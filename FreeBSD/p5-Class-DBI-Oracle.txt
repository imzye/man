Class::DBI::Oracle(3)                      User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Class::DBI::Oracle - Extensions to Class::DBI for Oracle

SYNOPSIS
         package Music::DBI;
         use base 'Class::DBI::Oracle';
         Music::DBI->set_db('Main', 'dbi:Oracle:tnsname', 'username', 'password');

         package Artist;
         use base 'Music::DBI';
         __PACKAGE__->set_up_table('Artist');

         # ... see the Class::DBI documentation for details on Class::DBI usage

DESCRIPTION
       This is an extension to Class::DBI that currently implements:

               * A sequence fix for Oracle databases.

               * Automatic column name discovery.

               * Automatic primary key detection.

               * Sequence name guessing.

               * Proper aliasing of reserved words.

       Instead of setting Class::DBI as your base class, use this.

BUGS
       The sequence guessing is just that. If your naming convention follows
       the defacto standard of TABLENAME_SEQ, and you only use one sequence
       per table, this will work.

       The primary and column name detection lowercases all names found. This
       is probably what you want. If it's not, don't use set_up_table.
