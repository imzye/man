_xt_ff_pclose(3)       FreeBSD Library Functions Manual       _xt_ff_pclose(3)




NAME
       _xt_ff_pclose() - Close a stream created by xt_ff_popen(3)


LIBRARY
       #include <xtend/fast-file.h>
       -lxtend




SYNOPSIS
       int     _xt_ff_pclose(xt_ff_t *stream)


ARGUMENTS
       stream  xt_ff_t stream opened by xt_ff_popen(3)


DESCRIPTION
       _xt_ff_pclose(3) closes a stream opened by xt_ff_popen(3), and waits
       for the child process to complete and returns its exit status.  Unlike
       the FILE stream functions popen(3) and pclose(3), it is not necessary
       to match xt_ff_popen(3) and _xt_ff_pclose(3).  The xt_ff_close(3)
       function automatically senses whether stream if a pipe (FIFO), and
       calls _xt_ff_pclose(3) or _xt_ff_raw_close(3) as needed.

       The xt_ff_t system is simpler than and much faster than traditional
       FILE on typical systems.  It is intended for processing large files
       character-by-character, where low-level block I/O is not convenient,
       but FILE I/O causes a bottleneck.


RETURN VALUES
       Exit status of the child process spawned by xt_ff_popen(3), or -1 on
       error


EXAMPLES

       xt_ff_t *instream;

       if ( (instream = xt_ff_popen("xzcat file.xz", O_RDONLY)) == NULL )
       {
           fprintf(stderr, "Failed to read xzcat file.xz.n");
           exit(EX_NOINPUT);
       }

       xt_ff_close(instream);
