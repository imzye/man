   Connect to IRC server
       freenode is a famous IRC network, the official channel of Srain #srain
       is also hosted on it. Let's start by connecting to freenode.

   Predefined Server
       Srain has a predefined list of commonly used IRC servers, freenode is
       one of it. If you want to add server into this list, refer to
       Configuration Manual.

       Click the connection button on the Srain header bar, select the page
       "Quick Mode", select the item "freenode" from candidate box with label
       "Server", enter your nickname, then click the "Connect" button:
         [image]

       If everything goes well, Srain should connected to freenode, then your
       would see some message from freenode's server:
         [image]

   Custom Server
       While the server your want to connect to is not listed in the
       predefined list, switch to the page "Advanced Mode", enter the
       hostname, port, and etc.

       NOTE:

          • If the port is a TLS port, make sure that the option "Use secure
            connection" is checked.

          • If the server's certificate is untrusted and you insist on
            continuing, check the option "Do not verify certificate".

       Then click the "Connect" button:
         [image]

   Using Command
       Refer to /server and /connect.

       If you want to automatically execute commands at each time Srain
       starts, please refer to Playground.

   Join Channel
       After connecting to freenode, now let's try to join #srain, the
       official channel of Srain.

   Directly Join
       While your has a clear channel to join, such as #srain, just click the
       join button, select the page "Join Channel", enter the channel name in
       the input entry with label "Channel", then click the "Join" button:
         [image]

       Now you should joined the channel:
         [image]

   Search Channel
       While you don't know the exact name of the channel, click the join
       button, switch to page "Search Channel", click the button with
       "refresh" icon, Srain should start receiving channel list from server.

       Then you can enter the keyword or specify the filter conditions to
       search channel. For example we enter "#s", select the channel you want
       to join from channe list, then click "Join" button to join it.
         [image]

       NOTE:
          If the channel requires a join password, try double click the row of
          channel.

   Using Command
       Refer to /join.

   Building
       You should install the aboved Dependencies on your platform before the
       following steps.

       Firstly, download source code of srain, you can get source code of
       latest release:

          $ wget https://github.com/SrainApp/srain/archive/1.7.0.tar.gz
          $ tar -xvzf 1.7.0.tar.gz
          $ cd srain-1.7.0

       Or get git version:

          $ git clone https://github.com/SrainApp/srain.git
          $ cd srain

   Play with Meson
       Srain use Meson with ninja backend as its build system.  You can build
       it via the following commands:

          $ meson setup builddir
          $ cd builddir
          $ ninja

       Install(root privileges required):

          $ cd builddir
          # ninja install

       HTML documentation and manpage are built and installed by default, if
       you don't need them, just set meson option doc_builders to an empty
       array when setup:

          $ meson setup -Ddoc_builders=[] builddir

   Makefile Helper
       We also provide a simple Makefile helper to simplify meson commands.
       It is convenient for development.

          $ make           # Build srain
          $ make build     # Same as above
          $ make install   # Install srain to prefix under project root
          $ make run       # Run srain with isolated $HOME and XDG Directory
          $ make debug     # Same as `make run`, but with GDB attached
          $ make inspect   # Same as `make run`, but with GtkInspector
          $ make clean     # Remove all compilation and installation result
          $ make doc       # View installed HTML documentation

   Distribution Packages
   GNU/Linux
   Arch Linux
       Packages srain and srain-git (git version) are available on AUR, it is
       quite easy to install using AUR helper(yay as an example):

          $ yay -S srain
          $ yay -S srain-git # git version

       If you are the user of Arch Linux CN Repository, try:

          # pacman -S archlinuxcn/srain
          # pacman -S archlinuxcn/srain-git # git version

   Debian
       Srain now in offical repository of Debian:

          # apt install srain

   Fedora
       Srain now in offical repository of fedora, use dnf to install it.

          # dnf install srain

   Flatpak

       cpba is maintaining Flatpak manifest for Srain and The built package is
       available on Flathub, just execute the following commands to install if
       you already have flatpak installed:

          $ flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
          $ flatpak install flathub im.srain.Srain

   Gentoo
       Please refers to gentoo portage overlays.

   openSUSE
       alois is maintaining openSUSE package for Srain, following this link to
       install it.

   Windows
       Srain requires Windows 7 or later.

   Pre-built package
       After 2020-08-10 Version 1.1.2, we provide Windows portable binary that
       you can get it from Github release page.

   Build byself
       If you want to build Srain on Windows youself, you should use the
       toolchains provided by MSYS2 project.

       Firstly install MSYS2, then open a MSYS2 shell, install the basic build
       tools:

          $ pacman -S base-devel
          $ pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-toolchain     # For 32-bit Windows
          $ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain   # For 64-bit Windows

       Then download the package script from MinGW PKGBUILD for Srain, run the
       following commands at the directory of PKGBUILD:

          $ MINGW_INSTALLS=mingw32 makepkg-mingw -fsi # For 32-bit Windows
          $ MINGW_INSTALLS=mingw64 makepkg-mingw -fsi # For 64-bit Windows

       If everything goes well, Srain is installed under your MinGW prefix.

       NOTE:
          If you suffer the "error while loading shared libraries: xxxx.dll:
          cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory" problem
          when running, please run it in cmd but not msys2 shell, and it will
          show you real missing library. [1]

   macOS
       WARNING:
          macOS support of Srain is still experimental.

       There is not a distribution package or package script for Srain on
       macOS, you should build Srain by yourself.

       Firstly install Homebrew, run the following commands to install
       dependencies:

          $ brew install coreutils gcc pkg-config # building
          $ brew install gettext glib-networking gtk+3 libsoup libconfig openssl adwaita-icon-theme

       Next, tell pkg-config where to find the libraries we just installed:

          export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:"/usr/local/opt/icu4c/lib/pkgconfig"
          export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:"/usr/local/opt/openssl@3/lib/pkgconfig"

       Then follow the steps in Building.

   Playground
       User can run commands in two ways, the one way is typing them into the
       input entry of chat buffer.

       The another way is writing the commands to the server.auto-run and
       chat.auto-run configuration items. For more details, please refer to
       Configuration Manual.

   Syntax
       A command is a line of string that has the following format, different
       elements are separated by whitespace:

          /<name|alias> [subcommand] [<option> [value]]... [argument]...

       User should use name to invoke a command.  The command's name starts
       with a slash / and doesn't contain any whitespace, such as: /join.
       Some commands have alias that can be used instead of name, for example,
       user can use /j instead of /join.

       NOTE:
          When you want to send a message starts with a slash, please prepend
          another slash to the message.  For example, you want to send "/this
          is a slash prefixed message", you need to type "//this is a slash
          prefixed message".

       A subcommand is a instruction behind the command name, it is optional.

       An option, as its name, is optional too, starts with a hyphen - and may
       has a value.

       option is often used as the switch of a flag or a way to change some
       default values. For example, The command /connect -tls -port 6697,
       option -tls is just a flag that tells srain use secure connections with
       TLS.  And -port requires a value, if -port is not specified, program
       will use the default value 6667. Check /connect for more details.

       If a value starts with a hyphen - or contains whitespaces, it should be
       enclosed by single quotation mark '.

       NOTE:
          All option should appear behind subcommand (If any), and before
          argument.

       An argument is similar to value, but commonly it doesn't have a default
       value so it can not be omitted (actually it depends on the implement of
       the command). If the first argument starts with a hyphen -, it should
       be enclosed by single quotation mark '. If an argument contains
       whitespaces, it should be quoted too. Specially, the last argument can
       contain whitespace without quoted.

       If you want to use a single quotation mark in a quoted text, use
       backslash \ to escape it. For backslash itself, use double backslash
       \\.

       Render message of specific user via specific pattern.

       The given pattern should contains specific Named Subpatterns used for
       capturing message fragment from original message content and become
       part of rendered message.

       There are list of available named subpatterns:

       • (?<sender>): match name of sender, once this subpatterns is matched,
         the original sender will be displayed as message remark

       • (?<content>): match content of rendered message

       • (?<time>): match time of rendered message

       Example:

       We assume that there is a IRC bot named "xmppbot".  It forwards message
       between XMPP and IRC.  On IRC side, the forwarded message looks like
       "<xmppbot> [xmpp_user] xmpp_message", you can render it to a more
       easy-to-read format via the following commands:

          /pattern add xmpp \[(?<sender>[^:]+?)\] (?<content>.*)
          /render xmppbot xmpp

       The forwarded meessage will look like "<xmpp_user> xmpp_message", and
       the original message sender "xmppbot" will be displayed as message
       remark.  Please refer to What is "relay message transform"? see its
       effect.

       NOTE:
          Pattern SHOULD consider the case where the mIRC color code is
          included in the message.

   Configuration Manual
       Srain uses Libconfig to process configuration file.

       • Configuration File

       • Syntax

       • Priority and Fallback

       • All Configurable Items

   Configuration File
       The path of system wide configuration file builtin.cfg depends on the
       compile flag --sysconfdir, default to be /etc/srain.

       The path of user wide configuration file srain.cfg is
       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/srain, usually it is ~/.config/srain
       (~/.var/app/im.srain.Srain for flatpak installs).

       The difference between system wide and user wide configuration file is
       the priority, The user wide configuration always overwrite the one in
       system wide configuration. For more details about priority, refer to
       Priority and Fallback.

   Syntax
       For the syntax of configuration file, please refer to Libconfig's
       documentation: Configuration Files

       For an example configuration, refer to All Configurable Items.

   Priority and Fallback
       A group is a collection of configurations. The same group in different
       place have different priority.

          server: { # A top level ``server`` group

              # ...

              user = {}
              default-messages = {}
              irc = {}
              chat = { } # A ``chat`` group directly in ``server``

              chat-list = (
                  { }, # A ``chat`` group in ``chat-list``
                  # ...
              )
          }

          server-list: (
              { }, # A ``server`` group in ``server-list``
              # ...
          )

       For example, A server group contains the information(not all) of
       connection to IRC servers.  server group can appear at the top level of
       configuration file, or be an element of server-list list with a unique
       name. The top level server is often used to specify the global
       configuration, and server-list is used to specify specified IRC
       servers.

       The configuration in server-list can overwrite the top level server,
       and if an option is not specified in server-list, It will fallback to
       server.

       Another similar group is chat, chat contains configuration of chat
       panel, such as whether to show topic, whether to save chat log and etc.
       Every server group can contain a chat group and a chat-list list.
       Elements in chat-list are also identified with an unique name.

       As same as the relationship between top level server and server-list,
       chat-list is used to specify a specified chat and has higher priority.

       As mentioned above, The priority of user configuration is always higher
       than system's, so we can get the priority sorting of server and chat
       group:

          server-list(user) >
          top level server(user) >
          server-list(system) >
          top level server(system)

          chat-list in server-list(user) >
          chat in server-list(user) >
          chat-list in top level server(user) >
          chat in top level server(user) >
          chat-list in server-list(system) >
          chat in server-list(system) >
          chat-list in top level server(system) >
          chat in top level server(system)

   All Configurable Items
       Here is the default system wide configuration file used by Srain, all
       configurable items are already listed here. you can make a copy as your
       user configuration file, but note:

       1. User configuration always overwrite system's, if you don't know what
          does this option means, please remove it from your user
          configuration rather than overwrite it

       2. The server's name in server-list is unique, please remoeve the
          duplicated server in server-list before using

       • How can I hide JOIN/PART messages of channel?

       • Why can't I login to my ZNC server?

   Does Srain support Windows?
       Yes, please refer to Windows.

   What is "relay message transform"?
       There are many relay bots forward messages from other IM to IRC
       network, "Relay message transform" make these messages easier to read.

       For example, there is a telegram bot named "telegram", the words in
       brackets is the named of the telegram user.
         [image]

       Run command /pattern add normal-relay \[(?<sender>[^:]+?)\]
       (?<content>.*) and /render telegram normal-relay, you get:
         [image]

       For more details, please refer to commands-pattern and commands-render.

   Where are the log files?
       Refer to Chat Logs.

   How can I send message which has a slash("/") prefixed?
       Please prepend another slash to the message.

       Refer to Syntax.

   How can I remove my stored password?
       Just leave the password entry empty and check the "Remember password"
       checkbox before connect to server or join channel, the corresponding
       password will be removed.

       Or you can use secret-tool (provided by libsecret) to manage all your
       stored passwords.

   How can I hide JOIN/PART messages of channel?
       So far, Srain has not yet a specialized option for hiding such
       messages.  You can use write regular expression to filter them:

          /pattern add filter-join ^\w+ has joined$
          /filter filter-join
          /pattern add filter-part ^\w+ has left: .*$
          /filter filter-part

       NOTE:
          The content of regular expression depends on your language.

   Why can't I login to my ZNC server?
       According ZNC's FAQ, way  2, supply your "user@phone/network:pass"
       (without quotes) in the server password field. Other as usual.

       NOTE:
          Way 1 in ZNC's FAQ requires username field can be set via connection
          panel, which will be supported by Srain in the future.
