SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, add this line to the kernel
     configuration file:

           device bhnd

     To compile driver support for all additional devices found in embedded
     systems, add the following additional lines to the kernel configuration
     file:

           device cfi
           device gpio
           device spibus
           device uart

     To load the driver as a module at boot, add this line to loader.conf(5):

           bhnd_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The bhnd_chipc driver supports the ChipCommon core found in Broadcom Home

     including device identification, UARTs, CFI and SPI flash, One-time
     Programmable (OTP) Memory, and GPIO.
