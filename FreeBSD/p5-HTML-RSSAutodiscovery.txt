NAME
       HTML::RSSAutodiscovery - methods for retreiving RSS-ish information
       from an HTML document.

SYNOPSIS
        use HTML::RSSAutodiscovery;
        use Data::Dumper;

        my $url = "http://www.diveintomark.org/";

        my $html = HTML::RSSAutodiscovery->new();
        print &Dumper($html->parse($url));

        # Mark's gone a bit nuts with this and
        # the list is too long to include here...

        # see the POD for the 'parse' method for
        # details of what it returns.

DESCRIPTION
       Methods for retreiving RSS-ish information from an HTML document.

PACKAGE METHODS
   __PACKAGE__->new()
       Object constructor. Returns an object. Woot!

OBJECT METHODS
   $obj->parse($arg)
       Parse an HTML document and return RSS-ish &lt;link> information.

       $arg may be either:

       •   An HTML string, passed as a scalar reference.

       •   A URI.

       Returns an array reference of hash references whose keys are :

       •   title

       •   type

       •   rel

       •   href

   $obj->locate($uri,\%args)
       Like the parse method, but will perform additional lookups, if
       necessary or specified.

       Valid arguments are

       •   uri

           String. A live, breathing URI to slurp and parse.

           Required

       •   Hash ref whose keys may be

           •   noparse

               Boolean. Don't bother parsing the document, this will also
               prevent you from checking for embedded links.

               I don't know why you want to do this, but you can.

               False, by default.

           •   embedded

               Boolean. Check all embedded links ending in '.xml', '.rss' or
               '.rdf' (and then 'xml', 'rss' or 'rdf') for RSS-ness.

               False, by default, unless the initial parsing of the URI
               returns no RSS links.

           •   embedded_and_remote

               Boolean.

               Boolean. Check all embedded links whose root is not the same as
               $uri for RSS-ness.

               False, by default.

           •   syndic8

               Boolean. Check the syndic8 servers for sites matching $uri

               False, by default, unless the initial parsing of the URI and
               any embedded links returns no RSS links.

       Returns an array reference of hash references whose keys are :

       •   title

       •   type

       •   rel

       •   href

REQUIREMENTS
   BASIC
       These packages are required to actually parse an HTML document or URI.

       •   HTML::Parser

       •   LWP::UserAgent

       •   HTTP::Request

   EMBEDDED
       These packages are required to check the embedded links in a URI for
       RSS files.  They are not loaded until run-time so they are not required
       for doing basic parsing

       •   XML::RSS

   SYNDIC8
       These packages are required to query the syndic8 servers for RSS files
       associated with a URI.  They are not loaded until run-time so they are
       not required for doing basic parsing

       •   XMLRPC::Lite
