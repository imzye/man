              creation time.

       shared_database_path string

              Path to shared.db database file. If not set, we use the default
              path.  you can set this to be a file in a synced folder (e.g.
              dropbox folder) to automatically sync sioyek across multiple

              For example,


       •      search_url_g https://www.duckduckgo.com/search?q=


       •      middle_click_search_engine g

              Will use the duckduckgo address for middle click search.

       shift_middle_click_search_engine string

              Search engine to use for shift middle click lookup. Value is

              cause it to be blurry if it is 1, we rerender with the proper
              resolution for overview window which looks better but may
              increase power consumption.

       wheel_zoom_on_cursor boolean

              Normally mouse wheel zooms in on the middle of the screen, but
              if this is set to 1, we zoom in on the cursor.

       linear_filter boolean

              Apply linear texture filtering by passing GL_LINEAR to
              glTexParameteri. This means that for a pixture being textured,
              we use the weighted average of the four texture elements closest
              to its center.

       display_resolution_scale float

              using the copy_window_size_config command.

              If this is not set, then we use the full size of the first
              screen if there are multiple monitors, otherwise we use half of

              Default size (in width and height) of the helper window when it
              is opened.

              If not set, use the full size of the second screen if there are

              If set, we initially collapse table of content entries.

       ruler_mode boolean

              If set, we highlight the current line in visual_scroll_mode by

              command toggle_fastread) by default queries a url for
              information about which characters of each word on the page to
              highlight. An implementation of such a server based on a
              language model is available here:
              https://github.com/ahrm/sioyek/blob/main/scripts/summary_highlight_server.py.

              By default, both this script and sioyek will bind to
              localhost:5000.


       text_summary_should_refine boolean

              Language model option for the fastread server program. If 1,
              then prevent highlights in the middle of words by always
              highlighting starting from the beginning of the word until the
              first mispredicted character.

       text_summary_should_fill boolean

              Language model option for the fastread server program. If 1,
              then highlight the entire word when over 50% of it is
              highlighted.

       text_summary_context_size integer

              Use heuristic if text summary url does not return highlights.
              The heuristic involves choosing ceiling(length*0.3) characters
              of every word to emphasize.

       papers_folder_path string

              A directory which sioyek watches for new papers. If a new paper
              added to this directory while we are creating a portal from
              another document, this new document will automatically be used
              as the destination of the portal.

              Enable possibly unstable experimental features

       create_table_of_contents_if_not_exists boolean

              Automatically create a table of contents for the document if it
              doesn't already have one.

       max_created_toc_size integer

              Limits the maximum size of created table of contents.

       force_custom_line_algorithm boolean

              Use custom algorithm based on pixmaps to compute rectangles
              around the lines of the document.

       overview_size fvec[2]

              Size, width and height, of the overview window. The overview
              window is triggered by right clicking on an internal link, or
              hovering if hover_overview is set to 1.

       overview_offset fvec[2]

              Offset of the overview window as floats from the center of the
              page.

       ignore_whitespace_in_presentation_mode boolean

              Always use fit_to_page_smart (ignoring whitespace) in
              presentation view.

       exact_highlight_select boolean

              If set to 0, then in word select mode, select the whole word
              even if the cursor is only partially on the word. If set to 1,
              then select the word only if the range of the cursor's selection
              fully includes the word.

       show_doc_path boolean

              If set to 0, then only show the filename in the dialog to choose
              to open a previous doc (open_prev_doc). If 1, then show the
              entire file path.

       fastread_opacity float

              Opacity of the dimmed portion of words in fastread mode.

       highlight_color_* color_3

              Color of the highlight color bound to symbol * (should be one
              character).

       should_warn_about_user_key_override boolean

              If set to 0, then don't warn the user about key definition
              overrides when the two definitions are in different files. If
              set to 1, then always warn the user when keys are overridden.

       single_click_selects_words boolean

              If set to 0, then single clicks select words and double clicks
              allow selection of arbitrary ranges of characters. If set to 1,
              then double clicks select words and single clicks allow
              selection of arbitrary ranges of characters.

       highlight_middle_click boolean

              If set to 1, then middle clicks add a highlight with
              select_highlight_type when a selection is active and no preview
              is open. If set to 0, a smart jump is always attempted.

       super_fast_search boolean

              If set to 0, search is performed by the mupdf backend. If set to
              1, a super fast search index is used instead. This leads to a
              slight increase in memory.

       case_sensitive_search boolean

              If set to 1, search and regex_search are case-sensitive. If set
              to 0, search and regex search are case-insensitive.
