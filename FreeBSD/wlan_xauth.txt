WLAN_XAUTH(4)          FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual          WLAN_XAUTH(4)

NAME
     wlan_xauth – External authenticator support for 802.11 devices

SYNOPSIS
     device wlan_xauth

DESCRIPTION
     The wlan_xauth module is a wlan(4) authenticator plugin for use with
     user-mode authentication implementations such as hostapd.  It hooks into
     the 802.11 layer and does nothing.  As a result, 802.11 stations that
     associate are not authorized to send or receive frames until they are
     authorized by an external agent; typically using a protocol such as WPA,
     802.1x, or 802.11i.

     This module is automatically loaded by the rc script that normally starts
     hostapd(8).

STANDARDS
     More information can be found in the IEEE 802.11, WPA, and 802.11i
     Standards.

HISTORY
     The wlan_xauth driver first appeared in FreeBSD 6.0.
