       fy-testsuite [OPTIONS] <file>

       fy-filter [OPTIONS] [-f*FILE*] [<path> ...]

DESCRIPTION
       fy-tool is a general YAML/JSON manipulation tool using libfyaml.  Its
       operation is different depending on how it's called, either via aliases
       named fy-dump, fy-testsuite, fy-filter, fy-join, or via the --dump,
       --testsuite, --filter, --join, --ypath and --compose options.

       • In dump mode it will parse YAML/JSON input files and output YAML/JSON
         according to the output format options.

       • In testsuite mode it will parse a single YAML input file and output
         yaml testsuite reference output.

       • In filter mode it will parse YAML/JSON files and output YAML/JSON
         output filtered according to the given option.

       • In join mode it will parse YAML/JSON files and join them into a
         single YAML/JSON document according to the given command line
         options.

       • In ypath mode it will parse YAML/JSON files and execute a ypath query
         which will output a document stream according to the results. This is
         an experimental mode under development, where the syntax is not yet
         decided completely.

       • In compose mode, it operates similarly to dump, but the document tree
         is created using the built-in composer API.

OPTIONS
       A number of options are common for all the different modes of operation
       and they are as follows: Common options.INDENT 0.0

       -q, --quiet
              Quiet operation, does not output informational messages at all.

       -h, --help
              Display usage information.

       -v, --version
              Display version information.

       -I DIR, --include=DIR
              Add the DIR  directory to the search path which will be used to
              locate a YAML/JSON file.  The default path is set to ""

       -d LEVEL, --debug-level=LEVEL
              Set the minimum numeric debug level value of the library to
              LEVEL.  The numeric value must be in the range of 0 to 4 and
              their meaning is as follows:

              • 0 (DEBUG)

                Internal library debugging messages. No output is produced
                when the library was compiled with --disable-debug

              • 1 (INFO)

                Informational messages about the internal operation of the
                library.

              • 2 (NOTICE)

                Messsages that could require attention.

              • 3 (WARNING)

                A warning message, something is wrong, but operation can
                continue.  This is the default value.

              • 4 (ERROR)

                A fatal error occured, it is impossible to continue.

              The default level is 3 (WARNING), which means that messages with
              level 3 and higher will be displayed.
       Parser Options.INDENT 0.0

       -j JSONOPT, --json=JSONOPT
              Marks the input files as JSON or YAML accordingly to:

              • no

                The input files are always in YAML mode.

              • force

                The input files are always set to JSON mode.

              • auto

                The input files are set to JSON mode automatically when the
                file's extension is .json. This is the default.

              JSON support is complete so all valid JSON files are parsed
              according to JSON rules, even where those differ with YAML
              rules.

       --yaml-1.1
              Force YAML 1.1 rules, when input does not specify a version via
              a directive.

       --yaml-1.2
              Force YAML 1.2 rules, when input does not specify a version via
              a directive.

       --yaml-1.3
              Force YAML 1.3 rules, when input does not specify a version via
              a directive.  This option is experimental since the 1.3 spec is
              not yet released.

       --disable-accel
              Disable use of acceleration features; use less memory but
              potentially more CPU.

       --disable-buffering
              Disable use stdio bufferring, reads will be performed via unix
              fd reads. This may reduce latency when reading from a network
              file descriptor, or similar.

       --disable-depth-limit
              Disable the object depth limit, which is usually set to a value
              near 60.  Using this option is is possible to process even
              pathological inputs when using the default non-recursive build
              mode.

       --prefer-recursive
              Prefer recursive build methods, instead of iterative. This field
              is merely here for evaluation purposes and will be removed in a
              future version.

       --sloppy-flow-indentation
              Use sloppy flow indentation, where indentation is not taken into
              account in flow mode, even when the input is invalid YAML
              according to the spec.

       --ypath-aliases
              Process aliases using ypaths. Experimental option.

       --streaming
              Only valid when in dump mode, enables streaming mode. This means
              that no in-memory graph tree is constructed, so indefinite and
              arbitrary large YAML input streams can be processed.

              Note that in streaming mode:

              • Key duplication checks are disabled.

              • No reording of key order is possible when emitting (i.e.
                --sort is not available).

              • Alias resolution is not available (i.e. --resolve).
       Resolver Options.INDENT 0.0

       -r, --resolve
              Perform anchor and merge key resolution. By default this option
              is disabled.

       -l, --follow
              Follow aliases when performing path traversal. By default this
              option is disabled.
       Testsuite Options.INDENT 0.0

       --disable-flow-markers
              Do not output flow-markers for the testsuite output.
Emitter Options.INDENT 0.0

       -i INDENT, --indent=INDENT
              Sets the emitter indent (in spaces). Default is 2.

       -w WIDTH, --width=WIDTH
              Sets the preferred output width of the emitter. It is generally
              impossible to strictly adhere to this limit so this is treated
              as a hint at best.  It not valid in any oneline output modes
              (i.e. flow-oneline or json-oneline).  Default value is 80.

       -m MODE, --mode=MODE
              Sets the output mode of the YAML emitted. Possible values are:

              • original

                The original formatting used in the input. This is default
                mode.

              • block

                The output is forced to be in block mode. All flow constructs
                will be converted to block mode.

              • flow

                The output is forced to be in flow mode. All block constructs
                will be converted to flow mode.

              • flow-oneline

                The output is forced to be in flow mode, but no newlines will
                be emitted; the output is going to be a (potentially very)
                long line.

              • json

                The output is forced to be in JSON mode. Note that it is
                impossible to output an arbitrary YAML file as JSON, so this
                may fail.

              • json-oneline

                The output is forced to be in JSON mode and in a single line.

              • dejson

                Output is in block YAML mode but with special care to convert
                JSON quoted strings in as non-idiomatic YAML as possible.  For
                example { foo: "this is a test" } will be emitted as foo: this
                is a test. YAML can handle scalars without using excessive
                quoting.

       -C MODE, --color=MODE
              It is possible to colorize output using ANSI color escape
              sequences, and the mode can be one of:

              • off

                Never colorize output.

              • on

                Always colorize output.

              • auto

                Automatically colorize output when the output is a terminal.
                This is the default.

       -V, --visible
              Make all whitespace (spaces, unicode spaces and linebreaks)
              visible.  Note that this is performed using UTF8 characters so
              it will not work on non-UTF8 terminals, or a non-UTF8 complete
              font.

       -s, --sort
              Sort keys on output. This option is disabled by default.

       -c, --comment
              Experimental output comments option. Enabled output while
              preserving comments.  Disabled by default.

       --strip-labels
              Strip labels on output. Disabled by default.

       --strip-tags
              Strip tags on output. Disabled by default.

       --strip-doc
              Strip document indicators on output. Disabled by default.

       --null-output
              Do not generate any output, useful for profiling the parser.
       YPATH options.INDENT 0.0

       --dump-pathexpr
              Dump the produced path expression for debugging.

       --no-exec
              Do not execute the expression. Useful when used with
              --dump-pathexpr
       Compose options.INDENT 0.0

       --dump-path
              Dump the path while composing.
Tool mode select options.INDENT 0.0

       --dump Select dump mode of operation. This is the default.  This mode
              is also enabled when the called binary is aliased to fy-dump.

              In this mode, all files provided in the command line will be
              dumped in one continuous stream, to the standard output, using
              document start indicators to mark the start of end new file.

              If the file provided is - then the input is the standard input.

       --testsuite
              Select testsuite mode of operation.  This mode is also enabled
              when the called binary is aliased to fy-testsuite.

              In this mode, a single YAML file is read and an event stream is
              generated which is the format used for yaml-testsuite
              compliance.

              If the file provided is - then the input is the standard input.

       --filter
              Select filter mode of operation.  This mode is also enabled when
              the called binary is aliased to fy-filter.

              In this mode, a single YAML file is read from the standard input
              for each path that is provided in the command line a document
              will be produced to the standard output.  To use file instead of
              standard input use the -f/--file option.

              If the file provided is - then the input is the standard input.

              -f FILE, --file=FILE
                     Use the given file as input instead of standard input.

                     If  first character of FILE is > the the input is the
                     content of the option that follows.  For example --file
                     ">foo: bar" is as --file file.yaml with file.yaml "foo:
                     bar"

       --join Select join mode of operation.  This mode is also enabled when
              the called binary is aliased to fy-join.

              In this mode, multiple YAML files are joined into a single
              document, emitted to the standard output.

              If the file provided is - then the input is the standard input.

              -T PATH, --to=PATH
                     The target path of the join. By default this is the root
                     /.

                     If  first character of FILE is > the the input is the
                     content of the option that follows.

              -F PATH, --from=PATH
                     The origin path of the join (for each input). By default
                     this is the root /.

                     If  first character of FILE is > the the input is the
                     content of the option that follows.

              -t PATH, --trim=PATH
                     Trim path of the output of the join. By default this is
                     the root /.

                     If  first character of FILE is > the the input is the
                     content of the option that follows.

       --ypath
              Process files and output query results using ypath.

       --compose
              Use the composer API to build the document instead of direct
              events.

       fy-testsuite example.

       An example using the testsuite mode generates the following event
       stream from invoice.yaml

       Parse and dump test-suite event format

          $ fy-testsuite invoice.yaml
       fy-filter examples.

       Filter out from the /bill-to path of invoice.yaml

          $ cat invoice.yaml | fy-filter /bill-to

              Suite #292

       Filter example with arrays (and use the --file option)

          $ fy-filter --file=mergekeyspec.yaml /5

          ---
          <<: *CENTER
          r: 10
          label: center/big

       Follow anchors example

          $ fy-filter --file=simple-anchors.yaml /baz/bar

          frooz

       Handle YAML bombs (if you can spare the memory and cpu time)

          $ fy-filter --file=bomb.yaml -r / | wc -l
          6726047

       You don't have to, you can just follow links to retrieve data.

          $ fy-filter --file=stuff/bomb.yaml -l --strip-label /g/0/1/2/3/4/5/6

          "lol"

       Following links works with merge keys too:

          $ fy-filter --file=mergekeyspec.yaml -l --strip-label /5/x

          --- 1
       fy-join examples.

       Joining two YAML files that have root mappings.

          $ fy-join simple-anchors.yaml invoice.yaml

          foo: &label {
              bar: frooz
            }
          baz: *label
          invoice: 34843
          date: !!str 2001-01-23
          bill-to: &id001

                Suite #292

       Join two files with sequences at root:

          $ fy-join -mblock ">[ foo, bar ]" ">[ baz ]"

          - foo
          - bar
          - baz
