DESCRIPTION
       mytool is a my map file manipulation program in the yudit distribution.
       It can generates so-called binary nbit ( my ) map file that can map any
       sequences of bytes into any sequences of bytes. These sequences of
       bytes can be grouped into 1,2,4 and 8 bytes long words.  The input
       sequence length may be different from the matched sequence length. 'i /
       'n -> 'b specifies that the word 'in' produces 'b' but only the 'i is
       consumed from the input buffer.

       It can also generate a so-called binary umap file, that maps 8 or 16
       bit single words into 16 bit single words and it contains the reverse
       map too.

       It can also disassemble the input map and produce a mys source file.

       The input can be a binary umap file, a my file, mys file a uni and a
       kmap file for yudit. It is recommended that all kmap files use the new
       mys format because it gives more freedom to define the mapping.

       The yudit distribution has a simple document yudit/doc/my.doc on the
       binary map formats, and a source file example file
       yudit/mytool/my/example.mys please refer to this for more details.

OPTIONS
       -info  prints out a small information on the current map.

       -test  lets you test the map interactively.

       -showkeys
              show all the keys in the map file.

       -encode
              builds a state machine in the encoding part of the map file. The
              resulting map file can be written to disk with the -write option
              The resulting my files can contain state machines to speed-up
              conversion. A state machine based my file can manifest 10%-70%
              performance improvement, so it may be desirable for encoding
              fontmaps.  For fontmaps the bumap format might be better suited
              where only one character and not a sequence of characters need
              to be mapped.

       -decode
              builds a state machine in the decoding part of the map file.

       -strip
              strips off the state machines from the map files.  The -write
              option can be used to save the new map file.

       -benchmark
              option performs a simple benchmark test on the map file, to
              compare speed of simple, state machine based and binary map
              based map files.

       -nocomment
              option strips all comments from an input source file of format
              mys kmap uni.  It does not strip comments from a binary file.

       -name new-name
              assigns a name to the map file.

       -comment new-comment
              assigns a comment to the map file.


       -type new-type
              assigns a map file a distinctive type, that can be kmap or
              fontmap but it is only informative. Keymaps can be used as
              fontmaps and vice versa.

       -write output-file
              writes the data into an output file.  mytool never modifies the
              original file. All modifications should be explicitly saved with
              the this option.  Never specify the same file for input and
              output.

       -my input-file
              load a binary map file. Only one of this option can be
              specified.

       -mys input-source-file
              load a source file.

       -rmys input-source-file
              load a source file and reverse it - make encoding  from
              decoding and vice versa.


       -kmap input-source-file
              load a source file in kmap format.

       -rkmap input-source-file
              load a source file and reverse it - make encoding  from
              decoding and vice versa.


       -uni:l,u input-source-file
              load a source file in Unicode Consortium format. This format has
              the local code in column l, and unicode in column u. The
              numbering of columns start from 0.

       -runi:l,u input-source-file
              load a source file in Unicode Consortium format and reverses it.
              Make encoding from decoding and vice versa.


       -8     option can be used with the -uni  or -runi  options. It
              specifies that the input is 8 bit and not 16 bit.

       -high  option can be used with the -uni  or -runi  options. It
              specifies that the key should be or'ed with 0x8080.

       -low   option can be used with the -uni  or -runi  options. It
              specifies that the key should be and'ed with 0x7f7f.


       -convert output-file-format
              converts the map file to a format. It is useful only when
              combined with -write  option.  The possible formats are my
              -binary, mys -source, myc -my-c-source, umap -umap-c-source,
              bumap -binary-umap formats.  For maps where only a single 8 or
              16 bit local code  should be converted into 16 bit unicode and
              vice versa, the umap file formats are recommended.  The c-source
              files are provided so that you can inlucde a full map into the c
              program.

DIAGNOSTICS
       mytool prints out an error message and exits with a non-zero status on
       error.  If there is no error the exit status is zero.
