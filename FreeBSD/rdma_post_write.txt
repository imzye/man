RDMA_POST_WRITE(3)       Librdmacm Programmer's Manual      RDMA_POST_WRITE(3)



NAME
       rdma_post_write - post an RDMA write work request.

SYNOPSIS
       #include <rdma/rdma_verbs.h>

       int rdma_post_write (struct rdma_cm_id *id, void *context, void *addr,
       size_t length, struct ibv_mr *mr, int flags, uint64_t remote_addr,
       uint32_t rkey);

ARGUMENTS
       id          A reference to a communication identifier where the request
                   will be posted.

       context     User-defined context associated with the request.

       addr        The local address of the source of the write request.

       length      The length of the write operation.

       mr          Optional memory region associated with the local buffer.

       flags       Optional flags used to control the write operation.

       remote_addr The address of the remote registered memory to write into.

       rkey        The registered memory key associated with the remote
                   address.

DESCRIPTION
       Posts a work request to the send queue of the queue pair associated
       with the rdma_cm_id.  The contents of the local data buffer will be
       written into the remote memory region.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error.  If an error occurs, errno will
       be set to indicate the failure reason.

NOTES
       For a list of supported flags, see ibv_post_send.  Unless inline data
       is specified, the local data buffer must have been registered before
       the write is issued, and the buffer must remain registered until the
       write completes.  The remote buffer must always be registered.

       Write operations may not be posted to an rdma_cm_id or the
       corresponding queue pair until it has been connected.

       The user-defined context associated with the write request will be
       returned to the user through the work completion wr_id, work request
       identifier, field.
