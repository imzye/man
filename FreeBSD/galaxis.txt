GALAXIS(6)                           Games                          GALAXIS(6)

NAME
       galaxis - rescue lifeboats lost in interstellar space

SYNOPSIS
       galaxis

DESCRIPTION
       Lifeboats from a crippled interstellar liner are adrift in a starfield.
       To find them, you can place probes that look in all eight compass
       directions and tell you how many lifeboats they see. If you drop a
       probe directly on a lifeboat it will be revealed immediately. Your
       objective: find the lifeboats as quickly as possible, before the
       stranded passengers run out of oxygen!

       This is a UNIX-hosted, curses-based clone of the nifty little Macintosh
       freeware game Galaxis. It doesn't have the super-simple,
       point-and-click interface of the original, but compensates by
       automating away some of the game's simpler deductions.

       To run it, simply type `galaxis'. The game screen includes a
       description of all commands, including `?' for detailed help.

AUTHORS
       The Macintosh game was designed and written by Christian Franz
       <cfranz@iiic.ethz.ch>. This version was cloned by Eric S. Raymond

BUGS
       This really ought to be an X game, but that would have been too much
       like work.
