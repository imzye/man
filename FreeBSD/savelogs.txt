NAME
       savelogs - Log file rotation made easy

SYNOPSIS
       savelogs was written with log file rotation in mind. With it you can
       ensure that your account does not run out of disk space because of
       large log files. It allows you to preserve important Web traffic
       information and system data while conserving precious disk space.

DESCRIPTION
       This document details several uses of savelogs designed to meet
       specific challenges in log file rotation. Some of the examples in this
       tutorial are taken from the savelogs(1) man page.

       savelogs was written with the axiom "make the common case fast" in
       mind. This means that assumptions were made about what most people want
       to do with their log files and that savelogs was optimized to make the
       common scenarios intuitive and simple.

       If these assumptions are not correct for your particular need, it may
       mean that what you're trying to do could possibly be done in a better
       way, or that perhaps you should reconsider what you're trying to do.
       Equally likely, it could mean that the assumptions savelogs makes
       really aren't correct after all; I'm sure the author would love to hear
       about it ;o)

       This document does not replace the savelogs(1) manual page. You should
       read the savelogs man page thoroughly before reading this document.
       Examples in this document are for savelogs version 1.32 or later (or as
       otherwise specified--version specific directives are noted).

EXAMPLES
       The rest of this document contains a variety of examples of different
       ways to use savelogs. Each example describes a problem scenario and
       then explains possible ways to solve the problem using savelogs.

       savelogs can be run from the command-line or as a cron job. Options may
       be given to savelogs using a configuration file or the command-line. In
       our descriptions of problems and solutions we will use savelogs
       configuration files rather than command-line options to control
       savelogs's behavior.

       For each solution offered, there will be a complete savelogs
       configuration file given along with any command-line arguments if
       needed. If no command-line is shown (either via cron or a shell
       prompt), you should assume that the command-line is:

           % savelogs --config=/path/to/savelogs.conf

       or a sample cron job:

           5 2 * * * $HOME/usr/local/bin/savelogs --config=/path/to/savelogs.conf

EXAMPLE 1: ARCHIVING SYSTEM LOGS
       Most core network services, log special information to the system log
       file /var/log/messages. sendmail, popper, imapd, and ftpd all write
       authentication and some debugging information to this file. This
       information is important to track down problems, compile server usage
       statistics, and record possible hacker attempts.

       Unfortunately, many people simply delete this file daily or weekly
       because of how quickly it can grow on heavily loaded servers. Some of
       these people often regret deleting their logs so quickly when a
       security incident occurs for which they need to review some of the
       information in their system log.

       Now we're convinced that we should keep the system log around for a
       little while. What approach should we take to preserve log files?

       This example will illustrate three popular methods of system log
       archival: permanent storage in separate archives, permanent storage in
       a single archive, and newsyslog(8) style rotation.

Possible Solution 1: Permanent storage in separate archives
       We want our system log file rotated daily to preserve disk space and
       keep order; this will let us quickly find a particular log and view it.

       Create the following savelogs configuration file:

   savelogs Configuration File
           ## ==== begin savelogs-1a.conf ==== ##

           ## our log file we want to rotate
           Log    /var/log/messages
           Touch  yes

           ## ===== end savelogs-1a.conf ===== ##

   Solution Results
       Before we run savelogs with the above configuration file, we might see
       something like this in our ~/var/log directory:

           server% ls -l
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser    4455 Sep 12 08:24 messages

       After we run savelogs with the above configuration file, we'll would
       see this in our ~/var/log directory:

           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser       0 Sep 12 12:01 messages
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser    1047 Sep 12 08:24 messages.010912.gz

   Solution Explanation
       The Log directive in our configuration file tells savelogs which log to
       process. You may specify the Log directive multiple times to process
       multiple logs.

       The Touch directive tells savelogs to execute the system touch command
       which creates an empty log file. While most services do not require the
       log file to already exist before appending to it, it is a good habit to
       create empty log files since a) it does no harm and b) some programs
       will not create the log file for you and will not log until it is
       created.

       An alternative to this solution is to also specify the Ext directive in
       the configuration file:

           ## ==== begin savelogs-1b.conf ==== ##

           ## our log file we want to rotate
           Log    /var/log/messages
           Touch  yes
           Ext    yesterday

           ## ===== end savelogs-1b.conf ===== ##

       which will create a file like this:

           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser    1047 Sep 12 08:24 messages.010911.gz

       Notice that the date in the file extension is a day before the previous
       example's date. You may want to do this if you run savelogs just after
       midnight but want the name of the archived log to reflect the date for
       which the log file contains data (instead of the day after).

       Yet another alternative is to specify a date format for the rotation.
       This gives you a lot of flexibility when renaming log files.

                  ## ==== begin savelogs-1c.conf ==== ##

                  ## our log file we want to rotate
                  Log     /var/log/messages
                  DateFmt %y-%m-%d

                  ## ===== end savelogs-1c.conf ===== ##

       which will create a file like this:

           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser    1047 Sep 12 08:24 messages.01-09-12.gz

       You can see that the log extension has hyphens between year, month, and
       day as we described in our DateFmt directive. You could even specify
       hours, minutes, and seconds if you wanted; all these options (and
       more!) are described in the strftime(1) man page.

Possible Solution 2: Permanent storage in a single archive
       The previous solution is a fine solution for most uses: it's easy to
       tell which logs contain data for a given date range. Even if you ran
       savelogs less often than daily (e.g., weekly or monthly) you would
       easily be able to tell which log had the data you wanted.

       You'll notice, however, that if you do run savelogs often (e.g., daily
       or hourly) in just a few days you'll have more logs than you would like
       to look at. You could download files to another machine periodically in
       order to reduce the sheer numbers of files to work with. Or you could
       use this next approach and store all logs in a compressed archive.

   savelogs Configuration File
           ## ==== begin savelogs-1d.conf ==== ##

           ## our log file we want to rotate
           Log      /var/log/messages
           Touch    yes
           Process  all

           ## ===== end savelogs-1d.conf ===== ##

   Solution Results
       When we run savelogs with the above configuration file, we'll see this
       in our ~/var/log directory:

           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser       0 Sep 12 12:01 messages
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser    1150 Sep 12 13:01 messages.tar.gz

       The contents of messages.tar.gz is a single file:

           server% gtar -ztf messages.tar.gz
           messages.010912

       You may also use the Ext option in your configuration file again if you
       wish the stored file to have yesterday's date instead of today's date
       (default).

   Solution Explanation
       This savelogs configuration file looks a lot like our previous example
       except that we have added the Process directive. The Process directive
       tells savelogs which phases to include while processing logs. The
       savelogs phases are:

       move
           Log files are renamed to whatever you specify in the Ext directive
           (which is today's date by default) during the move phase.

       filter
           The filter process phase takes the recently renamed log files (or
           file) and pipes them through a command that you specify. If you
           don't specify a filter command, this phase is quietly skipped.

       archive
           During the archive phase, logs which have been renamed (and
           optionally filtered) are added to a tar archive.

       compress
           The compress phase takes logs and compresses them. If the archive
           process phase was activated in this savelogs session, the compress
           phase will compress the archive instead of the log file.

       delete
           After logs have been optionally renamed, filtered, archived, and
           compressed, the original file (or the file after it has been
           renamed) may be deleted because it now resides in an archive. This
           occurs during the delete phase.

       If no Process option is given, savelogs uses move,compress as its
       default setting.

       We specified all for our Process option; this means that savelogs
       should apply all phases if they are applicable. As such, our log file,
       ~/var/log/messages is first renamed to ~/var/log/messages.010912.
       Because we did not specify a filter, the log file is not modified in
       any way after it is renamed. Then during the archive phase, the file is
       added to a new tar archive. The archive is compressed during the
       compress phase and the original file, ~/var/log/messages.010911 is
       deleted during the delete phase.

       Now each night when savelogs runs, the previous day's log file will be
       added to this single archive and compressed.

Possible Solution 3: newsyslog(8) style rotation
       The primary drawback to using a single archive for storage is that you
       never really save space by log compression. Yes, the archive is
       compressed most of the time, but savelogs is limited by the underlying
       system gtar or tar to modify archives. Currently, neither gtar nor tar
       can write to compressed tar files; they can only read from them.

       This means that before savelogs can write to the compressed tar file,
       it must first decompress it, then append the new file, then re-compress
       the file. If you have many log files, this may take considerable disk
       space.

       This final solution involves a compromise which minimizes storage space
       requirements while maintaining only a predetermined number of files in
       the ~/var/log directory. The compromise is that your log files are not
       as easily indexed because the date is not stored in the filename.

   savelogs Configuration File
           ## ==== begin savelogs-1e.conf ==== ##

           ## our log file we want to rotate
           Log      /var/log/messages
           Touch    yes
           Period   25

           ## ===== end savelogs-1e.conf ===== ##

   Solution Results
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser       0 Sep 12 13:35 messages
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser    1042 Sep 12 08:24 messages.0.gz

   Solution Explanation
       If we were to run savelogs with the above configuration file many
       times, you would see files like this:

           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser    1163 Sep 16 08:24 messages.0.gz
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser    1388 Sep 15 08:24 messages.1.gz
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser    1021 Sep 14 08:24 messages.2.gz
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser    1048 Sep 13 08:24 messages.3.gz
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser    1042 Sep 12 08:24 messages.4.gz

       You can see that the most recent log file is named messages.0.gz and
       the oldest log file has the highest number. With the Period directive
       in our configuration file, we will save 25 periods of logs. That is, if
       we ran savelogs daily, we would have 25 days worth of logs stored
       (maximum. After 25, logs begin to "fall off" the end--the oldest logs
       are not renamed but simply clobbered by more recent logs). If we ran
       savelogs hourly, we would have 25 hours worth of logs.

       This style of log rotation is called newsyslog-style rotation, named
       after newsyslog(8) which is a UNIX system utility that does
       approximately the same thing.

EXAMPLE 2: ARCHIVING MULTIPLE SYSTEM LOGS
       Now we have multiple system logs we would like to archive like we did
       in the previous example. In addition to ~/var/log/messages we also want
       to archive ~/var/log/procmail and ~/var/mail/cron.

Possible Solution 1: an archive for each file
       The simplest approach is to archive each file separately. Each file is
       easily accessible and cleanly indexed with the date embedded in the
       filename.

   savelogs Configuration File
           ## ==== begin savelogs-2a.conf ==== ##

           ## our log file we want to rotate
           Log      /var/log/messages
           Log      /var/log/procmail
           Log      /var/mail/cron
           Touch    yes

           ## ===== end savelogs-2a.conf ===== ##

   Solution Results
       In ~/var/log:

           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser       0 Sep 12 14:19 procmail
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser     159 Sep 12 14:03 procmail.010912.gz
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser       0 Sep 12 14:19 messages
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser    1047 Sep 12 08:24 messages.010912.gz

       and in ~/var/mail:

           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser       0 Sep 12 14:19 cron
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser      94 Sep 12 14:18 cron.010912.gz

   Solution Explanation
       Like the cases in our previous example, we create a simple
       configuration file that lists the logs we want to process. savelogs
       will go through each of its phases (by default, since we didn't specify
       any Process options, savelogs will execute the move and compress
       phases) and process each log in turn.

       If we were to store each log file in a tar archive using the Process
       directive set to all, we would have three different compressed tar
       files, one for each log.

Possible Solution 2: a single archive for all files
       Suppose we wanted these three files placed into a single archive so
       that we could download just one file periodically instead of many
       files.

   savelogs Configuration File
           ## ==== begin savelogs-2b.conf ==== ##

           ## our log file we want to rotate
           Log      /var/log/messages
           Log      /var/log/procmail
           Log      /var/mail/cron
           Touch    yes
           Process  all
           Archive  /var/log/logs.tar

           ## ===== end savelogs-2b.conf ===== ##

   Solution Results
       The resulting file in ~/var/log:

           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser   32413 Sep 12 17:16 logs.tar.gz

       contains our three original files:

           server% gtar -ztf logs.tar.gz
           messages.010912
           procmail.010912
           cron.010912

   Solution Explanation
       The primary strength of this solution is that files scattered about
       your file system are stored centrally, making downloading logs
       convenient.

       This solution has the same drawback, however, as the similar case in
       the previous example: the tar file must be decompressed before adding
       files to it. This solution is fine if you can guarantee that your total
       disk space is enough to handle all of the archived logs together in
       their decompressed sizes.

Possible Solution 3: a single archive for all files where path information is
       preserved
       We like our single archive, but what happens if we have two files with
       the same name (e.g., ~/var/log/cron and ~/var/mail/cron)?  gtar is able
       to put both files in the archive, but when we extract them one of them
       is going to overwrite the other. The solution is to store path
       information with our archives.  While most people who post-process
       their log files will probably not use this technique, if you're saving
       the logs "just in case", this solution will work well.

   savelogs Configuration File
           ## ==== begin savelogs-2c.conf ==== ##

           ## our log file we want to rotate
           Log        /var/log/messages
           Log        /var/log/procmail
           Log        /var/log/cron
           Log        /var/mail/cron
           Touch      yes
           Process    all
           Archive    /var/log/logs.tar
           Full-Path  yes

           ## ===== end savelogs-2c.conf ===== ##

       You can see that we have two files ~/var/log/cron and ~/var/mail/cron
       that will conflict inside our tar file unless we preserve path
       information.

   Solution Results
       The resulting file, like the previous case, is ~/var/log/logs.tar.gz:

           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser   32471 Sep 13 13:51 logs.tar.gz

       contains the for log files we included in our configuration file:

           server% tar -ztf logs.tar.gz
           var/log/messages.010913
           var/log/procmail.010913
           var/log/cron.010913
           var/mail/cron.010913

       except the archive contains full path information, allowing us to store
       two files with the same name (~/var/log/cron and ~/var/mail/cron).

   Solution Explanation
       This solution is well-suited for archiving scattered logs, some of
       which may have the same name. It is also ideal for preserving directory
       hierarchy information, as well as the actual log files themselves.
       While most people who actually perform some log analysis on these files
       may find that extracting the log files from the archive is cumbersome,
       the only other good alternative is to archive logs separately and
       download them separately.

Possible Solution 4: a single archive for each directory containing logs
       This solution is a hybrid of the last two solutions. We don't want to
       preserve path information in our archive, but we still wish to be able
       to store files with common names. This solution takes advantage of one
       of savelogs hidden features to allow us to create a single archive per-
       directory root.

   savelogs Configuration File
           ## ==== begin savelogs-2d.conf ==== ##

           ## our log file we want to rotate
           Log        /var/log/messages
           Log        /var/log/procmail
           Log        /var/log/cron
           Log        /var/mail/cron
           Touch      yes
           Process    all
           Archive    logs.tar

           ## ===== end savelogs-2d.conf ===== ##

       We have stripped the path from the Archive directive and no longer
       include the Full-Path directive.

   Solution Results
       After running savelogs with the above configuration file we have two
       archives, one in ~/var/log/logs.tar.gz:

           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser   32337 Sep 13 14:04 logs.tar.gz

       whose contents are:

           server% tar -ztf logs.tar.gz
           messages.010913
           procmail.010913
           cron.010913

       The other archive is ~/var/mail/logs.tar.gz:

           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser  182 Sep 13 14:04 logs.tar.gz

       whose contents are:

           server% tar -ztf logs.tar.gz
           cron.010913

   Solution Explanation
       This solution is like the previous except that instead of preserving
       path information to store files with the same name, it uses a separate
       archive for each directory root (e.g., ~/var/log and ~/var/mail).

EXAMPLE 3: ROTATING APACHE LOGS
       Everyone, sooner or later, has to rotate Apache log files. savelogs has
       a number of options to help make Apache log rotation as simple and
       efficient as possible. To accomplish this, we introduce three new
       directives: apacheconf, apachelog, and apachelogexclude.

       Suppose we have all of our system log rotation under control. Now we
       have some Apache log files that are consistently eating up our disk
       space and we want to somehow keep the amount of disk space used by
       files to a minimum. Our first instinct is to add a Log directive to our
       savelogs configuration file for each log that we want to process. But
       after adding a few, we realize that there must be a better way to do
       this.

Possible Solution 1: Automatic Logfile Detection
       savelogs is Apache-aware. That is, it knows how to read Apache style
       configuration files and look for certain patterns. These patterns are
       treated as filenames of log files to process. If the ApacheConf
       directive is specified, savelogs will read the specified Apache
       configuration file and parse it for log files. Each log file found will
       be processed as if it had been specified with the Log directive or
       passed on the command-line.

       Assume our Apache configuration file has the following directives:

           TransferLog "|/usr/local/bin/logwatch /usr/local/etc/httpd/logs/access_log"
           ErrorLog "|/usr/local/bin/logwatch /usr/local/etc/httpd/logs/error_log"

           <VirtualHost domain.name1 www.domain.name1>
             ServerAdmin webmaster@domain.name1
             DocumentRoot /usr/local/etc/httpd/vhosts/domain.name1
             ServerName www.domain.name1
             ErrorLog logs/error_log-domain.name1
             TransferLog logs/access_log-domain.name1
           </VirtualHost>

           <VirtualHost domain.name2 www.domain.name2>
             ServerAdmin webmaster@domain.name2
             DocumentRoot /usr/local/etc/httpd/vhosts/domain.name2
             ServerName www.domain.name2
             ErrorLog logs/error_log-domain.name2
             TransferLog /dev/null
           </VirtualHost>

           <VirtualHost domain.name3 www.domain.name3>
             ServerAdmin webmaster@domain.name3
             DocumentRoot /usr/local/etc/httpd/vhosts/domain.name3
             ServerName www.domain.name3
             ErrorLog logs/error_log-domain.name3
             TransferLog logs/access_log-domain.name3
           </VirtualHost>

       We have the main server TransferLog and ErrorLog directives and each of
       the three virtual hosts have their own TransferLog and ErrorLog
       directives also.

   savelogs Configuration File

           ## ===== end savelogs-3a.conf ===== ##

   Solution Results
       After running savelogs with the above configuration file, we'll have in
       our logs directory the following files:

           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser        0 Sep 13 23:07 access_log-domain.name1
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser     9360 Sep 13 23:06 access_log-domain.name1.010913.gz

           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser      859 Sep 13 23:06 error_log-domain.name1.010913.gz
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser        0 Sep 13 23:07 error_log-domain.name2
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser      352 Sep 13 23:06 error_log-domain.name2.010913.gz
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser        0 Sep 13 23:07 error_log-domain.name3
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser      661 Sep 13 23:06 error_log-domain.name3.010913.gz

   Solution Explanation
       When savelogs sees the ApacheConf directive, it reads the given Apache
       configuration file, looking for directives that might be log files.
       savelogs decides what Apache configuration directives might be log
       files with the ApacheLog directive, which defaults to:

           TransferLog|ErrorLog|AgentLog|RefererLog|CustomLog

       After finding all of the Apache lines that match the above pattern,
       lines that also match the ApacheLogExclude pattern are removed from the
       list. The savelogs default ApacheLogExclude pattern is:

           ^/dev/null$|\|

       (read "/dev/null OR a pipe character").

       Notice that our second virtual host logs its transfer log to /dev/null.
       savelogs recognizes this and skips that log since trying to rotate
       /dev/null demonstrates poor taste. Also, our main server log files are
       piped through a program first:

           TransferLog "|/usr/local/bin/logwatch /usr/local/etc/httpd/logs/access_log"
           ErrorLog "|/usr/local/bin/logwatch /usr/local/etc/httpd/logs/error_log"

       savelogs detects the pipe character and does not attempt to rotate
       these logs either. To rotate these logs, you could add them with the
       Log directive to the savelogs configuration file or on the command-
       line.

Possible Solution 2: Automatic Logfile Detection with Exceptions
       We like what savelogs did for us in the last solution, but we have an
       exception to make. We have this one virtual host that insists on doing
       their own log files. We want to leave their logs alone. What to do?

   savelogs Configuration File
           ## ==== begin savelogs-3b.conf ==== ##

           ApacheConf  /www/conf/httpd.conf
           NoLog       /usr/local/etc/httpd/logs/*_log-domain.name3
           PostMoveHook /usr/local/bin/restart_apache

           ## ===== end savelogs-3b.conf ===== ##

   Solution Results
       After running savelogs with the above configuration file, we'll have in
       our logs directory the following files:

           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser        0 Sep 13 23:07 access_log-domain.name1
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser     9360 Sep 13 23:06 access_log-domain.name1.010913.gz
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser     1040 Sep 13 23:06 access_log-domain.name3
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser        0 Sep 13 23:07 error_log-domain.name1
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser      859 Sep 13 23:06 error_log-domain.name1.010913.gz
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser        0 Sep 13 23:07 error_log-domain.name2
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser      352 Sep 13 23:06 error_log-domain.name2.010913.gz
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser      661 Sep 13 23:06 error_log-domain.name3

   Solution Explanation
       The NoLog directive tells savelogs to skip files that match the
       pattern. We supplied '*_log-domain.name3' as our pattern. The asterisk
       follows standard shell globbing conventions (yikes! that just means
       that savelogs patterns will work just like they do from your UNIX shell
       command prompt). In this case, our pattern expanded to
       access_log-domain.name3 and error_log-domain.name3, so these files were
       removed from the list of files to process that the ApacheConf directive
       made for us. NoLog is new with savelogs version 1.40.

Possible Solution 3: Log File Analysis Embedding
       Many log file analysis programs require a static and consistenly-named
       log file. This means that the log file must not be in use by Apache
       (i.e., Apache is not logging to it) and the name of the log file must
       not vary from day to day (i.e., many log analysis programs require you
       to enter the name of the log file in a static configuration file).

       These two requirements are often at odds with the objectives of log
       file rotation programs. The object of a log rotation system is to
       reduce disk space use while preserving data. An additional objective is
       to locate a log quickly for a particular day. savelogs' default
       behavior is to rename a log to include today's date in the filename and
       then compressing the file, achieving all three goals.

       In order to allow log file analysis programs the ability to have their
       cake and eat it too, without letting the log file analysis program
       rotate your logs for you (often crude and clumsy) and without forcing
       you to write complicated cron jobs to run, savelogs introduces
       stemming.

       Stemming is simply a fancy way of saying "makes a link to the freshly
       renamed log file". This link has the same name every day (or however
       often you invoke savelogs) which lets you use the stem name in your log
       file analysis program. The link points to a new log each day, however,
       which means that your log file analysis program will always be reading
       current information.

   savelogs Configuration File
       You may recall that our main access_log and error_log files are piped
       through separate processes in the Apache configuration file, so they
       won't be found by savelogs's ApacheConf directive. We use the Log
       directive twice here to add them explicitly:

           ## ==== begin savelogs-3c.conf ==== ##

           ApacheConf   /www/conf/httpd.conf
           Log          /www/logs/access_log
           Log          /www/logs/error_log

           PostMoveHook /usr/local/bin/restart_apache

           StemHook     $HOME/usr/local/urchin/urchin

           ## ===== end savelogs-3c.conf ===== ##

       for Analog, our StemHook line would look like this:

           StemHook     /usr/local/bin/virtual /usr/local/analog/analog

   Solution Results
       As before, our logs have been tidily rotated. Before they were
       completely rotated, however, Urchin ran and processed them.

           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser   225964 Sep 13 18:38 error_log.010913.gz

   Solution Explanation
       The StemHook directive works like this. We begin with a log file:

           -rw-r--r--  1 server vuser  6348250 Sep 13 18:41 access_log

       When savelogs starts up with something like this:

           % savelogs --postmovehook=/usr/local/bin/restart_apache \
                      --stemhook=\$HOME/usr/local/urchin/urchin \
                      /www/logs/access_log

       it first detects /www/logs/access_log and renames it:

           -rw-r--r--  1 server vuser  6348250 Sep 13 18:41 access_log.010913

       Any PostMoveHook commands are executed at this time. In this example we
       restart Apache so that Apache will close its file descriptors on
       /www/logs/access_log.010913 and re-open a new descriptor on
       /www/logs/access_log. Renaming (moving) a file will not necessarily
       close descriptors that other processes may have open on that file.

       savelogs then notices that we've supplied a StemHook, so it enters its
       stem phase. The first thing that savelogs does in the stem phase is
       create a symbolic link to the recently renamed file. The name of the
       symbolic link (by default) is the name of the log concatenated with the
       string 'today'. You can change the string with the Stem option.

       Now we have something like this:

           -rw-r--r--  1 server vuser  6348250 Sep 13 18:41 access_log.010913
           lrwxr-xr-x  1 server vuser       17 Sep 13 18:42 access_log.today -> access_log.010913

       savelogs next executes the command specified in the StemHook directive,
       in our case above it will run $HOME/usr/local/urchin/urchin.  The $HOME
       variable is a savelogs internal variable that corresponds to your home
       directory. Urchin should be configured something like this:

           #RestartCommand:     /usr/local/bin/restart_apache
           #LogDestiny:         archive

           ...

           <Report>
             ReportName:      server.com
             ReportDirectory: /usr/home/server/usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs/urchin/server.com/
             TransferLog:     /usr/home/server/usr/local/etc/httpd/logs/access_log.today
             ErrorLog:        /usr/home/server/usr/local/etc/httpd/logs/error_log.today
           </Report>

       Notice that we commented out the 'restart_apache' command for Urchin.
       Because we already renamed the log file and restarted Apache in the
       move phase, we don't need to do it again. Further, we have commented
       out Urchin's 'LogDestiny' command: we don't want Urchin rotating our
       logs or deleting our logs for us, thank you.

       The Urchin report section has been modified to look for our Stem files.
       After the StemHook has run, savelogs removes the links it created and
       continues on through its other phases as usual.

       The corresponding Analog configuration file would include this line
       (other virtual host lines would follow this pattern):

           LOGFILE /www/logs/access_log.today

       By the end of the compression phase, we have this:

           -rw-r--r--  1 server vuser   274755 Sep 13 18:41 access_log.010913.gz

       It may be that some command you issue in StemHook will not be able to
       read a symbolic link. If this is the case, you should specify the
       StemLink directive with another parameter:

       hard
           Creates a hard link to the file. This new file is indistinguishable
           from the original file. Any changes made to this new file will be
           reflected in the original file. This method requires no extra disk
           space.

       copy
           Creates a copy of the original file. Any changes made to this new
           file will NOT be reflected in the original file. Changes will be
           completely discarded after the StemHook phase has completed and the
           copy is deleted. This method requires as much extra disk space as
           the size of the original log.

       The rule of thumb is to use a hard link when the default symbolic link
       doesn't work (which is rare) and use a copy of the file if your
       StemHook command makes changes to the file which you don't want to
       preserve.

Possible Solution 4: Rotate Logs for VirtualHost
       As of version 1.80, you may specify a hostname for a VirtualHost block.
       savelogs will look for any VirtualHost blocks in the Apache
       configuration file that match the names you specify and process any
       logs found.

   savelogs Configuration File
           ## ==== begin savelogs-3d.conf ==== ##

           ApacheHost  www.domain.name3
           PostMoveHook /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl restart

           ## ===== end savelogs-3d.conf ===== ##

   Solution Results
       After running savelogs with the above configuration file, we'll have
       the following changes:

           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser        0 Sep 13 23:07 access_log-domain.name1
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser     9360 Sep 13 23:06 access_log-domain.name1.010913.gz
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser        0 Sep 13 23:07 access_log-domain.name3
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser     1040 Sep 13 23:06 access_log-domain.name3.010913.gz
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser        0 Sep 13 23:07 error_log-domain.name1
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser      859 Sep 13 23:06 error_log-domain.name1.010913.gz
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser     3442 Sep 13 23:07 error_log-domain.name2
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser        0 Sep 13 23:07 error_log-domain.name3
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser      661 Sep 13 23:06 error_log-domain.name3.010913.gz

       Notice that no changes were made to error_log-domain.name2 since it
       wasn't specified in the savelogs configuration file.

   Solution Explanation
       The new ApacheHost directive tells savelogs to only process log files
       for Apache VirtualHost blocks whose ServerName directive matches one of
       the specified host names. The ApacheHost directive may be given
       multiple times to process multiple hosts.

EXAMPLE 4: Filtering logs
       We do not have root.exe or cmd.exe on our web server and we never will
       if we have any say in matters.

       Nevertheless, we grow weary of our Apache log files growing out of
       control mostly due to requests for these files from a slew of new
       Windows IIS worms. When we process our logs with our favorite log file
       analysis tool, we want to get rid of these kinds of entries before our
       log file analysis tool ever gets the log. What to do?

Possible Solution 1: Filtering with savelogs
       We can strip these bogus requests from our log files before they are
       processed. Each night we'll run our logs through a filter that will
       make them clean and free of any Windows worm requests.

   savelogs Configuration File
           ## ==== begin savelogs-4a.conf

           ApacheConf     /www/conf/httpd.conf
           PostMoveHook   /usr/local/bin/restart_apache
           Filter         /usr/bin/egrep -v '(root|cmd)\.exe' $LOG

           ## ==== end savelogs-4a.conf

   Solution Results
       When we started, our logs looked like this:

           server:~ $ ls -l
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser  278115 Jan  7 10:25 access_log
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser   34989 Jan  7 00:10 error_log

       If we could sneak a peek at the logs after they had been renamed and
       filtered, they'd look like this:

           server:~ $ ls -l
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser  260882 Jan  7 11:00 access_log.020107
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser   18838 Jan  7 11:00 error_log.020107

       You can see that we stripped out 18k from the access_log and about 16k
       from the error_log. After the entire process is complete, our logs look
       like this:

           server:~ $ ls -l
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser  26807 Jan  7 11:00 access_log.020107.gz
           -rw-r--r--  1 server  vuser   2247 Jan  7 11:00 error_log.020107.gz

   Solution Explanation
       We use the ApacheConf directive to tell savelogs which logs to process.
       savelogs searches the file specified in ApacheConf for log files. The
       PostMoveHook directive restarts our Apache daemon after the logs have
       been renamed. We do this so that Apache closes and reopens its log
       files on a new log file (and stops trying to log to the recently
       renamed logs). Lastly we use the Filter directive to remove lines with
       the strings 'root.exe' or 'cmd.exe' from the log.

       The Filter directive should be a program that alters the log files in
       some way. The output of the Filter command is saved to a temporary file
       which later replaces the log file itself, so be careful how you filter.

       In this specific example, we pipe our log file through egrep(1); the -v
       option tells egrep to exclude lines that match the pattern.  $LOG is a
       special savelogs variable (see the savelogs(1) manpage) that refers to
       the log currently being processed.

SUMMARY
       We have presented a few important examples which illustrate the
       abilities of the savelogs program. No tutorial is complete without
       reading the original manual. Please see savelogs(1) if this tutorial
       has left you with unanswered questions.

CAVEATS
       If you're careless you might accidentally delete logs or move logs
       somewhere you didn't want to. Make sure you run savelogs with the dry-
       run option enabled whenever you do experimenting, especially if the log
       data might be remotely useful.

       You are also encouraged to keep a log of savelogs actions. See the
       LogLevel and LogFile directives in the savelogs(1) manual.
