EZSTREAM-FILE.SH(1)     FreeBSD General Commands Manual    EZSTREAM-FILE.SH(1)

NAME
     ezstream-file.sh – script to stream files from the command line

SYNOPSIS
     ezstream-file.sh [-hnqVv] [-T cfg_template] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The ezstream-file.sh script uses an ezstream configuration file template
     to stream a list of files given on the command line, or via standard
     input.  In other words, filenames are written to a temporary playlist,
     and a template-based configuration is generated to stream them.

     The path to a configuration template must be provided, either by using
     the -T command line argument, or the EZSTREAM_TEMPLATE environment
     variable.

     The configuration template must be a valid playlist configuration, and
     contain the follwing configuration statement:

           <filename>%FILENAME%</filename>

     If no input files are specified, the list of files to be streamed are
     read from standard input.

     Lastly, the EZSTREAM environment variable allows to specify an alternate
     ezstream binary.

   Command line parameters
     -h      Print a summary of available command line parameters with short
             descriptions and exit.

     -n      (Passed to ezstream.) Normalize metadata strings by removing
             excess whitespaces.

     -q      (Passed to ezstream.) Be more quiet.  Suppress the output that
             external programs send to standard error.

     -T cfg_template
             Use the configuration in cfg_template, overriding the default set
             in the EZSTREAM_TEMPLATE environment variable.

     -V      Print the ezstream-file.sh version number and exit.

     -v      (Passed to ezstream.) Produce more verbose output from ezstream.
             Use twice for even more verbose output.

FILES
     /usr/local/share/examples/ezstream  Directory containing example
                                         configuration files for various uses
                                         of ezstream, as well as example
                                         playlist and metadata scripts.
