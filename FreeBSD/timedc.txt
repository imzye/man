TIMEDC(8)               FreeBSD System Manager's Manual              TIMEDC(8)

NAME
     timedc – timed control program

SYNOPSIS
     timedc [command [argument ...]]

DESCRIPTION
     The timedc utility is used to control the operation of the timed(8)
     program.  It may be used to:

     •   Measure the differences between machines' clocks,

     •   Find the location where the master time server is running,

     •   Enable or disable tracing of messages received by timed(8), and

     •   Perform various debugging actions.

     Without any arguments, timedc will prompt for commands from the standard
     input.  If arguments are supplied, timedc interprets the first argument
     as a command and the remaining arguments as parameters to the command.
     The standard input may be redirected causing timedc to read commands from
     a file.  Commands may be abbreviated; recognized commands are:

     ? [command ...]

     help [command ...]
             Print a short description of each command specified in the
             argument list, or, if no arguments are given, a list of the
             recognized commands.

     clockdiff host ...
             Compute the differences between the clock of the host machine and
             the clocks of the machines given as arguments.

     msite [host ...]
             Show the master time server for specified host(s).

     trace { on | off }
             Enable or disable the tracing of incoming messages to timed(8) in
             the file /var/log/timed.log.

     election host1 [host2 ...]
             Asks the daemon on the target host to reset its "election" timers
             and to ensure that a time master has been elected.

     quit    Exit from timedc.

     Other commands may be included for use in testing and debugging timed(8);
     the help command and the program source may be consulted for details.

FILES
     /var/log/timed.log        tracing file for timed
     /var/log/timed.masterlog  log file for master timed

DIAGNOSTICS

     ?Invalid command  no match found

     ?Privileged command  command can be executed by root only

HISTORY
     The timedc utility appeared in 4.3BSD.

     The latest timedc code has been made available as a port (net/timed) in
     preparation of removal from base in FreeBSD 13.0.
