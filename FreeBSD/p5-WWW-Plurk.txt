NAME
       WWW::Plurk - Unoffical plurk.com API

VERSION
       This document describes WWW::Plurk version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
           use WWW::Plurk;
           my $plurk = WWW::Plurk->new;
           $plurk->login( 'username', 'password' );
           my $msg = $plurk->add_plurk( content => 'Hello, World' );

DESCRIPTION
       This is an unofficial API for plurk.com. It uses the same interfaces
       that plurk itself uses internally which are not published and not
       necessarily stable. When Plurk publish a stable API this module will be
       updated to take advantage of it. In the mean time use with caution.

       Ryan Lim did the heavy lifting of reverse engineering the API. His PHP
       implementation can be found at <http://code.google.com/p/rlplurkapi/>.

       If you'd like to lend a hand supporting the bits of Plurk that this API
       doesn't yet reach please feel free to send me a patch. The Plurk API
       Wiki at <http://plurkwiki.badchemicals.net/> is a good source of
       information.

INTERFACE
       All methods throw errors in the event of any kind of failure. There's
       no need to check return values but you might want to wrap calls in an
       "eval" block.

   "new"
       Create a new "WWW::Plurk". Optionally accepts two arguments (username,
       password). If they are supplied it will attempt to login to Plurk. If
       no arguments are supplied "login" must be called before attempting to
       access the service.

           # Create and login
           my $plurk = WWW::Plurk->new( 'user', 'pass' );

           # Create then login afterwards
           my $plurk = WWW::Plurk->new;
           $plurk->login( 'user', 'pass' );

   "login"
       Attempt to login to a Plurk account. The two mandatory arguments are
       the username and password for the account to be accessed.

           my $plurk = WWW::Plurk->new;
           $plurk->login( 'user', 'pass' );

   "is_logged_in"
       Returns a true value if we're currently logged in.

           if ( $plurk->is_logged_in ) {
               $plurk->add_plurk( content => 'w00t!' );
           }

   "friends_for"
       Return a user's friends.

           my @friends = $plurk->friends_for( $uid );

       Pass the user id as either

       •   an integer

               my @friends = $plurk->friends_for( 12345 );

       •   an object that has a method called "uid"

               # $some_user isa WWW::Plurk::Friend
               my @friends = $plurk->friends_for( $some_user );

       Returns a list of WWW::Plurk::Friend objects.

   "friends"
       Return the current user's friends. This

           my @friends = $plurk->friends;

       is equivalent to

           my @friends = $plurk->friends_for( $self->uid );

   "add_plurk"
       Post a new plurk.

           $plurk->add_plurk(
               content => 'Hello, World'
           );

       Arguments are supplied as a number of key, value pairs. The following
       arguments are recognised:

       •   content - the message content

       •   qualifier - the qualifier string ('is', 'says' etc)

       •   lang - the (human) language for this Plurk

       •   no_comments - true to disallow comments

       •   limited_to - limit visibility

       The only mandatory argument is "content" which should be a string of
       140 characters or fewer.

       "qualifier" is first word of the message - which has special
       significance that you will understand if you have looked at the Plurk
       web interface. The following qualifiers are supported:

         asks feels gives has hates is likes loves
         says shares thinks wants was will wishes

       If omitted "qualifier" defaults to ':' which signifies that you are
       posting a free-form message with no qualifier.

       "lang" is the human language for this Plurk. It defaults to 'en'.
       Apologies to those posting in languages other than English.

       "no_comments" should be true to lock the Plurk preventing comments from
       being made.

       "limited_to" is an array of user ids (or objects with a method called
       "uid"). If present the Plurk will only be visible to those users. To
       limit visibility of a Plurk to friends use:

           my $msg = $plurk->add_plurk(
               content => 'Hi chums',
               limited_to => [ $plurk->friends ]
           );

       Returns a WWW::Plurk::Message representing the new Plurk.

   "plurks"
       Get a list of recent Plurks for the logged in user. Returns an array of
       WWW::Plurk::Message objects.

           my @plurks = $plurk->plurks;

       Any arguments must be passed as key => value pairs. The following
       optional arguments are recognised:

       •   uid - the user whose messages we want

       •   date_from - the start date for retrieved messages

       •   date_offset - er, not sure what this does :)

       As you may infer from the explanation of "date_offset", I'm not
       entirely sure how this interface works. I cargo-culted the options from
       the PHP version. If anyone can explain "date_offset" please let me know
       and I'll update the documentation.

   "unread_plurks"
       Return a list of unread Plurks for the current user.

   "responses_for"
       Get the responses for a Plurk. Returns a list of WWW::Plurk::Message
       objects. Accepts a single argument which is the numeric ID of the Plurk
       whose responses we want.

           my @responses = $plurk->responses_for( $msg->plurk_id );

   "respond_to_plurk"
       Post a response to an existing Plurk. The first argument must be the ID
       of the Plurk to respond to. Additional arguments are supplied as a
       number of key => value pairs. The following arguments are recognised:

       •   content - the message content

       •   qualifier - the qualifier string ('is', 'says' etc)

       •   lang - the (human) language for this Plurk

       See "add_plurk" for details of how these arguments are interpreted.

           my $responce = $plurk->respond_to_plurk(
               $plurk_id,
               content => 'Nice!'
           );

       Returns an WWW::Plurk::Message representing the newly posted response.

   Accessors
       The following accessors are available:

       •   "info" - the user info hash

       •   "state" - the state of this object (init or login)

       •   "trace" - set true to enable HTTP query tracing

       •   "display_name" - the user's display name

       •   "full_name" - the user's full name

       •   "gender" - the user's gender
