NAME
       WMMOONCLOCK - Dockable Moon Phase Clock

SYNOPSIS
       wmMoonClock [-display <Display>] [-bc <Color>] [-lc <Color>] [-dc
       <Color>] [-low] [-lat <Latitude>] [-lon <Longitude>] [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       wmMoonClock displays the current phase of the moon. Clicking on the
       icon brings up different displays -- there are 5 in all. The different
       "pages" are;


       First Page
              Shows the Moon phase image.

       Second Page
              Shows the current Local Time (LT) and Universal Time (UT), the
              Moon's Age (number of days since last new moon), the geometric
              (as opposed to temporal) fraction of the way through the current
              lunar cyle (e.g. 50 for full moon), the fraction of the Moon's
              disc that is illuminated (ratio of area illuminated to total
              area of disc) and whether the Moon is (locally) visible of not
              (i.e. is it above the horizon?).

       Third Page
              Shows the Rise and Set times for yesterday (first line), today
              (middle line), and tommorrow (last line). If the Moon does not
              rise or set on a given day a `null time' is shown (--:--). Note
              that these times should still be good for high latitude
              observers. Also note that there will always be at least one
              (--:--) showing up per month. This is because once per month the
              Moon will rise (set) on a given day but will set (rise) in the
              very early portion of the next day.

       Fourth Page
              Shows the Moon's horizon coordinates (i.e. the Altitude/Azimuth
              system). Azimuth is measured in degrees CCW from due south, and
              altitude is measured in degrees from the horizon up to the Moon.
              Distance (Dist) is measured in units on Earth radii (1 Re is
              about 6370km). Note that this is a local coordinate system and
              will not be correct if the observer's latitude and longitude are
              not set correctly.

       Fifth Page
              Shows the Moon's ecliptic coordinates. (i.e. the Right
              Ascention/Declination system).  Useful for astronomers?

       Many of the quantities shown will not be correct unless LT and UT are
       correct, and the user specifies the proper latitude and longitude.

OPTIONS
       -display <display>
              Use an alternate X Display.

       -bc    Set background color. (E.g. #7e9e69 or blue)

       -lc    Set color of text labels.

       -dc    Set color of data values.

       -low   Conserve colors. For 8-bit displays, a lower-color pixmap will
              be used automatically, but you can also force its use on
              higher-color displays if necessary.

       -lat <Latitude>
              Observers Latitude in degrees. Positive in northern hemisphere,
              negative in southern hemisphere.

       -lon <Longitude>
              Observers Longitude in degrees. Greenwich is 0.0, and longitude
              increases positively toward the west. (Alternatively, negative
              numbers can also be used to specify longitudes to the east of
              Greenwich).

       -h     Display list of command-line options.

BUGS
       Who knows? (Let me know if you find any).
