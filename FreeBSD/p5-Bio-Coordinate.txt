NAME
       Bio::Coordinate - Modules for working with biological coordinates

VERSION
       version 1.007001

SYNOPSIS
         # create Bio::Coordinate::Pairs or other Bio::Coordinate::MapperIs somehow
         $pair1; $pair2;

         # add them into a Collection
         $collection = Bio::Coordinate::Collection->new;
         $collection->add_mapper($pair1);
         $collection->add_mapper($pair2);

         # create a position and map it
         $pos = Bio::Location::Simple->new (-start => 5, -end => 9 );
         $res = $collection->map($pos);
         $res->match->start == 1;
         $res->match->end == 5;

         # if mapping is many to one (*>1) or many-to-many (*>*)
         # you have to give seq_id not get unrelevant entries
         $pos = Bio::Location::Simple->new
             (-start => 5, -end => 9 -seq_id=>'clone1');

DESCRIPTION
       Bio::Coordinate classes are used for working with various biological
       coordinate systems.  See Bio::Coordinate::Collection and
       Bio::Collection::Pair for examples.
