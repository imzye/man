NAME
       CartConvert -- convert geodetic coordinates to geocentric or local
       cartesian

SYNOPSIS
       CartConvert [ -r ] [ -l lat0 lon0 h0 ] [ -e a f ] [ -w ] [ -p prec ] [
       --comment-delimiter commentdelim ] [ --version | -h | --help ] [
       --input-file infile | --input-string instring ] [ --line-separator
       linesep ] [ --output-file outfile ]

DESCRIPTION
       Convert geodetic coordinates to either geocentric or local cartesian
       coordinates.  Geocentric coordinates have the origin at the center of
       the earth, with the z axis going thru the north pole, and the x axis
       thru latitude = 0, longitude = 0.  By default, the conversion is to
       geocentric coordinates.  Specifying -l lat0 lon0 h0 causes a local
       coordinate system to be used with the origin at latitude = lat0,
       longitude = lon0, height = h0, z normal to the ellipsoid and y due
       north.

       Geodetic coordinates are provided on standard input as a set of lines
       containing (blank separated) latitude, longitude (decimal degrees or
       degrees, minutes and seconds), and height above the ellipsoid (meters);
       for details on the allowed formats for latitude and longitude, see the
       "GEOGRAPHIC COORDINATES" section of GeoConvert(1).  For each set of
       geodetic coordinates, the corresponding cartesian coordinates x, y, z
       (meters) are printed on standard output.

OPTIONS
       -r  perform the reverse projection.  x, y, z are given on standard
           input and each line of standard output gives latitude, longitude,
           height.  In general there are multiple solutions and the result
           which minimizes the absolute value of height is returned, i.e.,
           (latitude, longitude) corresponds to the closest point on the
           ellipsoid.

       -l lat0 lon0 h0
           specifies conversions to and from a local cartesion coordinate
           systems with origin lat0 lon0 h0, instead of a geocentric
           coordinate system.  The -w flag can be used to swap the default
           order of the 2 geographic coordinates, provided that it appears
           before -l.

       -e a f
           specify the ellipsoid via the equatorial radius, a and the
           flattening, f.  Setting f = 0 results in a sphere.  Specify f < 0
           for a prolate ellipsoid.  A simple fraction, e.g., 1/297, is
           allowed for f.  By default, the WGS84 ellipsoid is used, a =
           6378137 m, f = 1/298.257223563.

       -w  toggle the longitude first flag (it starts off); if the flag is on,
           then on input and output, longitude precedes latitude (except that,
           on input, this can be overridden by a hemisphere designator, N, S,
           E, W).

       -p prec
           set the output precision to prec (default 6).  prec is the number
           of digits after the decimal point for geocentric and local
           cartesion coordinates and for the height (in meters).  For
           latitudes and longitudes (in degrees), the number of digits after
           the decimal point is prec + 5.

       --comment-delimiter commentdelim
           set the comment delimiter to commentdelim (e.g., "#" or "//").  If
           set, the input lines will be scanned for this delimiter and, if
           found, the delimiter and the rest of the line will be removed prior
           to processing and subsequently appended to the output line
           (separated by a space).

       --version
           print version and exit.

       -h  print usage and exit.

       --help
           print full documentation and exit.

       --input-file infile
           read input from the file infile instead of from standard input; a
           file name of "-" stands for standard input.

       --input-string instring
           read input from the string instring instead of from standard input.
           All occurrences of the line separator character (default is a
           semicolon) in instring are converted to newlines before the reading
           begins.

       --line-separator linesep
           set the line separator character to linesep.  By default this is a
           semicolon.

       --output-file outfile
           write output to the file outfile instead of to standard output; a
           file name of "-" stands for standard output.

EXAMPLES
          echo 33.3 44.4 6000 | CartConvert
          => 3816209.60 3737108.55 3485109.57
          echo 33.3 44.4 6000 | CartConvert -l 33 44 20
          => 37288.97 33374.29 5783.64
          echo 30000 30000 0 | CartConvert -r
          => 6.483 45 -6335709.73

ERRORS
       An illegal line of input will print an error message to standard output
       beginning with "ERROR:" and causes CartConvert to return an exit code
       of 1.  However, an error does not cause CartConvert to terminate;
       following lines will be converted.
