NAME
     ipwfw – Firmware Module for Intel PRO/Wireless 2100 driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this module into the kernel, place the following line in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device ipwfw

     This will include three firmware images inside the kernel.  If you want
     to pick only the firmware image for the mode you want to operate your
     network adapter in choose one of the following:

           device ipwbssfw
           device ipwibssfw
           device ipwmonitorfw

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following lines in loader.conf(5):

           ipw_bss_load="YES"
           ipw_ibss_load="YES"
           ipw_monitor_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     This module provides access to firmware sets for the Intel PRO/Wireless
     2100 series of IEEE 802.11 adapters.  It may be statically linked into
     the kernel, or loaded as a module.

     For the loaded firmware to be enabled for use the license at
     /usr/share/doc/legal/intel_ipw.LICENSE must be agreed to by adding the
     following line to loader.conf(5):

           legal.intel_ipw.license_ack=1
