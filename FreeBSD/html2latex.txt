HTML2LATEX(1)           FreeBSD General Commands Manual          HTML2LATEX(1)

NAME
     html2latex – convert HTML markup to LaTeX markup

SYNOPSIS
     html2latex [opt] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     For each file argument, html2latex converts the text as HTML markup to
     LaTeX markup.  If no files are specified, a usage message is given.
     Input will be taken from standard input for files named -.  Output will
     to a similarly named file with a ‘.tex’ extension ( html2latex recognises
     ‘.html’ extensions).

     Options modify the action of html2latex.

     The options are:

           -n   Number sections.

           -p   Place page breaks after the title page (if present) and the
                table of contents (if present).

           -c   Generate a table of contents.

           -s   Create no files -- LaTeX is output to stdout.

           -t Title
                Generate a title page, with the title Title.

           -a Author
                Generate a title page, with the author Author.

           -h Header
                Place the text Header after ‘\begin{document}’.

           -f Footer
                Place the text Footer before ‘\end{document}’.

           -o Options
                Specify the options to ‘\documentstyle’.

EXAMPLES
     An example of use is

           html2latex -n - < file.html | less

     This converts file.html to LaTeX and pages through the output.  The
     sections (corresponding to heading tags in the HTML source) will be
     numbered.

     Another example is

           html2latex -t 'Introduction to HTML' -a gnat \
           -p -c -o '[bookman]{article}' html-intro

     This takes input from the file html-intro, writing to html-intro.tex, and
     adds a title page (with title Introduction to HTML and author gnat) and
     table of contents with page-breaks after both.  The sections of the
     document are not numbered.  The LaTeX source includes the line
     ‘\documentstyle[bookman]{article}’.

BUGS
     Current the only HTML tags supported are: TITLE, H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6,
     UL, OL, DL, DT, DD, LI, B, I, U, EM, STRONG, CODE, SAMP, KBD, VAR, DFN,
     CITE, LISTING.  The only recognised SGML escapes are ‘&amp.amp’,
     ‘&amp.lt’, ‘&amp.gt’.  ADDRESS tags are handled badly.

     The COMPACT attribute to a DL tag is not recognised.  MENU and DIR styles
     are not handled well.  TITLE text are ignored.

     Currently PRE tags are not handled at all.

     The entire file is read into memory.  For long HTML documents on machines
     with little memory, this may cause problems.
