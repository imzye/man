DESCRIPTION
       Tilda is a terminal emulator which is highly configurable. The main
       distinguishing feature of tilda is that it uses a configurable shortcut
       to show and hide the tilda window. This allows users to quickly switch
       between tilda and other windows only through keyboard shortcuts. When
       tilda is hidden it will move outside of the screen until the
       pull/toggle shortcut is pressed again to show the tilda window. The
       behaviour of tilda can be configured using the preferences dialog that
       is available via the context menu. A subset of the options can also be
       configured from the command line as documented below.

       Please note that currently command line options override the settings
       in the configuration file and are persisted into the configuration
       file.

       On Xorg-based desktops, Tilda is using an X11 filter function to
       register its hotkeys. On Wayland, this method only works while other
       X11-based programs are active but we cannot send hotkeys to tilda while
       native Wayland applications have the focus. Therefore, on Wayland
       desktops tilda needs to be started with D-Bus support (i.e., with
       --dbus) and a global shortcut key must be registered using the desktop
       environment settings to send a D-Bus action to show or hide the Tilda
       window.

OPTIONS
   Help Options:
       -?, --help
              Show help options

       --help-all
              Show all help options, including D-Bus and GTK options.

   Application Options:
       -b, --background-color color
              Set the background color. The value can be either a standard
              color name from X11 or a hexadecimal value (i.e., #rgb, #rrggbb,
              etc.).

       -c, --command command
              Run a command at startup instead of the default shell.

       -h, --hidden
              Start Tilda hidden.

       -f, --font font
              Set the font to the Pango FontDescription specified in font.
              Defaults to "Monospace 11".

       -l, --lines lines
              The the scrollback buffer size to a maximum of lines.

       -s, --scrollbar
              Show a scrollbar at the side of the terminal.

       -v, --version
              Print the version, then exit.

       -w, --working-dir dir
              Set initial working directory to dir.

       -x, --x-pos x_pos
              Set the X position of the tilda terminal window to x_pos.

       -y, --y-pos y_pos
              Set the Y position of the tilda terminal window to y_pos.

       -t, --background-alpha alpha
              Set the terminal windows transparency to alpha (i.e., 0-100%).
              Higher values increase the level of transparency.

       -C, --config
              Show the configuration wizard.

       --display=DISPLAY
              Set the X display to use (i.e., :0, :0.0, etc.).

   D-Bus Options:
       --dbus Enables D-Bus support (see D-Bus).

       -T, --toggle-window [instance_id]
              Toggle a Tilda window with instance_id and exit. If instance_id
              is not specified it will default to instance 0. This option
              provides a convenient way to toggle tilda windows on Wayland
              environments and is equivalent to the longer dbus-send command
              documented below. It can be used to setup a Keyboard shortcut on
              a Wayland-based desktop environment which will then toggle the
              Tilda window. Note, that this option is affected by the "Non-
              Focus Pull Up Behaviour" setting.

NOTES
   D-Bus
       If D-Bus is enabled, then Tilda offers a method on D-Bus to toggle the
       Tilda Window.  Each Tilda process registers its own D-Bus name, so it
       is possible to run multiple tilda processes each with their own config
       file and control them separately via D-Bus. When D-Bus is enabled, then
       the pull down shortcut is not registered as an Xorg filter function,
       and a suitable global shortcut needs to be configured in the desktop
       environment (see --toggle-window). You may optionally clear the pull
       shortcut in the settings, if D-Bus support is enabled.

       Each Tilda instance registers itself using a dynamically generated bus
       name and object path using its instance number. The first Tilda
       instance will be on the bus name:

           com.github.lanoxx.tilda.Actions0

       with object path:

           /com/github/lanoxx/tilda/Actions0

       The interface name is always:

           com.github.lanoxx.tilda.Actions

       To toggle the tilda window you can use the -T|--toggle-window option of
       tilda:
           tilda -T    # toggle default instance (i.e., 0)
           tilda -T 0  # explicitly toggle the specified instance (i.e., 0)

       Alternatively, you can also use the dbus-send command.
           dbus-send --session --type=method_call \
              --dest=com.github.lanoxx.tilda.Actions0 \
              /com/github/lanoxx/tilda/Actions0 \
              com.github.lanoxx.tilda.Actions.Toggle

       For each additional tilda instance the bus name and object path will be
       incremented by one (e.g. Actions1, Actions2, etc.).

       You can use one of the above commands to register a global hotkey in
       your Wayland session. Under Gnome, this can be done under Settings ->
       Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts.

   FILES
       Tilda creates its configuration files under ~/.config/tilda/. For each
       instance it will create a config file named config_<N>, where <N>
       starts at 0 and is incremented for each additional process that is
       started.

       Tilda also creates a cache directory under ~/.cache/tilda/locks, where
       it will create a global lock file named lock_0_0 and additional
       instance specific lock files named lock_<PID>_<N>, where <PID> is the
       process id and <N> is the instance id.

       You may optionally create a file named style.css and place it into the
       tilda config directory if you want to customize the look of tilda.
