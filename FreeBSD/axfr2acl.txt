NAME
       axfr2acl - create a BIND ACL containing "A" records from a set of zones

SYNOPSIS
       axfr2acl [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Axfr2acl collects all A records from a set of supplied DNS zones and
       writes out a DNS ACL containing all of them.  If possible, the
       addresses are compressed into CIDRs.  The resulting list is sorted
       lexicographically.

       The resulting ACL is normally written to a file, either as a list of
       CIDRs or as a BIND acl statement, if the ACL name is given.  In both
       cases, the file is sutable for inclusion in the BIND configuration
       file.  If the file already exists when the command is invoked, its
       contents is recorded and is used subsequently to determine whether it
       has changed.  The utility will actually modify the output file only if
       the constructed list differs from the one it contained initially.  It
       will also avoid running zone transfers if the serial records of all
       involved zones did not change since the last run.

       The program exits with code 0 if the file is up to date, 1 if it has
       successfully updated the file, 2 if some error ocurred and 3 if the
       command line usage was incorrect.

OPTIONS
       The following option control the output:

       --acl=name
           Format output as a bind ACL statement with the given name.

       --comment=string
           Print string as the heading comment to the output.  The argument
           can consist of multiple lines.  A "#" sign will be printed before
           each of them.

       --outfile=FILE, -o FILE
           Write the result to FILE, instead of the default "netlist".

       The following options control the selection of DNS zones and initial
       contents of the output list:

       --add-network=arg
           Add given CIDRs to the output list.  Argument is a comma-separated
           list of CIDRs.

       --from-file=FILE, -T FILE
           Populate the output list with CIDRs read from FILE.  The file must
           list each CIDR on a separate line.  Empty lines and comments
           (introduced by "#" sign) are ignored.

       --zones=zonelist, -z zonelist
           Defines a list of zones to query.  Zonelist is a comma-separated
           list of zone names.

       Options controlling log and debug output:

       --log-file=FILE, -l FILE
           Write diagnostic output to FILE, instead of standard error.

       --debug[=spec[,spec...]], -d[spec[,spec...]]
           Set debugging level.  Spec is either category or category=level,
           category is a debugging category name and level is a decimal
           verbosity level.  Valid categories are: "GENERAL" and "DNS".

       --dry-run, -n
           Don't create output file.  Instead print the result on the standard
           output.

       Informational options:

       --help, -h
           Shows a terse help summary and exit.

       --man
           Prints the manual page and exits.

CONFIGURATION
       The program reads its configuration from one of the following
       locations:

       a. The file name given by "AXFR2ACL_CONF" environment variable (if set)
       b. ~/.axfr2acl.conf
       c. /etc/axfr2acl.conf

       The first existing file from this list is used.  It is an error, if the
       $AXFR2ACL_CONF variable is set, but points to a file that does not
       exist.  It is not an error, if $AXFR2ACL_CONF is not set and neither of
       the two remaining files exist.  It is, however, an error if any of
       these file exists, but is not readable.

       The configuration file uses a usual UNIX configuration format.  Empty
       lines and UNIX comments are ignored.  Each non-empty line is either an
       option name, or option assignment, i.e. opt=val, with any amount of
       optional whitespace around the equals sign.  Valid option names are the
       same as the long command line options, but without the leading --.  For
       example:

         zones = example.net,example.com
         acl = mynets
         add-network = 10.0.0.0/8
         outfile = networks.inc

ENVIRONMENT
       AXFR2ACL_CONF
           The name of the configuration file to read, instead of the default
           /etc/axfr2acl.conf.
