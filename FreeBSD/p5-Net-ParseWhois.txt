NAME
       Net::ParseWhois - An extendable alternative to Net::Whois for parsing
       whois information.

SYNOPSIS
         # below code based on t/whois.pl in Net::ParseWhois distribution package ...

         use Net::ParseWhois;

         my $dom = 'honestabe.net';

         my $w = Net::ParseWhois::Domain->new($dom);
         unless ($w->ok) {
               warn "error: " . $w->{'error'} . "\n" if $w->{'error'};
               die "No match for $dom\n";
         }

         print "Registrar: ", $w->registrar, "\n";
         print "Domain: ", $w->domain, "\n";
         print "Name: ", $w->name, "\n";
         print "Tag: ", $w->tag, "\n";
         print "Address:\n", map { "    $_\n" } $w->address;
         print "Country: ", $w->country, "\n";
         print "Name Servers:\n", map { "    $$_[0] ($$_[1])\n" }  @{$w->servers};
         my ($c, $t);
         if ($c = $w->contacts) {
           print "Contacts:\n";
           for $t (sort keys %$c) {
             print "    $t:\n";
             print map { "\t$_\n" } @{$$c{$t}};
           }
         }
         print "Record created:", $w->record_created ;
         print "\nRecord updated:", $w->record_updated,"\n";

DESCRIPTION
       Net::ParseWhois currently only supports domains from major TLDs and
       Registrars (.com, .net & .org -- see REGISTRARS for an exact list of
       who's supported) and tries to maintain backward interface compatability
       with Net::Whois.

       Net::ParseWhois is my attempt at updating Net::Whois to support whois
       referrals. The author of Net::Whois (Dana Hudes) and I disgreed on how
       to solve the problem of parsing a distrubuted and non-standardized
       whois system, so I created this divergent module. (It's my
       understanding that Mr. Hudes wants to create an IETF draft and assumes
       registrars/registries will then follow it. I've simply taken the
       current not-so-defined situation and coded around it.)

       Net::ParseWhois contains a generalized parsing system that can be
       configured for each Registrar, or completely overridden as needed.

       The class "Net::ParseWhois::Domain::Registrar" contains a list of known
       servers that could be returned in a whois referral, and specifies the
       specific class to use for each. When "Net::ParseWhois" receives a
       referral from the 'root' whois server, it creates the specified object
       and calls follow_referral on that object. If a domain is found and a
       referral given, but no Registrar class has been defined to handle that
       referral, the method ok will return true but method 'unknown_registrar'
       will also return true. Net::ParseWhois will still follow the referral,
       and the raw output from the registrar will be available via the method
       'raw_whois_text'.

       Note: Now that CoreNic is supported (thanks Vern!), Net::ParseWhois's
       supported registrars should cover upwards of 90% of the GTLD
       registrations that are out there.

COMMON METHODS (Specific to Net::ParseWhois)
       new("a-domain-name-goes-here")
         Creates a new instance of a Net::ParseWhois object, which attempts a
       lookup of the specified domain name.

       ok
         Returns a boolean value indicating whether the Net::ParseWhois object
       is "safe" or not. If it returns false, then a match was not found or
       some other error occurred when creating the object. A value of true
       indicates a match was found and the various methods for returning
       Registrar data should function.
         Coders should always check this method first after creating a new
       Net::ParseWhois object to avoid script failures.

       error
         Returns the error message indicating why the Whois lookup could not
       be completed. Will return null if there is no error.

         print "Tag: ", $w->tag, "\n";
         print "Country: ", $w->country, "\n";
         print "Name Servers:\n", map { "    $$_[0] ($$_[1])\n" }  @{$w->servers};
         if ($c = $w->contacts) {
           print "Contacts:\n";
           for $t (sort keys %$c) {
             print "    $t:\n";
             print map { "\t$_\n" } @{$$c{$t}};

       The following methods apply only to when a succesful WHOIS lookup was
       performed.

       domain
         Returns the domain name the Net::ParseWhois object looked up.

       registrar
         Returns the name of the registrar of the domain

       record_created
         Returns the date and time the domain's entry was put into this
       registrar's system. Note that this does not necessarily reflect the
       original registration date of the domain!

       record_updated
         Returns the date and time the domain's entry was last updated.
       Updates include changes to contact info, registered name servers, etc.

       name
         Returns the name of the entity that registerted the domain. Typically
       this will be the name of either a person or a company, but pretty much
       depends on what was used in the initial registration process.

       address
         Returns an array of strings representing the physical address
       registered for the domain. This will be the domain owner's address, not
       that of a technical or administrative contact.
