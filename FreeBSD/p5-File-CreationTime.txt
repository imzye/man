File::CreationTime(3)                      User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       File::CreationTime - Keeps track of file creation times

VERSION
       Version 2.04

SYNOPSIS
       Keeps track of creation times on filesystems that don't normally
       provide such information.

           use File::CreationTime;

           my $file = '/path/to/file';
           print "$file was created: ". creation_time($file). "\n";

EXPORT
   creation_time

FUNCTIONS
   creation_time
            creation_time('/path/to/file')

       Returns the creation time of /path/to/file in seconds past the epoch.
       Requires permission to modify extended filesystem attributes the first
       time the function is called.  All subsequent invocations require read
       access only.

ACCURACY
       The algorithm used to determine the creation time is as follows.  The
       first time creation_time is called, an extended filesystem attribute
       called creation_time is created and is set to contain the time that the
       file was most recently modified.  As such, if you have a file that's
       several years old, then modify it, then call creation_time, the file's
       creation time will obviously be wrong.  However, if you create a file,
       call creation_time, wait several years, modify the file, then call
       creation_time again, the result will be accurate.

       On OS X, this method is not used.  Instead, the actual creation time is
       provided via "MacOSX::File::Info->ctime".

DIAGNOSTICS
   [path] does not exist
       You passed [path] to creation_time, but it doesn't exist (or you can't
       read it).

   Failed to set attribute user.creation_time on [file]
       Couldn't create the attribute for some reason.  Does your filesystem
       support extended filesystem attributes?

SEE ALSO
       File::Attributes handles storing the creation_time attribute.

BUGS
       I'd like to support OSes that actually give you the file creation time.
       As of version 2.04, OS X is supported in this way.  If you know how to
       make this work on your OS, tell me how or send me a patch.

       Other comments and patches are always welcome.
