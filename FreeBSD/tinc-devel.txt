TINC-GUI(8)             FreeBSD System Manager's Manual            TINC-GUI(8)

NAME
     tinc-gui – tinc GUI

SYNOPSIS
     tinc-gui [-n] [--net=NETNAME] [--pidfile=FILENAME] [--help]

DESCRIPTION
     This is a Python/wxWidgets based graphical user interface for tinc, a
     secure virtual private network (VPN) project.  tinc-gui communicates with
     tincd(8) to alter and inspect the running VPN's state.  It can show the
     current settings, the list of connections, nodes, subnets, and edges.
     For now, the debug level can be changed from the GUI, and by right-
     clicking on a node in the list of connections, a pop-up menu will appear
     that allows one to disconnect that node.

OPTIONS
     -n, --net=NETNAME
             Communicate with tincd(8) connected with NETNAME.

     --pidfile=FILENAME
             Use the cookie from FILENAME to authenticate with a running tinc
             daemon.  If unspecified, the default is
             /var/run/tinc.NETNAME.pid.

     --help  Display short list of options.

BUGS
     The GUI is not finished yet, the final version will have much more
     functionality.  If you find any bugs, report them to tinc@tinc-vpn.org.
