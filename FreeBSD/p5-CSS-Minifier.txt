NAME
       CSS::Minifier - Perl extension for minifying CSS

SYNOPSIS
       To minify a CSS file and have the output written directly to another
       file

         use CSS::Minifier qw(minify);
         open(INFILE, 'myStylesheet.css') or die;
         open(OUTFILE, 'myStylesheet.css') or die;
         minify(input => *INFILE, outfile => *OUTFILE);
         close(INFILE);
         close(OUTFILE);

       To minify a CSS string literal. Note that by omitting the outfile
       parameter a the minified code is returned as a string.

         my minifiedCSS = minify(input => 'div {font-family: serif;}');

       To include a copyright comment at the top of the minified code.

         minify(input => 'div {font-family: serif;}', copyright => 'BSD License');

       The "input" parameter is manditory. The "output" and "copyright"
       parameters are optional and can be used in any combination.

DESCRIPTION
       This module removes unnecessary whitespace from CSS. The primary
       requirement developing this module is to not break working stylesheets:
       if working CSS is in input then working CSS is output. The Mac/Internet
       Explorer comment hack will be minimized but not stripped and so will
       continue to function.

       This module understands space, horizontal tab, new line, carriage
       return, and form feed characters to be whitespace. Any other characters
       that may be considered whitespace are not minimized. These other
       characters include paragraph separator and vertical tab.

       For static CSS files, it is recommended that you minify during the
       build stage of web deployment. If you minify on-the-fly then it might
       be a good idea to cache the minified file. Minifying static files on-
       the-fly repeatedly is wasteful.

   EXPORT
       None by default.

       Exportable on demand: minifiy()
