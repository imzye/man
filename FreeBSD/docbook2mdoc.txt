DOCBOOK2MDOC(1)         FreeBSD General Commands Manual        DOCBOOK2MDOC(1)

NAME
     docbook2mdoc – convert DocBook to mdoc

SYNOPSIS
     docbook2mdoc [-W] [-s section] [-T mdoc | tree | lint] [file]

DESCRIPTION
     The docbook2mdoc utility reads DocBook input from a file and translates
     it to mdoc(7) and eqn(7).  If file is omitted, standard input is used.

     The options are as follows:

     -s  Specify the manual page section to be used as the second argument of
         the Dt macro.  Defaults to the content of the first <manvolnum>
         element in the first <refmeta> block, if any, or to "1" otherwise.

     -T  Select the output mode.  The following arguments are supported:

         mdoc  Translate the input to mdoc(7).  This is the default.

         tree  Dump a human-readable representation of the parse tree.  Each
               output line shows one tree node.  Child nodes are indented with
               respect to their parent node.  The columns are:

               1.  An asterisk if the node starts a new text line, or a hyphen
                   if the node follows the previous node without intervening
                   whitespace.

               2.  The node type.

               3.  For text nodes, the text contents.  For other nodes, the
                   attributes, if any.

         lint  Do not produce any output, only error messages.  Can be
               combined with -W.

     -W  Report warnings on standard error output, and if any occur, raise the
         EXIT STATUS to at least 2.

     A subset of DocBook 5.1 elements are recognized, as well as some elements
     from earlier versions.  The parser is optimized for robustness even on
     invalid input, always producing some output on a best-effort basis.
     Input is not required to be well-formed, nor to adhere to DocBook
     syntactic or semantic requirements.

     Unknown elements are ignored in the sense that they do not affect
     formatting and only their content is rendered.  Unknown attributes are
     silently discarded.

     In addition to DocBook elements, the following constructs are handled:

     <!DOCTYPE ... [ <!ENTITY name "definition"> ]>
             Internal subset declaration to define an XML entity.

     <!DOCTYPE ... [ <!ENTITY name SYSTEM "file"> ]>
             Internal subset declaration to define an XML entity using an
             external file.

     <!DOCTYPE ... [ <!ENTITY % name SYSTEM "file"> %name ]>
             Internal subset declaration to include an external file that is
             supposed to contain entity declarations.

     <mml:...>
             Elements from the MathML namespace.  These are translated to
             eqn(7).

     <xi:include ... href="file">
             Include an external DocBook file into the current document.

EXIT STATUS
     The docbook2mdoc utility exits with one of the following values:

     0   No error occurred, and if -W was specified, no warning occurred
         either.

     2   At least one warning occurred, but no error, and -W was specified.

     3   At least one parsing error occurred.

     5   Invalid command line arguments were specified.  No input files have
         been read.

     6   Memory was exhausted.  Parsing was aborted immediately.

EXAMPLES
     To pipe a DocBook document foo.xml through mandoc(1) and a pager:

           $ docbook2mdoc foo.xml | mandoc -l

DIAGNOSTICS
     Messages displayed by docbook2mdoc follow this format:

           docbook2mdoc: file:line:column: level: message

     The first three fields identify the file name, line number, and column
     number of the input file where the message was triggered.  The line and
     column numbers start at 1.

     Message levels have the following meanings:

     fatal    An operating system error occurred, typically memory exhaustion,
              and parsing was aborted immediately.

     error    Indicates a risk of information loss or severe misformatting,
              for example caused by unknown elements or missing include files.

     warning  Indicates a risk that the information shown or its formatting
              may mismatch the author's intent in minor ways.  For example,
              mismatched or missing end tags are classified as warnings.
