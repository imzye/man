COMMANDS
   age
       age commands

       Built-in commands for the age backend.  These allow limited
       interactions with the gopass specific age identities.
        Added identities are automatically added as recipient to your secrets
       when encrypting, but not toyour recipients, make sure to keep your
       recipients and identities in sync as you want to.  All age identities,
       including plugin ones should be supported. We also still support
       githubidentities despite them being deprecated by age, we do so by
       falling back to the ssh identitiesfor these and keeping a local cache
       of ssh keys for a given github identity.

   alias
       Print domain aliases

       Print defined domain aliases.

   audit
       Decrypt all secrets and scan for weak or leaked passwords

       This command decrypts all secrets and checks for common flaws and
       (optionally) against a list of previously leaked passwords.

       Flags

       --format,
              Output format. text, csv or html. Default: text

       --full,
              Print full details of all findings. Default: false

       --output-file,
              -o, Output filename. Used for csv and html

       --summary,
              Print a summary of the audit results. Default: true (print
              summary)

       --template,
              HTML template. If not set use the built-in default.

   cat
       Decode and print content of a binary secret to stdout, or encode and
       insert from stdin

       This command is similar to the way cat works on the command line. It
       can either be used to retrieve the decoded content of a secret similar
       to 'cat file' or vice versa to encode the content from STDIN to a
       secret.

   clone
       Clone a password store from a git repository

       This command clones an existing password store from a git remote to a
       local password store. Can be either used to initialize a new root store
       or to add a new mounted sub-store. Needs at least one argument (git
       URL) to clone from. Accepts a second argument (mount location) to clone
       and mount a sub-store, e.g. 'gopass clone git@example.com/store.git
       foo/bar'

       Flags

       --check-keys,
              Check for valid decryption keys. Generate new keys if none are
              found.

       --path,
              Path to clone the repo to

       --storage,
              Select storage backend [fossilfs gitfs]

   config
       Display and edit the configuration file

       This command allows for easy printing and editing of the configuration.
       Without argument, the entire config is printed. With a single argument,
       a single key can be printed. With two arguments a setting specified by
       key can be set to value.

       Flags

       --store,
              Set options to a specific store

   convert
       Convert a store to different backends

       Convert a store to a different set of backends

              Replace store?

       --storage,
              Which storage backend? [fossilfs fs gitfs]

       --store,
              Specify which store to convert

   copy
       Copy secrets from one location to another

       This command copies an existing secret in the store to another
       location. This also works across different sub-stores. If the source is
       a directory it will automatically copy recursively. In that case, the
       source directory is re-created at the destination if no trailing slash
       is found, otherwise the contents are flattened (similar to rsync).

       Flags

       --force,
              -f, Force to copy the secret and overwrite existing one

   create
       Easy creation of new secrets

       This command starts a wizard to aid in creation of new secrets.

       Flags

       --force,
              -f, Force path selection

       --store,
              -s, Which store to use

   delete
       Remove one or many secrets from the store

       This command removes secrets. It can work recursively on folders.
       Recursing across stores is purposefully not supported.

       Flags

       --force,
              -f, Force to delete the secret

       --recursive,
              -r, Recursive delete files and folders

   edit
       Edit new or existing secrets

       Use this command to insert a new secret or edit an existing one using
       your $EDITOR. It will attempt to create a secure temporary directory
       for storing your secret while the editor is accessing it. Please make
       sure your editor doesn't leak sensitive data to other locations while
       editing.  Note: If $EDITOR is not set we will try 'editor'. If that's
       not available either we fall back to 'vi'. Consider using 'update-
       alternatives --config editor to change the defaults.

       Flags

       --create,
              -c, Create a new secret if none found

       This command will first attempt a simple pattern match on the name of
       the secret.  If there is an exact match it will be shown directly; if
       there are multiple matches, a selection will be shown.

       Flags

       --regex,
              -r, Interpret pattern as regular expression

       --unsafe,
              -u, --force, -f, In the case of an exact match, display the
              password even if safecontent is enabled

   fsck
       Check store integrity, clean up artifacts and possibly re-write secrets

       Check the integrity of the given sub-store or all stores if none are
       specified. Will automatically fix all issues found, i.e. it will change

   fscopy
       Copy files from or to the password store

       This command either reads a file from the filesystem and writes the
       encoded and encrypted version in the store or it decrypts and decodes a
       secret and writes the result to a file. Either source or destination
       must be a file and the other one a secret. If you want the source to be
       securely removed after copying, use 'gopass binary move'

   fsmove
       Move files from or to the password store

       This command either reads a file from the filesystem and writes the
       encoded and encrypted version in the store or it decrypts and decodes a
       secret and writes the result to a file. Either source or destination
       must be a file and the other one a secret. The source will be wiped
       from disk or from the store after it has been copied successfully and
       validated. If you don't want the source to be removed use 'gopass
       binary copy'

   generate
       Generate a new password

       Dialog to generate a new password and write it into a new or existing
       secret. By default, the new password will replace the first line of an

       --xkcd,
              -x, Use multiple random english words combined to a password. By
