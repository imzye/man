NAME
       reoback.pl - A simple backup solution.


SYNOPSIS
       reoback.pl [OPTION] [CONFIG-FILE]


DESCRIPTION
       Pronounced as "Ray-o-back", REOBack is a simple backup solution
       designed for Linux Users AND System Administrators. It is designed to
       be simple to set-up and and easy to use. Great as a quick solution for
       those who procrastinate about backups.


       Backups are performed by reading the user supplied configuration files
       and creating tar/gzip archives of the files defined.  REOBack is
       developed to support nightly backups runs and as such, its first run is
       always a full backup.  That is, archive every file regardless of its
       modification stamp.


       REOBack keeps track of what type of backup to perform by storing backup
       information in the "datadir" directory defined in the configuration
       file.  Therefore, deleting all files in the "datadir" directory will
       cause REOBack to perform a full backup on its next run.


       REOBack can keep backups for any number of days.  The variable
       "backupdays" in  the configuration defines this number.  For example: a
       setting of "7", will cause REOBack to keep seven days of backup.  It
       will then delete old backups after reaching the next "7" days.  Here's
       an example:


       Assume we want to keep 7 days worth of backup, that is keep a history
       of any file for 7 days.


       backupdays = 7 (set in the configuration file)

       DAY  BACKUPTYPE        |     DAY    BACKUPTYPE

       -------------------------------------------------------

       1    FULL              |      8     FULL

       2    INC               |      9     INC

       3    INC               |      10    INC

       4    INC               |      11    INC

       5    INC               |      12    INC

       6    INC               |      13    INC

       7    INC (Delete 8-14) |      14    INC (Delete (1-7)


       Notice that it keeps 14 days (backupdays x 2) worth of backup before it
       deletes the old backups.  That is because we don't want to delete the
       old backups until the next full backups are finished.


       When running a FULL backup, REOBack will archive ALL files and
       directories defined.  INCREMENTAL backups on the other hand only
       archives files that changes since the last full backup.  This means
       that if you added or modified files in a directory defined for backups,
       after the last full backup time, they will be picked up in every run
       until the next full backup time passes.
