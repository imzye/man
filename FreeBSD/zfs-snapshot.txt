NAME
     zfs-snapshot – create snapshots of ZFS datasets

SYNOPSIS
     zfs snapshot [-r] [-o property=value]… dataset@snapname…

DESCRIPTION
     All previous modifications by successful system calls to the file system
     are part of the snapshots.  Snapshots are taken atomically, so that all
     snapshots correspond to the same moment in time.  zfs snap can be used as
     an alias for zfs snapshot.  See the Snapshots section of zfsconcepts(7)
     for details.

     -o property=value
         Set the specified property; see zfs create for details.

     -r  Recursively create snapshots of all descendent datasets
