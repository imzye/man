RDMA_REG_MSGS(3)         Librdmacm Programmer's Manual        RDMA_REG_MSGS(3)



NAME
       rdma_reg_msgs - register data buffer(s) for sending or receiving
       messages.

SYNOPSIS
       #include <rdma/rdma_verbs.h>

       struct ibv_mr * rdma_reg_msgs (struct rdma_cm_id *id, void *addr,
       size_t length);

ARGUMENTS
       id          A reference to a communication identifier where the message
                   buffer(s) will be used.

       addr        The address of the memory buffer(s) to register.

       length      The total length of the memory to register.

DESCRIPTION
       Registers an array of memory buffers used for sending and receiving
       messages or for RDMA operations.  Memory buffers registered using
       rdma_reg_msgs may be posted to an rdma_cm_id using rdma_post_send or
       rdma_post_recv, or specified as the target of an RDMA read operation or
       the source of an RDMA write request.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns a reference to the registered memory region on success, or NULL
       on error.  If an error occurs, errno will be set to indicate the
       failure reason.

NOTES
       rdma_reg_msgs is used to register an array of data buffers that will be
       used send and/or receive messages on a queue pair associated with an
       rdma_cm_id.  The memory buffer is registered with the proteection
       domain associated with the idenfier.  The start of the data buffer
       array is specified through the addr parameter, and the total size of
       the array is given by length.

       All data buffers should be registered before being posted as a work
       request.  Users must deregister all registered memory by calling
       rdma_dereg_mr.
