NAME
       adig - print information collected from Domain Name System (DNS)
       servers

SYNOPSIS
       adig [@server] [-c class] [-p port#] [-q name] [-t type] [-x addr]
       [name] [type] [class] [queryopt...]


DESCRIPTION
       Send queries to DNS servers about name and print received information,
       where name is a valid DNS name (e.g. www.example.com, 1.2.3.10.in-
       addr.arpa).

       This utility comes with the c-ares asynchronous resolver library.

       It is possible to specify default arguments for adig via
       ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/adigrc.

ARGS
       @server
              Server ip address.  May specify multiple in comma delimited
              format. May be specified in URI format.

       name   Name of the resource record that is to be looked up

       type   What type of query is required.  e.g. - A, AAAA, MX, TXT, etc.
              If not specified, A will be used.

       class  Sets the query class, defaults to IN.  May also be HS or CH.


FLAGS
       -c class
              Sets the query class, defaults to IN.  May also be HS or CH.

       -h     Prints the help.

       -p port
              Sends query to a port other than 53.  Often recommended to set
              the port using @server instead.

       -q name
              Specifies the domain name to query. Useful to distinguish name
              from other arguments

       -r     Skip adigrc processing

       -s     Server (alias for @server syntax), compatibility with old
              cmdline

       -t type
              Indicates resource record type to query. Useful to distinguish
              type from other arguments

       -x addr
              Simplified reverse lookups.  Sets the type to PTR and forms a
              valid in-arpa query string
