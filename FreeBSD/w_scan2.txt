NAME
       w_scan2 - a universal ATSC and DVB blind scanner

SYNOPSIS
       w_scan2 -fa -c <COUNTRY_ID> [ options ]
       w_scan2 -fc -c <COUNTRY_ID> [ options ]
       w_scan2 -ft -c <COUNTRY_ID> [ options ]
       w_scan2 -fs -s <SATELLITE_ID> [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       w_scan2 scans for DVB-C, DVB-S/S2, DVB-T/T2, ISDB-T and ATSC channels.
       Any other program accessing the DVB hardware (like e.g. VDR) has to be
       closed in order to avoid conflicts while running w_scan2.
       w_scan2 provides the channels in different output formats (Default: VDR
       channels.conf). For other output formats see OPTIONS.

OPTIONS
       The following options are available.

       -f TYPE
              Frontend type,
              "a" = ATSC,
              "c" = DVB-C,
              "s" = DVB-S/S2,
              "t" = DVB-T, DVB-T2 and ISDB-T [default]
              "t1" = only DVB-T
              "t2" = only DVB-T2
              Depending on "TYPE", either of the arguments "-s" or "-c" is
              mandatory.

       -c COUNTRY_ID
              Mandatory argument for ATSC scans, cable scans and terrestrial
              scans, see option -f.
              Specifies the country where you try to scan for channels as
              uppercase two letter identifier, e.g.
              DE = Germany,
              US = United States,
              FR = France
              Use "-c?" for a list of all known identifiers.

       -s SATELLITE_ID
              Mandatory argument for satellite scans, see option -f.
              Specifies the satellite you wish to scan as uppercase
              identifier, e.g.
              S19E2 = 19.2° east,
              S13E0 = 13.0° east,
              S0W8 = 0.8° west.
              Use "-s?" for a list of all known identifiers.

       -A N   specify ATSC scan type
              1 = terrestrial [default],
              2 = cable,
              3 = both, cable and terrestrial.

       -o N   VDR channels.conf format
              2 = VDR-2.0 [default],
              21 = VDR-2.1

       -X     generate zap/czap/xine output instead of VDR channels.conf.

       -x     generate initial tuning data output for (dvb-)scan instead of
              VDR channels.conf.

       -5     generate initial tuning data output for dvbv5-scan instead of
              VDR channels.conf.

       -L     generate VLC xspf playlist (experimental)

       -M     mplayer output instead of vdr channels.conf

       -G     generate output for Gstreamer dvbsrc plugin

       -h     show help

       -H     show expert help

EXPERT OPTIONS
       -C CHARSET
              specifies the output charset, i.e. "UTF-8", "ISO-8859-15"
              use 'iconv --list' to see full list of charsets.

       -I FILE
              import dvbscan initial_tuning_data

       -v     verbose (repeat for more)

       -q     quiet (repeat for less)

       -R N   Radio channels
              0 = don't search radio channels
              1 = search radio channels [default]

       -T N   TV channels
              0 = don't search TV channels,
              1 = search TV channels [default]

       -O N   Other services
              0 = don't search other services [default]

       -d     Delete duplicate transponders
              with this option, only the first transponder copy is kept,
              regardless of the signal strength, so if you are in an area with
              the same transponders being broadcast from different sources,
              this will prevent you from searching for services in all of them

       -a N   use device /dev/dvb/adapterN/ [default: auto detect]
              (also allowed: -a /dev/dvb/adapterN/frontendM)

       -F     Long filter timeout for reading data from hardware.

       -t N   Tuning timeout, increasing may help if device tunes slowly or
              has bad reception.
              1 = fastest [default],
              2 = medium,
              3 = slowest

       -i N   spectral inversion setting for cable TV
              0 = off,
              1 = on,
              2 = auto [default]

       -Q     DVB-C modulation [default: choosen by country]

              1 = QAM256,
              2 = QAM128

       -S RATE
              set DVB-C symbol rate, see table: [default: choosen by country]
              NOTE: for experienced users only!!
              0 = 6.9000 MSymbol/s

              10 = 6.0860 MSymbol/s
              11 = 5.9000 MSymbol/s
              12 = 5.4830 MSymbol/s
              13 = 5.2170 MSymbol/s
              14 = 5.1560 MSymbol/s

       -P     ATSC scan: do not use ATSC PSIP tables for scan (PAT and PMT
              only)

EXAMPLES
       scan satellite 19.2° east:
              w_scan2 -fs -s S19E2

       scan cable (DVB), Germany:
              w_scan2 -fc -c DE

       scan aerial (DVB), France:
              w_scan2 -ft -c FR

       scan cable (ATSC), United States:
              w_scan2 -fa -A2 -c US

       scan aerial (ATSC), United States:
              w_scan2 -fa -A1 -c US

       use output format zap/czap/xine:
              w_scan2 [ OTHER OPTIONS ] -X

       use output format dvbscan/scan/scan-s2 initial tuning data.
              w_scan2 [ OTHER OPTIONS ] -x
              NOTE: w_scan2 also performs full scans, so there is generally no
              need for this.
