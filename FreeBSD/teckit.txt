NAME
       sfconv - A tool for converting the encoding of Standard Format (SF)
       files

SYNOPSIS
   8-bit to Unicode:
       sfconv -8u [-utf8|-be|-le] [-bom] -c ControlFile [-d MappingDirectory]
       -i InFile -o OutFile

   Unicode to 8-bit:
       sfconv -u8 [-utf8|-be|-le] -c ControlFile [-d MappingDirectory] -i
       InFile -o OutFile

DESCRIPTION
       A tool for converting Standard Format (SF) files is included in the
       current TECkit package.  This is sfconv , a command-line tool that uses
       an XML “control file” to specify the mappings associated with the
       various markers in an SF file. Note that the current SFconv tool should
       be considered a prototype rather than a full solution to the issue of
       SF conversions. A more complete tool with an improved user interface
       would be desirable.

OPTIONS
       The SFconv utility uses command-line options to specify the conversion
       direction, control file, and input and output files. The required
       arguments are:

       -8u|-u8
              conversion direction: 8-bit to Unicode or vice versa

       -ccontrolFile
              specifies XML control file

       -iinFile
              specifies filename of input SF file

       -ooutFile
              specifies filename for converted output

              In addition, the following optional arguments may be used if
              appropriate:

       -dmappingDir
              directory where mapping files ( .tec files) are to be found

       -utf8|-be|-le
              Unicode encoding form: UTF-8, UTF-16BE, or UTF16-LE (default is
              UTF8 for output, or detected from input file if BOM is present)

       -bom   (only when mapping to Unicode) write initial BOM to the output
              file

       -nfc|-nfd
              (only when mapping to Unicode) normalize to NFC or NFD

       system, this can be found in /usr/share/doc/teckit.
