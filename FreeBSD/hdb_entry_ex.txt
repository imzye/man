NAME
       hdb_entry_ex -

SYNOPSIS
       #include <hdb.h>

Detailed Description
       hdb_entry_ex is a wrapper structure around the hdb_entry structure that
       allows backends to keep a pointer to the backing store, ie in
       ->hdb_fetch_kvno(), so that we the kadmin/kpasswd backend gets around
       to ->hdb_store(), the backend doesn't need to lookup the entry again.
