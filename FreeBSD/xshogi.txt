NAME
       xshogi - Xt/Athena user interface for gnushogi

SYNOPSIS
       xshogi [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       xshogi provides an X11/Xt/Athena Widgets user interface for gnushogi.
       With xshogi you can play gnushogi, set up arbitrary positions, force
       variations, or watch xshogi manage a game between two shogi programs.
       Furthermore, it can be used as an interface between two players on
       different displays.

       xshogi can also be used as a shogi board to play out games.  It will
       read through a game file or allow a player to play through a variation
       manually (force mode).  This is useful for keeping track of email
       postal games or browsing games off the net.

       After starting xshogi, you can make moves by pressing mouse button 1
       while the cursor is over a square with your piece on it and dragging
       the mouse to another square.  If the move is illegal, gnushogi will not
       allow it.  xshogi will then retract the move.


RULES
       Shogi is a Japanese board game played by two players.  The object of
       the game is to capture the opponent's King.  Shogi is played on a nine-
       by-nine board. The vertical rows are called files, the horizontal ones
       ranks or just rows. Each player has twenty pieces: one King, two Gold
       Generals, two Silver Generals, two kNights, two Lances, one Rook, one
       Bishop and nine Pawns.  The player moving up the board and making the
       first move is referred to as black and his opponent white, although in
       Shogi sets all pieces have the same colour. They are differentiated
       only in direction: pieces pointing away from a player are his. The
       pieces lie flat on the board and have their Japanese name written on
       them.


   Moves
       King    one step in any direction per move

       Gold General
               one step per move any way except diagonally backward (as a king
               but not diagonally backward)

       Silver General
               one step per move forwards or diagonally (as a king but not
               sideways or vertically backward)

       Knight  one step to left or right, and two steps forward (the only
               piece which may jump over other pieces)

       Rook    moves vertically or horizontally any distance

       Bishop  moves diagonally any distance

       Lance   moves forward any distance

       Pawn    one step forward


   Promotion
       The three rows furthest away from a player are called the promotion
       zone. Apart from the King and the Gold, any piece can be promoted to a
       more powerful piece when it makes a move completely or partly in the
       promotion zone. So, when a piece moves into, out of or fully inside the
       promotion zone it may be promoted upon completion of its move.
       Promotion is optional, provided that the piece still can make a legal
       move in case it is not promoted: if a Pawn or a Lance move to the last
       row, or a Knight moves to either of the last two rows, it must be
       promoted. In Shogi sets promoting a piece is done by turning this piece
       upside down. Its promoted name is written on its other side.

       Apart from the King and the Gold General all pieces can promote.  After
       promotion their moves are as follows:

       +       Promoted Silver, promoted kNight, promoted Lance and promoted
               Pawn all move as a Gold.

       +       The promoted Rook in addition to the moves of the unpromoted
               Rook can move one step in the diagonal directions. It either
               moves like a Rook or like a King.

       +       The promoted Bishop in addition to the moves of the unpromoted
               Bishop can move one step horizontally or vertically. It either
               moves like a Bishop or like a King.


   Capturing and dropping pieces
       When one piece moves onto the same square as an opponent's piece, the
       opponent's piece is captured. All pieces capture in the same way that
       they move. Captured pieces become part of the capturer's force. In a
       later move, instead of moving a piece on the board, a player may put a
       piece that he has captured from his opponent back onto the board, in an
       empty square.  This is called dropping a piece. Pieces are always
       dropped unpromoted: if a promoted piece is captured, it reverts to its
       unpromoted rank.  Pieces may be dropped on any empty square on the
       board with only three restrictions:

       1)      After dropping a piece it must be able to make a legal move.
               This applies to Pawns, Knights or Lances. They may not be
               dropped onto a square from which they will never be able to
               move.

       2)      Attacking the King by dropping a Pawn on the square in front of
               him is not allowed if the King cannot prevent being captured on
               the following move.  To use the Chess expression: checkmating
               the King with a Pawn drop is prohibited.

       3)      A pawn may only be dropped on a file (vertical row) if there is
               no other unpromoted pawn of the same player on that file.


   Draws
       The game of Shogi has very few draws (roughly 1 percent), mainly
       because of the possibility to drop pieces. Draws cannot be offered and
       can arise from two situations:

       1)      A position (including the pieces in hand) occurs 4 times with
               the same player to move ("Sennichite"). However, if this is
               caused by consecutive checks (direct attacks on the King,
               threatening to capture it on the next move) by one side, the
               player giving these checks loses the game.

       2)      Both players have moved their King into the the promotion zone
               (or they cannot be prevented to do so) and the Kings cannot be
               checkmated. In that case the players may decide to count their
               pieces where the King does not count, the Rook and Bishop count
               as 5 points, and all other pieces as one point. Promotion is
               disregarded. If both players have at least 24 points the game
               is a draw ("Jishogi"). If a player has less, he loses the game.

       Of course, a player can refuse to count pieces when he still has mating
       chances or chances to gain material which would affect the outcome of
       the counting. There is no strict rule about what to do if this is not
       the case, but nonetheless a player refuses to count up (e.g. because he
       does not have enough points for a draw). It has been generally accepted
       that in such a case the game ends and the pieces are counted after one
       player has managed to get all his pieces protected in the promotion
       zone.


OPTIONS
       The following command line options also correspond to X resources that
       you can set in your .Xdefaults or .Xresources file.

       standard Xt options
               xshogi accepts standard Xt options like -display, -geometry,
               -iconic, -bg etc.

       -tc or -timeControl minutes[:seconds]
               Amount of time for a set of moves determined by
               movesPerSession.  If this number of moves is played within the
               time control period, xshogi resets the time clocks.  Default: 5
               minutes.

       -mps or -movesPerSession moves
               Number of moves in a time control period.  Default: 40 moves.

       -st or -searchTime minutes[:seconds]
               Tell gnushogi to spend at most the given amount of time
               searching for each of its moves.  Without this option, gnushogi
               chooses its search time based on the number of moves and amount
               of time remaining until the next time control.  Setting this
               option also sets -clockMode to False.

       -sd or -searchDepth number
               Tell gnushogi to look ahead at most the given number of moves
               when searching for a move to make.  Without this option,
               gnushogi chooses its search depth based on the number of moves
               and amount of time remaining until the next time control.
               Setting this option also sets -clockMode to False.

       -clock or -clockMode (True | False)
               Determines whether or not to use the clock.  If clockMode is
               False, the clock does not run, but the side that is to play
               next is still highlighted.

       -td or -timeDelay seconds
               Time delay between moves during "Load Game".  This doesn't have
               to be round numbers.  Try -td 0.4.  Default: 1 second.

       -nsp or -noShogiProgram (True | False)
               If this option is True, xshogi acts as a passive shogiboard; it
               does not try to start a shogi program, not even to check
               whether moves made in Force mode are legal.  It also sets
               -clockMode to False.  Default: False.

       -fsp or -firstShogiProgram program
               Name of first shogi program.  In matches between two machines,
               this program plays white.  Default: "gnushogi".

       -ssp or -secondShogiProgram program
               Name of second shogi program, if needed.  In matches between
               two machines, this program plays black; otherwise it is not
               started.  Default: "gnushogi".

       -fh or -firstHost host
               Name of host the first shogi program plays on.  Default:
               "localhost".

       -sh or -secondHost host
               Name of host the second shogi program plays on.  Default:
               "localhost".

       -rsh or -remoteShell shell_name
               Some systems do not use rsh as the remote shell.  This option
               allows a user to name the remote shell command.  This should be
               done in the resource file.

       -mm or -matchMode (False | Init | Position | Opening)
               Automatically run a game between firstShogiProgram and
               secondShogiProgram.  If matchMode is set to Init, xshogi will
               start the game with the initial shogi position.  If matchMode
               is set to Position, xshogi will start the game with the
               position specified by the loadPositionFile resource.  If
               matchMode is set to Opening, xshogi will play out the opening
               moves specified by the -loadGameFile resource.  If the
               -saveGameFile resource is set, a move record for the match will
               be saved in the specified file.  Default: "False".

       -lgf or -loadGameFile file
               Name of file to read a game record from.  Game files are found
               in the directory named by the SHOGIDIR environment variable.
               If this variable is not set, the current directory is used
               unless the file name starts with a /.

       -lpf or -loadPositionFile file
               Name of file to read a game position from.  Position files are
               found in the directory named by the SHOGIDIR environment
               variable.  If this variable is not set, the current directory
               is used unless the file name starts with a /.

       -sgf or -saveGameFile file
               Name of file to save a game record to.  Game files are saved in
               the directory named by the SHOGIDIR environment variable.  If
               this variable is not set, the current directory is used unless
               the file name starts with a /.

       -spf or -savePositionFile file
               Name of file to save a game position to.  Position files are
               saved in the directory named by the SHOGIDIR environment
               variable.  If this variable is not set, the current directory
               is used unless the file name starts with a /.

       -coords or -showCoords (True | False)
               If this option is True, xshogi displays algebraic coordinates
               along the board's left and bottom edges.  The default is False.
               The coordFont resource specifies what font to use.

       -mono or -monoMode (True | False)
               Monochrome mode.  You shouldn't have to specify monochrome.
               xshogi will determine if this is necessary.

       -pc or -pieceColor color
               Color specification for pieces suitable for XParseColor().
               Default: #FFFFD7.

       -sc or -squareColor color
               Same for squares.  Default: #EBDFB0.

       -wps or -westernPieceSet (True | False)
               Choose the Western style piece set.

       -npb or -normalPawnBitmap file
       -nnb or -normalKnightBitmap file
       -nbb or -normalBishopBitmap file
       -nrb or -normalRookBitmap file
       -nkb or -normalKingBitmap file
               Names of the bitmap files for the bitmap piece icons.

       -rpb or -reversePawnBitmap file
       -rnb or -reverseKnightBitmap file
       -rbb or -reverseBishopBitmap file
       -rrb or -reverseRookBitmap file
       -rkb or -reverseKingBitmap file
               Names of the bitmap files for the outline piece icons.

       -debug or -debugMode (True | False)
               Turns on debugging printout.

RESOURCES
       initString
               The actual string that is sent to initialize the shogi program
               can be set from .Xdefaults.  It can't be set from the command
               line because of syntax problems.  The default value is
               "new\nbeep\nrandom\neasy\n".  The "new" and "beep" commands are
               required.  You can remove the "random" command if you like;
               including it causes gnushogi to randomize its move selection
               slightly so that it doesn't play the same moves in every game.
               Even without "random", gnushogi randomizes its choice of moves
               from its opening book.  You can also remove "easy" if you like;
               including it toggles easy mode off, causing gnushogi to think
               on your time.  That is, if "easy" is included in the
               initString, gnushogi thinks on your time; if not, it does not.
               (Yes, this does seem backwards, doesn't it.)  You can also try
               adding other commands to the initString; see the gnushogi
               documentation for details.

       blackString and whiteString
               These resources control what is sent when the Machine Black and
               Machine White buttons are selected.  This is mostly for
               compatibility with obsolete versions of gnushogi.

       Alternate bitmaps for piece icons can be specified either by choosing
       one of the built-in sets or with the file name resources described
       above.  There are three built-in sets of piece bitmaps available, large
       (the default), medium, or small.  It is easiest to select the set you
       prefer in the .Xdefaults file:

       XShogi*boardSize:   Medium

       The font used for button labels and comments can be changed in the
       .Xdefaults file.  You may want to choose a smaller font if you are
       using the small pieces:

       XShogi*font:    helvetica_oblique12

       The font used for coordinates (when the showCoords option is True) can
       be set similarly:

       XShogi*coordFont:    helvetica_10

       If you are using a grayscale monitor, try setting the colors to:

       XShogi*pieceColor:     gray100
       XShogi*squareColor:    gray60

COMMAND BUTTONS AND KEYS
       Quit    Quits xshogi.  Q or q is a keyboard equivalent.

       Reset   Resets xshogi to the beginning of a shogi game.  It also
               deselects any game or position files.

       Flip View
               inverts the view of the shogi board.

       Hint    displays a move hint from gnushogi.

       Load Game
               plays a game from a record file.  If no file is specified a
               popup dialog asks for a filename.  Game files are found in the
               directory named by the SHOGIDIR environment variable.  If this
               variable is not declared then the current directory is used
               unless the file name starts with a /.  G or g is a keyboard
               equivalent.  The game file parser will accept almost any file
               that contains moves in algebraic notation.  If the first line
               begins with `#', it is assumed to be a title and is displayed.
               Text enclosed in parentheses or square brackets is assumed to
               be commentary and is displayed in a pop-up window.  Any other
               text in the file is ignored.

       Load Position
               sets up a position from a position file.  If no file is
               specified a popup dialog asks for a filename.  Position files
               are found in the directory named by the SHOGIDIR environment
               variable.  If this variable is not declared then the current
               directory is used unless the file name starts with a /.
               Position files must be in the format that the Save Position
               command writes.

       Save Game
               saves a game to a record file.  If no file is specified a popup
               dialog asks for a filename.  If the filename exists, the user
               is asked whether the current game record is be appended to this
               file or if the file should be replaced.  Game files are saved
               in the directory named by the SHOGIDIR environment variable.
               If this variable is not declared then the current directory is
               used unless the file name starts with a /.  Game files are
               human-readable, and can also be read back by the Load Game
               command. Furthermore, they are accepted as gnushogi text
               bookfiles.

       Save Position
               saves a position to a position file.  If no file is specified a
               popup dialog asks for a filename.  Position files are saved in
               the directory named by the SHOGIDIR environment variable.  If
               this variable is not declared then the current directory is
               used unless the file name starts with a /.  Position files are
               human-readable, and can also be read back by the Load Position
               command.

       Machine White
               forces gnushogi to play white.

       Machine Black
               forces gnushogi to play black.

       Force Moves
               forces a series of moves.  That is, gnushogi stops playing and
               xshogi allows you to make moves for both white and black.

       Two Machines
               plays a game between two computer programs.

       Forward moves forward through a series of remembered moves.  F or f is
               a keyboard equivalent.

       Backward
               moves backward through a series of remembered moves.  As a side
               effect, puts xshogi into Force Moves mode.  B or b is a
               keyboard equivalent.

       Pause   pauses the clocks or (in Load Game mode) pauses the game being
               loaded.  Press Pause again to continue.  P or p is a keyboard
               equivalent.

       Edit Position
               lets you set up an arbitrary board position.  Use mouse button
               1 to drag pieces to new squares, or to delete a piece by
               dragging it off the board or dragging an empty square on top of
               it.  To drop a new piece on a square, press mouse button 2 or 3
               over the square.  This brings up a menu of black pieces (button
               2) or white pieces (button 3).  Additional menu choices let you
               empty the square or clear the board.  You can set the side to
               play next by clicking on the Black or White indicator at the
               top of the screen.

       Challenge
               allows you to make a two display game between two human
               players.  Enter the display you want to connect to. If you are
               allowed to connect, a new board is displayed at the remote
               display.  Challenge mode can only be stopped by pressing
               "quit".

       Select Level
               allows you to reset the clocks for both players.  Enter the
               number of moves and the number of minutes in which the moves

LIMITATIONS
       If you press the Pause button during gnushogi's turn, xshogi will stop
       the clocks, but gnushogi will still make a move.

       After a mate or draw when playing against gnushogi, if you back up with
       the Backward button, the clocks are reset (because gnushogi has exited
       and must be restarted).

       Some xshogi functions may not work with versions of gnushogi earlier
       than 1.1, patchlevel 02.

       The game parser recognizes only algebraic notation.
