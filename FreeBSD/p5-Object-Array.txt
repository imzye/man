NAME
       Object::Array - array references with accessors

VERSION
       Version 0.060

SYNOPSIS
         use Object::Array qw(Array);
         my $array = Object::Array->new;       # or
         $array = Object::Array->new(\@array); # or
         $array = Array(\@array);
         $array->push(1..5);
         print $array->shift;
         $_++ for grep { $_ < 4 } @{ $array };
         $array->[0] = "a pony";

IMPORTANT NOTE
       Several of these methods do not behave exactly like their builtin
       counterparts.

       Specifically, any method that you would expect to return a list does
       so, but only in list context.  In scalar context, these methods will
       return an Object::Array object constructed from a copy of the list that
       would have been returned.

       This sounds more complicated than it is.  It means that you can chain
       some methods together, e.g.

         $arr->grep(sub { defined })->[-1];

       instead of the more bracing

         ${ $arr->grep(sub { defined }) }[-1];

       Currently, these array objects only contain copies of the original
       values.  In the future, they will retain references to the original
       object, and this sort of thing will be possible:

         $arr->grep(sub { defined })->[-1]++;

METHODS
   new
         my $array = Object::Array->new;
         # or use existing array
         my $array = Object::Array->new(\@a);

       Creates a new array object, either from scratch or from an existing
       array.

       Using an existing array will mean that any changes to $array also
       affect the original array object.  If you don't want that, copy the
       data first or use something like Storable's "dclone".

   isa
       Overridden to respond to 'ARRAY'.

   ref
       Returns a reference to the underlying array.
