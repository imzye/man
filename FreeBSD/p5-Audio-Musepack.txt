NAME
       Audio::APE - An object-oriented interface to Monkey's Audio file
       information and APE tag fields.

SYNOPSIS
           use Audio::APE;
           my $mac = Audio::APE->new("song.ape");

           foreach (keys %$mac) {
               print "$_: $mac->{$_}\n";
           }

           my $macTags = $mac->tags();

           foreach (keys %$macTags) {
               print "$_: $macTags->{$_}\n";
           }

DESCRIPTION
       This module returns a hash containing basic information about a
       Monkey's Audio file, as well as tag information contained in the
       Monkey's Audio file's APE tags.

CONSTRUCTORS
       •   new( $filename )

           Opens a Monkey's Audio file, ensuring that it exists and is
           actually an Monkey's Audio stream, then loads the information and
           comment fields.

INSTANCE METHODS
       •   info( [$key] )

           Returns a hashref containing information about the Monkey's Audio
           file from the file's information header.

           The optional parameter, key, allows you to retrieve a single value
           from the info hash.  Returns "undef" if the key is not found.

       •   tags( [$key] )

           Returns a hashref containing tag keys and values of the Monkey's
           Audio file from the file's APE tags.

           The optional parameter, key, allows you to retrieve a single value
           from the tag hash.  Returns "undef" if the key is not found.

NOTE
       This module is now a wrapper around Audio::Scan.
