DESCRIPTION
       miniupnpd act as a UPnP Internet Gateway Device. It is designed to run
       on the gateway between the internet and a NAT'ed LAN. It provides an
       interface, as defined in the UPnP standard, for enabling clients on the
       LAN to ask for port redirections.

       -N     enable NAT-PMP and PCP functionality.

       -u uuid
              set the uuid of the UPnP Internet Gateway Device.

       -s serial
              serial number for the UPnP Internet Gateway Device.

       -m model_number
              model number for the UPnP Internet Gateway Device.

       -t notify_interval
              SSDP notify interval in seconds. Default is 900 seconds. SSDP
              announce messages will be broadcasted at this interval.

       -P pid_filename
              pid file. default is /var/run/miniupnpd.pid

       -B down up
              download and upload bitrates reported to clients.

       -w url presentation url. default is first address on LAN, port 80.

       -r clean_ruleset_interval
              (minimum) interval between unused rules cleaning checks.

       -A permission rule
              use following syntax for permission rules :

       -b BOOTID
              sets the value of BOOTID.UPNP.ORG SSDP header
