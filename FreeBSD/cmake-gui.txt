NAME
       cmake-gui - CMake GUI Command-Line Reference

SYNOPSIS

          cmake-gui [<options>]
          cmake-gui [<options>] -B <path-to-build> [-S <path-to-source>]
          cmake-gui [<options>] <path-to-source | path-to-existing-build>
          cmake-gui [<options>] --browse-manual [<filename>]

DESCRIPTION
       The cmake-gui executable is the CMake GUI.  Project configuration
       settings may be specified interactively.  Brief instructions are
       provided at the bottom of the window when the program is running.

       CMake is a cross-platform build system generator.  Projects specify
       their build process with platform-independent CMake listfiles included
       in each directory of a source tree with the name CMakeLists.txt.  Users
       build a project by using CMake to generate a build system for a native
       tool on their platform.

OPTIONS

       -S <path-to-source>
              Path to root directory of the CMake project to build.

       -B <path-to-build>
              Path to directory which CMake will use as the root of build
              directory.

              If the directory doesn't already exist CMake will make it.

       --preset=<preset-name>
              Name of the preset to use from the project's presets files, if
              it has them.

       --browse-manual [<filename>]
              Open the CMake reference manual in a browser and immediately
              exit. If <filename> is specified, open that file within the
              reference manual instead of index.html.

       -version [<file>], --version [<file>], /V [<file>]
              Show program name/version banner and exit.  The output is
              printed to a named <file> if given.

       -h, -H, --help, -help, -usage, /?
              Print usage information and exit.

              Usage describes the basic command line interface and its
              options.

       --help <keyword> [<file>]
              Print help for one CMake keyword.

              <keyword> can be a property, variable, command, policy,

              human-readable text format.  The output is printed to a named
