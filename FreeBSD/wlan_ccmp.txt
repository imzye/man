WLAN_CCMP(4)           FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual           WLAN_CCMP(4)

NAME
     wlan_ccmp – AES-CCMP crypto support for 802.11 devices

SYNOPSIS
     device wlan_ccmp

DESCRIPTION
     The wlan_ccmp module handles the AES-CCMP cryptographic requirements of
     the WPA and 802.11i protocols.  It does encapsulation and decapsulation
     of CCMP-encoded 802.11 frames and optionally calculates the AES-CCMP
     cipher.  The wlan_ccmp module is an 802.11 cryptographic plugin module
     for use by the wlan(4) module.  This module is automatically loaded if an
     AES-CCMP key is configured; typically by a WPA supplicant program such as
     wpa_supplicant, or a WPA authenticator program such as hostapd.  Should
     the underlying network device not be capable of doing the AES-CCMP
     calculations in hardware, the wlan_ccmp module will do the work.

     Standards.

HISTORY
