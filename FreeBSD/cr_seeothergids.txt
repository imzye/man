CR_SEEOTHERGIDS(9)     FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual    CR_SEEOTHERGIDS(9)

NAME
     cr_seeothergids – determine visibility of objects given their group
     memberships

SYNOPSIS
     int
     cr_seeothergids(struct ucred *u1, struct ucred *u2);

DESCRIPTION
     This function determines the visibility of objects in the kernel based on
     the group IDs in the credentials u1 and u2 associated with them.

     The visibility of objects is influenced by the sysctl(8) variable
     security.bsd.see_other_gids.  If this variable is non-zero then all
     objects in the kernel are visible to each other irrespective of their
     group membership.  If this variable is zero then the object with
     credentials u2 is visible to the object with credentials u1 if either u1
     is the super-user credential, or if at least one of u1's group IDs is
     present in u2's group set.

SYSCTL VARIABLES
     security.bsd.see_other_gids
             Must be non-zero if objects with unprivileged credentials are to
             be able to see each other.

RETURN VALUES
     This function returns zero if the object with credential u1 can “see” the
     object with credential u2, or ESRCH otherwise.
