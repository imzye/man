Test::HTTP::Server::Simple(3)              User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Test::HTTP::Server::Simple - Test::More functions for
       HTTP::Server::Simple

SYNOPSIS
           package My::WebServer;
           use base qw/Test::HTTP::Server::Simple HTTP::Server::Simple/;

           package main;
           use Test::More tests => 42;

           my $s = My::WebServer->new;

           my $url_root = $s->started_ok("start up my web server);

           # connect to "$url_root/cool/site" and test with Test::WWW::Mechanize,
           # Test::HTML::Tidy, etc

DESCRIPTION
       This mixin class provides methods to test an HTTP::Server::Simple-based
       web server.  Currently, it provides only one such method: "started_ok".

   started_ok [$text]
       "started_ok" takes an optional test description.  The server needs to
       have been configured (specifically, its port needs to have been set),
       but it should not have been run or backgrounded.  "started_ok" calls
       "background" on the server, which forks it to run in the background.
       Test::HTTP::Server::Simple takes care of killing the server when your
       test script dies, even if you kill your test script with an interrupt.
       "started_ok" returns the URL "http://localhost:$port" which you can use
       to connect to your server.

       Note that if the child process dies, or never gets around to listening
       for connections, this just hangs.  (This may be fixed in a future
       version.)

       Also, it probably won't work if you use a custom Net::Server in your
       server.

   pids
       Returns the PIDs of the processes which have been started.  Since
       multiple test servers can be running at one, be aware that this returns
       a list.

DEPENDENCIES
       Test::Builder, HTTP::Server::Simple, NEXT.

INCOMPATIBILITIES
       None reported.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       Installs an interrupt signal handler, which may override any that
       another part of your program has installed.
