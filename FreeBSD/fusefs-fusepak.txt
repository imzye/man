PAKMOUNT(1)             FreeBSD General Commands Manual            PAKMOUNT(1)



NAME
       pakmount - mount various file formats

SYNOPSIS
       pakmount file mountpoint [<options>] [<FUSE options>]

DESCRIPTION
       Pakmount is used to mount file under mountpoint using FUSE system
       available under FreeBSD. The mountpoint should be empty and file should
       be one of the supported formats. To unmount mountpoint use fusermount
       -u mountpoint.

SUPPORTED FILE FORMATS
       WAD - it can be found in Wolfenstein 3D and Spear of Destiny games.

       PACK - it can be found in Quake, Quake2 and other games based on
       idSoftware's Quake engine.

       WAD2 - it can be found inside of PACK files.

       LGP - it can be found in PC version of Final Fantasy VII.

       PAK - it can be found in Dune 2.

       KSGRP - it can be found in Duke Nukem 3D.

OPTIONS
       -q - quiet mode (print only error messages).

BUGS
       Some archives (mainly LGP) can contain many files with the same name.
       It confuses pakmount a bit, but you can still read the first file with
       such name (and only the first one).
