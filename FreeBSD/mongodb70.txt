mongod(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              mongod(1)

MONGOD
SYNOPSIS
       mongod is the primary daemon process for the MongoDB system. It handles
       data requests, manages data access, and performs background management
       operations.

       This document provides a complete overview of all command line options
       for mongod. These command line options are primarily useful for
       testing: In common operation, use the configuration file options to
       control the behavior of your database.

       Configuration File Settings and Command-Line Options Mapping

       MongoDB disables support for TLS 1.0 encryption on systems where TLS
       1.1+ is available. For more details, see Disable TLS 1.0.

OPTIONS

              • MongoDB always enables journaling. As a result, MongoDB
                removes the storage.journal.enabled option and the
                corresponding --journal and --nojournal command-line options.

              • MongoDB removes the --cpu command-line option.

              • MongoDB removes the --serviceExecutor command-line option and
                the corresponding net.serviceExecutor configuration option.

              • MongoDB removes the --noIndexBuildRetry command-line option
                and the corresponding storage.indexBuildRetry option.

              • MongoDB deprecates the SSL options and instead adds new
                corresponding TLS options.

              • MongoDB adds --tlsClusterCAFile/net.tls.clusterCAFile.

   CORE OPTIONS
       mongod --help, mongod -h

              Returns information on the options and use of mongod.

       mongod --version

              Returns the mongod release number.

       mongod --config, mongod -f

              Specifies a configuration file for runtime configuration
              options. The configuration file is the preferred method for
              runtime configuration of mongod. The options are equivalent to
              the command-line configuration options. See Configuration File
              Options for more information.

              Ensure the configuration file uses ASCII encoding. The mongod
              instance does not support configuration files with non-ASCII
              encoding, including UTF-8.

       mongod --configExpand

              Default: none

              Enables using Expansion Directives in configuration files.
              Expansion directives allow you to set externally sourced values
              for configuration file options.

              --configExpand supports the following expansion directives:

                     •

                       •   Value

                       •   Description

                     •

                       •   none

                       •   Default. mongod does not expand expansion
                           directives.  mongod fails to start if any
                           configuration file settings use expansion
                           directives.

                     •

                       •   rest

                       •   mongod expands __rest expansion directives when
                           parsing the configuration file.

                     •

                       •   exec

                       •   mongod expands __exec expansion directives when
                           parsing the configuration file.

              You can specify multiple expansion directives as a
              comma-separated list, e.g. rest, exec. If the configuration file
              contains expansion directives not specified to --configExpand,
              the mongod returns an error and terminates.

              See Externally Sourced Configuration File Values for
              configuration files for more information on expansion
              directives.

       mongod --verbose, mongod -v

              Increases the amount of internal reporting returned on standard
              output or in log files. Increase the verbosity with the -v form
              by including the option multiple times, (e.g. -vvvvv.)

              Starting in version 4.2, MongoDB includes the Debug verbosity
              level (1-5) in the log messages. For example, if the verbosity
              level is 2, MongoDB logs D2. In previous versions, MongoDB log
              messages only specified D for Debug level.

       mongod --quiet

              Runs mongod in a quiet mode that attempts to limit the amount of
              output.

              This option suppresses:

                     • output from database commands

                     • replication activity

                     • connection accepted events

                     • connection closed events

       mongod --port

              Default:

                     • 27017 if mongod is not a shard member or a config
                       server member

                     • 27018 if mongod is a shard member

                     • 27019 if mongod is a config server member

              The TCP port on which the MongoDB instance listens for client
              connections.

       mongod --bind_ip

              Default: localhost

              The hostnames and/or IP addresses and/or full Unix domain socket
              paths on which mongod should listen for client connections. You
              may attach mongod to any interface. To bind to multiple
              addresses, enter a list of comma-separated values.

              You can specify both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, or hostnames that
              resolve to an IPv4 or IPv6 address.

              If specifying an IPv6 address or a hostname that resolves to an
              IPv6 address to --bind_ip, you must start mongod with --ipv6 to
              enable IPv6 support. Specifying an IPv6 address to --bind_ip
              does not enable IPv6 support.

              If specifying a link-local IPv6 address
              (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-local_address#IPv6)
              (fe80::/10), you must append the zone index
              (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_address#Scoped_literal_IPv6_addresses_(with_zone_index))
              to that address (i.e. fe80::<address>%<adapter-name>).

              To avoid configuration updates due to IP address changes, use
              DNS hostnames instead of IP addresses. It is particularly
              important to use a DNS hostname instead of an IP address when
              configuring replica set members or sharded cluster members.

              Use hostnames instead of IP addresses to configure clusters
              across a split network horizon. Starting in MongoDB 5.0, nodes
              that are only configured with an IP address will fail startup
              validation and will not start.

              Before you bind your instance to a publicly-accessible IP
              address, you must secure your cluster from unauthorized access.
              For a complete list of security recommendations, see Security
              Checklist. At minimum, consider enabling authentication and
              hardening network infrastructure.

              For more information about IP Binding, refer to the IP Binding
              documentation.

              To bind to all IPv4 addresses, enter 0.0.0.0.

              To bind to all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, enter ::,0.0.0.0 or
              starting in MongoDB 4.2, an asterisk "*" (enclose the asterisk
              in quotes to avoid filename pattern expansion). Alternatively,
              use the net.bindIpAll setting.

                     • --bind_ip and --bind_ip_all are mutually exclusive.
                       Specifying both options causes mongod to throw an error
                       and terminate.

                     • The command-line option --bind overrides the
                       configuration file setting net.bindIp.

       mongod --bind_ip_all

              If specified, the mongod instance binds to all IPv4 addresses
              (i.e. 0.0.0.0). If mongod starts with --ipv6, --bind_ip_all also
              binds to all IPv6 addresses (i.e. ::).

              mongod only supports IPv6 if started with --ipv6. Specifying
              --bind_ip_all alone does not enable IPv6 support.

              Before you bind your instance to a publicly-accessible IP
              address, you must secure your cluster from unauthorized access.
              For a complete list of security recommendations, see Security
              Checklist. At minimum, consider enabling authentication and
              hardening network infrastructure.

              For more information about IP Binding, refer to the IP Binding
              documentation.

              Alternatively, you can set the --bind_ip option to ::,0.0.0.0
              or, starting in MongoDB 4.2, to an asterisk "*" (enclose the
              asterisk in quotes to avoid filename pattern expansion).

              --bind_ip and --bind_ip_all are mutually exclusive. That is, you
              can specify one or the other, but not both.

       mongod --clusterIpSourceAllowlist

              A list of IP addresses/CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing
              (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4632)) ranges against which the
              mongod validates authentication requests from other members of
              the replica set and, if part of a sharded cluster, the mongos
              instances. The mongod verifies that the originating IP is either
              explicitly in the list or belongs to a CIDR range in the list.
              If the IP address is not present, the server does not
              authenticate the mongod or mongos.

              --clusterIpSourceAllowlist has no effect on a mongod started
              without authentication.

              --clusterIpSourceAllowlist accepts multiple comma-separated
              IPv4/6 addresses or Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR
              (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4632)) ranges:

                mongod --clusterIpSourceAllowlist 192.0.2.0/24,127.0.0.1,::1

              Ensure --clusterIpSourceAllowlist includes the IP address or
              CIDR ranges that include the IP address of each replica set
              member or mongos in the deployment to ensure healthy
              communication between cluster components.

       mongod --clusterIpSourceWhitelist

              Deprecated in version 5.0: Use --clusterIpSourceAllowlist
              instead.

              A list of IP addresses/CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing
              (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4632)) ranges against which the
              mongod validates authentication requests from other members of
              the replica set and, if part of a sharded cluster, the mongos
              instances. The mongod verifies that the originating IP is either
              explicitly in the list or belongs to a CIDR range in the list.
              If the IP address is not present, the server does not
              authenticate the mongod or mongos.

              --clusterIpSourceWhitelist has no effect on a mongod started
              without authentication.

              --clusterIpSourceWhitelist accepts multiple comma-separated
              IPv4/6 addresses or Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR
              (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4632)) ranges:

                mongod --clusterIpSourceWhitelist 192.0.2.0/24,127.0.0.1,::1

              Ensure --clusterIpSourceWhitelist includes the IP address or
              CIDR ranges that include the IP address of each replica set
              member or mongos in the deployment to ensure healthy
              communication between cluster components.

       mongod --ipv6

              Enables IPv6 support. mongod disables IPv6 support by default.

              Setting --ipv6 does not direct the mongod to listen on any local
              IPv6 addresses or interfaces. To configure the mongod to listen
              on an IPv6 interface, you must either:

                     • Configure --bind_ip with one or more IPv6 addresses or
                       hostnames that resolve to IPv6 addresses, or

                     • Set --bind_ip_all to true.

       mongod --listenBacklog

              Default: Target system SOMAXCONN constant

              The maximum number of connections that can exist in the listen
              queue.

              Consult your local system's documentation to understand the
              limitations and configuration requirements before using this
              parameter.

              To prevent undefined behavior, specify a value for this
              parameter between 1 and the local system SOMAXCONN constant.

              The default value for the listenBacklog parameter is set at
              compile time to the target system SOMAXCONN constant.  SOMAXCONN
              is the maximum valid value that is documented for the backlog
              parameter to the listen system call.

              Some systems may interpret SOMAXCONN symbolically, and others
              numerically. The actual listen backlog applied in practice may
              differ from any numeric interpretation of the SOMAXCONN constant
              or argument to --listenBacklog, and may also be constrained by
              system settings like net.core.somaxconn on Linux.

              Passing a value for the listenBacklog parameter that exceeds the
              SOMAXCONN constant for the local system is, by the letter of the
              standards, undefined behavior. Higher values may be silently
              integer truncated, may be ignored, may cause unexpected resource
              consumption, or have other adverse consequences.

              On systems with workloads that exhibit connection spikes, for
              which it is empirically known that the local system can honor
              higher values for the backlog parameter than the SOMAXCONN
              constant, setting the listenBacklog parameter to a higher value
              may reduce operation latency as observed by the client by
              reducing the number of connections which are forced into a
              backoff state.

       mongod --maxConns

              The maximum number of simultaneous connections that mongod will
              accept. This setting has no effect if it is higher than your
              operating system's configured maximum connection tracking
              threshold.

              Do not assign too low of a value to this option, or you will
              encounter errors during normal application operation.

       mongod --logpath

              Sends all diagnostic logging information to a log file instead
              of to standard output or to the host's syslog system. MongoDB
              creates the log file at the path you specify.

              By default, MongoDB will move any existing log file rather than
              overwrite it. To instead append to the log file, set the
              --logappend option.

       mongod --syslog

              Sends all logging output to the host's syslog system rather than
              to standard output or to a log file (--logpath).

              The --syslog option is not supported on Windows.

              The syslog daemon generates timestamps when it logs a message,
              not when MongoDB issues the message. This can lead to misleading
              timestamps for log entries, especially when the system is under
              heavy load. We recommend using the --logpath option for
              production systems to ensure accurate timestamps.

              Starting in version 4.2, MongoDB includes the component in its
              log messages to syslog.

                ...  ACCESS   [repl writer worker 5] Unsupported modification to roles collection ...

       mongod --syslogFacility

              Default: user

              Specifies the facility level used when logging messages to
              syslog.  The value you specify must be supported by your
              operating system's implementation of syslog. To use this option,
              you must  enable the --syslog option.

       mongod --logappend

              Appends new entries to the end of the existing log file when the
              mongod instance restarts. Without this option, mongod will back
              up the existing log and create a new file.

       mongod --logRotate

              Default: rename

              Determines the behavior for the logRotate command when rotating
              the server log and/or the audit log. Specify either rename or
              reopen:

                     • rename renames the log file.

                     • reopen closes and reopens the log file following the
                       typical Linux/Unix log rotate behavior. Use reopen when
                       using the Linux/Unix logrotate utility to avoid log
                       loss.

                       If you specify reopen, you must also use --logappend.

       mongod --timeStampFormat

              Default: iso8601-local

              The time format for timestamps in log messages. Specify one of
              the following values:

                     •

                       •   Value

                       •   Description

                     •

                       •   iso8601-utc

                       •   Displays timestamps in Coordinated Universal Time
                           (UTC) in the ISO-8601 format. For example, for New
                           York at the start of the Epoch:
                           1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z

                     •

                       •   iso8601-local

                       •   Displays timestamps in local time in the ISO-8601
                           format. For example, for New York at the start of
                           the Epoch: 1969-12-31T19:00:00.000-05:00

              Starting in MongoDB 4.4, --timeStampFormat no longer supports
              ctime.  An example of ctime formatted date is: Wed Dec 31
              18:17:54.811.

       mongod --traceExceptions

              For internal diagnostic use only.

       mongod --pidfilepath

              Specifies a file location to store the process ID (PID) of the
              mongod process. The user running the mongod or mongos process
              must be able to write to this path. If the --pidfilepath option
              is not specified, the process does not create a PID file. This
              option is generally only useful in combination with the --fork
              option.

              On Linux, PID file management is generally the responsibility of
              your distro's init system: usually a service file in the
              /etc/init.d directory, or a systemd unit file registered with
              systemctl. Only use the --pidfilepath option if you are not
              using one of these init systems. For more information, please
              see the respective Installation Guide for your operating system.

              On macOS, PID file management is generally handled by brew. Only
              use the --pidfilepath option if you are not using brew on your
              macOS system.  For more information, please see the respective
              Installation Guide for your operating system.

       mongod --keyFile

              Specifies the path to a key file that stores the shared secret
              that MongoDB instances use to authenticate to each other in a
              sharded cluster or replica set. --keyFile implies --auth. See
              Internal/Membership Authentication for more information.

              Starting in MongoDB 4.2, keyfiles for internal membership
              authentication use YAML format to allow for multiple keys in a
              keyfile. The YAML format accepts either:

                     • A single key string (same as in earlier versions)

                     • A sequence of key strings

              The YAML format is compatible with the existing single-key
              keyfiles that use the text file format.

       mongod --setParameter

              Specifies one of the MongoDB parameters described in MongoDB
              Server Parameters. You can specify multiple setParameter fields.

       mongod --nounixsocket

              Disables listening on the UNIX domain socket. --nounixsocket
              applies only to Unix-based systems.

              The mongod process always listens on the UNIX socket unless one
              of the following is true:

                     • --nounixsocket is set

                     • net.bindIp is not set

                     • net.bindIp does not specify localhost or its associated
                       IP address

              mongod installed from official .deb and .rpm packages have the
              bind_ip configuration set to 127.0.0.1 by default.

       mongod --unixSocketPrefix

              Default: /tmp

              The path for the UNIX socket. --unixSocketPrefix applies only to
              Unix-based systems.

              If this option has no value, the mongod process creates a socket
              with /tmp as a prefix. MongoDB creates and listens on a UNIX
              socket unless one of the following is true:

                     • net.unixDomainSocket.enabled is false

                     • --nounixsocket is set

                     • net.bindIp is not set

                     • net.bindIp does not specify localhost or its associated
                       IP address

       mongod --filePermissions

              Default: 0700

              Sets the permission for the UNIX domain socket file.

              --filePermissions applies only to Unix-based systems.

       mongod --fork

              Enables a daemon mode that runs the mongod process in the
              background. By default mongod does not run as a daemon:
              typically you will run mongod as a daemon, either by using
              --fork or by using a controlling process that handles the
              daemonization process (e.g. as with upstart and systemd).

              Using the --fork option requires that you configure log output
              for the mongod with one of the following:

                     • --logpath

                     • --syslog

              The --fork option is not supported on Windows.

       mongod --auth

              Enables authorization to control user's access to database
              resources and operations. When authorization is enabled, MongoDB
              requires all clients to authenticate themselves first in order
              to determine the access for the client.

              To configure users, use the mongosh client. If no users exist,
              the localhost interface will continue to have access to the
              database until you create the first user.

              See Security for more information.

       mongod --noauth

              Disables authentication. Currently the default. Exists for
              future compatibility and clarity.

       mongod --transitionToAuth

              Allows the mongod to accept and create authenticated and
              non-authenticated connections to and from other mongod and
              mongos instances in the deployment. Used for performing rolling
              transition of replica sets or sharded clusters from a no-auth
              configuration to internal authentication. Requires specifying a
              internal authentication mechanism such as --keyFile.

              For example, if using keyfiles for internal authentication, the
              mongod creates an authenticated connection with any mongod or
              mongos in the deployment using a matching keyfile. If the
              security mechanisms do not match, the mongod utilizes a
              non-authenticated connection instead.

              A mongod running with --transitionToAuth does not enforce user
              access controls. Users may connect to your deployment without
              any access control checks and perform read, write, and
              administrative operations.

              A mongod running with internal authentication and without
              --transitionToAuth requires clients to connect using user access
              controls. Update clients to connect to the mongod using the
              appropriate user prior to restarting mongod without
              --transitionToAuth.

       mongod --sysinfo

              Returns diagnostic system information and then exits. The
              information provides the page size, the number of physical
              pages, and the number of available physical pages.

       mongod --noscripting

              Disables the scripting engine.

       mongod --notablescan

              Forbids operations that require a collection scan. See
              notablescan for additional information.

       mongod --shutdown

              The --shutdown option cleanly and safely terminates the mongod
              process. When invoking mongod with this option you must set the
              --dbpath option either directly or by way of the configuration
              file and the --config option.

              The --shutdown option is available only on Linux systems.

              For additional ways to shut down, see also Stop mongod
              Processes.

       mongod --redactClientLogData

              Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.

              A mongod running with --redactClientLogData redacts any message
              accompanying a given log event before logging. This prevents the
              mongod from writing potentially sensitive data stored on the
              database to the diagnostic log.  Metadata such as error or
              operation codes, line numbers, and source file names are still
              visible in the logs.

              Use --redactClientLogData in conjunction with Encryption at Rest
              and TLS/SSL (Transport Encryption) to assist compliance with
              regulatory requirements.

              For example, a MongoDB deployment might store Personally
              Identifiable Information (PII) in one or more collections. The
              mongod logs events such as those related to CRUD operations,
              sharding metadata, etc. It is possible that the mongod may
              expose PII as a part of these logging operations. A mongod
              running with --redactClientLogData removes any message
              accompanying these events before being output to the log,
              effectively removing the PII.

              Diagnostics on a mongod running with --redactClientLogData may
              be more difficult due to the lack of data related to a log
              event. See the process logging manual page for an example of the
              effect of --redactClientLogData on log output.

              On a running mongod, use setParameter with the
              redactClientLogData parameter to configure this setting.

       mongod --networkMessageCompressors

              Default: snappy,zstd,zlib

              Specifies the default compressor(s) to use for communication
              between this mongod instance and:

                     • other members of the deployment if the instance is part
                       of a replica set or a sharded cluster

                     • mongosh

                     • drivers that support the OP_COMPRESSED message format.

              MongoDB supports the following compressors:

                     • snappy

                     • zlib

                     • zstd

              Both mongod and mongos instances default to snappy,zstd,zlib
              compressors, in that order.

              To disable network compression, set the value to disabled.

              Messages are compressed when both parties enable network
              compression. Otherwise, messages between the parties are
              uncompressed.

              If you specify multiple compressors, then the order in which you
              list the compressors matter as well as the communication
              initiator. For example, if mongosh specifies the following
              network compressors zlib,snappy and the mongod specifies
              snappy,zlib, messages between mongosh and mongod uses zlib.

              If the parties do not share at least one common compressor,
              messages between the parties are uncompressed. For example, if
              mongosh specifies the network compressor zlib and mongod
              specifies snappy, messages between mongosh and mongod are not
              compressed.

       mongod --timeZoneInfo

              The full path from which to load the time zone database. If this
              option is not provided, then MongoDB will use its built-in time
              zone database.

              The configuration file included with Linux and macOS packages
              sets the time zone database path to /usr/share/zoneinfo by
              default.

              The built-in time zone database is a copy of the Olson/IANA time
              zone database (https://www.iana.org/time-zones). It is updated
              along with MongoDB releases, but the time zone database release
              cycle differs from the MongoDB release cycle. The most recent
              release of the time zone database is available on our download
              site
              (https://downloads.mongodb.org/olson_tz_db/timezonedb-latest.zip).

                wget https://downloads.mongodb.org/olson_tz_db/timezonedb-latest.zip
                unzip timezonedb-latest.zip
                mongod --timeZoneInfo timezonedb-2017b/

              MongoDB uses the third party timelib
              (https://github.com/derickr/timelib) library to provide accurate
              conversions between timezones. Due to a recent update, timelib
              could create inaccurate time zone conversions in older versions
              of MongoDB.

              To explicitly link to the time zone database in versions of
              MongoDB prior to 5.0, 4.4.7, and 4.2.14, download the time zone
              database
              (https://downloads.mongodb.org/olson_tz_db/timezonedb-latest.zip).
              and use the timeZoneInfo parameter.

              processManagement.timeZoneInfo.

       mongod --outputConfig

              Outputs the mongod instance's configuration options, formatted
              in YAML, to stdout and exits the mongod instance. For
              configuration options that uses Externally Sourced Configuration
              File Values, --outputConfig returns the resolved value for those
              options.

              This may include any configured passwords or secrets previously
              obfuscated through the external source.

              For usage examples, see:

                     • Output the Configuration File with Resolved Expansion
                       Directive Values

   LDAP AUTHENTICATION OR AUTHORIZATION OPTIONS
       mongod --ldapServers

              Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.

              The LDAP server against which the mongod authenticates users or
              determines what actions a user is authorized to perform on a
              given database. If the LDAP server specified has any replicated
              instances, you may specify the host and port of each replicated
              server in a comma-delimited list.

              If your LDAP infrastructure partitions the LDAP directory over
              multiple LDAP servers, specify one LDAP server or any of its
              replicated instances to --ldapServers. MongoDB supports
              following LDAP referrals as defined in RFC 4511 4.1.10
              (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4511.txt). Do not use
              --ldapServers for listing every LDAP server in your
              infrastructure.

              This setting can be configured on a running mongod using
              setParameter.

              If unset, mongod cannot use LDAP authentication or
              authorization.

       mongod --ldapValidateLDAPServerConfig

              Available in MongoDB Enterprise

              A flag that determines if the mongod instance checks the
              availability of the LDAP server(s) as part of its startup:

                     • If true, the mongod instance performs the availability
                       check and only continues to start up if the LDAP server
                       is available.

                     • If false, the mongod instance skips the availability
                       check; i.e. the instance starts up even if the LDAP
                       server is unavailable.

       mongod --ldapQueryUser

              Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.

              The identity with which mongod binds as, when connecting to or
              performing queries on an LDAP server.

              Only required if any of the following are true:

                     • Using LDAP authorization.

                     • Using an LDAP query for username transformation.

                     • The LDAP server disallows anonymous binds

              You must use --ldapQueryUser with --ldapQueryPassword.

              If unset, mongod will not attempt to bind to the LDAP server.

              This setting can be configured on a running mongod using
              setParameter.

              Windows MongoDB deployments can use --ldapBindWithOSDefaults
              instead of --ldapQueryUser and --ldapQueryPassword. You cannot
              specify both --ldapQueryUser and --ldapBindWithOSDefaults at the
              same time.

       Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.

       The password used to bind to an LDAP server when using --ldapQueryUser.
       You must use --ldapQueryPassword with --ldapQueryUser.

       If not set, mongod does not attempt to bind to the LDAP server.

       You can configure this setting on a running mongod using setParameter.

       Starting in MongoDB 4.4, the ldapQueryPassword setParameter command
       accepts either a string or an array of strings. If ldapQueryPassword is
       set to an array, MongoDB tries each password in order until one
       succeeds. Use a password array to roll over the LDAP account password
       without downtime.

       Windows MongoDB deployments can use --ldapBindWithOSDefaults instead of
       --ldapQueryUser and --ldapQueryPassword.  You cannot specify both
       --ldapQueryPassword and --ldapBindWithOSDefaults at the same time.

       mongod --ldapBindWithOSDefaults

              Default: false

              Available in MongoDB Enterprise for the Windows platform only.

              Allows mongod to authenticate, or bind, using your Windows login
              credentials when connecting to the LDAP server.

              Only required if:

                     • Using LDAP authorization.

                     • Using an LDAP query for username transformation.

                     • The LDAP server disallows anonymous binds

              Use --ldapBindWithOSDefaults to replace --ldapQueryUser and
              --ldapQueryPassword.

       mongod --ldapBindMethod

              Default: simple

              Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.

              The method mongod uses to authenticate to an LDAP server.  Use
              with --ldapQueryUser and --ldapQueryPassword to connect to the
              LDAP server.

              --ldapBindMethod supports the following values:

                     • simple - mongod uses simple authentication.

                     • sasl - mongod uses SASL protocol for authentication

              If you specify sasl, you can configure the available SASL
              mechanisms using --ldapBindSaslMechanisms. mongod defaults to
              using DIGEST-MD5 mechanism.

       mongod --ldapBindSaslMechanisms

              Default: DIGEST-MD5

              Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.

              A comma-separated list of SASL mechanisms mongod can use when
              authenticating to the LDAP server. The mongod and the LDAP
              server must agree on at least one mechanism. The mongod
              dynamically loads any SASL mechanism libraries installed on the
              host machine at runtime.

              Install and configure the appropriate libraries for the selected
              SASL mechanism(s) on both the mongod host and the remote LDAP
              server host. Your operating system may include certain SASL
              libraries by default. Defer to the documentation associated with
              each SASL mechanism for guidance on installation and
              configuration.

              If using the GSSAPI SASL mechanism for use with Kerberos
              Authentication, verify the following for the mongod host
              machine:

              Linux

                            • The KRB5_CLIENT_KTNAME environment variable
                              resolves to the name of the client Linux Keytab
                              Files for the host machine. For more on Kerberos
                              environment variables, please defer to the
                              Kerberos documentation
                              (https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.13/doc/admin/env_variables.html).

                            • The client keytab includes a User Principal for
                              the mongod to use when connecting to the LDAP
                              server and execute LDAP queries.

              Windows

                     If connecting to an Active Directory server, the Windows
                     Kerberos configuration automatically generates a
                     Ticket-Granting-Ticket
                     (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa380510(v=vs.85).aspx)
                     when the user logs onto the system. Set
                     --ldapBindWithOSDefaults to true to allow mongod to use
                     the generated credentials when connecting to the Active
                     Directory server and execute queries.

              Set --ldapBindMethod to sasl to use this option.

       mongod --ldapTransportSecurity

              Default: tls

              Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.

              By default, mongod creates a TLS/SSL secured connection to the
              LDAP server.

              For Linux deployments, you must configure the appropriate TLS
              Options in /etc/openldap/ldap.conf file. Your operating system's
              package manager creates this file as part of the MongoDB
              Enterprise installation, via the libldap dependency. See the
              documentation for TLS Options in the ldap.conf OpenLDAP
              documentation
              (http://www.openldap.org/software/man.cgi?query=ldap.conf&manpath=OpenLDAP+2.4-Release)
              for more complete instructions.

              For Windows deployment, you must add the LDAP server CA
              certificates to the Windows certificate management tool. The
              exact name and functionality of the tool may vary depending on
              operating system version. Please see the documentation for your
              version of Windows for more information on certificate
              management.

              Set --ldapTransportSecurity to none to disable TLS/SSL between
              mongod and the LDAP server.

              Setting --ldapTransportSecurity to none transmits plaintext
              information and possibly credentials between mongod and the LDAP
              server.

       mongod --ldapTimeoutMS

              Default: 10000

              Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.

              The amount of time in milliseconds mongod should wait for an
              LDAP server to respond to a request.

              Increasing the value of --ldapTimeoutMS may prevent connection
              failure between the MongoDB server and the LDAP server, if the
              source of the failure is a connection timeout. Decreasing the
              value of --ldapTimeoutMS reduces the time MongoDB waits for a
              response from the LDAP server.

              This setting can be configured on a running mongod using
              setParameter.

       mongod --ldapRetryCount

              Default: 0

              Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.

              Number of operation retries by the server LDAP manager after a
              network error.

       mongod --ldapUserToDNMapping

              Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.

              Maps the username provided to mongod for authentication to a
              LDAP Distinguished Name (DN). You may need to use
              --ldapUserToDNMapping to transform a username into an LDAP DN in
              the following scenarios:

                     • Performing LDAP authentication with simple LDAP
                       binding, where users authenticate to MongoDB with
                       usernames that are not full LDAP DNs.

                     • Using an LDAP authorization query template that
                       requires a DN.

                     • Transforming the usernames of clients authenticating to
                       Mongo DB using different authentication mechanisms
                       (e.g. x.509, kerberos) to a full LDAP DN for
                       authorization.

              --ldapUserToDNMapping expects a quote-enclosed JSON-string
              representing an ordered array of documents. Each document
              contains a regular expression match and either a substitution or
              ldapQuery template used for transforming the incoming username.

              Each document in the array has the following form:

                {
                  match: "<regex>"
                  substitution: "<LDAP DN>" | ldapQuery: "<LDAP Query>"
                }

                     •

                       •   Field

                       •   Description

                       •   Example

                     •

                       •   match

                       •   An ECMAScript-formatted regular expression (regex)
                           to match against a provided username. Each
                           parenthesis-enclosed section represents a regex
                           capture group used by substitution or ldapQuery.

                       •   "(.+)ENGINEERING" "(.+)DBA"

                     •

                       •   substitution

                       •   An LDAP distinguished name (DN) formatting template
                           that converts the authentication name matched by
                           the match regex into a LDAP DN.  Each curly
                           bracket-enclosed numeric value is replaced by the
                           corresponding regex capture group
                           (http://www.regular-expressions.info/refcapture.html)
                           extracted from the authentication username via the
                           match regex.

                           The result of the substitution must be an RFC4514
                           (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4514.txt) escaped
                           string.

                       •   "cn={0},ou=engineering, dc=example,dc=com"

                     •

                       •   ldapQuery

                       •   A LDAP query formatting template that inserts the
                           authentication name matched by the match regex into
                           an LDAP query URI encoded respecting RFC4515 and
                           RFC4516. Each curly bracket-enclosed numeric value
                           is replaced by the corresponding regex capture
                           group
                           (http://www.regular-expressions.info/refcapture.html)
                           extracted from the authentication username via the
                           match expression.  mongod executes the query
                           against the LDAP server to retrieve the LDAP DN for
                           the authenticated user. mongod requires exactly one
                           returned result for the transformation to be
                           successful, or mongod skips this transformation.

                       •   "ou=engineering,dc=example, dc=com??one?(user={0})"

              An explanation of  RFC4514
              (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4514.txt), RFC4515
              (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4515), RFC4516
              (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4516), or LDAP queries is out of
              scope for the MongoDB Documentation. Please review the RFC
              directly or use your preferred LDAP resource.

              For each document in the array, you must use either substitution
              or ldapQuery. You cannot specify both in the same document.

              When performing authentication or authorization, mongod steps
              through each document in the array in the given order, checking
              the authentication username against the match filter.  If a
              match is found, mongod applies the transformation and uses the
              output for authenticating the user. mongod does not check the
              remaining documents in the array.

              If the given document does not match the provided authentication
              name, mongod continues through the list of documents to find
              additional matches. If no matches are found in any document, or
              the transformation the document describes fails, mongod returns
              an error.

              Starting in MongoDB 4.4, mongod also returns an error if one of
              the transformations cannot be evaluated due to networking or
              authentication failures to the LDAP server. mongod rejects the
              connection request and does not check the remaining documents in
              the array.

              Starting in MongoDB 5.0, --ldapUserToDNMapping accepts an empty
              string "" or empty array [ ] in place of a mapping documnent. If
              providing an empty string or empty array to
              --ldapUserToDNMapping, MongoDB will map the authenticated
              username as the LDAP DN. Previously, providing an empty mapping
              document would cause mapping to fail.

              The following shows two transformation documents. The first
              document matches against any string ending in @ENGINEERING,
              placing anything preceeding the suffix into a regex capture
              group. The second document matches against any string ending in
              @DBA, placing anything preceeding the suffix into a regex
              capture group.

                "[
                   {
                      match: "(.+)@ENGINEERING.EXAMPLE.COM",
                      substitution: "cn={0},ou=engineering,dc=example,dc=com"
                   },
                   {
                      match: "(.+)@DBA.EXAMPLE.COM",
                      ldapQuery: "ou=dba,dc=example,dc=com??one?(user={0})"

                   }

                ]"

              A user with username alice@ENGINEERING.EXAMPLE.COM matches the
              first document. The regex capture group {0} corresponds to the
              string alice. The resulting output is the DN
              "cn=alice,ou=engineering,dc=example,dc=com".

              A user with username bob@DBA.EXAMPLE.COM matches the second
              document.  The regex capture group {0} corresponds to the string
              bob.  The resulting output is the LDAP query
              "ou=dba,dc=example,dc=com??one?(user=bob)". mongod executes this
              query against the LDAP server, returning the result
              "cn=bob,ou=dba,dc=example,dc=com".

              If --ldapUserToDNMapping is unset, mongod applies no
              transformations to the username when attempting to authenticate
              or authorize a user against the LDAP server.

              This setting can be configured on a running mongod using the
              setParameter database command.

       mongod --ldapAuthzQueryTemplate

              Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.

              A relative LDAP query URL formatted conforming to RFC4515
              (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4515) and RFC4516
              (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4516) that mongod executes to
              obtain the LDAP groups to which the authenticated user belongs
              to. The query is relative to the host or hosts specified in
              --ldapServers.

              In the URL, you can use the following substituion tokens:

                     •

                       •   Substitution Token

                       •   Description

                     •

                       •   {USER}

                       •   Substitutes the authenticated username, or the
                           transformed username if a username mapping is
                           specified.

                     •

                       •   {PROVIDED_USER}

                       •   Substitutes the supplied username, i.e. before
                           either authentication or LDAP transformation.

              When constructing the query URL, ensure that the order of LDAP
              parameters respects RFC4516:

                [ dn  [ ? [attributes] [ ? [scope] [ ? [filter] [ ? [Extensions] ] ] ] ] ]

              If your query includes an attribute, mongod assumes that the
              query retrieves a the DNs which this entity is member of.

              If your query does not include an attribute, mongod assumes the
              query retrieves all entities which the user is member of.

              For each LDAP DN returned by the query, mongod assigns the
              authorized user a corresponding role on the admin database. If a
              role on the on the admin database exactly matches the DN, mongod
              grants the user the roles and privileges assigned to that role.
              See the db.createRole() method for more information on creating
              roles.

              This LDAP query returns any groups listed in the LDAP user
              object's memberOf attribute.

                "{USER}?memberOf?base"

              Your LDAP configuration may not include the memberOf attribute
              as part of the user schema, may possess a different attribute
              for reporting group membership, or may not track group
              membership through attributes.  Configure your query with
              respect to your own unique LDAP configuration.

              If unset, mongod cannot authorize users using LDAP.

              This setting can be configured on a running mongod using the
              setParameter database command.

   STORAGE OPTIONS
       mongod --storageEngine

              Default: wiredTiger

              Starting in version 4.2, MongoDB removes the deprecated MMAPv1
              storage engine.

              Specifies the storage engine for the mongod database. Available
              values include:

                     •

                       •   Value

                       •   Description

                     •

                       •   wiredTiger

                       •   To specify the WiredTiger Storage Engine.

                     •

                       •   inMemory

                       •   To specify the In-Memory Storage Engine.

                           Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.

              If you attempt to start a mongod with a --dbpath that contains
              data files produced by a storage engine other than the one
              specified by --storageEngine, mongod will refuse to start.

       mongod --dbpath

              Default: /data/db on Linux and macOS, atab on Windows

              The directory where the mongod instance stores its data.

              If using the default Configuration File included with a package
              manager installation of MongoDB, the corresponding
              storage.dbPath setting uses a different default.

              The files in --dbpath must correspond to the storage engine
              specified in --storageEngine. If the data files do not
              correspond to --storageEngine, mongod will refuse to start.

       mongod --directoryperdb

              Uses a separate directory to store data for each database. The
              directories are under the --dbpath directory, and each
              subdirectory name corresponds to the database name.

              Not available for mongod instances that use the in-memory
              storage engine.

              Starting in MongoDB 5.0, dropping the final collection in a
              database (or dropping the database itself) when --directoryperdb
              is enabled deletes the newly empty subdirectory for that
              database.

              To change the --directoryperdb option for existing deployments:

                     • For standalone instances:

                       •   Use mongodump on the existing mongod instance to
                           generate a backup.

                       •   Stop the mongod instance.

                       •   Add the --directoryperdb value and configure a new
                           data directory

                       •   Restart the mongod instance.

                       •   Use mongorestore to populate the new data
                           directory.

                     • For replica sets:

                       •   Stop a secondary member.

                       •   Add the --directoryperdb value and configure a new
                           data directory to that secondary member.

                       •   Restart that secondary.

                       •   Use initial sync to populate the new data
                           directory.

                       •   Update remaining secondaries in the same fashion.

                       •   Step down the primary, and update the stepped-down
                           member in the same fashion.

       mongod --syncdelay

              Default: 60

              Controls how much time can pass before MongoDB flushes data to
              the data files via an fsync operation.

              Do not set this value on production systems. In almost every
              situation, you should use the default setting.

              If you set --syncdelay to 0, MongoDB will not sync the memory
              mapped files to disk.

              The mongod process writes data very quickly to the journal and
              lazily to the data files. --syncdelay has no effect on
              journaling, but if --syncdelay is set to 0 the journal will
              eventually consume all available disk space.

              Not available for mongod instances that use the in-memory
              storage engine.

       mongod --upgrade

              Upgrades the on-disk data format of the files specified by the
              --dbpath to the latest version, if needed.

              This option only affects the operation of the mongod if the data
              files are in an old format.

              In most cases you should not set this value, so you can exercise
              the most control over your upgrade process. See the MongoDB
              release notes for more information about the upgrade process.

       mongod --repair

              Runs a repair routine on all databases for a mongod instance.

              Starting in MongoDB 5.0:

                     • The repair operation validates the collections to find
                       any inconsistencies and fixes them if possible, which
                       avoids rebuilding the indexes.

                     • If a collection's data file is salvaged or if the
                       collection has inconsistencies that the validate step
                       is unable to fix, then all indexes are rebuilt.

              In MongoDB 4.4 and previous versions, the repair operation
              attempts to:

                     • Salvage corrupt data. The operation discards any
                       corrupt data that cannot be salvaged.

                     • Rebuild indexes. The operation validates collections
                       and rebuilds all indexes for collections with
                       inconsistencies between the collection data and one or
                       more indexes. The operation also rebuilds indexes for
                       all salvaged and modified collections.  (Changed in
                       version 4.4.)

              If you are running with journaling enabled, there is almost
              never any need to run repair since the server can use the
              journal files to restore the data files to a clean state
              automatically.  However, you may need to run repair in cases
              where you need to recover from a disk-level data corruption.

                     • Only use mongod --repair if you have no other options.
                       The operation removes and does not save any corrupt
                       data during the repair process.

                     • Avoid running --repair against a replica set member:

                       •   To repair a replica set member, if you have an
                           intact copy of your data available (e.g. a recent
                           backup or an intact member of the replica set),
                           restore from that intact copy instead(see Resync a
                           Member of a Replica Set).

                       •   If you do choose to run mongod --repair against a
                           replica set member and the operation modifies the
                           data or the metadata, you must still perform a full
                           resync in order for the member to rejoin the
                           replica set.

                     • Before using --repair, make a backup copy of the dbpath
                       directory.

                     • If repair fails to complete for any reason, you must
                       restart the instance using the --repair option.

       mongod --journalCommitInterval

              Default: 100

              The maximum amount of time in milliseconds that the mongod
              process allows between journal operations. Values can range from
              1 to 500 milliseconds. Lower values increase the durability of
              the journal, at the expense of disk performance.

              On WiredTiger, the default journal commit interval is 100
              milliseconds. Additionally, a write that includes or implies
              j:true will cause an immediate sync of the journal. For details
              or additional conditions that affect the frequency of the sync,
              see Journaling Process.

              Not available for mongod instances that use the in-memory
              storage engine.

              Known Issue in 4.2.0: The --journalCommitInterval is missing in
              4.2.0.

   WIREDTIGER OPTIONS
       mongod --wiredTigerCacheSizeGB

              Defines the maximum size of the internal cache that WiredTiger
              will use for all data. The memory consumed by an index build
              (see maxIndexBuildMemoryUsageMegabytes) is separate from the
              WiredTiger cache memory.

              Values can range from 0.25 GB to 10000 GB.

              Starting in MongoDB 3.4, the default WiredTiger internal cache
              size is the larger of either:

                     • 50% of (RAM - 1 GB), or

                     • 256 MB.

              For example, on a system with a total of 4GB of RAM the
              WiredTiger cache will use 1.5GB of RAM (0.5 * (4 GB - 1 GB) =
              1.5 GB).  Conversely, a system with a total of 1.25 GB of RAM
              will allocate 256 MB to the WiredTiger cache because that is
              more than half of the total RAM minus one gigabyte (0.5 * (1.25
              GB - 1 GB) = 128 MB < 256 MB).

              In some instances, such as when running in a container, the
              database can have memory constraints that are lower than the
              total system memory. In such instances, this memory limit,
              rather than the total system memory, is used as the maximum RAM
              available.

              To see the memory limit, see hostInfo.system.memLimitMB.

              Avoid increasing the WiredTiger internal cache size above its
              default value.

              With WiredTiger, MongoDB utilizes both the WiredTiger internal
              cache and the filesystem cache.

              Via the filesystem cache, MongoDB automatically uses all free
              memory that is not used by the WiredTiger cache or by other
              processes.

              The --wiredTigerCacheSizeGB limits the size of the WiredTiger
              internal cache. The operating system will use the available free
              memory for filesystem cache, which allows the compressed MongoDB
              data files to stay in memory. In addition, the operating system
              will use any free RAM to buffer file system blocks and file
              system cache.

              To accommodate the additional consumers of RAM, you may have to
              decrease WiredTiger internal cache size.

              The default WiredTiger internal cache size value assumes that
              there is a single mongod instance per machine. If a single
              machine contains multiple MongoDB instances, then you should
              decrease the setting to accommodate the other mongod instances.

              If you run mongod in a container (e.g. lxc, cgroups, Docker,
              etc.) that does not have access to all of the RAM available in a
              system, you must set --wiredTigerCacheSizeGB to a value less
              than the amount of RAM available in the container. The exact
              amount depends on the other processes running in the container.
              See memLimitMB.

       mongod --wiredTigerMaxCacheOverflowFileSizeGB

              MongoDB deprecates the --wiredTigerMaxCacheOverflowFileSizeGB
              option. The option has no effect starting in MongoDB 4.4.

              Specifies the maximum size (in GB) for the "lookaside (or cache
              overflow) table" file WiredTigerLAS.wt for MongoDB 4.2.1-4.2.x.
              The file no longer exists starting in version 4.4.

              The setting can accept the following values:

                     •

                       •   Value

                       •   Description

                     •

                       •   0

                       •   The default value. If set to 0, the file size is
                           unbounded.

                     •

                       •   number >= 0.1

                       •   The maximum size (in GB). If the WiredTigerLAS.wt
                           file exceeds this size, mongod exits with a fatal
                           assertion. You can clear the WiredTigerLAS.wt file
                           and restart mongod.

              To change the maximum size during runtime, use the
              wiredTigerMaxCacheOverflowSizeGB parameter.

       mongod --wiredTigerJournalCompressor

              Default: snappy

              Specifies the type of compression to use to compress WiredTiger
              journal data.

              Available compressors are:

                     • none

                     • snappy

                     • zlib

                     • zstd (Available starting in MongoDB 4.2)

       mongod --wiredTigerDirectoryForIndexes

              When you start mongod with --wiredTigerDirectoryForIndexes,
              mongod stores indexes and collections in separate subdirectories
              under the data (i.e. --dbpath) directory.  Specifically, mongod
              stores the indexes in a subdirectory named index and the
              collection data in a subdirectory named collection.

              By using a symbolic link, you can specify a different location
              for the indexes. Specifically, when mongod instance is not
              running, move the index subdirectory to the destination and
              create a symbolic link named index under the data directory to
              the new destination.

       mongod --wiredTigerCollectionBlockCompressor

              Default: snappy

              Specifies the default compression for collection data. You can
              override this on a per-collection basis when creating
              collections.

              Available compressors are:

                     • none

                     • snappy

                     • zlib

                     • zstd (Available starting MongoDB 4.2)

              --wiredTigerCollectionBlockCompressor affects all collections
              created. If you change the value of
              --wiredTigerCollectionBlockCompressor on an existing MongoDB
              deployment, all new collections will use the specified
              compressor. Existing collections will continue to use the
              compressor specified when they were created, or the default
              compressor at that time.

       mongod --wiredTigerIndexPrefixCompression

              Default: true

              Enables or disables prefix compression for index data.

              Specify true for --wiredTigerIndexPrefixCompression to enable
              prefix compression for index data, or false to disable prefix
              compression for index data.

              The --wiredTigerIndexPrefixCompression setting affects all
              indexes created. If you change the value of
              --wiredTigerIndexPrefixCompression on an existing MongoDB
              deployment, all new indexes will use prefix compression.
              Existing indexes are not affected.

   REPLICATION OPTIONS
       mongod --replSet

              Configures replication. Specify a replica set name as an
              argument to this set. All hosts in the replica set must have the
              same set name.

              If your application connects to more than one replica set, each
              set must have a distinct name. Some drivers group replica set
              connections by replica set name.

       mongod --oplogSize

              Specifies a maximum size in megabytes for the replication
              operation log (i.e., the oplog).

              The oplog can grow past its configured size limit to avoid
              deleting the majority commit point.

              By default, the mongod process creates an oplog based on the
              maximum amount of space available. For 64-bit systems, the oplog
              is typically 5% of available disk space.

              Once the mongod has created the oplog for the first time,
              changing the --oplogSize option will not affect the size of the
              oplog. To change the minimum oplog retention period after
              starting the mongod, use replSetResizeOplog. replSetResizeOplog
              enables you to resize the oplog dynamically without restarting
              the mongod process. To persist the changes made using
              replSetResizeOplog through a restart, update the value of
              --oplogSize.

              See Oplog Size for more information.

       mongod --oplogMinRetentionHours

              Specifies the minimum number of hours to preserve an oplog
              entry, where the decimal values represent the fractions of an
              hour. For example, a value of 1.5 represents one hour and thirty
              minutes.

              The value must be greater than or equal to 0. A value of 0
              indicates that the mongod should truncate the oplog starting
              with the oldest entries to maintain the configured maximum oplog
              size.

              Defaults to 0.

              A mongod started with --oplogMinRetentionHours only removes an
              oplog entry if:

                     • The oplog has reached the maximum configured oplog size
                       and

                     • The oplog entry is older than the configured number of
                       hours based on the host system clock.

              The mongod has the following behavior when configured with a
              minimum oplog retention period:

                     • The oplog can grow without constraint so as to retain
                       oplog entries for the configured number of hours. This
                       may result in reduction or exhaustion of system disk
                       space due to a combination of high write volume and
                       large retention period.

                     • If the oplog grows beyond its maximum size, the mongod
                       may continue to hold that disk space even if the oplog
                       returns to its maximum size or is configured for a
                       smaller maximum size. See Reducing Oplog Size Does Not
                       Immediately Return Disk Space.

                     • The mongod compares the system wall clock to an oplog
                       entries creation wall clock time when enforcing oplog
                       entry retention. Clock drift between cluster components
                       may result in unexpected oplog retention behavior. See
                       Clock Synchronization for more information on clock
                       synchronization across cluster members.

              To change the minimum oplog retention period after starting the
              mongod, use replSetResizeOplog.  replSetResizeOplog enables you
              to resize the oplog dynamically without restarting the mongod
              process. To persist the changes made using replSetResizeOplog
              through a restart, update the value of --oplogMinRetentionHours.

       mongod --enableMajorityReadConcern

              Default: true

              Configures support for "majority" read concern.

              Starting in MongoDB 5.0, --enableMajorityReadConcern cannot be
              changed and is always set to true. In earlier versions of
              MongoDB, --enableMajorityReadConcern was configurable.

              If you are using a three-member primary-secondary-arbiter (PSA)
              architecture, consider the following:

                     • The write concern "majority" can cause performance
                       issues if a secondary is unavailable or lagging. For
                       advice on how to mitigate these issues, see Mitigate
                       Performance Issues with PSA Replica Set.

                     • If you are using a global default "majority" and the
                       write concern is less than the size of the majority,
                       your queries may return stale (not fully replicated)
                       data.

   SHARDED CLUSTER OPTIONS
       mongod --configsvr

              Required if starting a config server.

              Declares that this mongod instance serves as the config server
              of a sharded cluster. When running with this option, clients
              (i.e. other cluster components) cannot write data to any
              database other than config and admin. The default port for a
              mongod with this option is 27019 and the default --dbpath
              directory is /data/configdb, unless specified.

              When starting a MongoDB server with --configsvr, you must also
              specify a --replSet.

              The use of the deprecated mirrored mongod instances as config
              servers (SCCC) is no longer supported.

              The replica set config servers (CSRS) must run the WiredTiger
              storage engine.

              The --configsvr option creates a local oplog.

              Do not use the --configsvr option with --shardsvr. Config
              servers cannot be a shard server.

              Do not use the --configsvr with the
              skipShardingConfigurationChecks parameter. That is, if you are
              temporarily starting the mongod as a standalone for maintenance
              operations, include the parameter
              skipShardingConfigurationChecks and exclude --configsvr.  Once
              maintenance has completed, remove the
              skipShardingConfigurationChecks parameter and restart with
              --configsvr.

       mongod --shardsvr

              Required if starting a shard server.

              Configures this mongod instance as a shard in a sharded cluster.
              The default port for these instances is 27018.

              When starting a MongoDB server with --shardsvr, you must also
              specify a --replSet.

              Do not use the --shardsvr with the
              skipShardingConfigurationChecks parameter. That is, if you are
              temporarily starting the mongod as a standalone for maintenance
              operations, include the parameter
              skipShardingConfigurationChecks and exclude --shardsvr.  Once
              maintenance has completed, remove the
              skipShardingConfigurationChecks parameter and restart with
              --shardsvr.

       mongod --moveParanoia

              If specified, during chunk migration, a shard saves, to the
              moveChunk directory of the --dbpath, all documents migrated from
              that shard.

              MongoDB does not automatically delete the data saved in the
              moveChunk directory.

       mongod --noMoveParanoia

              During chunk migration, a shard does not save documents migrated
              from the shard.

              This is the default behavior.

   TLS OPTIONS
       Configure mongod and mongos for TLS/SSL for full documentation of
       MongoDB's support.

       mongod --tlsMode

              Enables TLS used for all network connections. The argument to
              the --tlsMode option can be one of the following:

                     •

                       •   Value

                       •   Description

                     •

                       •   disabled

                       •   The server does not use TLS.

                     •

                       •   allowTLS

                       •   Connections between servers do not use TLS. For
                           incoming connections, the server accepts both TLS
                           and non-TLS.

                     •

                       •   preferTLS

                       •   Connections between servers use TLS. For incoming
                           connections, the server accepts both TLS and
                           non-TLS.

                     •

                       •   requireTLS

                       •   The server uses and accepts only TLS encrypted
                           connections.

              If --tlsCAFile or tls.CAFile is not specified and you are not
              using x.509 authentication, the system-wide CA certificate store
              will be used when connecting to an TLS-enabled server.

              If using x.509 authentication, --tlsCAFile or tls.CAFile must be
              specified unless using --tlsCertificateSelector.

              For more information about TLS and MongoDB, see Configure mongod
              and mongos for TLS/SSL and TLS/SSL Configuration for Clients .

       mongod --tlsCertificateKeyFile

              Specifies the .pem file that contains both the TLS certificate
              and key.

              On macOS or Windows, you can use the --tlsCertificateSelector
              option to specify a certificate from the operating system's
              secure certificate store instead of a PEM key file.
              --tlsCertificateKeyFile and --tlsCertificateSelector options are
              mutually exclusive.  You can only specify one.

                     • On Linux/BSD, you must specify --tlsCertificateKeyFile
                       when TLS/SSL is enabled.

                     • On Windows or macOS, you must specify either
                       --tlsCertificateKeyFile or --tlsCertificateSelector
                       when TLS/SSL is enabled.

                       For Windows only, MongoDB does not support encrypted
                       PEM files. The mongod fails to start if it encounters
                       an encrypted PEM file. To securely store and access a
                       certificate for use with TLS on Windows, use
                       --tlsCertificateSelector.

              For more information about TLS and MongoDB, see Configure mongod
              and mongos for TLS/SSL and TLS/SSL Configuration for Clients .

       mongod --tlsCertificateKeyFilePassword

              Specifies the password to decrypt the certificate-key file (i.e.
              --tlsCertificateKeyFile). Use the
              --tlsCertificateKeyFilePassword option only if the
              certificate-key file is encrypted. In all cases, the mongod will
              redact the password from all logging and reporting output.

                     • On Linux/BSD, if the private key in the PEM file is
                       encrypted and you do not specify the
                       --tlsCertificateKeyFilePassword option, MongoDB will
                       prompt for a passphrase. See TLS/SSL Certificate
                       Passphrase.

                     • On macOS, if the private key in the PEM file is
                       encrypted, you must explicitly specify the
                       --tlsCertificateKeyFilePassword option. Alternatively,
                       you can use a certificate from the secure system store
                       (see --tlsCertificateSelector) instead of a PEM file or
                       use an unencrypted PEM file.

                     • On Windows, MongoDB does not support encrypted
                       certificates.  The mongod fails if it encounters an
                       encrypted PEM file. Use --tlsCertificateSelector
                       instead.

              For more information about TLS and MongoDB, see Configure mongod
              and mongos for TLS/SSL and TLS/SSL Configuration for Clients .

       mongod --clusterAuthMode

              Default: keyFile

              The authentication mode used for cluster authentication. If you
              use internal x.509 authentication, specify so here. This option
              can have one of the following values:

                     •

                       •   Value

                       •   Description

                     •

                       •   keyFile

                       •   Use a keyfile for authentication.  Accept only
                           keyfiles.

                     •

                       •   sendKeyFile

                       •   For rolling upgrade purposes. Send a keyfile for
                           authentication but can accept both keyfiles and
                           x.509 certificates.

                     •

                       •   sendX509

                       •   For rolling upgrade purposes. Send the x.509
                           certificate for authentication but can accept both
                           keyfiles and x.509 certificates.

                     •

                       •   x509

                       •   Recommended. Send the x.509 certificate for
                           authentication and accept only x.509 certificates.

              If --tlsCAFile or tls.CAFile is not specified and you are not
              using x.509 authentication, the system-wide CA certificate store
              will be used when connecting to an TLS-enabled server.

              If using x.509 authentication, --tlsCAFile or tls.CAFile must be
              specified unless using --tlsCertificateSelector.

              For more information about TLS and MongoDB, see Configure mongod
              and mongos for TLS/SSL and TLS/SSL Configuration for Clients .

       mongod --tlsClusterFile

              Specifies the .pem file that contains the x.509 certificate-key
              file for membership authentication for the cluster or replica
              set.

              On macOS or Windows, you can use the
              --tlsClusterCertificateSelector option to specify a certificate
              from the operating system's secure certificate store instead of
              a PEM key file. --tlsClusterFile and
              --tlsClusterCertificateSelector options are mutually exclusive.
              You can only specify one.

              If --tlsClusterFile does not specify the .pem file for internal
              cluster authentication or the alternative
              --tlsClusterCertificateSelector, the cluster uses the .pem file
              specified in the --tlsCertificateKeyFile option or the
              certificate returned by the --tlsCertificateSelector.

              If using x.509 authentication, --tlsCAFile or tls.CAFile must be
              specified unless using --tlsCertificateSelector.

              mongod / mongos logs a warning on connection if the presented
              x.509 certificate expires within 30 days of the mongod/mongos
              host system time. See x.509 Certificates Nearing Expiry Trigger
              Warnings for more information.

              The mongod fails to start if it encounters an encrypted PEM
              file. To securely store and access a certificate for use with
              membership authentication on Windows, use
              --tlsClusterCertificateSelector.

       mongod --tlsCertificateSelector

              Available on Windows and macOS as an alternative to
              --tlsCertificateKeyFile.

              Specifies a certificate property in order to select a matching
              certificate from the operating system's certificate store to use
              for TLS.

              The --tlsCertificateKeyFile and --tlsCertificateSelector options
              are mutually exclusive.  You can only specify one.

              --tlsCertificateSelector accepts an argument of the format
              <property>=<value> where the property can be one of the
              following:

                     •

                       •   Property

                       •   Value type

                       •   Description

                     •

                       •   subject

                       •   ASCII string

                       •   Subject name or common name on certificate

                     •

                       •   thumbprint

                       •   hex string

                       •   A sequence of bytes, expressed as hexadecimal, used
                           to identify a public key by its SHA-1 digest.

                           The thumbprint is sometimes referred to as a
                           fingerprint.

              When using the system SSL certificate store, OCSP (Online
              Certificate Status Protocol) is used to validate the revocation
              status of certificates.

              The mongod searches the operating system's secure certificate
              store for the CA certificates required to validate the full
              certificate chain of the specified TLS certificate.
              Specifically, the secure certificate store must contain the root
              CA and any intermediate CA certificates required to build the
              full certificate chain to the TLS certificate. Do not use
              --tlsCAFile or --tlsClusterCAFile to specify the root and
              intermediate CA certificate

              For example, if the TLS/SSL certificate was signed with a single
              root CA certificate, the secure certificate store must contain
              that root CA certificate. If the TLS/SSL certificate was signed
              with an intermediate CA certificate, the secure certificate
              store must contain the intermedia CA certificate and the root CA
              certificate.

              You cannot use the rotateCertificates command or the
              db.rotateCertificates() shell method when using
              net.tls.certificateSelector or --tlsCertificateSelector set to
              thumbprint

       mongod --tlsClusterCertificateSelector

              Available on Windows and macOS as an alternative to
              --tlsClusterFile.

              Specifies a certificate property in order to select a matching
              certificate from the operating system's certificate store to use
              for internal x.509 membership authentication.

              --tlsClusterFile and --tlsClusterCertificateSelector options are
              mutually exclusive. You can only specify one.

              --tlsClusterCertificateSelector accepts an argument of the
              format <property>=<value> where the property can be one of the
              following:

                     •

                       •   Property

                       •   Value type

              --tlsCAFile or --tlsClusterCAFile to specify the root and
              intermediate CA certificate.

              For example, if the cluster certificate was signed with a single
              root CA certificate, the secure certificate store must contain
              that root CA certificate. If the cluster certificate was signed
              with an intermediate CA certificate, the secure certificate
              store must contain the intermedia CA certificate and the root CA
              certificate.

              mongod / mongos logs a warning on connection if the presented
              x.509 certificate expires within 30 days of the mongod/mongos
              host system time. See x.509 Certificates Nearing Expiry Trigger
              Warnings for more information.

       mongod --tlsClusterPassword

              Specifies the password to decrypt the x.509 certificate-key file
              specified with --tlsClusterFile. Use the --tlsClusterPassword
              option only if the certificate-key file is encrypted. In all
              cases, the mongod will redact the password from all logging and
              reporting output.

                     • On Linux/BSD, if the private key in the x.509 file is
                       encrypted and you do not specify the
                       --tlsClusterPassword option, MongoDB will prompt for a
                       passphrase. See TLS/SSL Certificate Passphrase.

                     • On macOS, if the private key in the x.509 file is
                       encrypted, you must explicitly specify the
                       --tlsClusterPassword option. Alternatively, you can
                       either use a certificate from the secure system store
                       (see --tlsClusterCertificateSelector) instead of a
                       cluster PEM file or use an unencrypted PEM file.

                     • On Windows, MongoDB does not support encrypted
                       certificates.  The mongod fails if it encounters an

       mongod --tlsCAFile

              Specifies the .pem file that contains the root certificate chain
              from the Certificate Authority. Specify the file name of the
              .pem file using relative or absolute paths.

              Windows/macOS Only

                     If using --tlsCertificateSelector and/or
                     --tlsClusterCertificateSelector, do not use --tlsCAFile
                     to specify the root and intermediate CA certificates.

              and mongos for TLS/SSL and TLS/SSL Configuration for Clients .

       mongod --tlsClusterCAFile

              Specifies the .pem file that contains the root certificate chain
              from the Certificate Authority used to validate the certificate
              presented by a client establishing a connection. Specify the
              file name of the .pem file using relative or absolute paths.
              --tlsClusterCAFile requires that --tlsCAFile is set.

              If --tlsClusterCAFile does not specify the .pem file for
              validating the certificate from a client establishing a
              connection, the cluster uses the .pem file specified in the
              --tlsCAFile option.

              --tlsClusterCAFile lets you use separate Certificate Authorities
              to verify the client to server and server to client portions of
              the TLS handshake.

              Windows/macOS Only

                     If using --tlsCertificateSelector and/or
                     --tlsClusterCertificateSelector, do not use
                     --tlsClusterCAFile to specify the root and intermediate
                     CA certificates. Store all CA certificates required to
                     validate the full trust chain of the
                     --tlsCertificateSelector and/or
                     --tlsClusterCertificateSelector certificates in the
                     secure certificate store.

              and mongos for TLS/SSL and TLS/SSL Configuration for Clients .

       mongod --tlsCRLFile

              Specifies the .pem file that contains the Certificate Revocation
              List. Specify the file name of the .pem file using relative or
              absolute paths.

                     • You cannot specify a CRL file on macOS. Instead, you
                       can use the system SSL certificate store, which uses
                       OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) to validate
                       the revocation status of certificates. See
                       --tlsCertificateSelector to use the system SSL
                       certificate store.

                     • Starting in version 4.4, to check for certificate
                       revocation, MongoDB enables the use of OCSP (Online
                       Certificate Status Protocol) by default as an
                       alternative to specifying a CRL file or using the
                       system SSL certificate store.

              For more information about TLS and MongoDB, see Configure mongod
              and mongos for TLS/SSL and TLS/SSL Configuration for Clients .

       mongod --tlsAllowInvalidCertificates

              Bypasses the validation checks for TLS certificates on other
              servers in the cluster and allows the use of invalid
              certificates to connect.

              If you specify --tlsAllowInvalidCertificates or
              tls.allowInvalidCertificates: true when using x.509
              authentication, an invalid certificate is only sufficient to
              establish a TLS connection but is insufficient for
              authentication.

              When using the --tlsAllowInvalidCertificates setting, MongoDB
              logs a warning regarding the use of the invalid certificate.

              For more information about TLS and MongoDB, see Configure mongod
              and mongos for TLS/SSL and TLS/SSL Configuration for Clients .

       mongod --tlsAllowInvalidHostnames

              Disables the validation of the hostnames in TLS certificates,
              when connecting to other members of the replica set or sharded
              cluster for inter-process authentication. This allows mongod to
              connect to other members if the hostnames in their certificates
              do not match their configured hostname.

              For more information about TLS and MongoDB, see Configure mongod
              and mongos for TLS/SSL and TLS/SSL Configuration for Clients .

       mongod --tlsAllowConnectionsWithoutCertificates

              For clients that don't provide certificates, mongod or mongos
              encrypts the TLS/SSL connection, assuming the connection is
              successfully made.

              For clients that present a certificate, however, mongod performs
              certificate validation using the root certificate chain
              specified by --tlsCAFile and reject clients with invalid
              certificates.

              Use the --tlsAllowConnectionsWithoutCertificates option if you
              have a mixed deployment that includes clients that do not or
              cannot present certificates to the mongod.

              For more information about TLS and MongoDB, see Configure mongod
              and mongos for TLS/SSL and TLS/SSL Configuration for Clients .

       mongod --tlsDisabledProtocols

              Prevents a MongoDB server running with TLS from accepting
              incoming connections that use a specific protocol or protocols.
              To specify multiple protocols, use a comma separated list of
              protocols.

              --tlsDisabledProtocols recognizes the following protocols:
              TLS1_0, TLS1_1, TLS1_2, and TLS1_3.

                     • On macOS, you cannot disable TLS1_1 and leave both
                       TLS1_0 and TLS1_2 enabled. You must disable at least
                       one of the other two, for example, TLS1_0,TLS1_1.

                     • To list multiple protocols, specify as a comma
                       separated list of protocols. For example TLS1_0,TLS1_1.

                     • Specifying an unrecognized protocol will prevent the
                       server from starting.

                     • The specified disabled protocols overrides any default
                       disabled protocols.

              MongoDB disables the use of TLS 1.0 if TLS 1.1+ is available on
              the system. To enable the disabled TLS 1.0, specify none to
              --tlsDisabledProtocols. See Disable TLS 1.0.

              Members of replica sets and sharded clusters must speak at least
              one protocol in common.

              Disallow Protocols

       mongod --tlsFIPSMode

              Directs the mongod to use the FIPS mode of the  TLS library.
              Your system must have a FIPS compliant library to use the
              --tlsFIPSMode option.

              FIPS-compatible TLS/SSL is available only in MongoDB Enterprise
              (http://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise-advanced?tck=docs_server).
              See Configure MongoDB for FIPS for more information.

   SSL OPTIONS (DEPRECATED)
       All SSL options are deprecated since 4.2. Use the TLS counterparts
       instead, as they have identical functionality to the SSL options.  The
       SSL protocol is deprecated and MongoDB supports TLS 1.0 and later.

       Configure mongod and mongos for TLS/SSL for full documentation of
       MongoDB's support.

       mongod --sslOnNormalPorts

              Use --tlsMode requireTLS instead.

              Enables TLS/SSL for mongod.

              With --sslOnNormalPorts, a mongod requires TLS/SSL encryption
              for all connections on the default MongoDB port, or the port
              specified by --port. By default, --sslOnNormalPorts is disabled.

              For more information about TLS/SSL and MongoDB, see Configure
              mongod and mongos for TLS/SSL and TLS/SSL Configuration for
              Clients .

       mongod --sslMode

              Use --tlsMode instead.

              Enables TLS/SSL or mixed TLS/SSL used for all network
              connections. The argument to the --sslMode option can be one of
              the following:

                     •

                       •   Value

                       •   Description

                     •

                       •   disabled

                       •   The server does not use TLS/SSL.

                     •

                       •   allowSSL

                       •   Connections between servers do not use TLS/SSL. For
                           incoming connections, the server accepts both
                           TLS/SSL and non-TLS/non-SSL.

                     •

                       •   preferSSL

                       •   Connections between servers use TLS/SSL. For
                           incoming connections, the server accepts both
                           TLS/SSL and non-TLS/non-SSL.

                     •

                       •   requireSSL

                       •   The server uses and accepts only TLS/SSL encrypted
                           connections.

              If --tlsCAFile/net.tls.CAFile (or their aliases
              --sslCAFile/net.ssl.CAFile) is not specified and you are not
              using x.509 authentication, the system-wide CA certificate store
              will be used when connecting to an TLS/SSL-enabled server.

              To use x.509 authentication, --tlsCAFile or net.tls.CAFile must
              be specified unless you are using --tlsCertificateSelector or
              --net.tls.certificateSelector.

              For more information about TLS/SSL and MongoDB, see Configure
              mongod and mongos for TLS/SSL and TLS/SSL Configuration for
              Clients .

       mongod --sslPEMKeyFile

              Use --tlsCertificateKeyFile instead.

              Specifies the .pem file that contains both the TLS/SSL
              certificate and key.

              On macOS or Windows, you can use the --sslCertificateSelector
              option to specify a certificate from the operating system's
              secure certificate store instead of a PEM key file.
              --sslPEMKeyFile and --sslCertificateSelector options are
              mutually exclusive.  You can only specify one.

                     • On Linux/BSD, you must specify --sslPEMKeyFile when
                       TLS/SSL is enabled.

                     • On Windows or macOS, you must specify either
                       --sslPEMKeyFile or --sslCertificateSelector when
                       TLS/SSL is enabled.

                       For Windows only, MongoDB does not support encrypted
                       PEM files. The mongod fails to start if it encounters
                       an encrypted PEM file. To securely store and access a
                       certificate for use with TLS/SSL on Windows, use
                       --sslCertificateSelector.

              For more information about TLS/SSL and MongoDB, see Configure
              mongod and mongos for TLS/SSL and TLS/SSL Configuration for
              Clients .

       mongod --sslPEMKeyPassword

              Use --tlsCertificateKeyFilePassword instead.

              Specifies the password to decrypt the certificate-key file (i.e.
              --sslPEMKeyFile). Use the --sslPEMKeyPassword option only if the
              certificate-key file is encrypted. In all cases, the mongod will
              redact the password from all logging and reporting output.

                     • On Linux/BSD, if the private key in the PEM file is
                       encrypted and you do not specify the
                       --sslPEMKeyPassword option, MongoDB will prompt for a
                       passphrase. See TLS/SSL Certificate Passphrase.

                     • On macOS, if the private key in the PEM file is
                       encrypted, you must explicitly specify the
                       --sslPEMKeyPassword option. Alternatively, you can use
                       a certificate from the secure system store (see
                       --sslCertificateSelector) instead of a PEM key file or
                       use an unencrypted PEM file.

                     • On Windows, MongoDB does not support encrypted
                       certificates.  The mongod fails if it encounters an
                       encrypted PEM file. Use --sslCertificateSelector
                       instead.

              For more information about TLS/SSL and MongoDB, see Configure

              Clients .

       mongod --sslClusterFile

              Use --tlsClusterFile instead.

              Specifies the .pem file that contains the x.509 certificate-key
              file for membership authentication for the cluster or replica
              set.

              On macOS or Windows, you can use the
              --sslClusterCertificateSelector option to specify a certificate
              from the operating system's secure certificate store instead of
              a PEM key file. --sslClusterFile and
              --sslClusterCertificateSelector options are mutually exclusive.
              You can only specify one.

              If --sslClusterFile does not specify the .pem file for internal
              cluster authentication or the alternative
              --sslClusterCertificateSelector, the cluster uses the .pem file
              specified in the --sslPEMKeyFile option or the certificate
              returned by the --sslCertificateSelector.

              To use x.509 authentication, --tlsCAFile or net.tls.CAFile must
              be specified unless you are using --tlsCertificateSelector or
              --net.tls.certificateSelector.

              For more information about TLS/SSL and MongoDB, see Configure

       mongod --sslCertificateSelector

              Use --tlsCertificateSelector instead.

              Available on Windows and macOS as an alternative to
              --tlsCertificateKeyFile.

              Specifies a certificate property to select a matching
              certificate from the operating system's secure certificate store
              to use for TLS/SSL.

              --sslPEMKeyFile and --sslCertificateSelector options are
              mutually exclusive. You can only specify one.

              --sslCertificateSelector accepts an argument of the format
              <property>=<value> where the property can be one of the
              following:

                     •

                       •   Property

                       •   Value type

                     •

                       •   thumbprint

                       •   hex string

                       •   A sequence of bytes, expressed as hexadecimal, used
                           to identify a public key by its SHA-1 digest.

                           The thumbprint is sometimes referred to as a
                           fingerprint.

              When using the system SSL certificate store, OCSP (Online
              Certificate Status Protocol) is used to validate the revocation
              status of certificates.

              The mongod searches the operating system's secure certificate
              store for the CA certificates required to validate the full
              certificate chain of the specified TLS/SSL certificate.
              Specifically, the secure certificate store must contain the root
              CA and any intermediate CA certificates required to build the
              full certificate chain to the TLS/SSL certificate. Do not use
              --sslCAFile or --sslClusterCAFile to specify the root and
              intermediate CA certificate

              For example, if the TLS/SSL certificate was signed with a single
              root CA certificate, the secure certificate store must contain
              that root CA certificate. If the TLS/SSL certificate was signed
              with an intermediate CA certificate, the secure certificate
              store must contain the intermedia CA certificate and the root CA
              certificate.

       mongod --sslClusterCertificateSelector

              Use --tlsClusterCertificateSelector instead.

              Available on Windows and macOS as an alternative to
              --sslClusterFile.

              Specifies a certificate property to select a matching
              certificate from the operating system's secure certificate store
              to use for internal x.509 membership authentication.

              --sslClusterFile and --sslClusterCertificateSelector options are
              mutually exclusive. You can only specify one.

              --sslClusterCertificateSelector accepts an argument of the
              format <property>=<value> where the property can be one of the
              following:

              CA and any intermediate CA certificates required to build the
              full certificate chain to the cluster certificate. Do not use
              --sslCAFile or --sslClusterCAFile to specify the root and
              intermediate CA certificate.

              For example, if the cluster certificate was signed with a single
              root CA certificate, the secure certificate store must contain
              that root CA certificate. If the cluster certificate was signed
              with an intermediate CA certificate, the secure certificate
              store must contain the intermedia CA certificate and the root CA
              certificate.

       mongod --sslClusterPassword

              Use --tlsClusterPassword instead.

              Specifies the password to decrypt the x.509 certificate-key file
              specified with --sslClusterFile. Use the --sslClusterPassword
              option only if the certificate-key file is encrypted. In all
              cases, the mongod will redact the password from all logging and
              reporting output.

                     • On Linux/BSD, if the private key in the x.509 file is
                       encrypted and you do not specify the
                       --sslClusterPassword option, MongoDB will prompt for a
                       passphrase. See TLS/SSL Certificate Passphrase.

                     • On macOS, if the private key in the x.509 file is
                       encrypted, you must explicitly specify the
                       --sslClusterPassword option.  Alternatively, you can
                       either use a certificate from the secure system store
                       (see --sslClusterCertificateSelector) instead of a
                       cluster PEM file or use an unencrypted PEM file.

                     • On Windows, MongoDB does not support encrypted
                       certificates.  The mongod fails if it encounters an
                       encrypted PEM file. Use --sslClusterCertificateSelector
                       instead.

       mongod --sslCAFile

              Use --tlsCAFile instead.

              Specifies the .pem file that contains the root certificate chain
              from the Certificate Authority. Specify the file name of the
              .pem file using relative or absolute paths.

              Windows/macOS Only

                     If using --sslCertificateSelector and/or
                     --sslClusterCertificateSelector, do not use --sslCAFile
                     to specify the root and intermediate CA certificates.
                     Store all CA certificates required to validate the full
                     trust chain of the --sslCertificateSelector and/or
                     --sslClusterCertificateSelector certificates in the
                     secure certificate store.

       mongod --sslClusterCAFile

              Use --tlsClusterCAFile instead.

              Specifies the .pem file that contains the root certificate chain
              from the Certificate Authority used to validate the certificate
              presented by a client establishing a connection. Specify the
              file name of the .pem file using relative or absolute paths.
              --sslClusterCAFile requires that --sslCAFile is set.

              If --sslClusterCAFile does not specify the .pem file for
              validating the certificate from a client establishing a
              connection, the cluster uses the .pem file specified in the
              --sslCAFile option.

              --sslClusterCAFile lets you use separate Certificate Authorities
              to verify the client to server and server to client portions of
              the TLS handshake.

              Windows/macOS Only

                     If using --sslCertificateSelector and/or
                     --sslClusterCertificateSelector, do not use
                     --sslClusterCAFile to specify the root and intermediate
                     CA certificates. Store all CA certificates required to
                     validate the full trust chain of the
                     --sslCertificateSelector and/or
                     --sslClusterCertificateSelector certificates in the
                     secure certificate store.

       mongod --sslCRLFile

              Use --tlsCRLFile instead.

              Specifies the .pem file that contains the Certificate Revocation
              List. Specify the file name of the .pem file using relative or
              absolute paths.

                     • You cannot specify a CRL file on macOS. Instead, you
                       can use the system SSL certificate store, which uses
                       OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) to validate
                       the revocation status of certificates. See
                       --tlsCertificateSelector in MongoDB 4.2+ to use the
                       system SSL certificate store.

                     • Starting in version 4.4, to check for certificate
                       revocation, MongoDB enables the use of OCSP (Online
                       Certificate Status Protocol) by default as an
                       alternative to specifying a CRL file or using the
                       system SSL certificate store.

       mongod --sslAllowInvalidCertificates

              Use --tlsAllowInvalidCertificates instead.

              Bypasses the validation checks for TLS/SSL certificates on other
              servers in the cluster and allows the use of invalid
              certificates to connect.

              Starting in MongoDB 4.0, if you specify any of the following
              x.509 authentication options, an invalid certificate is
              sufficient only to establish a TLS connection but it is
              insufficient for authentication:

                     • --sslAllowInvalidCertificates or
                       net.ssl.allowInvalidCertificates: true for MongoDB 4.0
                       and later

                     • --tlsAllowInvalidCertificates or
                       net.tls.allowInvalidCertificates: true for MongoDB 4.2
                       and later

              When using the --sslAllowInvalidCertificates setting, MongoDB
              logs a warning regarding the use of the invalid certificate.

              For more information about TLS/SSL and MongoDB, see Configure
              mongod and mongos for TLS/SSL and TLS/SSL Configuration for
              Clients .

       mongod --sslAllowInvalidHostnames

              Use --tlsAllowInvalidHostnames instead.

              Disables the validation of the hostnames in TLS/SSL
              certificates, when connecting to other members of the replica
              set or sharded cluster for inter-process authentication. This
              allows mongod to connect to other members if the hostnames in
              their certificates do not match their configured hostname.

              For more information about TLS/SSL and MongoDB, see Configure
              mongod and mongos for TLS/SSL and TLS/SSL Configuration for
              Clients .

       mongod --sslAllowConnectionsWithoutCertificates

              Use --tlsAllowConnectionsWithoutCertificates instead.

              For clients that don't provide certificates, mongod or mongos
              encrypts the TLS/SSL connection, assuming the connection is
              successfully made.

              For clients that present a certificate, however, mongod performs
              certificate validation using the root certificate chain
              specified by --sslCAFile and reject clients with invalid
              certificates.

              Use the --sslAllowConnectionsWithoutCertificates option if you
              have a mixed deployment that includes clients that do not or
              cannot present certificates to the mongod.

              For more information about TLS/SSL and MongoDB, see Configure
              mongod and mongos for TLS/SSL and TLS/SSL Configuration for
              Clients .

       mongod --sslDisabledProtocols

              Use --tlsDisabledProtocols instead.

              Prevents a MongoDB server running with TLS/SSL from accepting
              incoming connections that use a specific protocol or protocols.
              To specify multiple protocols, use a comma separated list of
              protocols.

              --sslDisabledProtocols recognizes the following protocols:
              TLS1_0, TLS1_1, TLS1_2, and TLS1_3.

                     • On macOS, you cannot disable TLS1_1 and leave both
                       TLS1_0 and TLS1_2 enabled. You must disable at least
                       one of the other two, for example, TLS1_0,TLS1_1.

                     • To list multiple protocols, specify as a comma
                       separated list of protocols. For example TLS1_0,TLS1_1.

                     • Specifying an unrecognized protocol will prevent the
                       server from starting.

                     • The specified disabled protocols overrides any default
                       disabled protocols.

              MongoDB disables the use of TLS 1.0 if TLS 1.1+ is available on
              the system. To enable the disabled TLS 1.0, specify none to
              --sslDisabledProtocols. See Disable TLS 1.0.

              Members of replica sets and sharded clusters must speak at least
              one protocol in common.

              Disallow Protocols

       mongod --sslFIPSMode

              Use --tlsFIPSMode instead.

              Directs the mongod to use the FIPS mode of the  TLS/SSL library.
              Your system must have a FIPS compliant library to use the
              --sslFIPSMode option.

              FIPS-compatible TLS/SSL is available only in MongoDB Enterprise
              (http://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise-advanced?tck=docs_server).
              See Configure MongoDB for FIPS for more information.

   PROFILER OPTIONS
       mongod --profile

              Default: 0

              Configures the database profiler level.  The following profiler
              levels are available:

                     •

                       •   Level

                       •   Description

                     •

                       •   0

                       •   The profiler is off and does not collect any data.
                           This is the default profiler level.

                     •

                       •   1

                       •   The profiler collects data for operations that take
                           longer than the value of slowms or that match a
                           filter.

                           When a filter is set:

                           •     The slowms and sampleRate options are not
                                 used for profiling.

                           •     The profiler only captures operations that
                                 match the filter.

                     •

                       •   2

                       •   The profiler collects data for all operations.

              Profiling can impact performance and shares settings with the
              system log. Carefully consider any performance and security
              implications before configuring and enabling the profiler on a
              production deployment.

              See Profiler Overhead for more information on potential
              performance degradation.

       mongod --slowms

              Default: 100

              The slow operation time threshold, in milliseconds. Operations
              that run for longer than this threshold are considered slow.

              When logLevel is set to 0, MongoDB records slow operations to
              the diagnostic log at a rate determined by slowOpSampleRate.

              At higher logLevel settings, all operations appear in the
              diagnostic log regardless of their latency with the following
              exception: the logging of slow oplog entry messages by the
              secondaries. The secondaries log only the slow oplog entries;
              increasing the logLevel does not log all oplog entries.

              For mongod instances, --slowms affects the diagnostic log and,
              if enabled, the profiler.

              Database Profiler

       mongod --slowOpSampleRate

              Default: 1.0

              The fraction of slow operations that should be profiled or
              logged.  --slowOpSampleRate accepts values between 0 and 1,
              inclusive.

              --slowOpSampleRate does not affect the slow oplog entry logging
              by the secondary members of a replica set. Secondary members log
              all oplog entries that take longer than the slow operation
              threshold regardless of the --slowOpSampleRate.

              For mongod instances, --slowOpSampleRate affects the diagnostic
              log and, if enabled, the profiler.

   AUDIT OPTIONS
       mongod --auditCompressionMode

              Specifies the compression mode for audit log encryption. You
              must also enable audit log encryption using either
              --auditEncryptionKeyUID or --auditLocalKeyFile.

              --auditCompressionMode can be set to one of these values:

                     •

                       •   Value

                       •   Description

                     •

                       •   zstd

                       •   Use the zstd algorithm to compress the audit log.

                     •

                       •   none (default)

                       •   Do not compress the audit log.

              Available only in MongoDB Enterprise
              (http://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise-advanced?tck=docs_server).
              MongoDB Enterprise and Atlas have different configuration
              requirements.

       mongod --auditDestination

              Enables auditing and specifies where mongod sends all audit
              events.

              --auditDestination can have one of the following values:

                     •

                       •   Value

                       •   Description

                     •

                       •   syslog

                       •   Output the audit events to syslog in JSON format.
                           Not available on Windows. Audit messages have a
                           syslog severity level of info and a facility level
                           of user.

                           The syslog message limit can result in the
                           truncation of audit messages. The auditing system
                           will neither detect the truncation nor error upon
                           its occurrence.

                     •

                       •   console

                       •   Output the audit events to stdout in JSON format.

                     •

                       •   file

                       •   Output the audit events to the file specified in
                           --auditPath in the format specified in
                           --auditFormat.

              Available only in MongoDB Enterprise
              (http://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise-advanced?tck=docs_server)
              and MongoDB Atlas (https://cloud.mongodb.com/user#/atlas/login).

       mongod --auditEncryptionKeyUID

              Specifies the unique identifier of the Key Management
              Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) key for audit log encryption.

              You cannot use --auditEncryptionKeyUID and --auditLocalKeyFile
              together.

              Available only in MongoDB Enterprise
              (http://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise-advanced?tck=docs_server).
              MongoDB Enterprise and Atlas have different configuration
              requirements.

       mongod --auditFormat

              Specifies the format of the output file for auditing if
              --auditDestination is file. The --auditFormat option can have
              one of the following values:

                     •

                       •   Value

                       •   Description

                     •

                       •   JSON

                       •   Output the audit events in JSON format to the file
                           specified in --auditPath.

                     •

                       •   BSON

                       •   Output the audit events in BSON binary format to
                           the file specified in --auditPath.

              Printing audit events to a file in JSON format degrades server
              performance more than printing to a file in BSON format.

              Available only in MongoDB Enterprise
              (http://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise-advanced?tck=docs_server)
              and MongoDB Atlas (https://cloud.mongodb.com/user#/atlas/login).

       mongod --auditLocalKeyFile

              Specifies the path and file name for a local audit key file for
              audit log encryption.

              Only use --auditLocalKeyFile for testing because the key is not
              secured. To secure the key, use --auditEncryptionKeyUID and an
              external Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) server.

              You cannot use --auditLocalKeyFile and --auditEncryptionKeyUID
              together.

              Available only in MongoDB Enterprise
              (http://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise-advanced?tck=docs_server).
              MongoDB Enterprise and Atlas have different configuration
              requirements.

       mongod --auditPath

              Specifies the output file for auditing if --auditDestination has
              value of file. The --auditPath option can take either a full

       mongod --auditFilter

              Specifies the filter to limit the types of operations the audit
              system records. The option takes a string representation of a
              query document of the form:

                { <field1>: <expression1>, ... }

              The <field> can be any field in the audit message, including
              fields returned in the param document. The <expression> is a
              query condition expression.

              To specify an audit filter, enclose the filter document in
              single quotes to pass the document as a string.

              To specify the audit filter in a configuration file, you must
              use the YAML format of the configuration file.

              Available only in MongoDB Enterprise

              and MongoDB Atlas (https://cloud.mongodb.com/user#/atlas/login).

   SNMP OPTIONS
       Starting in MongoDB 6.1, SNMP is removed.  All related command line
       options prevent mongod from starting.  To monitor your deployment, use
       MongoDB Ops Manager
       (https://www.mongodb.com/docs/ops-manager/current/).

       mongod --snmp-disabled

              Disables SNMP access to mongod. The option is incompatible with
              --snmp-subagent and --snmp-master.

       mongod --snmp-subagent

              Runs SNMP as a subagent. The option is incompatible with
              --snmp-disabled.

       mongod --snmp-master

              Runs SNMP as a master. The option is incompatible with
              --snmp-disabled.

              • Monitor MongoDB With SNMP on Linux

              • Monitor MongoDB Windows with SNMP

   INMEMORY OPTIONS
       mongod --inMemorySizeGB

              Default: 50% of physical RAM minus 1 GB.

              Maximum amount of memory to allocate for the in-memory storage
              engine data, including indexes, the oplog (if the mongod is part
              of a replica set), sharded cluster metadata, etc.

              Values can range from 256MB to 10TB and can be a float.

              By default, the in-memory storage engine uses 50% of physical
              RAM minus 1 GB.

              Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.

   ENCRYPTION KEY MANAGEMENT OPTIONS
       mongod --enableEncryption

              Default: false

              Enables encryption for the WiredTiger storage engine. This
              option must be enabled in order to pass in encryption keys and
              configurations.

              Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.

       mongod --encryptionCipherMode

              Default: AES256-CBC

              The cipher mode to use for encryption at rest:

                     •

                       •   Mode

                       •   Description

                     •

                       •   AES256-CBC

                       •   256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard in Cipher
                           Block Chaining Mode

                     •

                       •   AES256-GCM

                       •   256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard in
                           Galois/Counter Mode

                           MongoDB Enterprise on Windows no longer supports
                           AES256-GCM. This cipher is now available only on
                           Linux.

              Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.

       mongod --encryptionKeyFile

              The path to the local keyfile when managing keys via process
              other than KMIP. Only set when managing keys via process other
              than KMIP.  If data is already encrypted using KMIP, MongoDB
              will throw an error.

              The keyfile can contain only a single key. The key is either a
              16 or 32 character string.

              Requires --enableEncryption.

              Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.

       mongod --kmipKeyIdentifier

              Unique KMIP identifier for an existing key within the KMIP
              server.  Include to use the key associated with the identifier
              as the system key. You can only use the setting the first time
              you enable encryption for the mongod instance. Requires
              --enableEncryption.

              If unspecified, MongoDB will request that the KMIP server create
              a new key to utilize as the system key.

              If the KMIP server cannot locate a key with the specified
              identifier or the data is already encrypted with a key, MongoDB
              will throw an error

              Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.

       mongod --kmipRotateMasterKey

              Default: false

              If true, rotate the master key and re-encrypt the internal
              keystore.

              Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.

              KMIP Master Key Rotation

       mongod --kmipServerName

              Hostname or IP address of the KMIP server to connect to.
              Requires --enableEncryption.

              Starting in MongoDB 4.2.1, you can specify multiple KMIP servers
              as a comma-separated list, e.g.
              server1.example.com,server2.example.com. On startup, the mongod
              will attempt to establish a connection to each server in the
              order listed, and will select the first server to which it can
              successfully establish a connection. KMIP server selection
              occurs only at startup.

              When connecting to a KMIP server, the mongod verifies that the
              specified --kmipServerName matches the Subject Alternative Name
              SAN (or, if SAN is not present, the Common Name CN) in the
              certificate presented by the KMIP server.  If SAN is present,
              mongod does not match against the CN. If the hostname does not
              match the SAN (or CN), the mongod will fail to connect.

              Starting in MongoDB 4.2, when performing comparison of SAN,
              MongoDB supports comparison of DNS names or IP addresses. In
              previous versions, MongoDB only supports comparisons of DNS
              names.

              Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.

       mongod --kmipPort

              Default: 5696

              Port number to use to communicate with the KMIP server.
              Requires --kmipServerName. Requires --enableEncryption.

              If specifying multiple KMIP servers with --kmipServerName, the
              mongod will use the port specified with --kmipPort for all
              provided KMIP servers.

              Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.

       mongod --kmipConnectRetries

              Default: 0

              How many times to retry the initial connection to the KMIP
              server.  Use together with --kmipConnectTimeoutMS to control how
              long the mongod waits for a response between each retry.

              Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.

       mongod --kmipConnectTimeoutMS

              Default: 5000

              Timeout in milliseconds to wait for a response from the KMIP
              server.  If the --kmipConnectRetries setting is specified, the
              mongod will wait up to the value specified with
              --kmipConnectTimeoutMS for each retry.

              Value must be 1000 or greater.

              Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.

       mongod --kmipClientCertificateSelector

              Available on Windows and macOS as an alternative to
              --kmipClientCertificateFile.

              --kmipClientCertificateFile and --kmipClientCertificateSelector
              options are mutually exclusive. You can only specify one.

              Specifies a certificate property in order to select a matching
              certificate from the operating system's certificate store to
              authenticate MongoDB to the KMIP server.

              --kmipClientCertificateSelector accepts an argument of the
              format <property>=<value> where the property can be one of the
              following:

                     •

                       •   Property

                       •   Value type

                       •   Description

                     •

                       •   subject

                       •   ASCII string

                       •   Subject name or common name on certificate

                     •

                       •   thumbprint

                       •   hex string

                       •   A sequence of bytes, expressed as hexadecimal, used
                           to identify a public key by its SHA-1 digest.

                           The thumbprint is sometimes referred to as a
                           fingerprint.

              Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.

       mongod --kmipClientCertificateFile

              Path to the .pem file used to authenticate MongoDB to the KMIP
              server. The specified .pem file must contain both the TLS/SSL
              certificate and key.

              To use this option, you must also specify the --kmipServerName
              option.

              On macOS or Windows, you can use a certificate from the
              operating system's secure store instead of a PEM key file. See
              --kmipClientCertificateSelector.

              Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.

       mongod --kmipClientCertificatePassword

              The password (if one exists) for the client certificate passed
              into --kmipClientCertificateFile. Is used for authenticating
              MongoDB to the KMIP server. Requires that a
              --kmipClientCertificateFile be provided.

              Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.

       mongod --kmipServerCAFile

              Path to CA File. Used for validating secure client connection to
              KMIP server.

              On macOS or Windows, you can use a certificate from the
              operating system's secure store instead of a PEM key file. See
              --kmipClientCertificateSelector. When using the secure store,
              you do not need to, but can, also specify the
              --kmipServerCAFile.

       mongod --kmipActivateKeys

              Default: true

              Activates all newly created KMIP keys upon creation and then
              periodically checks those keys are in an active state.

              When --kmipActivateKeys is true and you have existing keys on a
              KMIP server, the key must be activated first or the mongod node
              will fail to start.

              If the key being used by the mongod transitions into a
              non-active state, the mongod node will shut down unless
              kmipActivateKeys is false. To ensure you have an active key,
              rotate the KMIP master key by using --kmipRotateMasterKey.

       mongod --kmipKeyStatePollingSeconds

              Default: 900 seconds

              Frequency in seconds at which mongod polls the KMIP server for
              active keys.

              To disable disable polling, set the value to -1.

       mongod --kmipUseLegacyProtocol

              Default: false

              When true, mongod uses KMIP protocol version 1.0 or 1.1 instead
              of the default version. The default KMIP protocol is version
              1.2.

              To use audit log encryption with KMIP version 1.0 or 1.1, you
              must specify auditEncryptKeyWithKMIPGet at startup.

       mongod --eseDatabaseKeyRollover

              Roll over the encrypted storage engine database keys configured
              with AES256-GCM cipher.

              When mongod instance is started with this option, the instance
              rotates the keys and exits.

              Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.

                                                                     mongod(1)
