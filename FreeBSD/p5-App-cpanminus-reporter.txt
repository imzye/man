NAME
       cpanm-reporter - send cpanm output to CPAN Testers

SETUP
       New to CPAN Testers' reporting? No problem! Just run:

          > cpanm-reporter --setup

       And we will walk you through everything you need :)

       (if you already use CPAN::Reporter, you can safely skip the setup)

USAGE
       Call cpanm as you normally would:

          > cpanm Moose Catalyst::Runtime Data::Printer ...

       then, just call cpanm-reporter:

          > cpanm-reporter

   OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
          --version              Shows version number and exits

          --help                 Shows basic usage help and exits

          --build_dir=PATH       Where your build directory is, containing
                                 each dist's subdir. Default: $HOME/.cpanm/latest-build

          --build_logfile=PATH   Where the build.log is. Default: $BUILD_DIR/build.log

          --verbose (or -v)      Extra output

          --quiet (or -q)        As little output as possible (voids -v)

          --setup                Sets up the CPAN Testers configuration for you

          --only=A::B,C::D,...   Only send reports for these modules

          --exclude=A::B,...     Don't send reports for these modules

          --dry-run              Prepare, but do not actually send reports

          --skip-history         Do not read nor write to the history file

DESCRIPTION
       This app properly parses the output of cpanm ("build.log") to
       automatically generate and send reports to the CPAN Testers database.

       "cpanm" has quickly become one of the most used CPAN clients out there,
       but it doesn't come with a native way to generate and send test reports
       to the CPAN Testers infrastructure. This standalone app is able to
       interact with your cpanm after you install a module, and do that for
       you.

   CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
       You can use configuration files with different names and locations by
       setting the following environment variables:

       •   PERL_CPAN_REPORTER_DIR

           The base directory in which your '"config.ini"' file resides.
           Defaults to your home directory (if you're using Linux or OS X) or
           to the 'my documents' folder (if you're running Windows).

       •   PERL_CPAN_REPORTER_CONFIG

           In case you don't want to change just the base directory but the
           entire file's path and name, you can set this variable to point at
           the new 'config.ini' file.

       If you called "cpanm-reporter --setup", you can also set
       "PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT" to true and it will answer any prompted question
       automatically with its default value, if possible.

CAVEATS
       •   This is a standalone tool that reads cpanm's "build.log" file,
           meaning it can potentially be run any time after cpanm has done its
           thing.  As such, you must be cautious to only run this tool right
           after you run cpanm, otherwise your whole environment may have
           changed, rendering the report useless - maybe even turning it into
           a disservice.

           As such, we will *only* parse build.log files last modified up to
           30 minutes before. You can override this by passing the "--force"
           flag to cpanm-reporter, but please take good care to avoid sending
           bogus reports.

       •   cpanm currently does not record the output into your build.log file
           if you pass the "verbose" argument to it, either "--verbose" or
           "-v". If you used those when installing dists, "cpanm-reporter"
           won't find anything to send :(

       •   cpanm-reporter is an external, auxiliary tool to cpanm. Since
           they're not attached, you must take care not to change perls or
           local-libs between installing distributions with "cpanm" and
           generating/sending the reports with "cpanm-reporter". If you're not
           a power user, you don't have to worry about this. Just remember to
           run cpanm-reporter immediately after cpanm and everything will be
           fine :)

           As an added precaution, cpanm-reporter will skip build.log entries
           in which the Perl version recorded in the build.log is different
           than the Perl version that is generating the report. The entries
           will be skipped silently unless the "--verbose" or "-v" flag is
           passed. This version check can be ignored by passing the
           "--ignore-versions" flag to cpanm-reporter. Obviously, this is
           discouraged since it would result in the sending of bogus reports.
