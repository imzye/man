TABLEUTIL(1)            FreeBSD General Commands Manual           TABLEUTIL(1)

NAME
     tableutil – converts and performs operations on tables

SYNOPSIS
     tableutil -c commands
     tableutil -f file
     tableutil -q type [file]

DESCRIPTION
     tableutil can be used to convert files with IP-addresses and ranges and
     aggregate networks.  The options are as follows:

     -c commands
             execute the commands specified by commands.

     -f file
             file is the name of the file with commands to be loaded.

     -q type [file]
             Quick-convert file from type to a CIDR-notation, as used by PF.
             type can be either 'text' or 'p2b'. The text format accepts
             addresses on the form 'n.n.n.n', 'n.n.n.n-n.n.n.n' or
             'n.n.n.n/n'. p2b is the format used in the lists provided by
             blocklist.org. If file is omitted, standard input is assumed.
             p2b-files can be either gzipped or uncompressed.

COMMAND FILE/STRING
     The command file/string consists of a series of statements separated by ;

EXAMPLES
     Example quick-conversion:

                   $ tableutil -q p2b ads.p2b.gz

     Example command-file:

                   # Assign some values to some variables
                   $range = { 192.168.0.0-192.168.2.255 };
                   $cidr = { 192.168.3.0/24 };
                   $text = load(text, "file_with_networks");
                   $p2b = load(p2b, "ads.p2b.gz");

                   # Do some calculations and store them in some other variables
                   $table1 = difference($p2b, $text);
                   $table2 = union($range, $cidr);
                   $table3 = invert( { 192.168.0.1 } );
                   $table4 = intersect( { 192.168.1.0-192.168.3.255 }, $range);

                   # Save some of the variables, and a bonus, to files.
                   save(cidr, "table1", $table1);
                   save(range, "table2", $table2);
                   save(cidr, "table3", $table3);
                   save(cidr, "table4", $table4);
                   save(range, "table5", { 0.0.0.0/0 } );
                   save(single, "table6", $cidr );

RETURN VALUES
     tableutil can exit with the following values:

     0 Command completed successfully.

     1 Invalid arguments supplied.

     -1 Internal error.

BUGS
     Many, probably. And the man-page needs improving.
