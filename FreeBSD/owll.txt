OWLL(9)                FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual               OWLL(9)

NAME
     owll OWLL_WRITE_ONE, OWLL_WRITE_ZERO, OWLL_READ_DATA,
     OWLL_REASET_AND_PRESENCE – Dallas Semiconductor 1-Wire Link Layer
     Interface

SYNOPSIS
     int
     OWLL_WRITE_ONE(device_t lldev, struct ow_timing *timing);

     int
     OWLL_WRITE_ZERO(device_t lldev, struct ow_timing *timing);

     int
     OWLL_READ_DATA(device_t lldev, struct ow_timing *timing, int *bit);

     int
     OWLL_RESET_AND_PRESENCE(device_t lldev, struct ow_timing *timing,
         int *bit);

DESCRIPTION
     The owll interface provides access to the link layer of the Dallas
     Semiconductor 1-Wire from upper layers of the protocol.

     OWLL_WRITE_ONE() and OWLL_WRITE_ZERO() writes a one bit or a zero bit
     respectively on the 1-Wire bus.

     OWLL_READ_DATA() reads one bit from the 1-Wire bus.  This is often
     referred to as a “Read Time Slot” in the 1-Wire device data sheets.

     The OWLL_RESET_AND_PRESENCE() function starts a reset sequence and
     detects if any device(s) are present on the bus.  This is the beginning
     of all 1-Wire transactions.

NOTES
     This interface is intended to be used only by the ow(4) device to talk to
     the low-level bus.  By convention, the device that implements this
     interface is called owc(4).  Only devices that implement own(9) should
     call these interfaces.
