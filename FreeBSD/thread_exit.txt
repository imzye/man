THREAD_EXIT(9)         FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual        THREAD_EXIT(9)

NAME
     thread_exit – abandon current thread context

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <sys/proc.h>

     void
     thread_exit(void);

DESCRIPTION
     The thread_exit() function implements the machine independent prelude to
     a thread shutdown.  It will not return, and will result in a call to
     mi_switch(9) to schedule some other thread.

     thread_exit() arranges to free all the resources of the thread,
     specifically the kernel stack.

     To protect the runqueue(9), thread_exit() must be called with the
     sched_lock mutex held.

SEE ALSO
     mi_switch(9), mutex(9), runqueue(9), sleep(9)
