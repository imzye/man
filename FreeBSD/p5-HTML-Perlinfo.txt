NAME
       HTML::Perlinfo - Display a lot of Perl information in HTML format

SYNOPSIS
               use HTML::Perlinfo;

               perlinfo();

DESCRIPTION
       This module outputs a large amount of information about your Perl
       installation in HTML. So far, this includes information about Perl
       compilation options, the Perl version, server information and
       environment, HTTP headers, OS version information, Perl modules, and
       more.

       HTML::Perlinfo is aimed at Web developers, but almost anyone using Perl
       may find it useful. It is a valuable debugging tool as it contains all
       EGPCS (Environment, GET, POST, Cookie, Server) data. It will also work
       under taint mode.

       The output may be customized by passing one of the following options.

OPTIONS
       There are 8 options to pass to the perlinfo funtion. All of these
       options are also object methods. The key difference is their case:
       Captilize the option name when passing it to the function and use only
       lower-case letters when using the object-oriented approach.

       INFO_GENERAL
           The Perl version, build date, and more.

       INFO_VARIABLES
           Shows all predefined variables from EGPCS (Environment, GET, POST,
           Cookie, Server).

       INFO_CONFIG
           All configuration values from config_sh. INFO_ALL shows only some
           values.

       INFO_APACHE
           Apache HTTP server information, including mod_perl information.

       INFO_MODULES
           All installed modules, their version number and description.
           INFO_ALL shows only core modules.  Please also see
           HTML::Perlinfo::Modules.

       INFO_LOADED
           Post-execution dump of loaded modules (plus INFO_VARIABLES).
           INFO_ALL shows only core modules. Please also see
           HTML::Perlinfo::Loaded.

       INFO_LICENSE
           Perl license information.

       INFO_ALL
           Shows all of the above defaults. This is the default value.

PROGRAMMING STYLE
       There are two styles of programming with Perlinfo.pm, a function-
       oriented style and an object-oriented style.

       Function-oriented style:

               # Show all information, defaults to INFO_ALL
               perlinfo();

               # Show only module information. This shows all installed modules.
               perlinfo(INFO_MODULES);

       Object-oriented style:

               $p = new HTML::Perlinfo;
               $p->info_all;

               # You can also set the CSS values in the constructor!
               $p = HTML::Perlinfo->new(
                       bg_image  => 'http://i104.photobucket.com/albums/m176/perlinfo/camel.gif',
                       bg_repeat => 'yes-repeat'
               );
               $p->info_all;

       More examples ...

               # This is wrong (no capitals)
               $p->INFO_MODULES;

               # But this is correct
               perlinfo(INFO_MODULES);

               # Ditto
               $p->info_modules;

CUSTOMIZING THE HTML
       You can capture the HTML output and manipulate it or you can alter CSS
       elements with object attributes.

       For further details and examples, please see the HTML documentation in
       the HTML::Perlinfo distribution.

SECURITY
       Displaying detailed server information on the internet is not a good
       idea and HTML::Perlinfo reveals a lot of information about the local
       environment. While restricting what system users can publish online is
       wise, you can also hinder them from using the module by installing it
       outside of the usual module directories (see perldoc -q lib). Of
       course, preventing users from installing the module in their own home
       directories is another matter entirely.

NOTES
       1. Print the content-type header first if you are using the module in a
       CGI setting. (mod_perl handles this for you automatically.) If you do
       not print the header, you will produce an internal server error. Of
       course, you can forgo a Web server entirely and use the module at the
       command-line. Please see the perlinfo tool included in this
       distribution.

       2. If the HTML takes too long to load in the browser, then you can try
       flushing the output buffer. By flushing the buffer, the HTML will start
       appearing immediately.

       INFO_APACHE relies soley on environment variables. If you don't use
       Apache, there is nothing to worry about. You do not need to turn
       INFO_APACHE off or anything. The section will simply not appear. Any
       Web server information will still be in the environment variables,
       unless you configure your server to not report information.

       INFO_VARIABLES did not work correctly until version 1.52.

       INFO_LOADED is the only option whose output cannot be assigned to a
       scalar.

       Since the module outputs HTML, you may want to use it in a CGI script,
       but you do not have to. Of course, some information, like HTTP headers,
       would not be available if you use the module at the command-line. If
       you decide to use this module in a CGI script, make sure you print out
       the content-type header beforehand. For example:

               use HTML::Perlinfo;

               print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
               perlinfo();

       Some might notice that HTML::Perlinfo shares the look and feel of the
       PHP function phpinfo. It was originally inspired by that function and
       was first released in 2004 as PHP::Perlinfo, which is no longer
       available on CPAN.
