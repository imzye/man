NAME
       XML::Filter::BufferText - Filter to put all characters() in one event

SYNOPSIS
         my $h = SomeHandler->new;
         my $f = XML::Filter::BufferText->new( Handler => $h );
         my $p = SomeParser->new( Handler => $f );
         $p->parse;

DESCRIPTION
       This is a very simple filter. One common cause of grief (and programmer
       error) is that XML parsers aren't required to provide character events
       in one chunk. They can, but are not forced to, and most don't. This
       filter does the trivial but oft-repeated task of putting all characters
       into a single event.

       Note that this won't help you cases such as:

         <foo> blah <!-- comment --> phubar </foo>

       In the above case, given the interleaving comment, there will be two
       character() events. This may be worked around in the future if there is
       demand for it.

       An interesting way to use this filter, instead of telling users to use
       it, is to return it from your handler's constructor, already configured
       and all.  That'll make the buffering totally transparent to them
       ("XML::SAX::Writer" does that).
