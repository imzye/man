phoon(1)                FreeBSD General Commands Manual               phoon(1)

NAME
       phoon - show the PHase of the mOON

SYNOPSIS
       phoon -l lines] [date]

DESCRIPTION
       Phoon displays the phase of the moon, either currently or at a
       specified date / time.  Unlike other such programs, which just tell you
       how long since first quarter or something like that, phoon shows you
       the phase with a cute little picture.  You can vary the size of the
       picture with the -l flag, but only some sizes have pictures defined -
       other sizes use @'s.
