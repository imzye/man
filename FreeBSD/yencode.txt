NAME
       ydecode - Usenet file decoder

SYNOPSIS
       ydecode [-d, --debug] [-f, --force] [-k, --keep] [-l, --list] [-o,
       --output=dir] [-p, --paths] [-q, --quiet] [-r, --recursive] [-s,
       --scan] [-t, --test] [--strict] [--verify] [--help] [--version] [FILE]
       ...


DESCRIPTION
       ydecode decodes the files specified on the command line according to
       the yEnc Usenet encoding format.  If no regular files are specified,
       ydecode will scan any directories specified on the command line and/or
       the current directory for yEnc encoded files, and decode them.


OPTIONS
       -d, --debug
              Write messages useful for debugging to stderr while program is
              operating.


       -f, --force
              If the output file already exists, overwrite the existing file
              without prompting.


       -k, --keep
              If an error occurs during the decoding process, do not remove
              the erroneous output file.


       -l, --list
              Only list information about encoded files specified on the
              command line or found during scanning.


       -o, --output=dir
              Create output in dir instead of the current directory.


       -p, --paths
              Obey relative pathnames to files in the encoded data.  For
              example, if an encoded file specifies the output file name as
              files/new/bigfile.mp3, ydecode will by default ignore the paths
              and save the file as bigfile.mp3.  If the -p option is
              specified, the output file will be saved as
              files/new/bigfile.mp3.


       -q, --quiet
              Try to avoid writing output while running.  The only output that
              will occur is error messages.


       -r, --recursive
              When scanning for encoded files, scan directories recursively.


       -t, --test
              Operate as usual, decoding and testing the integrity of all
              input files (or files found during scanning), but do not
              actually create output files.


       --strict
              If this option is requested, more strict checks against the yEnc
              specification will be performed while testing or decoding files.
              The decoded data output will be unaffected, but warning messages
              will be output when non-compliant data is found.  This option is
              highly recommended for individuals who want to implement yEnc
              encoding into their own applications, to test the validity of
              their compressed data.


       --verify
              Synonym for `--test --strict'.


       --help Display program help and exit.


       --version
              Output version number and exit.
