NAME
       Chemistry::Pattern - Chemical substructure pattern matching

SYNOPSIS
           use Chemistry::Pattern;
           use Chemistry::Mol;
           use Chemistry::File::SMILES;

           # Create a pattern and a molecule from SMILES strings
           my $mol_str = "C1CCCC1C(Cl)=O";
           my $patt_str = "C(=O)Cl";
           my $mol = Chemistry::Mol->parse($mol_str, format => 'smiles');
           my $patt = Chemistry::Pattern->parse($patt_str, format => 'smiles');

           # try to match the pattern
           while ($patt->match($mol)) {
               @matched_atoms = $patt->atom_map;
               print "Matched: (@matched_atoms)\n";
               # should print something like "Matched: (a6 a8 a7)"
           }

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements basic pattern matching for molecules.  The
       Chemistry::Pattern class is a subclass of Chemistry::Mol, so patterns
       have all the properties of molecules and can come from reading the same
       file formats. Of course there are certain formats (such as SMARTS) that
       are exclusively used to describe patterns.

       To perform a pattern matching operation on a molecule, follow these
       steps.

       1) Create a pattern object, either by parsing a file or string, or by
       adding atoms and bonds by hand by using Chemistry::Mol methods. Note
       that atoms and bonds in a pattern should be Chemistry::Pattern::Atom
       and Chemistry::Patern::Bond objects. Let's assume that the pattern
       object is stored in $patt and that the molecule is $mol.

       2) Execute the pattern on the molecule by calling $patt->match($mol).

       3) If $patt->match() returns true, extract the "map" that relates the
       pattern to the molecule by calling $patt->atom_map or $patt->bond_map.
       These methods return a list of the atoms or bonds in the molecule that
       are matched by the corresponding atoms in the pattern. Thus
       $patt->atom_map(1) would be analogous to the $1 special variable used
       for regular expresion matching. The difference between
       Chemistry::Pattern and Perl regular expressions is that atoms and bonds
       are always captured.

       4) If more than one match for the molecule is desired, repeat from step
       (2) until match() returns false.

METHODS
       Chemistry::Pattern->new(name => value, ...)
           Create a new empty pattern. This is just like the Chemistry::Mol
           constructor, with one additional option: "options", which expects a
           hash reference (the options themselves are described under the
           options() method).

       $pattern->options(option => value,...)
           Available options:

           overlap
               If true, matches may overlap. For example, the CC pattern could
               match twice on propane if this option is true, but only once if
               it is false. This option is true by default.

           permute
               Sometimes there is more than one way of matching the same set
               of pattern atoms on the same set of molecule atoms. If true,
               return these "redundant" matches.  For example, the CC pattern
               could match ethane with two different permutations (forwards
               and backwards). This option is false by default.

       $patt->reset
           Reset the state of the pattern matching object, so that it begins
           the next match from scratch instead of where it left off after the
           last one.

       $pattern->atom_map
           Returns the list of atoms that matched the last time
           $pattern->match was called.

       $pattern->bond_map
           Returns the list of bonds that matched the last time
           $pattern->match was called.

       $pattern->match($mol, %options)
           Returns true if the pattern matches the molecule. If called again
           for the same molecule, continues matching where it left off (in a
           way similar to global regular expressions under scalar context).
           When there are no matches left, returns false. To force the match
           to always start from scratch instead of continuing where it left
           off, the "reset" option may be used.

               $pattern->match($mol, atom => $atom)

           If atom => $atom is given as an option, match will only look for
           matches that start at $atom (which should be an atom in $mol, of
           course). This is somewhat analog to anchored regular expressions.

           To find out which atoms and bonds matched, use the atom_map and
           bond_map methods.
