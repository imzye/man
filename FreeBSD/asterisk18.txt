ASTDB2BDB(8)                                                      ASTDB2BDB(8)



NAME
       astdb2bdb - convert astdb back to Berkeley DB 1.86

SYNOPSIS
       cd astvarlibdir && astdb2bdb path/to/astdb.sqlite3


DESCRIPTION
       Up until version version 11, Asterisk used an old version of the
       Berkeley DB 1.86 (bdb) to store its internal persistent database. In
       version 11 it switched to using a SQLIte 3 database. This program is
       used to convert the newly-formatted SQLite 3 astdb back to bdb.

       You may need it in case of reverting an upgrade or other similar
       scenarios.


OPTIONS
       There is a single (and required) parameter: the path the the sqlite
       file.  The output file will be a file called astdb in the current
       working directory.


EXAMPLES
       In case you want to revert an upgrade to Asterisk 11, you can do the
       following (while Asterisk is not running):

         cd /var/lib/asterisk && astdb2bdb astdb.sqlite3 && rm astdb.sqlite3

       This will convert the newly-formatted astdb back to the old format, and
       delete it (to avoid obsolete data copies).


NOTES
       Berkeley DB 1.86 is obsolete. It is incompatible with newer versions
       (4.x and newer) that you may see around. Chances are you don't have the
       tools to use it independently of Asterisk.
