NAME
       backupuser - User backup utility

SYNOPSIS
       backupuser [-hijkpruvx] [-d BACKUP] [-s SCP_DESTINATION] [local_disks]
       backupuser [-v] [-s SCP_DESTINATION] etc [local_disks]
       backupuser clean

DESCRIPTION
       backupuser is a shell script utility, that allows a user to create
       backups of his home directory. These backups are placed in
       subdirectories of ${HOME}/backups ordered by year. All other non-option
       arguments, that are passed to backupuser upon invocation, will be
       treated as external storage devices and the utility will attempt to
       copy the backup to the given arguments.

       Any scripts, that may reside in the folder ${HOME}/.bu, will be
       processed in pre- and post-backup stages when being prefixed with the
       words 'pre' and 'post' respectively. If the special file
       ${HOME}/.bu/bu_excludes exists, then any files and folders mentioned in
       this file will not be backed up. To be excluded, files and folders
       should be specified with their full path to file. In case the argument
       "clean" is passed to the utility upon invocation, then backupuser will
       clean the user's backup directory ${HOME}/backups. The following
       special options exist for root: Passing "etc" as a command, causes the
       utility to generate a backup of the system's /etc directory.

       When copying the backup to external storage, backupuser's accompanying
       utility, bu_check_files(1), can be used to generate a fresh reportfile
       on that drive in order to subsequently verify the integrity of the
       backups with the diff(1) utility.


OPTIONS
       -d BACKUP
              delete the backup BACKUP and exit. The respective entry in the
              reportfile will also be deleted if it exists.

       -h     create the archive directly in the destination directory instead
              of going via /tmp. This can be useful on systems where /tmp is
              not available to the user.

       -i     ignore the pre- and post-backup stages.

       -j     do not process the pre-backup stage.

       -k     do not process the post-backup stage.

       -p     generate a list of installed packages/ports in ${HOME} (root
              only).

       -r     do not log the backup in reportfile.

       -s SCP_DESTINATION
              copy the backup via secure shell to SCP_DESTINATION.

       -u     print usage information and exit.

       -v     be more verbose.

       -x     ignore the file bu_excludes if it exists.

EXAMPLES
       1. Backup ${HOME} and copy the backups to external storage devices
       "storage1" and "storage2" respectively:

       backupuser -v /path/to/external/storage1 /path/to/external/storage2

       2. Backup ${HOME} and copy the backup to an external server via SSH:

       backupuser -v -s "-p 2222 user@server.com:/path/to/file"

       3. Clean the user's backup directory ~/backups:

       backupuser clean

       4. Create a backup of the /etc directory as the root user:

       backupuser etc
