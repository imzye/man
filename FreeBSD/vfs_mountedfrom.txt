VFS_MOUNTEDFROM(9)     FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual    VFS_MOUNTEDFROM(9)

NAME
     vfs_mountedfrom – sets the mounted from name for a mount

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <sys/mount.h>

     void
     vfs_mountedfrom(struct mount *mp, const char *from);

DESCRIPTION
     The vfs_mountedfrom() function sets the mounted from name for a mount.
     This value is used by statfs(2) to fill in f_mntfromname.

     In most cases from is the device that contains the file system, but in
     the case of a pseudo file system it could be a descriptive name like
     "devfs" or "procfs".
