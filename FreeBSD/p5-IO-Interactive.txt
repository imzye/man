NAME
       IO::Interactive - Utilities for interactive I/O

VERSION
       This document describes IO::Interactive version 1.02

SYNOPSIS
           use IO::Interactive qw(is_interactive interactive busy);

           if ( is_interactive() ) {
               print "Running interactively\n";
           }

           # or...

           print {interactive} "Running interactively\n";


           $fh = busy {
               do_noninteractive_stuff();
           }

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides three utility subroutines that make it easier to
       develop interactive applications.

       The "ARGV" filehandle, the one that "<>" or an empty readline() uses,
       has various magic associated with it. It's not actually opened until
       you try to read from it. Checking "-t ARGV" before you've tried to read
       from it might give you the wrong answer.  Not only that, you might not
       read from "ARGV". If the value in @ARGV is the magic filename "-" (a
       convention to mean the standard filehandle for input or output), "ARGV"
       might actually be "STDIN".  You don't want to think about all of this.
       This module is discussed in Perl Best Practices on page 218. Also see
       the "ARGV" entry in perlvar and the "readline" entry in perlfunc.

       is_interactive()
           This subroutine returns true if *ARGV and the currently selected
           filehandle (usually *STDOUT) are connected to the terminal. The
           test is considerably more sophisticated than:

               -t *ARGV && -t *STDOUT

           as it takes into account the magic behaviour of *ARGV.

           You can also pass "is_interactive" a writable filehandle, in which
           case it requires that filehandle be connected to a terminal
           (instead of the currently selected). The usual suspect here is
           *STDERR:

               if ( is_interactive(*STDERR) ) {
                   carp $warning;
               }

           Note that "is_interactive" may return true in a Windows Scheduled
           Task. See Github #6
           (https://github.com/briandfoy/io-interactive/issues/6).

       interactive()
           This subroutine returns *STDOUT if "is_interactive" is true. If
           is_interactive() is false, "interactive" returns a filehandle that
           does not print.

           This makes it easy to create applications that print out only when
           the application is interactive:

               print {interactive} "Please enter a value: ";
               my $value = <>;

           You can also pass "interactive" a writable filehandle, in which
           case it writes to that filehandle if it is connected to a terminal
           (instead of writing to *STDOUT). Once again, the usual suspect is
           *STDERR:

               print {interactive(*STDERR)} $warning;

       "busy {...}"
           This subroutine takes a block as its single argument and executes
           that block.  Whilst the block is executed, *ARGV is temporarily
           replaced by a closed filehandle. That is, no input from *ARGV is
           possible in a "busy" block.  Furthermore, any attempts to send
           input into the "busy" block through *ARGV is intercepted and a
           warning message is printed to *STDERR.  The "busy" call returns a
           filehandle that contains the intercepted input.

           A "busy" block is therefore useful to prevent attempts at input
           when the program is busy at some non-interactive task.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Unknown subroutine (%s) requested
           This module only exports the three subroutines described above.
           You asked for something else. Maybe you misspelled the subroutine
           you wanted.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
       IO::Interactive requires no configuration files or environment
       variables.

DEPENDENCIES
       This module requires the openhandle() subroutine from the Scalar::Util
       module.

INCOMPATIBILITIES
       None reported.
