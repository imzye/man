NAME
       Net::DBus - Perl extension for the DBus message system

SYNOPSIS
         ####### Attaching to the bus ###########

         use Net::DBus;

         # Find the most appropriate bus
         my $bus = Net::DBus->find;

         # ... or explicitly go for the session bus
         my $bus = Net::DBus->session;

         # .... or explicitly go for the system bus
         my $bus = Net::DBus->system


         ######## Accessing remote services #########

         # Get a handle to the HAL service
         my $hal = $bus->get_service("org.freedesktop.Hal");

                                        "org.freedesktop.Hal.Manager");

         # List devices
         foreach my $dev (@{$manager->GetAllDevices}) {
             print $dev, "\n";

DESCRIPTION
       Net::DBus provides a Perl API for the DBus message system.  The DBus
       Perl interface is currently operating against the 0.32 development
       version of DBus, but should work with later versions too, providing the
       API changes have not been too drastic.

       Users of this package are either typically, service providers in which
       case the Net::DBus::Service and Net::DBus::Object modules are of most
       relevance, or are client consumers, in which case
       Net::DBus::RemoteService and Net::DBus::RemoteObject are of most
       relevance.

METHODS
       my $bus = Net::DBus->find(%params);
           Search for the most appropriate bus to connect to and return a
           connection to it. The heuristic used for the search is

             - If DBUS_STARTER_BUS_TYPE is set to 'session' attach
               to the session bus

             - Else If DBUS_STARTER_BUS_TYPE is set to 'system' attach
               to the system bus

             - Else If DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS is set attach to the
               session bus

             - Else attach to the system bus

           The optional "params" hash can contain be used to specify
           connection options. The only support option at this time is
           "nomainloop" which prevents the bus from being automatically
           attached to the main Net::DBus::Reactor event loop.

       my $bus = Net::DBus->system(%params);
           Return a handle for the system message bus. Note that the system
           message bus is locked down by default, so unless appropriate access
           control rules are added in /etc/dbus/system.d/, an application may
           access services, but won't be able to export services.

           The optional "params" hash can be used to specify the following
           options:

           nomainloop
               If true, prevents the bus from being automatically attached to
               the main Net::DBus::Reactor event loop.

           private
               If true, the socket opened is private; any existing socket will
               be ignored and any future attempts to open the same bus will
               return a different existing socket or open a fresh one.

       my $bus = Net::DBus->session(%params);
           Return a handle for the session message bus.

           The optional "params" hash can be used to specify the following
           options:

           nomainloop
               If true, prevents the bus from being automatically attached to
               the main Net::DBus::Reactor event loop.

           private
               If true, the socket opened is private; any existing socket will
               be ignored and any future attempts to open the same bus will
               return a different existing socket or open a fresh one.

       my $bus = Net::DBus->test(%params);
           Returns a handle for a virtual bus for use in unit tests. This bus
           does not make any network connections, but rather has an in-memory
           message pipeline. Consult Net::DBus::Test::MockConnection for
           further details of how to use this special bus.

       my $bus = Net::DBus->new($address, %params);
           Return a connection to a specific message bus.  The $address
           parameter must contain the address of the message bus to connect
           to. An example address for a session bus might look like
           "unix:abstract=/tmp/dbus-PBFyyuUiVb,guid=191e0a43c3efc222e0818be556d67500",
           while one for a system bus would look like
           "unix:/var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket".  The optional "params" hash
           can contain be used to specify connection options. The only support
           option at this time is "nomainloop" which prevents the bus from
           being automatically attached to the main Net::DBus::Reactor event
           loop.

       my $connection = $bus->get_connection;
           Return a handle to the underlying, low level connection object
           associated with this bus. The returned object will be an instance
           of the Net::DBus::Binding::Bus class. This method is not intended
           for use by (most!) application developers, so if you don't
           understand what this is for, then you don't need to be calling it!

       my $service = $bus->get_service($name);
           Retrieves a handle for the remote service identified by the service
           name $name. The returned object will be an instance of the
           Net::DBus::RemoteService class.

       my $service = $bus->export_service($name);
           Registers a service with the bus, returning a handle to the
           service. The returned object is an instance of the
           Net::DBus::Service class.

           When $name is not specified or is "undef" then returned handle to
           the service is identified only by the unique name of client's
           connection to the bus.

       my $object = $bus->get_bus_object;
           Retrieves a handle to the bus object, "/org/freedesktop/DBus",
           provided by the service "org.freedesktop.DBus". The returned object
           is an instance of Net::DBus::RemoteObject

       my $name = $bus->get_unique_name;
           Retrieves the unique name of this client's connection to the bus.

       my $name = $bus->get_service_owner($service);
           Retrieves the unique name of the client on the bus owning the
           service named by the $service parameter.

       my $timeout = $bus->timeout(60 * 1000);
           Sets or retrieves the timeout value which will be used for DBus
           requests belongs to this bus connection. The timeout should be
           specified in milliseconds, with the default value being 60 seconds.

DATA TYPING METHODS
       These methods are not usually used, since most services provide
       introspection data to inform clients of their data typing requirements.
       If introspection data is incomplete, however, it may be necessary for a
       client to mark values with specific data types. In such a case, the
       following methods can be used. They are not, however, exported by
       default so must be requested at import time by specifying 'use
       Net::DBus qw(:typing)'

       $typed_value = dbus_int16($value);
           Mark a value as being a signed, 16-bit integer.

       $typed_value = dbus_uint16($value);
           Mark a value as being an unsigned, 16-bit integer.

       $typed_value = dbus_int32($value);
           Mark a value as being a signed, 32-bit integer.

       $typed_value = dbus_uint32($value);
           Mark a value as being an unsigned, 32-bit integer.

       $typed_value = dbus_int64($value);
           Mark a value as being an unsigned, 64-bit integer.

       $typed_value = dbus_uint64($value);
           Mark a value as being an unsigned, 64-bit integer.

       $typed_value = dbus_double($value);
           Mark a value as being a double precision IEEE floating point.

       $typed_value = dbus_byte($value);
           Mark a value as being an unsigned, byte.

       $typed_value = dbus_string($value);
           Mark a value as being a UTF-8 string. This is not usually required
           since 'string' is the default data type for any Perl scalar value.

       $typed_value = dbus_signature($value);
           Mark a value as being a UTF-8 string, whose contents is a valid
           type signature

       $typed_value = dbus_object_path($value);
           Mark a value as being a UTF-8 string, whose contents is a valid
           object path.

       $typed_value = dbus_boolean($value);
           Mark a value as being an boolean

       $typed_value = dbus_array($value);
           Mark a value as being an array

       $typed_value = dbus_struct($value);
           Mark a value as being a structure

       $typed_value = dbus_dict($value);
           Mark a value as being a dictionary

       $typed_value = dbus_variant($value);
           Mark a value as being a variant

       $typed_value = dbus_unix_fd($value);
           Mark a value as being a unix file descriptor
