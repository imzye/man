DESCRIPTION
     The fetch utility provides a command-line interface to the fetch(3)
     library.  Its purpose is to retrieve the file(s) pointed to by the URL(s)
     on the command line.

     The following options are available:

     -1, --one-file
                 Stop and return exit code 0 at the first successfully
                 retrieved file.

     -4, --ipv4-only
                 Forces fetch to use IPv4 addresses only.

     -6, --ipv6-only
                 Forces fetch to use IPv6 addresses only.

     -A, --no-redirect
                 Do not automatically follow ``temporary'' (302) redirects.
                 Some broken Web sites will return a redirect instead of a
                 not-found error when the requested object does not exist.

     -a, --retry
                 Automatically retry the transfer upon soft failures.

     -B bytes, --buffer-size=bytes
                 Specify the read buffer size in bytes.  The default is 16,384
                 bytes.  Attempts to set a buffer size lower than this will be
                 silently ignored.  The number of reads actually performed is
                 reported at verbosity level two or higher (see the -v flag).

     --bind-address=host
                 Specifies a hostname or IP address to which sockets used for
                 outgoing connections will be bound.

     -c dir      The file to retrieve is in directory dir on the remote host.
                 This option is deprecated and is provided for backward
                 compatibility only.

     --ca-cert=file
                 [SSL] Path to certificate bundle containing trusted CA
                 certificates.  If not specified, /usr/local/etc/ssl/cert.pem
                 is used.  If this file does not exist, /etc/ssl/cert.pem is
                 used instead.  If neither file exists and no CA path has been
                 configured, OpenSSL's default CA cert and path settings
                 apply.  The certificate bundle can contain multiple CA
                 certificates.  The security/ca_root_nss port is a common
                 source of a current CA bundle.

     --ca-path=dir
                 [SSL] The directory dir contains trusted CA hashes.

     --cert=file
                 [SSL] file is a PEM encoded client certificate/key which will
                 be used in client certificate authentication.

     --crl=file  [SSL] Points to certificate revocation list file, which has
                 to be in PEM format and may contain peer certificates that
                 have been revoked.

     -d, --direct
                 Use a direct connection even if a proxy is configured.

     -F, --force-restart
                 In combination with the -r flag, forces a restart even if the
                 local and remote files have different modification times.
                 Implies -R.

     -f file     The file to retrieve is named file on the remote host.  This
                 option is deprecated and is provided for backward
                 compatibility only.

     -h host     The file to retrieve is located on the host host.  This
                 option is deprecated and is provided for backward
                 compatibility only.

     -i file, --if-modified-since=file
                 If-Modified-Since mode: the remote file will only be
                 retrieved if it is newer than file on the local host.  (HTTP
                 only)

     --key=file  [SSL] file is a PEM encoded client key that will be used in
                 client certificate authentication in case key and client
                 certificate are stored separately.

     -l, --symlink
                 If the target is a file-scheme URL, make a symbolic link to
                 the target rather than trying to copy it.

     -M

     -m, --mirror
                 Mirror mode: if the file already exists locally and has the
                 same size and modification time as the remote file, it will
                 not be fetched.  Note that the -m and -r flags are mutually
                 exclusive.

     -N file, --netrc=file
                 Use file instead of ~/.netrc to look up login names and
                 passwords for FTP sites.  See ftp(1) for a description of the
                 file format.  This feature is experimental.

     -n, --no-mtime
                 Do not preserve the modification time of the transferred
                 file.

     --no-passive
                 Forces the FTP code to use active mode.

     --no-proxy=list
                 Either a single asterisk, which disables the use of proxies
                 altogether, or a comma- or whitespace-separated list of hosts
                 for which proxies should not be used.

     --no-sslv3  [SSL] Do not allow SSL version 3 when negotiating the
                 connection.  This option is deprecated and is provided for
                 backward compatibility only.  SSLv3 is disabled by default.
                 Set SSL_ALLOW_SSL3 to change this behavior.

     --no-tlsv1  [SSL] Do not allow TLS version 1 when negotiating the
                 connection.

     --no-verify-hostname
                 [SSL] Do not verify that the hostname matches the subject of
                 the certificate presented by the server.

     --no-verify-peer
                 [SSL] Do not verify the peer certificate against trusted CAs.

     -o file, --output=file
                 Set the output file name to file.  By default, a ``pathname''
                 is extracted from the specified URI, and its basename is used
                 as the name of the output file.  A file argument of ‘-’
                 indicates that results are to be directed to the standard
                 output.  If the file argument is a directory, fetched file(s)
                 will be placed within the directory, with name(s) selected as
                 in the default behaviour.

     -P

     -p, --passive
                 Use passive FTP.  These flags have no effect, since passive
                 FTP is the default, but are provided for compatibility with
                 earlier versions where active FTP was the default.  To force
                 active mode, use the --no-passive flag or set the
                 FTP_PASSIVE_MODE environment variable to ‘NO’.

     --referer=URL
                 Specifies the referrer URL to use for HTTP requests.  If URL
                 is set to “auto”, the document URL will be used as referrer
                 URL.

     -q, --quiet
                 Quiet mode.

     -R, --keep-output
                 The output files are precious, and should not be deleted
                 under any circumstances, even if the transfer failed or was
                 incomplete.

     -r, --restart
                 Restart a previously interrupted transfer.  Note that the -m
                 and -r flags are mutually exclusive.

     -S bytes, --require-size=bytes
                 Require the file size reported by the server to match the
                 specified value.  If it does not, a message is printed and
                 the file is not fetched.  If the server does not support
                 reporting file sizes, this option is ignored and the file is
                 fetched unconditionally.

     -s, --print-size
                 Print the size in bytes of each requested file, without
                 fetching it.

     -T seconds, --timeout=seconds
                 Set timeout value to seconds.  Overrides the environment
                 variables FTP_TIMEOUT for FTP transfers or HTTP_TIMEOUT for
                 HTTP transfers if set.

     -U, --passive-portrange-default
                 When using passive FTP, allocate the port for the data
                 connection from the low (default) port range.  See ip(4) for
                 details on how to specify which port range this corresponds
                 to.

     --user-agent=agent-string
                 Specifies the User-Agent string to use for HTTP requests.
                 This can be useful when working with HTTP origin or proxy
                 servers that differentiate between user agents.

     -v, --verbose
                 Increase verbosity level.

     -w seconds, --retry-delay=seconds
                 When the -a flag is specified, wait this many seconds between
                 successive retries.

     If fetch receives a SIGINFO signal (see the status argument for stty(1)),
     the current transfer rate statistics will be written to the standard
     error output, in the same format as the standard completion message.

ENVIRONMENT
     FTP_TIMEOUT   Maximum time, in seconds, to wait before aborting an FTP
                   connection.

     HTTP_TIMEOUT  Maximum time, in seconds, to wait before aborting an HTTP
                   connection.

     See fetch(3) for a description of additional environment variables,
     including FETCH_BIND_ADDRESS, FTP_LOGIN, FTP_PASSIVE_MODE, FTP_PASSWORD,
     FTP_PROXY, ftp_proxy, HTTP_ACCEPT, HTTP_AUTH, HTTP_PROXY, http_proxy,
     HTTP_PROXY_AUTH, HTTP_REFERER, HTTP_USER_AGENT, NETRC, NO_PROXY,
     no_proxy, SSL_CA_CERT_FILE, SSL_CA_CERT_PATH, SSL_CLIENT_CERT_FILE,
     SSL_CLIENT_KEY_FILE, SSL_CRL_FILE, SSL_ALLOW_SSL3, SSL_NO_TLS1,
     SSL_NO_TLS1_1, SSL_NO_TLS1_2, SSL_NO_VERIFY_HOSTNAME and
     SSL_NO_VERIFY_PEER.

EXIT STATUS
     The fetch command returns zero on success, or one on failure.  If
     multiple URLs are listed on the command line, fetch will attempt to
     retrieve each one of them in turn, and will return zero only if they were
     all successfully retrieved.

     If the -i argument is used and the remote file is not newer than the
     specified file then the command will still return success, although no
     file is transferred.

HISTORY
     The fetch command appeared in FreeBSD 2.1.5.  This implementation first
     appeared in FreeBSD 4.1.

AUTHORS
     The original implementation of fetch was done by Jean-Marc Zucconi
     <jmz@FreeBSD.org>.  It was extensively re-worked for FreeBSD 2.2 by
     Garrett Wollman <wollman@FreeBSD.org>, and later completely rewritten to
     use the fetch(3) library by Dag-Erling Smørgrav <des@FreeBSD.org> and
     Michael Gmelin <freebsd@grem.de>.

NOTES
     The -b and -t options are no longer supported and will generate warnings.
     They were workarounds for bugs in other OSes which this implementation
     does not trigger.

     One cannot both use the -h, -c and -f options and specify URLs on the
     command line.
