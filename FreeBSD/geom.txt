GEOM(8)                 FreeBSD System Manager's Manual                GEOM(8)

NAME
     geom – universal control utility for GEOM classes

SYNOPSIS
     geom class help
     geom class list [-a] [name ...]
     geom class status [-ags] [name ...]
     geom class load [-v]
     geom class unload [-v]
     geom -p provider-name
     geom -t

DESCRIPTION
     The geom utility is used to control various GEOM classes.  A class has to
     be aware of geom(8) communication methods, but there are also some
     standard commands which can be used for existing geom(8) unaware classes.
     Here is the list of standard commands:

     help        List all available commands for the given class.

     list        Print detailed information (within the given class) about all
                 geoms (if no additional arguments were specified) or the
                 given geoms.  This command is only available if the given
                 class exists in the kernel.  Additional options include:

                 -a     Print information for geoms without providers.

     status      Print general information (within the given class) about all
                 geoms (if no additional arguments were specified) or the
                 given geoms.  This command is only available if the given
                 class exists in the kernel.

                 Additional options include:

                 -a     When used with -g, print status for geoms without
                        providers.

                 -g     Report statuses for geoms instead of providers.

                 -s     Produce script-friendly output.

     load        Load the kernel module that implements the given class.  This
                 command is only available if the class does not yet exist in
                 the kernel and the file geom_⟨class⟩.ko can be found in one
                 of the directories specified in kern.module_path sysctl.

     unload      Unload the kernel module which implements the given class.
                 This command is only available if the given class is loaded
                 as a kernel module.

     Additional options include:

     -p provider-name
                 Print detailed information about the geom which provides
                 provider-name.

     -t          Display geoms hierarchy as a tree.

     Class-specific commands are implemented as shared libraries which are
     stored in /lib/geom/ directory and are loaded via dlopen(3) function when
     the class name is known.  When a class-specific shared library exists, a
     direct utility should also be available under the name of gclass.

     Currently available classes which are aware of geom(8):

           •   CACHE
           •   CONCAT
           •   ELI
           •   JOURNAL
           •   LABEL
           •   MIRROR
           •   MOUNTVER
           •   MULTIPATH
           •   NOP
           •   PART
           •   RAID
           •   RAID3
           •   SCHED
           •   SHSEC
           •   STRIPE
           •   VIRSTOR

ENVIRONMENT
     The following environment variables affect the execution of geom:

     GEOM_LIBRARY_PATH      Specifies the path where shared libraries are
                            stored instead of /lib/geom/.  Multiple paths can
                            be specified with a colon-separated list of paths.

EXIT STATUS
     Exit status is 0 on success, and 1 if the command fails.

EXAMPLES
     The following example shows how to set up a stripe on three disks for
     automatic configuration:

           geom stripe label -v -s 65536 data /dev/da0 /dev/da1 /dev/da2
           or:
           gstripe label -v -s 65536 data /dev/da0 /dev/da1 /dev/da2

     Print the list of all providers from the DISK class:

           geom disk list

     Unload a kernel module which implements the MD class:

           geom md unload
