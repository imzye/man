Q_QADDI(3)             FreeBSD Library Functions Manual             Q_QADDI(3)

NAME
     Q_QADDI, Q_QDIVI, Q_QMULI, Q_QSUBI, Q_QFRACI, Q_QCPYVALI – fixed-point
     math functions which apply integers to a Q number

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/qmath.h>

     int
     Q_QADDI(QTYPE *a, ITYPE b);

     int
     Q_QDIVI(QTYPE *a, ITYPE b);

     int
     Q_QMULI(QTYPE *a, ITYPE b);

     int
     Q_QSUBI(QTYPE *a, ITYPE b);

     int
     Q_QFRACI(QTYPE *q, ITYPE n, ITYPE d);

     int
     Q_QCPYVALI(QTYPE *q, ITYPE i);

DESCRIPTION
     The Q_QADDI(), Q_QDIVI(), Q_QMULI() and Q_QSUBI() functions add, divide,
     multiply or subtract b to/by/from a respectively, storing the result in
     a.

     The Q_QFRACI() function computes the fraction n divided by d and stores
     the fixed-point result in q.

     The Q_QCPYVALI() function overwrites q's integer and fractional bits with
     the Q representation of integer value i.

     All of those functions operate on the following data types: s8q_t, u8q_t,
     s16q_t, u16q_t, s32q_t, u32q_t, s64q_t, and u64q_t, which are referred to
     generically as QTYPE.  The ITYPE refers to the stdint(7) integer types.

     For more details, see qmath(3).

RETURN VALUES
     Q_QADDI(), Q_QDIVI(), Q_QMULI(), Q_QSUBI(), Q_QFRACI() and Q_QCPYVALI()
     functions return 0 on success, or an errno on failure.  EINVAL is
     returned for divide-by-zero.  EOVERFLOW and ERANGE are returned for
     overflow and underflow respectively.
