DESCRIPTION
       Jed - programmers editor

       Features:

       Color syntax highlighting.  Emulation of Emacs, EDT, Wordstar, and
       Brief editors.  Extensible in a language resembling C. Completely
       customizable.  Editing TeX files with AUC-TeX style editing (BiBTeX
       support too).  Folding support, and much more...

       For complete documentation, see GNU info files, this manual only
       provides brief tutorial.

OPTIONS
   major options
       --version
              prints the version and compiletime variables.
       --help
              prints usage information.
       --secure
              runs Jed in secure mode, e.g. you can't run any external
              commands with system() or run_shell_cmd().
       --batch
              run Jed in batch mode.  This is a non-interactive mode.
       --script
              this is a mode like --batch but jed does not eval the startup
              files. It behaves like slsh.  You must give the file that should
              be evaluated as second argument. It's the same as calling
              jed-script.

   minor options
       -n
              do not load .jedrc file.
       -a 'file'
              load file as user configuration file instead of .jedrc.
       + 'n'
              goto line n in buffer (notice that in order to this option to
              take effect, if must appear before the file name in the command
              line, like 'jed +3 file')
       -g 'n'
              goto line n in buffer (notice that in order to this option to
              take effect, if must appear after the file name in the command
              line, like 'jed file -g 3')
       -l 'file'
              load file as S-Lang code.
       -f 'function'
              execute S-Lang function named function
       -s 'string'
              search forward for string
       -2
              split window
       -i 'file'
              insert file into current buffer.

   X options
       xjed accapts the common options like -display, -name, -fn and
       -geometry.  Additionaly it accepts

       -facesize SIZE, -fs SIZE
              if build with XRENDERFONT support, selects the font size SIZE.
              Use it with the option -fn to select a scalable font.
       -foreground COLOR, -fg COLOR
              sets the foreground color.
       -background COLOR, -bg COLOR
              sets the background color.
       -fgMouse COLOR, -mfg COLOR
              sets the foreground color of the mouse pointer.
       -bgMouse COLOR, -mbg COLOR
              sets the background color of the mouse pointer.
       -Iconic, -ic
              start iconified.
       -title NAME
              sets the window title to NAME.

       For more options look at xterm.c.

CONFIGURATION
              Emulating Other Editors

       JED's ability to create new functions using the S-Lang programming
       language as well as allowing the user to choose key bindings, makes the
       emulation of other editors possible. Currently, JED provides reasonable
       emulation of the Emacs, EDT, and Wordstar editors.

              Emacs Emulation

       Emacs Emulation is provided by the S-Lang code in emacs.sl.  The basic
       functionality of Emacs is emulated; most Emacs users should have no
       problem with JED.  To enable Emacs emulation in JED, make sure that the
       line:

              () = evalfile ("emacs");

       is in your jed.rc (.jedrc) startup file.  JED is distributed with this
       line already present in the default jed.rc file.

              EDT Emulation

       For EDT emulation, edt.sl must be loaded.  This is accomplished by
       ensuring that the line:

              () = evalfile ("edt");

       is in present in the jed.rc (.jedrc) Startup File.

              Wordstar Emulation

       wordstar.sl contains the S-Lang code for JED's Wordstar emulation.
       Adding the line

              () = evalfile ("wordstar");

       to your jed.rc (.jedrc) startup file will enable JED's Wordstar
       emulation.

RUN TIME
              Status line and Windows

       JED supports multiple windows.  Each window may contain the same buffer
       or different buffers.  A status line is displayed immediately below
       each window.  The status line contains information such as the JED
       version number, the buffer name, mode, etc.  Please beware of the
       following indicators:

       **
              buffer has been modified since last save.
       %%
              buffer is read only.
       m
              Mark set indicator.  This means a region is being defined.
       d
              File changed on disk indicator.  This indicates that the file
              associated with the buffer is newer than the buffer itself.
       s
              spot pushed indicator.
       +
              Undo is enabled for the buffer.
       [Narrow]
              Buffer is narrowed to a region of LINES.
       [Macro]
              A macro is being defined.

              Mini-Buffer.

       The Mini-Buffer consists of a single line located at the bottom of the
       screen. Much of the dialog between the user and JED takes place in this
       buffer.  For example, when you search for a string, JED will prompt you
       for the string in the Mini-Buffer.

       The Mini-Buffer also provides a direct link to the S-Lang interpreter.
       To access the interpreter, press Ctrl-X Esc and the S-Lang> prompt will
       appear in the Mini-Buffer.  Enter any valid S-Lang expression for
       evaluation by the interpreter.

       It is possible to recall data previously entered into the Mini-Buffer
       by using the up and down arrow keys.  This makes it possible to use and
       edit previous expressions in a convenient and efficient manner.

              Basic Editing

       Editing with JED is pretty easy - most keys simply insert themselves.
       Movement around the buffer is usually done using the arrow keys or page
       up and page down keys.  If edt.sl is loaded, the keypads on VTxxx
       terminals function as well.  Here, only the highlights are touched upon
       (cut/paste operations are not considered `highlights').  In the
       following, any character prefixed by the ^ character denotes a Control
       character. On keyboards without an explicit Escape key, Ctrl-[ will
       most likely generate and Escape character.

       A prefix argument to a command may be generated by first hitting the
       Esc key, then entering the number followed by pressing the desired key.
       Normally, the prefix argument is used simply for repetition.  For
       example, to move to the right 40 characters, one would press Esc 4 0
       followed immediately by the right arrow key.  This illustrates the use
       of the repeat argument for repetition.  However, the prefix argument
       may be used in other ways as well.  For example, to begin defining a
       region, one would press the Ctrl-@ key.  This sets the mark and begins
       highlighting.  Pressing the Ctrl-@ key with a prefix argument will
       abort the act of defining the region and to pop the mark.

       The following list of useful keybindings assumes that emacs.sl has been
       loaded.

       Ctrl-L
              Redraw screen.
       Ctrl-_
              Undo  (Control-underscore, also Ctrl-X u').

              Reformat paragraph (wrap mode).  Used with a prefix argument.
              will justify the paragraph as well.
       Esc n
              narrow paragraph (wrap mode).  Used with a prefix argument will
              justify the paragraph as well.
