NAME
       Paranoid - Paranoia support for safer programs

VERSION
       $Id: lib/Paranoid.pm, 2.10 2022/03/08 00:01:04 acorliss Exp $

SYNOPSIS
         use Paranoid;

         $errMsg = Paranoid::ERROR;

         psecureEnv("/bin:/usr/bin");

         sub foo {
           # this function can return '0' as a valid return value
           # that should be construed as a boolean true value

           return PTRUE_ZERO;
         }

DESCRIPTION
       This collection of modules started out as modules which perform things
       (debatably) in a safer and taint-safe manner.  Since then it's also
       grown to include functionality that fit into the same framework and
       conventions of the original modules, including keeping the debug hooks
       for command-line debugging.

       All the modules below are intended to be used directly in your programs
       if you need the functionality they provide.

       This module does provide one function meant to secure your environment
       enough to satisfy taint-enabled programs, and as a container which
       holds the last reported error from any code in the Paranoid framework.

IMPORT LISTS
       This module exports the following symbols by default:

           psecureEnv

       The following specialized import lists also exist:

           List        Members
           --------------------------------------------------------
           all         @defaults PTRUE_ZERO

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
   psecureEnv
         psecureEnv("/bin:/usr/bin");

       This function deletes some of the dangerous environment variables that
       can be used to subvert perl when being run in setuid applications.  It
       also sets the path, either to the passed argument (if passed) or a
       default of "/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin".

       NOTE: I did explicitly exclude /usr/local directories from the default
       path for the following reason:  /usr/local is often used by admins to
       stash random scripts and programs which may not have undergone any
       serious scrutiny and review for security issues.  Only the base OS
       directories are presumed as safe, and even that may be stretching the
       truth as it is.  You can override the defaults as desired.

   Paranoid::ERROR
         $errMsg = Paranoid::ERROR;
         Paranoid::ERROR = $errMsg;

       This lvalue function is not exported and must be referenced via the
       Paranoid namespace.

   PTRUE_ZERO
       This is a constant that evaluates to '0 but true', which allows 0 to be
       passed for boolean true use-cases.

TAINT NOTES
       Taint-mode programming can be somewhat of an adventure until you know
       all the places considered dangerous under perl's taint mode.  The
       following functions should generally have their arguments detainted
       before using:

         exec        system      open        glob
         unlink      mkdir       chdir       rmdir
         chown       chmod       umask       utime
         link        symlink     kill        eval
         truncate    ioctl       fcntl       chroot
         setpgrp     setpriority syscall     socket
         socketpair  bind        connect

DEPENDENCIES
       While this module itself doesn't have any external dependencies various
       child modules do.  Please check their documentation for any particulars
       should you use them.
