SND_SBC(4)             FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual             SND_SBC(4)

NAME
     snd_sbc, snd_sb16, snd_sb8 – Creative Sound Blaster ISA and compatible
     bridge device driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device sound
           device snd_sbc
           device snd_sb16
           device snd_sb8

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following lines in loader.conf(5):

           snd_sbc_load="YES"
           snd_sb16_load="YES"
           snd_sb8_load="YES"

     Non-PnP cards require the following lines in device.hints(5):

           hint.sbc.0.at="isa"
           hint.sbc.0.port="0x220"
           hint.sbc.0.irq="5"
           hint.sbc.0.drq="1"
           hint.sbc.0.flags="0x15"

DESCRIPTION
     The snd_sbc bridge driver allows the generic audio driver sound(4) to
     attach to Creative Sound Blaster ISA (mostly SB16 or SB8, known as
     SoundBlaster Pro) compatible audio cards.

     The value of flags specifies the secondary DMA channel.  If the secondary
     DMA channel is C, set the flags to (C | 0x10).  For a sound card without
     the secondary DMA channel, the flags should be set to zero.

     •   Avance Asound 110
     •   Avance Logic ALS100+
     •   Avance Logic ALS120
     •   Creative SB16
     •   Creative SB32
     •   Creative AWE64
     •   Creative AWE64 Gold
