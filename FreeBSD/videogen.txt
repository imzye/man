VIDEOGEN(1)             FreeBSD General Commands Manual            VIDEOGEN(1)

NAME
       videogen - generate Modelines for XFree86 servers

SYNOPSIS
       videogen [-v|-q] [-fb|-nfb] [-nv|-nnv] [-f=<file|->] [-m=<mode>]
       [-mdc=<n>] [-mhf=<n>] [-mvf=<n>] [-dvf=<n>] [-hv=<n>] [-vv=<n>]
       [-hfp=<n>] [-hbp=<n>] [-hsp=<n>] [-vfp=<n>] [-vbp=<n>] [-vsp=<n>]

DESCRIPTION
       videogen can be used to generate Modelines for XFree86 servers to reach
       the highest possible vertical refresh (screen update) rate at all
       resolutions, or to match the refresh rate you desire. As a new feature,
       it can obey the non-free NVidia driver's timing constraints.  It can
       print the calculated results in the Linux framebuffer device format as
       well.

       ATTENTION!  You only have to specify the maximum dot clock, the maximum
       horizontal frequency, the maximum vertical refresh, and of course the
       modes (resolutions) to generate the appropriate Modelines.  The other
       options are only there for tweaking or solving special problems, there
       are hardcoded defaults for them which are suitable for the vast
       majority of cases.

   CONFIGURATION FILE
       A configuration file can be used to specify all or part of the
       parameters needed by videogen to perform its calculations. This can be
       very comfortable in many cases.  You can also specify a configuration
       file path on the command line other than the default (~/.videogen) or
       read from stdin which might be helpful if you want to call videogen
       from another program or from a script.

       The general syntax rules are the following: the parameters can be
       specified using name=value pairs. The parameter names are matched in a
       case insensitive manner. Blanks are optional. More name=value pairs can
       be specified on a single line separated by ";" characters. Any string
       after a "#" character is treated as a comment up to the end of the
       line.

   COMMAND LINE
       The command line options always override the parameters set in the
       configuration file. This also applies to the mode list, so when one or
       more modes are specified on the command line, the entire list of modes
       read from the configuration file is replaced by these.

   OPTIONS
       The command line options are described below together with their
       configuration file variable counterparts (if present).

       -v
       -q
       verbose=on|off
              Turn on/off verbose output. FYI -q stands for quiet ;)
               (default=on)

       -fb
       -nfb
       fbset=on|off
              Turn on/off fbset (Linux framebuffer timings) mode. In this mode
              fbset timings are printed instead of Modelines.
               (default=off)

       -nv
       -nnv
       nvidia=on|off
              Turn on/off non-free NVidia Linux driver compatibility mode.
               (default=on)

       -f=filespec
              Use filespec as the configuration file. This accepts - to read
              the options from the standard input. The "~" character gets
              expanded to the home directory of the user running videogen.
               (default=~/.videogen)

       -m=modespec
       mode=modespec
              Adds modespec to the list of modes to calculate a Modeline for.
              This must be in the form 800x600 (width x height) and it can be
              specified more than once to add several modes.

       -mdc=freq
              Set freq to the maximum dot clock rate of your video card or the
              bandwidth of your monitor, whichever is lower, in MHz.

       -mhf=freq
              Set freq to the maximum horizontal refresh frequency of your
              monitor in kHz.

       -mvf=freq
              Set freq to the maximum vertical refresh frequency of your
              monitor in Hz.

       -dvf=freq
              Set freq to the vertical refresh frequency which you think it
              would be optimal for you, in Hz.  The program will try to match
              this frequency at all resolutions, instead of the maximum
              frequency that would be technically possible. (optional)

       -hv=percent
              Set percent to the percentage of the horizontal frame length you
              want the visible resolution to be. (optional)

       -vv=percent
              Set percent to the percentage of the vertical frame length you
              want the visible resolution to be. (optional)

       -hfp=duration
              Set duration to the horizontal front porch duration of your
              monitor in clock ticks. (optional)

       -hbp=duration
              Set duration to the horizontal back porch duration of your
              monitor in clock ticks. (optional)

       -hsp=duration
              Set duration to the minimum horizontal sync pulse duration of
              your monitor. (optional)

       -vfp=duration
              Set duration to the vertical front porch duration of your
              monitor in clock ticks. (optional)

       -vbp=duration
              Set duration to the vertical back porch duration of your monitor
              in clock ticks. (optional)

       -vsp=duration
              Set duration to the minimum vertical sync pulse duration of your
              monitor. (optional)

   ERRORS
       You can expect the following error codes to be returned by videogen:

       100    system error (memory allocation problems, or other)

       101    command line option error

       102    configuration file error

       103    bad resolution error, currently returned when no (valid) modes
              have been specified anywhere

       104    bad maximum dot clock rate, currently returned when a proper
              value has not been specified anywhere

       105    bad maximum horizontal refresh, currently returned when a proper
              value has not been specified anywhere

       106    bad maximum vertical refresh, currently returned when a proper
              value has not been specified anywhere

   FIXED DOT CLOCKS
       If your display adapter does not have a programmable clockchip then you
       will need to get a list of available clocks somehow and enter these as
       the maximum dot clock frequency. This way videogen will have to adjust
       (decrease) the horizontal refresh frequency to get exactly the given
       dot clock rate. A similar method can be used to match the proper
       frequencies of a fixed frequency monitor.

FILES
       ~/.videogen
              This is the default location for the videogen configuration
              file.

       /usr/X11/lib/X11/XF86Config
              This is the common Xserver configuration file where the
              Modelines generated with videogen can be used. Currently this
              must be done by hand.
