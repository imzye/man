ICMP(4)                FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                ICMP(4)

NAME
     icmp – Internet Control Message Protocol

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/socket.h>
     #include <netinet/in.h>

     int
     socket(AF_INET, SOCK_RAW, proto);

DESCRIPTION
     ICMP is the error and control message protocol used by IP and the
     Internet protocol family.  It may be accessed through a “raw socket” for
     network monitoring and diagnostic functions.  The proto parameter to the
     socket call to create an ICMP socket is obtained from getprotobyname(3).
     ICMP sockets are connectionless, and are normally used with the sendto(2)
     and recvfrom(2) calls, though the connect(2) call may also be used to fix
     the destination for future packets (in which case the read(2) or recv(2)
     and write(2) or send(2) system calls may be used).

     Outgoing packets automatically have an IP header prepended to them (based
     on the destination address).  Incoming packets are received with the IP
     header and options intact.

   Types
     ICMP messages are classified according to the type and code fields
     present in the ICMP header.  The abbreviations for the types and codes
     may be used in rules in pf.conf(5).  The following types are defined:

   MIB Variables
     The ICMP protocol implements a number of variables in the net.inet.icmp
     branch of the sysctl(3) MIB.

     maskrepl            (boolean) Enable/disable replies to ICMP Address Mask
                         Request packets.  Defaults to false.

     maskfake            (unsigned integer) When maskrepl is set and this
                         value is non-zero, it will be used instead of the
                         real address mask when the system replies to an ICMP
                         Address Mask Request packet.  Defaults to 0.

     icmplim             (integer) Bandwidth limit for ICMP replies in
                         packets/second.  If set to zero, no limiting will
                         occur.  Defaults to 200.

     icmplim_output      (boolean) Enable/disable logging of ICMP replies
                         bandwidth limiting.  Defaults to true.

     drop_redirect       (boolean) Enable/disable dropping of ICMP Redirect
                         packets.  Defaults to false.

     log_redirect        (boolean) Enable/disable logging of ICMP Redirect
                         packets.  Defaults to false.

     bmcastecho          (boolean) Enable/disable ICMP replies received via
                         broadcast or multicast.  Defaults to false.

     reply_src           (str) An interface name used for the ICMP reply
                         source in response to packets which are not directly
                         addressed to us.  By default continue with normal
                         source selection.

     reply_from_interface
                         (boolean) Use the IP address of the interface the
                         packet came through in for responses to packets which
                         are not directly addressed to us.  If enabled, this
                         rule is processed before all others.  By default,
                         continue with normal source selection.  Enabling this
                         option is particularly useful on routers because it
                         makes external traceroutes show the actual path a
                         packet has taken instead of the possibly different
                         return path.

     quotelen            (integer) Number of bytes from original packet to
                         quote in ICMP reply.  This number is internally
                         enforced to be at least 8 bytes (per RFC792) and at
                         most the maximal space left in the ICMP reply mbuf.

     tstamprepl          (boolean) Enable/disable replies to ICMP Timestamp
                         packets.  Defaults to true.

ERRORS
     A socket operation may fail with one of the following errors returned:

     [EISCONN]          when trying to establish a connection on a socket
                        which already has one, or when trying to send a
                        datagram with the destination address specified and
                        the socket is already connected;

     [ENOTCONN]         when trying to send a datagram, but no destination
                        address is specified, and the socket has not been
                        connected;

     [ENOBUFS]          when the system runs out of memory for an internal
                        data structure;

     [EADDRNOTAVAIL]    when an attempt is made to create a socket with a
                        network address for which no network interface exists.
