webfsd(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              webfsd(1)

NAME
       webfsd - a lightweight http server

SYNOPSIS
       webfsd [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       This is a simple http server for purely static content.  You can use it
       to serve the content of a ftp server via http for example.  It is also
       nice to export some files the quick way by starting a http server in a
       few seconds, without editing some config file first.

OPTIONS
       -h     Print a short help text and the default values for all options.

       -4     Use IPv4.

       -6     Use IPv6.

       -d     Enable debug output.

       -s     Write a start/stop notice and serious errors to the syslog.
              Specify this option twice to get a verbose log (additional log
              events like dropped connections).

       -t sec Set network timeout to >sec< seconds.

       -c n   Set the number of allowed parallel connections to >n<.  This is
              a per-thread limit.

       -a n   Configure the size of the directory cache.  Webfs has a cache
              for directory listings.  The directory will be reread if the
              cached copy is more than one hour old or if the mtime of the
              directory has changed.  The mtime will be updated if a file is
              created or deleted.  It will not be updated if a file is only
              modified, so you might get outdated time stamps and file sizes.

       -j     Do not generate a directory listing if the index-file isn't
              found.

       -y n   Set the number of threads to spawn (if compiled with thread
              support).

       -p port
              Listen on port >port< for incoming connections.

       -r dir Set document root to >dir<.

       -R dir Set document root to >dir< and chroot to >dir< before start
              serving files.  Note that this affects the path for the access
              log file and pidfile too.

       -f file
              Use >file< as index file for directories.  If a client asks for
              a directory, it will get >file< as response if such a file
              exists in the directory and a directory listing otherwise.
              index.html is a frequently used filename.

       -n hostname
              Set the hostname which the server should use (required for
              redirects).

       -i ip  Bind to IP-address >ip<.

       -l log Log all requests to the logfile >log< (common log format).
              Using "-" as filename makes webfsd print the access log to
              stdout, which is only useful together with the -F switch (see
              below).

       -L log Same as above, but additional flush every line.  Useful if you
              want monitor the logfile with tail -f.

       -m file
              Read mime types from >file<.  Default is
              /usr/local/etc/mime.types.  The mime types are read before
              chroot() is called (when started with -R).

       -k file
              Use >file< as pidfile.

       -u user
              Set uid to >user< (after binding to the tcp port).  This option
              is allowed for root only.

       -g group
              Set gid to >group< (after binding to the tcp port).  This option
              is allowed for root only.

       -F     Don't run as daemon.  Webfsd will not fork into background, not
              detach from terminal and report errors to stderr.

       -b user:pass
              Set user+password for the exported files.  Only a single
              username/password combination for all files is supported.

       -e sec Expire documents after >sec< seconds.  You can use that to make
              sure the clients receive fresh data if the content within your
              document root is updated in regular intervals.  Webfsd will send
              a Expires: header set to last-modified time plus >sec< seconds,
              so you can simply use the update interval for >sec<.

       -v     Enable virtual hosts.  This has the effect that webfsd expects
              directories with the hostnames (lowercase) under document root.
              If started this way: "webfsd -v -r /home/web", it will look for
              the file /home/web/ftp.foobar.org/path/file when asked for
              http://ftp.FOObar.org:8000/path/file.

       -x path
              Use >path< as CGI directory.  >path< is interpreted relative to
              the document root.  Note that CGI support is limited to GET
              requests.

       -S     Secure web server mode. Warning: This mode is strictly for
              https.

       -C     File to use as SSL certificate. This file must be in chained PEM
              format, first the privat RSA key, followed by the certificate.

       -P     Password for accessing the SSL certificate.

       Webfsd can be installed suid root (although the default install isn't
       suid root).  This allows users to start webfsd chroot()ed and to bind
       to ports below 1024.  Webfsd will drop root privileges before it starts
       serving files.

       Access control simply relies on Unix file permissions.  Webfsd will
       serve any regular file and provide listings for any directory it is
       able to open(2).
