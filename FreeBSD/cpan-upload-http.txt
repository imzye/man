NAME
       cpan-upload-http - upload one or more files to CPAN, using PAUSE

SYNOPSIS
       cpan-upload-http [OPTIONS] file1 .. fileN

DESCRIPTION
       cpan-upload-http is a script which automates the process of uploading a
       file to CPAN using PAUSE, the Perl Authors Upload Server.  For example,
       to upload a recent version of the Net::Dict module I ran:

           % cpan-upload-http -verbose Net-Dict-1.07.tar.gz

       If everything went OK, you'll get two mail messages from the PAUSE
       monitor: one to acknowledge the upload, and one to let you know if your
       upload made it through to CPAN.

       Given one or more files to upload, cpan-upload-http carries out the
       following two steps:

       •   HTTP file upload and register the module by POSTing to the PAUSE
           web server.

       This is just one of the ways you can upload something to PAUSE.  See
       the PAUSE FAQ for details (referenced in SEE ALSO section below).

       Before using cpan-upload-http you must register with PAUSE, to get a
       username and password.  If you are a regular uploader to PAUSE, you'll
       probably want to create a ".pause" configuration file, as described in
       "CONFIGURATION FILE" below.  If not, you can just use the command-line
       options, as described in "OPTIONS" below.  If you don't provide your
       password (via configuration file or command-line), then you will be
       prompted for it.  Echo'ing will be turned off while you type your
       password.  This behaviour can be suppressed with the -non_interactive
       option, described below.

OPTIONS
       -user <string>
           Your PAUSE username (which you previously registered with PAUSE).

       -password <string>
           The password for your PAUSE username.

       -directory <string> | -dir <string>
           A subdirectory in your CPAN area where the file should be uploaded
           to.

       -mailto <email>
           Your email address to include the HTTP request header.

       -http_proxy <URL>
           Specifies the URL for a proxy to use when making HTTP requests.

       -non_interactive | -ni
           cpan-upload-http should not prompt for any missing information (eg
           password), it should just warn or die, as appropriate.

       -help
           Displays a short help message with the OPTIONS section from the
           cpan-upload-http documentation.

       -doc
           Display the full documentation for cpan-upload-http.

       -verbose
           Turns on verbose information as the script runs.

       -debug
           Turns on debugging information. Useful mainly for the developer, it
           displays the HTTP request and response.

       -version
           Display the version number of the cpan-upload-http script.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       You can provide the configuration information needed via a .pause file
       in your home directory.  If you upload files at all regularly you will
       want to set up one of these.

       user username
           This is used to specify your PAUSE username.  This just saves you
           from typing it every time you run the script.

       password password
           This is used to specify your PAUSE password.

       directory path
           Specify a subdirectory in your CPAN area.

       http_proxy URL
           The URL for the proxy to use when making HTTP requests to the PAUSE
           web server. For example:

               http_proxy = http://proxy/

       mailto EMAIL
           Specifies the email address which is passed in the header of the
           HTTP request.  You must provide this.

       non_interactive
           Specifies that cpan-upload-http should never prompt the user (eg
           for password), but should take a default action.

       The following is a sample .pause file:

           # example .pause for user neilb
           # the user is your registered PAUSE username
           user NEILB
           password thisisnotmyrealpassword

           mailto      = neil@bowers.com
           http_proxy  = http://proxy.cre.canon.co.uk/

           non_interactive

       Note that your .pause must not be readable by others, since it can
       contain your PAUSE password. The cpan-upload-http script refuses to run
       if your config file can be read by others.

POSSIBLE TODO ITEMS
       Also, let me know if you ever have occasion to wish that the features
       below had been implemented. I probably won't do them unless someone
       would like to see them in.

       I'd be happy to hear any more suggestions.

       •   As with the password, prompt for PAUSE username and email address
           if not provided (by .pause file or on the command-line).

       •   Add configuration options for specifying the URI we POST to.  This
           would let you deal with any changes without requiring a new
           release.  These aren't likely to change on any regular basis, so
           seem gratuitous.
