NAME
       ppthtml - A program for converting Microsoft Power Point Files .ppt


SYNOPSIS
       ppthtml Filename


DESCRIPTION
       This manual page explains the ppthtml program. The program ppthtml is
       used to convert Microsoft Power Point files into either html or tab
       delimitted ASCII. The program can be interfaced with helper scripts for
       viewing email attachments. Most use of this program is through the
       helper scripts and one would probably rarely resort to using the
       commandline interface.


NOTES
       To interface to Netscape Navigator: first locate the help scripts
       nspptview & nsopen. Go into the Edit Preferences dialog box. Click on
       the Navigator Category and hilight the Applications menu item. Look for
       Microsoft Excel Worksheet. If you don't see it create one. The MIME
       type should be:  application/vnd.ms-powerpoint  The suffixes should be:
       ppt,ppa,pps,pot,pwz  In the handled by section of the dialog box, check
       the Application checkbox and set the path to wherever the nspptview
       helper script is located and pass a %s argument. For example, if
       nspptview is located in /usr/local/bin, then you would put:

       /usr/local/bin/nspptview %s

       in the Application path box.. (As a side note, make sure the nspptview
       script can find the ppthtml program or it won't work.)  Click on the OK
       and you are done. You should be able to use the Test.ppt file that is
       distributed with the program to verify its configured correctly.
