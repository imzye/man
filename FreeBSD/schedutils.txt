NAME
       sched,resched,getsched - change a process' scheduler/priority

SYNOPSIS
       sched [-h] [-v] -r|-o|-f priority program [args, ..]

       resched [-h] [-v] -r|-o|-f pid [priority]

       getsched [-h] pid [pid, ...]

DESCRIPTION
       schedutils are some utilities used to manipulate the scheduling and
       priority of processes on *nix  systems. This is realized with the
       functions found in sched.h, see the manpage for sched_setscheduler(2)
       for more info about what's going on.

       sched runs a new program under the specified scheduler and priority,
       resched is used to change the scheduler and/or priority of already
       running processes identified with their pid.  getsched is a little
       utility that prints the scheduler and priority of running processes
       identified with their pid, it does not alter anything. Usually only the
       superuser(root) are allowed to change scheduling parameters.

OPTIONS
       -h print help

       -v be verbose, prints out the  scheduler/priority before and after it's
       changed.

       -r Round Robin scheduler

       -f FIFO scheduler

       -o Other scheduler, this is the 'default' scheduler that normal
       processes start under.

SCHEDULING
       The scheduler is the part of the kernel that decides which process that
       will get the CPU next. Posix defines three diffrent policies that can
       be used to decide this.  See sched_setscheduler for an in-depth
       explanation for the platform you use.

       Other the default timesharing scheduler used by normal processes. The
       'Other' scheduler uses the lowest priority 0 , and  it cannot be set
       higher.

       FIFO First In First Out must have a priority in the range 1-99 and uses
       a simple fifo queue to hold the processes A process that is executed
       will continue to execute until it's either preempted by a process with
       higher priority, gives up the CPU (e.g. by calling sched_yield) or
       performs a call that blocks. Then then next process in the queue can
       run.

       Round Robin must have a priority in the range 1-99 and are very similar
       to FIFO, except it uses timesharing between the processes in the queue,
       a running process will therefore give up the CPU to another process
       with the same priority when it has used its time quantum.

NOTES
       When a process is run under another scheduler than the default (Other)
       it can never be preempted by a process with a lower priority. So, if a
       process run under another scheduler uses the CPU heavily, or worse have
       e.g. a bug that causes it to go in an infinite loop, no other process
       might ever run and the machine might look completely locked, unless
       there is an open shell running somewhere with a even higher priority,
       one can execute commands and possibly kill the process.
