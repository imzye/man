NAME
       cg-comp - This application is part of ( cg3 )

       This tool is part of the CG-3 constraint grammar system:
       https://visl.sdu.dk/cg3.html.

SYNOPSIS
       cg-comp grammar_file [input_file [output_file]]

DESCRIPTION
       cg-comp is the program used to compile constraint grammars from a text
       format to a binary format that results in faster load times. It reads
       the grammar file from input_file and writes output to output_file. The
       binary grammar files generated can be used in the cg-proc(1) and
       vislcg3(1) disambiguators.

SEE ALSO
       cg-proc(1), vislcg3(1)
