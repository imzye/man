NAME
       ccdoc - C++ interface documentation tool

SYNOPSIS
       ccdoc [db file ] [ -switches ] ...

       OR

          phase1: ccdoc [-db file ] [ -phase1_switches ] header_file1 ...
          phase2: ccdoc [-db file ] [-index]
          phase3: ccdoc [-db file ] [-html directory/ ] [ -phase3_switches ]

DESCRIPTION
       ccdoc automatically generates HTML web documentation from C++ programs
       by parsing the source file headers. It was designed to aid
       collaboration between package users and package developers by
       documenting the interface.

       The source code for this program is provided free charge from
       http://ccdoc.sourceforge.net.

       The program operates in three phases. The first phase translates the
       C++ files to an intermediate format that is stored in the db file.  It
       is usually run multiple times over header files in different
       directories and is called the input phase.  This phase automatically
       recognizes the C++ structure to create the documentation but you can
       add additional comments by using directives that have a javadoc like
       syntax.

       The second phase cross indexes all the parsed entities and is called
       the index phase.

       The third phase generates the HTML and is called the output phase.

       Detailed information about the switches, program phases and comment
       syntax can be found in the on-line help or in the users manual at
       http://ccdoc.sourceforge.net.

OPTIONS
       To understand how to use the options for the different phases, see the
       on-line help or the users manual at http://ccdoc.sourceforge.net.

       -D<name>[=<value>]
              Define a macro and, optionally, define its value.


              Phase: parse

       -U<name>
              Undefine a macro.
              Phase: parse

       -args  Dump the command line arguments. This is enabled automatically
              in verbose (-v) mode.


              Phase: all

       -bg <color>
              The background color. The default is the default for the
              browser.


              Phase: output

       -[no]cdsm
              Turn on or off the creation of default special members for
              classes. Specifically this tells ccdoc to create (or not create)
              entries for default constructors, copy constructors, destructors
              and copy operators if they were not explicitly defined in the
              class. The default is -cdsm.


              Phase: parse

       -cid   Deprecated. Same as -verbose.


              Phase: all

       -ctf <file>
              Deprecated. Same as -db.


              Phase: all

       -db <file>
              The name of the ccdoc database.


              Phase: output

       -dospaths
              The file paths contain backslashes that need to be converted to
              forwards slashes for HTML.


              Phase: output

       -[no]doxygen
              Enable limited doxygen compatibility mode. The default is
              -doxygen. This switch specifies that @file blocks are ignored.

              Some other doxygen compatible syntax is already supported
              whether this switch is specified or not, namely: the @endlink
              directive, the single line suffix comment forms (//!< and ///<)
              and the multiple line suffix comment forms (/*!< and /**<).

              This allows users more flexibility in converting between doxygen
              and ccdoc.


              Phase: parse

       -fg <color>
              Same as -fgtext.


              Phase: output

       -fglink <color>
              The foreground link color. The default is the default for the
              browser.


              Phase: output

       -fgtext <color>
              The foreground text color. The default is the default for the
              browser.


              Phase: output

       -fgvlink <color>
              The foreground vlink color. The default is the default for the
              browser. These are used links.


              Phase: output

       -files <list>
              Designates a file that contains the list of files to parse.


              Phase: parse

       -h,-help
              Displays the extensive on-line help and exits. The on-line
              covers the different program phases, the comment directives and
              the program switches.


              Phase: all

       -header <file>
              The HTML used for the customized header just after the <body>
              stmt. This is where clients insert their own custom information
              on each page. See the -meta command for information on how to
              insert meta variables in the <head> section.


              Phase: output

       -htm <prefix>
              Same as -html <prefix>.

       -html <prefix>
              The HTML path prefix. This is used to designate the  path where
              the HTML files will be stored. The directory suffix must be
              included if this is a directory path. Always use a forward slash
              to separate directories, even when you are running under a DOS
              window, because the HTTP path hierarchy separator is a forward
              slash.


              Phase: output

       -imageurl <URL>
              Same as -imgurl <URL>.

       -imgurl <URL>
              The URL that describes of the GIF images. This version of ccdoc
              does not use images so this switch has no effect.


              Phase: output

       -index Generate the indices.
              Phase: index

       -[no]jdsds
              Enable javadoc short description syntax. This causes ccdoc to
              conform to the javadoc specification for processing short
              descriptions.

              This is the new default behavior as of r24.

              A javadoc short description is terminated by a period followed
              by a space, tab, newline or tag (directive).

              If -nojdsds is specified, the old-style ccdoc short description
              handling is enabled. That is, short descriptions are terminated
              by a blank line.


              Phase: parse

       -log <file>
              All information output by the program is also sent to the
              specified log file. Multiple log files can be specified. By
              default all output is sent to cout.


              Phase: all

       -[no]macros
              Deprecated. Same as -[no]rptmac.


              Phase: output

       -maxpathlen <num>
              Maximum file path size. The default is 128. When the file path
              size exceeds the limit, the file name is truncated and a
              checksum is added to guarantee that the file name is unique. If
              maxpathlen is set to zero, no limit checking is performed.


              Phase: output

       -meta <file>
              The HTML used for the customized header just after the <head>
              stmt. This is where clients insert their own custom information
              for meta variables on each page. If -meta is specified, ccdoc
              will not generate the the http-equiv meta variable for HTML 4.01
              compliance and it will ignore the -rptctcs.


              Phase: output

       -nocout
              Turn off output to cout. This is used to test the help output
              without displaying anything to the console.


              Phase: all

       -pkg <name>
              Define the package name for the entities in the source files. If
              no package is specified a default name is used or the @pkg
              <name> directive in the ccdoc comment is used. Children (like
              class methods) inherit the package from their parent.


              Phase: parse

       -[no]private
              Deprecated. Same as -[no]rptpri.


              Phase: output

       -[no]protected
              Deprecated. Same as -[no]rptpro.


              Phase: output

       -[no]public
              Deprecated. Same as -[no]rptpub.


              Phase: output

       -putenv <env>
              Set an environment variable from the command line. This is
              useful for setting up regression tests in scripts on various
              platforms.


              Phase: all

       -root <name>
              Change the name of the root package from 'root' to something
              else.


              Phase: output

       -rootfile <name>
              Change the top level output file name from
              <prefix>ccdoc.root.pkg.html to whatever the user wants. This can
              be used to create the ccdoc.index.html file by specifying:
              -rootfile ccdoc.index.html. This switch allows you to completely
              specify the path. The -html prefix is ignored.


              Phase: output

       -rootpurl
              <URL>
              Phase: output

       -rooturl <URL>
              The hyperlink for the parent of the root package. Setting this
              allows the generated HTML to seamlessly integrate to a higher
              level document by providing a back  link to the users parent
              page.


              Phase: output

       -[no]rptcfuns
              Report comments for undocumented namespaces. When -rptcfuns is
              specified, all related namespaces comments are reported. This
              includes namespaces that do not contain ccdoc comments which can
              be somewhat busy. When -norptcfuns is specified, only related
              namespaces with ccdoc comments are reported. The only exception
              is when none of the namespaces have ccdoc comments. In that
              case, only the first undocumented namespace is reported (for
              backward compatibility). The default is -norptcfuns.


              Phase: output

       -[no]rptcsd
              Report class summary details. When -rptcsd is specified, the
              class summary page reports type, access and short description
              information. When -norptcsd is specified the class summary page
              only reports the names. The default is -rptcsd.


              Phase: output

       -[no]rptcsi <num>
              The class summary indent switch. Define the indent  level of
              each entry in the class summary report and the contents column.
              The default indent level is 4.


              Phase: output

       -rptctcs <string>
              Allow the user to specify the Content-Type char set. This allows
              international languages to be supported. The default char set is


              Phase: output

       -rptdefa <string>
              Set the default string for the author field in top level
              entities. The default is


              Phase: output

       -rptdefasd <string>
              Set the default string for the automatically generated short
              description field in top level entities. The default is


              Phase: output

       -rptdefsd <string>
              Set the default string for the short description field in top
              level entities. The default is


              Phase: output

       -rptdefv <string>
              Set the default string for the version field in top level
              entities. The default is


              Phase: output

       -[no]rptdpa
              If the package author is not specified, report the author as
              unascribed. The default is -norptdpa which tells ccdoc to ignore
              authors on packages unless they are explicitly specified.


              Phase: output

       -[no]rptdpd
              If the package description is not specified, report the
              description as unknown. The default is -norptdpd which tells
              ccdoc to ignore descriptions on packages unless they are
              explicitly specified.


              Phase: output

       -[no]rptdpv
              If the package version is not specified, report the version as
              unknown. The default is -norptdpv which tells ccdoc to ignore
              version on packages unless they are explicitly specified.


              Phase: output

       -[no]rptfwcf
              The fixed width code font switch. Use a fixed width  font when
              reporting code fragments. The default is -norptfwcf.


              Phase: output

       -[no]rpthpc
              Report package contents hierarchically like the the class
              summary page. The default is -rpthpc.


              Phase: output

       -[no]rptim
              Report all inherited methods as though they were defined
              locally. The default is -rptim.


              Phase: output

       -[no]rptmac
              Report macros. Default is -norptmac because there can be large
              numbers of guards in header files. If a system is designed with
              ccdoc in mind, the header guards can be surrounded by ccdoc
              guards (#ifndef __ccdoc__) which would make this data more
              useful.


              Phase: output

       -[no]rptmac1
              Report macros heuristically. This means that ccdoc attempts to
              filter out header guards and windows DLLIMPORT/DLLEXPORT macros
              by filtering out macro names with the prefixes: dll_, DLL_,
              include_, INCLUDE_, included_, INCLUDED_ and the suffixes: dll,
              _DLL, _h, _H, _hh, _HH, _include, _INCLUDE, _included,
              _INCLUDED, _included_, _INCLUDED_.

              The default is -norptmac1. When this switch is enabled, it also
              enables -rptmac. This is a better choice than -rptmac.


              Phase: output

       -rptmlci <num>
              Maximum length of the content ids. This switch is used to avoid
              strange looking tables of content when the id is very long.

              When the string exceeds this length, only the first <num>
              characters are printed followed by .. to indicate truncation.

              The default length is 32. A value of zero means don't impose the
              limit. If no inherited from column exists, the value of the
              -rptmlcifi is added to make this field bigger.


              Phase: output

       -rptmlcifi <num>
              Maximum length of the contents

              When the string exceeds this length, only the first <num>
              characters are printed followed by .. to indicate truncation.

              The default length is 32. A value of zero means don't impose the
              limit.


              Phase: output

       -[no]rptpri
              Report private items. The default is -norptpri.


              Phase: output

       -[no]rptpro
              Report protected items. The default is -norptpro.


              Phase: output

       -[no]rptpub
              Report public items. The default is -rptpub.


              Phase: output

       -[no]rptsci
              Report the class information in sorted order. The default is
              -rptsci. If -norptsci is specified the class contents and
              details are not sorted.


              Phase: output

       -[no]rptsrc
              Report the source information for each entity in the table of
              contents. This causes an additional column to be added to the
              table. The default is -norptsrc because this information is
              already reported for each entity in its description. It exists
              to provide debugging support for when no description is
              generated.


              Phase: output

       -[no]rpttyp
              Report typedefs. Default is -rpttyp.


              Phase: output

       -[no]rptun
              Report unions. Default is -rptun.


              Phase: output

       -sourceurl <URL>
              Same as -srcurl <URL>.

       -srcurl <URL>
              The URL where the source files can be found. If this is
              specified, hyperlinks are created for Source entries.


              Phase: output

       -[no]tcms
              Turn on or off the processing of template class methods that are
              defined outside of the class declaration.


              Phase: parse

       -trailer <file>
              The HTML used for the customized trailer.


              Phase: output

       -[no]typedefs
              Deprecated. Same as -[no]rpttyp.


              Phase: output

       -[no]unions
              Deprecated. Same as -[no]rptun.
              Phase: output

       -[no]v Turn verbose mode on or off. The default is off.


              Phase: all

       -version
              Report the program version. The version contains the program
              name, the version, the revision, the release date and the
              compilation id. Here is an example of what -version reports: %
              ccdoc -version ccdoc v08r41 2004/09/29
              bin_opt_msvc_MSWin32-multi-thread-4.0


              Phase: all

       -[no]vf
              Turn db verbose format mode on or off. The default is on because
              it speeds up the writing significantly and is only slightly
              larger. This switch enables verbose mode in the database file to
              make things easier to read for debugging.


              Phase: all

       -[no]warn
              Turn warnings on or off. The default is on.
              Phase: all

DIRECTIVES
       These are the directives that drive the output format.  They are found
       in the comments associated with the entities.  The basic format is:

          /**
           *<brief_description>
           *<long_description>
           *<directives>
           */

       Where the brief description is a single sentence terminated by a
       period, the long description is anything else, including HTML tags and
       the directives are special ccdoc tags.

       These comments are associated with C++ entity declarations for classes,
       variables, functions, enumerated types and typedefs as shown in the
       simple example below for a class.

          /**
           * Briefly, do important foo stuff.
           * Long winded, do really important foo stuff.
           * @author Ima Programmer
           * @version 1.2
           * @see Bar
