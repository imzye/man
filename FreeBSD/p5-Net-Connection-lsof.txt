Net::Connection::lsof(3)                   User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Net::Connection::lsof - This uses lsof to generate a array of
       Net::Connection objects.

VERSION
       Version 0.2.0

SYNOPSIS
           use Net::Connection::lsof;

           my @objects;
           eval{ @objects = &lsof_to_nc_objects; };

           # this time don't resolve ports, ptrs, or usernames
           my $args={
                    ports=>0,
                    ptrs=>0,
                    uid_resolve=>0,
                    };
           eval{ @objects = &lsof_to_nc_objects($args); };

SUBROUTINES
   lsof_to_nc_objects
       This runs 'lsof -i UDP -i TCP -n -l -P' and parses the output returns a
       array of Net::Connection objects. If a non-zero exit code is returned,
       it will die.

       There is one optional argument and that is hash reference that can take
       several possible keys.

       args hash

       ports

       uid_resolve
