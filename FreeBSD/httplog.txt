HTTPLOG
       httplog - Apache webserver logfile rollover program


SYNOPSIS
       httplog [-z] [-u USER] [-g GROUP] [-s SYMLINK] [-b BUFFER_SIZE] LOGFILE


DESCRIPTION
       This program makes Apache act similar to Microsofts' IIS webserver in
       its logging style (as opposed to every logfile entry in one single huge
       logfile).  This allows you to easily maintain your webserver logfiles
       for statistics packages in an easily organizable manner without user
       intervention.


USAGE
       It takes one argument at the command line, the path to a logfile as a
       template.  The template pathname can use any valid special characters
       permitted in strftime(3).  Other optional arguments can be appended to
       the command line.

       Optional filename parsing flags that may be used alongside the
       strftime(3) flags are:

       %1     replaced with systems host name.

       %2     replaced with systems domain name.

       %3     replaced with systems fully qualified name.



OPTIONS
       -h     output short help message and exit.

       -z     Compress logfiles with zlib once logfile rollover period hits
              and new logfile is generated.

       -u USER
              Run as specified user rather than current user (typically root).

       -g GROUP
              Run as specified group rather than current group (typically
              root).

       -s SYMLINK
              Create a symlink to the currently active logfile.  This symlink
              does not have to be in the same directory as the currently
              active logfile, and % expandoes do not expand in the symlink
              filename.

       -b BUFFER_SIZE
              Use specified buffer size to buffer logfile data rather than
              default buffer size defined by your system at compile time by
              BUFSIZ.  This option also changes buffer flush style from line
              buffer mode to full buffer mode.


REQUIRES
       You must have Apache installed.  This program has not been tested with
       any other webserver software.
       To be able to use the -z option, you must have zlib installed on your
       system before compiling httplog.
