NAME
       HTML::ExtractMain - Extract the main content of a web page

VERSION
       Version 0.62

SYNOPSIS
           use HTML::ExtractMain qw( extract_main_html );

           my $html = <<'END';
           <div id="header">Header</div>
           <div id="nav"><a href="/">Home</a></div>
           <div id="body">
               <p>Foo</p>
               <p>Baz</p>
           </div>
           <div id="footer">Footer</div>
           END

           my $main_html = extract_main_html($html);
           if (defined $main_html) {
               # do something with $main_html here
               # $main_html is '<div id="body"><p>Foo</p><p>Baz</p></div>'
           }

EXPORT
       "extract_main_html" is optionally exported

FUNCTIONS
   extract_main_html
       "extract_main_html" takes HTML content, and uses the Readability
       algorithm to detect the main body of the page, usually skipping
       headers, footers, navigation, etc.

       It takes a single argument, either an HTML string, or an
       HTML::TreeBuilder tree. (If passed a tree, the tree will be modified
       and destroyed.)

       If the HTML's main content is found, it's returned as an XHTML snippet.
       The returned HTML will not look like what you put in.  (Source
       formatting, e.g. indentation, will be removed, and you may get back
       XHTML when you put in HTML.)

       If a most relevant block of content is not found, "extract_main_html"
       returns undef.
