NAME
       args - manipulate and output command arguments.

SYNOPSIS
       args [options] args...

DESCRIPTION
       This command is used to manipulate and echo command line arguments to
       standard out.  This can include adding quotes around each argument
       passed or a separator, or to output each argument on a separate line.
       The program source also offers a basic example of how to use shell
       argument parsing and localization in ucommon.

OPTIONS
       --delim=char
              Set a deliminator character, such as ',', to use between each
              argument when outputing arguments.

       --directory
              If argument is a directory, list directory contents as
              arguments.

       --follow
              If argument is a directory and a symlink, follow symlinks
              recursively.

       --lines
              Output each argument on a separate line.

       --quote=char|pair
              Set a quote or special leading and trailing pair of characters
              to surround each argument with when output.  A typical use might
              be --quote=() to surround arguments in parenthesis.

       --recursive
              If argument is a directory, recursively scan directory and any
              subdirectory contents as arguments.

       --reverse
              Reverse order of arguments.

       --help Outputs help screen for the user.
