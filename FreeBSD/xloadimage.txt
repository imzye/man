UUFILTER(1x)                                                      UUFILTER(1x)

NAME
       uufilter - decode uuencoded files to stdout

SYNOPSIS
       uufilter [-f outfilename] [-l] [-s] [-v] [infilename]

DESCRIPTION
       Uufilter is a "smart" uuencoded file decoder that can optionally dump
       the file to stdout.

       If no filename is supplied, input is read from stdin.

       Uufilter automatically ignores lines that do not appear to be part of
       the uuencoded file.  This is particularly useful in uudecoding files
       that have been concatenated from several email or news postings without
       stripping off the headers or otherwise editing extraneous content.

OPTIONS
       -f filename
               Dump output to filename rather than the name specified in the
               uuencoded file.

       -l      Lenient mode.  This is useful if passed through a mailer that
               adds trailing spaces.

       -s      Dump output to stdout rather than to the filename indicated in
               the uuencoded file.

       -v      Verbose mode; talks about what's going on.
