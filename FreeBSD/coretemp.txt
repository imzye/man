NAME
     coretemp – device driver for Intel Core on-die digital thermal sensor

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following line in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device coretemp

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the

DESCRIPTION
     The coretemp driver provides support for the on-die digital thermal
     sensor present in Intel Core and newer CPUs.

     The coretemp driver reports each core's temperature through a sysctl node
     in the corresponding CPU device's sysctl tree, named
     dev.cpu.%d.temperature.
