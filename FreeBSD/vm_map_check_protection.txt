VM_MAP_CHECK_PROTECTION(9)                   FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual

NAME
     vm_map_check_protection – check memory protection for a vm_map

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <vm/vm.h>
     #include <vm/vm_map.h>

     boolean_t
     vm_map_check_protection(vm_map_t map, vm_offset_t start, vm_offset_t end,
         vm_prot_t protection);

DESCRIPTION
     The vm_map_check_protection() function asserts that the target map allows
     the specified privilege protection over the entire address range from
     start to end.  The region MUST be contiguous; no holes are allowed.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
     This code does not and SHOULD not check whether the contents of the
     region are accessible.  For example, a small file may be mapped into an
     address space which is significantly larger in size.

RETURN VALUES
     The vm_map_check_protection() function returns TRUE if the privilege is
     allowed; if it is not allowed, or if any other error occurred, the value
     FALSE is returned.
