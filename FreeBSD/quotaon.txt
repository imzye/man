QUOTAON(8)              FreeBSD System Manager's Manual             QUOTAON(8)

NAME
     quotaon, quotaoff – turn file system quotas on and off

SYNOPSIS
     quotaon [-g] [-u] [-v] filesystem ...
     quotaon [-g] [-u] [-v] -a
     quotaoff [-g] [-u] [-v] filesystem ...
     quotaoff [-g] [-u] [-v] -a

DESCRIPTION
     The quotaon utility announces to the system that disk quotas should be
     enabled on one or more file systems.  The quotaoff utility announces to
     the system that the specified file systems should have any disk quotas
     turned off.  The file systems specified must have entries in /etc/fstab
     and be mounted.  The quotaon utility expects each file system to have
     quota files named quota.user and quota.group which are located at the
     root of the associated file system.  These defaults may be overridden in
     /etc/fstab.  By default both user and group quotas are enabled.

     Available options:

     -a      If supplied in place of any file system names, quotaon/quotaoff
             will enable/disable all the file systems indicated in /etc/fstab
             to be read-write with disk quotas.  By default only the types of
             quotas listed in /etc/fstab are enabled.

     -g      Only group quotas listed in /etc/fstab should be
             enabled/disabled.

     -u      Only user quotas listed in /etc/fstab should be enabled/disabled.

     -v      Cause quotaon and quotaoff to print a message for each file
             system where quotas are turned on or off.

     Specifying both -g and -u is equivalent to the default.

FILES
     quota.user   at the file system root with user quotas
     quota.group  at the file system root with group quotas
