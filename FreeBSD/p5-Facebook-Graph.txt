NAME
       Facebook::Graph - A fast and easy way to integrate your apps with
       Facebook.

VERSION
       version 1.1205

NOTICE OF DEPRECATION
       Facebook::Graph brought the world of Facebook to Perl, but as Facebook
       is massively changing their APIs it is impossible to keep up with a
       heavy weight module like Facebook::Graph. Instead, we recommend
       switching to the lighter weight Facebook::OpenGraph module. We won't be
       removing Facebook::Graph from CPAN, but we won't be adding new features
       to keep up with all of Facebook's constant changes either.

SYNOPSIS
        my $fb = Facebook::Graph->new;
        $fb->access_token($token);
        my $sarah_bownds = $fb->fetch('767598108');
        my $perl_page = $fb->fetch('16665510298');

       Or better yet:

        my $sarah_bownds = $fb->query
           ->find('767598108')
           ->include_metadata
           ->select_fields(qw( id name picture ))
           ->request
           ->as_hashref;

        my $sarahs_picture_uri = $fb->picture('sarahbownds')->get_large->uri_as_string;

       You can also do asynchronous calls like this:

        my $sarah = $fb->query->find('767598108');             # making request in background here
        # ... do stuff here ...
        my $hashref = $sarah->as_hashref;                      # handling the response here

       Or fetching a response from a URI you already have:

        my $hashref = $fb->request('https://graph.facebook.com/16665510298')->as_hashref;

   Building A Privileged App
        my $fb = Facebook::Graph->new(
           app_id          => $facebook_application_id,
           secret          => $facebook_application_secret,
           postback        => 'https://www.yourapplication.com/facebook/oauth/postback',
        );

       Get the user to authorize your app (only needed if you want to fetch
       non-public information or publish stuff):

        my $uri = $fb
           ->authorize
           ->extend_permissions(qw(offline_access publish_stream))
           ->uri_as_string;

        # redirect the user's browser to $uri

       Handle the Facebook authorization code postback:

        my $q = Plack::Request->new($env);
        $fb->request_access_token($q->query_param('code'));

        #now retrieve extended access token
        $fb->request_extended_access_token; #extended access token now in $fb->access_token

       Or if you already had the access token:

        $fb->access_token($token);
        $fb->request_extended_access_token;

       Or simply:

        $fb->request_extended_access_token($token);

       Get some info:

        my $user = $fb->fetch('me');
        my $friends = $fb->fetch('me/friends');
        my $perl_page = $fb->fetch('16665510298');

       Use a different version of the API:

        my $user = $fb->fetch('me', api_version => 'v2.5');

DESCRIPTION
       This is a Perl interface to the Facebook Graph API
       <http://developers.facebook.com/docs/api>. With this module you can
       currently query public Facebook data, query privileged Facebook data,
       and build a privileged Facebook application. See the TODO for all that
       this module cannot yet do.

       For example code, see Facebook::Graph::Cookbook.

       WARNING: The work on this module has only just begun because the Graph
       API itself isn't very new, and I'm only working on it as I have some
       tuits. Therefore things are potentially subject to change drastically
       with each release.

METHODS
   new ( [ params ] )
       The constructor.

       params

       A hash of base parameters, just so you don't have to pass them around.
       If you only want to do public queries then these params are not needed.

       access_token
           An access token string used to make Facebook requests as a
           privileged user. Required if you want to make privileged queries or
           perform privileged actions on Facebook objects.

       app_id
           The application id that you get from Facebook after registering
           (<http://developers.facebook.com/setup/>) your application on their
           site. Required if you'll be calling the "request_access_token",
           "convert_sessions", or "authorize" methods.

       secret
           The application secret that you get from Facebook after registering
           your application. Required if you'll be calling the
           "request_access_token" or "convert_sessions" methods.

       postback
           The URI that Facebook should post your authorization code back to.
           Required if you'll be calling the "request_access_token" or
           "authorize" methods.

           NOTE: It must be a sub URI of the URI that you put in the
           Application Settings > Connect > Connect URL field of your
           application's profile on Facebook.

   authorize ( )
       Creates a Facebook::Graph::Authorize object, which can be used to get
       permissions from a user for your application.

   request_access_token ( code )
       Creates a Facebook::Graph::AccessToken object and fetches an access
       token from Facebook, which will allow everything you do with
       Facebook::Graph to work within user privileges rather than through the
       public interface. Returns a Facebook::Graph::AccessToken::Response
       object, and also sets the "access_token" property in the
       Facebook::Graph object.

   request_extended_access_token ( access_token )
       Note: access_token is optional. Creates a Facebook::Graph::AccessToken
       object and fetches an
       (https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/access-tokens/#extending)
       extended access token from Facebook.  This method accepts an optional
       access token. If you have called "request_access_token" already on the
       Facebook::Graph object and "access_token" is set, then you do not have
       to pass in an access token. However, if you have an access token stored
       from a previous object, you will need to pass it in.

       code

       An authorization code string that you should have gotten by going
       through the "authorize" process.

   query ( )
       Creates a Facebook::Graph::Query object, which can be used to fetch and
       search data from Facebook.

   batch_requests ( uri )
       Creates a Facebook::Graph::BatchRequests object, which can be used to
       send multiple requests in a single HTTP request.

   request ( uri )
       Fetch a Facebook::Graph URI you already have.

       uri

       The URI to fetch. For example: https://graph.facebook.com/amazon

   fetch ( id )
       Returns a hash reference of an object from facebook. A quick way to
       grab an object from Facebook. These two statements are identical:

        my $sarah = $fb->fetch('767598108');

        my $sarah = $fb->query->find('767598108')->request->as_hashref;

       id

       An object id like 16665510298 for the Perl page.

   picture ( id )
       Returns a Facebook::Graph::Picture object, which can be used to
       generate the URLs of the pictures of any object on Facebook.

       id

       An object id like 16665510298 for the Perl page.

   add_post ( [ id ] )
       Creates a Facebook::Graph::Publish::Post object, which can be used to
       publish data to a user's feed/wall.

   add_page_feed ( )
       Creates a Facebook::Graph::Page::Feed object, which can be used to add
       a post to a Facebook page.

   add_photo ( [ id ] )
       Creates a Facebook::Graph::Publish::Photo object, which can be used to
       publish a photo to a user's feed/wall.

       id

       Optionally provide an object id to place it on. Requires that you have
       administrative access to that page/object.

   add_checkin ( [ id ] )
       Creates a Facebook::Graph::Publish::Checkin object, which can be used
       to publish a checkin to a location.

       id

       Optionally provide an user id to check in. Requires that you have
       administrative access to that user.

   add_comment ( id )
       Creates a Facebook::Graph::Publish::Comment object that you can use to
       comment on a note.

       id

       The id of the post you want to comment on.

   add_page_tab ( page_id, app_id )
       Creates a Facebook::Graph::Publish::PageTab object, which can be used
       to publish an app as a page tab.

       id

       Optionally provide an object id to place it on. Requires that you have
       administrative access to that page/object.

   rsvp_maybe ( id )
       RSVP as 'maybe' to an event.

       id

       The id of an event.

   rsvp_attending ( id )
       RSVP as 'attending' to an event.

       id

       The id of an event.

   rsvp_declined ( id )
       RSVP as 'declined' to an event.

       id

       The id of an event.

   convert_sessions ( sessions )
       A utility method to convert old sessions into access tokens that can be
       used with the Graph API. Returns an array reference of hash references
       of access tokens.

        [
          {
            "access_token": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
            "expires": 1271649600,
          },
          ...
        ]

       See also Facebook::Graph::Session.

       sessions

       An array reference of session ids from the old Facebook API.

   parse_signed_request ( $signed_request )
       Allows the decoding of signed requests for canvas applications to
       ensure data passed back from Facebook isn't tampered with. You can read
       more about this at
       <http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/canvas>.

       $signed_request

       A signature string passed from Facebook. To capture a signed request
       your app must be displayed within the Facebook canvas page and then you
       must pull the query parameter called "signed_request" from the query
       string.

       NOTE: To get this passed to your app you must enable it in your
       migration settings for your app
       (<http://www.facebook.com/developers/>).

EXCEPTIONS
       This module throws exceptions when it encounters a problem. It uses
       Ouch to throw the exception, and the Exception typically takes 3 parts:
       code, message, and a data portion that is the URI that was originally
       requested. For example:

        eval { $fb->call_some_method };
        if (kiss 500) {
          say "error: ". $@->message;
          say "uri: ".$@->data;
        }
        else {
          throw $@; # rethrow the error
        }

CAVEATS
       The Facebook Graph API is a constantly moving target. As such some
       stuff that used to work, may stop working. Keep up to date with their
       changes here: <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/upgrading>

       If you were using any version of Facebook::Graph before 1.1000, then
       you may be used to doing things like creating events through this API,
       or using a person's username instead of their ID, or making queries
       without an access token. You can't do any of those things anymore,
       because as of the Facebook Graph v2.0 API, none of them is supported
       any longer.

PREREQS
       Moo JSON LWP::UserAgent LWP::Protocol::https URI DateTime
       DateTime::Format::Strptime MIME::Base64::URLSafe Ouch

   Optional
       Digest::SHA is used for signed requests. If you don't plan on using the
       signed request feature, then you do not need to install Digest::SHA.
