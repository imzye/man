RACKET(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              RACKET(1)

NAME
       racket - core Racket implementation

SYNOPSIS
       racket [ option ...  ] [ argument ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Run

          racket --help

       for a list of command-line options and other start-up information.


       Supplying no arguments to racket is the same as supplying the -i option
       for interactive evaluation.


       Supplying non-switch, non-configuration arguments to racket is the same
       as putting -u before the arguments to run the first one as a module-
       based script.
