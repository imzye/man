Business::ISBN::Data(3)                    User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Business::ISBN::Data - data pack for Business::ISBN

SYNOPSIS
       see Business::ISBN

DESCRIPTION
       You don't need to load this module yourself in most cases.
       Business::ISBN will load it when it loads. You must use Business::ISBN
       3.005 or later because the data structure changed slightly to fix a bug
       with ISBN13 prefixes.

       These data are generated from the RangeMessage.xml file provided by the
       ISBN Agency. The distributed version matches the date in the version
       for this module. You can retrieve this yourself at
       <https://www.isbn-international.org/range_file_generation>.  This file
       is included as part of the distribution and should be installed at
       ~lib/Business/ISBN/Data/RangeMessage.xml.

       If you want to use a different RangeMessage.xml file, you can set the
       "ISBN_RANGE_MESSAGE" environment variable to the alternate location
       before you load "Business::ISBN". This way, you can use the latest (or
       even earlier) data without having to install something new or wait for
       an update to this module.

       If the default RangeMessage.xml or your alternate one is not available,
       the module falls back to data included in Data.pm. However, that data
       are likely to be older. If it does not find that file, it looks for
       RangeMessage.xml in the current directory.

       The data are in %Business::ISBN::country_data (although the "country"
       part is historical). If you want to see where the data are from, check
       $Business::ISBN::country_data{_source}.

   Packaging this module
       The included RangeMessage.xml is in under lib/ at the same level as
       Data.pm. The same data exist as the default data in the code, so you
       don't need to pass along the distributed RangeMessage.xml.  However,
       you can include a newer RangeMessage.xml.

       With PAR, you can add extra files to the archive with "-a". Put the new
       file somewhere the module will find it (or use "ISBN_RANGE_MESSAGE" to
       lead it there):

               pp ... -a '..../RangeMessage.xml;RangeMessage.xml'

       If you put the RangeMessage.xml in the current working directory of the
       application, the module should find it.

   Updating the default data
       In the repo, find the examples/make_default_data.pl program. Run that
       against the latest RangeMessage.xml:

               % perl -Ilib examples/make_default_data.pl RangeMessage.xml

       That produces the code you need to replace in the module. Check that
       that data aren't weird: sometimes the group names have errors or
       oddities. The program handles escaping single quotes and trimming white
       space.

       Yakov Shafranovich updated the data in October 2008.

       Daniel Jakubik updated the data in July 2012.

       Markus Spann suggested looking for RangeMessage.xml in the current
       directory to make it work with Perl app bundlers.

       Josef Moravec "<josef.moravec@gmail.com>" updated the data in January
       2019.

       Peter Williams fixed a serious issue with ISBN-13 (GitHub #5). You must
       use Business::ISBN 3.005 or later because the data structure changed.
