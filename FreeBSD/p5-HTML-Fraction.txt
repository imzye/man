NAME
       HTML::Fraction - Encode fractions as HTML entities

SYNOPSIS
         my $fraction = HTML::Fraction->new;
         print $fraction->tweak($html);

DESCRIPTION
       The HTML::Fraction encodes fractions as HTML entities. Some very common
       fractions have HTML entities (eg "1/2" is &frac12;). Additionally,
       common vulgar fractions have Unicode characters (eg "1/5" is
       "&#8533;"). This module takes a string and encodes fractions as
       entities: this means that it will look pretty in the browser.

       Fractions that are supported:

         1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 0/3, 1/3, 2/3, 1/5, 2/5, 3/5,
         4/5, 1/6, 5/6, 1/7, 1/8, 3/8, 5/8, 7/8, 1/9, 1/10

       Fractions may be in the string in the form numerator slash denominator
       ("1/5") or in decimal form (0.5).  Numbers must be equal to the
       fraction to two decimal places.  This module supports converting whole
       and fractional decimal numbers (e.g. 2.25.)

       For sanity the decimal 0 will not be turned into the unicode for "0/3"

CONSTRUCTOR
   new
       The constructor takes no arguments:

         my $fraction = HTML::Fraction->new;

METHODS
   tweak
       Encode the fractions in the HTML as HTML entities:

         print $fraction->tweak($html);

   tweak_frac
       Encode the fractions that are in the form "1/3" or "5/6" in the HTML as
       HTML entities, but not decimal fractions of the form "0.5".

   tweak_dec
       Encode the fractions that are in the form "0.5" or "0.5" in the HTML as
       HTML entities, but not fractions of the form "1/2" or "1/3".

BUGS
       We don't perform normalisation of the denominator and numerator so
       "4/6" is not converted like "2/3" is.  This is intentional.

       2.25 doesn't render to the same thing as "2 1/2" (the latter has a
       space between the digit 2 and the fraction.)

       "1/7" doesn't represent as a reoccuring pattern of digits in decimal
       therefore we don't check that digits after 0.14285714 are correct, and
       assume that they are.
