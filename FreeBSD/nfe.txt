NFE(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 NFE(4)

NAME
     nfe – NVIDIA nForce MCP Ethernet driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device miibus
           device nfe

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_nfe_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The nfe driver supports PCI Ethernet adapters based on the NVIDIA nForce
     Media and Communications Processors (MCP), such as the nForce, nForce 2,
     nForce 3, CK804, MCP04, MCP51, MCP55, MCP61, MCP65, MCP67, MCP73, MCP77
     and MCP79 Ethernet controller chips.

     Supported features include (hardware support provided):

     •   Receive/Transmit IP/TCP/UDP checksum offload
     •   Hardware VLAN tag insertion/stripping
     •   TCP segmentation offload (TSO)
     •   MSI/MSI-X
     •   Jumbo Frames

     Support for Jumbo Frames is provided via the interface MTU setting.
     Selecting an MTU larger than 1500 bytes with the ifconfig(8) utility
     configures the adapter to receive and transmit Jumbo Frames.

     The nfe driver supports the following media types:

     autoselect   Enable autoselection of the media type and options.

     10baseT/UTP  Set 10Mbps operation.

     100baseTX    Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.

     1000baseT    Set 1000Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) operation (recent models
                  only).

     The nfe driver supports the following media options:

     half-duplex      Force half duplex operation.

     full-duplex      Force full duplex operation.

     For more information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

     •   NVIDIA nForce4 CK804 MCP9 Networking Adapter

LOADER TUNABLES
     Tunables can be set at the loader(8) prompt before booting the kernel or
     stored in loader.conf(5).

     hw.nfe.msi_disable
             Whether or not MSI support is enabled in the driver.  The default
             value is 0.

     hw.nfe.msix_disable
             Whether or not MSI-X support is enabled in the driver.  The
             default value is 0.

SYSCTL VARIABLES
     The following sysctl(8) variables can be used to modify or monitor nfe
     behavior.

     dev.nfe.%d.process_limit
             Maximum number of Rx events to be processed in the event loop
             before rescheduling a taskqueue.  The accepted range is 50 to
             255, the default value is 192.  The interface does not need to be
             brought down and up again before a change takes effect.

HISTORY
     The nfe device driver first appeared in OpenBSD 3.9, and then in
     FreeBSD 7.0.

AUTHORS
     The nfe driver was written by Jonathan Gray <jsg@openbsd.org> and Damien
     Bergamini <damien@openbsd.org>.  The nfe driver was ported to FreeBSD by
     Shigeaki Tagashira <shigeaki@se.hiroshima-u.ac.jp>.
