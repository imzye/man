NAME
       freeguide - display TV listings

SYNOPSIS
       freeguide [--dump_prefs]

DESCRIPTION
       Display TV listings.  Run the program with no arguments to launch the
       main window.  Open the "Help" menu and choose "User Guide" for more
       information.

OPTIONS
       --dump_prefs
              Write out the entire set of preferences FreeGuide is using, and
              exit.  The preferences are written to the current directory into
              a file called prefs_cur-VERSION.txt where VERSION is the current
              version of FreeGuide.  Additionally, if a migration is needed to
              update FreeGuide's preferences, several more files are written,
              with names like prefs_old-VERSION.txt and prefs_new-VERSION.txt.
              These reflect the preferences stored before and after each stage
              of the migration process.
