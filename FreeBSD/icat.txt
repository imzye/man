NAME
       icat - display images in terminal

SYNOPSIS
       icat [OPTION]... FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       icat outputs images on 256-color terminals with UTF-8 locale.  It can
       also display images in 24-bit color mode, for terminals which support
       it.

       You can specify multiple images to be displayed.  If you use "-" as the
       filename, the image will be read from standard input.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Display a help screen and exit.

       -k, --keep
              Do not automatically resize larger images to fit in terminal
              width.  Using this overrides the --width option.

       -m, --mode <indexed, 24bit, both>
              Use indexed mode (256-color, the default), 24-bit color, or
              both.

       -w, --width COLUMNS
              Specifies how many terminal columns to use (controls width of
              output).

       -x COLUMN
              Specifies the column to output the image at (indexed starting
              from 1).

       -y ROW Specifies the row to output the image at (indexed starting from
              1).  Ignored if more than one file is provided.
