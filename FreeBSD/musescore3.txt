DESCRIPTION
     MuseScore is a Free and Open Source WYSIWYG cross-platform multi-lingual
     music composition and notation software, released under the GNU General
     Public Licence (GPLv2).

     Running mscore without any extra options launches the full graphical
     MuseScore program and opens any files specified on the command line.

     The options are as follows:

     -a | --use-audio driver
             Use audio driver: one of jack, alsa, portaudio, pulse

     -b | --bitrate bitrate
             Set MP3 output bitrate in kbit/s

     -c | --config-folder pathname
             Override configuration and settings directory

     -D | --monitor-resolution DPI
             Specify monitor resolution (override autodetection)

     -d | --debug
             Start MuseScore in debug mode

     -E | --install-extension extension file
             Install an extension file; soundfonts are loaded by default
             unless -e is also specified

     -e | --experimental
             Enable experimental features, such as layers

     -F | --factory-settings
             Revert all settings, shortcuts, workspaces, extensions,
             translations, etc. to factory defaults; compare with the -R
             option

     -f | --force
             Ignore score corruption and version mismatch warnings in
             “converter mode”

     -h | --help
             Display an overview of invocation instructions

     -I | --dump-midi-in
             Display all MIDI input on the console

     -i | --load-icons
             Load icons from the filesystem; useful if you want to edit the
             MuseScore icons and preview the changes

     -j | --job file.json
             Process a conversion job (see EXAMPLES below)

     -L | --layout-debug
             Start MuseScore in layout debug mode

     -M | --midi-operations file
             Specify MIDI import operations file (see EXAMPLES below)

     -m | --no-midi
             Disable MIDI input

     -n | --new-score
             Start with the New Score wizard regardless whether it's enabled
             or disabled in the user preferences

     -O | --dump-midi-out
             Display all MIDI output on the console

     -o | --export-to file
             Export the given (or currently opened) file to the specified
             output file.  The file type depends on the extension of the
             filename given.  This option switches to “converter mode” and
             avoids the graphical user interface.

     -P | --export-score-parts
             When converting to PDF with the -o option, append each part's
             pages to the created PDF file.  If the score has no parts, all
             default parts will temporarily be generated automatically.

     -p | --plugin name
             Execute the named plugin

     -R | --revert-settings
             Revert user preferences to factory default but retain shortcuts,
             workspaces, extensions, translations, etc.; compare with -F.

     -r | --image-resolution DPI
             Set image resolution for conversion to PNG files.

             Default: 360 DPI (actually, the value of “Resolution” of the PNG
             option group in the Export tab of the preferences)

     -S | --style style
             Load a style file first; useful for use with the -o option

     -s | --no-synthesizer
             Disable the integrated software synthesiser

     -T | --trim-image margin
             Trim exported PNG and SVG images to remove whitespace surrounding
             the score.  The specified margin, in pixels, will be retained
             (use 0 for a tightly cropped image).  When exporting to SVG, this
             option only works with single-page scores.

     -t | --test-mode
             Set test mode flag for all files

     -v | --version
             Display the name and version of the application without starting
             the graphical user interface

     -w | --no-webview
             Disable the web view component in the Start Centre

     -x | --gui-scaling factor
             Scale the score display and other GUI elements by the specified
             factor; intended for use with high-resolution displays

     --diff  Print a conditioned diff between the given scores

     --long-version
             Display the full name, version and git revision of the
             application without starting the graphical user interface

     --no-fallback-font
             Don't use a fallback musical font

     --raw-diff
             Print a raw diff between the given scores

     --run-test-script
             Run script tests listed in the command line arguments

     --save-online
             Upload score(s) to its source URL. There must already be an
             online score at that URL, and the user must be signed-in to the
             account it belongs to. The online score will be replaced with the
             uploaded file, but the title and description of the online
             score's webpage will not change.

     --score-media
             Export all media (except MP3) for a given score as a single JSON
             document to stdout

     --highlight-config
             Set highlight to svg, generated from a given score

     --score-mp3
             Generate an MP3 for the given score and export it as a single
             JSON document to stdout

     --score-parts
             Generate parts data for the given score and save them to separate
             mscz files

     --score-parts-pdf
             Generate parts data for the given score and export it as a single
             JSON document to stdout

     --score-transpose
             Transpose the given score and export the data to a single JSON
             file, print it to stdout

     --source-update
             Update the source in the given score

     --template-mode
             Save files in template mode (e.g. without page sizes)

     MuseScore supports the automatic Qt command line options (see below).

   Batch conversion job JSON format
     The argument to the -j option must be the pathname of a file comprised of
     a valid JSON document honouring the following specification:

     •   The top-level element must be a JSONArray, which may be empty.

     •   Each array element must be a JSONObject with the following keys:

         in      Value is the name of the input file (score to convert), as
                 JSONString.

         plugin  Value is the filename of a plugin (with the .qml extension),
                 which will be read from either the global or per-user plugin
                 path and executed before the conversion output happens, as
                 JSONString.  Optional, but at least one of plugin and out
                 must be given.

         out     Value is the conversion output target, as defined below.
                 Optional, but at least one of plugin and out must be given.

     •   The conversion output target may be a filename (with extension, which
         decided the format to convert to), as JSONString.

     •   The conversion output target may be a JSONArray of filenames as
         JSONString, as above, which will cause the score to be written to
         multiple output files (in multiple output formats) sequentially,
         without being closed, re-opened and re-processed in between.

     •   If the conversion output target is a JSONArray, one or more of its
         elements may also be, each, a JSONArray of two JSONStrings (called
         first and second half in the following description).  This will cause
         part extraction: for each such two-tuple, all extant parts of the
         score will be saved individually, with filenames being composed by
         concatenating the first half, the name (title) of the part, and the
         second half.  The resulting string must be a valid filename (with
         extension, determining the output format).  If a score has no parts
         (excerpts) defined, this will be silently ignored without error.

     •   Valid file extensions for output are:

         flac      Free Lossless Audio Codec (compressed audio)

         metajson  various score metadata (JSON)

         mid       standard MIDI file

         midi      standard MIDI file

         mlog      internal file sanity check log (JSON)

         mp3       MPEG Layer III (lossy compressed audio)

         mpos      measure positions (XML)

         mscx      uncompressed MuseScore file

         mscz      compressed MuseScore file

         musicxml  uncompressed MusicXML file

         mxl       compressed MusicXML file

         ogg       OGG Vorbis (lossy compressed audio)

         pdf       portable document file (print)

         png       portable network graphics (image)

                   Individual files, one per score page, with a hyphen-minus
                   followed by the page number placed before the file
                   extension, will be generated.

         spos      segment positions (XML)

         svg       scalable vector graphics (image)

         wav       RIFF Waveform (uncompressed audio)

         xml       uncompressed MusicXML file

     See below for an example.

ENVIRONMENT
     SKIP_LIBJACK
             Set this (the value does not matter) to skip initialisation of
             the JACK Audio Connection Kit library, in case it causes trouble.

     XDG_CONFIG_HOME
             User configuration location; defaults to ~/.config if unset.

     XDG_DATA_HOME
             User data location; defaults to ~/.local/share if unset.

     XDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR
             Location of works the user created with the application; defaults
             to ~/Documents (or a localised version) and can be set in
             $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/user-dirs.dirs.

     Note that MuseScore also supports the normal Qt environment variables
     such as QT_QPA_GENERIC_PLUGINS, QT_QPA_PLATFORM, QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME,
     QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH, QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE, DISPLAY, etc.

FILES
     /usr/local/share/mscore-3.6/ contains the application support data
     (demos, instruments, localisation, system-wide plugins, soundfonts,
     styles, chords, templates and wallpapers).  In the Debian packages,
     system-wide soundfonts are installed into /usr/share/sounds/sf2/,
     /usr/share/sounds/sf3/ or /usr/share/sounds/sfz/, respectively, instead.

     The per-user data (extensions, plugins, soundfonts, styles, templates)
     and files (images, scores) are normally installed into subdirectories
     under $XDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR/MuseScore3/ but may be changed in the
     configuration.  Note that snapshot, alpha and beta versions use
     MuseScore3Development instead of MuseScore3 in all of these paths.

     $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/MuseScore/MuseScore3.ini contains the user preferences,
     list of recently used files and their locations, window sizes and
     positions, etc.  See above for development version paths.

     $XDG_DATA_HOME/MuseScore/MuseScore3/ contains updated localisation files
     downloaded from within the program, plugin information, cached scores,
     credentials for the musescore.com community site, session information,
     synthesiser settings, custom key and time signatures and shortcuts.  See
     above for development version paths.

EXAMPLES
     Convert a score to PDF from the command line:

           mscore -o 'My Score.pdf' 'My Score.mscz'

     Run a batch job converting multiple documents:

           mscore -j job.json

     This requires the file job.json in the current working directory to have
     content similar to the following:

           [
             {
               "in": "Reunion.mscz",
               "out": "Reunion-coloured.pdf",
               "plugin": "colornotes.qml"
             },
             {
               "in": "Reunion.mscz",
               "out": [
                 "Reunion.pdf",
                 [ "Reunion (part for ", ").pdf" ],
                 "Reunion.musicxml",
                 "Reunion.mid"
               ]
             },
             {
               "in": "Piece with excerpts.mscz",
               "out": [
                 "Piece with excerpts (Partitura).pdf",
                 [ "Piece with excerpts (part for ", ").pdf" ],
                 "Piece with excerpts.mid"
               ]
             }
           ]

     The last part of the job would, for example, cause files like “Piece with
     excerpts (part for Violin).pdf” to be generated alongside the conductor's
     partitura and a MIDI file with the full orchestra sound, whereas the
     equivalent part of the Reunion conversion will be silently ignored
     (because the Reunion piece (a MuseScore demo) has no excerpts defined).

     https://musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/midi_import_options_0.xml
     is a sample MIDI import operations file for the -M option.

DIAGNOSTICS
     The mscore utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

STANDARDS
     MuseScore attempts to implement the following standards:

     •   MusicXML 3.1 (score interchange format)

     •   SF2 (SoundFont 2.01)

     •   SF3 (SoundFont with OGG Vorbis-compressed samples)

     •   SFZ (Sforzato soundfont)

     •   SMuFL (Standard Music Font Layout 1.30)

HISTORY
     MuseScore was split off the MusE sequencer in 2002 and has since become
     the foremost Open Source notation software.

AUTHORS
     MuseScore is developed by MuseScore BVBA and others.

     This manual page was written by mirabilos ⟨tg@debian.org⟩.

CAVEATS
     The automatic Qt command line options are removed from the argument
     vector before the application has a chance at option processing; this
     means that an invocation like

           mscore -S -reverse

     has no chance at working because the -reverse is removed by Qt first.

BUGS
     MuseScore does not honour /etc/papersize.

     Probably some more; check the project's bug tracker (cf. SEE ALSO).
