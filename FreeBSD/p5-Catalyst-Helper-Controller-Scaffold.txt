Catalyst::Helper::Controller::Scaffold(3)  User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Catalyst::Helper::Controller::Scaffold - Helper for Scaffolding

SYNOPSIS
           # Imagine you want to generate a scaffolding controller MyApp::C::SomeTable
           # for a CDBI table class MyApp::M::CDBI::SomeTable
           script/myapp_create.pl controller SomeTable Scaffold CDBI::SomeTable

DESCRIPTION
       Helper for Scaffolding.

       Templates are TT so you'll need a TT View Component and a forward in
       your end action too. This can be accomplished with
       Catalyst::Plugin::DefaultEnd.

       Note that you have to add these lines to your CDBI class...

           use Class::DBI::AsForm;
           use Class::DBI::FromForm;

       for Catalyst::Model::CDBI you can do that  by adding this

           additional_base_classes => [qw/Class::DBI::AsForm Class::DBI::FromForm/],

       to the component config. Also, change your application class like this:

           use Catalyst qw/-Debug FormValidator/;

       Also, note that the scaffolding uses Template::Plugin::Class, so it
       will be a requirement for you application as well.

METHODS
