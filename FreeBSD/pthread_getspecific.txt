PTHREAD_GETSPECIFIC(3)                        FreeBSD Library Functions Manual

NAME
     pthread_getspecific – get a thread-specific data value

LIBRARY
     POSIX Threads Library (libpthread, -lpthread)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <pthread.h>

     void *
     pthread_getspecific(pthread_key_t key);

DESCRIPTION
     The pthread_getspecific() function returns the value currently bound to
     the specified key on behalf of the calling thread.

     The effect of calling pthread_getspecific() with a key value not obtained
     from pthread_key_create() or after key has been deleted with
     pthread_key_delete() is undefined.

     The pthread_getspecific() function may be called from a thread-specific
     data destructor function.  A call to pthread_getspecific() for the
     thread-specific data key being destroyed returns the value NULL, unless
     the value is changed (after the destructor starts) by a call to
     pthread_setspecific().

RETURN VALUES
     The pthread_getspecific() function will return the thread-specific data
     value associated with the given key.  If no thread-specific data value is
     associated with key, then the value NULL is returned.

ERRORS
     None.

STANDARDS
     The pthread_getspecific() function conforms to ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996
     (“POSIX.1”).
