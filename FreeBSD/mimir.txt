NAME
       dcg - datastructure generator.

SYNOPSYS
       dcg [many options possible] filename

WARNING
       The information in the man page is an extract from the full
       documentation of the dcg datastructure generator. As dcg tends to
       evolve over time, this man page might not always be up to date.

DESCRIPTION
       dcg generates a C header and source file from a dcg data structure
       description for subsequent compilation by a C compiler.

OPTIONS
       Options must be separated: `-xn' is different from `-x -n'.  The
       following options are specific for dcg.

       -h     provides help on using dcg.

       -V     gives version of dcg.

       -n     forces dcg not to code i.e. the source files are only checked
              for validity.

       -v     gives extra information while dcg is generating.

       -fv    gives lots of extra information while dcg is generating.

       -Idir  adds dir to the search path (i.e. the list of directories to
              search for dcg def files).
