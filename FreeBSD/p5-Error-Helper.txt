SYNOPSIS
       Below is a example script showing it's usage.

           use warnings;
           use strict;

           {
               package Foo;
               use base 'Error::Helper';

       There are five required variables in the blessed hash object.

           - $self->{error} :: This contains the current error code.
               - Type :: int or undef

           - $self->{errorFilename} :: File from which $self->warn was called.
               - Type :: string or undef

           - $self->{errorLine} :: Line from which $self->warn was called.
               - Type :: int or undef

           - $self->{errorString} :: This contains a description of the current error.
               - Type :: string or undef

           - $self->{perror} :: This is set to true is a permanent error is present.
                   If note, it needs set to false.
               - Type :: Perl boolean

       The following are optional.

           - $self->{errorExtra} :: This is a hash reserved for any additional Error::Helper items.

           - $self->{errorExtra}{all_errors_fatal} :: If true, this will die when $self->warn is called instead of
                   printing the error to STDERR. This is for if you want to use it eval for capturing errors and this
                   module more for handling grabbing error specifics, such as dieing and additional code based on the
                   return of $self->errorFlag.
               - Type :: Perl boolean
               - Default :: undef

           - $self->{errorExtra}{fatal_errors} :: This is a hash in which the keys are errors codes that are fatal. When
                   $self->warn is called it will check if the error code is fatal or not. $self->{errorExtra}{fatal_errors}{33}=>1
                   would be fatal, but $self->{errorExtra}{fatal_errors}{33}=>0 would now.

           - $self->{errorExtra}{flags} :: This hash contains error integer to flag mapping. The
                   keys are the error integer and the value is the flag. For any unmatched error
                   integers, 'other' is returned.

           - $self->{errorExtra}{fatal_flags} :: This is a hash in which the keys are error flags that are fatal. When
                   $self->warn is called it will check if the flag for the error code is fatal or not. For the flag foo
                   $self->{errorExtra}{fatal_flags}{foo}=>1 would be fatal, but
                   $self->{errorExtra}{fatal_flags}{foo}=>0 would now.

           - $self->{errorExtra}{perror_not_fatal} :: Controls if $self->{perror} is fatal or not.
               - Type :: Perl boolean
               - Default :: undef

       This module also sets several other variables as well for when
       something like a new method is called and dies, before something
       blessed can be returned. These allow examining the the error that
       resulted in it dieing.

       The following are mapped to the the ones above.

           $Error::Helper::perror
           $Error::Helper::error
           $Error::Helper::errorString
           $Error::Helper::errorFlag
           $Error::Helper::errorFilename
           $Error::Helper::errorLine

       The following don't have mappings above.

           - $Error::Helper::errorSub :: The sub that warn was called from.

           - $Error::Helper::errorSubShort :: Same as errorSub, but everything prior to the subname is
                   removed. So Foo::bar would become bar.

           - $Error::Helper::errorPackage :: The package from which warn was called from.

           - $Error::Helper::errorPackageShort :: Saome as package, but everthing prior to the last item
                   in the name space is removed. So Foo::Foo::Bar would just become Bar.

METHODS
   error
       Returns the current error code and true if there is an error.

       If there is no error, undef is returned.

           if($self->error){
               # do something
           }

   errorblank
       This blanks the error storage and is only meant for internal usage.

       It does the following.

               $self->{error}         = undef;
               $self->{errorFilename} = undef;
               $self->{errorLine}     = undef;
               $self->{errorString}   = "";

       If $self->{perror} is set, it will not be able to blank any current
       errors.

   errorFilename
       This returns the filename in which the error occured or other wise
       returns undef.

           if($self->error){
               print 'error happened in '.$self->errorFilename."\n";
           }

   errorFlag
       This returns the error flag for the current error.

       If none is set, undef is returned.

       This may be used in a similar manner as the error method.

           if ( $self->errorFlag ){
               if ( $self->errorFlag eq 'foo' ){
                   # do something
               }else{
                   die('error flag '.$self->errorFlag.' can not be handled');
               }
           }

   errorLine
       This returns the filename in which the error occured or other wise
       returns undef.

           if($self->error){
               print 'error happened at line '.$self->errorLine."\n";
           }

   errorString
       Returns the error string if there is one. If there is not, it will
       return ''.

           if($self->error){
               warn('error: '.$self->error.":".$self->errorString);
           }

   perror
       This returns a Perl boolean for if there is a permanent error or not.

           if($self->perror){
                       warn('A permanent error is set');
           }

   warn
       Throws a warn like error message based using the contents of
       $self->errorString

           $self->warn;

   warnString
       Throws a warn like error in the same for mate as warn, but with a
       freeform message.

       This will not trigger any of the fatality checks. It will also not set
       any of the error values.

           $self->warnString('some error');

ERROR FLAGS
       Error flags are meant to be short non-spaced strings that are easier to
       remember than a specific error integer.

       'other' is the generic error flag for when one is not defined.

       An error flag should never evaluate to false if an error is present.
