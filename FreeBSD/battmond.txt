BATTMOND(1)             FreeBSD General Commands Manual            BATTMOND(1)

NAME
     battmond – monitor battery level on ACPI-enabled (laptop) computers

SYNOPSIS
     battmond [-d device] [-i interval] [-W warning] [-H halt] [-z] [-h]

DESCRIPTION
     battmond monitors the battery level on your ACPI-enabled (laptop)
     computer.  Battmond probes your battery level in predefined intervals.
     When the battery level is running low it writes a warning message to the
     syslog.  On critical level, it powers the computer down. Both levels and
     the probe interval can be configured on the command line.

     battmond probes the battery level through the ACPIIO_BATT_GET_BATTINFO
     ioctl(2) on /dev/acpi.  -d option allows for defining a different device,
     although you shouldn't (probably) need it. Probes are performed in
     regular intervals of 10 seconds. This value can be tweaked through the -i
     option. When the computer is on battery (i.e. there is a battery present
     and no power cord is connected), battmond checks the battery level
     against two values: the warning and the halt threshold. If the battery
     level goes below the former, a warning is sent to the syslog with a
     priority of LOG_ALERT. If it goes below the latter, battmond initiates a
     system shutdown, through a call to /sbin/halt. The warning and halt
     thresholds can be tuned using the -W and -H options respectively. Values
     are expressed in percentage of maximum charge, with default values being
     10 (%) for the warning message and 5 (%) for the system halt. Using the
     -z option will switch the behaviour of the program to suspend the
     computer instead of shutting it down. Finally, -h prints a brief help
     message to the stderr and terminates the program.
