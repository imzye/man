DESCRIPTION
     The atse device driver provides support for the Altera Triple-Speed
     Ethernet MegaCore.

HARDWARE
     The current version of the atse driver supports the Ethernet MegaCore as
     described in version 11.1 of Altera's documentation when the device is
     configured with internal FIFOs.

MAC SELECTION
     The default MAC address for each atse interface is derived from a value
     stored in cfi(4) flash.  The value is managed by the atsectl(8) utility.

     Only a single MAC address may be stored in flash.  If the address begins
     with the Altera prefix 00:07:ed and ends in 00 then up to 16 addresses
     will be derived from it by adding the unit number of the interface to the
     stored address.  For other prefixes, the address will be assigned to
     atse0 and random addresses will be used for other interfaces.  If the
     stored address is invalid, for example all zero's, multicast, or the
     default address shipped on all DE4 boards (00:07:ed:ff:ed:15) then a
     random address is generated when the device is attached.

HISTORY
     The atse device driver first appeared in FreeBSD 10.0.

AUTHORS
     The atse device driver and this manual page were developed by SRI
     International and the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory under
     DARPA/AFRL contract (FA8750-10-C-0237) (“CTSRD”), as part of the DARPA
     CRASH research programme.  This device driver was written by Bjoern A.
     Zeeb.

BUGS
     The atse driver only supports a single configuration of the MegaCore as
     installed on the Terasic Technologies Altera DE4 Development and
     Education Board.

     Only gigabit Ethernet speeds are currently supported.
