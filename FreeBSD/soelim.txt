SOELIM(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              SOELIM(1)

NAME
     soelim – interpret .so requests in manpages

SYNOPSIS
     soelim [-Crtv] [-I dir] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The soelim utility reads the specified files or the standard input and
     performs the textual inclusion implied by the nroff(1) directives of the
     form:

           .so anotherfile

     If a line starts with: “.so anotherfile” it replaces the line by
     processing “anotherfile”.  Otherwise the line is printed to stdout.

     -C      Recognise .so when it is not followed by a space character.

     -r      Compatibility with groff's soelim(1) (does nothing).

     -t      Compatibility with groff's soelim(1) (does nothing).

     -v      Compatibility with groff's soelim(1) (does nothing).

     -I dir  This option specifies directories where soelim searches for files
             (both those on the command line and those named in “.so”
             directive.)  This option may be specified multiple times.  The
             directories will be searched in the order specified.

     The files are always searched first in the current directory.

     A file specified with an absolute path will be opened directly without
     performing a search.
