c2t(1)                  FreeBSD General Commands Manual                 c2t(1)

Name
       c2t - translates GB/Big5 encoding to tone pinyin et al (chinese)

Syntax
       c2t [-D dictionary] [-k|c file_name] [-m]

Description
       Translates from stdin chinese characters to stdout by default in
       pinyin.

       Programmed by Tommi Kaikkonen (tommi@phoenix.oulu.fi) in 1992.
       Improved by Katya Ta (ta_k@maths.su.oz.au).


       -D dictionary
              Seems to work fine for gb & big5 dictionaries with the
              corresponding input.  Default:
              /usr/sbin/lib/cxterm/dicts/TONEPY.tit

       -k     Keep - keep any characters not found ie. print them to stdio.
              Default: displays ???

       -c file_name
              Character file of not found characters; not with -k!

       -m     Multisearch - displays all possible matches of characters
              instead of just the first match.


Examples
       hz2gb < hzfile | c2t | cless

       c2t < gbfile > pinyinfile

Files
       Used as translation dictionnary. Configured in c2t.c DICT string.
                      Other dictionaries can be used instead of the default
                      one with the command line switch -D
                      dictionary_file_name.
