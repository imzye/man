NAME
     lmmon – display motherboard power management controller information

SYNOPSIS
     lmmon [-hipsv] [-r delay]

DESCRIPTION
     lmmon lmmon is a console application to display information associated
     with information received from a motherboard power management controller.
     By default it cycles once every second using a curses-based display.

     The following options are available:

     -h      Display help.

     -i      Use /dev/io interface instead of /dev/smb0.  Required for FreeBSD
             3.x (prior to 01 November 1999) and some motherboards without
             actual LM78/79 chipsets.

     -m      Simple output format, suitable for further processing.  Forces -p
             and -s.

     -p      Plain display (no curses).

     -r delay
             Redisplay every delay seconds (default 1).

     -s      Single-shot mode (run once).

     -v      Display version information.

     The following kernel configuration options are required to use the
     /dev/smb0 interface:

           controller      smbus0
           controller      iicbus0
           controller      iicbb0
           controller      intpm0
           device          smb0    at smbus?

BUGS
     Currently, the intpm(4) controller is only available in FreeBSD 4.0 and
     3.3-STABLE after 01 November 1999; however, the /dev/io interface may
     work on older versions and a wider variety of motherboards.
