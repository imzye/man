NAME
     snmp_vacm – View-based Access Control module for bsnmpd(1)

LIBRARY
     (begemotSnmpdModulePath."vacm" = /usr/lib/snmp_vacm.so)

DESCRIPTION
     The snmp_vacm module implements SNMPv3 View-based Access Control Model
     MIB as defined in RFC 3415. The module is used to manage the internal
     lists of SNMPv1, v2c and v3 user names and groups and their access rights
     to fetch or modify the values of the MIB objects maintained by bsnmpd and
     the modules loaded in the daemon.  The module must be loaded for bsnmpd
     to implement proper view-based access control. If the module is not
     loaded, access is granted to all configured SNMPv1 & SNMPv2c communities
     and SNMPv3 USM users.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
     An entry in any table implemented by this MIB may be created by setting
     the relevant RowStatus column to createAndGo (4) - in fact, any other
     value for those columns in a SET operation will cause an error. When an
     entry is created, any of its columns that is not used as index, is set to
     the default value as specified in the SNMP-VIEW-BASED-ACM-MIB. All
     entries maintained by the module are persistent after reboot if created
     via bsnmpd 's config file, otherwise entries created via SNMP are lost
     after reboot.  A short description of the objects in the MIB follows.

     vacmContextTable
                A read-only table that consists of a list of SNMP contexts
                available in bsnmpd.

     vacmSecurityToGroupTable
                The table contains a list of SNMPv1, v2c and v3 user names and
                the groups they belong to.

     vacmAccessTable
                The table contains a list of SNMP contexts to groups mappings
                and respectively the names of the SNMP views under those
                contexts, to which users in the group are granted read-only,
                read-write access or receive notifications for the objects
                under the subtree in the relevant view.

     vacmViewTreeFamilyTable
                The table contains a list of SNMP views, i.e. entries
                specifying the OID of a MIB subtree and whether access to the
                objects under this subtree is to be allowed or forbidden.
