GSS_WRAP(3)         FreeBSD Library Functions Manual (prm)         GSS_WRAP(3)

NAME
     gss_wrap, gss_seal – Attach a cryptographic MIC and optionally encrypt a
     message

SYNOPSIS
     #include <gssapi/gssapi.h>

     OM_uint32
     gss_wrap(OM_uint32 *minor_status, const gss_ctx_id_t context_handle,
         int conf_req_flag, gss_qop_t qop_req,
         const gss_buffer_t input_message_buffer, int *conf_state,
         gss_buffer_t output_message_buffer);

     OM_uint32
     gss_seal(OM_uint32 *minor_status, gss_ctx_id_t context_handle,
         int conf_req_flag, gss_qop_t qop_req,
         gss_buffer_t input_message_buffer, int *conf_state,
         gss_buffer_t output_message_buffer);

DESCRIPTION
     Attaches a cryptographic MIC and optionally encrypts the specified
     input_message.  The output_message contains both the MIC and the message.
     The qop_req parameter allows a choice between several cryptographic
     algorithms, if supported by the chosen mechanism.

     Since some application-level protocols may wish to use tokens emitted by
     gss_wrap() to provide "secure framing", implementations must support the
     wrapping of zero-length messages.

     The gss_seal() routine is an obsolete variant of gss_wrap().  It is
     provided for backwards compatibility with applications using the GSS-API
     V1 interface.  A distinct entrypoint (as opposed to #define) is provided,
     both to allow GSS-API V1 applications to link and to retain the slight
     parameter type differences between the obsolete versions of this routine
     and its current form.

PARAMETERS
     minor_status               Mechanism specific status code.

     context_handle             Identifies the context on which the message
                                will be sent.

     conf_req_flag
                                Non-zero  Both confidentiality and integrity
                                          services are requested.
                                Zero      Only integrity service is requested.

     qop_req                    Specifies required quality of protection.  A
                                mechanism-specific default may be requested by
                                setting qop_req to GSS_C_QOP_DEFAULT.  If an
                                unsupported protection strength is requested,
                                gss_wrap() will return a major_status of
                                GSS_S_BAD_QOP.

     input_message_buffer       Message to be protected.

     conf_state
                                Non-zero  Confidentiality, data origin
                                          authentication and integrity
                                          services have been applied.
                                Zero      Integrity and data origin services
                                          only has been applied.

     output_message_buffer      Buffer to receive protected message.  Storage
                                associated with this buffer must be freed by
                                the application after use with a call to
                                gss_release_buffer(3).

RETURN VALUES
     GSS_S_COMPLETE             Successful completion.

     GSS_S_CONTEXT_EXPIRED      The context has already expired

     GSS_S_NO_CONTEXT           The context_handle parameter did not identify
                                a valid context.

     GSS_S_BAD_QOP              The specified QOP is not supported by the
                                mechanism.
