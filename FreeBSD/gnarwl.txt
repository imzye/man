?[1mNAME?[0m
       damnit - DAtabase MaNagement InTerface


?[1mSYNOPSIS?[0m
       ?[1mdamnit   ?[22m[-h]   [-d <file> <value>]  [-a <file> <value>]  [-f
<string>]
       [-l <file>]


?[1mDESCRIPTION?[0m
       ?[1mdamnit ?[22mis the database management tool for ?[1mgnarwl(8)
?[22msystemadministra-
       tors  to  list and/or manipulate ?[1mgnarwl's ?[22mdatabase files. It
is not in-
       tented to be employed by the average user, who should use LDAP  as  the
       only interface to ?[1mgnarwl(8)?[0m


?[1mOPTIONS?[0m
       -h     Print usage information


       -f <string>
              Select  output format for database listing (only meaningful with
              -l).  <string> is the template for what the output  should  look
              like.  The  following  macros  are  recognized:  %entry,  %time,
              %tstamp, \n and \t. Translating to the entry itself,  the  en-
              trytime  (in human readable form), the entrytime (as timestamp),
              a newline character, and a tab character.   The  default  format
              is: "%time -> %entry\n". Don't forget the trailing newline.


       -d <file> [<value>]
              Delete  <value>  from  <file>. If <value> is omited, damnit will
              read <value> from stdin (one per line), until either EOF  or  an
              empty line is detected.


       -a <file> [<value>]
              Add  <value>  to <file>. If <value> is already stored in <file>,
              damnit will only update the timestamp.  If  <value>  is  omited,
              damnit will read <value> from stdin (one per line), until either
              EOF or an emtpy line is detected.


       -l <file>
              List database file specified by <file>.


?[1mDATABASE FILES?[0m
       ?[1mgnarwl  ?[22muses  hashfiles  for  storing information on disk.
Meaning, all
       datasets consist of key and value pairs. The key is always a NULL  ter-
       minated  character string, while the value contains the timestamp, when
       the key was entered (last time) into the file.  This  timestamp  is  of
       type  time_t  (as returned by time(2)) and therefore, ?[1mgnarwl's
?[22mdatabase
       files are not copyable between different system architectures.

              Every file in this directory represents an emailaddress,
?[1mgnarwl?[0m
              (already)  received  a mail for. Every time, gnarwl sends out an
              autorreply for an address, the recepient of that mail is  locked
              into  the  according file.  ?[1mgnarwl ?[22mwill not send any
further au-
              toreplies for this  sender/receiver  combo,  until  the  timeout
              specified in gnarwl.cfg expires.

       ?[4m/usr/local/var/lib/gnarwl/blacklist.db?[0m
              Emailaddresses  listed  as  keys in this file are not subject to
              autoresponding (the addresses of root, postmaster, webmaster and
              the like should be put herin). Note: The  complete  mailaddress,
              as  it  would  appear  in  an  email, must be specified here, as
              ?[1mgnarwl ?[22mchecks these "as-is".

       ?[4m/usr/local/var/lib/gnarwl/badheaders.db?[0m
              Each entry in this file represent a line that may not  occur  in
              the  header  of a received email. That is, ?[1mgnarwl ?[22mwon't
reply to
              any mail, it is able to match a headerline with an entry in this
              file.
