WMT(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 WMT(4)

NAME
     wmt – MS Windows 7/8/10 - compatible USB HID multi-touch device driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines into
     your kernel configuration file:

           device wmt
           device usb
           device hid
           device evdev

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           wmt_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The wmt driver provides support for the MS Windows 7/8/10 - compatible
     USB HID multi-touch devices found in many laptops.

     To get multi-touch device working in X(7), install
     ports/x11-drivers/xf86-input-evdev.

FILES
     wmt creates a pseudo-device file, /dev/input/eventX which presents the
     multi-touch device as an input event device.

SEE ALSO
     usb(4), loader.conf(5), xorg.conf(5) (ports/x11/xorg), evdev(4)
     (ports/x11-drivers/xf86-input-evdev).

AUTHORS
     The wmt driver was written by Vladimir Kondratyev <wulf@FreeBSD.org>.

BUGS
     wmt cannot act like sysmouse(4), as sysmouse(4) does not support absolute
     motion events.
