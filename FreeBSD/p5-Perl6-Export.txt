NAME
       Perl6::Export - Implements the Perl 6 'is export(...)' trait

SYNOPSIS
               # Perl 5 code...

               package Some::Module;
           use Perl6::Export;

               # Export &foo by default, when explicitly requested,
               # or when the ':ALL' export set is requested...

               sub foo is export(:DEFAULT) {
                       print "phooo!";
               }


               # Export &var by default, when explicitly requested,
               # or when the ':bees', ':pubs', or ':ALL' export set is requested...
               # the parens after 'is export' are like the parens of a qw(...)

               sub bar is export(:DEFAULT :bees :pubs) {
                       print "baaa!";
               }


               # Export &baz when explicitly requested
               # or when the ':bees' or ':ALL' export set is requested...

               sub baz is export(:bees) {
                       print "baassss!";
               }


               # Always export &qux
               # (no matter what else is explicitly or implicitly requested)

               sub qux is export(:MANDATORY) {
                       print "quuuuuuuuux!";
               }


               sub import {
                       # This subroutine is called when the module is used (as usual),
                       # but it is called after any export requests have been handled.
                       # Those requests will have been stripped from its argument list
               }

DESCRIPTION
       Implements what I hope the Perl 6 symbol export mechanism might look
       like.

       It's very straightforward:

       •   If you want a subroutine to be capable of being exported (when
           explicitly requested in the "use" arguments), you mark it with the
           "is export" trait.

       •   If you want a subroutine to be automatically exported when the
           module is used (without specific overriding arguments), you mark it
           with the "is export(:DEFAULT)" trait.

       •   If you want a subroutine to be automatically exported when the
           module is used (even if the user specifies overriding arguments),
           you mark it with the "is export(:MANDATORY)" trait.

       •   If the subroutine should also be exported when particular export
           groups are requested, you add the names of those export groups to
           the trait's argument list.

       That's it.

WARNING
       The syntax and semantics of Perl 6 is still being finalized and
       consequently is at any time subject to change. That means the same
       caveat applies to this module.
