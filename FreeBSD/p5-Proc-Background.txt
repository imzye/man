NAME
       timed-process - Run background process for limited amount of time

SYNOPSIS
           timed-process [-e exit_status] timeout command [<arg> [<arg> ...]]

DESCRIPTION
       This script runs command for a specified amount of time and if it
       doesn't finish, it kills the process.  If command runs and exits before
       the given timeout, timed-process returns the exit value of command.  If
       command did not exit before timeout seconds, then timed-process will
       kill the process and returns an exit value of 255, unless the -e
       command line option is set, which instructs timed-process to return a
       different exit value.  This allows the user of timed-process to
       determine if the process ended normally or was killed.
