DESCRIPTION
       check_postgres.pl is a Perl script that runs many different tests
       against one or more Postgres databases. It uses the psql program to
       gather the information, and outputs the results in one of three
       formats: Nagios, MRTG, or simple.

   Output Modes
       The output can be changed by use of the "--output" option. The default
       output is nagios, although this can be changed at the top of the script
       if you wish. The current option choices are nagios, mrtg, and simple.
       To avoid having to enter the output argument each time, the type of
       output is automatically set if no --output argument is given, and if
       the current directory has one of the output options in its name. For
       example, creating a directory named mrtg and populating it with
       symlinks via the --symlinks argument would ensure that any actions run
       from that directory will always default to an output of "mrtg" As a
       shortcut for --output=simple, you can enter --simple, which also
       overrides the directory naming trick.

       Nagios output

       The default output format is for Nagios, which is a single line of
       information, along with four specific exit codes:

       0 (OK)
       1 (WARNING)
       2 (CRITICAL)
       3 (UNKNOWN)

       The output line is one of the words above, a colon, and then a short
       description of what was measured. Additional statistics information, as
       well as the total time the command took, can be output as well: see the
       documentation on the arguments --showperf, --perflimit, and --showtime.

       MRTG output

       The MRTG output is four lines, with the first line always giving a
       single number of importance.  When possible, this number represents an
       actual value such as a number of bytes, but it may also be a 1 or a 0
       for actions that only return "true" or "false", such as
       check_postgres_version.  The second line is an additional stat and is
       only used for some actions. The third line indicates an "uptime" and is
       not used. The fourth line is a description and usually indicates the
       name of the database the stat from the first line was pulled from, but
       may be different depending on the action.

       Some actions accept an optional --mrtg argument to further control the
       output.

       See the documentation on each action for details on the exact MRTG
       output for each one.

       Simple output

       The simple output is simply a truncated version of the MRTG one, and
       simply returns the first number and nothing else. This is very useful
       when you just want to check the state of something, regardless of any
       threshold. You can transform the numeric output by appending KB, MB,
       GB, TB, or EB to the output argument, for example:

         --output=simple,MB

       Cacti output

       The Cacti output consists of one or more items on the same line, with a
       simple name, a colon, and then a number. At the moment, the only action
       with explicit Cacti output is 'dbstats', and using the --output option
       is not needed in this case, as Cacti is the only output for this
       action. For many other actions, using --simple is enough to make Cacti
       happy.

DATABASE CONNECTION OPTIONS
       All actions accept a common set of database options.

       -H NAME or --host=NAME
           Connect to the host indicated by NAME. Can be a comma-separated
           list of names. Multiple host arguments are allowed. If no host is
           given, defaults to the "PGHOST" environment variable or no host at
           all (which indicates using a local Unix socket). You may also use
           "--dbhost".

       -p PORT or --port=PORT
           Connects using the specified PORT number. Can be a comma-separated
           list of port numbers, and multiple port arguments are allowed. If
           no port number is given, defaults to the "PGPORT" environment
           variable. If that is not set, it defaults to 5432. You may also use
           "--dbport"

       -db NAME or --dbname=NAME
           Specifies which database to connect to. Can be a comma-separated
           list of names, and multiple dbname arguments are allowed. If no
           dbname option is provided, defaults to the "PGDATABASE" environment
           variable.  If that is not set, it defaults to 'postgres' if psql is
           version 8 or greater, and 'template1' otherwise.

       -u USERNAME or --dbuser=USERNAME
           The name of the database user to connect as. Can be a comma-
           separated list of usernames, and multiple dbuser arguments are
           allowed. If this is not provided, it defaults to the "PGUSER"
           environment variable, otherwise it defaults to 'postgres'.

       --dbpass=PASSWORD
           Provides the password to connect to the database with. Use of this
           option is highly discouraged.  Instead, one should use a .pgpass or
           pg_service.conf file.

       --dbservice=NAME
           The name of a service inside of the pg_service.conf file. Before
           version 9.0 of Postgres, this is a global file, usually found in
           /etc/pg_service.conf. If you are using version 9.0 or higher of
           Postgres, you can use the file ".pg_service.conf" in the home
           directory of the user running the script, e.g. nagios.

           This file contains a simple list of connection options. You can
           also pass additional information when using this option such as
           --dbservice="maindatabase sslmode=require"

           The documentation for this file can be found at
           <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-pgservice.html>

       --role=ROLE
           Provides the role to switch to after connecting to the database but
           before running the given check.  This provides the ability to have
           superuser privileges assigned to a role without LOGIN access for
           the purposes of audit and other security considerations.  Requires
           a local `psql` version 9.6 or higher.

       The database connection options can be grouped: --host=a,b --host=c
       --port=1234 --port=3344 would connect to a-1234, b-1234, and c-3344.
       Note that once set, an option carries over until it is changed again.

       Examples:

         --host=a,b --port=5433 --db=c
         Connects twice to port 5433, using database c, to hosts a and b: a-5433-c b-5433-c

         --host=a,b --port=5433 --db=c,d
         Connects four times: a-5433-c a-5433-d b-5433-c b-5433-d

         --host=a,b --host=foo --port=1234 --port=5433 --db=e,f
         Connects six times: a-1234-e a-1234-f b-1234-e b-1234-f foo-5433-e foo-5433-f

         --host=a,b --host=x --port=5432,5433 --dbuser=alice --dbuser=bob -db=baz
         Connects three times: a-5432-alice-baz b-5433-alice-baz x-5433-bob-baz

         --dbservice="foo" --port=5433
         Connects using the named service 'foo' in the pg_service.conf file, but overrides the port

OTHER OPTIONS
       Other options include:

       --action=NAME
           States what action we are running. Required unless using a
           symlinked file, in which case the name of the file is used to
           figure out the action.

       --warning=VAL or -w VAL
           Sets the threshold at which a warning alert is fired. The valid
           options for this option depends on the action used.

       --critical=VAL or -c VAL
           Sets the threshold at which a critical alert is fired. The valid
           options for this option depends on the action used.

       -t VAL or --timeout=VAL
           Sets the timeout in seconds after which the script will abort
           whatever it is doing and return an UNKNOWN status. The timeout is
           per Postgres cluster, not for the entire script. The default value
           is 10; the units are always in seconds.

       --assume-standby-mode
           If specified, first the check if server in standby mode will be
           performed (--datadir is required), if so, all checks that require
           SQL queries will be ignored and "Server in standby mode" with OK
           status will be returned instead.

           Example:

               postgres@db$./check_postgres.pl --action=version --warning=8.1 --datadir /var/lib/postgresql/8.3/main/ --assume-standby-mode
               POSTGRES_VERSION OK:  Server in standby mode | time=0.00

       --assume-prod
           If specified, check if server in production mode is performed
           (--datadir is required).  The option is only relevant for
           ("symlink: check_postgres_checkpoint").

           Example:

               postgres@db$./check_postgres.pl --action=checkpoint --datadir /var/lib/postgresql/8.3/main/ --assume-prod
               POSTGRES_CHECKPOINT OK: Last checkpoint was 72 seconds ago | age=72;;300 mode=MASTER

       --assume-async
           If specified, indicates that any replication between servers is
           asynchronous.  The option is only relevant for ("symlink:
           check_postgres_same_schema").

           Example:
               postgres@db$./check_postgres.pl --action=same_schema
           --assume-async --dbhost=star,line

       -h or --help
           Displays a help screen with a summary of all actions and options.

       --man
           Displays the entire manual.

       -V or --version
           Shows the current version.

       -v or --verbose
           Set the verbosity level. Can call more than once to boost the
           level. Setting it to three or higher (in other words, issuing "-v
           -v -v") turns on debugging information for this program which is
           sent to stderr.

       --showperf=VAL
           Determines if we output additional performance data in standard
           Nagios format (at end of string, after a pipe symbol, using
           name=value).  VAL should be 0 or 1. The default is 1. Only takes
           effect if using Nagios output mode.

       --perflimit=i
           Sets a limit as to how many items of interest are reported back
           when using the showperf option. This only has an effect for actions
           that return a large number of items, such as table_size. The
           default is 0, or no limit. Be careful when using this with the
           --include or --exclude options, as those restrictions are done
           after the query has been run, and thus your limit may not include
           the items you want. Only takes effect if using Nagios output mode.

       --showtime=VAL
           Determines if the time taken to run each query is shown in the
           output. VAL should be 0 or 1. The default is 1. No effect unless
           showperf is on.  Only takes effect if using Nagios output mode.

       --test
           Enables test mode. See the "TEST MODE" section below.

       --PGBINDIR=PATH
           Tells the script where to find the psql binaries. Useful if you
           have more than one version of the PostgreSQL executables on your
           system, or if there are not in your path. Note that this option is
           in all uppercase. By default, this option is not allowed. To enable
           it, you must change the $NO_PSQL_OPTION near the top of the script
           to 0. Avoid using this option if you can, and instead use
           environment variable c<PGBINDIR> or hard-coded $PGBINDIR variable,
           also near the top of the script, to set the path to the PostgreSQL
           to use.

       --PSQL=PATH
           (deprecated, this option may be removed in a future release!) Tells
           the script where to find the psql program. Useful if you have more
           than one version of the psql executable on your system, or if there
           is no psql program in your path. Note that this option is in all
           uppercase. By default, this option is not allowed. To enable it,
           you must change the $NO_PSQL_OPTION near the top of the script to
           0. Avoid using this option if you can, and instead hard-code your
           psql location into the $PSQL variable, also near the top of the
           script.

       --symlinks
           Creates symlinks to the main program for each action.

       --output=VAL
           Determines the format of the output, for use in various programs.
           The default is 'nagios'. Available options are 'nagios', 'mrtg',
           'simple' and 'cacti'.

       --mrtg=VAL
           Used only for the MRTG or simple output, for a few specific
           actions.

       --debugoutput=VAL
           Outputs the exact string returned by psql, for use in debugging.
           The value is one or more letters, which determine if the output is
           displayed or not, where 'a' = all, 'c' = critical, 'w' = warning,
           'o' = ok, and 'u' = unknown. Letters can be combined.

       --get_method=VAL
           Allows specification of the method used to fetch information for
           the "new_version_cp", "new_version_pg", "new_version_bc",
           "new_version_box", and "new_version_tnm" checks.  The following
           programs are tried, in order, to grab the information from the web:
           GET, wget, fetch, curl, lynx, links. To force the use of just one
           (and thus remove the overhead of trying all the others until one of
           those works), enter one of the names as the argument to get_method.
           For example, a BSD box might enter the following line in their
           ".check_postgresrc" file:

             get_method=fetch

       --language=VAL
           Set the language to use for all output messages. Normally, this is
           detected by examining the environment variables LC_ALL,
           LC_MESSAGES, and LANG, but setting this option will override any
           such detection.

ACTIONS
       The action to be run is selected using the --action flag, or by using a
       symlink to the main file that contains the name of the action inside of
       it. For example, to run the action "timesync", you may either issue:

         check_postgres.pl --action=timesync

       or use a program named:

         check_postgres_timesync

       All the symlinks are created for you in the current directory if use
       the option --symlinks:

         perl check_postgres.pl --symlinks

       If the file name already exists, it will not be overwritten. If the
       file exists and is a symlink, you can force it to overwrite by using
       "--action=build_symlinks_force".

       Most actions take a --warning and a --critical option, indicating at
       what point we change from OK to WARNING, and what point we go to
       CRITICAL. Note that because criticals are always checked first, setting
       the warning equal to the critical is an effective way to turn warnings
       off and always give a critical.

       The current supported actions are:

   archive_ready
       ("symlink: check_postgres_archive_ready") Checks how many WAL files
       with extension .ready exist in the pg_xlog/archive_status directory
       (PostgreSQL 10 and later: pg_wal/archive_status), which is found off of
       your data_directory. If the --lsfunc option is not used then this
       action must be run as a superuser, in order to access the contents of
       the pg_xlog/archive_status directory. The minimum version to use this
       action is Postgres 8.1. The --warning and --critical options are simply
       the number of .ready files in the pg_xlog/archive_status directory.
       Usually, these values should be low, turning on the archive mechanism,
       we usually want it to archive WAL files as fast as possible.

       If the archive command fail, number of WAL in your pg_xlog directory
       will grow until exhausting all the disk space and force PostgreSQL to
       stop immediately.

       To avoid running as a database superuser, a wrapper function around
       pg_ls_dir() should be defined as a superuser with SECURITY DEFINER, and
       the --lsfunc option used. This example function, if defined by a
       superuser, will allow the script to connect as a normal user nagios
       with --lsfunc=ls_archive_status_dir

         BEGIN;
         CREATE FUNCTION ls_archive_status_dir()
             RETURNS SETOF TEXT
             AS $$ SELECT pg_ls_dir('pg_xlog/archive_status') $$
             LANGUAGE SQL
             SECURITY DEFINER;
         REVOKE ALL ON FUNCTION ls_archive_status_dir() FROM PUBLIC;
         GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION ls_archive_status_dir() to nagios;
         COMMIT;

       Example 1: Check that the number of ready WAL files is 10 or less on
       host "pluto", using a wrapper function "ls_archive_status_dir" to avoid
       the need for superuser permissions

         check_postgres_archive_ready --host=pluto --critical=10 --lsfunc=ls_archive_status_dir

       For MRTG output, reports the number of ready WAL files on line 1.

   autovac_freeze
       ("symlink: check_postgres_autovac_freeze") Checks how close each
       database is to the Postgres autovacuum_freeze_max_age setting. This
       action will only work for databases version 8.2 or higher. The
       --warning and --critical options should be expressed as percentages.
       The 'age' of the transactions in each database is compared to the
       autovacuum_freeze_max_age setting (200 million by default) to generate
       a rounded percentage. The default values are 90% for the warning and
       95% for the critical. Databases can be filtered by use of the --include
       and --exclude options.  See the "BASIC FILTERING" section for more
       details.

       Example 1: Give a warning when any databases on port 5432 are above 97%

         check_postgres_autovac_freeze --port=5432 --warning="97%"

       For MRTG output, the highest overall percentage is reported on the
       first line, and the highest age is reported on the second line. All
       databases which have the percentage from the first line are reported on
       the fourth line, separated by a pipe symbol.

   backends
       ("symlink: check_postgres_backends") Checks the current number of
       connections for one or more databases, and optionally compares it to
       the maximum allowed, which is determined by the Postgres configuration
       variable max_connections. The --warning and --critical options can take
       one of three forms. First, a simple number can be given, which
       represents the number of connections at which the alert will be given.
       This choice does not use the max_connections setting. Second, the
       percentage of available connections can be given. Third, a negative
       number can be given which represents the number of connections left
       until max_connections is reached. The default values for --warning and
       --critical are '90%' and '95%'.  You can also filter the databases by
       use of the --include and --exclude options.  See the "BASIC FILTERING"
       section for more details.

       To view only non-idle processes, you can use the --noidle argument.
       Note that the user you are running as (either connecting directly or
       switching via --role) must be a superuser for this to work properly.

       Example 1: Give a warning when the number of connections on host quirm
       reaches 120, and a critical if it reaches 150.

         check_postgres_backends --host=quirm --warning=120 --critical=150

       Example 2: Give a critical when we reach 75% of our max_connections
       setting on hosts lancre or lancre2.

         check_postgres_backends --warning='75%' --critical='75%' --host=lancre,lancre2

       Example 3: Give a warning when there are only 10 more connection slots
       left on host plasmid, and a critical when we have only 5 left.

         check_postgres_backends --warning=-10 --critical=-5 --host=plasmid

       Example 4: Check all databases except those with "test" in their name,
       but allow ones that are named "pg_greatest". Connect as port 5432 on
       the first two hosts, and as port 5433 on the third one. We want to
       always throw a critical when we reach 30 or more connections.

        check_postgres_backends --dbhost=hong,kong --dbhost=fooey --dbport=5432 --dbport=5433 --warning=30 --critical=30 --exclude="~test" --include="pg_greatest,~prod"

       For MRTG output, the number of connections is reported on the first
       line, and the fourth line gives the name of the database, plus the
       current maximum_connections. If more than one database has been
       queried, the one with the highest number of connections is output.

   bloat
       ("symlink: check_postgres_bloat") Checks the amount of bloat in tables
       and indexes. (Bloat is generally the amount of dead unused space taken
       up in a table or index. This space is usually reclaimed by use of the
       VACUUM command.) This action requires that stats collection be enabled
       on the target databases, and requires that ANALYZE is run frequently.
       The --include and --exclude options can be used to filter out which
       tables to look at. See the "BASIC FILTERING" section for more details.

       The --warning and --critical options can be specified as sizes,
       percents, or both.  Valid size units are bytes, kilobytes, megabytes,
       gigabytes, terabytes, exabytes, petabytes, and zettabytes. You can
       abbreviate all of those with the first letter. Items without units are
       assumed to be 'bytes'. The default values are '1 GB' and '5 GB'. The
       value represents the number of "wasted bytes", or the difference
       between what is actually used by the table and index, and what we
       compute that it should be.

       Note that this action has two hard-coded values to avoid false alarms
       on smaller relations. Tables must have at least 10 pages, and indexes
       at least 15, before they can be considered by this test. If you really
       want to adjust these values, you can look for the variables $MINPAGES
       and $MINIPAGES at the top of the "check_bloat" subroutine. These values
       are ignored if either --exclude or --include is used.

       Only the top 10 most bloated relations are shown. You can change this
       number by using the --perflimit option to set your own limit.

       The schema named 'information_schema' is excluded from this test, as
       the only tables it contains are small and do not change.

       Please note that the values computed by this action are not precise,
       and should be used as a guideline only. Great effort was made to
       estimate the correct size of a table, but in the end it is only an
       estimate. The correct index size is even more of a guess than the
       correct table size, but both should give a rough idea of how bloated
       things are.

       Example 1: Warn if any table on port 5432 is over 100 MB bloated, and
       critical if over 200 MB

         check_postgres_bloat --port=5432 --warning='100 M' --critical='200 M'

       Example 2: Give a critical if table 'orders' on host 'sami' has more
       than 10 megs of bloat

         check_postgres_bloat --host=sami --include=orders --critical='10 MB'

       Example 3: Give a critical if table 'q4' on database 'sales' is over
       50% bloated

         check_postgres_bloat --db=sales --include=q4 --critical='50%'

       Example 4: Give a critical any table is over 20% bloated and has over
       150 MB of bloat:

         check_postgres_bloat --port=5432 --critical='20% and 150 M'

       Example 5: Give a critical any table is over 40% bloated or has over
       500 MB of bloat:

         check_postgres_bloat --port=5432 --warning='500 M or 40%'

       For MRTG output, the first line gives the highest number of wasted
       bytes for the tables, and the second line gives the highest number of
       wasted bytes for the indexes. The fourth line gives the database name,
       table name, and index name information. If you want to output the bloat
       ratio instead (how many times larger the relation is compared to how
       large it should be), just pass in "--mrtg=ratio".

   checkpoint
       ("symlink: check_postgres_checkpoint") Determines how long since the
       last checkpoint has been run. This must run on the same server as the
       database that is being checked (e.g. the -h flag will not work). This
       check is meant to run on a "warm standby" server that is actively
       processing shipped WAL files, and is meant to check that your warm
       standby is truly 'warm'.  The data directory must be set, either by the
       environment variable "PGDATA", or passing the "--datadir" argument. It
       returns the number of seconds since the last checkpoint was run, as
       determined by parsing the call to "pg_controldata". Because of this,
       the pg_controldata executable must be available in the current path.
       Alternatively, you can specify "PGBINDIR" as the directory that it
       lives in.  It is also possible to use the special options --assume-prod
       or --assume-standby-mode, if the mode found is not the one expected, a
       CRITICAL is emitted.

       At least one warning or critical argument must be set.

       This action requires the Date::Parse module.

       For MRTG or simple output, returns the number of seconds.

   cluster_id
       ("symlink: check_postgres_cluster-id") Checks that the Database System
       Identifier provided by pg_controldata is the same as last time you
       checked. This must run on the same server as the database that is being
       checked (e.g. the -h flag will not work).  Either the --warning or the
       --critical option should be given, but not both. The value of each one
       is the cluster identifier, an integer value. You can run with the
       special "--critical=0" option to find out an existing cluster
       identifier.

       Example 1: Find the initial identifier

         check_postgres_cluster_id --critical=0 --datadir=/var//lib/postgresql/9.0/main

       Example 2: Make sure the cluster is the same and warn if not, using the
       result from above.

         check_postgres_cluster_id  --critical=5633695740047915135

       For MRTG output, returns a 1 or 0 indicating success of failure of the
       identifier to match. A identifier must be provided as the "--mrtg"
       argument. The fourth line always gives the current identifier.

   commitratio
       ("symlink: check_postgres_commitratio") Checks the commit ratio of all
       databases and complains when they are too low.  There is no need to run
       this command more than once per database cluster.  Databases can be
       filtered with the --include and --exclude options. See the "BASIC
       FILTERING" section for more details.  They can also be filtered by the
       owner of the database with the --includeuser and --excludeuser options.
       See the "USER NAME FILTERING" section for more details.

       The warning and critical options should be specified as percentages.
       There are not defaults for this action: the warning and critical must
       be specified. The warning value cannot be greater than the critical
       value. The output returns all databases sorted by commitratio, smallest
       first.

       Example: Warn if any database on host flagg is less than 90% in
       commitratio, and critical if less then 80%.

         check_postgres_database_commitratio --host=flagg --warning='90%' --critical='80%'

       For MRTG output, returns the percentage of the database with the
       smallest commitratio on the first line, and the name of the database on
       the fourth line.

   connection
       ("symlink: check_postgres_connection") Simply connects, issues a
       'SELECT version()', and leaves.  Takes no --warning or --critical
       options.

       For MRTG output, simply outputs a 1 (good connection) or a 0 (bad
       connection) on the first line.

   custom_query
       ("symlink: check_postgres_custom_query") Runs a custom query of your
       choosing, and parses the results.  The query itself is passed in
       through the "query" argument, and should be kept as simple as possible.
       If at all possible, wrap it in a view or a function to keep things
       easier to manage. The query should return one or two columns. It is
       required that one of the columns be named "result" and is the item that
       will be checked against your warning and critical values. The second
       column is for the performance data and any name can be used: this will
       be the 'value' inside the performance data section.

       At least one warning or critical argument must be specified. What these
       are set to depends on the type of query you are running. There are four
       types of custom_queries that can be run, specified by the "valtype"
       argument. If none is specified, this action defaults to 'integer'. The
       four types are:

       integer: Does a simple integer comparison. The first column should be a
       simple integer, and the warning and critical values should be the same.

       string: The warning and critical are strings, and are triggered only if
       the value in the first column matches it exactly. This is case-
       sensitive.

       time: The warning and the critical are times, and can have units of
       seconds, minutes, hours, or days.  Each may be written singular or
       abbreviated to just the first letter. If no units are given, seconds
       are assumed. The first column should be an integer representing the
       number of seconds to check.

       size: The warning and the critical are sizes, and can have units of
       bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes, or exabytes. Each
       may be abbreviated to the first letter. If no units are given, bytes
       are assumed. The first column should be an integer representing the
       number of bytes to check.

       Normally, an alert is triggered if the values returned are greater than
       or equal to the critical or warning value. However, an option of
       --reverse will trigger the alert if the returned value is lower than or
       equal to the critical or warning value.

       Example 1: Warn if any relation over 100 pages is named "rad", put the
       number of pages inside the performance data section.

         check_postgres_custom_query --valtype=string -w "rad" --query=
           "SELECT relname AS result, relpages AS pages FROM pg_class WHERE relpages > 100"

       Example 2: Give a critical if the "foobar" function returns a number
       over 5MB:

         check_postgres_custom_query --critical='5MB'--valtype=size --query="SELECT foobar() AS result"

       Example 2: Warn if the function "snazzo" returns less than 42:

         check_postgres_custom_query --critical=42 --query="SELECT snazzo() AS result" --reverse

       If you come up with a useful custom_query, consider sending in a patch
       to this program to make it into a standard action that other people can
       use.

       This action does not support MRTG or simple output yet.

   database_size
       ("symlink: check_postgres_database_size") Checks the size of all
       databases and complains when they are too big.  There is no need to run
       this command more than once per database cluster.  Databases can be
       filtered with the --include and --exclude options. See the "BASIC
       FILTERING" section for more details.  They can also be filtered by the
       owner of the database with the --includeuser and --excludeuser options.
       See the "USER NAME FILTERING" section for more details.

       The warning and critical options can be specified as bytes, kilobytes,
       megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes, or exabytes. Each may be abbreviated
       to the first letter as well.  If no unit is given, the units are
       assumed to be bytes. There are not defaults for this action: the
       warning and critical must be specified. The warning value cannot be
       greater than the critical value. The output returns all databases
       sorted by size largest first, showing both raw bytes and a "pretty"
       version of the size.

       Example 1: Warn if any database on host flagg is over 1 TB in size, and
       critical if over 1.1 TB.

         check_postgres_database_size --host=flagg --warning='1 TB' --critical='1.1 t'

       Example 2: Give a critical if the database template1 on port 5432 is
       over 10 MB.

         check_postgres_database_size --port=5432 --include=template1 --warning='10MB' --critical='10MB'

       Example 3: Give a warning if any database on host 'tardis' owned by the
       user 'tom' is over 5 GB

         check_postgres_database_size --host=tardis --includeuser=tom --warning='5 GB' --critical='10 GB'

       For MRTG output, returns the size in bytes of the largest database on
       the first line, and the name of the database on the fourth line.

   dbstats
       ("symlink: check_postgres_dbstats") Reports information from the
       pg_stat_database view, and outputs it in a Cacti-friendly manner. No
       other output is supported, as the output is informational and does not
       lend itself to alerts, such as used with Nagios. If no options are
       given, all databases are returned, one per line. You can include a
       specific database by use of the "--include" option, or you can use the
       "--dbname" option.

       Eleven items are returned on each line, in the format name:value,
       separated by a single space. The items are:

       backends
           The number of currently running backends for this database.

       commits
           The total number of commits for this database since it was created
           or reset.

       rollbacks
           The total number of rollbacks for this database since it was
           created or reset.

       read
           The total number of disk blocks read.

       hit The total number of buffer hits.

       ret The total number of rows returned.

       fetch
           The total number of rows fetched.

       ins The total number of rows inserted.

       upd The total number of rows updated.

       del The total number of rows deleted.

       dbname
           The name of the database.

       Note that ret, fetch, ins, upd, and del items will always be 0 if
       Postgres is version 8.2 or lower, as those stats were not available in
       those versions.

       If the dbname argument is given, seven additional items are returned:

       idxscan
           Total number of user index scans.

       idxtupread
           Total number of user index entries returned.

       idxtupfetch
           Total number of rows fetched by simple user index scans.

       idxblksread
           Total number of disk blocks read for all user indexes.

       idxblkshit
           Total number of buffer hits for all user indexes.

       seqscan
           Total number of sequential scans against all user tables.

       seqtupread
           Total number of tuples returned from all user tables.

       Example 1: Grab the stats for a database named "products" on host
       "willow":

         check_postgres_dbstats --dbhost willow --dbname products

       The output returned will be like this (all on one line, not wrapped):

           backends:82 commits:58374408 rollbacks:1651 read:268435543 hit:2920381758 idxscan:310931294 idxtupread:2777040927
           idxtupfetch:1840241349 idxblksread:62860110 idxblkshit:1107812216 seqscan:5085305 seqtupread:5370500520
           ret:0 fetch:0 ins:0 upd:0 del:0 dbname:willow

   disabled_triggers
       ("symlink: check_postgres_disabled_triggers") Checks on the number of
       disabled triggers inside the database.  The --warning and --critical
       options are the number of such triggers found, and both default to "1",
       as in normal usage having disabled triggers is a dangerous event. If
       the database being checked is 8.3 or higher, the check is for the
       number of triggers that are in a 'disabled' status (as opposed to being
       'always' or 'replica'). The output will show the name of the table and
       the name of the trigger for each disabled trigger.

       Example 1: Make sure that there are no disabled triggers

         check_postgres_disabled_triggers

       For MRTG output, returns the number of disabled triggers on the first
       line.

   disk_space
       ("symlink: check_postgres_disk_space") Checks on the available physical
       disk space used by Postgres. This action requires that you have the
       executable "/bin/df" available to report on disk sizes, and it also
       needs to be run as a superuser (either connecting directly or switching
       via --role), so it can examine the data_directory setting inside of
       Postgres. The --warning and --critical options are given in either
       sizes or percentages or both. If using sizes, the standard unit types
       are allowed: bytes, kilobytes, gigabytes, megabytes, gigabytes,
       terabytes, or exabytes. Each may be abbreviated to the first letter
       only; no units at all indicates 'bytes'. The default values are '90%'
       and '95%'.

       This command checks the following things to determine all of the
       different physical disks being used by Postgres.

       data_directory - The disk that the main data directory is on.

       log directory - The disk that the log files are on.

       WAL file directory - The disk that the write-ahead logs are on (e.g.
       symlinked pg_xlog or pg_wal)

       tablespaces - Each tablespace that is on a separate disk.

       The output shows the total size used and available on each disk, as
       well as the percentage, ordered by highest to lowest percentage used.
       Each item above maps to a file system: these can be included or
       excluded. See the "BASIC FILTERING" section for more details.

       Example 1: Make sure that no file system is over 90% for the database
       on port 5432.

         check_postgres_disk_space --port=5432 --warning='90%' --critical='90%'

       Example 2: Check that all file systems starting with /dev/sda are
       smaller than 10 GB and 11 GB (warning and critical)

         check_postgres_disk_space --port=5432 --warning='10 GB' --critical='11 GB' --include="~^/dev/sda"

       Example 4: Make sure that no file system is both over 50% and has over
       15 GB

         check_postgres_disk_space --critical='50% and 15 GB'

       Example 5: Issue a warning if any file system is either over 70% full
       or has more than 1T

         check_postgres_disk_space --warning='1T or 75'

       For MRTG output, returns the size in bytes of the file system on the
       first line, and the name of the file system on the fourth line.

   fsm_pages
       ("symlink: check_postgres_fsm_pages") Checks how close a cluster is to
       the Postgres max_fsm_pages setting.  This action will only work for
       databases of 8.2 or higher, and it requires the contrib module
       pg_freespacemap be installed. The --warning and --critical options
       should be expressed as percentages. The number of used pages in the
       free-space-map is determined by looking in the
       pg_freespacemap_relations view, and running a formula based on the
       formula used for outputting free-space-map pageslots in the vacuum
       verbose command. The default values are 85% for the warning and 95% for
       the critical.

       Example 1: Give a warning when our cluster has used up 76% of the free-
       space pageslots, with pg_freespacemap installed in database robert

         check_postgres_fsm_pages --dbname=robert --warning="76%"

       While you need to pass in the name of the database where
       pg_freespacemap is installed, you only need to run this check once per
       cluster. Also, checking this information does require obtaining special
       locks on the free-space-map, so it is recommend you do not run this
       check with short intervals.

       For MRTG output, returns the percent of free-space-map on the first
       line, and the number of pages currently used on the second line.

   fsm_relations
       ("symlink: check_postgres_fsm_relations") Checks how close a cluster is
       to the Postgres max_fsm_relations setting.  This action will only work
       for databases of 8.2 or higher, and it requires the contrib module
       pg_freespacemap be installed. The --warning and --critical options
       should be expressed as percentages. The number of used relations in the
       free-space-map is determined by looking in the
       pg_freespacemap_relations view. The default values are 85% for the
       warning and 95% for the critical.

       Example 1: Give a warning when our cluster has used up 80% of the free-
       space relations, with pg_freespacemap installed in database dylan

         check_postgres_fsm_relations --dbname=dylan --warning="75%"

       While you need to pass in the name of the database where
       pg_freespacemap is installed, you only need to run this check once per
       cluster. Also, checking this information does require obtaining special
       locks on the free-space-map, so it is recommend you do not run this
       check with short intervals.

       For MRTG output, returns the percent of free-space-map on the first
       line, the number of relations currently used on the second line.

   hitratio
       ("symlink: check_postgres_hitratio") Checks the hit ratio of all
       databases and complains when they are too low.  There is no need to run
       this command more than once per database cluster.  Databases can be
       filtered with the --include and --exclude options. See the "BASIC
       FILTERING" section for more details.  They can also be filtered by the
       owner of the database with the --includeuser and --excludeuser options.
       See the "USER NAME FILTERING" section for more details.

       The warning and critical options should be specified as percentages.
       There are not defaults for this action: the warning and critical must
       be specified. The warning value cannot be greater than the critical
       value. The output returns all databases sorted by hitratio, smallest
       first.

       Example: Warn if any database on host flagg is less than 90% in
       hitratio, and critical if less then 80%.

         check_postgres_hitratio --host=flagg --warning='90%' --critical='80%'

       For MRTG output, returns the percentage of the database with the
       smallest hitratio on the first line, and the name of the database on
       the fourth line.

   hot_standby_delay
       ("symlink: check_hot_standby_delay") Checks the streaming replication
       lag by computing the delta between the current xlog position of a
       master server and the replay location of a slave connected to it. The
       slave server must be in hot_standby (e.g. read only) mode, therefore
       the minimum version to use this action is Postgres 9.0. The --warning
       and --critical options are the delta between the xlog locations. Since
       these values are byte offsets in the WAL they should match the expected
       transaction volume of your application to prevent false positives or
       negatives.

       The first "--dbname", "--host", and "--port", etc. options are
       considered the master; the second belongs to the slave.

       Byte values should be based on the volume of transactions needed to
       have the streaming replication disconnect from the master because of
       too much lag, determined by the Postgres configuration variable
       wal_keep_segments.  For units of time, valid units are 'seconds',
       'minutes', 'hours', or 'days'.  Each may be written singular or
       abbreviated to just the first letter. When specifying both, in the form
       'bytes and time', both conditions must be true for the threshold to be
       met.

       You must provide information on how to reach the databases by providing
       a comma separated list to the --dbhost and --dbport parameters, such as
       "--dbport=5432,5543". If not given, the action fails.

       Example 1: Warn a database with a local replica on port 5433 is behind
       on any xlog replay at all

         check_hot_standby_delay --dbport=5432,5433 --warning='1'

       Example 2: Give a critical if the last transaction replica1 receives is
       more than 10 minutes ago

         check_hot_standby_delay --dbhost=master,replica1 --critical='10 min'

       Example 3: Allow replica1 to be 1 WAL segment behind, if the master is
       momentarily seeing more activity than the streaming replication
       connection can handle, or 10 minutes behind, if the master is seeing
       very little activity and not processing any transactions, but not both,
       which would indicate a lasting problem with the replication connection.

         check_hot_standby_delay --dbhost=master,replica1 --warning='1048576 and 2 min' --critical='16777216 and 10 min'

   relation_size
   index_size
   table_size
   indexes_size
   total_relation_size
       (symlinks: "check_postgres_relation_size", "check_postgres_index_size",
       "check_postgres_table_size", "check_postgres_indexes_size", and
       "check_postgres_total_relation_size")

       The actions relation_size and index_size check for a relation (table,
       index, materialized view), respectively an index that has grown too
       big, using the pg_relation_size() function.

       The action table_size checks tables and materialized views using
       pg_table_size(), i.e. including relation forks and TOAST table.

       The action indexes_size checks tables and materialized views for the
       size of the attached indexes using pg_indexes_size().

       The action total_relation_size checks relations using
       pg_total_relation_size(), i.e. including relation forks, indexes and
       TOAST table.

       Relations can be filtered with the --include and --exclude options. See
       the "BASIC FILTERING" section for more details. Relations can also be
       filtered by the user that owns them, by using the --includeuser and
       --excludeuser options.  See the "USER NAME FILTERING" section for more
       details.

       The values for the --warning and --critical options are file sizes, and
       may have units of bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes, or
       exabytes.  Each can be abbreviated to the first letter. If no units are
       given, bytes are assumed. There are no default values: both the warning
       and the critical option must be given. The return text shows the size
       of the largest relation found.

       If the --showperf option is enabled, all of the relations with their
       sizes will be given. To prevent this, it is recommended that you set
       the --perflimit option, which will cause the query to do a "ORDER BY
       size DESC LIMIT (perflimit)".

       Example 1: Give a critical if any table is larger than 600MB on host
       burrick.

         check_postgres_table_size --critical='600 MB' --warning='600 MB' --host=burrick

       Example 2: Warn if the table products is over 4 GB in size, and give a
       critical at 4.5 GB.

         check_postgres_table_size --host=burrick --warning='4 GB' --critical='4.5 GB' --include=products

       Example 3: Warn if any index not owned by postgres goes over 500 MB.

         check_postgres_index_size --port=5432 --excludeuser=postgres -w 500MB -c 600MB

       For MRTG output, returns the size in bytes of the largest relation, and
       the name of the database and relation as the fourth line.

   last_analyze
   last_vacuum
   last_autoanalyze
   last_autovacuum
       (symlinks: "check_postgres_last_analyze", "check_postgres_last_vacuum",
       "check_postgres_last_autoanalyze", and
       "check_postgres_last_autovacuum") Checks how long it has been since
       vacuum (or analyze) was last run on each table in one or more
       databases. Use of these actions requires that the target database is
       version 8.3 or greater, or that the version is 8.2 and the
       configuration variable stats_row_level has been enabled. Tables can be
       filtered with the --include and --exclude options. See the "BASIC
       FILTERING" section for more details.  Tables can also be filtered by
       their owner by use of the --includeuser and --excludeuser options.  See
       the "USER NAME FILTERING" section for more details.

       The units for --warning and --critical are specified as times.  Valid
       units are seconds, minutes, hours, and days; all can be abbreviated to
       the first letter. If no units are given, 'seconds' are assumed. The
       default values are '1 day' and '2 days'. Please note that there are
       cases in which this field does not get automatically populated. If
       certain tables are giving you problems, make sure that they have dead
       rows to vacuum, or just exclude them from the test.

       The schema named 'information_schema' is excluded from this test, as
       the only tables it contains are small and do not change.

       Note that the non-'auto' versions will also check on the auto versions
       as well. In other words, using last_vacuum will report on the last
       vacuum, whether it was a normal vacuum, or one run by the autovacuum
       daemon.

       Example 1: Warn if any table has not been vacuumed in 3 days, and give
       a critical at a week, for host wormwood

         check_postgres_last_vacuum --host=wormwood --warning='3d' --critical='7d'

       Example 2: Same as above, but skip tables belonging to the users 'eve'
       or 'mallory'

         check_postgres_last_vacuum --host=wormwood --warning='3d' --critical='7d' --excludeuser=eve,mallory

       For MRTG output, returns (on the first line) the LEAST amount of time
       in seconds since a table was last vacuumed or analyzed. The fourth line
       returns the name of the database and name of the table.

   listener
       ("symlink: check_postgres_listener") Confirm that someone is listening
       for one or more specific strings (using the LISTEN/NOTIFY system), by
       looking at the pg_listener table.  Only one of warning or critical is
       needed. The format is a simple string representing the LISTEN target,
       or a tilde character followed by a string for a regular expression
       check.  Note that this check will not work on versions of Postgres 9.0
       or higher.

       Example 1: Give a warning if nobody is listening for the string
       bucardo_mcp_ping on ports 5555 and 5556

         check_postgres_listener --port=5555,5556 --warning=bucardo_mcp_ping

       Example 2: Give a critical if there are no active LISTEN requests
       matching 'grimm' on database oskar

         check_postgres_listener --db oskar --critical=~grimm

       For MRTG output, returns a 1 or a 0 on the first, indicating success or
       failure. The name of the notice must be provided via the --mrtg option.

   locks
       ("symlink: check_postgres_locks") Check the total number of locks on
       one or more databases. There is no need to run this more than once per
       database cluster. Databases can be filtered with the --include and
       --exclude options. See the "BASIC FILTERING" section for more details.

       The --warning and --critical options can be specified as simple
       numbers, which represent the total number of locks, or they can be
       broken down by type of lock.  Valid lock names are 'total', 'waiting',
       or the name of a lock type used by Postgres.  These names are case-
       insensitive and do not need the "lock" part on the end, so exclusive
       will match 'ExclusiveLock'. The format is name=number, with different
       items separated by colons or semicolons (or any other symbol).

       Example 1: Warn if the number of locks is 100 or more, and critical if
       200 or more, on host garrett

         check_postgres_locks --host=garrett --warning=100 --critical=200

       Example 2: On the host artemus, warn if 200 or more locks exist, and
       give a critical if over 250 total locks exist, or if over 20 exclusive
       locks exist, or if over 5 connections are waiting for a lock.

         check_postgres_locks --host=artemus --warning=200 --critical="total=250:waiting=5:exclusive=20"

       For MRTG output, returns the number of locks on the first line, and the
       name of the database on the fourth line.

   logfile
       ("symlink: check_postgres_logfile") Ensures that the logfile is in the
       expected location and is being logged to.  This action issues a command
       that throws an error on each database it is checking, and ensures that
       the message shows up in the logs. It scans the various log_* settings
       inside of Postgres to figure out where the logs should be.  If you are
       using syslog, it does a rough (but not foolproof) scan of
       /etc/syslog.conf. Alternatively, you can provide the name of the
       logfile with the --logfile option. This is especially useful if the
       logs have a custom rotation scheme driven be an external program. The
       --logfile option supports the following escape characters: "%Y %m %d
       %H", which represent the current year, month, date, and hour
       respectively. An error is always reported as critical unless the
       warning option has been passed in as a non-zero value. Other than that
       specific usage, the "--warning" and "--critical" options should not be
       used.

       Example 1: On port 5432, ensure the logfile is being written to the
       file /home/greg/pg8.2.log

         check_postgres_logfile --port=5432 --logfile=/home/greg/pg8.2.log

       Example 2: Same as above, but raise a warning, not a critical

         check_postgres_logfile --port=5432 --logfile=/home/greg/pg8.2.log -w 1

       For MRTG output, returns a 1 or 0 on the first line, indicating success
       or failure. In case of a failure, the fourth line will provide more
       detail on the failure encountered.

   new_version_bc
       ("symlink: check_postgres_new_version_bc") Checks if a newer version of
       the Bucardo program is available. The current version is obtained by
       running "bucardo_ctl --version".  If a major upgrade is available, a
       warning is returned. If a revision upgrade is available, a critical is
       returned. (Bucardo is a master to slave, and master to master
       replication system for Postgres: see <https://bucardo.org/> for more
       information).  See also the information on the "--get_method" option.

   new_version_box
       ("symlink: check_postgres_new_version_box") Checks if a newer version
       of the boxinfo program is available. The current version is obtained by
       running "boxinfo.pl --version".  If a major upgrade is available, a
       warning is returned. If a revision upgrade is available, a critical is
       returned. (boxinfo is a program for grabbing important information from
       a server and putting it into a HTML format: see
       <https://bucardo.org/Boxinfo/> for more information). See also the
       information on the "--get_method" option.

   new_version_cp
       ("symlink: check_postgres_new_version_cp") Checks if a newer version of
       this program (check_postgres.pl) is available, by grabbing the version
       from a small text file on the main page of the home page for the
       project. Returns a warning if the returned version does not match the
       one you are running. Recommended interval to check is once a day. See
       also the information on the "--get_method" option.

   new_version_pg
       ("symlink: check_postgres_new_version_pg") Checks if a newer revision
       of Postgres exists for each database connected to. Note that this only
       checks for revision, e.g.  going from 8.3.6 to 8.3.7. Revisions are
       always 100% binary compatible and involve no dump and restore to
       upgrade. Revisions are made to address bugs, so upgrading as soon as
       possible is always recommended. Returns a warning if you do not have
       the latest revision.  It is recommended this check is run at least once
       a day. See also the information on the "--get_method" option.

   new_version_tnm
       ("symlink: check_postgres_new_version_tnm") Checks if a newer version
       of the tail_n_mail program is available. The current version is
       obtained by running "tail_n_mail --version". If a major upgrade is
       available, a warning is returned. If a revision upgrade is available, a
       critical is returned. (tail_n_mail is a log monitoring tool that can
       send mail when interesting events appear in your Postgres logs.  See:
       <https://bucardo.org/tail_n_mail/> for more information).  See also the
       information on the "--get_method" option.

   pgb_pool_cl_active

   pgb_pool_maxwait
       (symlinks: "check_postgres_pgb_pool_cl_active",
       "check_postgres_pgb_pool_cl_waiting",
       "check_postgres_pgb_pool_sv_active", "check_postgres_pgb_pool_sv_idle",
       "check_postgres_pgb_pool_sv_used", "check_postgres_pgb_pool_sv_tested",
       "check_postgres_pgb_pool_sv_login", and
       "check_postgres_pgb_pool_maxwait")

       Examines pgbouncer's pool statistics. Each pool has a set of "client"
       connections, referring to connections from external clients, and
       "server" connections, referring to connections to PostgreSQL itself.
       The related check_postgres actions are prefixed by "cl_" and "sv_",
       respectively. Active client connections are those connections currently
       linked with an active server connection. Client connections may also be
       "waiting", meaning they have not yet been allocated a server
       connection. Server connections are "active" (linked to a client),
       "idle" (standing by for a client connection to link with), "used" (just
       unlinked from a client, and not yet returned to the idle pool),
       "tested" (currently being tested) and "login" (in the process of
       logging in). The maxwait value shows how long in seconds the oldest
       waiting client connection has been waiting.

   pgbouncer_backends
       ("symlink: check_postgres_pgbouncer_backends") Checks the current
       number of connections for one or more databases through pgbouncer, and
       optionally compares it to the maximum allowed, which is determined by
       the pgbouncer configuration variable max_client_conn. The --warning and
       --critical options can take one of three forms. First, a simple number
       can be given, which represents the number of connections at which the
       alert will be given.  This choice does not use the max_connections
       setting. Second, the percentage of available connections can be given.
       Third, a negative number can be given which represents the number of
       connections left until max_connections is reached. The default values
       for --warning and --critical are '90%' and '95%'.  You can also filter
       the databases by use of the --include and --exclude options.  See the
       "BASIC FILTERING" section for more details.

       To view only non-idle processes, you can use the --noidle argument.
       Note that the user you are running as (either connecting directly or
       switching via --role) must be a superuser for this to work properly.

       Example 1: Give a warning when the number of connections on host quirm
       reaches 120, and a critical if it reaches 150.

         check_postgres_pgbouncer_backends --host=quirm --warning=120 --critical=150 -p 6432 -u pgbouncer

       Example 2: Give a critical when we reach 75% of our max_connections
       setting on hosts lancre or lancre2.

         check_postgres_pgbouncer_backends --warning='75%' --critical='75%' --host=lancre,lancre2 -p 6432 -u pgbouncer

       Example 3: Give a warning when there are only 10 more connection slots
       left on host plasmid, and a critical when we have only 5 left.

         check_postgres_pgbouncer_backends --warning=-10 --critical=-5 --host=plasmid -p 6432 -u pgbouncer

       For MRTG output, the number of connections is reported on the first
       line, and the fourth line gives the name of the database, plus the
       current max_client_conn. If more than one database has been queried,
       the one with the highest number of connections is output.

   pgbouncer_checksum
       ("symlink: check_postgres_pgbouncer_checksum") Checks that all the
       pgBouncer settings are the same as last time you checked.  This is done
       by generating a checksum of a sorted list of setting names and their
       values. Note that you shouldn't specify the database name, it will
       automatically default to pgbouncer.  Either the --warning or the
       --critical option should be given, but not both. The value of each one
       is the checksum, a 32-character hexadecimal value. You can run with the
       special "--critical=0" option to find out an existing checksum.

       This action requires the Digest::MD5 module.

       Example 1: Find the initial checksum for pgbouncer configuration on
       port 6432 using the default user (usually postgres)

         check_postgres_pgbouncer_checksum --port=6432 --critical=0

       Example 2: Make sure no settings have changed and warn if so, using the
       checksum from above.

         check_postgres_pgbouncer_checksum --port=6432 --warning=cd2f3b5e129dc2b4f5c0f6d8d2e64231

       For MRTG output, returns a 1 or 0 indicating success of failure of the
       checksum to match. A checksum must be provided as the "--mrtg"
       argument. The fourth line always gives the current checksum.

   pgbouncer_maxwait
       ("symlink: check_postgres_pgbouncer_maxwait") Checks how long the first
       (oldest) client in the queue has been waiting, in seconds. If this
       starts increasing, then the current pool of servers does not handle
       requests quick enough. Reason may be either overloaded server or just
       too small of a pool_size setting in pbouncer config file.  Databases
       can be filtered by use of the --include and --exclude options. See the
       "BASIC FILTERING" section for more details.  The values or the
       --warning and --critical options are units of time, and must be
       provided (no default). Valid units are 'seconds', 'minutes', 'hours',
       or 'days'. Each may be written singular or abbreviated to just the
       first letter.  If no units are given, the units are assumed to be
       seconds.

       This action requires Postgres 8.3 or better.

       Example 1: Give a critical if any transaction has been open for more
       than 10 minutes:

         check_postgres_pgbouncer_maxwait -p 6432 -u pgbouncer --critical='10 minutes'

       For MRTG output, returns the maximum time in seconds a transaction has
       been open on the first line. The fourth line gives the name of the
       database.

   pgagent_jobs
       ("symlink: check_postgres_pgagent_jobs") Checks that all the pgAgent
       jobs that have executed in the preceding interval of time have
       succeeded. This is done by checking for any steps that have a non-zero
       result.

       Either "--warning" or "--critical", or both, may be specified as times,
       and jobs will be checked for failures withing the specified periods of
       time before the current time. Valid units are seconds, minutes, hours,
       and days; all can be abbreviated to the first letter. If no units are
       given, 'seconds' are assumed.

       Example 1: Give a critical when any jobs executed in the last day have
       failed.

         check_postgres_pgagent_jobs --critical=1d

       Example 2: Give a warning when any jobs executed in the last week have
       failed.

         check_postgres_pgagent_jobs --warning=7d

       Example 3: Give a critical for jobs that have failed in the last 2
       hours and a warning for jobs that have failed in the last 4 hours:

         check_postgres_pgagent_jobs --critical=2h --warning=4h

   prepared_txns
       ("symlink: check_postgres_prepared_txns") Check on the age of any
       existing prepared transactions.  Note that most people will NOT use
       prepared transactions, as they are part of two-part commit and
       complicated to maintain. They should also not be confused with prepared
       STATEMENTS, which is what most people think of when they hear prepare.
       The default value for a warning is 1 second, to detect any use of
       prepared transactions, which is probably a mistake on most systems.
       Warning and critical are the number of seconds a prepared transaction
       has been open before an alert is given.

       Example 1: Give a warning on detecting any prepared transactions:

         check_postgres_prepared_txns -w 0

       Example 2: Give a critical if any prepared transaction has been open
       longer than 10 seconds, but allow up to 360 seconds for the database
       'shrike':

         check_postgres_prepared_txns --critical=10 --exclude=shrike
         check_postgres_prepared_txns --critical=360 --include=shrike

       For MRTG output, returns the number of seconds the oldest transaction
       has been open as the first line, and which database is came from as the
       final line.

   query_runtime
       ("symlink: check_postgres_query_runtime") Checks how long a specific
       query takes to run, by executing a "EXPLAIN ANALYZE" against it. The
       --warning and --critical options are the maximum amount of time the
       query should take. Valid units are seconds, minutes, and hours; any can
       be abbreviated to the first letter. If no units are given, 'seconds'
       are assumed.  Both the warning and the critical option must be given.
       The name of the view or function to be run must be passed in to the
       --queryname option. It must consist of a single word (or schema.word),
       with optional parens at the end.

       Example 1: Give a critical if the function named "speedtest" fails to
       run in 10 seconds or less.

         check_postgres_query_runtime --queryname='speedtest()' --critical=10 --warning=10

       For MRTG output, reports the time in seconds for the query to complete
       on the first line. The fourth line lists the database.

   query_time
       ("symlink: check_postgres_query_time") Checks the length of running
       queries on one or more databases.  There is no need to run this more
       than once on the same database cluster. Note that this already excludes
       queries that are "idle in transaction". Databases can be filtered by
       using the --include and --exclude options. See the "BASIC FILTERING"
       section for more details. You can also filter on the user running the
       query with the --includeuser and --excludeuser options.  See the "USER
       NAME FILTERING" section for more details.

       The values for the --warning and --critical options are amounts of
       time, and at least one must be provided (no defaults). Valid units are
       'seconds', 'minutes', 'hours', or 'days'. Each may be written singular
       or abbreviated to just the first letter. If no units are given, the
       unit is assumed to be seconds.

       This action requires Postgres 8.1 or better.

       Example 1: Give a warning if any query has been running longer than 3
       minutes, and a critical if longer than 5 minutes.

         check_postgres_query_time --port=5432 --warning='3 minutes' --critical='5 minutes'

       Example 2: Using default values (2 and 5 minutes), check all databases
       except those starting with 'template'.

         check_postgres_query_time --port=5432 --exclude=~^template

       Example 3: Warn if user 'don' has a query running over 20 seconds

         check_postgres_query_time --port=5432 --includeuser=don --warning=20s

       For MRTG output, returns the length in seconds of the longest running
       query on the first line. The fourth line gives the name of the
       database.

   replicate_row
       ("symlink: check_postgres_replicate_row") Checks that master-slave
       replication is working to one or more slaves.

       The first "--dbname", "--host", and "--port", etc. options are
       considered the master; subsequent uses are the slaves.  The values or
       the --warning and --critical options are units of time, and at least
       one must be provided (no defaults). Valid units are 'seconds',
       'minutes', 'hours', or 'days'. Each may be written singular or
       abbreviated to just the first letter.  If no units are given, the units
       are assumed to be seconds.

       This check updates a single row on the master, and then measures how
       long it takes to be applied to the slaves. To do this, you need to pick
       a table that is being replicated, then find a row that can be changed,
       and is not going to be changed by any other process. A specific column
       of this row will be changed from one value to another. All of this is
       fed to the "repinfo" option, and should contain the following options,
       separated by commas: table name, primary key, key id, column, first
       value, second value.

       Example 1: Slony is replicating a table named 'orders' from host
       'alpha' to host 'beta', in the database 'sales'. The primary key of the
       table is named id, and we are going to test the row with an id of 3
       (which is historical and never changed). There is a column named
       'salesrep' that we are going to toggle from a value of 'slon' to 'nols'
       to check on the replication. We want to throw a warning if the
       replication does not happen within 10 seconds.

         check_postgres_replicate_row --host=alpha --dbname=sales --host=beta
         --dbname=sales --warning=10 --repinfo=orders,id,3,salesrep,slon,nols

       Example 2: Bucardo is replicating a table named 'receipt' from host
       'green' to hosts 'red', 'blue', and 'yellow'. The database for both
       sides is 'public'.  The slave databases are running on port 5455. The
       primary key is named 'receipt_id', the row we want to use has a value
       of 9, and the column we want to change for the test is called 'zone'.
       We'll toggle between 'north' and 'south' for the value of this column,
       and throw a critical if the change is not on all three slaves within 5
       seconds.

        check_postgres_replicate_row --host=green --port=5455 --host=red,blue,yellow
         --critical=5 --repinfo=receipt,receipt_id,9,zone,north,south

       For MRTG output, returns on the first line the time in seconds the
       replication takes to finish.  The maximum time is set to 4 minutes 30
       seconds: if no replication has taken place in that long a time, an
       error is thrown.

   replication_slots
       ("symlink: check_postgres_replication_slots")  Check the quantity of
       WAL retained for any replication slots in the target database cluster.
       This is handy for monitoring environments where all WAL archiving and
       replication is taking place over replication slots.

       Warning and critical are total bytes retained for the slot. E.g:

         check_postgres_replication_slots --port=5432 --host=yellow -warning=32M -critical=64M

       Specific named slots can be monitored using --include/--exclude

   same_schema
       ("symlink: check_postgres_same_schema") Verifies that two or more
       databases are identical as far as their schema (but not the data
       within). Unlike most other actions, this has no warning or critical
       criteria - the databases are either in sync, or are not. If they are
       different, a detailed list of the differences is presented.

       You may want to exclude or filter out certain differences. The way to
       do this is to add strings to the "--filter" option. To exclude a type
       of object, use "noname", where 'name' is the type of object, for
       example, "noschema". To exclude objects of a certain type by a regular
       expression against their name, use "noname=regex". See the examples
       below for a better understanding.

       The types of objects that can be filtered include:

       user
       schema
       table
       view
       index
       sequence
       constraint
       trigger
       function

       The filter option "noposition"  prevents verification of the position
       of columns within a table.

       The filter option "nofuncbody" prevents comparison of the bodies of all
       functions.

       The filter option "noperm" prevents comparison of object permissions.

       To provide the second database, just append the differences to the
       first one by a call to the appropriate connection argument. For
       example, to compare databases on hosts alpha and bravo, use
       "--dbhost=alpha,bravo". Also see the examples below.

       If only a single host is given, it is assumed we are doing a "time-
       based" report.  The first time this is run a snapshot of all the items
       in the database is saved to a local file. When you run it again, that
       snapshot is read in and becomes "database #2" and is compared to the
       current database.

       To replace the old stored file with the new version, use the --replace
       argument.

       If you need to write the stored file to a specific directory, use the
       --audit-file-dir argument.

       To avoid false positives on value based checks caused by replication
       lag on asynchronous replicas, use the --assume-async option.

       To enable snapshots at various points in time, you can use the
       "--suffix" argument to make the filenames unique to each run. See the
       examples below.

       Example 1: Verify that two databases on hosts star and line are the
       same:

         check_postgres_same_schema --dbhost=star,line

       Example 2: Same as before, but exclude any triggers with "slony" in
       their name

         check_postgres_same_schema --dbhost=star,line --filter="notrigger=slony"

       Example 3: Same as before, but also exclude all indexes

         check_postgres_same_schema --dbhost=star,line --filter="notrigger=slony noindexes"

       Example 4: Check differences for the database "battlestar" on different
       ports

         check_postgres_same_schema --dbname=battlestar --dbport=5432,5544

       Example 5: Create a daily and weekly snapshot file

         check_postgres_same_schema --dbname=cylon --suffix=daily
         check_postgres_same_schema --dbname=cylon --suffix=weekly

       Example 6: Run a historical comparison, then replace the file

         check_postgres_same_schema --dbname=cylon --suffix=daily --replace

       Example 7: Verify that two databases on hosts star and line are the
       same, excluding value data (i.e. sequence last_val):

         check_postgres_same_schema --dbhost=star,line --assume-async

   sequence
       ("symlink: check_postgres_sequence") Checks how much room is left on
       all sequences in the database.  This is measured as the percent of
       total possible values that have been used for each sequence.  The
       --warning and --critical options should be expressed as percentages.
       The default values are 85% for the warning and 95% for the critical.
       You may use --include and --exclude to control which sequences are to
       be checked. Note that this check does account for unusual minvalue and
       increment by values. By default it does not care if the sequence is set
       to cycle or not, and by passing --skipcycled sequenced set to cycle are
       reported with 0% usage.

       The output for Nagios gives the name of the sequence, the percentage
       used, and the number of 'calls' left, indicating how many more times
       nextval can be called on that sequence before running into the maximum
       value.

       The output for MRTG returns the highest percentage across all sequences
       on the first line, and the name of each sequence with that percentage
       on the fourth line, separated by a "|" (pipe) if there are more than
       one sequence at that percentage.

       Example 1: Give a warning if any sequences are approaching 95% full.

         check_postgres_sequence --dbport=5432 --warning=95%

       Example 2: Check that the sequence named "orders_id_seq" is not more
       than half full.

         check_postgres_sequence --dbport=5432 --critical=50% --include=orders_id_seq

   settings_checksum
       ("symlink: check_postgres_settings_checksum") Checks that all the
       Postgres settings are the same as last time you checked.  This is done
       by generating a checksum of a sorted list of setting names and their
       values. Note that different users in the same database may have
       different checksums, due to ALTER USER usage, and due to the fact that
       superusers see more settings than ordinary users. Either the --warning
       or the --critical option should be given, but not both. The value of
       each one is the checksum, a 32-character hexadecimal value. You can run
       with the special "--critical=0" option to find out an existing
       checksum.

       This action requires the Digest::MD5 module.

       Example 1: Find the initial checksum for the database on port 5555
       using the default user (usually postgres)

         check_postgres_settings_checksum --port=5555 --critical=0

       Example 2: Make sure no settings have changed and warn if so, using the
       checksum from above.

         check_postgres_settings_checksum --port=5555 --warning=cd2f3b5e129dc2b4f5c0f6d8d2e64231

       For MRTG output, returns a 1 or 0 indicating success of failure of the
       checksum to match. A checksum must be provided as the "--mrtg"
       argument. The fourth line always gives the current checksum.

   slony_status
       ("symlink: check_postgres_slony_status") Checks in the status of a
       Slony cluster by looking at the results of Slony's sl_status view. This
       is returned as the number of seconds of "lag time".  The --warning and
       --critical options should be expressed as times. The default values are
       60 seconds for the warning and 300 seconds for the critical.

       The optional argument --schema indicated the schema that Slony is
       installed under. If it is not given, the schema will be determined
       automatically each time this check is run.

       Example 1: Give a warning if any Slony is lagged by more than 20
       seconds

         check_postgres_slony_status --warning 20

       Example 2: Give a critical if Slony, installed under the schema
       "_slony", is over 10 minutes lagged

         check_postgres_slony_status --schema=_slony --critical=600

   timesync
       ("symlink: check_postgres_timesync") Compares the local system time
       with the time reported by one or more databases.  The --warning and
       --critical options represent the number of seconds between the two
       systems before an alert is given. If neither is specified, the default
       values are used, which are '2' and '5'. The warning value cannot be
       greater than the critical value. Due to the non-exact nature of this
       test, values of '0' or '1' are not recommended.

       The string returned shows the time difference as well as the time on
       each side written out.

       Example 1: Check that databases on hosts ankh, morpork, and klatch are
       no more than 3 seconds off from the local time:

         check_postgres_timesync --host=ankh,morpork,klatch --critical=3

       For MRTG output, returns one the first line the number of seconds
       difference between the local time and the database time. The fourth
       line returns the name of the database.

   txn_idle
       ("symlink: check_postgres_txn_idle") Checks the number and duration of
       "idle in transaction" queries on one or more databases. There is no
       need to run this more than once on the same database cluster. Databases
       can be filtered by using the --include and --exclude options. See the
       "BASIC FILTERING" section below for more details.

       The --warning and --critical options are given as units of time, signed
       integers, or integers for units of time, and at least one must be
       provided (there are no defaults). Valid units are 'seconds', 'minutes',
       'hours', or 'days'. Each may be written singular or abbreviated to just
       the first letter. If no units are given and the numbers are unsigned,
       the units are assumed to be seconds.

       This action requires Postgres 8.3 or better.

       As of PostgreSQL 10, you can just GRANT pg_read_all_stats to an
       unprivileged user account.  In all earlier versions, superuser
       privileges are required to see the queries of all users in the system;
       UNKNOWN is returned if queries cannot be checked. To only include
       queries by the connecting user, use --includeuser.

       Example 1: Give a warning if any connection has been idle in
       transaction for more than 15 seconds:

         check_postgres_txn_idle --port=5432 --warning='15 seconds'

       Example 2: Give a warning if there are 50 or more transactions

         check_postgres_txn_idle --port=5432 --warning='+50'

       Example 3: Give a critical if 5 or more connections have been idle in
       transaction for more than 10 seconds:

         check_postgres_txn_idle --port=5432 --critical='5 for 10 seconds'

       For MRTG output, returns the time in seconds the longest idle
       transaction has been running. The fourth line returns the name of the
       database and other information about the longest transaction.

   txn_time
       ("symlink: check_postgres_txn_time") Checks the length of open
       transactions on one or more databases.  There is no need to run this
       command more than once per database cluster.  Databases can be filtered
       by use of the --include and --exclude options. See the "BASIC
       FILTERING" section for more details. The owner of the transaction can
       also be filtered, by use of the --includeuser and --excludeuser
       options.  See the "USER NAME FILTERING" section for more details.

       The values or the --warning and --critical options are units of time,
       and at least one must be provided (no default). Valid units are
       'seconds', 'minutes', 'hours', or 'days'. Each may be written singular
       or abbreviated to just the first letter.  If no units are given, the
       units are assumed to be seconds.

       This action requires Postgres 8.3 or better.

       Example 1: Give a critical if any transaction has been open for more
       than 10 minutes:

         check_postgres_txn_time --port=5432 --critical='10 minutes'

       Example 1: Warn if user 'warehouse' has a transaction open over 30
       seconds

         check_postgres_txn_time --port-5432 --warning=30s --includeuser=warehouse

       For MRTG output, returns the maximum time in seconds a transaction has
       been open on the first line. The fourth line gives the name of the
       database.

   txn_wraparound
       ("symlink: check_postgres_txn_wraparound") Checks how close to
       transaction wraparound one or more databases are getting.  The
       --warning and --critical options indicate the number of transactions
       done, and must be a positive integer.  If either option is not given,
       the default values of 1.3 and 1.4 billion are used. There is no need to
       run this command more than once per database cluster. For a more
       detailed discussion of what this number represents and what to do about
       it, please visit the page
       <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/routine-vacuuming.html#VACUUM-FOR-WRAPAROUND>

       The warning and critical values can have underscores in the number for
       legibility, as Perl does.

       Example 1: Check the default values for the localhost database

         check_postgres_txn_wraparound --host=localhost

       Example 2: Check port 6000 and give a critical when 1.7 billion
       transactions are hit:

         check_postgres_txn_wraparound --port=6000 --critical=1_700_000_000

       For MRTG output, returns the highest number of transactions for all
       databases on line one, while line 4 indicates which database it is.

   version
       ("symlink: check_postgres_version") Checks that the required version of
       Postgres is running. The --warning and --critical options (only one is
       required) must be of the format X.Y or X.Y.Z where X is the major
       version number, Y is the minor version number, and Z is the revision.

       Example 1: Give a warning if the database on port 5678 is not version
       8.4.10:

         check_postgres_version --port=5678 -w=8.4.10

       Example 2: Give a warning if any databases on hosts valley,grain, or
       sunshine is not 8.3:

         check_postgres_version -H valley,grain,sunshine --critical=8.3

       For MRTG output, reports a 1 or a 0 indicating success or failure on
       the first line. The fourth line indicates the current version. The
       version must be provided via the "--mrtg" option.

   wal_files
       ("symlink: check_postgres_wal_files") Checks how many WAL files exist
       in the pg_xlog directory (PostgreSQL 10 and later" pg_wal), which is
       found off of your data_directory, sometimes as a symlink to another
       physical disk for performance reasons. If the --lsfunc option is not
       used then this action must be run as a superuser, in order to access
       the contents of the pg_xlog directory. The minimum version to use this
       action is Postgres 8.1. The --warning and --critical options are simply
       the number of files in the pg_xlog directory. What number to set this
       to will vary, but a general guideline is to put a number slightly
       higher than what is normally there, to catch problems early.

       Normally, WAL files are closed and then re-used, but a long-running
       open transaction, or a faulty archive_command script, may cause
       Postgres to create too many files. Ultimately, this will cause the disk
       they are on to run out of space, at which point Postgres will shut
       down.

       To avoid connecting as a database superuser, a wrapper function around
       pg_ls_dir() should be defined as a superuser with SECURITY DEFINER, and
       the --lsfunc option used. This example function, if defined by a
       superuser, will allow the script to connect as a normal user nagios
       with --lsfunc=ls_xlog_dir

         BEGIN;
         CREATE FUNCTION ls_xlog_dir()
             RETURNS SETOF TEXT
             AS $$ SELECT pg_ls_dir('pg_xlog') $$
             LANGUAGE SQL
             SECURITY DEFINER;
         REVOKE ALL ON FUNCTION ls_xlog_dir() FROM PUBLIC;
         GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION ls_xlog_dir() to nagios;
         COMMIT;

       Example 1: Check that the number of ready WAL files is 10 or less on
       host "pluto", using a wrapper function "ls_xlog_dir" to avoid the need
       for superuser permissions

         check_postgres_archive_ready --host=pluto --critical=10 --lsfunc=ls_xlog_dir

       For MRTG output, reports the number of WAL files on line 1.

   rebuild_symlinks
   rebuild_symlinks_force
       This action requires no other arguments, and does not connect to any
       databases, but simply creates symlinks in the current directory for
       each action, in the form check_postgres_<action_name>.  If the file
       already exists, it will not be overwritten. If the action is
       rebuild_symlinks_force, then symlinks will be overwritten. The option
       --symlinks is a shorter way of saying --action=rebuild_symlinks

BASIC FILTERING
       The options --include and --exclude can be combined to limit which
       things are checked, depending on the action. The name of the database
       can be filtered when using the following actions: backends,
       database_size, locks, query_time, txn_idle, and txn_time.  The name of
       a relation can be filtered when using the following actions: bloat,
       index_size, table_size, relation_size, last_vacuum, last_autovacuum,
       last_analyze, and last_autoanalyze.  The name of a setting can be
       filtered when using the settings_checksum action.  The name of a file
       system can be filtered when using the disk_space action.

       If only an include option is given, then ONLY those entries that match
       will be checked. However, if given both exclude and include, the
       exclusion is done first, and the inclusion after, to reinstate things
       that may have been excluded. Both --include and --exclude can be given
       multiple times, and/or as comma-separated lists. A leading tilde will
       match the following word as a regular expression.

       To match a schema, end the search term with a single period. Leading
       tildes can be used for schemas as well.

       Be careful when using filtering: an inclusion rule on the backends, for
       example, may report no problems not only because the matching database
       had no backends, but because you misspelled the name of the database!

       Examples:

       Only checks items named pg_class:

        --include=pg_class

       Only checks items containing the letters 'pg_':

        --include=~pg_

       Only check items beginning with 'pg_':

        --include=~^pg_

       Exclude the item named 'test':

        --exclude=test

       Exclude all items containing the letters 'test:

        --exclude=~test

       Exclude all items in the schema 'pg_catalog':

        --exclude='pg_catalog.'

       Exclude all items in the 'pg_temp_nnn' per-session temporary schemas:

        --exclude=~^pg_temp_.

       Exclude all items containing the letters 'ace', but allow the item
       'faceoff':

        --exclude=~ace --include=faceoff

       Exclude all items which start with the letters 'pg_', which contain the
       letters 'slon', or which are named 'sql_settings' or 'green'.
       Specifically check items with the letters 'prod' in their names, and
       always check the item named 'pg_relname':

        --exclude=~^pg_,~slon,sql_settings --exclude=green --include=~prod,pg_relname

USER NAME FILTERING
       The options --includeuser and --excludeuser can be used on some actions
       to only examine database objects owned by (or not owned by) one or more
       users.  An --includeuser option always trumps an --excludeuser option.
       You can give each option more than once for multiple users, or you can
       give a comma-separated list. The actions that currently use these
       options are:

       database_size
       last_analyze
       last_autoanalyze
       last_vacuum
       last_autovacuum
       query_time
       relation_size
       txn_time

       Examples:

       Only check items owned by the user named greg:

        --includeuser=greg

       Only check items owned by either watson or crick:

        --includeuser=watson,crick

       Only check items owned by crick,franklin, watson, or wilkins:

        --includeuser=watson --includeuser=franklin --includeuser=crick,wilkins

       Check all items except for those belonging to the user scott:

        --excludeuser=scott

TEST MODE
       To help in setting things up, this program can be run in a "test mode"
       by specifying the --test option. This will perform some basic tests to
       make sure that the databases can be contacted, and that certain per-
       action prerequisites are met, such as whether the user is a superuser,
       if the version of Postgres is new enough, and if stats_row_level is
       enabled.

FILES
       In addition to command-line configurations, you can put any options
       inside of a file. The file .check_postgresrc in the current directory
       will be used if found. If not found, then the file ~/.check_postgresrc
       will be used. Finally, the file /etc/check_postgresrc will be used if
       available.  The format of the file is option = value, one per line. Any
       line starting with a '#' will be skipped.  Any values loaded from a
       check_postgresrc file will be overwritten by command-line options. All
       check_postgresrc files can be ignored by supplying a
       "--no-checkpostgresrc" argument.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The environment variable $ENV{HOME} is used to look for a
       .check_postgresrc file.  The environment variable $ENV{PGBINDIR} is
       used to look for PostgreSQL binaries.

TIPS AND TRICKS
       Since this program uses the psql program, make sure it is accessible to
       the user running the script. If run as a cronjob, this often means
       modifying the PATH environment variable.

       If you are using Nagios in embedded Perl mode, use the "--action"
       argument instead of symlinks, so that the plugin only gets compiled one
       time.

DEPENDENCIES
       Access to a working version of psql, and the following very standard
       Perl modules:

       Cwd
       Getopt::Long
       File::Basename
       File::Temp
       Time::HiRes (if $opt{showtime} is set to true, which is the default)

       The "settings_checksum" action requires the Digest::MD5 module.

       The "checkpoint" action requires the Date::Parse module.

       Some actions require access to external programs. If psql is not
       explicitly specified, the command "which" is used to find it. The
       program "/bin/df" is needed by the "disk_space" action.

DEVELOPMENT
       Development happens using the git system. You can clone the latest
       version by doing:

        https://github.com/bucardo/check_postgres
        git clone https://github.com/bucardo/check_postgres.git

MAILING LIST
       Three mailing lists are available. For discussions about the program,
       bug reports, feature requests, and commit notices, send email to
       check_postgres@bucardo.org

       <https://mail.endcrypt.com/mailman/listinfo/check_postgres>

       A low-volume list for announcement of new versions and important
       notices is the 'check_postgres-announce' list:

       <https://mail.endcrypt.com/mailman/listinfo/check_postgres-announce>

       Source code changes (via git-commit) are sent to the
       'check_postgres-commit' list:
