IIC_GPIOMUX(4)         FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual         IIC_GPIOMUX(4)

NAME
     iic_gpiomux – driver for I2C mux hardware controlled via GPIO

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following line in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device iic_gpiomux

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           iic_gpiomux_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The iic_gpiomux driver supports any type of I2C bus multiplexer (mux)
     hardware that is controlled by manipulating the state of one or more GPIO
     pins.  It automatically connects an upstream I2C bus to one of the
     downstream buses as needed when slave devices on the downstream buses
     initiate I/O.  More information on the automatic switching behavior is
     available in iicmux(4).

FDT CONFIGURATION
     On an fdt(4) based system, an iic_gpiomux device node may be defined as a
     child node of any arbitrary bus in the FDT data.  The i2c-parent property
     indicates the connection to the upstream I2C bus.  The children of the
     iic_gpiomux node are additional i2c buses, which will have their own i2c
     slave devices described in their child nodes.

     The iic_gpiomux driver conforms to the standard i2c/i2c-mux-gpio.txt
     bindings document.
