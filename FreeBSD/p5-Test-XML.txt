NAME
       Test::XML - Compare XML in perl tests

SYNOPSIS
         use Test::XML tests => 3;
         is_xml( '<foo />', '<foo></foo>' );   # PASS
         is_xml( '<foo />', '<bar />' );       # FAIL
         isnt_xml( '<foo />', '<bar />' );     # PASS
         is_well_formed_xml('<foo/>');               # PASS
         is_well_formed_xml('<foo>');                # FAIL

DESCRIPTION
       This module contains generic XML testing tools.  See below for a list
       of other modules with functions relating to specific XML modules.

FUNCTIONS
       is_xml ( GOT, EXPECTED [, TESTNAME ] )
           This function compares GOT and EXPECTED, both of which are strings
           of XML.  The comparison works semantically and will ignore
           differences in syntax which are meaningless in xml, such as
           different quote characters for attributes, order of attributes or
           empty tag styles.

           Returns true or false, depending upon test success.

       isnt_xml( GOT, MUST_NOT_BE [, TESTNAME ] )
           This function is similiar to is_xml(), except that it will fail if
           GOT and MUST_NOT_BE are identical.

       is_well_formed_xml( XML [, TESTNAME ] )
           This function determines whether or not a given XML string is
           parseable as XML.

       is_good_xml ( XML [, TESTNAME ] )
           This is an alias for is_well_formed_xml().

NOTES
       There are several features of XML::SemanticDiff that may suprise you if
       you are not aware of them.  In particular:

       •   Leading and trailing whitespace is always stripped, even in
           elements with character content.

       •   Whitespace inside character content is always stripped down to a
           single space.

       •   In mixed content elements (ie: an element with both text and
           elements beneath it), all text is treated as a single value.

       •   The order of elements is ignored.
