UHSOCTL(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             UHSOCTL(1)

NAME
     uhsoctl – connection utility for Option based devices

SYNOPSIS
     uhsoctl [-a apn] [-c cid] [-p pin] [-u username] [-k password] [-r path]
             [-f path] [-b | -n] interface
     uhsoctl -d interface
     uhsoctl -h

DESCRIPTION
     uhsoctl is a small connection utility for Option N.V. devices that are
     based on Options packet interface and uses proprietary AT_* calls to
     establish connections.  The utility (tries to) configure both default
     route and name servers (/etc/resolv.conf).

     By default uhsoctl detaches from the terminal upon on a successful
     connection, a few command-line options exists that allows this behavior
     to be changed.

     uhsoctl attempts to find a usable controlling serial port based on the
     provided network interface.  If this fails you might specify a serial
     port manually.

OPTIONS
     -a apn
           Specify APN to connect to.

     -c cid
           Specify CID (Context ID) to use, by default CID 1 is used.  If an
           APN has been configured once, it's enough to specify the CID used
           for further accesses.

     -p pin
           Specify SIM PIN.

     -u username
           Specify username.

     -k password
           Specify username.

     -r path
           Path to resolv.conf, default /etc/resolv.conf.  Use /dev/null to
           disable updating of name servers.

     -f path
           Explicitly set the serial port to use as controlling terminal.
           Might be needed if the automatic detection fails.

     -b    Fork into background directly, before a connection has been
           established.

     -n    Never fork into background, run entirely in foreground.

EXAMPLES
     Connect to “apn.example.com” on interface “uhso0” and use PIN “1234” to
     enable the SIM card.
           uhsoctl -a apn.example.com -p 1234 uhso0

     Disconnect from a previously established connection.
           uhsoctl -d uhso0
