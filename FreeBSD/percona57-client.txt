COMP_ERR(1)                  MySQL Database System                 COMP_ERR(1)



NAME
       comp_err - compile MySQL error message file

SYNOPSIS
       comp_err [options]

DESCRIPTION
       comp_err creates the errmsg.sys file that is used by mysqld to
       determine the error messages to display for different error codes.
       comp_err normally is run automatically when MySQL is built. It compiles
       the errmsg.sys file from the text-format error information file located
       at sql/share/errmsg-utf8.txt in MySQL source distributions.

       comp_err also generates the mysqld_error.h, mysqld_ername.h, and
       sql_state.h header files.

       For more information about how error messages are defined, see the
       MySQL Internals Manual[1].

       Invoke comp_err like this:

           comp_err [options]
