DWARF_GET_CU_DIE_OFFSET(3)                    FreeBSD Library Functions Manual

NAME
     dwarf_get_arange_cu_header_offset, dwarf_get_cu_die_offset – retrieve
     compilation unit offsets

LIBRARY
     DWARF Access Library (libdwarf, -ldwarf)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <libdwarf.h>

     int
     dwarf_get_arange_cu_header_offset(Dwarf_Arange ar, Dwarf_Off *ret,
         Dwarf_Error *err);

     int
     dwarf_get_cu_die_offset(Dwarf_Arange ar, Dwarf_Off *ret,
         Dwarf_Error *err);

DESCRIPTION
     These functions retrieve the offsets, relative to the “.debug_info” DWARF
     section, of the debugging information entries describing the compilation
     unit associated with a Dwarf_Arange descriptor.

     Function dwarf_get_arange_cu_header_offset() retrieves the offset of the
     compilation unit header associated with argument ar, and stores it in the
     location pointed to by argument ret.

     Function dwarf_get_cu_die_offset() retrieves the offset of the debugging
     information entry for the compilation unit associated with argument ar,
     and stores it in the location pointed to by argument ret.

     If argument err is not NULL, these functions will use it to store error
     information, in case of an error.

RETURN VALUES
     On success, these functions returns DW_DLV_OK.  In case of an error, they
     return DW_DLV_ERROR and set the argument err.

ERRORS
     These functions may fail with:

     [DW_DLE_ARGUMENT]       Argument ar was not a valid Dwarf_Arange
                             descriptor.

     [DW_DLE_ARGUMENT]       Argument ret was NULL.
