IPFS(8)                 FreeBSD System Manager's Manual                IPFS(8)



NAME
       ipfs - saves and restores information for NAT and state tables.

SYNOPSIS
       ipfs [-nv] -l

       ipfs [-nv] -u

       ipfs [-nv] [ -d <dirname> ] -R

       ipfs [-nv] [ -d <dirname> ] -W

       ipfs [-nNSv] [ -f <filename> ] -r

       ipfs [-nNSv] [ -f <filename> ] -w

       ipfs [-nNSv] -f <filename> -i <if1>,<if2>

DESCRIPTION
       ipfs allows state information created for NAT entries and rules using
       keep state to be locked (modification prevented) and then saved to
       disk, allowing for the system to experience a reboot, followed by the
       restoration of that information, resulting in connections not being
       interrupted.

OPTIONS
       -d     Change the default directory used with -R and -W options for
              saving state information.

       -n     Don't actually take any action that would affect information
              stored in the kernel or on disk.

       -v     Provides a verbose description of what's being done.

       -i <ifname1>,<ifname2>
              Change all instances of interface name ifname1 in the state save
              file to ifname2.  Useful if you're restoring state information
              after a hardware reconfiguration or change.

       -N     Operate on NAT information.

       -S     Operate on filtering state information.

       -u     Unlock state tables in the kernel.

       -l     Lock state tables in the kernel.

       -r     Read information in from the specified file and load it into the
              kernel.  This requires the state tables to have already been
              locked and does not change the lock once complete.

       -w     Write information out to the specified file and from the kernel.
              This requires the state tables to have already been locked and
              does not change the lock once complete.

       -R     Restores all saved state information, if any, from two files,
              ipstate.ipf and ipnat.ipf, stored in the /var/db/ipf directory
              unless otherwise specified by the -d option.  The state tables
              are locked at the beginning of this operation and unlocked once
              complete.

       -W     Saves in-kernel state information, if any, out to two files,
              ipstate.ipf and ipnat.ipf, stored in the /var/db/ipf directory
              unless otherwise specified by the -d option.  The state tables
              are locked at the beginning of this operation and unlocked once
              complete.

FILES
       /var/db/ipf/ipstate.ipf
       /var/db/ipf/ipnat.ipf
       /dev/ipl
       /dev/ipstate
       /dev/ipnat

SEE ALSO
       ipf(8), ipl(4), ipmon(8), ipnat(8)

DIAGNOSTICS
       Perhaps the -W and -R operations should set the locking but rather than
       undo it, restore it to what it was previously.  Fragment table
       information is currently not saved.
