NAME
       sted - a small and simple text editor

SYNOPSIS
       sted [ -p ] [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
       sted means Simple (or Stupid, or Small) Text Editor.  It's a very
       simple text editor. It lets you load a file by specifying it on the
       command line, or by pressing F11, while in the program. Save by
       pressing F12 and quit by pressing F1.  You can move around with the
       cursor keys, and the PageUp, PageDown, Home and End keys. The -p
       parameter starts sted in psychedelic mode.

BUGS
       There are probably a lot of them. If there aren't any, it must be
       because the program is so very small and simple.
