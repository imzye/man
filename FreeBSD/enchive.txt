NAME
       enchive - personal archive encryption

SYNOPSIS
       enchive [-a|-A] [-e] [-p pubkey] [-s seckey] [--version] [--help]
               keygen [-d[N]] [-e] [-f] [-i] [-k N] [-u]
               archive [-d]
               extract [-d]
               fingerprint

DESCRIPTION
       enchive is a program to encrypt files to yourself for long-term
       archival.  It's a focused, simple alternative to more complex tools
       such as GnuPG or encrypted filesystems.  Like GnuPG, you can safely
       encrypt files on systems that you don't trust with your secret key.

       Files are secured with ChaCha20, Curve25519, and HMAC-SHA256.

OPTIONS
       -aseconds, --agent[=seconds]
              Runs the key agent for awhile after successfully reading the
              passphrase.  The agent will remain resident in memory until a
              period of inactivity passes.  Default is 900 seconds (15
              minutes).

       -A, --no-agent
              Do not start the key agent (default).

       -eprogram, --pinentry[=program]
              Read passphrases using the system's pinentry program.  By
              default Enchive uses the program named "pinentry".

       -p, --pubkey file
              Specifies the public key file to use for encryption.

       -s, --seckey file
              Specifies the secret key file to use for decryption.

       --version
              Print version information.

       --help Print a synopsis of the command line interface.

COMMANDS
       Any unique prefix for a command is accepted. For example, the command a
       would mean archive.

       keygen [OPTION]...
              Generates a new keypair either from system entropy or a
              passphrase.

           -d[N], --derive[=N]
                  Derives the secret key from a passphrase.  The key will be
                  derived from the passphrase using difficulty exponent N.
                  Default is 29.

           -e, --edit
                  Edits the protection passphrase on an existing key.  This
                  also regenerates the public key file from the secret key.

           -f, --force
                  Overwrites any existing keypair without prompting.

           -i, --fingerprint
                  Prints the public key fingerprint after generation or
                  editing.

           -k N, --iterations N
                  Sets the difficulty exponent for deriving the protection key
                  from the protection key passphrase.  Default is 25.

           -r N, --repeats N
                  Number of repeated passphrase prompts when deriving a secret
                  key.  It is convenient to set this to zero when relying
                  primarily on fingerprint verification.  Alternatively,
                  additional repeat prompts may aid in memorization.  Default
                  is 1.

           -u, --plain
                  Do not use a protection key, and instead store the secret
                  key unencrypted on the disk.  Consider using the key agent
                  instead of this option.

       archive [-d|--delete] [INPUT [OUTPUT]]
              Encrypts a single file for archival using only the public key.
              If no output filename is given, the output filename will be the
              input filename with a .enchive suffix.  Except for --delete, the
              original file is untouched.  If no filenames are given, encrypts
              standard input to standard output.

           -d, --delete
                  Delete the original input file after success.

       extract [-d|--delete] [INPUT [OUTPUT]]
              Decrypt a single file from archival using the secret key.  If no
              output filename is given, the output filename will be the input
              filename with the .enchive suffix removed.  Without an output
              filename, it is an error for the input to lack this suffix.  If
              no filenames are given, decrypt standard input to standard
              output.

           -d, --delete
                  Delete the original input file after success.

       fingerprint
              Print the public key fingerprint to standard output.

ENVIRONMENT
       TMPDIR If $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is unset, the directory in which to create
              the agent socket.  Default is /tmp.

       XDG_CONFIG_HOME
              The directory under which keys will be created and read.
              Default is $HOME/.config.

       XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
              The directory in which to create the agent socket.

FILES
       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/enchive/enchive.pub
              The file holding the public key used for encrypting files.

       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/enchive/enchive.sec
              The file holding the secret key used for decrypting files.

EXAMPLES
       enchive keygen --derive

       Generate a new keypair from a passphrase prompt.

       enchive archive -d mydata.tar.gz

       Encrypt mydata.tar.gz to mydata.tar.gz.enchive and delete the
       unencrypted file.

       enchive extract mydata.tar.gz.enchive

       Decrypt mydata.tar.gz.enchive to mydata.tar.gz, preserving the original
       file.
