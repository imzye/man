NAME
     rup – remote status display

SYNOPSIS
     rup [host ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The rup utility displays a summary of the current system status of a
     particular host or all hosts on the local network.  The output shows the
     current time of day, how long the system has been up, and the load
     averages.  The load average numbers give the number of jobs in the run
     queue averaged over 1, 5 and 15 minutes.

     The rpc.rstatd(8) daemon must be running on the remote host for this
     command to work.  The rup utility uses an RPC protocol defined in
     <rpcsvc/rstat.x>.

EXAMPLES
     example% rup otherhost
     otherhost   7:36am  up 6 days, 16:45,  load average: 0.20, 0.23, 0.18
     example%

DIAGNOSTICS
     rup: RPC: Program not registered  The rpc.rstatd(8) daemon has not been
     started on the remote host.

     rup: RPC: Timed out  A communication error occurred.  Either the network
     is excessively congested, or the rpc.rstatd(8) daemon has terminated on
     the remote host.

     rup: RPC: Port mapper failure - RPC: Timed out  The remote host is not
     running the portmapper (see rpcbind(8)), and cannot accommodate any RPC-
     based services.  The host may be down.

SEE ALSO
     rpc.rstatd(8), rpcbind(8)
