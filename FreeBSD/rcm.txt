LSRC(1)                 FreeBSD General Commands Manual                LSRC(1)

NAME
     lsrc – show dotfiles files managed by rcm

SYNOPSIS
     lsrc [-FhqVv] [-B hostname] [-d dir] [-I excl_pat] [-S excl_pat]
          [-s excl_pat] [-t tag] [-U excl_pat] [-u excl_pat] [-x excl_pat]
          [files ...]

DESCRIPTION
     This program lists all configuration files, both the sources in the
     dotfiles directories and the destinations in your home directory.  See
     rcup(1), the DIRECTORY LAYOUT section, for details on the directory
     layout.  It supports these options:

     -B HOSTNAME  treat host-HOSTNAME as the host-specific directory instead
                  of computing it based on the computer's hostname

     -d DIR       list dotfiles from the DIR. This can be specified multiple
                  times.

     -F           show symbols next to each file indicating status
                  information. Supported symbols are @ which indicates that
                  the file is a symlink, $ which indicates it's a symlinked
                  directory, and X to indicate that the file is a copy. More
                  details on copied files and symlinked directories can be
                  found in rcrc(5) under the documentation on COPY_ALWAYS and
                  SYMLINK_DIRS, respectively.

     -h           show usage instructions.

     -I excl_pat  include the files that match the given pattern. This is
                  applied after any -x options. It uses the same pattern
                  language as -x; more details are in the EXCLUDE PATTERN
                  section. Note that you may have to quote the exclude pattern
                  so the shell does not evaluate the glob.

     -S excl_pat  symlink the directories that match the given pattern. See
                  EXCLUDE PATTERN for more details. This option can be
                  repeated. You may need to quote the pattern to prevent the
                  shell from swallowing the glob.

     -s excl_pat  if a directory matches the given pattern, recur inside of it
                  instead of symlinking. See EXCLUDE PATTERN for more details.
                  This is the opposite of the -S option, and can be used to
                  undo it or the SYMLINK_DIRS setting in your rcrc(5)
                  configuration. It can be repeated, and the pattern may need
                  to be quoted to protect it from your shell.

     -t TAG       list dotfiles according to TAG

     -U excl_pat  the rc files or directories matching this pattern will not
                  be symlinked or created with a leading dot. See EXCLUDE
                  PATTERN for more details. This option can be repeated. You
                  may need to quote the pattern to prevent the shell from
                  swallowing the glob.

     -u excl_pat  if an rc file or directory matches the given pattern, it
                  must be dotted. See EXCLUDE PATTERN for more details. This
                  is the opposite of the -U option, and can be used to undo it
                  or the UNDOTTED setting in your rcrc(5) configuration. This
                  option can be repeated. You may need to quote the pattern to
                  prevent the shell from swallowing the glob.

     -V           show the version number.

     -v           increase verbosity. This can be repeated for extra
                  verbosity.

     -q           decrease verbosity

     -x excl_pat  exclude the files that match the given pattern. See EXCLUDE
                  PATTERN for more details. This option can be repeated. Quote
                  the pattern if it contains a valid shell glob.

     files ...    only list the specified file(s)

EXCLUDE PATTERN
     The exclude pattern specifies a colon-separated pair of dotfiles
     directory and file glob. The dotfiles directory is optional and, if
     omitted, defaults to *, which is a special token that matches any
     dotfiles directory. The file glob is relative to the dotfiles directory,
     ignoring meta directories. A colon combines them.

     For example, to ignore all emacs-related items from the
     thoughtbot-dotfiles directory, use the exclude pattern:

           thoughtbot-dotfiles:*emacs*

     To ignore any bash_profile file, use the pattern:

           *:bash_profile

     Or more simply:

           bash_profile

     Since exclude patterns are often valid shell globs, be sure to quote
     them. See the caveats noted in BUGS when using an exclude pattern.

BUGS
     For macOS systems, we strongly encourage the use of the HOSTNAME variable
     in your rcrc(5).  We use the hostname(1) program to determine the unique
     identifier for the host. This program is not specified by POSIX and can
     vary by system. On macOS the hostname is unpredictable, and can even
     change as part of the DHCP handshake.
