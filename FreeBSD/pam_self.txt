PAM_SELF(8)             FreeBSD System Manager's Manual            PAM_SELF(8)

NAME
     pam_self – Self PAM module

SYNOPSIS
     [service-name] module-type control-flag pam_self [options]

DESCRIPTION
     The Self authentication service module for PAM, pam_self provides
     functionality for only one PAM category: authentication.  In terms of the
     module-type parameter, this is the “auth” feature.

   Self Authentication Module
     The Self authentication component (pam_sm_authenticate()), returns
     success if and only if the target user's user ID is identical with the
     current real user ID.  If the current real user ID is zero,
     authentication will fail, unless the allow_root option was specified.

     The following options may be passed to the authentication module:

     debug           syslog(3) debugging information at LOG_DEBUG level.

     no_warn         suppress warning messages to the user.  These messages
                     include reasons why the user's authentication attempt was
                     declined.

     allow_root      do not automatically fail if the current real user ID is
                     0.
