Gtk2::PathButtonBar(3)                     User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Gtk2::PathButtonBar - Creates a bar for path manipulation.

VERSION
       Version 0.1.2

SYNOPSIS
       This creates a collection of buttons and a entry widget to help with
       browsing a path or etc.

       It is composed of two lines. The first line contains a set of buttons.
       The first button is a button that blanks the current path. This is the
       'goRoot' button and displays what ever the user has decided the root is
       by setting the 'root' key when invoking the new funtions.  The buttons
       after that are ones that correspond to a chunk of the path, broken up
       by what ever the delimiter is set to. When any of these are pressed,
       the entry text is changed as well to relfect it. The 'goRoot' button
       clears the path to ''.

       The second line starts with a label. The label is the same as on the
       'goRoot' button and is what ever the root is set as. After that there
       is a single line text entry widget. This allows the path to be set by
       typing it in. After the text entry widget, there is a button labeled
       'Go'.  When this button is pressed, it updates the button bar with what
       is in text entry widget.

       Any time the path is updated, '$self->{exec}' is ran through eval.

           use Gtk2;
           use Gtk2::PathButtonBar;

           Gtk2->init;

           my $window = Gtk2::Window->new();

           my $pbb=Gtk2::PathButtonBar->new({exec=>'print "path=".${$myself}->{path}."\na=".${$myself}->{vars}{a}."\n";',
                                           vars=>{a=>1},
                                           });

           print $pbb->{vbox}."\n";

           $window->add($pbb->{vbox});

           $window->show;

FUNCTIONS
   new
       This initiates this widget. This takes it's arguements in the form of a
       hash.  The accepted keys can be found below.

       delimiter

       This is what will be considered a delimiter between directories or
       whatever. The default is '/'.

       exec

       This is a string that will be executed any time any change is done.
       Change the text in the string entry box does not constitute a change
       till the 'Go' button is pressed.

       For example, setting it to the following, would cause it to print the
       current path followed a new line and then a 'a=' what ever
       '$self->{vars}{a}' is set to.

           exec=>'print "path=".${$myself}->{path}."\na=".${$myself}->{vars}{a}."\n:;

       If you wish to pass any sort of variables to this, it is strongly
       suggested you do it by using the 'vars' key in the hash passed to the
       new function.

       Upon a failure to execute the code in exec, it will issue a warning.

       root

       This is what will be displayed as being the root. This wills how up in
       the 'goRoot' button and in the label before the entry box.

       If it is not defined, it defaults to what ever the delimiter is. If the
       delimiter is not set, that means this will display '/', which works
       nicely for most unix FS stuff.

       path

       This is the path that the it will originally be set to.

       vars

       This is meant to contain variables that will be used with
       '$self->{exec}'.

   go
       This is called when a new path is set by pressing the go button.

       There is no reason to ever call this from '$self->{exec}'.

   goRoot
       This is called when a new path is set by pressing the root button.

       If you wish to call this from '$self->{exec}', do it as below.

           ${$myself}->goRoot;

   makeButtons
       This is a internal function that rebuilds the button bar.

       If you wish to call this from '$self->{exec}', do it as below.

           ${$myself}->makeButtons;

   setPath
       This changes the current path.

       One arguement is accepted and that is the path.

           $pbb->setPath($somepath);
           if($self->{error}){
               print "Error!\n";
           }

   errorblank
       This blanks the error storage and is only meant for internal usage.

       It does the following.

           $self->{error}=undef;
           $self->{errorString}="";

ERROR CODES
   1
       No path specified.
