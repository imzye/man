NAME
       File::Policy - Site policy for file I/O functions

SYNOPSIS
               use File::Policy;
               use File::Policy qw/check_safe/;   # to import a specific subroutine
               use File::Policy qw/:all/;         # to import all subroutines

               #Checking I/O policy
               check_safe($filename, 'r');
               check_safe($filename, 'w');

               #Preferred directory locations
               $logdir = get_log_dir();
               $tmpdir = get_temp_dir();

DESCRIPTION
       This defines the policy for file I/O with modules such as
       File::Slurp::WithinPolicy.  The purpose is to allow systems
       administrators to define locations and restrictions for applications'
       file I/O and give app developers a policy to follow.  Note that the
       module doesn't ENFORCE the policy - application developers can choose
       to ignore it (and systems administrators can choose not to install
       their applications if they do!).

       You may control which policy gets applied by creating a
       File::Policy::Config module with an IMPLEMENTATION constant. You may
       write your own policy as a module within the File::Policy:: namespace.

       By default (if no File::Policy::Config is present), the
       File::Policy::Default policy gets applied which doesn't impose any
       restrictions and provides reasonable default locations for temporary
       and log files.

       The motivation behind this module was a standard, flexible approach to
       allow a site wide file policy to be defined.  This will be most useful
       in large environments where a few sysadmins are responsible for code
       written by many other people.  Simply ensuring that submitted code
       calls check_safe() ensures file access is sane, reducing the amount of
       effort required to do a security audit.

       If your code is not security audit'd, or you are the only developer at
       your site, this might be overkill. However you may consider it good
       practise regardless and protection against paths in your code getting
       corrupted accidently or maliciously in the future.

       There are two major benefits of using this module.  One, sites that do
       implement a policy can more easily integrate your code in a standard
       way.  If you have a file policy at your site, you can apply different
       policies (via File::Policy::Config) in different environments
       (production, integration test, development) and the appropriate policy
       is automatically applied without having to change your code or configs.

FUNCTIONS
       check_safe
                   check_safe( FILENAME , MODE );

           Checks FILENAME is safe - dies if not.  MODE is r (read) or w
           (write).

       get_temp_dir
                   $temporary_directory = get_temp_dir();

           Returns the path to temporary directory.  Note that any return
           value will have been cleared of a trailing slash.

       get_log_dir
                   $log_directory = get_log_dir();

           Returns the path to log directory.  Note that any return value will
           have been cleared of a trailing slash.

DEFINING YOUR OWN POLICY
       To implement your own custom policy

         cp File/Policy/Default.pm File/Policy/YourPolicy.pm

       and modify YourPolicy accordingly.  Then, create File/Policy/Config.pm
       contaning:

         use constant IMPLEMENTATION => 'YourPolicy';

       Now having used File::Policy, calling check_safe in your scripts will
       enforce your policy (as well as give you access to log and temp paths
       in locations you recommend).
