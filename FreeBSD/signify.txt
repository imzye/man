SIGNIFY(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             SIGNIFY(1)

NAME
     signify – cryptographically sign and verify files

SYNOPSIS
     signify -C [-q] [-p pubkey] [-t keytype] -x sigfile [file ...]
     signify -G [-n] [-c comment] -p pubkey -s seckey
     signify -S [-enz] [-x sigfile] -s seckey -m message
     signify -V [-eqz] [-p pubkey] [-t keytype] [-x sigfile] -m message

DESCRIPTION
     The signify utility creates and verifies cryptographic signatures.  A
     signature verifies the integrity of a message.  The mode of operation is
     selected with the following options:

     -C          Verify a signed checksum list, and then verify the checksum
                 for each file.  If no files are specified, all of them are
                 checked.  sigfile should be the signed output of sha256(1).

     -G          Generate a new key pair.  Keynames should follow the
                 convention of keyname.pub and keyname.sec for the public and
                 secret keys, respectively.

     -S          Sign the specified message file and create a signature.

     -V          Verify the message and signature match.

     The other options are as follows:

     -c comment    Specify the comment to be added during key generation.

     -e            When signing, embed the message after the signature.  When
                   verifying, extract the message from the signature.  (This
                   requires that the signature was created using -e and
                   creates a new message file as output.)

     -m message    When signing, the file containing the message to sign.
                   When verifying, the file containing the message to verify.
                   When verifying with -e, the file to create.

     -n            When generating a key pair, do not ask for a passphrase.
                   Otherwise, signify will prompt the user for a passphrase to
                   protect the secret key.  When signing with -z, store a zero
                   time stamp in the gzip(1) header.

     -p pubkey     Public key produced by -G, and used by -V to check a
                   signature.

     -q            Quiet mode.  Suppress informational output.

     -s seckey     Secret (private) key produced by -G, and used by -S to sign
                   a message.

     -t keytype    When deducing the correct key to check a signature, make
                   sure the actual key matches
                   /usr/local/etc/signify/*-keytype.pub.

     -x sigfile    The signature file to create or verify.  The default is
                   message.sig.

     -z            Sign and verify gzip(1) archives, where the signing data is
                   embedded in the gzip(1) header.

     The key and signature files created by signify have the same format.  The
     first line of the file is a free form text comment that may be edited, so
     long as it does not exceed a single line.  Signature comments will be
     generated based on the name of the secret key used for signing.  This
     comment can then be used as a hint for the name of the public key when
     verifying.  The second line of the file is the actual key or signature
     base64 encoded.

EXIT STATUS
     The signify utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.  It
     may fail because of one of the following reasons:

     •   Some necessary files do not exist.
     •   Entered passphrase is incorrect.
     •   The message file was corrupted and its signature does not match.
     •   The message file is too large.

EXAMPLES
     Create a new key pair:
           $ signify -G -p newkey.pub -s newkey.sec

     Sign a file, specifying a signature name:
           $ signify -S -s key.sec -m message.txt -x msg.sig

     Verify a signature, using the default signature name:
           $ signify -V -p key.pub -m generalsorders.txt

     Verify a release directory containing SHA256.sig and a full set of
     release files:
           $ signify -C -p /usr/local/etc/signify/openbsd-78-base.pub -x SHA256.sig

     Verify a bsd.rd before an upgrade:
           $ signify -C -p /usr/local/etc/signify/openbsd-78-base.pub -x SHA256.sig bsd.rd

     Sign a gzip archive:
           $ signify -Sz -s key-arc.sec -m in.tgz -x out.tgz

     Verify a gzip pipeline:
           $ ftp url | signify -Vz -t arc | tar ztf -
