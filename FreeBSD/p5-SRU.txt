NAME
       Catalyst::Controller::SRU - Dispatch SRU methods with Catalyst

SYNOPSIS
           package MyApp::Controller::SRU;

           # use it as a base controller
           use base qw( Catalyst::Controller::SRU );

           # explain, scan and searchretrieve methods
           sub explain {
               my ( $self, $c,
                   $sru_request,  # ISA SRU::Request::Explain
                   $sru_response, # ISA SRU::Response::Explain
               ) = @_;
           }

           sub scan {
               my ( $self, $c,
                   $sru_request,  # ISA SRU::Request::Scan
                   $sru_response, # ISA SRU::Response::Scan
                   $cql,          # ISA CQL::Parser root node
               ) = @_;

           }

           sub searchRetrieve {
               my ( $self, $c,
                   $sru_request,  # ISA SRU::Request::SearchRetrieve
                   $sru_response, # ISA SRU::Response::SearchRetrieve
                   $cql,          # ISA CQL::Parser root node
               ) = @_;
           }

DESCRIPTION
       This module allows your controller class to dispatch SRU actions
       ("explain", "scan", and "searchRetrieve") from its own class.

METHODS
   index : Private
       This method will create an SRU request, response and possibly a CQL
       object based on the type of SRU request it finds. It will then pass the
       data over to your customized method.
