Data::Page::NoTotalEntries(3)              User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Data::Page::NoTotalEntries - help when paging through sets of results
       without total entries

SYNOPSIS
         use Data::Page::NoTotalEntries;

DESCRIPTION
       Data::Page::NoTotalEntries is a generic pager object, so it's very
       similar with Data::Page.  But so Data::Page::NoTotalEntries doesn't
       support "$pager->total_entries" and other some methods.

       In sometime, I don't want to count total entries, because counting
       total entries from database are very slow.

METHODS
       my $pager = Data::Page::NoTotalEntries->new(%args);
           Create new instance of Data::Page::NoTotalEntries.  You can
           initialize attributes at constructor with %args.

       $pager->next_page()
           This method returns the next page number, if one exists. Otherwise
           it returns undefined:

               if ($page->next_page) {
                   print "Next page number: ", $page->next_page, "\n";
               }

       $pager->previous_page()
           This method returns the previous page number, if one exists.
           Otherwise it returns undefined:

               if ($page->previous_page) {
                   print "Previous page number: ", $page->previous_page, "\n";
               }

       $pager->prev_page()
           This is a alias for "$pager->previous_page()"

       $pager->first()
           This method returns the number of the first entry on the current
           page.

       $pager->last()
           This method returns the number of the last entry on the current
           page.

ATTRIBUTES
       has_next: Bool
           Does this page has a next page?

       entries_per_page: Int
           The number of entries in each page.

       current_page : Int
           This attribute is the current page number:

       entries_on_this_page: Int
           This attribute is the number of entries on the current page
