DESCRIPTION
       This module provides routines to format dates.  They correspond to the
       libc routines.  &strftime() supports a pretty good set of coversions --
       more than most C libraries.

       strftime supports a pretty good set of conversions.

       The POSIX module has very similar functionality.  You should consider
       using it instead if you do not have allergic reactions to system
       libraries.
