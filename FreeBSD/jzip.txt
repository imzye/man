JZIP(1)                John´s Z-code Interpreter Program               JZIP(1)

NAME
       jzip - execute Infocom v1-5 and Inform v1-8 game files

SYNOPSIS
       jzip [ options ] z-file-name

DESCRIPTION
       jzip invokes the Z-code Interpreter.

       See the Makefile contained in the source distribution to compile jzip.
       Machine specific options are listed at the beginning.

REQUIREMENTS
       jzip will run under most (if not all) flavors of Unix, including AIX,
       Solaris, SunOS, HP/UX, Linux, Free/NetBSD, IRIX, NeXT Mach, DEC OSF/1,
       and others.

INSTALLATION
       To install jzip, edit the Makefile with the options appropriate for
       your system, then issue the command make.

       It is probably a good idea to install the jzip executable in
       /usr/local/bin, and the man page in /usr/local/man/man1.

EDITING
       John Menichelli(menichel@pixi.com) has graced us with editing code.
       JZip now supports arrowkey editing in UNIX.

       Up/Down
              selects the previous / next command in history

       Left/Right
              moves the cursor over the line.

       Backspace
              deletes

       Typing inserts under the cursor

OPTIONS
       -l n   lines in display

       -c n   columns in display

       -r n   text right margin (default = 0)

       -t n   text top margin (default = 0)

       -v     display version information

ENVIRONMENT
       jzip looks for the environment variable INFOCOM_PATH and will use the
       path found there to look for the story file specified on the command
       line if the story file cannot be found in the current directory.  Set
       INFOCOM_PATH with setenv.

CREDITS
       jzip is written and maintained by John Holder (jholder@nmsu.edu), based
       on the ZIP v2.0 sources by Mark Howell and Olaf 'Olsen' Barthel.

       Mark Phillips and Andrew S. Benham contributed portability and bug
       fixes of various sorts.  This manpage was originally written by Michael
       S. Phillips.

BUGS
       Control characters are still passed to the interpreter (for now).

TODO
       Keystrokes to handle editing/reptition of previous commands

       DJGPP compiles for DOS.  (Note: There is a DOS version, just not a
       DJGPP DOS version.)

       Handling of CTRL characters under Unix
