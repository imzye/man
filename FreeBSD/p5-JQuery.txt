NAME
       JQuery - Interface to Jquery, a language based on Javascript

VERSION
       Version 1.00

SYNOPSIS
       JQuery provides some of the functionality provided by the JQuery
       language.

           use JQuery;

           my $jquery = new JQuery(jqueryDir => '/jquery_js') ;

           my $accordion = JQuery::Accordion->new(id => 'myAccordion',
                                                  headers => \@headers,
                                                  texts => \@texts,
                                                  panelHeight => 200,
                                                  panelWidth => '400px'
                                                  ) ;

           $jquery->add_css_last(new JQuery::CSS( hash => {'#myAccordion' => {width => '600px'}})) ;

           my $data = [['Id','Total','Ip','Time','US Short Date','US Long Date'],
                       ['66672',  '$22.79','172.78.200.124','08:02','12-24-2000','Jul 6, 2006 8:14 AM'],
                       ['66672','$2482.79','172.78.200.124','15:10','12-12-2001','Jan 6, 2006 8:14 AM']
                      ] ;

           my $tableHTML = $jquery->Add(JQuery::TableSorter->new(id => 'table1',
                                                                 data => $data,
                                                                 headerClass => 'largeHeaders',
                                                                 dateFormat=>'dd/mm/yyyy' ))->HTML ;

           $jquery->add($accordion) ;
           my $html = $accordion->HTML . $tableHTML ;
           my $jquery_code = $jquery->get_jquery_code ;
           my $css = $jquery->get_css ;

DESCRIPTION
       JQuery is a frontend for the jQuery language.  I use JQuery to refer to
       the Perl part or the package, and jQuery to reference the javascript
       part or the package.

       A quote from <http://jquery.com>: jQuery is a fast, concise, JavaScript
       Library that simplifies how you traverse HTML documents, handle events,
       perform animations, and add Ajax interactions to your web pages.

       JQuery.pm is the main module. There are other modules such as Form,
       TableSorter, Splitter, Taconite ..., all of which provide different
       functionality. The main module needs to be instantiated, and each
       instance of the other modules needs to be registered with the main
       module.  It is then the responsibility of JQuery.pm to produce the
       relevant HTML, css and javascript code.

       One of the objectives is to produce javascript functioniality with as
       little user code as possible and to provide reasonable defaults.
       "Reasonable" is of course in the sight of the beholder. Most defaults
       are provided by css, and can be changed easily.

       Another objective is to allow module writers to be able to add new
       functionality within this framework.

   Using JQuery
       JQuery comes packaged with jQuery javascript files.  Since the
       javascript directory is going to be needed by the web server, you will
       probably need to copy the whole of the jquery_js directory to somewhere
       the web server can access. Remember to change the web server config
       file if necessary.

   JQuery::CSS
       JQuery::CSS is a helper module that helps create CSS objects uses CSS
       module from CPAN.

       CSS can be created in the following ways:

          my $css = new JQuery::CSS(text => 'body {font-family: Arial, Sans-Serif;font-size: 10px;}') ;

          my $css = new JQuery::CSS( hash => {
                                           '.odd' => {'background-color' => "#FFF"} ,
                                           '.even' => {'background-color' => "#D7FF00"} ,
                                            }) ;

          my $css = new JQuery::CSS(file => 'dates/default.css') ;

       text    The "text" form allows plain text to be used to create the CSS
               object.

       hash    The "hash" form allows a Perl hash to be used.

       file    The "file" form allows a file to be specified.

   Initialization
       JQuery needs to be initialized.

           my $jquery = new JQuery(jqueryDir => '/jquery_js', usePacked => 1) ;

       The parameter jqueryDir specifies where the javascript files can be
       found.  When using a web server, this refers to the directory defined
       by the web server.

       If usePacked is set, the compressed jQuery files are used if available.

   Adding CSS
           CSS objects can be added to JQuery using
               $jquery->add_css($css)
           or
               $jquery->add_css_last($css)

           add_css outputs css before the css of the modules.  add_css_last
           outputs css after the css of the modules. This is useful if you
           want to change the default css supplied by the package.

   Functions
       add This adds a new object from JQuery::* to JQuery. Typically, this is
           used in a class implementing new functionality, and adds the new
           class to the controlling JQuery class. It is not normally called
           directly by the user.

       add_css
           Add css to JQuery. All css elements added are installed before that
           of css implemented by JQuery::*. This is used if the user wants to
           install CSS.

       add_css_last
           Similar to add_css, but the css gets added after the ccs
           implemented by JQuery::*. This means that the css installed by
           JQuery::* can be over-ridden by the user. Typically this would be
           used when changing colours, urls, backgrounds etc.

       getJQueryDir
           All JQuery::* objects get passed the a variable pointing to JQuery.
           Within JQuery::*, there may be a need to reference a path, eg an
           image, and the base path can be modified by using this directory.

           This parameter is the jqueryDir passed by

               my $jquery = new JQuery(jqueryDir => '/jquery_js') ;

       get_css
           This is normally called very late in the program when you want to
           produce all the css. It goes though all css registered with JQuery,
           then it gets all css registered by JQuery::* objects, and then it
           gets the css added add_css_last.

       get_jquery_code
           Similar to get_css, except that it produces the javascript to be
           included in the page.

       new Used to instantiate the JQuery object. The path is the path seen by
           the web browser, and not the local path.

               my $jquery = new JQuery(jqueryDir => '/jquery_js') ;

       usePacked
           JQuery modules can come in an unpacked or packed form. The former
           is the original source, while the second, although not compiled, is
           highly dense and obfuscated, while being more efficient.

JQuery::Examples
       There are a number of working examples in the cgi-bin directory, which
       can be found in the Perl distribution under the JQuery directory. The
       examples are mostly written using CGI::Application , so you will need
       to install CGI-Application to run the examples. This is not a
       restriction, as the modules will work using CGI and mod-apache as well,
       and hopefully the framework of yor choice.

   Demo.pm
       The examples mostly use Demo.pm. This is a very simple module which
       initializes JQuery, calls get_jquery_code, get_css

       The module Demo.pm simply does some of the repetitive work.

       The setupfunction initiates $jquery.  cgiapp_postrun gets runs
       $jquery->get_jquery_code, $jquery->get_css and puts both of these, and
       the HTML, into a very basic template.

   Ajax
       Let's start with the Ajax.

       Suppose you have a button, not neccessarily in a form, and you want
       some action to happen when the user presses the button.

       Firstly, the JQuery module needs to be initialized.

         use JQuery ;
         use JQuery::Taconite ;
         my $jquery = new JQuery(jqueryDir => '/jquery_js') ;

       The button to be pressed needs an id, as it is going to accessed by
       javascript. So the HTML fragment could read:

         <input id="ex1" type="button" value="Run Example 1" />

         JQuery::Taconite->new(id => 'ex1', remoteProgram => '/cgi-bin/jquery_taconite_results.pl', rm => 'myRunMode', addToJQuery => $jquery) ;

       You may or may not need to set the run mode. CGI-Applications normally
       need them, to define which function is to be executed in the CGI
       program.

       When the button is pressed, some output will be shown, and a
       placeholder is needed to display the text.

       The HTML fragment might be:

           <div id="example4" style="display:none; background-color: #ffa; padding:10px; border:1px solid #ccc">
           Initially this div is hidden.
           </div>

       This is a div where, initially, the text is not shown.

Example Programs
       jquery_accordion.pl
           Shows an example of an accordion

       jquery_clickmenu.pl
           An example of a menu in a normal desktop application

           Shows an example of an accordion

       jquery_form.pl
           This is a small example showing how a from is constructed, and how
           the Ajax reply is sent, causing only the specified fields to be
           updated.

       jquery_splitter1.pl, jquery_splitter2.pl, jquery_splitter3.pl
           Examples showing how to split an area into two or three panes with
           a bar allowing the user to resize them.

       jquery_tabs1.pl jquery_tabs2.pl jquery_tabs_results.pl
           Examples showing a tabbing of a pane. When the tab is pressed a
           different page is shown. The user can download the page remotely
           from a server.

       jquery_taconite1.pl and jquery_taconite_results1.pl jquery_taconite2.pl
           Taconite is a word that doesn't sound very interesting, but this
           module allows you update your screen very easily without needing to
           know anything about the DOM. This is Ajax at its easiest. You
           really want to use this.

           jquery_taconite1.pl sets up the page and
           jquery_taconite_results1.pl does the reply. This example show a
           variety of things to do with Taconite, by adding radio buttons,
           wiring a button on the fly, adding and removing items.

       jquery_taconite2.pl
           jquery_taconite2.pl does the same sort of thing as
           jquery_taconite1.pl, except that it uses a run mode to define the
           reply.

           Examples of split windows with a bar for resizing

       jquery_treeview.pl
           Show an expandable tree. You can choose grid lines or folder icons.

       jquery_heartbeat.pl
           Show how to update a page every second.

WRITING NEW MODULES
       A module needs to provide the following methods

       new - to create the object

       id - the id of the object. There are some modules that don't need this.
       This only happens in the case of where an instance does not have any
       css related to the id.

       get_css - returns the css for the instance. The return value may be an
       array reference. css may be plain text or a JQuery:CSS object.

       HTML - returns the HTML text for the instance

       packages_needed - returns a list of jquery packages needed for the
       javascript to run

       get_jquery_code - returns the jQuery code
