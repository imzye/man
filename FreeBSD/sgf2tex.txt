sgf2tex(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             sgf2tex(1)

NAME
       sgf2tex

SYNOPSIS
       sgf2tex -help|sgf2tex -h

       sgf2tex [ <options> ] <filename>[.sgf|.mgt]


DESCRIPTION
       sgf2tex takes a Smart Go Format file <filename> or <filename>.sgf or
       <filename>.mgt and produces a TeX file <filename>.tex.  Provided you
       have the GOOE fonts correctly installed on your system you will be able
       to TeX this producing a .dvi file.

OPTIONS
       -h
       -help

              Print a help message and quit.


       -i     <filename> | <filename>.sgf | <filename>.mgt

       -in    <filename> | <filename>.sgf | <filename>.mgt


              specifies the input filename. (STDIN or none for standard
              input.)  This option is not needed in ordinary use.


       -o     <filename>

       -out   <filename>

              Specifies the output file. (STDOUT for standard output.) If the
              input file is <filename>, <filename>.sgf or <filename>.mgt then
              <filename>.tex is the default. This option is not needed in
              ordinary usage.


       -t     <top line number>

       -top   <top line number>

              Specifies the top line to print. Default is 1.


       -b     <bottom line number>

       -bottom
              <bottom line number>

              Specifies the bottom line to print. Default is 19.


       -l     <left line number>

       -left  <top line number>

              Specifies the leftmost line to print. Default is 1.


       -r     <right line number>

       -right <right line number>

              Specifies the rightmost line to print. Default is 19.


       -break <break list>

       -breakList
              <break list>

              Here <break list> is a list of moves, separated by comma, with
              no spaces. These are breakpoints: each will be the last move in
              one diagram.


       -m     <moves per diagram>

       -movesPerDiagram
              <moves per diagram>

              Here <moves per diagram> is a positive integer, specifying the
              maximal number of moves per diagram. Default is 50 unless -break
              or -breakList is set, in which case the default is infinity. The
              two options -breakList and -movesPerDiagram may be used
              together.


       -n     | -newNumbers

              Begin each diagram with the number 1. The actual move numbers
              are still used in the label.  -newNumbers and -doubleDigits are
              alternative schemes for avoiding three-digit numbers in the
              diagrams. They should probably not be used together.


       -d     | -doubleDigits      If the first move of a diagram exceeds 100,
              the move number is reduced modulo 100. The actual move numbers
              are still used in the label.  -newNumbers and -doubleDigits are
              alternative schemes for avoiding three-digit numbers in the
              diagrams. They should probably not be used together.


       -rl    | -repeatLast

              The last move in each diagram is the first move in the next.
              This emulates a common style for annotating Go games.


       -il    | -ignoreLetters

              Letters embedded in the sgf with the L or LB property are
              ignored.


       -im    | -ignoreMarks

              Marks embedded in the sgf with the M or MA property are ignored.


       -ip    | -ignorePass

              Passes are ignored. In sgf, a pass is a move at the fictitious
              point tt. Without this option, sgf2tex will indicate passes in
              the comments.


       -ia    | -ignoreall

              Ignore SGF letters, marks, variations and passes.


       -firstDiagram
              <diagram number>

              Specifies the first diagram to print. Default is 1.


       -lastDiagram
              <diagram number>

              Specifies the last diagram to print. Default is to print all
              diagrams until the end.


       -longComments

              In its default usage, the comments to each diagram comprise an
              unbreakable vbox---they must all appear on one page. This can
              cause problems if the comments are very extensive. This option
              generates more complicated TeX macros which allow the comments
              to be broken across pages. This option may not be used with
              -simple or -longComments.


       -simple

              This generates very simple TeX which may not look so good on the
              page, but is convenient if you intend to edit the TeX. This
              option should not be used with -longComments.


       -twoColumn

              This generates a two-column format using smaller fonts. This
              option may not be used with -longComments or -coords.


       -coords

              Generates a coordinate grid. This option may not be used with
              -twoColumn


       -bigFonts

              Use fonts magnified 1.2 times.


       -texComments

              If this option is NOT used then {, } and \ are replaced by [, ]
              and / in comments, since TeX roman fonts do not have these
              characters. If this option is used, these substitutions are not
              made, so you can {\bf change fonts} inside the comments.
