SBP_TARG(4)            FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual            SBP_TARG(4)

NAME
     sbp_targ – Serial Bus Protocol 2 (SBP-2) Target Mode devices driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device sbp_targ
           device firewire
           device scbus
           device targ

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following lines in loader.conf(5):

           firewire_load="YES"
           cam_load="YES"
           sbp_targ_load"YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The sbp_targ driver provides support for SBP-2 target mode.  This driver
     is supposed to work with cam(4), targ(4) and firewire(4).  You also need
     to use scsi_target(8), which can be found in
     /usr/share/examples/scsi_target, to provide actual devices.

EXAMPLES
           # mdconfig -a -t malloc -s 10m
           md0
           # scsi_target 0:0:0 /dev/md0
           (Assuming sbp_targ0 on scbus0)

SEE ALSO
     cam(4), firewire(4), targ(4), camcontrol(8), fwcontrol(8), kldload(8),
     scsi_target(8)

AUTHORS
     The sbp_targ driver was written by Hidetoshi Shimokawa.

BUGS
     This driver is currently under development.  It does not work correctly
     in multi-initiator environments or after the bus topology has been
     changed.
