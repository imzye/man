qadsl.conf(5)             FreeBSD File Formats Manual            qadsl.conf(5)

NAME
       qadsl.conf - qadsl configuration file

DESCRIPTION
       qadsl.conf is usually found in /usr/local/etc/qadsl.conf and contains
       username, password and login server information for your Internet
       connection.


SYNTAX
       The qadsl.conf syntax is extremely free form. So if you have ever
       peeked into a UNIX configuration file before, you should be right at
       home, you should not even have to read any further ...

       For those of you who hate configuration files, or never have seen one
       before, you should proceed directly to the examples section.

       For most of the time you only need to supply a USERNAME, PASSWORD and
       LOGIN_SERVER. Like this:

       USERNAME     = u1234567
       PASSWORD     = pwd12345
       LOGIN_SERVER = valo1.tiscali.se

       However, most of the time the LOGIN_SERVER setting should be given as a
       pure IP address, like this:

       LOGIN_SERVER = 10.0.0.6

       This because the name of the login server sometimes is not listed in
       the name server (DNS) of your ISP. The number 10.0.0.6 is the default
       for all Orbyte Wireless System installations.


EXAMPLES
       # Username
       USERNAME     = u1234567

       # Password
       PASSWORD     = pwd12345

       # Login Server, DNS name or IP number
       # Tiscali      valo1.tiscali.se
       # Telia        login1.telia.com
       # COMHEM       ????
       SERVER       = 10.0.0.6

       # Start daemon [YES/NO]?
       START_DAEMON = YES

       # Daemon type [LOGIN/PING]?
       DEAMON_TYPE  = LOGIN

       # Daemon delay in minutes.
       INTERVAL     = 20
