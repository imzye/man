MXGE(4)                FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                MXGE(4)

NAME
     mxge – Myricom Myri10GE 10 Gigabit Ethernet adapter driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device firmware
           device mxge

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following lines in loader.conf(5):

           if_mxge_load="YES"
           mxge_ethp_z8e_load="YES"
           mxge_eth_z8e_load="YES"
           mxge_rss_ethp_z8e_load="YES"
           mxge_rss_eth_z8e_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The mxge driver provides support for PCI Express 10 Gigabit Ethernet
     adapters based on the Myricom LANai Z8E chip.  The driver supports
     Transmit/Receive checksum offload, Jumbo Frames, TCP segmentation offload
     (TSO) as well as Large Receive Offload (LRO).  For further hardware
     information, see http://www.myri.com/.

     For questions related to hardware requirements, refer to the
     documentation supplied with your Myri10GE adapter.  All hardware
     requirements listed apply to use with FreeBSD.

     Support for Jumbo Frames is provided via the interface MTU setting.
     Selecting an MTU larger than 1500 bytes with the ifconfig(8) utility
     configures the adapter to receive and transmit Jumbo Frames.  The maximum
     MTU size for Jumbo Frames is 9000.

     For more information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

HARDWARE
     The mxge driver supports 10 Gigabit Ethernet adapters based on the
     Myricom LANai Z8E chips:

     •   Myricom 10GBase-CX4 (10G-PCIE-8A-C, 10G-PCIE-8AL-C)
     •   Myricom 10GBase-R (10G-PCIE-8A-R, 10G-PCIE-8AL-R)
     •   Myricom 10G XAUI over ribbon fiber (10G-PCIE-8A-Q, 10G-PCIE-8AL-Q)

LOADER TUNABLES
     Tunables can be set at the loader(8) prompt before booting the kernel or
     stored in loader.conf(5).

     hw.mxge.flow_control_enabled
             Whether or not hardware flow control is enabled on the adapter.
             The default value is 1.

     hw.mxge.intr_coal_delay
             This value delays the generation of all interrupts in units of 1
             microsecond.  The default value is 30.

     hw.mxge.skip_pio_read
             This value determines whether or not the driver may omit doing a
             PIO read in the interrupt handler which ensures that the
             interrupt line has been deasserted when using xPIC interrupts.  A
             non-zero value may result in lower CPU overhead, however it may
             also result in spurious interrupts.  The default value is 0.
             This tunable has no effect when the device is using MSI or MSI-X
             interrupts.

     hw.mxge.max_slices
             This value determines the maximum number of slices the driver
             will attempt to use.  The default value is 1.  A slice is
             comprised of a set of receive queues and an associated interrupt
             thread.  When using multiple slices, the NIC hashes traffic to
             different slices based on the value of hw.mxge.rss_hashtype.
             Using multiple slices requires that your motherboard and Myri10GE
             NIC both be capable of MSI-X.  Older Myri10GE NICs can be field
             upgraded to add MSI-X using the "10G NIC Tool Kit" for FreeBSD
             which is available from
             http://www.myri.com/scs/download-10g-tools.html.

     hw.mxge.rss_hashtype
             This value determines how incoming traffic is steered to
             different slices.  This tunable is ignored when using just a
             single slice.  The legal values for this tunable are:

             1     Hash on the source and destination IPv4 addresses.

             2     Hash on source and destination IPv4 addresses and if the
                   packet is TCP, then also hash on the TCP source and
                   destination ports.

             4     Hash on the TCP or UDP source ports.  This is the default
                   value.

DIAGNOSTICS
     mxge%d: Unable to allocate bus resource: memory  A fatal initialization
     error has occurred.

     mxge%d: Unable to allocate bus resource: interrupt  A fatal
     initialization error has occurred.

     mxge%d: Could not find firmware image %s  The appropriate firmware kld
     module was not installed.  This is a non-fatal initialization error, but
     will result in running in a reduced performance mode.
