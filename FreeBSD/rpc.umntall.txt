RPC.UMNTALL(8)          FreeBSD System Manager's Manual         RPC.UMNTALL(8)

NAME
     rpc.umntall – notify NFS servers about unmounted NFS file systems

SYNOPSIS
     rpc.umntall [-e expire] [-h host] [-k] [-p remotepath] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
     The rpc.umntall utility is proposed in the NFS RPC specification; see NFS
     Version 3 Protocol Specification, RFC 1813, Appendix I.  It uses remote
     procedure calls to remove mount entries from /var/db/mountdtab on the
     remote NFS server.  It is called automatically without any parameters
     during startup and shutdown of the system.  This ensures that
     showmount(8) does not display old and expired entries.  The rpc.umntall
     utility is only needed on client side, where mount_nfs(8) adds a mount
     entry with the current date to /var/db/mounttab, and umount(8) removes
     the entry again.  The rpc.umntall utility cares about all remaining
     entries in this table which result from crashes or unproper shutdowns.

     The options are as follows:

     -e expire  All entries which are not actually mounted or older than
                expire (seconds) are removed from /var/db/mounttab.  This may
                be the case for DNS changes or long out of service periods.
                Default expire time is 86400 seconds (one day).

     -h host    Only remove the specific hostname.  Send a UMNTALL RPC to the
                NFS server.

     -k         Keep entries for existing NFS file systems.  Compare the NFS
                file systems from the mounttab against the kernel mountlist
                and do not send the RPC to existing mount entries.  Useful
                during startup of the system.  It may be possible that there
                are already mounted NFS file systems, so calling RPC UMOUNT is
                not a good idea.  This is the case if the user has rebooted to
                'single user mode' and starts up the system again.

     -p path    Only remove the specific mount-path.  Send a UMOUNT RPC to the
                NFS server.  This option implies the -host option.

     -v         Verbose, additional information is printed for each processed
                mounttab entry.
