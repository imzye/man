mpck(1)                 FreeBSD General Commands Manual                mpck(1)

NAME
       mpck — check MPEG audio files

SYNOPSIS
       mpck [ options ] [ file ...  ]
       mpck [ -h | -V ]

DESCRIPTION
       mpck checks mp3s.  It scans the file to see if the frames are where
       they are supposed to be, if the frame headers are correct and if the
       headers are consistent throughout the file. It gives some statistics on
       the file, and a conclusion whether the file is good or bad.

OPTIONS
       -B --badonly
              Print statistics only for bad files.

       -e --extention=EXT
              Scan only files ending in .EXT

       -h --help
              Display a help screen and quit.

       -m --maxname=NUM
              Report bad for a file which has more than num characters in its
              filename.

       -n --namecheck
              Check for strange characters in a filename. This reports bad for
              a file with a filename consisting of characters other than [A-
              Za-z0-9 ._-].

       -q --quiet
              Print only good or bad for each file.

       -r     Short for -R -e mp3

       -R --recursive
              Treat each directory recursively, checking all files in the
              directory. Normal operation is to ignore directories.

       -v --verbose
              Be verbose.

       -V --version
              Print version and copyright information and exit.
