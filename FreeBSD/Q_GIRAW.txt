Q_IRAWMASK(3)          FreeBSD Library Functions Manual          Q_IRAWMASK(3)

NAME
     Q_IRAWMASK, Q_GIRAW, Q_GIABSVAL, Q_GIVAL, Q_SIVAL – fixed-point math
     functions which manipulate the integer data bits

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/qmath.h>

     ITYPE
     Q_IRAWMASK(QTYPE q);

     ITYPE
     Q_GIRAW(QTYPE q);

     ITYPE
     Q_GIABSVAL(QTYPE q);

     ITYPE
     Q_GIVAL(QTYPE q);

     QTYPE
     Q_SIVAL(QTYPE q, ITYPE iv);

DESCRIPTION
     Q_IRAWMASK() returns a q-specific bit mask for q's integer data bits.

     Q_GIRAW() returns q's raw masked integer data bits.

     Q_GIABSVAL() and Q_GIVAL() return the absolute and real values of q's
     integer data bits respectively.

     Q_SIVAL() sets q's integer data bits to the value iv.

     All of those functions operate on the following data types: s8q_t, u8q_t,
     s16q_t, u16q_t, s32q_t, u32q_t, s64q_t, and u64q_t, which are referred to
     generically as QTYPE.  The ITYPE refers to the stdint(7) integer types.

     For more details, see qmath(3).

RETURN VALUES
     Q_IRAWMASK(), Q_GIRAW(), Q_GIABSVAL() and Q_GIVAL() return their
     respective values as integers of the same underlying ITYPE as q.

     Q_SIVAL() returns the value of q post change.
