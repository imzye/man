SORD_VALIDATE(1)        FreeBSD General Commands Manual       SORD_VALIDATE(1)

NAME
     sord_validate – validate RDF data

SYNOPSIS
     sord_validate [-hlv] input ...

DESCRIPTION
     sord_validate is a simple validator which checks that all used properties
     are actually defined, and that the domain and range of properties is
     explicitly correct.  Note that a validation "error" here doesn't
     necessarily mean that data is invalid, since it isn't, for example,
     required to explicitly list types in RDF.  This validator implements a
     more strict and explicit set of rules, based on the realistic needs of
     simple real-world implementations.  For example, missing explicit type
     information may be warned about, even though even a simple inference
     engine would be able to deduce it.

     sord_validate never retrieves data from the web or special places on the
     file system, it only processes the files passed directly on the command
     line.  This means you must pass all used vocabularies to get a useful
     result.

     If an appropriate schema is available, literals are checked against
     datatype definitions (both the explicit datatype of the literal itself,
     as well as any types implied by the corresponding property).  Three XML
     Schema Datatypes (XSD) constraints are currently supported: regular
     expressions (xsd:pattern), and inclusive ranges (xsd:minimumInclusive and
     xsd:maximumInclusive).  Given an appropriate schema, this is enough to
     validate against most of the standard XSD datatypes.

     The options are as follows:

     -h   Print the command line options.

     -l   Print errors on a single line.

     -v   Display version information and exit.

EXIT STATUS
     sord_validate exits with a status of 0 if the input data is valid, or
     non-zero if there are issues with the data or if an error occurred.
