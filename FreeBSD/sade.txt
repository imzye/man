SADE(8)                 FreeBSD System Manager's Manual                SADE(8)

NAME
     sade – sysadmins disk editor

SYNOPSIS
     sade

DESCRIPTION
     The sade utility is used for various disk administration tasks on FreeBSD
     systems.

     It is generally invoked without arguments for the default behavior, where
     the main menu is presented.

NOTES
     The sade utility aims to provide a handy tool for disk management tasks
     on an already installed system.  The goal is to provide the same text
     interface for disk management in bsdinstall(8) in the post-installation
     environment.

SEE ALSO
     bsdinstall(8), gpart(8)

HISTORY
     A program called sade first appeared in FreeBSD 6.3 as a utility
     encapsulating features from the sysinstall(8) installer.  It was replaced
     in FreeBSD 10.0 with the equivalent part of bsdinstall(8).

BUGS
     The utility misses a lot of nice features, such as tools for manipulating
     gmirror(8).  These will be added later.
