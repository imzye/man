PFBTOPFA(1)             FreeBSD General Commands Manual            PFBTOPFA(1)

NAME
     pfbtopfa – PFB to PFA conversion

SYNOPSIS
     pfbtopfa [-i pfbfile] [-o pfafile]
     pfbtopfa [pfbfile [pfafile]]

DESCRIPTION
     The pfbtopfa utility converts PostScript Type 1 font files from the
     binary PFB format to the ASCII PFA format. It also converts any kind of
     line ending to the UNIX style \n.

USAGE
     To convert a binary font file to an ASCII font file simply enter:

           pfbtopfa pfbfile pfafile

     If no pfafile is specified, the output is sent to stdout.  Similarly, if
     no pfbfile is listed, pfbtopfa reads its input from stdin.

     If you wish to read input from stdin but send output to a file, use the
     -o flag followed by pfafile. For example,

           pfbtopfa -o pfafile

     You may also use the -i flag to specify pfbfile explicitly. If you use
     both -i and -o switches, you may list the files in any order.

HISTORY
     Both pfbtopfa and this manual page were written by G. Adam Stanislav
