GOPHERD(1)                          GoFish                          GOPHERD(1)

NAME
       gopherd - the GoFish gopher server

SYNOPSIS
       gopherd [-dp] [-v] [config_file]

DESCRIPTION
       GoFish is a very simple gopher server. It is designed with security and
       low resource usage in mind. GoFish uses a single process that handles
       all the connections. This provides low resource usage, good latency (no
       context switches), and good scalability.

       GoFish runs in a chroot(2) environment. This means that GoFish can only
       serve files from the root directory or below. While GoFish must run at
       root privilege to be able to use port 70, it drops to a normal user
       while accessing files.

OPTIONS
       -d     daemon mode

       /etc/gofish.conf
