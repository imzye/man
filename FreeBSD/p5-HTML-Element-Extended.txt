NAME
       HTML::ElementGlob - Perl extension for managing HTML::Element based
       objects as a single object.

SYNOPSIS
         use HTML::ElementGlob;
         $element_a = new HTML::Element 'font', color => 'red';
         $element_b = new HTML::Element 'font', color => 'blue';
         $element_a->push_content('red');
         $element_b->push_content('blue');

         $p = new HTML::Element 'p';
         $p->push_content($element_a, ' and ', $element_b, ' boo hoo hoo');

         # Tag type of the glob is not really relevant unless
         # you plan on seeing the glob as_HTML()
         $eglob = new HTML::ElementGlob 'p';
         $eglob->glob_push_content($element_a, $element_b);
         # Alter both elements at once
         $eglob->attr(size => 5);

         # They still belong to their original parent
         print $p->as_HTML;

DESCRIPTION
       HTML::ElementGlob is a managing object for multiple HTML::Element(3)
       style elements.  The children of the glob element retain their original
       parental elements and have no knowledge of the glob that manipulates
       them.  All methods that do not start with 'glob_' will be passed,
       sequentially, to all elements contained within the glob element.
       Methods starting with 'glob_' will operate on the glob itself, rather
       than being passed to its foster children.

       For example, $eglob->attr(size => 3) will invoke attr(size => 3) on all
       children contained by $eglob.  $eglob->glob_attr(size => 3), on the
       other hand, will set the attr attribute on the glob itself.

       The tag type passed to HTML::Element::Glob is largely irrrelevant as
       far as how methods are passed to children.  However, if you choose to
       invoke $eglob->as_HTML(), you might want to pick a tag that would
       sensibly contain the globbed children for debugging or display
       purposes.

       The 'glob_*' methods that operate on the glob itself are limited to
       those available in an HTML::Element(3).  All other methods get passed
       blindly to the globbed children, which can be enhanced elements with
       arbitrary methods, such as HTML::ElementSuper(3).

       Element globs can contain other element globs.  In such cases, the
       plain methods will cascade down to the leaf children.  'glob_*'
       methods, of course, will not be propogated to children globs.  You will
       have to rely on glob_content() to access those glob children and access
       their 'glob_*' methods directly.

REQUIRES
       HTML::ElementSuper(3)
