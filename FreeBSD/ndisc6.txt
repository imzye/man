ADDR2NAME(1)                     User's Manual                    ADDR2NAME(1)

NAME
       addr2name, name2addr - perform DNS lookups from scripts

SYNOPSIS
       addr2name [-46cmnr] [HOSTNAMES]

       name2addr [-46cn] [HOSTNAMES]


DESCRIPTON
       Write addresses or canonical hostname of specified names to the
       standard output. If no names are specified via the command line, they
       are read from the standard input.


OPTIONS
       -4 or --ipv4
              Only try to perform IPv4 lookups.


       -6 or --ipv6
              Only try to perform IPv6 lookups.


       -c or --config
              Only lookup and print results for address families that match
              locally configured addresses (If the system has no IPv4 resp
              IPv6 address, then IPv4 resp IPv6 addresses are ignored).


       -h or --help
              Display some help and exit.


       -m or --multiple
              Normally, if a name yields multiple results, only the first one
              is printed.  With this optional parameter, all results will be
              printed on a single line, separated by spaces.


       -n or --numeric
              Prevent forward hostname lookup.  This ensures that the input
              names are numeric addresses, which do not need to be looked up.
              Typically used along with the --reverse option to convert
              numerical addresses to canonical hostnames.


       -r or --reverse
              Perform a reverse DNS lookup (enabled implicitly with
              addr2name).  addr2name prints numerical resolved addresses by
              default instead.


       --version
              Display program version and license and exit.
