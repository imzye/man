NAME
       pkg_tree - Generate a graphical tree of packages and their dependencies

SYNOPSIS
       pkg_tree [-bqrtv] [package-prefix ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This program generates a graphical tree of packages and their
       dependancies.

USAGE
       To show the dependencies of all packages, run it without arguments:

       [~] edwin@k7>pkg_tree

       To show the dependencies of one package, run it with an argument:

        [~] edwin@k7>pkg_tree linux-netscape
        linux-netscape-navigator-4.79
        |\__ netscape-remote-1.0_1
        |\__ netscape-wrapper-2000.07.07
        |\__ linux_base-6.1
        |\__ imake-4.1.0 (unknown)
        |\__ freetype2-2.0.5
         \__ XFree86-libraries-4.1.0 (unknown)

       To also show the dependencies of the dependencies, use the -v
       parameter:

        [~] edwin@k7>pkg_tree -v linux-netscape
        linux-netscape-navigator-4.79
        |\__ netscape-remote-1.0_1
        |     |\__ imake-4.1.0 (unknown)
        |     |\__ freetype2-2.0.3 (unknown)
        |      \__ XFree86-libraries-4.1.0 (unknown)
        |\__ netscape-wrapper-2000.07.07
        |     |\__ freetype2-2.0.3 (unknown)
        |     |\__ imake-4.1.0 (unknown)
        |     |\__ netscape-remote-1.0_1
        |     |     |\__ imake-4.1.0 (unknown)
        |     |     |\__ freetype2-2.0.3 (unknown)
        |     |      \__ XFree86-libraries-4.1.0 (unknown)
        |      \__ XFree86-libraries-4.1.0 (unknown)
        |\__ linux_base-6.1
        |\__ imake-4.1.0 (unknown)
        |\__ freetype2-2.0.5
         \__ XFree86-libraries-4.1.0 (unknown)

       Use the -t parameter to show only top level packages, and -b to show
       only bottom level packages. And -t -q together will give the list of
       top level packages without their dependencies, installing only these
       packages should install all currently installed packages.

       Use the -r parameter to show requirements relation.

RETURN VALUES
       Always 0.

BUGS
       Ports which have upgraded ports in their dependencies don't show their
       dependencies anymore if the old port is deleted; it then prints
       "(unknown)".
