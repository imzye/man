NAME
       ARP - Perl extension for creating ARP packets

SYNOPSIS
         use Net::ARP;
         Net::ARP::send_packet('lo',                 # Device
                               '127.0.0.1',          # Source IP
                                     '127.0.0.1',          # Destination IP
                                           'aa:bb:cc:aa:bb:cc',  # Source MAC
                                     'aa:bb:cc:aa:bb:cc',  # Destinaton MAC
                                     'reply');             # ARP operation

       $mac = Net::ARP::get_mac("enp3s0f1");

       print "$mac\n";

       $mac = Net::ARP::arp_lookup($dev,"192.168.1.1");

       print "192.168.1.1 has got mac $mac\n";

   IMPORTANT
       Version 1.0 will break with the API of PRE-1.0 versions, because the
       return value of arp_lookup() and get_mac() will no longer be passed as
       parameter, but returned!  I hope this decision is ok as long as we get
       a cleaner and more perlish API.

   DESCRIPTION
       This module can be used to create and send ARP packets and to get the
       mac address of an ethernet interface or ip address.

       send_packet()
             Net::ARP::send_packet('lo',                 # Device
                                   '127.0.0.1',          # Source IP
                                         '127.0.0.1',          # Destination IP
                                               'aa:bb:cc:aa:bb:cc',  # Source MAC
                                         'aa:bb:cc:aa:bb:cc',  # Destinaton MAC
                                         'reply');             # ARP operation

             I think this is self documentating.
             ARP operation can be one of the following values:
             request, reply, revrequest, revreply, invrequest, invreply.

       get_mac()
             $mac = Net::ARP::get_mac("enp3s0f1");

             This gets the MAC address of the enp3s0f1 interface and stores
             it in the variable $mac. The return value is "unknown" if
             the mac cannot be looked up.

       arp_lookup()
             $mac = Net::ARP::arp_lookup($dev,"192.168.1.1");

             This looks up the MAC address for the ip address 192.168.1.1
             and stores it in the variable $mac. The return value is
             "unknown" if the mac cannot be looked up.
