NAME
       tuboexec - Helper application for spawning independent processes.

SYNOPSIS
       This program is run by the Tubo_exec() function of the libtubo library.
       Tubo_fork() is the preferred command in Linux/BSD. In Windows, fork()
       is not available, so Tubo_exec() is your only option there.
