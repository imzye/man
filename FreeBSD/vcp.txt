VCP(1)                  FreeBSD General Commands Manual                 VCP(1)

NAME
       VCP - Copy files in a curses interface

SYNOPSIS
       options [-vdpVmhtu] [-I | -i | -f | -n] [-R [-P | -H | -L]]
               [-b bytes]
       vcp [options] src dest
       vcp [options] src1 src2 .. destdir
       vcp [options -m] src dest1 dest2 ..

DESCRIPTION
       vcp copies files and directories in a curses interface, with text only
       output available. its options and output are similar to BSD's cp while
       adding some new features.
       It provides information on:
       - files copied and left to copy
       - data written and total data size
       - data being written every second
       - two status bars, one showing current file status, the other total
       status
         (except with 1 file, both show current), and percentage
       when output is sent to the console:
       - a status bar
       - size copied and speed

       The config file (vcp.conf.sample) supports a few options,
       - color
       - screen state
       - default flags
       - read bufer size
       vcp checks the following files in order:
       1. /usr/local/etc/vcp.conf
       2. ~/.vcp
       options are overwritten as they are read.

OPTIONS
       -R     Copies directories (if the destination is a directory) with the
              destination as the subtree, symbolic links are re-created and
              will not be indirected through, hard links are copied as
              seperate files. Attempts to create special files instead of
              copying them.

       -P     Needs -R. No symbolic links are followed. Default.

       -H     Needs -R. Follows symbolic links on the command line. Other
              symbolic links are not followed.

       -L     Needs -R. All symbolic links are followed.

       -f     Exisiting files will be overwritten and re-created, without
              reguarding the permission.

       -n     No existing files are overwritten.

       -i     User is asked whether to overwrite a file or not when an
              existing file is found. If the first input character is a y or Y
              the file is overwritten. The default (Enter key) does not
              overwrite the file.

       -I     Same as -i, except the default (Enter key) is to overwrite the
              file.

       -v     Verbose messages are printed.

       -t     Text only output, a curses interface is not invoked and output
              is sent to the console.

       -d     Delayed copying, les CPU and read/write, this will take longer.

       -p     Attempts to copy files with as much information from the
              original as possible, access time, flags, file modes, user IDs
              and group IDs. This is restricted if you do not have permission.
              User and group IDs are handled similar to cp.

       -m     Multi-output copy, copies one source to all the destinations.

       -b     Sets the read buffer size in bytes, default is 204800

       -V     Prints version and exits.

       -u     Files present with newer time stamp and same size are not
              copied.

       -h     Prints detailed usage and exits.

FILES
       /usr/local/etc/vcp.conf - global
       $HOME/.vcp - user

BUGS
       Special files, without -R, are not handled the way cp(1) does.
