     device_probe_and_attach – initialise a device

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <sys/bus.h>

     int
     device_probe_and_attach(device_t dev);

DESCRIPTION
     This function is called during autoconfiguration to initialise the
     devices in the system.  For each device, the DEVICE_PROBE(9) method of
     each suitable driver is called and if a probe succeeds, a description of
     the device is printed and the DEVICE_ATTACH(9) method is called.  If the
     device is disabled using device_disable(9) then it will not be probed.

RETURN VALUES
     Zero is returned on success, otherwise an appropriate error is returned.
