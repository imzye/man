HTTP::Cookies::Mozilla(3)                  User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       HTTP::Cookies::Mozilla - Cookie storage and management for Mozilla

SYNOPSIS
               use HTTP::Cookies::Mozilla;

               my $file = ...; # Firefox profile dir / cookies.sqlite
               my $cookie_jar = HTTP::Cookies::Mozilla->new( file => $file );

               # otherwise same as HTTP::Cookies

DESCRIPTION
       This package overrides the load() and save() methods of HTTP::Cookies
       so it can work with Mozilla cookie files. These might be stored in the
       user profile directory as cookies. On macOS,for instance, that's
       ~/Application Support/Firefox/*/cookies.sqlite.

       This module should be able to work with all Mozilla derived browsers
       (FireBird, Camino, et alia).

       Note that as of FireFox, version 3, the cookie file format changed from
       plain text files to SQLite databases, so you will need to have either
       DBI/DBD::SQLite, or the sqlite3 executable somewhere in the path.
       Neither one has been put as explicit dependency, anyway, so you'll get
       an exception if you try to use this module with a new style file but
       without having any of them:

          neither DBI nor pipe to sqlite3 worked (%s), install either one

       If your command-line sqlite3 is not in the $ENV{PATH}, you can set
       $HTTP::Cookies::Mozilla::SQLITE to point to the actual program to be
       used, e.g.:

          use HTTP::Cookies::Mozilla;
          $HTTP::Cookies::Mozilla::SQLITE = '/path/to/sqlite3';

       Usage of the external program is supported under perl 5.8 onwards only,
       because previous perl versions do not support "open" in perlfunc with
       more than three arguments, which are safer. If you are still sticking
       to perl 5.6, you'll have to install DBI/DBD::SQLite to make FireFox 3
       cookies work.

       See HTTP::Cookies.
