NAME
       Reply - read, eval, print, loop, yay!

VERSION
       version 0.42

SYNOPSIS
         use Reply;

         Reply->new(config => "$ENV{HOME}/.replyrc")->run;

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE: This is an early release, and implementation details of this
       module are still very much in flux. Feedback is welcome!

       Reply is a lightweight, extensible REPL for Perl. It is plugin-based
       (see Reply::Plugin), and through plugins supports many advanced
       features such as coloring and pretty printing, readline support, and
       pluggable commands.

METHODS
   new(%opts)
       Creates a new Reply instance. Valid options are:

       config
           Name of a configuration file to load. This should contain INI-style
           configuration for plugins as described above.

       plugins
           An arrayref of additional plugins to load.

   run
       Runs the repl. Will continue looping until the "read_line" callback
       returns undef (typically when the user presses "Ctrl+D"), or the "loop"
       callback returns false (by default, the "#q" command quits the repl in
       this way).

   step($line, $verbose)
       Runs a single iteration of the repl. If $line is given, it will be used
       as the string to evaluate (and the "prompt" and "read_line" callbacks
       will not be called). If $verbose is true, the prompt and line will be
       displayed as though they were typed. Returns true if the repl can
       continue, and false if it was requested to quit.

CONFIGURATION
       Configuration uses an INI-style format similar to the configuration
       format of Dist::Zilla. Section names are used as the names of plugins,
       and any options within a section are passed as arguments to that
       plugin. Plugins are loaded in order as they are listed in the
       configuration file, which can affect the results in some cases where
       multiple plugins are hooking into a single callback (see Reply::Plugin
       for more information).

       In addition to plugin configuration, there are some additional options
       recognized. These must be specified at the top of the file, before any
       section headers.

       script_file
           This contains a filename whose contents will be evaluated as perl
           code once the configuration is done being loaded.

       script_line<n>
           Any options that start with "script_line" will be sorted by their
           key and then each value will be evaluated individually once the
           configuration is done being loaded.

           NOTE: this is currently a hack due to the fact that Config::INI
           doesn't support multiple keys with the same name in a section. This
           may be fixed in the future to just allow specifying "script_line"
           multiple times.
