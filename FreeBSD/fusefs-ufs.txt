FUSE-UFS(8)             FreeBSD System Manager's Manual            FUSE-UFS(8)

NAME
     fuse-ufs – FUSE3 implementation of FreeBSD's UFSv2

SYNOPSIS
     fuse-ufs [-fqv] [-o options] special mountpoint
     fuse-ufs --help

DESCRIPTION
     fuse-ufs allows you to mount a FreeBSD UFSv2 filesystem.

     The following options are available:

     -o opt,[opt...]
             Mount options, see below for details.

     -o allow_other
             Allow other users to access the mounted filesystem.

     -o allow_root
             Allow the root user to access the mounted filesystem.

     -o default_permissions
             Let the kernel check file permissions.  This is already the
             default for this filesystem.

     -o dev|nodev
             Allow/prohibit using devices on the mounted filesystem.

     -o exec|noexec
             Allow/prohibit executing programs from the mounted filesystem.

     -o suid|nosuid
             Allow/prohibit honoring the setuid-bit when running programs from
             the mounted filesystem.

     -o async|atime|dirsync|noatime|sync|ro
             These options have no effect on the mounted filesystem, as there
             is no write support yet.

     -o rw   As write support is not present, this option causes the program
             to crash.

     -f      Wait for the filesystem to be unmounted before exiting.

     -v      Increase the logging verbosity (this flag can be specified
             multiple times).

     -q      Decrease the logging verbosity.

     -h, --help
             Print a help page and exit.

     -V, --version
             Print the version and exit.

EXIT STATUS
     The fuse-ufs utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Mount /dev/sda1 onto /mnt:

           $ fuse-ufs /dev/sda1 /mnt

     The same, but allow other users to access the mounted filesystem:

           $ fuse-ufs -o allow_other /dev/sda1 /mnt

CAVEATS
     Only 64-bit Linux & FreeBSD systems have been tested to work.  Support
     for other systems (like MacOS) will be on a best-effort basis for now.

     Missing features:
     •   Write Support (TODO)
     •   Soft-Updates (TODO)
     •   Sun/Solaris UFS (TODO)
     •   Journaling
     •   Snapshots
     •   ACLs

BUGS
     This software is not yet ready to be used in production, as it contains
     unfixed bugs that lead to crashes.
