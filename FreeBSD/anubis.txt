NAME
       GNU Anubis -- an SMTP message submission daemon.

SYNOPSIS
       anubis [options]


DESCRIPTION
       GNU Anubis is an SMTP message submission daemon. It represents an
       intermediate layer between mail user agent (MUA) and mail transport
       agent (MTA), receiving messages from the MUA, applying to them a set of
       predefined changes and finally inserting modified messages into an MTA
       routing network. The set of changes applied to a message is
       configurable on a system-wide and per-user basis. The built-in
       configuration language used for defining sets of changes allows for
       considerable flexibility and is easily extensible.


THE GNU ANUBIS MANUAL
       The full documentation for GNU Anubis is maintained as a Texinfo
       manual.  If the info and GNU Anubis programs are properly installed at
       your site, the command

              info anubis

       should give you access to the complete manual.
