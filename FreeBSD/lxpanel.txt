NAME
       lxpanel - a lightweight GTK2-based panel for the LXDE desktop.

SYNOPSIS
       lxpanel [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the lxpanel command.

       lxpanel is a program that provides a panel for the desktop, usually for
       LXDE. It is a lightweight GTK+ 2.x based desktop panel.

       Features

       •   User-friendly application menu automatically generated from
           .desktop files on the system.

       •   Launcher bar (small icons clicked to launch apps)

       •   Task bar supporting ICCCM/EWMH `urgency' hint (Pidgin IM windows
           can flash on new incoming messages)

       •   Notification area (system tray)

       •   Digital clock

       •   Run dialog (type command to run, without opening a terminal )

       •   Net status icon plug-in (optional)

       •   Volume control plug-in (optional)

       •   lxpanelctl, an external controller lets you control lxpanel in
           other programs. For example, "lxpanelctl run" will show the Run
           dialog in lxpanel, and "lxpanelctl menu" will show the application
           menu. This is useful in key bindings provided by window managers.
