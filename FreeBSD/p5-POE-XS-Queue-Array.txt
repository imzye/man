NAME
       POE::XS::Queue::Array - an XS implementation of POE::Queue::Array.

SYNOPSIS
       See POE::Queue.

DESCRIPTION
       This class is an implementation of the abstract POE::Queue interface.
       It implements a priority queue using C, with an XS interface supplied.

       The current implementation could use some optimization, especially for
       large queues.

       Please see the POE::Queue documentation, which explains this one's
       functions, features, and behavior.

       The following extra methods are added beyond POE::Queue::Array:

       dump
           Dumps the internal structure of the queue to stderr.

       verify
           Does limited verification of the structure of the queue.  If the
           verification fails then a message is sent to stderr and the queue
           is dumped as with the dump() method, and your program will exit.

SEE ALSO
       POE, POE::Queue, POE::Queue::Array

BUGS
       None known.

       Some possible improvements include:

       •   use a B-Tree for the queue (not a binary tree, a B-Tree), though
           this would require a module rename.

       •   use a custom hash instead of a HV for the id to priority mapping,
           either glib's hash or convert to C++ and use the STL map.

       •   some of the XS code could be optimized to do less work in scalar
           context, pq_remove_items and pq_peek_items could avoid building all
           those array refs.
