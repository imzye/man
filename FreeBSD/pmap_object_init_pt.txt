PMAP_OBJECT_INIT_PT(9)                       FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual

NAME
     pmap_object_init_pt – initialize page tables for a VM object

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <vm/vm.h>
     #include <vm/pmap.h>

     void
     pmap_object_init_pt(pmap_t pmap, vm_offset_t addr, vm_object_t object,
         vm_pindex_t pindex, vm_size_t size, int limit);

DESCRIPTION
     The pmap_object_init_pt() function preloads the page table entries into
     the specified physical map pmap, for the given object at the virtual
     address addr, for size bytes, beginning at the page index pindex within
     the object.  The map bits limit are heeded when creating the mapping.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
     This function is not strictly required by an architecture's pmap(9)
     implementation, but it does provide performance benefits if implemented.

     It is intended to eliminate the blast of soft faults on process startup,
     and immediately following a call to mmap(2).
