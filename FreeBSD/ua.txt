KUA(1)                           User Commands                          KUA(1)

NAME
       kua -  find files which are identical to the given one (comes from the
              Hungarian keresd ugyanazt - meaning "find the same")


SYNOPSIS
       kua [OPTION]... -f <file> [FILE]...


DESCRIPTION
       kua will look for files which are identical to the one given as the
       argument of -f. The files found will be printed on separate lines.


OPTIONS
       -i     ignore letter case

       -w     ignore white spaces

       -n     do not ask the file system for file size

       -v     verbose output (prints stuff to stderr), verbose help

       -b size
              set internal buffer size (default 1024)

       -h     this help (-vh more verbose help)

       -      read file names from stdin, where each line contains one file
              name (this must also be the last option in the list)


OUTPUT
       The files found will be printed on separate lines.


EXAMPLES
       Get help on usage:

              $ kua -h
              $ kua -vh

       Find the files identical to fav.mpg under home:

              $ find ~ -type f | kua -f ~/music/fav.mpg -

       Only files which have the same size (according to the FS) will be
       considered.


       Find files identical to x.h, ignoring white spaces:

              $ find ~/code -name '*.h' | kua -b256 -wf ~/code/X/x.h -

       Since the comparison ignores white spaces, use a smaller buffer (of 256
       bytes).  White space ignoring comparison will not care about the file
       size and thus it is significantly slower.
