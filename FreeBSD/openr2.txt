r2test.conf(5)                                                  r2test.conf(5)

NAME
       r2test.conf - OpenR2 r2test program configuration file

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/openr2/r2test.conf

DESCRIPTION
       This file defines the behavior of the r2test program

       This file works pretty much like Asterisk zapata.conf file, the channel
       parameter will create a R2 context with the specified range of channels
       and will take all the preceding parameters as configuration.

SYNTAX
       No spaces are allowed in parameter definition, lines starting with # or
       spaces will be ignored

       This definition will not be read properly

       param = value

       This definition will be read fine

       param=value


OPTIONS
       category=<NATIONAL_SUBSCRIBER, NATIONAL_PRIORITY_SUBSCRIBER,
       INTERNATIONAL_SUBSCRIBER, INTERNATIONAL_PRIORITY_SUBSCRIBER>
              Defines the call category of subscriber. Defaults to
              NATIONAL_SUBSCRIBER

       loglevel=<all,error,warning,debug,notice,cas,mf,stack,nothing>
              Defines the log level for debugging purposes. Defaults to all

              error, warning, debug, notice These options are self-descriptive

              cas is for logging ABCD CAS tx and rx

              mf is for logging of the Multi Frequency tones

              stack is for very verbose output of the channel and context call
              stack, only useful if you are debugging a crash or want to learn
              how the library works.  The stack logging will be only enabled
              if the OpenR2 library was compiled with -DOR2_TRACE_STACKS

              all is a special value to log all the activity

              nothing is a clean-up value, in case you want to not log any
              activity for a channel or group of channels

              You can mix up values, like: loglevel=error,debug,mf to log just
              error, debug and multi frequency messages


       callfile=<yes|no>
              Call files useful to debug signaling issues are dumped in the
              current directory if this parameter is enabled. Defaults to no


       variant=<br,mx,ar,itu>
              R2 country variant. Defaults to mx


       maxani How much ANI to expect. Defaults to 10


       maxdnis
              How much DNIS to expect. Defaults to 4


       getanifirst=<yes|no>
              Whether or not we want to request ANI first. Defaults to no


       usedahdimf=<yes|no>
              Whether to use the built-in OpenR2 MF tone generation or DAHDI
              MF tone generation. DAHDI is faster since it does not require to
              copy user space buffers to the kernel, however this option will
              only be available when the configure script detects DAHDI
              support for MF R2 tone generation.  Defaults to no


       mfthreshold
              MF threshold in milliseconds. This is the amount of time a R2 MF
              signal is required to be ON or OFF after has been detected to be
              handled. 0 means as soon as we detect a signal we handle it.
              This aids when a buggy generator or detector causes small false
              positives. Defaults to 0


       mfbacktimeout
              MF backward timeout in milliseconds to use OpenR2 default just
              specify any negative number or comment this line. Defaults to -1


       meteringpulsetimeout
              Value in milliseconds for the metering pulse timeout, any
              negative value means default. Defaults to -1


       collectcalls=<yes|no>
              Whether to accept collect calls (see also doubleanswer).
              Defaults to no


       doubleanswer=<yes|no>
              This option are related but independent of collectcalls. If you
              have problems to block collect calls using Group B signals
              (collectcalls), enable this option. Defaults to no


       immediateaccept=<yes|no>
              Whether to skip Group B/II signals and go directly to the
              accepted state for an incoming call. Defaults to no


       advancedprotocolfile
              This option is for advanced users only! Define a file that
              contains hacks to R2 protocol. This allow advanced users to fine
              tune the library or make test with specific scenarios to include
              in the library in the future.


       playaudio=<yes|no>
              This feature allows you to play an alaw audio file for
              incoming/outgoing calls.  Defaults to no


       audiofile
              If you set playaudio=yes you should provide the path to the
              audio file


       channel
              Define range of channels to configure using previous options.
              The channel range must be specified, unless you will use only
              one channel. If this option is specified after dnid, cid and
              caller that options will be used. Defaults to

              channel=1-15
              channel=17-31


       dnid   Defines the destination number. Only used if .B caller = yes


       cid    Defines the caller id number. Only used if .B caller = yes



       caller=<yes|no>
              Whether or not the group of channels will start a call to the
              specified dnid.  Defaults to yes
