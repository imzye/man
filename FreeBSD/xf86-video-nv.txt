DESCRIPTION
       nv is an Xorg driver for NVIDIA video cards.  The driver supports 2D
       acceleration and provides support for the following framebuffer depths:
       8, 15, 16 (except Riva128) and 24.  All visual types are supported for
       depth 8, TrueColor and DirectColor visuals are supported for the other
       depths with the exception of the Riva128 which only supports TrueColor
       in the higher depths.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for general configuration details.  This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The driver auto-detects the chipset type and the amount of video memory
       present for all chips.

       The following driver Options are supported for pre-G80 hardware:

       Option "HWCursor" "boolean"
              Enable or disable the HW cursor.  Default: on.

       Option "NoAccel" "boolean"
              Disable or enable acceleration.  Default: acceleration is
              enabled.

       Option "UseFBDev" "boolean"
              Enable or disable use of an OS-specific fb interface (and is not
              supported on all OSs).  See fbdevhw(4x) for further information.
              Default: off.

       Option "CrtcNumber" "integer"
              Many graphics cards with NVIDIA chips have two video outputs.
              The driver attempts to autodetect which one the monitor is
              connected to.  In the case that autodetection picks the wrong
              one, this option may be used to force usage of a particular
              output.  The options are "0" or "1".  Default: autodetected.

       Option "Dualhead" "boolean"
              Enables simple VBE-based dual head mode.  This sets the same
              resolution on both outputs and lays them out side-by-side.  The
              screens will be panned together as one big metamode if the
              virtual desktop is larger than both screens combined.

       Option "FlatPanel" "boolean"
              The driver usually can autodetect the presence of a digital flat
              panel.  In the case that this fails, this option can be used to
              force the driver to treat the attached device as a digital flat
              panel.  With this driver, a digital flat panel will work only if
              it was POSTed by the BIOS, that is, the computer must have
              booted to the panel.  If you have a dual head card you may also
              need to set the option CrtcNumber described above.  Default:
              autodetected.

       Option "FPDither" "boolean"
              Many digital flat panels (particularly ones on laptops) have
              only 6 bits per component color resolution.  This option tells
              the driver to dither from 8 bits per component to 6 before the
              flat panel truncates it.  Default: off.

       Option "FPScale" "boolean"
              Supported only on GeForce4 and newer chips, this option tells to
              the driver to scale lower resolutions up to the flat panel's
              native resolution.  Default: on.

       Option "Rotate" "CW"

       Option "Rotate" "CCW"
              Rotate the display clockwise or counterclockwise.  This mode is
              unaccelerated.  Default: no rotation.

              Note: The Resize and Rotate extension will be disabled if the
              Rotate "CW" or Rotate "CCW" options are used.

       Option "Rotate" "RandR"
              Enable rotation of the screen using the Resize and Rotate
              extension.  This mode is unaccelerated.  Default: no rotation
              support.

       Option "ShadowFB" "boolean"
              Enable or disable use of the shadow framebuffer layer.  Default:
              off.

       The following driver Options are available for G80 and higher:

       Option "HWCursor" "boolean"
              Enable or disable the hardware cursor.  Default: on.

       Option "NoAccel" "boolean"
              Disable or enable acceleration.  Default: acceleration is
              enabled.

       Option "AccelMethod" "string"
              Choose acceleration architecture, either "XAA" or "EXA".  XAA is
              the old but stable architecture.  EXA is newer and supports
              resizing the desktop larger than it started out with RandR 1.2.
              If you choose to use EXA, you might also consider setting Option
              "MigrationHeuristic" "greedy" to improve performance.  Default:
              XAA.

       Option "FPDither" "boolean"
              Enable or disable flat panel dithering by default.  Dithering
              can also be enabled or disabled using the RandR 1.2 "dither"
              output property.  Default: off.

       Option "AllowDualLinkModes" "boolean"
              Allow validation of dual-link DVI modes.  Not all GPUs are
              configured at boot time to be able to handle dual-link modes, so
              they are disabled by default.

       The following RandR 1.2 properties are available for flat panels on G80
       and higher GPUs:

       dither Enable or disable flat panel dithering.  Valid values: 0 (off),
              1 (on).

       scale  Control how the image is scaled to fit the flat panel.  Note
              that some flat panels perform their own scaling, overriding this
              option.  "off" is not valid for laptop flat panels (LVDS).
              Valid values: "off", "aspect", "fill", and "center".  Default:
              "aspect".
