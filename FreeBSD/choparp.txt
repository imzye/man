CHOPARP(8)              FreeBSD System Manager's Manual             CHOPARP(8)

NAME
     choparp – cheap and omitted proxy ARP

SYNOPSIS
     chpoarp if_name mac_addr [-]net_addr[/net_mask] ...

DESCRIPTION
     choparp is a easy-to-use proxy ARP daemon.  It watches ARP request
     packets visible on the interface specified by argument if_name, and sends
     proxy ARP reply to the sender if the ARP request queries the MAC address
     (ethernet hardware address) for the network specified by net_addr/
     net_mask.

     mac_addr is th MAC address to be published for the specified hosts.  It
     is normally the address of if_name.  The format of mac_addr must be 6
     colon-separated bytes of hexadecimal value, such as 00:00:01:01:14:46.
     The keyword auto can also be used to use the address of if_name from the
     system configuration.

     A carp(4) virtual router address can be specified as vhid:<hex>

     net_addr must be in dotted quad notation (for example 133.138.1.134) or
     be a 32 bit hexadecimal value starting with “0x” (for example
     0x858a0186).  net_mask can likewise be speficied as a dotted quad or
     hexadecimal value, or alternatively as a mask length. The following
     address specifications are therefore equivalent:

           192.168.98.0/255.255.254.0

           192.168.98.0/0xfffffe00

           192.168.98.0/23

     Multiple addresses can be specified.  Addresses can be excluded by
     preceding them with -

EXAMPLES
     If you have network interface “ne0” with MAC address “00:00:01:01:14:16”,
     and would like to send proxy ARP reply for 192.168.0.64/26, the argument
     would be as follows:

           choparp ne0 00:00:01:01:14:46 192.168.0.64/255.255.255.192

BUGS
     Supports Ethernet interfaces only.  Handles single interface at a time.
     (you can start multiple choparp for multiple interfaces, though).
