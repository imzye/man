     bus_delayed_attach_children – request that the children be attached when
     interrupts are enabled

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <sys/bus.h>

     int
     bus_delayed_attach_children(device_t dev);

     this device be attached when interrupts are running.  If interrupts are
     currently running, this happens immediately.  If interrupts are not yet
     running, this happens after interrupts are enabled, but before the system
     mounts root.
