NAME
       optench - A virtual optical bench.

SYNOPSIS
       optench [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       Optench is a virtual optical bench for the design of optical systems.
       It simulates interactions between light sources, lenses, mirrors and
       occluders.

OPTIONS
       Optench does not have any command line options of its own. It supports
       the default command line options supported by Qt6, see
       https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qapplication.html#QApplication for details.

       You can optionally start Optench with a file path. If you do Optench
       will attempt to open this file upon startup and display its contents
       for editing.
