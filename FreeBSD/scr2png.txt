SCR2PNG(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             SCR2PNG(1)

NAME
     scr2png – convert a video memory dump to a PNG image

SYNOPSIS
     scr2png [-f font-file] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
     The scr2png utility reads a video memory dump, such as that created by
     the vidcontrol(1) utility, and converts it to a PNG image, using the font
     file specified by the user, or a default font if none is specified.
     scr2png reads from the standard input, and writes to the standard output.

     The following options are available:

     -f font-file
              Use the font read from font-file when rendering characters on to
              the image.  scr2png reads the same font files used by the
              vidcontrol(1) utility.  The default font file is
              /usr/share/syscons/fonts/cp850-8x16.fnt.

     -v       Use a VGA adapter palette.  The default colours used by scr2png
              match those used by many X11 terminal implementations.  However,
              they do not closely match those used by a typical VGA adapter.
              Use -v and the colours are more likely to match those originally
              displayed.

     See scrshot(1) for information about the input file format expected by
     scr2png.

RETURN VALUES
     The scr2png utility exits 0 on success or >0 if an error occurred.

EXAMPLES
     The command sequence:

           vidcontrol -p < /dev/ttyv0 > shot.scr
           scr2png < shot.scr > shot.png

     will capture the contents of the first virtual terminal, and redirect the
     output to the shot.scr file.  scr2png then processes this file, and
     writes the output to shot.png.  Of course this could be rewritten as

           vidcontrol -p < /dev/ttyv0 | scr2png > shot.png

     This example captures a screen shot, and then produces two different PNG
     images using different fonts.

           vidcontrol -p < /dev/ttyv0 > shot.scr
           scr2png < shot.scr > shot-1.png
           scr2png -f /usr/share/syscons/fonts/cp850-8x14.fnt < shot.scr > shot-2.png
