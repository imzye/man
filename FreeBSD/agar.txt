AG_ALPHAFN(3)          FreeBSD Library Functions Manual          AG_ALPHAFN(3)

NAME
     AG_AlphaFn – agar pixel arithmetic function

SYNOPSIS
     #include <agar/core.h>
     #include <agar/gui.h>

DESCRIPTION
     The AG_AlphaFn type specifies an arithmetic operation to use when
     blending two pixels. The incoming pixel is referred to as the "source"
     pixel. The target pixel already in the frame buffer is referred to as the
     "destination" pixel.  AG_AlphaFn is defined as:

     typedef enum ag_blend_func {
             AG_ALPHA_OVERLAY,               /* MIN(sA+dA, 1) */
             AG_ALPHA_ZERO,                  /* 0 */
             AG_ALPHA_ONE,                   /* 1 */
             AG_ALPHA_SRC,                   /* sA */
             AG_ALPHA_DST,                   /* dA */
             AG_ALPHA_ONE_MINUS_DST,         /* 1-dA */
             AG_ALPHA_ONE_MINUS_SRC          /* 1-sA */
     } AG_AlphaFn;

     The blending functions differ in how the weight of the destination pixel
     (versus the weight of the source pixel) is selected.

     AG_PIXEL_SRC uses the alpha component of the source pixel (sA).

     AG_PIXEL_DST uses the alpha component of the destination pixel (dA),

     AG_PIXEL_OVERLAY uses the sum of the source and alpha components clamped
     to the maximum value that can be represented by an AG_Component.

     AG_PIXEL_ONE_MINUS_SRC and AG_PIXEL_ONE_MINUS_DST use the value 1 minus
     the source and destination alpha component.

HISTORY
     The AG_AlphaFn type first appeared in Agar 1.3.4 under the name
     AG_BlendFn.  It was renamed AG_AlphaFn and AG_ALPHA_{ZERO,ONE} were added
     in Agar 1.6.0.

Agar 1.7                         March 6, 2023                        Agar 1.7
