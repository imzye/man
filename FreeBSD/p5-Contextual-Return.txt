                       . "  array: @{$foo}\n"
                       . "  hash:  $foo->{name} => $foo->{value}\n"
                       ;
               }
               print {$foo} $foo->();
           }

DESCRIPTION
       Usually, when you need to create a subroutine that returns different
       values in different contexts (list, scalar, or void), you write
       something like:

           sub get_server_status {
               my ($server_ID) = @_;

               # Acquire server data somehow...
               my %server_data = _ascertain_server_status($server_ID);

               # Return different components of that data,
               # depending on call context...
               if (wantarray()) {
                   return @server_data{ qw(name uptime load users) };
               }
               if (defined wantarray()) {
                   return $server_data{load};
               }
               if (!defined wantarray()) {
                   carp 'Useless use of get_server_status() in void context';
                   return;
               }
               else {
                   croak q{Bad context! No biscuit!};
               }
           }

       That works okay, but the code could certainly be more readable. In its
       simplest usage, this module makes that code more readable by providing
       three subroutines--LIST(), SCALAR(), VOID()--that are true only when
       the current subroutine is called in the corresponding context:

           use Contextual::Return;

           sub get_server_status {
               my ($server_ID) = @_;

               # Acquire server data somehow...
               my %server_data = _ascertain_server_status($server_ID);

               # Return different components of that data
               # depending on call context...
               if (LIST)   { return @server_data{ qw(name uptime load users) } }
               if (SCALAR) { return $server_data{load}                         }
               if (VOID)   { print "$server_data{load}\n"                      }
               else        { croak q{Bad context! No biscuit!}                 }
           }

   Contextual returns
       Those three subroutines can also be used in another way: as labels on a
       series of contextual return blocks (collectively known as a contextual
       return sequence). When a context sequence is returned, it automatically
       selects the appropriate contextual return block for the calling
       context.  So the previous example could be written even more cleanly
       as:

           use Contextual::Return;

           sub get_server_status {
               my ($server_ID) = @_;

               # Acquire server data somehow...
               my %server_data = _ascertain_server_status($server_ID);

               # Return different components of that data
               # depending on call context...
               return (
                   LIST    { return @server_data{ qw(name uptime load users) } }
                   SCALAR  { return $server_data{load}                         }
                   VOID    { print "$server_data{load}\n"                      }
                   DEFAULT { croak q{Bad context! No biscuit!}                 }
               );
           }

       The context sequence automatically selects the appropriate block for
       each call context.

   Lazy contextual return values
       "LIST" and "VOID" blocks are always executed during the "return"
       statement. However, scalar return blocks ("SCALAR", "STR", "NUM",
       "BOOL", etc.) blocks are not. Instead, returning any of scalar block
       types causes the subroutine to return an object that lazily evaluates
       that block only when the return value is used.

       This means that returning a "SCALAR" block is a convenient way to
       implement a subroutine with a lazy return value. For example:

           sub digest {
               return SCALAR {
                   my ($text) = @_;
                   md5($text);
               }
           }

           my $digest = digest($text);

           print $digest;   # md5() called only when $digest used as string

       To better document this usage, the "SCALAR" block has a synonym:
       "LAZY".

           sub digest {
               return LAZY {
                   my ($text) = @_;
                   md5($text);
               }
           }

   Active contextual return values
       Once a return value has been lazily evaluated in a given context, the
       resulting value is cached, and thereafter reused in that same context.

       However, you can specify that, rather than being cached, the value
       should be re-evaluated every time the value is used:

            sub make_counter {
               my $counter = 0;
               return ACTIVE
                   SCALAR   { ++$counter }
                   ARRAYREF { [1..$counter] }
           }

           my $idx = make_counter();

           print "$idx\n";      # 1
           print "$idx\n";      # 2
           print "[@$idx]\n";   # [1 2]
           print "$idx\n";      # 3
           print "[@$idx]\n";   # [1 2 3]

   Semi-lazy contextual return values
       Sometimes, single or repeated lazy evaluation of a scalar return value
       in different contexts isn't what you really want. Sometimes what you
       really want is for the return value to be lazily evaluated once only
       (the first time it's used in any context), and then for that first
       value to be reused whenever the return value is subsequently
       reevaluated in any other context.

       To get that behaviour, you can use the "FIXED" modifier, which causes
       the return value to morph itself into the actual value the first time
       it is used. For example:

           sub lazy {
               return
                   SCALAR { 42 }
                   ARRAYREF { [ 1, 2, 3 ] }
               ;
           }

           my $lazy = lazy();
           print $lazy + 1;            # 43
           print "@{$lazy}";           # 1 2 3


           sub semilazy {
               return FIXED
                   SCALAR { 42 }
                   ARRAYREF { [ 1, 2, 3 ] }
               ;
           }

           my $semi = semilazy();
           print $semi + 1;            # 43
           print "@{$semi}";           # die q{Can't use string ("42") as an ARRAY ref}

   Finer distinctions of scalar context
       Because the scalar values returned from a context sequence are lazily
       evaluated, it becomes possible to be more specific about what kind of
       scalar value should be returned: a boolean, a number, or a string. To
       support those distinctions, Contextual::Return provides four extra
       context blocks: "NUM", "STR", "BOOL", and "PUREBOOL":

           sub get_server_status {
               my ($server_ID) = @_;

               # Acquire server data somehow...
               my %server_data = _ascertain_server_status($server_ID);

               # Return different components of that data
               # depending on call context...
               return (
                      LIST { @server_data{ qw(name uptime load users) }          }
                  PUREBOOL { $_ = $server_data{uptime}; $server_data{uptime} > 0 }
                      BOOL { $server_data{uptime} > 0                            }
                      NUM  { $server_data{load}                                  }
                      STR  { "$server_data{name}: $server_data{uptime}"          }
                      VOID { print "$server_data{load}\n"                        }
                   DEFAULT { croak q{Bad context! No biscuit!}                   }
               );
           }

       With these in place, the object returned from a scalar-context call to
       get_server_status() now behaves differently, depending on how it's
       used. For example:

           if ( my $status = get_server_status() ) {  # BOOL: True if uptime > 0
               $load_distribution[$status]++;         # INT:  Evaluates to load value
               print "$status\n";                     # STR:  Prints "name: uptime"
           }

           if (get_server_status()) {                 # PUREBOOL: also sets $_;
               print;                                 # ...which is then used here
           }

       Boolean vs Pure Boolean contexts

       There is a special subset of boolean contexts where the return value is
       being used and immediately thrown away. For example, in the loop:

           while (get_data()) {
               ...
           }

       the value returned by get_data() is tested for truth and then
       discarded.  This is known as "pure boolean context". In contrast, in
       the loop:

           while (my $data = get_data()) {
               ...
           }

       the value returned by get_data() is first assigned to $data, then
       tested for truth. Because of the assignment, the return value is not
       discarded after the boolean test. This is ordinary "boolean context".

       In Perl, pure boolean context is often associated with a special side-
       effect, that does not occur in regular boolean contexts. For example:

           while (<>) {...}         # $_ set as side-effect of pure boolean context

           while ($v = <>) {...}    # $_ NOT set in ordinary boolean context

       Contextual::Return supports this with a special subcase of "BOOL" named
       <PUREBOOL>. In pure boolean contexts, Contextual::Return will call a
       "PUREBOOL" handler if one has been defined, or fall back to a "BOOL" or
       "SCALAR" handler if no "PUREBOOL" handler exists. In ordinary boolean
       contexts only the "BOOL" or "SCALAR" handlers are tried, even if a
       "PUREBOOL" handler is also defined.

       Typically "PUREBOOL" handlers are set up to have some side-effect (most
       commonly: setting $_ or <$@>), like so:

           sub get_data {
               my ($succeeded, @data) = _go_and_get_data();

               return
                   PUREBOOL { $_ = $data[0]; $succeeded; }
                       BOOL {                $succeeded; }
                     SCALAR {                $data[0];   }
                       LIST {                @data;      }
           }

       However, there is no requirement that they have side-effects. For
       example, they can also be used to implement "look-but-don't-retrieve-
       yet" checking:

           sub get_data {
               my $data;
               return
                   PUREBOOL {        _check_for_but_dont_get_data();   }
                       BOOL { defined( $data ||= _go_and_get_data() ); }
                        REF {          $data ||= _go_and_get_data();   }
           }

   Self-reference within handlers
       Any handler can refer to the contextual return object it is part of, by
       calling the RETOBJ() function. This is particularly useful for
       "PUREBOOL" and "LIST" handlers. For example:

           return
               PUREBOOL { $_ = RETOBJ; next handler; }
                   BOOL { !$failed;                  }
                DEFAULT { $data;                     };

   Referential contexts
       The other major kind of scalar return value is a reference.
       Contextual::Return provides contextual return blocks that allow you to
       specify what to (lazily) return when the return value of a subroutine
       is used as a reference to a scalar ("SCALARREF {...}"), to an array
       ("ARRAYREF {...}"), to a hash ("HASHREF {...}"), to a subroutine
       ("CODEREF {...}"), or to a typeglob ("GLOBREF {...}").

       For example, the server status subroutine shown earlier could be
       extended to allow it to return a hash reference, thereby supporting
       "named return values":

           sub get_server_status {
               my ($server_ID) = @_;

               # Acquire server data somehow...
               my %server_data = _ascertain_server_status($server_ID);

               # Return different components of that data
               # depending on call context...
               return (
                      LIST { @server_data{ qw(name uptime load users) }  }
                      BOOL { $server_data{uptime} > 0                    }
                       NUM { $server_data{load}                          }
                       STR { "$server_data{name}: $server_data{uptime}"  }
                      VOID { print "$server_data{load}\n"                }
                   HASHREF { return \%server_data                        }
                   DEFAULT { croak q{Bad context! No biscuit!}           }
               );
           }

           # and later...

           my $users = get_server_status->{users};


           # or, lazily...

           my $server = get_server_status();

           print "$server->{name} load = $server->{load}\n";

   Interpolative referential contexts
       The "SCALARREF {...}" and "ARRAYREF {...}" context blocks are
       especially useful when you need to interpolate a subroutine into
       strings. For example, if you have a subroutine like:

           sub get_todo_tasks {
               return (
                   SCALAR { scalar @todo_list }      # How many?
                   LIST   { @todo_list        }      # What are they?
               );
           }

           # and later...

           print "There are ", scalar(get_todo_tasks()), " tasks:\n",
                   get_todo_tasks();

       then you could make it much easier to interpolate calls to that
       subroutine by adding:

           sub get_todo_tasks {
               return (
                   SCALAR { scalar @todo_list }      # How many?
                   LIST   { @todo_list        }      # What are they?

                   SCALARREF { \scalar @todo_list }  # Ref to how many
                   ARRAYREF  { \@todo_list        }  # Ref to them
               );
           }

           # and then...

           print "There are ${get_todo_tasks()} tasks:\n@{get_todo_tasks()}";

       In fact, this behaviour is so useful that it's the default. If you
       don't provide an explicit "SCALARREF {...}" block, Contextual::Return
       automatically provides an implicit one that simply returns a reference
       to whatever would have been returned in scalar context.  Likewise, if
       no "ARRAYREF {...}" block is specified, the module supplies one that
       returns the list-context return value wrapped up in an array reference.

       So you could just write:

           sub get_todo_tasks {
               return (
                   SCALAR { scalar @todo_list }      # How many?
                   LIST   { @todo_list        }      # What are they?
               );
           }

           # and still do this...

           print "There are ${get_todo_tasks()} tasks:\n@{get_todo_tasks()}";

   Fallback contexts
       As the previous sections imply, the "BOOL {...}", "NUM {...}", "STR
       {...}", and various "*REF {...}" blocks, are special cases of the
       general "SCALAR {...}" context block. If a subroutine is called in one
       of these specialized contexts but does not use the corresponding
       context block, then the more general "SCALAR {...}" block is used
       instead (if it has been specified).

       So, for example:

           sub read_value_from {
               my ($fh) = @_;

               my $value = <$fh>;
               chomp $value;

               return (
                   BOOL   { defined $value }
                   SCALAR { $value         }
               );
           }

       ensures that the read_value_from() subroutine returns true in boolean
       contexts if the read was successful. But, because no specific "NUM
       {...}" or "STR {...}" return behaviours were specified, the subroutine
       falls back on using its generic "SCALAR {...}" block in all other
       scalar contexts.

       Another way to think about this behaviour is that the various kinds of
       scalar context blocks form a hierarchy:

           SCALAR
                ^
                |
                |--< BOOL
                |
                |--< NUM
                |
                `--< STR

       Contextual::Return uses this hierarchical relationship to choose the
       most specific context block available to handle any particular return
       context, working its way up the tree from the specific type it needs,
       to the more general type, if that's all that is available.

       There are two slight complications to this picture. The first is that
       Perl treats strings and numbers as interconvertable so the diagram (and
       the Contextual::Return module) also has to allow these interconversions
       as a fallback strategy:

           SCALAR
                ^
                |
                |--< BOOL
                |
                |--< NUM
                |    : ^
                |    v :
                `--< STR

       The dotted lines are meant to indicate that this intraconversion is
       secondary to the main hierarchical fallback. That is, in a numeric
       context, a "STR {...}" block will only be used if there is no "NUM
       {...}" block and no "SCALAR {...}" block. In other words, the generic
       context type is always used in preference to string<->number
       conversion.

       The second slight complication is that the above diagram only shows a
       small part of the complete hierarchy of contexts supported by
       Contextual::Return. The full fallback hierarchy (including dotted
       interconversions) is:

             DEFAULT
                ^
                |
                |--< VOID
                |
                `--< NONVOID
                        ^
                        |
                        |--< VALUE <...............
                        |      ^                   :
                        |      |                   :
                        |      |--< SCALAR <.......:...
                        |      |           ^           :
                        |      |           |           :
                        |      |           |--< BOOL   :
                        |      |           |     ^     :
                        |      |           |     |     :
                        |      |           |  PUREBOOL :
                        |      |           |           :
                        |      |           |--< NUM <..:.
                        |      |           |    : ^      :
                        |      |           |    v :      :
                        |      |           `--< STR <....:..
                        |      |                           :
                        |      |                          ::
                        |      `--< LIST ................: :
                        |            : ^                   :
                        |            : :                   :
                        `--- REF     : :                   :
                              ^      : :                   :
                              |      v :                   :
                              |--< ARRAYREF                :
                              |                            :
                              |--< SCALARREF .............:
                              |
                              |--< HASHREF
                              |
                              |--< CODEREF
                              |
                              |--< GLOBREF
                              |
                              `--< OBJREF <....... METHOD
                                      ^
                                      :........... BLESSED

       As before, each dashed arrow represents a fallback relationship. That
       is, if the required context specifier isn't available, the arrows are
       followed until a more generic one is found. The dotted arrows again
       represent the interconversion of return values, which is attempted only
       after the normal hierarchical fallback fails.

       For example, if a subroutine is called in a context that expects a
       scalar reference, but no "SCALARREF {...}" block is provided, then
       Contextual::Return tries the following blocks in order:

               REF {...}
           NONVOID {...}
           DEFAULT {...}
               STR {...} (automatically taking a reference to the result)
               NUM {...} (automatically taking a reference to the result)
            SCALAR {...} (automatically taking a reference to the result)
             VALUE {...} (automatically taking a reference to the result)

       Likewise, in a list context, if there is no "LIST {...}" context block,
       the module tries:

              VALUE {...}
            NONVOID {...}
            DEFAULT {...}
           ARRAYREF {...} (automatically dereferencing the result)
                STR {...} (treating it as a list of one element)
                NUM {...} (treating it as a list of one element)
             SCALAR {...} (treating it as a list of one element)

       The more generic context blocks are especially useful for intercepting
       unexpected and undesirable call contexts. For example, to turn off the
       automatic scalar-ref and array-ref interpolative behaviour described in
       "Interpolative referential contexts", you could intercept all
       referential contexts using a generic "REF {...}" context block:

           sub get_todo_tasks {
               return (
                   SCALAR { scalar @todo_list }      # How many?
                   LIST   { @todo_list        }      # What are they?

                   REF { croak q{get_todo_task() can't be used as a reference} }
               );
           }

           print 'There are ', get_todo_tasks(), '...';    # Still okay
           print "There are ${get_todo_tasks()}...";       # Throws an exception

   Treating return values as objects
       Normally, when a return value is treated as an object (i.e. has a
       method called on it), Contextual::Return invokes any "OBJREF" handler
       that was specified in the contextual return list, and delegates the
       method call to the object returned by that handler.

       However, you can also be more specific, by specifying a "METHOD"
       context handler in the contextual return list. The block of this
       handler is expected to return one or more method-name/method-handler
       pairs, like so:

           return
               METHOD {
                   get_count => sub { my $n = shift; $data[$n]{count} },
                   get_items => sub { my $n = shift; $data[$n]{items} },
                   clear     => sub { @data = (); },
                   reset     => sub { @data = (); },
               }

       Then, whenever one of the specified methods is called on the return
       value, the corresponding subroutine will be called to implement it.

       The method handlers must always be subroutine references, but the
       method-name specifiers may be strings (as in the previous example) or
       they may be specified generically, as either regexes or array
       references. Generic method names are used to call the same handler for
       two or more distinct method names.  For example, the previous example
       could be simplified to:

           return
               METHOD {
                   qr/get_(\w+)/     => sub { my $n = shift; $data[$n]{$1} },
                   ['clear','reset'] => sub { @data = (); },
               }

       A method name specified by regex will invoke the corresponding handler
       for any method call request that the regex matches. A method name
       specified by array ref will invoke the corresponding handler if the
       method requested matches any of the elements of the array (which may
       themselves be strings or regexes).

       When the method handler is invoked, the name of the method requested is
       passed to the handler in $_, and the method's argument list is passed
       (as usual) via @_.

       Note that any methods not explicitly handled by the "METHOD" handlers
       will still be delegated to the object returned by the "OBJREF" handler
       (if it is also specified).

   Not treating return values as objects
       The use of "OBJREF" and "METHOD" are slightly complicated by the fact
       that contextual return values are themselves objects.

       For example, prior to version 0.4.4 of the module, if you passed a
       contextual return value to Scalar::Util::blessed(), it always returned
       a true value (namely, the string: 'Contextual::Return::Value'), even if
       the return value had not specified handlers for "OBJREF" or "METHOD".

       In other words, the implementation of contextual return values (as
       objects) was getting in the way of the use of contextual return values
       (as non-objects).

       So the module now also provides a "BLESSED" handler, which allows you
       to explicitly control how contextual return values interact with
       Scalar::Util::blessed().

       If $crv is a contextual return value, by default
       Scalar::Util::blessed($crv) will now only return true if that return
       value has a "OBJREF", "LAZY", "REF", "SCALAR", "VALUE", "NONVOID", or
       "DEFAULT" handler that in turn returns a blessed object.

       However if $crv also provides a "BLESSED" handler, blessed() will
       return whatever that handler returns.

       This means:

           sub simulate_non_object {
               return BOOL { 1 }
                       NUM { 42 }
           }

           sub simulate_real_object {
               return OBJREF { bless {}, 'My::Class' }
                        BOOL { 1 }
                         NUM { 42 }
           }

           sub simulate_faked_object {
               return BLESSED { 'Foo' }
                         BOOL { 1 }
                          NUM { 42 }
           }

           sub simulate_previous_behaviour {
               return BLESSED { 'Contextual::Return::Value' }
                         BOOL { 1 }
                          NUM { 42 }
           }


           say blessed( simulate_non_object()         );   # undef
           say blessed( simulate_real_object()        );   # My::Class
           say blessed( simulate_faked_object()       );   # Foo
           say blessed( simulate_previous_behaviour() );   # Contextual::Return::Value

       Typically, you either want no "BLESSED" handler (in which case
       contextual return values pretend not to be blessed objects), or you
       want "BLESSED { 'Contextual::Return::Value' }" for backwards
       compatibility with pre-v0.4.7 behaviour.

       Preventing fallbacks

       Sometimes fallbacks can be too helpful. Or sometimes you want to impose
       strict type checking on a return value.

       Contextual::Returns allows that via the "STRICT" specifier. If you
       include "STRICT" anywhere in your return statement, the module disables
       all fallbacks and will therefore through an exception if the return
       value is used in any way not explicitly specified in the contextual
       return sequence.

       For example, to create a subroutine that returns only a string:

           sub get_name {
               return STRICT STR { 'Bruce' }
           }

       If the return value of the subroutine is used in any other way than as
       a string, an exception will be thrown.

       You can still specify handlers for more than a single kind of context
       when using "STRICT":

           sub get_name {
               return STRICT
                   STR  { 'Bruce' }
                   BOOL { 0 }
           }

       ...but these will still be the only contexts in which the return value
       can be used:

           my $n = get_name() ? 1 : 2;  # Okay because BOOL handler specified

           my $n = 'Dr' . get_name();   # Okay because STR handler specified

           my $n = 1 + get_name();      # Exception thrown because no NUM handler

       In other words, "STRICT" allows you to impose strict type checking on
       your contextual return value.

   Deferring handlers
       Because the various handlers form a hierarchy, it's possible to
       implement more specific handlers by falling back on ("deferring to")
       more general ones. For example, a "PUREBOOL" handler is almost always
       identical in its basic behaviour to the corresponding "BOOL" handler,
       except that it adds some side-effect.  For example:

           return
               PUREBOOL { $_ = $return_val; defined $return_val && $return_val > 0 }
                   BOOL {                   defined $return_val && $return_val > 0 }
                 SCALAR {                   $return_val;                           }

       So Contextual::Return allows you to have a handler perform some action
       and then defer to a more general handler to supply the actual return
       value. To fall back to a more general case in this way, you simply
       write:

           next handler;

       at the end of the handler in question, after which Contextual::Return
       will find the next-most-specific handler and execute it as well. So the
       previous example, could be re-written:

           return
               PUREBOOL { $_ = $return_val; next handler;        }
                   BOOL { defined $return_val && $return_val > 0 }
                 SCALAR { $return_val;                           }

       Note that any specific handler can defer to a more general one in this
       same way. For example, you could provide consistent and maintainable
       type-checking for a subroutine that returns references by providing
       "ARRAYREF", "HASHREF", and "SCALARREF" handlers that all defer to a
       generic "REF" handler, like so:

           my $retval = _get_ref();

           return
              SCALARREF { croak 'Type mismatch' if ref($retval) ne 'SCALAR';
                          next handler;
                        }
               ARRAYREF { croak 'Type mismatch' if ref($retval) ne 'ARRAY';
                          next handler;
                        }
                HASHREF { croak 'Type mismatch' if ref($retval) ne 'HASH';
                          next handler;
                        }
                    REF { $retval }

       If, at a later time, the process of returning a reference became more
       complex, only the "REF" handler would have to be updated.

   Nested handlers
       Another way of factoring out return behaviour is to nest more specific
       handlers inside more general ones. For instance, in the final example
       given in "Boolean vs Pure Boolean contexts":

           sub get_data {
               my $data;
               return
                   PUREBOOL {        _check_for_but_dont_get_data();   }
                       BOOL { defined( $data ||= _go_and_get_data() ); }
                        REF {          $data ||= _go_and_get_data();   }
           }

       you could factor out the repeated calls to _go_and_get_data() like so:

           sub get_data {
               return
                   PUREBOOL { _check_for_but_dont_get_data(); }
                    DEFAULT {
                       my $data = _go_and_get_data();

                       BOOL { defined $data; }
                        REF {         $data; }
                    }
           }

       Here, the "DEFAULT" handler deals with every return context except pure
       boolean. Within that "DEFAULT" handler, the data is first retrieved,
       and then two "sub-handlers" deal with the ordinary boolean and
       referential contexts.

       Typically nested handlers are used in precisely this way: to optimize
       for inexpensive special cases (such as pure boolean or integer or void
       return contexts) and only do extra work for those other cases that
       require it.

   Failure contexts
       Two of the most common ways to specify that a subroutine has failed are
       to return a false value, or to throw an exception. The
       Contextual::Return module provides a mechanism that allows the
       subroutine writer to support both of these mechanisms at the same time,
       by using the "FAIL" specifier.

       A return statement of the form:

           return FAIL;

       causes the surrounding subroutine to return "undef" (i.e. false) in
       boolean contexts, and to throw an exception in any other context. For
       example:

           use Contextual::Return;

           sub get_next_val {
               my $next_val = <>;
               return FAIL if !defined $next_val;
               chomp $next_val;
               return $next_val;
           }

       If the "return FAIL" statement is executed, it will either return false
       in a boolean context:

           if (my $val = get_next_val()) {      # returns undef if no next val
               print "[$val]\n";
           }

       or else throw an exception if the return value is used in any other
       context:

           print get_next_val();       # throws exception if no next val

           my $next_val = get_next_val();
           print "[$next_val]\n";      # throws exception if no next val

       The exception that is thrown is of the form:

           Call to main::get_next_val() failed at demo.pl line 42

       but you can change that message by providing a block to the "FAIL",
       like so:

           return FAIL { "No more data" } if !defined $next_val;

       in which case, the final value of the block becomes the exception
       message:

           No more data at demo.pl line 42

       A failure value can be interrogated for its error message, by calling
       its error() method, like so:

           my $val = get_next_val();
           if ($val) {
               print "[$val]\n";
           }
           else {
               print $val->error, "\n";
           }

   Configurable failure contexts
       The default "FAIL" behaviour--false in boolean context, fatal in all
       others--works well in most situations, but violates the Platinum Rule
       ("Do unto others as they would have done unto them").

       So it may be user-friendlier if the user of a module is allowed decide
       how the module's subroutines should behave on failure. For example, one
       user might prefer that failing subs always return undef; another might
       prefer that they always throw an exception; a third might prefer that
       they always log the problem and return a special Failure object; whilst
       a fourth user might want to get back 0 in scalar contexts, an empty
       list in list contexts, and an exception everywhere else.

       You could create a module that allows the user to specify all these
       alternatives, like so:

           package MyModule;
           use Contextual::Return;
           use Log::StdLog;

           sub import {
               my ($package, @args) = @_;

               Contextual::Return::FAIL_WITH {
                   ':false' => sub { return undef },
                   ':fatal' => sub { croak @_       },
                   ':filed' => sub {
                                   print STDLOG 'Sub ', (caller 1)[3], ' failed';
                                   return Failure->new();
                               },
                   ':fussy' => sub {
                                   SCALAR  { undef      }
                                   LIST    { ()         }
                                   DEFAULT { croak @_ }
                               },
               }, @args;
           }

       This configures Contextual::Return so that, instead of the usual false-
       or-fatal semantics, every "return FAIL" within MyModule's namespace is
       implemented by one of the four subroutines specified in the hash that
       was passed to "FAIL_WITH".

       Which of those four subs implements the "FAIL" is determined by the
       arguments passed after the hash (i.e. by the contents of @args).
       "FAIL_WITH" walks through that list of arguments and compares them
       against the keys of the hash. If a key matches an argument, the
       corresponding value is used as the implementation of "FAIL". Note that,
       if subsequent arguments also match a key, their subroutine overrides
       the previously installed implementation, so only the final override has
       any effect. Contextual::Return generates warnings when multiple
       overrides are specified.

       All of which mean that, if a user loaded the MyModule module like this:

           use MyModule qw( :fatal other args here );

       then every "FAIL" within MyModule would be reconfigured to throw an
       exception in all circumstances, since the presence of the ':fatal' in
       the argument list will cause "FAIL_WITH" to select the hash entry whose
       key is ':fatal'.

       On the other hand, if they loaded the module:

           use MyModule qw( :fussy other args here );

       then each "FAIL" within MyModule would return undef or empty list or
       throw an exception, depending on context, since that's what the
       subroutine whose key is ':fussy' does.

       Many people prefer module interfaces with a "flag => value" format, and
       "FAIL_WITH" supports this too. For example, if you wanted your module
       to take a "-fail" flag, whose associated value could be any of
       "undefined", "exception", "logged", or "context", then you could
       implement that simply by specifying the flag as the first argument
       (i.e. before the hash) like so:

           sub import {
               my $package = shift;

               Contextual::Return::FAIL_WITH -fail => {
                   'undefined' => sub { return undef },
                   'exception' => sub { croak @_ },
                   'logged'    => sub {
                                   print STDLOG 'Sub ', (caller 1)[3], ' failed';
                                   return Failure->new();
                               },
                   'context' => sub {
                                   SCALAR  { undef      }
                                   LIST    { ()         }
                                   DEFAULT { croak @_ }
                               },
               }, @_;

       and then load the module:

           use MyModule qw( other args here ), -fail=>'undefined';

       or:

           use MyModule qw( other args here ), -fail=>'exception';

       In this case, "FAIL_WITH" scans the argument list for a pair of values:
       its flag string, followed by some other selector value. Then it looks
       up the selector value in the hash, and installs the corresponding
       subroutine as its local "FAIL" handler.

       If this "flagged" interface is used, the user of the module can also
       specify their own handler directly, by passing a subroutine reference
       as the selector value instead of a string:

           use MyModule qw( other args here ), -fail=>sub{ die 'horribly'};

       If this last example were used, any call to "FAIL" within MyModule
       would invoke the specified anonymous subroutine (and hence throw a
       'horribly' exception).

       Note that, any overriding of a "FAIL" handler is specific to the
       namespace and file from which the subroutine that calls "FAIL_WITH" is
       itself called. Since "FAIL_WITH" is designed to be called from within a
       module's import() subroutine, that generally means that the "FAIL"s
       within a given module X are only overridden for the current namespace
       within the particular file from module X is loaded. This means that two
       separate pieces of code (in separate files or separate namespaces) can
       each independently override a module's "FAIL" behaviour, without
       interfering with each other.

   Lvalue contexts
       Recent versions of Perl offer (limited) support for lvalue subroutines:
       subroutines that return a modifiable variable, rather than a simple
       constant value.

       Contextual::Return can make it easier to create such subroutines,
       within the limitations imposed by Perl itself. The limitations that
       Perl places on lvalue subs are:

       1.  The subroutine must be declared with an ":lvalue" attribute:

               sub foo :lvalue {...}

       2.  The subroutine must not return via an explicit "return". Instead,
           the last statement must evaluate to a variable, or must be a call
           to another lvalue subroutine call.

               my ($foo, $baz);

               sub foo :lvalue {
                   $foo;               # last statement evals to a var
               }

               sub bar :lvalue {
                   foo();              # last statement is lvalue sub call
               }

               sub baz :lvalue {
                   my ($arg) = @_;

                   $arg > 0            # last statement evals...
                       ? $baz          # ...to a var
                       : bar();        # ...or to an lvalue sub call
               }

       Thereafter, any call to the lvalue subroutine produces a result that
       can be assigned to:

           baz(0) = 42;            # same as: $baz = 42

           baz(1) = 84;            # same as:                  bar() = 84
                                   #  which is the same as:    foo() = 84
                                   #   which is the same as:   $foo  = 84

       Ultimately, every lvalue subroutine must return a scalar variable,
       which is then used as the lvalue of the assignment (or whatever other
       lvalue operation is applied to the subroutine call). Unfortunately,
       because the subroutine has to return this variable before the
       assignment can take place, there is no way that a normal lvalue
       subroutine can get access to the value that will eventually be assigned
       to its return value.

       This is occasionally annoying, so the Contextual::Return module offers
       a solution: in addition to all the context blocks described above, it
       provides three special contextual return blocks specifically for use in
       lvalue subroutines: "LVALUE", "RVALUE", and "NVALUE".

       Using these blocks you can specify what happens when an lvalue
       subroutine is used in lvalue and non-lvalue (rvalue) context. For
       example:

           my $verbosity_level = 1;

           # Verbosity values must be between 0 and 5...
           sub verbosity :lvalue {
               LVALUE { $verbosity_level = max(0, min($_, 5)) }
               RVALUE { $verbosity_level                      }
           }

       The "LVALUE" block is executed whenever "verbosity" is called as an
       lvalue:

           verbosity() = 7;

       The block has access to the value being assigned, which is passed to it
       as $_. So, in the above example, the assigned value of 7 would be
       aliased to $_ within the "LVALUE" block, would be reduced to 5 by the
       "min-of-max" expression, and then assigned to $verbosity_level.

       (If you need to access the caller's $_, it's also still available: as
       $CALLER::_.)

       When the subroutine isn't used as an lvalue:

           print verbosity();

       the "RVALUE" block is executed instead and its final value returned.
       Within an "RVALUE" block you can use any of the other features of
       Contextual::Return. For example:

           sub verbosity :lvalue {
               LVALUE { $verbosity_level = int max(0, min($_, 5)) }
               RVALUE {
                   NUM  { $verbosity_level               }
                   STR  { $description[$verbosity_level] }
                   BOOL { $verbosity_level > 2           }
               }
           }

       but the context sequence must be nested inside an "RVALUE" block.

       You can also specify what an lvalue subroutine should do when it is
       used neither as an lvalue nor as an rvalue (i.e. in void context), by
       using an "NVALUE" block:

           sub verbosity :lvalue {
               my ($level) = @_;

               NVALUE { $verbosity_level = int max(0, min($level, 5)) }
               LVALUE { $verbosity_level = int max(0, min($_,     5)) }
               RVALUE {
                   NUM  { $verbosity_level               }
                   STR  { $description[$verbosity_level] }
                   BOOL { $verbosity_level > 2           }
               }
           }

       In this example, a call to verbosity() in void context sets the
       verbosity level to whatever argument is passed to the subroutine:

           verbosity(1);

       Note that you cannot get the same effect by nesting a "VOID" block
       within an "RVALUE" block:

               LVALUE { $verbosity_level = int max(0, min($_, 5)) }
               RVALUE {
                   NUM  { $verbosity_level               }
                   STR  { $description[$verbosity_level] }
                   BOOL { $verbosity_level > 2           }
                   VOID { $verbosity_level = $level      }  # Wrong!
               }

       That's because, in a void context the return value is never evaluated,
       so it is never treated as an rvalue, which means the "RVALUE" block
       never executes.

   Result blocks
       Occasionally, it's convenient to calculate a return value before the
       end of a contextual return block. For example, you may need to clean up
       external resources involved in the calculation after it's complete.
       Typically, this requirement produces a slightly awkward code sequence
       like this:

           return
               VALUE {
                   $db->start_work();
                   my $result = $db->retrieve_query($query);
                   $db->commit();
                   $result;
               }

       Such code sequences become considerably more awkward when you want the
       return value to be context sensitive, in which case you have to write
       either:

           return
               LIST {
                   $db->start_work();
                   my @result = $db->retrieve_query($query);
                   $db->commit();
                   @result;
               }
               SCALAR {
                   $db->start_work();
                   my $result = $db->retrieve_query($query);
                   $db->commit();
                   $result;
               }

       or, worse:

           return
               VALUE {
                   $db->start_work();
                   my $result = LIST ? [$db->retrieve_query($query)]
                                     :  $db->retrieve_query($query);
                   $db->commit();
                   LIST ? @{$result} : $result;
               }

       To avoid these infelicities, Contextual::Return provides a second way
       of setting the result of a context block; a way that doesn't require
       that the result be the last statement in the block:

           return
               LIST {
                   $db->start_work();
                   RESULT { $db->retrieve_query($query) };
                   $db->commit();
               }
               SCALAR {
                   $db->start_work();
                   RESULT { $db->retrieve_query($query) };
                   $db->commit();
               }

       The presence of a "RESULT" block inside a contextual return block
       causes that block to return the value of the final statement of the
       "RESULT" block as the handler's return value, rather than returning the
       value of the handler's own final statement. In other words, the
       presence of a "RESULT" block overrides the normal return value of a
       context handler.

       Better still, the "RESULT" block always evaluates its final statement
       in the same context as the surrounding "return", so you can just write:

           return
               VALUE {
                   $db->start_work();
                   RESULT { $db->retrieve_query($query) };
                   $db->commit();
               }

       and the retrieve_query() method will be called in the appropriate
       context in all cases.

       A "RESULT" block can appear anywhere inside any contextual return
       block, but may not be used outside a context block. That is, this is an
       error:

           if ($db->closed) {
               RESULT { undef }; # Error: not in a context block
           }
           return
               VALUE {
                   $db->start_work();
                   RESULT { $db->retrieve_query($query) };
                   $db->commit();
               }

   Post-handler clean-up
       If a subroutine uses an external resource, it's often necessary to
       close or clean-up that resource after the subroutine ends...regardless
       of whether the subroutine exits normally or via an exception.

       Typically, this is done by encapsulating the resource in a lexically
       scoped object whose destructor does the clean-up. However, if the
       clean-up doesn't involve deallocation of an object (as in the
       "$db->commit()" example in the previous section), it can be annoying to
       have to create a class and allocate a container object, merely to
       mediate the clean-up.

       To make it easier to manage such resources, Contextual::Return supplies
       a special labelled block: the "RECOVER" block. If a "RECOVER" block is
       specified as part of a contextual return sequence, that block is
       executed after any context handler, even if the context handler exits
       via an exception.

       So, for example, you could implement a simple commit-or-revert policy
       like so:

           return
               LIST    { $db->retrieve_all($query)  }
               SCALAR  { $db->retrieve_next($query) }
               RECOVER {
                   if ($@) {
                       $db->revert();
                   }
                   else {
                       $db->commit();
                   }
               }

       The presence of a "RECOVER" block also intercepts all exceptions thrown
       in any other context block in the same contextual return sequence. Any
       such exception is passed into the "RECOVER" block in the usual manner:
       via the $@ variable. The exception may be rethrown out of the "RECOVER"
       block by calling "die":

           return
               LIST    { $db->retrieve_all($query) }
               DEFAULT { croak "Invalid call (not in list context)" }
               RECOVER {
                   die $@ if $@;    # Propagate any exception
                   $db->commit();   # Otherwise commit the changes
               }

       A "RECOVER" block can also access or replace the returned value, by
       invoking a "RESULT" block. For example:

           return
               LIST    { attempt_to_generate_list_for(@_)  }
               SCALAR  { attempt_to_generate_count_for(@_) }
               RECOVER {
                   if ($@) {                # On any exception...
                       warn "Replacing return value. Previously: ", RESULT;
                       RESULT { undef }     # ...return undef
                   }
               }

   Post-return clean-up
       Occasionally it's necessary to defer the clean-up of resources until
       after the return value has been used. Once again, this is usually done
       by returning an object with a suitable destructor.

       Using Contextual::Return you can get the same effect, by providing a
       "CLEANUP" block in the contextual return sequence:

           return
               LIST    { $db->retrieve_all($query)  }
               SCALAR  { $db->retrieve_next($query) }
               CLEANUP { $db->commit()              }

       In this example, the "commit" method call is only performed after the
       return value has been used by the caller. Note that this is quite
       different from using a "RECOVER" block, which is called as the
       subroutine returns its value; a "CLEANUP" is called when the returned
       value is garbage collected.

       A "CLEANUP" block is useful for controlling resources allocated to
       support an "ACTIVE" return value. For example:

           my %file;

           # Return an active value that is always the next line from a file...
           sub readline_from {
               my ($file_name) = @_;

               # Open the file, if not already open...
               if (!$file{$file_name}) {
                   open $file{$file_name}{handle}, '<', $file_name;
               }

               # Track how many active return values are using this file...
               $file{$file_name}{count}++;

               return ACTIVE
                   # Evaluating the return value returns the next line...
                   VALUE   { readline $file{$file_name}{handle} }

                   # Once the active value is finished with, clean up the filehandle...
                   CLEANUP {
                       delete $file{$file_name}
                           if --$file{$file_name}{count} == 0;
                   }
           }

   Debugging contextual return values
       Contextual return values are implemented as opaque objects (using the
       "inside-out" technique). This means that passing such values to
       Data::Dumper produces an uninformative output like:

           $VAR1 = bless( do{\(my $o = undef)}, 'Contextual::Return::Value' );

       So the module provides two methods that allow contextual return values
       to be correctly reported: either directly, or when dumped by
       Data::Dumper.

       To dump a contextual return value directly, call the module's DUMP()
       method explicitly and print the result:

           print $crv->Contextual::Return::DUMP();

       This produces an output something like:

           [
            { FROM       => 'main::foo'                                       },
            { NO_HANDLER => [ 'VOID', 'CODEREF', 'HASHREF', 'GLOBREF' ]       },
            { FALLBACKS  => [ 'VALUE' ]                                       },
            { LIST       => [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ]                 },
            { STR        => '<<<Throws exception: Died at demo.pl line 7.>>>' },
            { NUM        => 42                                                },
            { BOOL       => -1                                                },
            { SCALARREF  => '<<<self-reference>>>'                            },
            { ARRAYREF   => [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ]                 },
           ];

       The "FROM" hash entry names the subroutine that produced the return
       value. The "NO_HANDLER" hash entry lists those contexts for which no
       handler was defined (and which would therefore normally produce "can't
       call" exceptions such as: "Can't call main::foo in VOID context").  The
       "FALLBACKS" hash entry lists any "generic" contexts such as "VALUE",
       "NONVOID", "REF", "DEFAULT", etc. that the contextual return value can
       also handle. After these, all the remaining hash entries are actual
       contexts in which the return value could successfully be evaluated, and
       the value it would produce in each of those contexts.

       The Data::Dumper module also has a mechanism by which you can tell it
       how to produce a similar listing automatically whenever a contextual
       return value is passed to its "Dumper" method. Data::Dumper allows you
       to register a "freezer" method, that is called prior to dumping, and
       which can be used to adapt an opaque object to make it dumpable.
       Contextual::Return provides just such a method
       (Contextual::Return::FREEZE()) for you to register, like so:

           use Data::Dumper 'Dumper';

           local $Data::Dumper::Freezer = 'Contextual::Return::FREEZE';

           print Dumper $foo;

       The output is then precisely the same as Contextual::Return::DUMP()
       would produce.

       Note that, with both of the above dumping mechanisms, it is essential
       to use the full name of the method. That is:

           print $crv->Contextual::Return::DUMP();

       rather than:

           print $crv->DUMP();

       This is because the shorter version is interpreted as calling the
       DUMP() method on the object returned by the return value's "OBJREF"
       context block (see "Scalar reference contexts")

       For the same reason, you must write:

           local $Data::Dumper::Freezer = 'Contextual::Return::FREEZE';

       not:

           local $Data::Dumper::Freezer = 'FREEZE';

   Namespace controls
       By default the module exports a large number of return context markers:

           DEFAULT    REF          LAZY
           VOID       SCALARREF    FIXED
           NONVOID    ARRAYREF     ACTIVE
           LIST       CODEREF      RESULT
           SCALAR     HASHREF      RECOVER
           VALUE      GLOBREF      CLEANUP
           STR        OBJREF       RVALUE
           NUM        METHOD       LVALUE
           BOOL                    NVALUE
           PUREBOOL

       These are exported as subroutines, and so can conflict with existing
       subroutines in your namespace, or with subroutines imported from other
       modules.

       Contextual::Return allows you to control which contextual return blocks
       are exported into any namespace that uses the module. It also allows
       you to rename blocks to avoid namespace conflicts with existing
       subroutines.

       Both these features are controlled by passing arguments to the "use"
       statement that loads the module as follows:

       •   Any string passed as an argument to "use Contextual::Return",
           exports only the block name it specifies;

       •   Any regex passed as an argument to "use Contextual::Return" exports
           every block name it matches;

       •   Any array ref (recursively) exports each of its elements

       •   Any string that appears immediately after one of the above three
           specifiers, and which is not itself a block name, renames the
           handlers exported by that preceding specifier by filtering each
           handler name through sprintf()

       That is, you can specify handlers to be exported by exact name (as a
       string), by general pattern (as a regex), or collectively (in an
       array). And after any of these export specifications, you can append a
       template in which any '%s' will be replaced by the original name of the
       handler. For example:

           # Selectively export specific sets of handlers...
           use Contextual::Return  qr/[NLR]VALUE/;
           use Contextual::Return  qr/.*REF/;

           # Selective export specific sets and add a suffix to each...
           use Contextual::Return  qr/[NLR]VALUE/ => '%s_CONTEXT';

           # Selective export specific sets and add a prefix to each...
           use Contextual::Return  qr/.*REF/ => 'CR_%s';

           # Export a list of handlers...
           use Contextual::Return    'NUM', 'STR', 'BOOL' ;
           use Contextual::Return qw< NUM    STR    BOOL >;
           use Contextual::Return   ['NUM', 'STR', 'BOOL'];

           # Export a list of handlers, renaming them individually...
           use Contextual::Return  NUM => 'NUMERIC', STR => 'TEXT', BOOL => 'CR_%s';

           # Export a list of handlers, renaming them collectively...
           use Contextual::Return  ['NUM', 'STR', 'BOOL'] => '%s_CONTEXT';

           # Mixed exports and renames...
           use Contextual::Return (
               STR => 'TEXT',
               ['NUM', 'BOOL'] => 'CR_%s',
               ['LIST', 'SCALAR', 'VOID', qr/^[NLR]VALUE/] => '%s_CONTEXT',
           );

INTERFACE
   Context tests
       LIST()
           Returns true if the current subroutine was called in list context.
           A cleaner way of writing: wantarray()

       SCALAR()
           Returns true if the current subroutine was called in scalar
           context.  A cleaner way of writing: "defined wantarray() && !
           wantarray()"

       VOID()
           Returns true if the current subroutine was called in void context.
           A cleaner way of writing: "!defined wantarray()"

       NONVOID()
           Returns true if the current subroutine was called in list or scalar
           context.  A cleaner way of writing: "defined wantarray()"

   Standard contexts
       "LIST {...}"
           The block specifies what the context sequence should evaluate to
           when called in list context.

       "SCALAR {...}"
           The block specifies what the context sequence should evaluate to in
           scalar contexts, unless some more-specific specifier scalar context
           specifier (see below) also occurs in the same context sequence.

       "VOID {...}"
           The block specifies what the context sequence should do when called
           in void context.

   Scalar value contexts
       "BOOL {...}"
           The block specifies what the context sequence should evaluate to
           when treated as a boolean value.

       "NUM {...}"
           The block specifies what the context sequence should evaluate to
           when treated as a numeric value.

       "STR {...}"
           The block specifies what the context sequence should evaluate to
           when treated as a string value.

       "LAZY {...}"
           Another name for "SCALAR {...}". Usefully self-documenting when the
           primary purpose of the contextual return is to defer evaluation of
           the return value until it's actually required.

   Scalar reference contexts
       "SCALARREF {...}"
           The block specifies what the context sequence should evaluate to
           when treated as a reference to a scalar.

       "ARRAYREF {...}"
           The block specifies what the context sequence should evaluate to
           when treated as a reference to an array.

       "HASHREF {...}"
           The block specifies what the context sequence should evaluate to
           when treated as a reference to a hash.

           Note that a common error here is to write:

           HASHREF { a=>1, b=>2, c=>3 }

           The curly braces there are a block, not a hash constructor, so the
           block doesn't return a hash reference and the interpreter throws an
           exception.  What's needed is:

           HASHREF { {a=>1, b=>2, c=>3} }

           in which the inner braces are a hash constructor.

       "CODEREF {...}"
           The block specifies what the context sequence should evaluate to
           when treated as a reference to a subroutine.

       "GLOBREF {...}"
           The block specifies what the context sequence should evaluate to
           when treated as a reference to a typeglob.

       "OBJREF {...}"
           The block specifies what the context sequence should evaluate to
           when treated as a reference to an object.

       "METHOD {...}"
           The block can be used to specify particular handlers for specific
           method calls when the return value is treated as an object
           reference.  It should return a list of methodname/methodbody pairs.
           Each method name can be specified as a string, a regex, or an array
           of strings or regexes. The method bodies must be specified as
           subroutine references (usually anonymous subs). The first method
           name that matches the actual method call selects the corresponding
           handler, which is then called.

   Generic contexts
       "VALUE {...}"
           The block specifies what the context sequence should evaluate to
           when treated as a non-referential value (as a boolean, numeric,
           string, scalar, or list). Only used if there is no more-specific
           value context specifier in the context sequence.

       "REF {...}"
           The block specifies what the context sequence should evaluate to
           when treated as a reference of any kind. Only used if there is no
           more-specific referential context specifier in the context
           sequence.

       "NONVOID {...}"
           The block specifies what the context sequence should evaluate to
           when used in a non-void context of any kind. Only used if there is
           no more-specific context specifier in the context sequence.

       "DEFAULT {...}"
           The block specifies what the context sequence should evaluate to
           when used in a void or non-void context of any kind. Only used if
           there is no more-specific context specifier in the context
           sequence.

   Failure context
       "FAIL"
           This block is executed unconditionally and is used to indicate
           failure. In a Boolean context it return false. In all other
           contexts it throws an exception consisting of the final evaluated
           value of the block.

           That is, using "FAIL":

           return FAIL { "Could not defenestrate the widget" }

           is exactly equivalent to writing:

           return BOOL { 0 } DEFAULT { croak "Could not defenestrate the
           widget" }

           except that the reporting of errors is a little smarter under
           "FAIL".

           If "FAIL" is called without specifying a block:

           return FAIL;

           it is equivalent to:

           return FAIL { croak "Call to <subname> failed" }

           (where "<subname>" is replaced with the name of the surrounding
           subroutine).

           Note that, because "FAIL" implicitly covers every possible return
           context, it cannot be chained with other context specifiers.

       "Contextual::Return::FAIL_WITH"
           This subroutine is not exported, but may be called directly to
           reconfigure "FAIL" behaviour in the caller's namespace.

           The subroutine is called with an optional string (the flag),
           followed by a mandatory hash reference (the configurations hash),
           followed by a list of zero-or-more strings (the selector list). The
           values of the configurations hash must all be subroutine
           references.

           If the optional flag is specified, "FAIL_WITH" searches the
           selector list looking for that string, then uses the following item
           in the selector list as its selector value. If that selector value
           is a string, "FAIL_WITH" looks up that key in the hash, and
           installs the corresponding subroutine as the namespace's "FAIL"
           handler (an exception is thrown if the selector string is not a
           valid key of the configurations hash). If the selector value is a
           subroutine reference, "FAIL_WITH" installs that subroutine as the
           "FAIL" handler.

           If the optional flag is not specified, "FAIL_WITH" searches the
           entire selector list looking for the last element that matches any
           key in the configurations hash. It then looks up that key in the
           hash, and installs the corresponding subroutine as the namespace's
           "FAIL" handler.

           See "Configurable failure contexts" for examples of using this
           feature.

   Lvalue contexts
       "LVALUE"
           This block is executed when the result of an ":lvalue" subroutine
           is assigned to. The assigned value is passed to the block as $_. To
           access the caller's $_ value, use $CALLER::_.

       "RVALUE"
           This block is executed when the result of an ":lvalue" subroutine
           is used as an rvalue. The final value that is evaluated in the
           block becomes the rvalue.

       "NVALUE"
           This block is executed when an ":lvalue" subroutine is evaluated in
           void context.

   Explicit result blocks
       "RESULT"
           This block may only appear inside a context handler block. It
           causes the surrounding handler to return the final value of the
           "RESULT"'s block, rather than the final value of the handler's own
           block. This override occurs regardless of the location to the
           "RESULT" block within the handler.

           If called without a trailing "{...}", it simply returns the current
           result value in scalar contexts, or the list of result values in
           list context.

   Recovery blocks
       "RECOVER"
           If present in a context return sequence, this block grabs control
           after any context handler returns or exits via an exception. If an
           exception was thrown it is passed to the "RECOVER" block via the $@
           variable.

   Clean-up blocks
       "CLEANUP"
           If present in a context return sequence, this block grabs control
           when a return value is garbage collected.

   Modifiers
       "FIXED"
           This specifies that the scalar value will only be evaluated once,
           the first time it is used, and that the value will then morph into
           that evaluated value.

       "ACTIVE"
           This specifies that the scalar value's originating block will be
           re- evaluated every time the return value is used.

   Debugging support
       "$crv->Contextual::Return::DUMP()"
           Return a dumpable representation of the return value in all viable
           contexts.

       "local $Data::Dumper::Freezer = 'Contextual::Return::FREEZE';"
       "local $Data::Dumper::Freezer = \&Contextual::Return::FREEZE;"
           Configure Data::Dumper to correctly dump a representation of the
           contextual return value.

DIAGNOSTICS
       "Can't use %s as export specifier"
           In your "use Contextual::Return" statement you specified something
           (such as a hash or coderef) that can't be used to select what the
           module exports. Make sure the list of selectors includes only
           strings, regexes, or references to arrays of strings or regexes.

       "use Contextual::Return qr{%s} didn't export anything"
           In your "use Contextual::Return" statement you specified a regex to
           select which handlers to support, but the regex didn't select any
           handlers. Check that the regex you're using actually does match at
           least one of the names of the modules many handlers.

       "Can't export %s: no such handler"
           In your "use Contextual::Return" statement you specified a string
           as the name of a context handler to be exported, but the module
           doesn't export a handler of that name. Check the spelling for the
           requested export.

       "Can't call %s in a %s context"
       "Can't use return value of %s in a %s context"
           The subroutine you called uses a contextual return, but doesn't
           specify what to return in the particular context in which you
           called it. You either need to change the context in which you're
           calling the subroutine, or else add a context block corresponding
           to the offending context (or perhaps a "DEFAULT {...}" block).

       "Can't call bare %s {...} in %s context"
           You specified a handler (such as "VOID {...}" or "LIST {...}")
           outside any subroutine, and in a context that it can't handle. Did
           you mean to place the handler outside of a subroutine?  If so, then
           you need to put it in a context it can actually handle.  Otherwise,
           perhaps you need to replace the trailing block with parens (that
           is: VOID() or LIST()).

       "Call to %s at %s didn't return a %s reference""
           You called the subroutine in a context that expected to get back a
           reference of some kind but the subroutine didn't specify the
           corresponding "SCALARREF", "ARRAYREF", "HASHREF", "CODEREF",
           "GLOBREF", or generic "REF", "NONVOID", or "DEFAULT" handlers.  You
           need to specify the appropriate one of these handlers in the
           subroutine.

       "Can't call method '%s' on %s value returned by %s""
           You called the subroutine and then tried to call a method on the
           return value, but the subroutine returned a classname or object
           that doesn't have that method. This probably means that the
           subroutine didn't return the classname or object you expected. Or
           perhaps you need to specify an "OBJREF {...}" context block.

       "Can't install two %s handlers"
           You attempted to specify two context blocks of the same name in the
           same return context, which is ambiguous. For example:

               sub foo: lvalue {
                   LVALUE { $foo = $_ }
                   RVALUE { $foo }
                   LVALUE { $foo = substr($_,1,10) }
               }

           or:

               sub bar {
                   return
                       BOOL { 0 }
                       NUM  { 1 }
                       STR  { "two" }
                       BOOL { 1 };
               }

           Did you cut-and-paste wrongly, or mislabel one of the blocks?

       "Expected a %s block after the %s block but found instead: %s"
           If you specify any of "LVALUE", "RVALUE", or "NVALUE", then you can
           only specify "LVALUE", "RVALUE", or "NVALUE" blocks in the same
           return context.  If you need to specify other contexts (like
           "BOOL", or "STR", or "REF", etc.), put them inside an "RVALUE"
           block. See "Lvalue contexts" for an example.

       "Call to %s failed at %s"
           This is the default exception that a "FAIL" throws in a non-scalar
           context. Which means that the subroutine you called has signalled
           failure by throwing an exception, and you didn't catch that
           exception.  You should either put the call in an "eval {...}" block
           or else call the subroutine in boolean context instead.

       "Call to %s failed at %s. Attempted to use failure value at %s"
           This is the default exception that a "FAIL" throws when a failure
           value is captured in a scalar variable and later used in a non-
           boolean context. That means that the subroutine you called must
           have failed, and you didn't check the return value for that
           failure, so when you tried to use that invalid value it killed your
           program. You should either put the original call in an "eval {...}"
           or else test the return value in a boolean context and avoid using
           it if it's false.

       "Usage: FAIL_WITH $flag_opt, \%selector, @args"
           The "FAIL_WITH" subroutine expects an optional flag, followed by a
           reference to a configuration hash, followed by a list or selector
           arguments. You gave it something else. See "Configurable Failure
           Contexts".

       "Selector values must be sub refs"
           You passed a configuration hash to "FAIL_WITH" that specified non-
           subroutines as possible "FAIL" handlers. Since non-subroutines
           can't possibly be handlers, maybe you forgot the "sub" keyword
           somewhere?

       "Invalid option: %s =" %s>
           The "FAIL_WITH" subroutine was passed a flag/selector pair, but the
           selector was not one of those allowed by the configuration hash.

       "FAIL handler for package %s redefined"
           A warning that the "FAIL" handler for a particular package was
           reconfigured more than once. Typically that's because the module
           was loaded in two places with difference configurations specified.
           You can't reasonably expect two different sets of behaviours from
           the one module within the one namespace.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
       Contextual::Return requires no configuration files or environment
       variables.

DEPENDENCIES
       Requires version.pm and Want.pm.

INCOMPATIBILITIES
       "LVALUE", "RVALUE", and "NVALUE" do not work correctly under the Perl
       debugger. This seems to be because the debugger injects code to capture
       the return values from subroutines, which interferes destructively with
       the optional final arguments that allow "LVALUE", "RVALUE", and
       "NVALUE" to cascade within a single return.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       No bugs have been reported.
