DESCRIPTION
       The BSD extension provides Tcl programs with new Tcl commands to
       interface to various system calls and library routines present in BSD
       UNIX.

       ::bsd::getloadavg returns the number of processes in the system run
       queue as a list, representing averages over the last 1, 5, and 15
       minutes.

       ::bsd::rlimit lets you get and set the current soft and hard settings
       for resource limits.  You can specify a 64-bit integer value for any of
       the limits or unlimited to indicate that there is or should be no
       limit.

       ::bsd::rlimit limits can be set (or gotten) for the maximum amount of
       virtual memory the process is allowed to map, in bytes, using the
       virtual parameter.  Likewise the largest size core file that can be
       created, in bytes, can be set (or read) using the core parameter.

       The maximum amount of CPU time that can be used by the process can be
       set with the cpu parameter, and the maximum size of the data segment of
       the process can be set with the data argument.  The largest size file
       that can be created, in bytes, can be set with the fsize parameter,
       while the maximum size in bytes that a process can lock into memory
       using the mlock system call can be set with the memlock argument.

       The maximum number of files that can be opened by the process can be
       set with the nofile argument, while the maximum number of simultaneous
       processes for this user ID can be set with the nproc argument.  The
       maximum size that a process's resident set size may grow (a limit on
       the amount of physical memory to be given to the process) can be set,
       in bytes, using the rss argument, while the maximum size of socket
       buffer usage can be controlled using the sockbuf argument.

       The maximum stack size, in bytes, can be set with the stack argument,
       while the maximum amount of spawp space that can be reserved or used by
       all of this user's processes can be examined or controlled using the
       Iswap parameter, while the maximum number of pseudo-terminals created
       by the user can be set or examined using the ptys argument.

       Resource limits can be specified as soft or hard.  If a soft limit is
       exceeded the process may receive a signal but will be allowed to
       continue until it reaches the hard limit.

       ::bsd::rlimit set hard data [expr {256 * 1024 * 1024}], for example,
       sets a hard limit on the data segment size of the process to 256 megs
       of memory.

       See the Berkeley manpage for getrlimit and setrlimit for further
       details on the options available and what they do.

       ::bsd::rusage returns the cumulative resource usage for the current
       process, as a list of key-value pairs, suitable for loading into an
       array using array set.  Resources listed include user CPU, system CPU,
       max resident set size, shared text Kbyte seconds, unshared data Kbyte
       seconds, statck Kbyte seconds, page reclaims, page faults, number of
       times swapped, number of file system inputs and outputs, number of
       interprocess communications (IPC) messages sent and received, number of
       signals delivered, number of voluntary context switches, and number of
       involuntary context switches.  For more information see the BSD
       getursage manpage.

       ::bsd::setproctitle sets the process title that appears on the ps
       command.  The title is set from the executable's name, followed by the
       specified string.  If the string argument begins with a dash
       characters, the executable's name is skipped.  If no string is
       specified, the process title is restored.  For more information see the
       BSD setproctitle manpage.

       ::bsd::statfs returns information about a mounted filesystem.  The path
       argument is the path name of any file within the mounted filesystem.
       Results are returned as a list of key-value pairs suitable for loading
       into an array using array set.  Values returned include the fundamental
       filesystem block size (fundamentalFileSystemBlockSize), the optimal
       transfer block size (optimalTransferBlockSize), the total number of
       data blocks (totalDataBlocks), the total number of free blocks
       (freeBlocks), and the total number of available free blocks
       (availableFreeBlocks).  Also included are the total number of
       filesystem nodes (totalFileNodes) and the free file nodes
       (freeFileNodes), the file system type (fileSystemType), mount point
       (mountPoint), and mounted filesystem name (mountedFileSystem).  Finally
       a list of flags is provided, which can include readOnly, synchronous,
       noExec, noSUID, noDev, union, asynchronous, SUIDdir, softUpdates,
       noFollowSymlinks, noAtime, noClusterRead, noClusterWrite,
       exportReadOnly, exported, worldExported, anonUidMapping,
       kerberosUidMapping, webNFS, filesystemStoredLocally, quotasEnabled,
       rootFilesystem, userMounted, multiLabel, gjournal and aclsEnabled.

       ::bsd::getfsstat functions like statfs, except that it returns a list
       of lists with information about all mounted filesystems.  If -nowait or
       no option is specified, getfsstat will directly return the filesystem
       information retained in the kernel to avoid delays caused by waiting
       for updated information from a filesystem that is perhaps temporarily
       unable to respond, at the cost of the data perhaps not reflecting the
       absolutely current status of the filesystem.  As some of the
       information returned may be out of date, if -wait is specified,
       getfsstat will request updated information for each mounted filesystem
       prior to returning.

       ::bsd::syslog provides a direct interface to the syslog library to
       provide a way to write messages into the system log.  ::bsd::syslog
       open takes an identifier, a list of zero or more log options, and a
       facility name.  The facility name can be one of auth, authpriv,
       console, cron, daemon, ftp, kern, lpr, mail, news, ntp, security,
       syslog, user, uucp, local0, local1, local2, local3, local4, local5,
       local6, or local7.

       Log options can include console, which causes the message to be logged
       on the console if there are errors in sending it, no_delay, which
       theoretically says not to delay opening the syslog connection until the
       first syslog call is made, but check your documentation on syslog(3) to
       see if that's really true, pid, which says to log the process ID along
       with whatever else, and perror, which says to log the message to stderr
       as well as to the system log.

       ::bsd::syslog log takes a priority and a message.  Priority can be one
       of emerg, alert, crit, err, warning, notice, info, or debug, in
       descending order of priority.  Check your documentation on your syslog
       library, high priority messages do stuff besides logging, like blasting
       to all logged in users, while ::bsd::syslog close closes the connection
       to the system log.  Finally, ::bsd::syslog logmask sets the log
       priority mask and masks all priorities up to and including the
       specified one.  For instance, if you invoked the logmask option with
       the info priority, both info and debug log messages would be
       suppressed.

       ::bsd::abort causes abnormal program termination to occur by issuing an
       abort signal and will work unless the SIGABRT signal is being caught
       and the signal handler does not return.

       ::bsd::cptime takes an array name as an argument and will fill it with
       key-value pairs representing system, user, nice, interrupt, idle, and
       total clock  counts.

       Upon a second invocation with the same array as an argument, it will
       calculate the cpu time of the various elements as a percentage over the
       range of elapsed time since the prior call, returning the percentages
       as a list of key-value pairs and updating the array with the latest
       sampled values.

       ::bsd::cptime time; after 1000; puts [::bsd::cptime time]

       user 12 nice 0 sys 0 intr 0 idle 87

       This is a more instantaneous way to judge CPU utilization than load
       average, which is a weighted average that changes slowly over time, so
       the load average can be 100 but the CPUs may be 95% because really the
       load average isn't 100, it's just slowly falling back from when it was
       at or even far above that.

       ::bsd::getkey reads a single key from the user's terminal and returns
       it as an integer value.  For example, invoking the function and then
       pressing a on the terminal returns 97.

       The timeout value, if specified, is the number of seconds to wait for a
       key to be pressed.  It has accuracy to about a tenth of a second and
       must be a value between 0.0 and 25.5.  If no key is pressed within the
       timeout interval, an empty string is returned.  If the timeout is not
       specified, getkey will wait for an unlimited amount of time for a key
       to be pressed.

       ::bsd::uptime returns the number of CPU seconds that the system has
       been up, as a double-precision floating point number.

       ::bsd::set_panic_proc sets the Tcl panic proc, a C function that is
       invoked in the event that the Tcl interpreter encounters a crash
       condition and invokes Tcl_Panic, to one provided by tclbsd.  The tclbsd
       version logs the panic message to the system log via the syslog()
       system call as well are writing it to stderr.  (The default version
       only writes it to stderr).

       ::bsd::panic message invokes Tcl's Tcl_Panic function with the
       specified message as its argument.
