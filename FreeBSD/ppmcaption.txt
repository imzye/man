NAME
       ppmcaption - add text captions to PPM, PGM, or PBM images

SYNOPSIS
       ppmcaption [-font bdf-file] [-scale float] [-blur int] [-opacity float]
       [-fg color] [-bg color] [-pos x y] [-left] [-right] [-center] [-text
       string]

DESCRIPTION
       The ppmcaption program adds text to a PPM, PGM, or PBM image.  Multiple
       blocks of text can be placed on the image, with varying fonts, font
       sizes, colors, and transparency.

OPTIONS
       ppmcaption accepts the following options:

       -font filename
               Specifies a BDF font file to load.  If a default font was built
               in to the program at compile-time, the default is to use that.
               Otherwise this must be the name of a file in Adobe Binary
               Distribution Format that specifies a bitmap font, and it must
               be specified before the first -text argument.

               If there is a builtin font, you can reload it with -font
               builtin.

       -scale float
               Scale the currently-selected font up or down by the given
               ratio, e.g., 0.5 divides the font size in half.  When scaling
               down, the font will be nicely anti-aliased onto the background
               image.  However, when scaling up (> 1.0), the font will get
               pixellated.

               Note that -scale operations are cumulative: for cleanest
               results, it's best to reload the font (with -font) before re-
               scaling.

       -blur integer
               Add an N pixel halo around the currently selected font, so that
               it is visible on both light and dark backgrounds.  The font
               will be in the current foreground color, and the halo in the
               background color.

               It tends to look better to scale then blur, rather than the
               other way around.

               Like -scale, -blur operations are cumulative.

               Note that large blur values are pretty slow.

       -opacity float
               How transparent to draw the next block of text.  0.0 means
               invisible, 1.0 means solid.

       -fg color
               Foreground color of next block of text.  Default is black.

       -bg color
               Background color (color of blur halo).  Default is white.

               A small number of color names are supported ("black", "white",
               etc.) or hexadecimal triplets of the form "#RRGGBB" may be
               used.

       -pos X Y
               Where to position the next block of text.  Positive numbers are
               measured from the upper left of the image; Negative numbers are
               measured from the bottom right of the image.  So "-10" means
               near the right (or bottom) edge, regardless of the image size.

       -left   The next block of text will be flush-left, that is, have its
               left edge at the current position (this is the default.)

       -right  The next block of text will be flush-right, that is, have its
               right edge at the current position.

       -center The next block of text will be centered on top of the current
               position.  Note that this only applies to the X position, not
               Y: multi-line text is also centered on X, but grows down.

       -text string
               Place the given text in the image at the current position and
               in the current font.  Newlines are allowed; tabs are not
               handled.

               If the text contains percent (%) characters, they are
               interpreted as for strftime(3), so you can easily put
               timestamps into images.

       -time time_t
               This sets the time which will be formatted by percent
               directives in the -text arguments.  It defaults to the current
               time, but you can make it be the write-date of the input file
               by saying -time file, or can set it to a specific time by
               specifying a number of seconds after the Epoch (Jan 1, 1970.)
