xbrightness(1)          FreeBSD General Commands Manual         xbrightness(1)

NAME
       xbrightness - Adjust a monitor's brightness for XFree86

SYNOPSIS
       xbrightness BRIGHTNESS [ GAMMA ]

DESCRIPTION
       xbrightness sets the overall brightness of a monitor via the XFree86 X
       server video mode extension (XFree86-VidModeExtension).

       It uses the new XF86VidModeSetGammaRamp function, which provides a more
       flexible control than the old XF86VidModeSetGamma.  The latter function
       cannot change the endpoints of the gamma curve, only the middle, so
       full brightness remains full brightness no matter how you set the
       gamma.


ARGUMENTS
       BRIGHTNESS
               A number from 0 to 65535, where 0 means complete darkness, and
               65535 means normal functioning - full brightness.

       GAMMA   A float number from 0.0 to 10.0, which gives the exponent used
               for building the gamma ramp. The default is 1.0 (linear).


ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY To get default host and display number.

BUGS
       Does not have
               display or screen arguments - set these via DISPLAY environment
               variable if necessary.

       Does not query brightness, only sets it.

       Does not play well with xgamma - xbrightness will erase xgamma's
               settings and vice versa.

HISTORY
       Written in January 2003 to use the recently added
       XF86VidModeSetGammaRamp function as an overall brightness control.

       Additions in September 2005 in order to get some revival from a shifted
       LCD screen.
