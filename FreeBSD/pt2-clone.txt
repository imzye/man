NAME
       pt2-clone - Amiga ProTracker v2.3D clone for modern computers

SYNOPSIS
       pt2-clone file

DESCRIPTION
       pt2-clone is a multi-platform clone of the classic music making
       software "ProTracker" (version 2.3D) from the Commodore Amiga days.
       Aims to work exactly like you remember it, with added features and
       fixes. Music created in ProTracker uses the MOD file format.

       The original Protracker was written 1990. The original has a setup
       screen (this version can be setup using ~/.protracker/protracker.ini).
       MIDI support and split keys (usually for MIDI situations) are not
       implemented.

       This version has a WAV sample loader/saver with support for
       loops/name/volume chunk attributes from sampler exported WAVs. STK (The
       Ultimate Soundtracker) loader (effects/sample loop types). Loading of
       PowerPacker'd MODs. 128 kB sample support. MOD2WAV for exporting the
       song to .WAV.
