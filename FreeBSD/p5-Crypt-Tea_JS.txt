NAME
       tea - Perl script to give command-line access to Crypt::Tea_JS.pm

SYNOPSIS
         tea -c filename   # enCrypts filename
         tea filename      # decrypts filename
         tea -s filename   # calculates ascii digital Signature for filename
         tea -j            # outputs Javascript code to do compatible encryption
         tea -o            # set Old mode, for Crypt::Tea-compatibility
         tea -h            # prints this Helpful message
         ps axww | tea -s  # have the best password in town !

       For encryption and decryption, you will be asked for a password.  It
       should be a sufficiently longish string; say 17 random 8-bit bytes.

DESCRIPTION
       This script uses the Crypt::Tea_JS.pm module to offer new TEA, the Tiny
       Encryption Algorithm, and some Modes of Use based on CBC, compatibly in
       both Perl and JavaScript.

       The various options offer encryption, decryption and digest, and all
       cyphertext is ascii-encoded to prevent munging. Another option returns
       JavaScript code which offers identical functions in JS, and this can be
       used by CGIs to feed to the browser.
