NAME
       trainlid - build transition matrix for Lingua::Ident module

SYNOPSIS
       trainlid [-s] language_name < training_text > matrix_file

DESCRIPTION
       trainlid builds a trigram transition matrix for use with the
       Lingua::Ident module.  It reads a training text from standard input and
       outputs a transition matrix with the specified language_name as
       identifier to standard output.

       It is recommended that language_name be a POSIX locale name constructed
       from an ISO 639 2-letter language code, possibly extended by an ISO
       3166 2-letter country code and a character set identifier. Example:
       de_DE.iso88591.

       The following options are available:

       -s   Do not print statistics after building the language model.
