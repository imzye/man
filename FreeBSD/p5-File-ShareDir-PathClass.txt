NAME
       File::ShareDir::PathClass - File::ShareDir returning Path::Class
       objects

VERSION
       version 1.112440

SYNOPSIS
           use File::ShareDir::PathClass '-all';
           my $dir = dist_dir("File-ShareDir-PathClass")
           # $dir is a Path::Class object now

           # - or -

           use File::ShareDir::PathClass;
           my $dir = File::ShareDir::PathClass->dist_dir("File-ShareDir-PathClass");
           # $dir is a Path::Class object now

DESCRIPTION
       This module is just a wrapper around File::ShareDir functions,
       transforming their return value to Path::Class objects. This allows for
       easier usage of the value.

       Refer to File::ShareDir (section FUNCTIONS) for a list of which
       functions are supported.

       "File::ShareDir::PathClass" supports both a procedural and a clas
       methods API.

   Procedural mode
       All functions are exportable. Nothing is exported by default, though.
       One has to list which function(s) she wants to import.

       Some groups are defined for your convenience:

       •   "all" - all available functions.

       Note that this module is exporting subs via Sub::Exporter, so groups
       are available either as ":group" or "-group". One can also play any
       trick supported by Sub::Exporter, check its documentation for further
       information.

   Class method mode
       Otherwise, functions are available as class methods, called as:

           File::ShareDir::PathClass->method();

       In this case, one doesn't need to import anything during module use-
       age.
