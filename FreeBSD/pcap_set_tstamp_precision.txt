PCAP_SET_TSTAMP_PRECISION(3)                  FreeBSD Library Functions Manual





NAME
       pcap_set_tstamp_precision - set the time stamp precision returned in
       captures

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       int pcap_set_tstamp_precision(pcap_t *p, int tstamp_precision);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_set_tstamp_precision() sets the precision of the time stamp
       desired for packets captured on the pcap descriptor to the type
       specified by tstamp_precision.  It must be called on a pcap descriptor
       created by pcap_create(3) that has not yet been activated by
       pcap_activate(3).  Two time stamp precisions are supported,
       microseconds and nanoseconds. One can use options
       PCAP_TSTAMP_PRECISION_MICRO and PCAP_TSTAMP_PRECISION_NANO to request
       desired precision. By default, time stamps are in microseconds.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_set_tstamp_precision() returns 0 on success if the specified time
       stamp precision is expected to be supported by the capture device,
       PCAP_ERROR_TSTAMP_PRECISION_NOTSUP if the capture device does not
       support the requested time stamp precision, PCAP_ERROR_ACTIVATED if
       called on a capture handle that has been activated.

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
       This function became available in libpcap release 1.5.1.  In previous
       releases, time stamps from a capture device or savefile are always
       given in seconds and microseconds.
