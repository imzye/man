   FROM PSTOEDITQTGUI
       PstoeditQtGui provides an alternative to the command driven operation.
       The GUI provides access to almost all options and features that are
       supported by pstoedit.  In addition it supports the conversion of
       multiple files in one job and also provides some shortcuts to some of
       Ghostscript's high level output devices.

       The GUI is implemented using QT (https://www.qt.io).

       The various options provided by pstoedit are displayed in different
       tabs in the GUI according to their category.  A link to a more detailed
       description of each option into this manual is provided with each
       option in the GUI.

       Side note: None of the options are "hard coded" into the GUI. Instead
       the meta information is retrieved from pstoedit itself.  By this the
       GUI is always up to date with respect to the options and formats
       provided by pstoedit.

DESCRIPTION
   RELEASE LEVEL
       This man-page documents release 4.02 of pstoedit.

   USE
       pstoedit converts PostScript and PDF files into various vector graphics
       formats. The resulting files can be edited or imported into various
       drawing packages. Type

       pstoedit -help

       for a list of supported output formats. Pstoedit comes with a large set
       of format drivers built into in the binary. Additional drivers can be
       installed as plugins and are available from
       http://www.pstoedit.net/plugins/.  Simply copy the plugins into the
       same directory where the pstoedit binary is installed or - on Unix like
       systems only - alternatively into the lib directory in parallel to the
       bin directory where pstoedit is installed.

       However, unless you also get a license key for the plugins, the
       additional drivers will slightly distort the resulting graphics. See
       the documentation that comes with the plugins for more details.

   PRINCIPLE OF CONVERSION
       pstoedit works by redefining some of PostScript's basic drawing
       operators, such as stroke or show (bitmaps drawn by the image operator
       are not supported by all output formats.) After redefining these
       operators, the PostScript or PDF file that needs to be converted is
       processed by a PostScript interpreter, e.g., Ghostscript (gs(1)).  You
       normally need to have a PostScript interpreter installed in order to
       use this program. However, you can perform some "back end only"
       processing of files following the conventions of the pstoedit
       intermediate format by specifying the -bo option. See "Available
       formats and their specific options" below.

       The output that is written by the interpreter due to the redefinition
       of the drawing operators is a kind of 'flat' PostScript file containing
       only simple operations such as moveto, lineto, show, etc. You can view
       this file using the -f debug option.

       This output is read by the end-processing functions of pstoedit and
       triggers the drawing functions in the selected output format driver
       sometimes called also "back-end".

   NOTES ON GHOSTSCRIPT
       Although pstoedit was designed to allow the use of any kind of
       PostScript interpreter, it has only been tested in combination with
       Ghostscript (https://ghostscript.com).

       Up to version 9.55 of Ghostscript, it's PDF interpreter was implemented
       in PostScript itself.  That allowed pstoedit to handle PDF files in the
       same way as PostScript files since the same mechanisms for intercepting
       the drawing operations could be used.

       However, from version 9.56 on, the PDF interpreter of Ghostscript was
       implemented in C and hence the interceptions used by pstoedit are no
       longer effective when processing PDF files.

       You need to convert the PDF to PostScript at first before you can
       convert it into another format.  You can use Ghostscript for that or
       also use the gs:ps2write (-f gs:ps2write) driver from pstoedit.

OPTIONS
   GENERAL OPTIONS
       The following options are available:

       [-include filename]

              This option allows specifying an additional PostScript file that
              will be executed just before the normal input is read. This is
              helpful for including specific page settings or for disabling
              potentially unsafe PostScript operators, e.g., file, renamefile,
              or deletefile.

       [-xscale number]

              scale by a factor in x-direction

       [-yscale number]

              scale by a factor in y-direction

       [-xshift number]

              shift image in x-direction

       [-yshift number]

              shift image in y-direction

       [-centered]

              center image before scaling or shifting

       [-minlinewidth number]

              minimal line width. All lines thinner than this will be drawn in
              this line width - especially zero-width lines

       [-pagenumberformat page number format specification]

              format specification for page numbers in filename if -split is
              used. The specification is used to create the page number using
              sprintf. The specification shall not include the leading % nor
              the trailing d. Default is empty string which results in
              formatting the page number using %d. This results in page
              numbers like 1, 2, ..., 10. Sometimes you may want to have fixed
              length with leading 0, so you might want to specify 02 which
              means 2 digits with leading 0.

       [-split]

              Create a new file for each page of the input. For this the
              output filename must contain a %d which is replaced with the
              current page number. This option is automatically switched on
              for output formats that do not support multiple pages within one
              file, e.g. fig or gnuplot.

       [-usebbfrominput]

              If specified, pstoedit uses the BoundingBox as is (hopefully)
              found in the input file instead of one that is calculated by its
              own.

       [-page page number]

              Select a single page from a multi-page PostScript or PDF file.

       [-rgb]

              Since version 3.30 pstoedit uses the CMYK colors internally. The
              -rgb option turns on the old behavior to use RGB values.

       [-useagl]

              use Adobe Glyph List instead of the ISO Latin-1 table (this is
              experimental)

       [-noclip]

              do not use clipping (relevant only if output format supports
              clipping at all)

       [-rotate angle (0-360)]

              Rotate image by angle.

       [-pagesize page format]

              set page size for output medium.  This option sets the page size
              for the output medium. Currently this is just used by the
              libplot output format driver, but might be used by other output
              format drivers in future. The page size is specified in terms of
              the usual page size names, e.g. letter or a4.

       [-help]

              show the help information

       [-bo]

              You can run backend processing only (without the PostScript
              interpreter frontend) by first running pstoedit -f dump infile
              dumpfile and then running pstoedit -f format -bo dumpfile
              outfile.

       [-psarg argument string]

              The string given with this option is passed directly to
              Ghostscript when Ghostscript is called to process the PostScript
              file for pstoedit.  For example: -psarg "-r300x300".  This
              causes the resolution to be changed to 300x300 dpi. (With older
              versions of Ghostscript, changing the resolution this way has an
              effect only if the -dis option is given.) If you want to pass
              multiple options to Ghostscript you can use multiple -psarg
              options -psarg opt1 -psarg opt2 -psarg opt2.  See the
              Ghostscript manual for other possible options.

       [-pslanguagelevel PostScript Language Level 1, 2, or 3 to be used.]

              PostScript Language Level 1, 2, or 3 to be used. You can switch
              Ghostscript into PostScript Level 1 only mode by
              -pslanguagelevel 1.  This can be useful for example if the
              PostScript file to be converted uses some Level 2 specific
              custom color models that are not supported by pstoedit. However,
              this requires that the PostScript program checks for the
              PostScript level supported by the interpreter and "acts"
              accordingly. The default language level is 3.

       -f "format[:options]"

              target output format recognized by pstoedit.  Since other format
              drivers can be loaded dynamically, type pstoedit -help to get a
              full list of formats. See "Available formats and their specific
              options" below for an explanation of the [:options] to -f
              format. If the format option is not given, pstoedit tries to
              guess the target format from the suffix of the output filename.
              However, in a lot of cases, this is not a unique mapping and
              hence pstoedit demands the -f option.

       [-gs either full path to the Ghostscript executable/DLL or - for
       Windows - just a version number (e.g. 10.01.0), in which case the
       version is used to look up the path from the registry.]

              tells pstoedit which Ghostscript executable/DLL to use -
              overwrites the internal search heuristic

       [-gsregbase Ghostscript base registry path]

              registry path to use as a base path when searching Ghostscript
              interpreter.  This option provides means to specify a registry
              key under HKLM/Software where to search for GS interpreter key,
              version and GS_DLL / GS_LIB values. Example: "-gsregbase
              MyCompany" means that HKLM/Software/MyCompany/GPL Ghostscript
              would be searched instead of HKLM/Software/GPL Ghostscript.

   TEXT AND FONT HANDLING RELATED OPTIONS
       The following options are available:

       [-df font name]

              Sometimes fonts embedded in a PostScript program do not have a
              fontname. For example, this happens in PostScript files
              generated by dvips(1).  In such a case pstoedit uses a
              replacement font. The default for this is Courier. Another font
              can be specified using the -df option. -df Helvetica causes all
              unnamed fonts to be replaced by Helvetica.

       [-nomaptoisolatin1]

              Normally pstoedit maps all character codes to the ones defined
              by the ISO Latin1 encoding. If you specify -nomaptoisolatin1
              then the encoding from the input PostScript is passed unchanged
              to the output. This may result in strange text output but on the
              other hand may be the only way to get some fonts converted
              appropriately. Try what fits best to your concrete case.

       [-pngimage filename]

              for debugging purpose mainly. Write result of processing also to
              a PNG file

       [-dt]

              draw text. Text is drawn as polygons. This might produce a large
              output file. This option is automatically switched on if the
              selected output format does not support text, e.g. gnuplot(1).

       [-adt]

              automatic draw text. This option turns on the -dt option
              selectively for fonts that seem to be no normal text fonts, e.g.
              Symbol.

       [-ndt]

              never draw text. Fully disable the heuristics used by pstoedit
              to decide when to "draw" text instead of showing it as text.
              This may produce incorrect results, but in some cases it might
              nevertheless be useful. "Use at own risk".

       [-dgbm]

              experimental - draw also bitmaps generated by fonts/glyphs

       [-correctdefinefont]

              Some PostScript files, e.g. such as generated by ChemDraw, use
              the PostScript definefont operator in a way that is incompatible
              with pstoedit's assumptions. The new font is defined by copying
              an old font without changing the FontName of the new font. When
              this option is applied, some "patches" are done after a
              definefont in order to make it again compatible with pstoedit's
              assumptions. This option is not enabled by default, since it may
              break other PostScript files. It is tested only with ChemDraw
              generated files.

       [-pti]

              precision text. Normally a text string is drawn as it occurs in
              the input file. However, in some situations, this might produce
              wrongly positioned characters. This is due to limitations in
              most output formats of pstoedit. They cannot represent text with
              arbitrary inter-letter spacing which is easily possible in PDF
              and PostScript. With -pta, each character of a text string is
              placed separately. With -pti, this is done only in cases when
              there is a non zero inter-letter spacing. The downside of
              "precision text" is a bigger file size and hard to edit text.

       [-pta]

              see -pti

       [-uchar character]

              Sometimes pstoedit cannot map a character from the encoding used
              by the PostScript file to the font encoding of the target
              format. In this case pstoedit replaces the input character by a
              special character in order to show all the places that could not
              be mapped correctly. The default for this is a "#". Using the
              -uchar option it is possible to specify another character to be
              used instead. If you want to use a space, use -uchar " ".

       [-t2fontsast1]

              Handle Type 2 fonts same as Type 1. Type 2 fonts sometimes occur
              as embedded fonts within PDF files. In the default mode, text
              using such fonts is drawn as polygons since pstoedit assumes
              that such a font is not available on the user's machine. If this
              option is set, pstoedit assumes that the internal encoding
              follows the same as for a standard font and generates normal
              text output. This assumption may not be true in all cases. But
              it is nearly impossible for pstoedit to verify this assumption -
              it would have to do a sort of OCR.

       [-nfr]

              In normal mode pstoedit replaces bitmap fonts with a font as
              defined by the -df option. This is done, because most output
              formats cannot handle such fonts. This behavior can be switched
              off using the -nfr option but then it strongly depends on the
              application reading the generated file whether the file is
              usable and correctly interpreted or not. Any problems are then
              out of control of pstoedit.

       [-glyphs]

              pass glyph names to the output format driver. So far no output
              format driver really uses the glyph names, so this does not have
              any effect at the moment. It is a preparation for future work.

       [-useoldnormalization]

              Just use this option in case the new heuristic introduced in 3.5
              does not produce correct results - however, this normalization
              of font encoding will always be a best-effort approach since
              there is no real general solution to it with reasonable effort

       [-fontmap name of font map file for pstoedit]

              The font map is a simple text file containing lines in the
              following format:

       document_font_name target_font_name
       Lines beginning with % are considered comments.
       For font names with spaces use the "font name with spaces" notation.

       If a target_font_name starts with /, it is regarded as alias to a
       former entry.

       Each font name found in the document is checked against this mapping
       and if there is a corresponding entry, the new name is used for the
       output.

       If the -fontmap option is not specified, pstoedit automatically looks
       for the file drivername.fmp in the installation directory and uses that
       file as a default fontmap file if available. The installation directory
       is:


              *      MS Windows: The same directory where the pstoedit
                     executable is located

              *      Unix:
                     The default installation directory. If it fails, then
                     <The directory where the pstoedit executable is located>
                     /../lib/

              The mpost.fmp in the misc directory of the pstoedit distribution
              is a sample map file with mappings from over 5000 PostScript
              font names to their TeX equivalents. This is useful because
              MetaPost is frequently used with TeX/LaTeX and those programs do
              not use standard font names. This file and the MetaPost output
              format driver are provided by Scott Pakin
              (scott+ps2ed_AT_pakin.org).  Another example is wemf.fmp to be
              used under Windows. See the misc directory of the pstoedit
              source distribution.  After loading the implicit (based on
              driver name) or explicit (based on the -fontmap option) font map
              file, a system specific map file is searched and loaded from the
              installation directory (unix.fmp or windows.fmp). This file can
              be used to redirect certain fonts to system specific names using
              the /AliasName notation described above.

   DRAWING RELATED OPTIONS
       The following options are available:

       [-nc]

              no curves.  Normally pstoedit tries to keep curves from the
              input and transfers them to the output if the output format
              supports curves. If the output format does not support curves,
              then pstoedit replaces curves by a series of lines (see also
              -flat option). However, in some cases the user might wish to
              have this behavior also for output formats that originally
              support curves. This can be forced via the -nc option.

       [-mergelines]

              Some output formats permit the representation of filled polygons
              with edges that are in a different color than the fill color.
              Since PostScript does not support this by the standard drawing
              primitives directly, drawing programs typically generate two
              objects (the outline and the filled polygon) into the PostScript
              output. pstoedit is able to recombine these, if they follow each
              other directly and you specify -mergelines.  However, this
              merging is not supported by all output formats due to
              restrictions in the target format.

       [-filledrecttostroke]

              Rectangles filled with a solid color can be converted to a
              stroked line with a width that corresponds to the width of the
              rectangle. This is of primary interest for output formats which
              do not support filled polygons at all. But it is restricted to
              rectangles only, i.e. it is not supported for general polygons

       [-mergetext]

              In order to produce nice looking text output, programs producing
              PostScript files often split words into smaller pieces which are
              then placed individually on adjacent positions. However, such
              split text is hard to edit later on and hence it is sometime
              better to recombine these pieces again to form a word (or even
              sequence of words). For this pstoedit implements some heuristics
              about what text pieces are to be considered parts of a split
              word. This is based on the geometrical proximity of the
              different parts and seems to work quite well so far. But there
              are certainly cases where this simple heuristic fails. So please
              check the results carefully.

       [-ssp]

              simulate subpaths.  Several output formats do not support
              PostScript paths containing subpaths, i.e. paths with
              intermediate movetos. In the normal case, each subpath is
              treated as an independent path for such output formats. This can
              lead to bad looking results. The most common case where this
              happens is if you use the -dt option and show some text with
              letters like e, o, or b, i.e. letters that have a "hole". When
              the -ssp option is set, pstoedit tries to eliminate these
              problems. However, this option is CPU time intensive!

       [-sfill]

              simulate filling by individual strokes.

       [-flat flatness factor]

              If the output format does not support curves in the way
              PostScript does or if the -nc option is specified, all curves
              are approximated by lines. Using the -flat option one can
              control this approximation. This parameter is directly converted
              to a PostScript setflat command. Higher numbers, e.g. 10 give
              rougher, lower numbers, e.g. 0.1, give finer approximations.

       [-sclip]

              simulate clipping.  Most output formats of pstoedit do not have
              native support for clipping. For that pstoedit offers an option
              to perform the clipping of the graphics directly without passing
              the clippath to the output driver. However, this results in
              curves being replaced by a lot of line segments and thus larger
              output files. So use this option only if your output looks
              different from the input due to clipping. In addition, this
              "simulated clipping" is not exactly the same as defined in
              PostScript. There might be lines drawn at double size. Also
              clipping of text is not supported unless you also use the -dt
              option.

   DIAGNOSTIC AND DEBUG OPTIONS
       The following options are available:

       [-dis]

              Open a display during processing by Ghostscript. Some files only
              work correctly this way.

       [-q]

              quiet mode - do not write startup message

       [-nq]

              no exit from the PostScript interpreter. Normally Ghostscript
              exits after processing the pstoedit input-file. For debugging it
              can be useful to avoid this. If you do, you will have to type
              quit at the GS> prompt to exit from Ghostscript.

       [-v]

              Switch on verbose mode. Some additional information is shown
              during processing.

       [-vl ]

              Switch on verbose mode with a given level. Some additional
              information is shown during processing.

       [-nb]

              Since version 3.10 pstoedit uses the -dDELAYBIND option when
              calling Ghostscript. Previously the -dNOBIND option was used
              instead but that sometimes caused problems if a user's
              PostScript file overloaded standard PostScript operator with
              totally new semantic, e.g. lt for lineto instead of the standard
              meaning of "less than". Using -nb the old style can be activated
              again in case the -dDELAYBIND gives different results as before.
              In such a case please also contact the author.

       [-rdb]

              Since version 3.10 pstoedit uses the -dDELAYBIND option when
              calling Ghostscript. But in version 9.22 of Ghostscript, that
              option is not supported anymore because of security reasons. As
              a fallback, that version provides the REALLYDELAYBIND option and
              pstoedit can use this if you supply the -rdb option. Use this
              with caution as it might open security risks, e.g. a PostScript
              file injecting some malicious code into PostScript standard
              operators. However, not using this option can cause some of the
              PostScript drawings operations to be not seen by pstoedit, hence
              causing missing artefacts in the output. Later versions of
              Ghostscript will probably support -dDELAYBIND again. But also in
              that case the security risk remains. So be careful with what
              files you process with pstoedit and Ghostscript.

       [-ups]

              write text as plain string instead of hex string in intermediate
              format - normally useful for trouble shooting and debugging
              only.

       [-usefinddevice]

              use the ghostscript internal finddevice operator during image
              handling instead of standard operators - normally useful for
              trouble shooting and debugging only.

       [-keep]

              keep the intermediate files produced by pstoedit - for debug
              purposes only

       [-debugfonthandling]

              writes verbose messages related to internal font processing -
              for debug purposes only

       [-gstest]

              perform a basic test of the interworking with Ghostscript

       [-fakedateandversion]

              Just for regression testing - uses a constant date and version
              string.

   INPUT AND OUTFILE FILE ARGUMENTS
       [ inputfile [outputfile] ]

       If neither an input nor an output file is given as argument, pstoedit
       works as filter reading from standard input and writing to standard
       output.  The special filename "-" can also be used. It represents
       standard input if it is the first on the command line and standard
       output if it is the second. So "pstoedit - output.xxx" reads from
       standard input and writes to output.xxx

AVAILABLE FORMATS AND THEIR SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       pstoedit allows passing individual options to an output format driver.
       This is done by appending all options to the format specified after the
       -f option. The format specifier and its options must be separated by a
       colon (:). If more than one option needs to be passed to the output
       format driver, the whole argument to -f must be enclosed within
       double-quote characters, thus:

       -f "format[:option option ...]"

       To see which options are supported by a specific format, type: pstoedit
       -f format:-help

       The following description of the different formats supported by
       pstoedit is extracted from the source code of the individual drivers.

       [-sampleoption integer]

              just an example

   EMF - ENHANCED MS WINDOWS METAFILE
       The following driver specific options are available:

       [-m]

              map to Arial

       [-nf]

              emulate narrow fonts

       [-drawbb]

              draw bounding box

       [-p]

              prune line ends

       [-nfw]

              Newer versions of MS Windows (2000, XP, Vista, 7, ...) will not
              accept WMF/EMF files generated when this option is set and the
              input contains text. But if this option is not set, then the
              WMF/EMF driver will estimate interletter spacing of text using a
              very coarse heuristic. This may result in ugly looking output.
              On the other hand, OpenOffice can still read EMF/WMF files where
              pstoedit delegates the calculation of the inter letter spacing
              to the program reading the WMF/EMF file. So if the generated
              WMF/EMF file shall never be processed under MS Windows, use this
              option. If WMF/EMF files with high precision text need to be
              generated under *nix the only option is to use the -pta option
              of pstoedit. However that causes every text to be split into
              single characters which makes the text hard to edit afterwards.
              Hence the -nfw option provides a sort of compromise between
              portability and nice to edit but still nice looking text. Again
              - this option has no meaning when pstoedit is executed under MS
              Windows anyway. In that case the output is portable but
              nevertheless not split and still looks fine.

       [-winbb]

              let the MS Windows API calculate the Bounding Box (MS Windows
              only)

       [-OO]

              generate OpenOffice compatible EMF file

NOTES ON SPECIFIC FORMATS AND DRIVERS
   AUTOTRACE
       pstoedit cooperates with autotrace. Autotrace can now produce a dump
       file for further processing by pstoedit using the -bo (back-end only)
       option.  Autotrace is a program written by a group around Martin Weber
       and can be found at https://sourceforge.net/projects/autotrace/.

   PS2AI
       The ps2ai output format driver is not a native pstoedit output format
       driver. It does not use the pstoedit PostScript flattener, instead it
       uses the PostScript program ps2ai.ps which is installed in the
       Ghostscript distribution directory. It is included to provide the same
       "look-and-feel" for the conversion to AI.  However, lot's of files do
       not convert nicely or at all using ps2ai.ps. So a native pstoedit
       driver would be much better. Anyone out there to take this? The AI
       format is usable for example by Mayura Draw (http://www.mayura.com).
       Also a driver to the Mayura native format would be nice.

       An alternative to the ps2ai based driver is available via the -f
       plot:ai format if the libplot(ter) is installed.

       You should use a version of Ghostscript greater than or equal to 6.00
       for using the ps2ai output format driver.

   METAPOST
       Note that, as far as Scott knows, MetaPost does not support
       PostScript's eofill. The MetaPost output format driver just converts
       eofill to fill, and issues a warning if verbose is set. Fortunately,
       very few PostScript programs rely on the even-odd fill rule, even
       though many specify it.

       For more on MetaPost see:

       http://tug.org/metapost

   CONTEXT FREE - CFDG
       The driver for the CFDG format (drvcfdg) defines one shape per page of
       PostScript, but only the first shape is actually rendered (unless the
       user edits the generated CFDG code, of course).  CFDG does not support
       multi-page output, so this probably is a reasonable thing to do.

       For more on Context Free see: http://www.contextfreeart.org/

   LaTeX2E
       *      LaTeX2e's picture environment is not very powerful. As a result,
              many elementary PostScript constructs are ignored -- fills, line
              thicknesses (besides "thick" and "thin"), and dash patterns, to
              name a few. Furthermore, complex pictures may overrun TeX's
              memory capacity.  (The eepic package overcomes many such
              restrictions.)

       *      Some PostScript constructs are not supported directly by
              "picture", but can be handled by external packages. If a figure
              uses color, the top-level document will need to do a
              "\usepackage{color}" or "\usepackage{xcolor}". And if a figure
              contains rotated text, the top-level document will need to do a
              "\usepackage{rotating}".

       *      All lengths, coordinates, and font sizes output by the output
              format driver are in terms of \unitlength, so scaling a figure
              is simply a matter of doing a "\setlength{\unitlength}{...}".

       *      The output format driver currently supports one output format
              driver specific option, "integers", which rounds all lengths,
              coordinates, and font sizes to the nearest integer. This makes
              hand-editing the picture a little nicer.

       *      Why is this output format driver useful?  One answer is
              portability; any LaTeX2e system can handle the picture
              environment, even if it cannot handle PostScript graphics.
              (pdfLaTeX comes to mind here.) A second answer is that pictures
              can be edited easily to contain any arbitrary LaTeX2e code. For
              instance, the text in a figure can be modified to contain
              complex mathematics, non-Latin alphabets, bibliographic
              citations, or -- the real reason Scott wrote the LaTeX2e output
              format driver -- hyperlinks to the surrounding document (with
              help from the hyperref package).

   CREATING A NEW OUTPUT FORMAT DRIVER
       To implement a new output format driver you can start from drvsampl.cpp
       and drvsampl.h.  See also comments in drvbase.h and drvfuncs.h for an
       explanation of methods that should be implemented for a new output
       format driver.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       A default PostScript interpreter to be called by pstoedit is specified
       at compile time. You can overwrite the default by setting the GS
       environment variable to the name of a suitable PostScript interpreter.

       You can check which name of a PostScript interpreter was compiled into
       pstoedit using: pstoedit -help -v.

       See the Ghostscript manual for descriptions of environment variables
       used by Ghostscript, most importantly GS_FONTPATH and GS_LIB; other
       environment variables also affect output to display, print, and
       additional filtering and processing. See the related documentation.

       pstoedit allocates temporary files using the function tempnam(3).  Thus
       the location for temporary files might be controllable by other
       environment variables used by this function. See the tempnam(3)
       man-page for descriptions of environment variables used. On UNIX like
       system this is probably the TMPDIR variable, on DOS/WINDOWS either TMP
       or TEMP.

TROUBLE SHOOTING
       If you have problems with pstoedit first try whether Ghostscript
       successfully displays your file. If yes, then try pstoedit -f ps
       infile.ps testfile.ps and check whether testfile.ps still displays
       correctly using Ghostscript. If this file does not look correctly then
       there seems to be a problem with pstoedit's PostScript front-end. If
       this file looks good but the output for a specific format is wrong, the
       problem is probably in the output format driver for the specific
       format. In either case send bug fixes and reports to the author.

       A common problem with PostScript files is that the PostScript file
       redefines one of the standard PostScript operators inconsistently.
       There is no effect of this if you just print the file since the
       original PostScript "program" uses these new operators in the new
       meaning and does not use the original ones anymore. However, when run
       under the control of pstoedit, these operators are expected to work
       with the original semantics.

       So far I've seen redefinitions for:

       *      lt - "less-then" to mean "draw a line to"

       *      string - "create a string object" to mean "draw a string"

       *      length - "get the length of e.g. a string" to a "float constant"

       I've included work-arounds for the ones mentioned above, but some
       others could show up in addition to those.

RESTRICTIONS
       *      Non-standard fonts (e.g. TeX bitmap fonts) are mapped to a
              default font which can be changed using the -df option. pstoedit
              chooses the size of the replacement font such that the width of
              the string in the original font is the same as with the
              replacement font. This is done for each text fragment displayed.
              Special character encoding support is limited in this case. If a
              character cannot be mapped into the target format, pstoedit
              displays a '#' instead. See also the -uchar option.

       *      pstoedit supports bitmap graphics only for some output format
              drivers.

       *      Some output format drivers, e.g. the Gnuplot output format
              driver or the 3D output format driver (rpl, lwo, rib) do not
              support text.

       *      For most output format drivers pstoedit does not support
              clipping (mainly due to limitations in the target format). You
              can try to use the -sclip option to simulate clipping. However,
              this does not work in all cases as expected.

       *      Special note about the Java output format drivers (java1 and
              java2).  The java output format drivers generate a java source
              file that needs other files in order to be compiled and usable.
              These other files are Java classes (one applet and support
              classes) that allow stepping through the individual pages of a
              converted PostScript document. This applet can easily be
              activated from a HTML-document. See the
              contrib/java/java1/readme_java1.txt or
              contrib/java/java2/readme_java2.htm files for more details.

FAQS
       1.     Why do letters like O or B get strange if converted to TGIF/XFIG
              using the -dt option?

       Most output format drivers do not support composite paths with
       intermediate gaps (moveto's) and second do not support very well the
       (eo)fill operators of PostScript (winding rule). For such objects
       pstoedit breaks them into smaller objects whenever such a gap is found.
       This results in the "hole" being filled with black color instead of
       being transparent. Since version 3.11 you can try the -ssp option in
       combination with the XFIG output format driver.

       2.     Why does pstoedit produce ugly results from PostScript files
              generated by dvips?

       This is because TeX documents usually use bitmap fonts. Such fonts
       cannot be used as native font in other format. So pstoedit replaces the
       TeX font with another native font. Of course, the replacement font will
       in most cases produce another look, especially if mathematical symbols
       are used.  Try to use PostScript fonts instead of the bitmap fonts when
       generating a PostScript file from TeX or LaTeX.
