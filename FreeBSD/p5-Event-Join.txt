NAME
       Event::Join - join multiple "events" into one

SYNOPSIS
           use Event::Join;

           my $joiner = Event::Join->new(
               on_completion => sub {
                   my $events = shift;
                   say 'Child exited with status '. $events->{child_done};
               },
               events => [qw/stdout_closed child_done/],
           );

           watch_fh $stdout, on_eof  => sub { $joiner->send_event('stdout_closed') };
           watch_child $pid, on_exit => sub { $joiner->send_event('child_done', $_[0]) };

           start_main_loop;

DESCRIPTION
       When writing event-based programs, you often want to wait for a number
       of events to occur, and then do something.  This module allows you to
       do that without blocking.  It simply acts as a receiver for a number of
       events, and then calls a callback when all events have occurred.

       Note that although I mainly use this for "real" event-based
       programming, the technique is rather versatile.  A config file parser
       could be implemented like this:

          my $parsed_doc;
          my $parser_state = Event::Join->new(
              events        => [qw/username password machine_name/],
              on_completion => sub { $parsed_doc = shift },
          );

          while(!$parsed_doc && (my $line = <$fh>)){
              chomp $line;
              my ($k, $v) = split /:/, $line;
              $parser_state->send_event($k, $v);
          }

          say 'Username is '. $parsed_doc->{username};

METHODS
   new
       Create an instance.  Needs to be passed "events", an arrayref of valid
       event names, and "on_completion", a coderef to call after all events
       have been received.  This coderef is passed a hashref of events and
       their values, and will only ever be called once (or not at all, if the
       events never arrive).

   send_event( $event_name, [$event_value] )
       Send an event.  $event_name is required, and must be an event that was
       passed to the constructor.  An exception will be thrown if the name is
       not valid.

       $event_value is optional; is is the value that goes into the hash to be
       passed to the callback.  It can be true or false -- its value does not
       affect whether or not the completino callback is called.

       Finally, an exception is thrown if an event is sent more than once.

   event_sent( $event_name )
       Returns true if the event has been sent, false otherwise.  Note that
       the true value is not the value that was passed to "send_event", it is
       just an arbitrary non-false value.

   event_sender_for( $event_name )
       Returns a coderef that sends $event_name when run.  The first argument
       to the coderef will become the second argument to "send_event".
