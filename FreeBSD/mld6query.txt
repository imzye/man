MLD6QUERY(8)            FreeBSD System Manager's Manual           MLD6QUERY(8)

NAME
     mld6query – send multicast listener query

SYNOPSIS
     mld6query [-dgr] intface [maddr]

DESCRIPTION
     The mld6query utility sends an IPv6 multicast listener discovery (MLD)
     query packet toward the specified multicast address, maddr, toward
     interface intface.  If you omit maddr, linklocal all nodes multicast
     address(ff02::1) is used.

     After sending a query, mld6query waits for replies for at most 10
     seconds.  If a reply is returned, mld6query prints it with its type and
     then waits for another reply.

     This program is provided only for debugging.  It is not necessary for
     normal use.

     With -g, mld6query will transmit a General Query instead of the default
     Multicast-Address-Specific Query.  With -d, mld6query will transmit MLD
     done packet instead of MLD query packet.  With -r, similarly, MLD report
     packet will be transmitted.  -dr options are for debugging purposes only.

EXIT STATUS
     The program exits with 0 on success, non-zero on failures.

HISTORY
     The mld6query utility first appeared in WIDE/KAME IPv6 protocol stack
     kit.

BUGS
     The mld6query utility does not take care of multicast addresses which
     have non link-local scope.
