PLAYERCTL(1)            FreeBSD General Commands Manual           PLAYERCTL(1)

NAME
     playerctl – control media players via MPRIS

SYNOPSIS
     playerctl [-aFhlV] [-f FORMAT] [-i NAME] [-p NAME] command

DESCRIPTION
     The playerctl utility controls MPRIS-enabled media players.  In addition
     to offering play, pause and stop control, playerctl also offers previous
     and next track support, the ability to seek backwards and forwards in a
     track, and volume control.  playerctl also supports displaying metadata
     (e.g., artist, title, album) for the current track, and showing the
     status of the player.

     Players that can be controlled using playerctl include audacious(1),
     cmus(1), mopidy(1), mpd(1), quodlibet(1), rhythmbox(1), vlc(1) and
     xmms2(1).  However, any player that implements the MPRIS interface
     specification can be controlled using playerctl including web browsers.

     Playerctl also comes with a daemon called playerctld which keeps track of
     media player activity. When playerctld is running, playerctl commands
     will act on the media player with the most recent activity.  Run the
     command playerctld daemon to start the daemon.

     The options are as follows:

     -a, --all-players
             Apply command to all available players.

     -F, --follow
             Block and output the updated query when it changes.

     -f FORMAT, --format FORMAT
             Set the output of the current command to FORMAT.  See Format
             Strings.

     -h, --help
             Print this help, then exit.

     -i NAME, --ignore-player NAME
             Ignore the specific player NAME.  Multiple players can be
             specified in a comma-separated list.

     -l, --list-all
             List the names of running players that can be controlled.

     -p NAME, --player NAME
             Control the specific player NAME.  Multiple players can be
             specified in a comma-separated list.  Defaults to the first
             available player.  The name "name" matches both "name" and
             "name.{INSTANCE}".  Additionally, the name "%any" matches any
             player.

     -s, --no-messages
             Silence some diagnostic and error messages.

     -V, --version
             Print version number, then exit.

     The commands are as follows:

     status  Get the current status of the player.

     play    Command the player to play.

     pause   Command the player to pause.

     play-pause
             Command the player to toggle between play and pause.

     stop    Command the player to stop.

     next    Command the player to skip to the next track.

     previous
             Command the player to skip to the previous track.

     position [OFFSET[+|-]]
             Print the position of the current track in seconds.  With OFFSET
             specified, seek to OFFSET seconds from the start of the current
             track.  With the optional [+|-] appended, seek forward or
             backward OFFSET seconds from the current position.

     volume [LEVEL[+|-]]
             Print the player's volume scaled from 0.0 (0%) to 1.0 (100%).
             With LEVEL specified, set the player's volume to LEVEL.  With the
             optional [+|-] appended, increase or decrease the player's volume
             by LEVEL.

     metadata [KEY]
             Print all metadata properties for the current track set by the
             current player.  If KEY is specified only the value of KEY is
             printed.

     open URI
             Open URI in the player.  URI may be the name of a file or an
             external URL.

     shuffle [On | Off | Toggle]
             Print the shuffle status of the player.  With the shuffle status
             specified, set the shuffle status to either On , Off , or Toggle

     loop [None | Track | Playlist]
             Print the loop status of the player.  With the loop status
             specified, set the loop status to None (disable looping), Track
             (loop the current track), or Playlist (loop the current
             playlist).

   Format Strings
     The output of the position, metadata, status and volume commands can be
     controlled using a format string.  Variables set by these commands can be
     included in the format string by enclosing them in curly braces:
     ‘{{var}}’.  These will then be expanded on output.

     Each command has access to the following variables:

     playerName
             The name of the current player.

     position
             The time position of the current track, in microseconds.

     status  The status of the current player.

     volume  The player's volume scaled from 0.0 (0%) to 1.0 (100%).

     Each property listed in the metadata command are also set as variables.
     It is recommended to check this list for each player, as different
     players may not set the same properties.  See the MPRIS v2 metadata
     guidelines for a list of all properties in the MPRIS specification.  The
     most common properties are as follows:

     album, xesam:album
             The album of the current track.

     artist, xesam:artist
             The artist of the current track.

     title, xesam:title
             The title of the current track.

     Helper functions are also available to transform expanded variables into
     other representations.  They are called in the form ‘{{func(var)}}’.  The
     helper functions are as follows:

     lc(str)
             Convert string str to lowercase.

     uc(str)
             Convert string str to uppercase.

     markup_escape(str)
             Escape XML characters in string str.

     default(str1, str2)
             Print str1 if set, else print str2.

     duration(time)
             Reformat the microsecond timestamp time in the form ‘hh:mm:ss’.
             Can only be called with position or mpris:length.

     emoji(key)
             Try to convert the value for key to an emoji representation.
             Currently implemented for status and volume.

     The template language is also able to perform basic math operations.

     References to unknown functions will cause playerctl to exit with an
     error.  References to unknown variables will be expanded to empty
     strings.  Text not enclosed in braces will be printed verbatim.

EXIT STATUS
     The playerctl utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Print the player name, playback status in lowercase, and position and
     length in human readable form:

           $ playerctl metadata --format '{{playerName}}: {{lc(status)}} '\
           '{{duration(position)}}|{{duration(mpris:length)}}'
