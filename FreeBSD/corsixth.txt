DESCRIPTION
     CorsixTH is a reimplementation of the 1997 Bullfrog business simulation
     game Theme Hospital.  As well as faithfully recreating the original,
     CorsixTH adds support for modern operating systems, high resolution
     displays, and much more.  A purchased copy of Theme Hospital, or the
     Theme Hospital demo is required to use CorsixTH.
