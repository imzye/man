NAME
       Encode::compat - Encode.pm emulation layer

VERSION
       This document describes version 0.07 of Encode::compat, released June
       3, 2004.

SYNOPSIS
           use Encode::compat; # a no-op for Perl v5.7.1+
           use Encode qw(...); # all constants and imports works transparently

           # use Encode functions as normal

DESCRIPTION
       WARNING: THIS IS A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT.  Most functions are incomplete.
       All implementation details are subject to change!

       This module provide a compatibility layer for Encode.pm users on perl
       versions earlier than v5.7.1.  It translates whatever call it receives
       into Text::Iconv, or (in the future) Unicode::MapUTF8 to perform the
       actual work.

       The is_utf8(), _utf8_on() and _utf8_off() calls are performed by the
       method native to the perl version -- 5.6.1 would use "pack"/"unpack",
       5.6.0 uses "tr//CU", etc.

       Theoretically, it could be backported to 5.005 and earlier, with none
       of the unicode-related semantics available, and serves only as a
       abstraction layer above "Text::Iconv", "Unicode::MapUTF8" and possibly
       other transcoding modules.

CAVEATS
       Currently, this module only support 5.6.1+, and merely provides the
       three utility function above (encode(), decode() and from_to()), with a
       very kludgy "FB_HTMLCREF" fallback against "latin-1" in from_to().
