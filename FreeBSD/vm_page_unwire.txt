VM_PAGE_WIRE(9)        FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual       VM_PAGE_WIRE(9)

NAME
     vm_page_wire, vm_page_unwire, vm_page_unwire_noq – wire and unwire pages

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <vm/vm.h>
     #include <vm/vm_page.h>

     void
     vm_page_wire(vm_page_t m);

     bool
     vm_page_wire_mapped(vm_page_t m);

     void
     vm_page_unwire(vm_page_t m, int queue);

     bool
     vm_page_unwire_noq(vm_page_t m);

DESCRIPTION
     The vm_page_wire() and vm_page_wire_mapped() functions wire the page,
     which prevents it from being reclaimed by the page daemon or when its
     containing object is destroyed.  Both functions require that the page
     belong to an object.  The vm_page_wire_mapped() function is for use by
     the pmap(9) layer following a lookup.  This function may fail if mappings
     of the page are concurrently being destroyed, in which case it will
     return false.

     The vm_page_unwire() and vm_page_unwire_noq() functions release a wiring
     of a page.  The vm_page_unwire() function takes a queue index and will
     insert the page into the corresponding page queue upon releasing its last
     wiring.  If the page does not belong to an object and no other references
     to the page exist, vm_page_unwire() will free the page.
     vm_page_unwire_noq() releases the wiring and returns true if it was the
     last wiring of the page.
