Perl::Critic::Bangs(3)                     User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Perl::Critic::Bangs - A collection of handy Perl::Critic policies

VERSION
       Version 1.08

SYNOPSIS
       Perl::Critic::Bangs is a collection of Perl::Critic policies that will
       help make your code better.

DESCRIPTION
       The rules included with the Perl::Critic::Bangs group include:

   Perl::Critic::Policy::Bangs::ProhibitCommentedOutCode
       Commented-out code is usually noise.  It should be removed.

   Perl::Critic::Policy::Bangs::ProhibitFlagComments
       Watch for comments like "XXX", "TODO", etc.

   Perl::Critic::Policy::Bangs::ProhibitNoPlan
       Tests should have a plan.

   Perl::Critic::Policy::Bangs::ProhibitNumberedNames
       Variables like $user and $user2 are insufficiently distinguished.

   Perl::Critic::Policy::Bangs::ProhibitRefProtoOrProto
       Determining the class in a constructor by using "ref($proto) || $proto"
       is usually a cut-n-paste that is incorrect.

   Perl::Critic::Policy::Bangs::ProhibitUselessRegexModifiers
       Adding modifiers to a regular expression made up entirely of a variable
       created with qr() is usually not doing what you expect.

   Perl::Critic::Policy::Bangs::ProhibitVagueNames
       Vague variables like $data or $info are not descriptive enough.

WHY IS IT CALLED Perl::Critic::Bangs?
       I didn't want to call it "Perl::Critic::Lester" or
       "Perl::Critic::Petdance" that would make it sound like they were only
       my rules.  Other people will likely include their own set of rules,
       too.

       So I started thinking of names of famous critics.  Ebert, Siskel, Kael,
       etc. What about music critics?  Greil Marcus, J.D. Considine...  Lester
       Bangs!  He's even got my name in his!  So there was the name.

       See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_Bangs for more on Lester Bangs.
