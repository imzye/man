NAME
       Ypsilon - The implementation of Scheme Programming Language for real-
       time applications

SYNOPSIS
       ypsilon [ options ] [--] [ file ] [ arguments ]

DESCRIPTION
       Ypsilon implements full features of R6RS and R6RS standard libraries
       including:

              arbitrary precision integer arithmetic
              rational number
              exact and inexact complex number
              implicitly phased library
              top-level program
              proper tail recursion
              call/cc and dynamic wind
              unicode
              bytevectors
              records
              exceptions and conditions
              i/o
              syntax-case
              hashtables
              enumerations

       More libraries are included to support a wide variety of software
       development.

       Ypsilon reads scheme scripts from files, streams, or prompts.
       Then, it compiles the scripts to intermediate codes for evaluation.
       Compiled codes will be cached automaticaly to speeding up the edit/run
       cycle.

       Ypsilon implements "mostly concurrent mark and sweep garbage
       collector".
       It is optimized to achieve a remarkably short pause time which is
       essential for the best quality real-time video games.

OPTIONS
       --mute, -m
              Suppresses greeting.

       --quiet, -q
              Suppresses greeting, repl prompt, and repl output.

       --verbose, -v
              Prints load and compile activities.

       --warning, -w
              Prints warnings.

       --interactive, -i
              Enters repl after running the script file.

       --r6rs, -6
              Conforms R6RS top-level program syntax.
              #!r6rs directive is available to be used in the script files for
              the precise control.

       --compatible, -c
              Extends the lexical syntax for the compatibility of the existing
              scripts.
              For example, the reader reads '1+', '@1', '.n', and '|u v|' as
              identifiers.
              #!compatible directive is available to be used in the script
              files for the precise control.

       --sitelib=path
              Adds sitelib path.
              The path is a colon-separated list of directories.
              See also YPSILON_SITELIB in the ENVIRONMENT section.

       --loadpath=path
              Adds load search path.
              The path is a colon-separated list of directories.
              See also YPSILON_LOADPATH in the ENVIRONMENT section.

       --acc=dir
              Sets a auto-compile-cache directory.
              See also YPSILON_ACC in the ENVIRONMENT section.

       --heap-limit=mbytes
              Sets a total heap limit in mbytes.

       --dump-condition
              Default exception handler prints all components of the
              condition.

       --disable-acc
              Disables the auto-compile-cache.

       --clean-acc
              Cleans up the auto-compile-cache.

       --version
              Prints the version and exits.

       --help Prints help and exit.

       --     Indicates no more option to proceed.

ENVIRONMENT
       YPSILON_SITELIB
              A colon-separated list of the sitelib directories.  Ypsilon
              traverses the sitelib directories to find a library before
              looking up the system default directory.

       YPSILON_LOADPATH
              A colon-separated list of the script file directories.  Ypsilon
              traverses directories to find a script file to be loaded.

       YPSILON_ACC
              This is a auto-compile-cache directory.  The directory must be
              created in advance as Ypsilon saves compiled codes in it.
