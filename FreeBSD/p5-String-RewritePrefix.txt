String::RewritePrefix(3)                   User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       String::RewritePrefix - rewrite strings based on a set of known
       prefixes

VERSION
       version 0.009

SYNOPSIS
         use String::RewritePrefix;
         my @to_load = String::RewritePrefix->rewrite(
           { '' => 'MyApp::', '+' => '' },
           qw(Plugin Mixin Addon +Corporate::Thinger),
         );

         # now you have:
         qw(MyApp::Plugin MyApp::Mixin MyApp::Addon Corporate::Thinger)

       You can also import a rewrite routine:

         use String::RewritePrefix rewrite => {
           -as => 'rewrite_dt_prefix',
           prefixes => { '' => 'MyApp::', '+' => '' },
         };

         my @to_load = rewrite_dt_prefix( qw(Plugin Mixin Addon +Corporate::Thinger));

         # now you have:
         qw(MyApp::Plugin MyApp::Mixin MyApp::Addon Corporate::Thinger)

PERL VERSION
       This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates
       from the Perl 5 Porters.  This means it should work on any version of
       perl released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the most
       recently released version is v5.40, then this module should work on
       both v5.40 and v5.38.)

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made
       that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version
       may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

METHODS
   rewrite
         String::RewritePrefix->rewrite(\%prefix, @strings);

       This rewrites all the given strings using the rules in %prefix.  Its
       keys are known prefixes for which its values will be substituted.  This
       is performed in longest-first order, and only one prefix will be
       rewritten.

       If the prefix value is a coderef, it will be executed with the
       remaining string as its only argument.  The return value will be used
       as the prefix.
