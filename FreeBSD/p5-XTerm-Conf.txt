NAME
       XTerm::Conf - change configuration of a running xterm

SYNOPSIS
           use XTerm::Conf;
           xterm_conf(-fg => "white", -bg => "black", -title => "Hello, world", ...);

DESCRIPTION
       XTerm::Conf provides functions to change some aspects of a running
       xterm and compatible terminal emulators (e.g. rxvt or urxvt).

   xterm_conf(options ...)
       The xterm_conf function (exported by default) checks first if the
       current terminal looks like an xterm, rxvt or urxvt (by looking at the
       "TERM" environment variable) and prints the escape sequences for the
       following options:

       "-n string"
       "-iconname string"
           Change name of the associated X11 icon.

       "-T string"
       "-title string"
           Change xterm's title name.

       "-fg color"
       "-foreground color"

           "#rrggbb" notation.

       "-background color"
           Change background color.

       "-cs utf-8|iso-8859-1"

           rxvt only?

           ???

       "-[no]reversewraparound"
           ???

       "-geometry geometry"
           Change the geometry of the xterm window. The geometry is in the
           usual X11 notation widthxheight+left+top. The numbers are in
           pixels. The width and height may be suffixed with a "c", which
           means that the numbers are interpreted as characters.

           Lower the xterm window

       "-xproperty ..."
       "-x11property ..."
           ???

       "-font number"
           Change font. Number may be from 0 (default font) to 6 (usually the
           largest font, but this could be changed using Xdefaults).

       "-nextfont"
           Use the next font in list.

       "-prevfont"
           Use the previous font in list.

       "-report what"
           Report to "STDOUT":

           "status"
               Return 1.

           "cursorpos"
               The cursor position (line column).

           "windowpos"
               The XTerm window position (x y).

           "geometry"
               The geometry of the window in pixels (width height).

           "cgeometry"
               The geometry of the window in characters (width"x"height).

           "cscreengeom"
               ???

           "iconname"
               The icon name. This may only be available if the allowWindowOps
               resource is set to true (e.g. using

                   xterm -xrm "*allowWindowOps:true"

               ). On some operating systems and some terminal emulators (most
               notable "rxvt" on Debian/Ubuntu systems) this operation may be
               forbidden completely.

           "title"
               The title name. See "iconname" for possible restrictions on
               availability.

       "-debugreport"
           If set together with a "-report ..." option, then print the
           returned escape sequence as numbers to "STDOUT" (as an debugging
           aid).

       "-resize integer"
           ???

   xterm_conf_string(options ...)
       xterm_conf_string just returns a string with the escape sequences for
       the given options (same as in xterm_conf). No terminal check will be
       performed here.

       xterm_conf_string may be exported.

   terminal_is_supported(term)
       Return a true value if the given term, or if missing, the current
       terminal as given by $ENV{TERM}, is supported.

       This function may be exported.
