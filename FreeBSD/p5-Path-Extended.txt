NAME
       Path::Extended - yet another Path class

SYNOPSIS
           use Path::Extended;
           my $file   = file('path/to/file.txt');
           my $dir    = dir('path/to/somewhere');

           my $maybe_file = file_or_dir('path/to/file_or_dir');
           my $maybe_dir  = dir_or_file('path/to/file_or_dir');

DESCRIPTION
       This is yet another file/directory handler that does a bit more than
       Path::Class for some parts, and a bit less for other parts. One of the
       main difference is Path::Extended always tries to use forward slashes
       when possible, ie. even when you're on the MS Windows, so that you
       don't need to care about escaping paths that annoys you from time to
       time when you want to apply regexen to a path, especially in file tests
       that use 'like' or 'compare'.

       Also, Path::Extended can do some basic file/directory operations such
       as copy, move, and rename as well as file I/O stuff like open, close,
       and slurp (and some of these may behave differently from the
       equivalents of Path::Class).

       On the other hand, Path::Extended doesn't care (or care little) about
       converting foreign path names or ascending/descending path tree.

       In short, this is not for manipulating a path name itself, but for
       doing some meaningful thing to or with something the path points to.

CAVEATS
       Path::Extended always holds an absolute path of a file/directory
       internally, even when you pass a relative path (instead of
       volume/directory/basename combo as Path::Class does). And this is done
       by File::Spec, which tends to confuse when you set a wrong $^O just to
       use unix-style path name (as File::Spec fails to determine if the path
       is relative or not). So, don't pretend.

FUNCTIONS
       All of these four functions are exported by default.

   file
       takes a file path and returns a Path::Extended::File object. The file
       doesn't need to exist.

   dir
       takes a directory path and returns a Path::Extended::Dir object. The
       directory doesn't need to exist.

   file_or_dir
       takes a file/directory path and returns a Path::Extended::File object
       if it doesn't point to an existing directory (if it does point to a
       directory, it returns a Path::Extended::Dir object). This is handy if
       you don't know a path is a file or a directory. You can tell which is
       the case by calling ->is_dir method (if it's a file, ->is_dir returns
       false, otherwise true).

   dir_or_file
       does the same above but Path::Extended::Dir has precedence.

KNOWN LIMITATIONS
       Apparently this slash-converting approach of Path::Extended doesn't
       work under some environments like (older) MacPerl that allow slashes in
       a file name.

       I'm not sure if I should also convert other separators like colons (:)
       to forward slashes under those environments, though I believe most of
       you (at least you of programmers) won't use slashes in file names no
       matter what OSes you use. This conversion may break things sometimes
       but one of the main aims of this module is not to break tests just
       because path separators differ, and tests usually don't require OS-
       specific paths, so I may convert them in the future releases. Patches
       and suggestions are welcome.
