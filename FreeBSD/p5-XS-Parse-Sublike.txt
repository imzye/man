NAME
       "Sublike::Extended" - enable extended features when parsing "sub"-like
       syntax

SYNOPSIS
          use v5.26;
          use Sublike::Extended;
          use experimental 'signatures';

          extended sub greet (:$name = "world") {
             say "Hello, $name";
          }

          greet( name => $ENV{USER} );

       Or, since version 0.29:

          use v5.26;
          use Sublike::Extended 0.29 'sub';
          use experimental 'signatures';

          sub greet (:$name = "world") {
             say "Hello, $name";
          }

          greet( name => $ENV{USER} );

DESCRIPTION
       This module extends the syntax for declaring named or anonymous
       subroutines using Perl's builtin "sub" keyword, or other similar
       keywords provided by third-party modules, to enable parsing of extra
       features.

       By default, this module provides a new keyword, "extended", which
       parses the extra syntax required. Optionally since version 0.29, this
       module can additionally take over the handling of the "sub" keyword
       itself, allowing this extra syntax to be used without the "extended"
       prefix keyword.  As this ability may be surprising to unsuspecting
       readers, this is not done by default and must be explicitly requested
       with the "sub" import argument:

          use Sublike::Extended 'sub';

       On Perl 5.38 or above, this can also take over handling of the "method"
       keyword when using "feature 'class'".

          use Sublike::Extended 'method';

       Currently, the only extended features that are provided are related to
       the parsing of a subroutine signature. Since signatures are only
       available on Perl version 5.26 or later, this module is unlikely to be
       useful in earlier versions of Perl.

   Named parameters
       Extended subroutines can declare named parameters in the signature,
       after any positional ones. These take the form of a name prefixed by a
       colon character.  The caller of such a function should pass values for
       these parameters by the usual name-value pair syntax that would be used
       for passing into a regular hash. Within the body of the subroutine the
       values passed into these are unpacked into regular lexical variables.

          sub colour (:$red, :$green, :$blue) {
             ... # $red, $green and $blue are available as regular lexicals
          }

          # argument order at the caller site is not important
          colour(green => 1, blue => 2, red => 3);

       Positional parameters can be placed after optional positional ones, but
       in order to make use of them the caller would have to pass a value for
       every positional parameter including the optional ones first. This is
       unlikely to be very useful; if you want to have optional parameters and
       named parameters, use named optional ones after any mandatory
       positional parameters.

       As with positional parameters, they are normally mandatory, but can be
       made optional by supplying a defaulting expression. If the caller fails
       to pass a value corresponding to an optional parameter, the default
       expression is evaluated and used instead.

          sub f (:$x0, :$x1, :$x2 = 0) { ... }
          # The caller must provide x0 and x1, but x2 is optional

       Since version 0.23 named parameters can be given defaulting expressions
       with the "//=" or "||=" operators, meaning their defaults apply also if
       the caller passed a present-but-undef, or present-but-false value.

          sub f (:$x0, :$x1, :$x2 //= 0) { ... }
          # $x2 will be set to 0 even if the caller passes  x2 => undef

       An optional slurpy hash or (since version 0.24) slurpy array is also
       permitted after all of these. It will contain the values of any other
       name-value pairs given by the caller, after those corresponding to
       named parameters have already been extracted.

          sub g (:$alpha, :$beta, %rest) { ... }

          sub g (:$alpha, :$beta, @rest) { ... }

       In the case of a slurpy array, it will contain every argument value
       that was not consumed as a named parameter pair, in the original order
       passed by the caller, including any duplicates.

   Parameter Attributes
       Parameters to extended subroutines can use attribute syntax to apply
       extra attributes to individual parameters.

          sub info ($x :Attribute) { ... }

       Any attributes that are available are ones that have been previously
       registered with XS::Parse::Sublike using its XS-level API. The
       particular behaviour of such an attribute would be defined by whatever
       module provided the attribute.

KEYWORDS
   extended
          extended sub NAME (SIGNATURE...) { BODY... }

          extended sub (SIGNATURE...) { BODY... };

       This prefix keyword enables extra parsing features when handling a
       "sub" (or other sub-like function keyword).

       This keyword can be freely mixed with other "sub"-prefix keywords, such
       as "async" from Future::AsyncAwait

          async extended sub f (:$param) { ... }

       This can also be used with other keywords that provide "sub"-like
       syntax, such as "method" from Object::Pad or the core "use feature
       'class'".

          extended method f (:$param) { ... }

TODO
       •   Support defined-or and true-or positional parameters even on
           versions of Perl before they were officially added (v5.38).
