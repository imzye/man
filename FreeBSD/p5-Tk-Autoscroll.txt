NAME
       Tk::Autoscroll - space invaders-like scrolling

SYNOPSIS
           use Tk::Autoscroll;
           Tk::Autoscroll::Init($widget);

DESCRIPTION
       This lets you enable scrolling similar to the one in Microsoft
       Explorer. Press the middle mouse button and then move the mouse to
       scroll the widget. A further press on the middle button stops the
       scrolling.

       It is also possible to use the autoscrolling feature for all Scrolled()
       widgets automatically. To do so, you have to write

           use Tk::Autoscroll 'as_default';

FUNCTIONS
   Init($widget, [options ...])
       Possible options:

       -trigger
           Default value is "<Button-2>"

       -stoptrigger
           An event to stop autoscrolling. Normally, this is not defined
           meaning that autoscrolling will stop if Button-2 is pressed again.
           If "-stoptrigger" is set to "<ButtonRelease-2>", then the user have
           to hold the middle button down to autoscroll and autoscrolling will
           stop if the user releases the button.

       -speed
           Values are "slow", "normal" and "fast". Default value is "normal".

       -beforestartcommand, -afterstartcommand, -beforestopcommand,
       -afterstopcommand
           Commands which are executed before/after beginning/ending
           autoscroll operation. Note that only subroutine references are
           allowed, but not perl/Tk callbacks (i.e. the [ ] notation). The
           "-before" callbacks should return true, otherwise the operation is
           cancelled.

       If you want to apply any "Init" options to all widgets when using
       "as_default", then you can define the global variable @default_args.
       Example:

           @Tk::Autoscroll::default_args = (-stoptrigger => '<ButtonRelease-2>');

   Reset($widget)
       Remove the binding, scrolling is not possible anymore.

BUGS
       The import() function could be better implemented, i.e. avoiding the
       duplicate of Scrolled() definition.

       Any motion binding for the widget is overwritten.

       Reset() should probably restore all used bindings.
