NAME
       Authen::OATH - OATH One Time Passwords

VERSION
       Version 1.0.0

SYNOPSIS
       Implementation of the HOTP and TOTP One Time Password algorithms as
       defined by OATH (http://www.openauthentication.org)

       All necessary parameters are set by default, though these can be
       overridden. Both totp() and htop() have passed all of the test vectors
       defined in the RFC documents for TOTP and HOTP.

       totp() and hotp() both default to returning 6 digits and using SHA1.
       As such, both can be called by passing only the secret key and a valid
       OTP will be returned.

           use Authen::OATH;

           my $oath = Authen::OATH->new();
           my $totp = $oath->totp( "MySecretPassword" );
           my $hotp = $oath->hotp( "MyOtherSecretPassword" );

       Parameters may be overridden when creating the new object:

           my $oath = Authen::OATH->new( 'digits' => 8 );

       The three parameters are "digits", "digest", and "timestep."  Timestep
       only applies to the totp() function.

       While strictly speaking this is outside the specifications of HOTP and
       TOTP, you can specify digests other than SHA1. For example:

           my $oath = Authen::OATH->new( "digits" => 10,
                                         "digest" => "Digest::MD6"
           );

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
   totp
           my $otp = $oath->totp( $secret [, $manual_time ] );

       Manual time is an optional parameter. If it is not passed, the current
       time is used. This is useful for testing purposes.

   hotp
           my $opt = $oath->hotp( $secret, $counter );

       Both parameters are required.

   _process
       This is an internal routine and is never called directly.
