Time::Piece::MySQL(3)                      User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Time::Piece::MySQL - Adds MySQL-specific methods to Time::Piece

SYNOPSIS
         use Time::Piece::MySQL;

         my $time = localtime;

         print $time->mysql_datetime;
         print $time->mysql_date;
         print $time->mysql_time;

         my $time = Time::Piece->from_mysql_datetime( $mysql_datetime );
         my $time = Time::Piece->from_mysql_date( $mysql_date );
         my $time = Time::Piece->from_mysql_timestamp( $mysql_timestamp );

DESCRIPTION
       Using this module instead of, or in addition to, "Time::Piece" adds a
       few MySQL-specific date-time methods to "Time::Piece" objects.

OBJECT METHODS
   mysql_date / mysql_time / mysql_datetime / mysql_timestamp
       Returns the date and/or time in a format suitable for use by MySQL.

CONSTRUCTORS
   from_mysql_date / from_mysql_datetime / from_mysql_timestamp
       Given a date, datetime, or timestamp value as returned from MySQL,
       these constructors return a new Time::Piece object.  If the value is
       NULL, they will retrun undef.

   CAVEAT
       "Time::Piece" itself only works with times in the Unix epoch, this
       module has the same limitation.  However, MySQL itself handles date and
       datetime columns from '1000-01-01' to '9999-12-31'.  Feeding in times
       outside of the Unix epoch to any of the constructors has unpredictable
       results.

       Also, MySQL doesn't validate dates (because your application should);
       it only checks that dates are in the right format.  So, your database
       might include dates like 2004-00-00 or 2001-02-31.  Passing invalid
       dates to any of the constructors is a bad idea: on my system the former
       type (with zeros) returns undef (previous version used to die) while
       the latter returns a date in the following month.
