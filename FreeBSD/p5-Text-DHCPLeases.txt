NAME
       Text::DHCPLeases - Parse DHCP leases file from ISC dhcpd.

SYNOPSIS
           use Text::DHCPLeases;

           my $leases = Text::DHCPLeases->new("/etc/dhcpd.leases");

           foreach my $obj ( $leases->get_objects ){
               print $obj->name;
               if ( $obj->binding_state eq 'active' ){
                  ...
           }
           ...

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides an object-oriented interface to ISC DHCPD leases
       files.  The goal is to objectify all declarations, as defined by the
       ISC dhcpd package man pages.

       This interface is useful for analyzing, reporting, converting lease
       files, or as a tool for other applications that need to import dhcpd
       lease data structures.

CLASS METHODS
   new - Class Constructor
         Arguments:
           Hash with the following keys:
           file  -  Leases file path
         Returns:
           Text::DHCPLeases object
         Examples:
           Text::DHCPLeases->new(file=>"/etc/dhcpd.leases");

INSTANCE METHODS
   get_objects - Get objects from leases file
         Arguments:
           Object attributes to match (optional)
         Returns:
           Array of Text::DHCPLeases::Lease objects,
           or iterator depending on context.
         Examples:
           my $it = $leases->get_objects(ip_address=>'192.168.0.1');
           while ( my $obj = $it->next ) ...

   print - Print all lease objects contents as a formatted string
         Arguments:
           None
         Returns:
           Formatted String
         Examples:
           print $leases->print;

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       Correct parsing of leases files depends on changes made to the format
       of said files by the authors of the ISC DHCPD package.  This module was
       tested against leases files generated by ISC DHCPD version 3.1.0.  In
       addition, I do not have access to leases file with all possible
       declarations and statements, so parsing could be broken in some
       circumstances.  Patches are welcome.

       No bugs have been reported.

       Please report any bugs or feature requests to
       "bug-Text-DHCPleases@rt.cpan.org", or through the web interface at
       <http://rt.cpan.org>.
