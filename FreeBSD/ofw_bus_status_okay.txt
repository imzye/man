ofw_bus_status_okay(9)                       FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual

NAME
     ofw_bus_get_status, ofw_bus_status_okay, ofw_bus_node_status_okay – check
     status of the device tree node

SYNOPSIS
     #include <dev/ofw/openfirm.h>
     #include <dev/ofw/ofw_bus.h>
     #include <dev/ofw/ofw_bus_subr.h>

     const char *
     ofw_bus_get_status(device_t dev);

     int
     ofw_bus_status_okay(device_t dev);

     int
     ofw_bus_node_status_okay(phandle_t node);

DESCRIPTION
     The "status" property of the device tree node indicates whether the
     device is enabled or not.  Multiple hardware versions might be built
     using the same base System-on-Chip but with a different set of blocks
     enabled.  It is common to use  SoC device tree and only enable/disable
     device nodes for the derivative boards.  The device tree node is
     considered enabled only if it has "status" property with the value set to
     either "ok" or "okay".

     ofw_bus_get_status() returns the value of the "status" property of the
     device tree node associated with the device dev.  If the node does not
     have "status" property or there is no node associated with the device the
     function returns NULL.

     ofw_bus_status_okay() returns 1 if the device tree node associated with
     the device dev has "status" property and its value is either "ok" or
     "okay".

     ofw_bus_node_status_okay() returns 1 if the device tree node node has
     "status" property and its value is either "ok" or "okay".
