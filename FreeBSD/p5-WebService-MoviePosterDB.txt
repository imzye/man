NAME
       WebService::MoviePosterDB - OO Perl interface to the movie poster
       database MoviePosterDB.

SYNOPSIS
           use WebService::MoviePosterDB;

           my $ws = WebService::MoviePosterDB->new(api_key => "key", api_secret => "secret", cache => 1, cache_exp => "12h");

           my $movie = $ws->search(type => "Movie", imdbid => "tt0114814", width => 300);

           print $movie->title(), ": \n\n";
           print $movie->page(), "\n\n";

           foreach ( @{$movie->posters()} ) {
               print $_->image_location(), "\n";
           }

DESCRIPTION
       WebService::MusicBrainz is an object-oriented interface to
       MoviePosterDB.  It can be used to retrieve artwork for IMDB titles.

METHODS
   new(%opts)
       Constructor.

       %opts can contain:

       api_key, api_secret
           A key and secret are required to use the API.  Contact
           movieposterdb.com for details.

       cache
           Whether to cache responses.  Defaults to true

       cache_root
           The root dir for the cache.  Defaults to tmpdir();

       cache_exp
           How long to cache responses for.  Defaults to "1h"

   search(type => "Movie", %args)
       Accesses MoviePosterDB and returns a WebService::MoviePosterDB::Movie
       object.

       %args can contain:

       type
           Controls the type of resource being requested.  Currently only
           supports "Movie".

       tconst
           IMDB id for the title, e.g. tt0114814

       imdbid
           Alias for tconst

       title
           Name of the title

       width
           Image width for returned artwork

NOTES
       The version 1 API, previously used by default, stopped as of
       2011-09-27, and credentials are required to access the version 2 API.
       It is possible to access the version 2 API using test credentials (key,
       secret = "demo"), and this will be done for legacy applications that
       try to use the version 1 API.  However, this feature is only intended
       for test purposes: legacy applications should be adapted, and new
       applications should not use it.
