NAME
       arbtt-stats - generate statistics from the arbtt data samples

SYNOPSIS
       arbtt-stats [OPTION...]

DESCRIPTION
       arbtt-stats reads the samples that were recorded so far by
       arbtt-capture from the log file, filters them according to the users
       specifications and generates one or more reports from the data.

       When run without any options, --total-time is assumed.

       The order in which filters (--exclude, --only, --also-inactive and
       --filter) and reports are passed to the program is irrelevant: All
       filters given on the command line are active for all reports.

OPTIONS
       -h, -?, --help
           shows a short summary of the available options, and exists.

       -V, --version
           shows the version number, and exists.

       --logfile FILE
           logfile to use instead of ~/.arbtt/capture.log

       --categorizefile
           categorize file to use instead of ~/.arbtt/categorize.cfg

   Filtering options
       -x TAG, --exclude TAG
           Ignore any data samples that have been assigned this tag or
           category. To distinguish tags and categories, the latter have to be
           entered followed by a colon. Can be given more than once.

       -o TAG, --only TAG
           Ignore any data samples that have not been assigned this tag. To
           distinguish tags and categories, the latter have to be entered
           followed by a colon. Can be given more than once.

       --also-inactive
           by default, arbtt-stats ignores any samples which have been
           assigned the tag inactive. This flag disables this behaviour.

       -f CONDITION, --filter CONDITION
           Only consider samples matching the given condition, which follows
           the same syntax as in categorize.cfg (Nonterminal Cond in the
           formal grammar specification found in the user guide).

   Report options
       -m PERCENTAGE, --min-percentage PERCENTAGE
           Ignore tags whose percentage is less than the value specified here.
           Default percentage: 1%.

       --output-exclude TAG
           Skip this tag or category when printing statistics. Only affects
           the reports --total-time and --category. To distinguish tags and
           categories, the latter have to be entered followed by a colon. Can
           be given more than once.

       --output-only TAG
           Prints statistics only for the specified tag or category. Only
           affects the reports --total-time and --category. To distinguish
           tags and categories, the latter have to be entered followed by a
           colon. Can be given more than once.

       --output-format FORMAT
           Specify the report output format, may be one of: text, csv
           (comma-separated values), tsv (TAB-separated values). Default
           format: text.

   Reports
       -i, --information
           Various bits of information about the recorded data, such as total
           time recorded, number of records etc. In this report, “time
           recorded” is the sum of all samples, including inactive and those
           that are disabled by the filter, while “time selected” is the sum
           of the samples that are matched by the given filters.

       -t, --total-time
           For all tags, print the part of the selected time with this tag
           applied to, both as an absolute value and a percentage of the
           selected time.

       -c CATEGORY, --category CATEGORY
           For the given category, give the textual equivalent of a pie chart:
           For each possible value of the category, including one for “no tag
           of this category present”, give the absolute time and fraction.
           Entries which are not displayed because of the option
           --min-percentage are aggregated.

       --each-category
           This is just a shortcut for a series of --category options, one for
           each category found in the data.

       --intervals [TAG|CATEGORY:]
           This report lists all periods of consecutive time intervals where
           the given tag has been applied to, or where the given category has
           the same value.

           To distinguish tags and categories, the latter have to be entered
           followed by a colon.

           This report will give wrong results if an activity has been carried
           out at the end of a session and right at the beginning, as the
           intermediate time is thought to be part of the interval. Inactive
           times while arbtt-capture is running will separate the results as
           expected.

       --for-each PERIOD
           This is not a report of its own, but causes the selected report to
           be executed for each of the given PERIOD (which can be minute,
           hour,day, month or year) where there exist selected samples. All
           the reports will then be printed one after another or, in the case
           of CSV output, with an additional column.

           Note that if this option is enabled, samples that are filtered out
           are completely ignored (to avoid empty reports for periods with
           only filtered samples). Therefore, the --information report will
           print the numbers for the samples selected also for the totals.

EXAMPLES
       Some useful examples of what you can do with arbtt-stats are provided
       here:

           # Only consider the time when I was programming in Haskell
           arbtt-stats -o Editing-Haskell

           # Tell me what evolution folders I spend my time in when I actually do
           # work with e-Mail
           arbtt-stats -o Program:evolution -c Evo-Folder

           # Generate statistics about the last hour
           arbtt-stats -f '$sampleage < 1:00'

FILES
       ~/.arbtt/capture.log
           binary file, storing the arbtt data samples

       ~/.arbtt/categorize.cfg
           specification of the arbtt categorizer syntax. A detailed
           description is given in the section called “Configuring the arbtt
           categorizer (arbtt-stats)”
