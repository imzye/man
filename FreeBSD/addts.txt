NAME
       addts - add timestamps at the beginning of each line

SYNOPSIS
       addts [-asu] [-f FMT] [-w CHR] [FILE]

       addts -?

DESCRIPTION
       Reads standard input and writes it to standard output, adding a
       timestamp at the begginning (or end) of each line. If FILE is suppied,
       writes to it instead. Typical usage is for Apache forensic log:

       ForensicLog "|/usr/bin/addts -a /var/log/httpd/forensic.log"

       To add timestamps to the end of each line, formatting it as an
       additional header:

       ForensicLog "|/usr/bin/addts -a -s -f '|X-TS:%c' /var/log/httpd/forensic.log"

OPTIONS
       -a     Append to FILE. Without this option, FILE is truncated after
              opening.

       -f FMT Define timestamp format. FMT is a strftime(3) format string,
              with an additional format conversion specifier %@, which is
              replaced with micronseconds.

              See also -w, below.

       -s     Add timestamp to the end of each line (suffix mode).

       -u     Report times in UTC.

       -w CHR Replace each occurrense of character CHR in format string with
              single whitespace. Use this option if your Apache version is
              unable to correctly process quoted arguments in the ForensicLog
              statement.  Example usage (newlines added for readability):

              ForensicLog "|/usr/bin/addts -w_ -f %Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S.%@:_ \
                            -a /var/log/httpd/forensic.log"

BUGS
       Formatted timestamp cannot be longer than 511 bytes.

       Empty lines are left unchanged (no timestamp added).

SEE ALSO
       strftime(3).
