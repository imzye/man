RFC(1)                  FreeBSD General Commands Manual                 RFC(1)

NAME
       rfc -   search rfc-index for specified RFC and list topic

SYNOPSIS
       rfc [ RFC-number ] [ -dhiklmnoprsuw  ]

DESCRIPTION
       RFC Is a utility that allows you to quickly find RFCs (Proposed or
       current Internet standards specifications).  It can be used to find
       which RFCs contain information relevent to your search and then
       optionally display, dump to file, or mail them.

OPTIONS
       rfc-number
              search rfc-index for the specified RFC and list its topic

       -d rfc-number [ /path/ ]
              Dumps plain text RFC. default is current dir

       -h     displays summarized help

       -i     Updates the $indexpath via the $viewer

       -k     Keyword; same as -s

       -l rfc-number
              Spawns $viewer to the specified RFC

       -m rfc-number user@remote.net [opt subject]
              Emails the RFC to given address

       -n port/daemon
              Local search for non-standard service/port nums (BO, Netbus,
              etc) This is essentially the same as a grep on /etc/services but
              with the additional info from NMAP's large known-ports database.
              This will have entries that INI's assigned numbers database will
              not.

       -o rfc-number
              Dumps RFC to STDOUT

       -p     Connect to INI's assigned numbers database for protocol numbers
              or services/ports association.  This is the standards based well
              known ports and protocols reference.  Very handy if you are
              setting up firewalls or looking at logged output.

       -r     Go wild with your own regexp on rfc-index

       -s string
              Search the index for specific string

       -u server-number
              Sets the base URL to the number listed with -w

       -w     Lists the available webservers to display

CONFIGURATION
       rfc will obey the $RFCVIEWER environment variable if it is set.  If
       undefined it will look in your $PATH for w3m and then lynx.  You can
       hard-code which one you want in the top portion of the script.

       Under the @URLS array you can now have a URl start with an ! to have it
       be treated as html rather than text.  Add as many URLs as you please.
       This is also where you would add your local repository of rfcs, like
       /home/user/rfcs/.

       In order to make this utility available to all system users the default
       $indexpath and $servpath is set to /usr/local/etc/.  If you do not have
       root abilities on this box then you can manually edit the script to
       specify an area that you do have permissions to write to.

EXAMPLES
        $ rfc -k mpls.*ldp
        The Result:
        3035 MPLS using LDP and ATM VC Switching. B. Davie, J.
             Lawrence, K. McCloghrie, E. Rosen, G. Swallow, Y.
             Rekhter, P. Doolan. January 2001. (Format:
             TXT=46463 bytes) (Status: US:) (Status: PROPOSED
             STANDARD)

        $ rfc -l 3035  would then use w3m or lynx to view the
                       discovered RFC

        $ rfc 822
        The Result:
        0822 Standard for the format of ARPA Internet text
             messages. D.  Crocker. Aug-13-1982. (Format:
             TXT=109200 bytes) (Obsoletes RFC0733) (Obsoleted
             by RFC2822) (Updated by RFC1123, RFC1138, RFC1148,
             RFC1327, RFC2156) (Also STD0011) (Status: US:)
             (Status: STANDARD)

        $ rfc -p ip 8
        Making connection to server....
        http://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers

            8  EGP  Exterior Gateway Protocol   [RFC888,DLM1]

            [RFC888] Seamonson, L., and E. Rosen, "STUB"
            Exterior Gateway Protocol", RFC 888, BBN
            Communications Corporation, January 1984.
            [DLM1] David Mills  <Mills@HUEY.UDEL.EDU>


        $ netstat -an
          [....]
          tcp   0  0 0.0.0.0:7100    0.0.0.0:*   LISTEN
          [....]
          We see port 7100 listening, what is it?

        $ rfc -n 7100
        Looking up service...
        font-service      7100/tcp   # X Font Service
        font-service      7100/udp   # X Font Service



FILES
       /usr/local/etc/rfc-index
              This is the default $indexpath with all of the RFC numbers and
              brief descriptions of content.  Installed with the rfc -i
              option.

       $HOME/.rfcrc
              Initialization file with your BaseURL for grabbing RFCs (set
              with -u)

       /usr/local/etc/nmap-services
              This is the default $servpath for the non-standard
              ports/services database from NMAP.  This is installed with the
              rfc -n -i option.

NOTES
       The default base URL is http://www.ietf.org/rfc/

       By default, the program will search your path for w3m or lynx and use
       the first one found as the viewer; if you want to change this, edit the
       source.

KNOWN ISSUES
       Some sites have leading 0's on RFCs < 1000, ie, RFC0822 may be
       rfc822.txt or rfc0822.txt.  I have yet to implement a feature to work
       around this.  Most of the sub 1k RFCs have newer counter parts.  Look
       for "obsoleted by" in the output from -k -s or -r to find the more up
       to date RFC.  The real bug is the non-standardized rfc distibution.
       IETF.org has them with leading zeros, so I'm sticking with that.


BUGS
       Let me know if you find any.  This is a work in progress but I'm really
       happy with how easy it's made my life.
