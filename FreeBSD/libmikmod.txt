NAME
       libmikmod-config - script to get information about the installed
       version of libmikmod.


SYNOPSIS
       libmikmod-config [--prefix[=DIR]] [--exec-prefix[=DIR]] [--version]
       [--libs] [--cflags] [--ldadd]


DESCRIPTION
       libmikmod-config is a tool that is used to determine the compiler and
       linker flags that should be used to compile and link programs that use
       libmikmod. It is also used internally by the libmikmod.m4 macro for GNU
       autoconf that is included with libmikmod.


OPTIONS
       libmikmod-config accepts the following options:

       --version
               Print the currently installed version of libmikmod on the
               standard output.

       --libs  Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a libmikmod
               program.

       --ldadd Print the extra linker flags that are necessary to link a
               libmikmod program if it was compiled with the GNU C compiler.

       --cflags
               Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a
               libmikmod program.

       --prefix=PREFIX
               If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix
               that libmikmod was built with when computing the output for the
               --cflags and --libs options. This option is also used for the
               exec prefix if --exec-prefix was not specified. This option
               must be specified before any --libs or --cflags options.

       --exec-prefix=PREFIX
               If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation exec
               prefix that libmikmod was built with when computing the output
               for the --cflags and --libs options.  This option must be
               specified before any --libs or --cflags options.
