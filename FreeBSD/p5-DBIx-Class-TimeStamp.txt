DBIx::Class::TimeStamp(3)                  User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       DBIx::Class::TimeStamp - DBIx::Class extension to update and create
       date and time based fields

DESCRIPTION
       Works in conjunction with InflateColumn::DateTime to automatically set
       update and create date and time based fields in a table.

SYNOPSIS
        package My::Schema;

        __PACKAGE__->load_components(qw( TimeStamp ... Core ));

        __PACKAGE__->add_columns(
           id => { data_type => 'integer' },
           t_created => { data_type => 'datetime', set_on_create => 1 },
           t_updated => { data_type => 'datetime',
               set_on_create => 1, set_on_update => 1 },
        );

       Now, any update or create actions will update the specified columns
       with the current time, using the DateTime inflator.

       This is effectively trigger emulation to get consistent behavior across
       databases that either implement them poorly or not at all.

METHODS
   get_timestamp
       Returns a DateTime object pointing to now.  Override this method if you
       have different time accounting functions, or want to do anything
       special.

       The date and time objects in the database are expected to be inflated.
       As such you can be pretty flexible with what you want to return here.
