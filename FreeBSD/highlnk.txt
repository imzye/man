NAME
       highlnk - High-Performance hardlinking tool

SYNOPSIS
       highlnk target_directory

DESCRIPTION
       HighLnk is a high-performance hardlinking tool, which takes the
       contents of the current directory, and hard-links files with different
       content to the target directory. Files with same content will also be
       hard-linked but in a way that storage space is saved.  This is useful
       if you have many files on a read-only partition, or if you plan to put
       many files on a CD/DVD, but the whole tree is just too big to fit on
       the media. HighLnk can help mkisofs(8) by supplying hard-links to same
       content, saving space on the media.

PARAMETERS
       target_directory
              This is the location where the resulting tree will be put. It
              MUST be on the same drive/partition as the current dir,
              otherwise it won't work.
