DESCRIPTION
       npadmin is a utility to request information from a network connected
       printer.

   PRINTERSPECS
       npadmin can accept any reasonable number of printer specification on
       the command line. A printer specification can be any one of the
       following:

       hostname
              The printer name or IP address e.g. scv-doc or 10.10.10.10

       network/subnetmask
              e.g. 10.10.10.0/255.255.255.0 or 10.10.10.0/24

       IP address range
              e.g. 10.10.10.10-20

              If you need to specify different community names for a different
              printerspecs then surround them with parenthesis
              171.68.205.0/24(private) otherwise the program will use whatever
              is specified by the -c option or the defualt community name of
              "public".


   OPERATIONAL OPTIONS
       These options affect the way that the program opperates. They can be
       used with any other options.

       -c community, --community community
              Specify the comunity name

       -t timeout, --timeout timeout
              Specify the amount of time to wait for a response before
              assuming that there is no respones.

       --debugsnmp
              Logs the snmp packets sent and received to a file called
              snmplog.xxx.

       --version
              Print out the version of npadmin and then stop.

       --help Print out some help information.

       --name This option puts either the name you supplied on the command
              line or the ip address of the device you are communicating with,
              in front of every line that that is printed out. This option
              gets turned on automatically when you have more than 2 printers
              specified on the command line. This is so that scripts can
              figure out whose data is whose.

   SINGLE LINE OPTIONS
       These options output a series of values on one line. They can be mixed
       freely.

       --vendor
              Print out the vendor that made the printer.  Returns: vendor

       --model
              Print out the model of the printer.  Returns: model

       --contact
              Print out the contact information for the printer. This includes
              both the contact person and the location of the printer.
              Returns: contact, location

       --netconfig
              Print out the network configuation of the printer.  Returns:
              ipaddr, hwaddr, gateway, netmask

       --printmib
              Print out whether this printer support the printer mib RFC 1759.
              Returns: printmib

       --hostmib
              Print out whether this printer support the host mib RFC 1514.
              Returns: hostmib

       --memory
              Print out the amount of memory the printer has installed in it.
              Returns: memsize

       --maxpapersize
              Print out the maximum paper size for the printer. -2 means that
              the printer does not know.  Returns: maxMediaUnit,
              maxMediaFeedDir, maxMediaXFeedDir

       --enginespeed
              Print out the engine speed for the printer.  Note: This number
              can be rather decieving, beware. Some vendors report it in
              sheets and others report it in impressions.  Impressions are the
              number of sides a printer prints whereas sheets are double sided
              sheets of paper. The tricky part with this is that engine speed
              is really based upon the rate at which paper is moved past the
              various componants. So if you are printing on a different size
              of paper than what the vendor was thinking of when they
              calculated this number, you will not get the same speed as they
              report. Also impressions can be rather decieving because to
              print both sides of a peice of paper, the printer has to have a
              short time where the marker mechanism is not in use. This leads
              to a slowdown which means that if you are printing duplex you
              will not be able to attain the maximum engine speed.  Probably
              the most honest measurement is also the least useful for
              comparison and that is something like inches per minute or
              meters per minute.  Returns: maxSpeedUnit, maxSpeed

       --duplex
              Print out whether this printer does duplex printing.  Returns:
              duplex

       --status
              Print out the status of the printer.  Returns: status

       --minpapersize
              Print out the minimum paper size for the printer. -2 means that
              the printer does not know.  Returns:
              minMediaUnit,minMediaFeedDir,minMediaXFeedDir

       --appletalk
              Print out whether the printer supports appletalk.  Returns:
              appletalk

       --lpd  Print out whether the printer supports lpd.  Returns: lpd

       --netware
              Print out whether the printer supports netware.  Note: This is
              keyed off of the netware print server channel type. There is
              also a netware printer channel type but I have yet to find a
              printer vendor that uses it.  Returns: netware

       --port9100
              Print out whether the printer supports port 9100 connections.
              Note: The people doing RFC 1759 depricated this channel type and
              replaced it with a new channel type which is called
              bidirectional TCP. The thing is that a printer might have a
              bidirectional TCP port that is not on port 9100 and it would set
              this flag to true. This option will return true if there is any
              one of three channel types are specified, AppSocket (for
              Tektronix on port 9100), port 9100, or bidirectional TCP.
              Returns port9100

       --pjl  Print out whether the printer supports pjl.  Returns: pjl

       --hpgl Print out whether the printer supports hpgl.  Returns: hpgl

       --autolang
              Print out whether the printer can do auto language detection.
              Note: Quite a few printer vendors don't have a row in the
              interpreter table to indicate this feature although they support
              it.  Returns: autolang

       --pcl  Print out whether the printer supports pcl.  Returns: pcl

       --postscript
              Print out whether the printer supports PostScript Returns:
              postscript

       --marker
              Print out the complete marker table.  Note: Even though this is
              truly a multiline option, I have never come across a printer
              with more than one marker in it, so this can probably be used as
              a single line option safely.  Returns: markerTechnology,
              counterUnits, lifeCount, processColorants, addessabiityUnit,
              addressabilityFeedDir, addressabilityXFeedDir, northMargin,
              southMargin, eastMargin, westMargin, status.

       --pagecount
              Print out the pagecount for each marker that a printer has. (I
              have never seen a printer that has more than one marker and so
              you can essentially use this as a single item.)  Returns:
              counterUnits, pagecount

       --colors
              Print out the number of process colorants that a printer has. (I
              thought this field would be more useful than it is. It basically
              states how many different colors of stuff (toner, wax, ink
              whatever) the marker uses to print its output.  Returns:
              processColorants

       --resolution
              Print out the resolution that the marker can address. -2 means
              that the printer doesn't know.  Returns: addressabilityUnit,
              addressabilityFeedDir, addressabilityXFeedDir

       --minmargin
              Print out the minimum distance from the edge of the paper that
              the printer is willing to print. -2 means the printer doesn't
              know.  Returns: addressabilityUnit, northMargin, southMargin,
              eastMargin, westMargin

       --cfgsrc
              Print out how the printer was configured.  Returns: cfgsrc Note:
              This currently only works on HP's.

   MULTILINE OPTIONS
       These options return tables that can potentially have multiple lines in
       them. These tables are expected to be parsed line by line. It is not
       reccomended that you mix these options with either single line options
       or with each other.

       --storage
              Print out the complete storage table for the printer.  Returns:
              desc, allocunits, size, used, allocfail

       --mediapath
              Print out the complete media path table for the printer.
              Returns: maxSpeedPrintUnit, mediaSizeUnit, maxSpeed,
              maxMediaFeedDir, maxMediaXFeedDir, minMediaFeedDir,
              minMediaXFeedDir, type, status

       --inputtray
              Print out the complete inputtray table. -2 means that the
              printer doesn't know. -3 means that there is enough paper in
              that try to print at least one more page.  Note: The accuracy
              with which they measure the amount of paper in the paper trays
              is not very good and the way they report back the amount of
              paper in a tray is rather suspect. On some printers a paper tray
              with some paper in it but not very much might report 0 for the
              current level and an error in the status rather than reporting
              -3 and an ok. Also they might report that a tray is completly
              full when there is much less paper in it.  Returns: type,
              dimUnit, dimFeedDir, dimXFeedDir, capUnit, maxCap, curLevel,
              status, mediaName, name, description

       --protocol
              Print out the channel table. This is basically all the ways that
              you can communicate with a printer. It includes not only the
              protocols but things like serial ports and IrDA ports.  Returns:
              type, version, currentJobControlLang, defaultPageDescLang,
              state, status

       --languages
              Print out the complete interpreter table.  Returns: langFamily,
              langLevel, langVersion, description, version, orientation,
              feedAddressability, xFeedAddressability, twoWay

       --supplies
              Print out the complete marker supplies table. -2 means the
              printer doesn't know. -3 means the printer has enough to print
              one more page.  Note: Unfortunately most printer vendors (even
              the ones that provide gas guages for their web based tools) do
              not fill in these objects very carefully.  Returns: class, type,
              desc, supplyunit, maxcap, level

       --alerts
              Print out the complete alert table.  Returns: severityLevel,
              trainingLevel, group, groupIndex, location, code, description,
              time

       --display
              Print out what is in the display of the printer.  Returns:
              displayBufferText

       --covers
              Print out the complete cover table.  Returns: description,
              status

       --reboot
              Reboots a printer.


   VARIABLE DESCRIPTIONS
       vendor A string that represents the company that made the device.

       model  The model as the printer reports it.  Note: This can sometimes
              be confusing because some printers don't report exactly what we
              think the model is. For example all HP 5si's return LaserJet 5si
              no matter if it is a plain 5si, a mopier or a 5si MX.

       contact
              The textual identification of the contact person for this
              managed node, together with information on how to contact this
              person.  If no contact information is known, the value is the
              zero-length string.

       location
              The physical location of this node (e.g., `telephone closet, 3rd
              floor'). If the location is unknown, the value is the zero-
              length string.

       ipaddr The IP address of the printer.

       hwaddr The ethernet address of that network card.

       gateway
              The default gateway of the printer.

       netmask
              The netmask for this printer's IP address.

       printmib
              Set to 'Y' if the printer supports the printer mib RFC 1759 and
              'N' if the printer doesn't.

       hostmib
              Set to 'Y' if the printer supports the host mib RFC 1514 and 'N'
              if it doesn't.

       memsize
              The number of K the printer has installed in it.

       desc   Used in several tables to indicate the description.

       allocunits
              The size, in bytes, of the data objects allocated from this
              pool.  If this entry is monitoring sectors, blocks, buffers, or
              packets, for example, this number will commonly be greater than
              one. Otherwise this number will typically be one.

       size   The size of the storage represented by this entry, in units of
              allocunits.

       used   The amount of the storage represented by this entry that is
              allocated, in units of allocunits.

       allocfail
              The number of requests for storage represented by this entry
              that could not be honored due to not enough storage.

       maxSpeedPrintUnit
              The unit of measure used in specifying the speed of all media
              paths in the printer. This can be any one of the following:
              tenThousandthsOfInchesPerHour(3), micrometersPerHour(4),
              charactersPerHour(5), linesPerHour(6), impressionsPerHour(7),

              micrometers(4)

       maxSpeed
              The maximum printing speed of this media path expressed in

       minMediaFeedDir
              The minimum physical media size in the feed direction of this
              media path expressed in units of measure specified by

              longEdgeBindingDuplex(3), shortEdgeBindingDuplex(4), simplex(5).

       status Status is used in a lot of tables and it has several independant
              parts.

              Availability: Available and Idle, Available and Standby,
              Available and Active, Available and Busy, Unavailable and
              OnRequest, Unavailable because Broken, Unknown.

              intended state

       duplex Is at least one of the media paths a duplex path.

       type (as it applies to inputtray)
              The type of technology (discriminated primarily according to
              feeder mechanism type) employed by the input sub-unit.  Note,
              the Optional Input Class provides for a descriptor field to
              further qualify the other choice. Can be any one of the
              following: other(1), unknown(2), sheetFeedAutoRemovableTray(3),
              sheetFeedAutoNonRemovableTray(4), sheetFeedManual(5),
              continuousRoll(6), continuousFanFold(7)

       dimUnit
              The unit of measurement for use calculating and relaying
              dimensional values for this input sub-unit. Can be either one of
              the following: tenThousandthsOfInches(3), micrometers(4)

       dimFeedDir
              This object provides the value of the declared dimension, in the
              feed direction, of the media that is (or, if empty, was or will
              be) in this input sub-unit.  The feed direction is the direction
              in which the media is fed on this sub-unit. This dimension is
              measured in input sub-unit dimensional units (dimUnit). The
              value (-1) means other and specifically means that this sub-unit
              places no restriction on this parameter. The value (-2)
              indicates unknown.

       dimXFeedDir
              This object provides the value of the declared dimension, in the
              cross feed direction, of the media that is (or, if empty, was or
              will be) in this input sub-unit.  The cross  feed direction is
              ninety degrees relative to the feed direction associated with
              this sub-unit. This dimension is measured in input sub-unit
              dimensional units (dimUnit). The value (-1) means other and
              specifically means that this sub-unit places no restriction on
              this parameter. The value (-2) indicates unknown.

       capUnit
              The unit of measurement for use in calculating and relaying
              capacity values for this input sub-unit. Can be any one of the
              following: tenThousandthsOfInches(3), micrometers(4), sheets(8),
              feet(16), meters(17)

       maxCap The maximum capacity of the input sub-unit in input sub-unit
              capacity units (CapacityUnit).  There is no convention
              associated with the media itself so this value reflects claimed
              capacity. The value (-1) means other and specifically indicates
              that the sub-unit places no restrictions on this parameter.  The
              value (-2) means unknown.

       curLevel
              The current capacity of the input sub-unit in input sub-unit
              capacity units (CapacityUnit). The value (-1) means other and
              specifically indicates that the sub-unit places no restrictions
              on this parameter. The value (-2) means unknown. The value (-3)
              means that the printer knows that at least one unit remains.

       mediaName
              A description of the media contained in this input sub-unit;
              This description is intended for display to a human operator.
              This description is not processed by the printer.  It is used to
              provide information not expressible in terms of the other media
              attributes (e.g. dimFeedDir, dimXFeedDir, type). An example
              would be `legal tender bond paper'.

              hundrethsOfFluidOunces(14), tenthsOfMilliliters(15), feet(16),
              meters(17)

       maxcap The maximum capacity of this supply container/receptacle
              expressed in prtMarkerSuppliesSupplyUnit. If this supply
              container/receptacle can reliably sense this value, the value is
              reported by the printer and is read-only; otherwise, the value
              may be written (by a Remote Control Panel or a Management
              Application). The value (-1) means other and specifically
              indicates that the sub-unit places no restrictions on this
              parameter. The value (-2) means unknown.

       level  The current level if this supply is a container; remaining space
              if this supply is a receptacle. If this supply
              container/receptacle can reliably sense this value, the value is
              reported by the printer and is read- only; otherwise, the value
              may be written (by a Remote Control Panel or a Management
              Application). The value (- 1) means other and specifically
              indicates that the sub- unit places no restrictions on this
              parameter. The value (-2) means unknown.  A value of (-3) means
              that the printer knows that there is some supply/remaining
              space, respectively.

       severityLevel
              The level of severity of this alert table entry. The printer
              determines the severity level assigned to each entry into the
              table. It can be any one of the following: other(1),
              criticalBinaryChangeEvent(3), warningUnaryChangeEvent(4),
              warningBinaryChangeEvent(5)

       trainingLevel
              The level of training required to handle this alert, if human
              intervention is required. The noInterventionRequired value
              should be used if the event does not require any human
              intervention. The training level is an enumeration that is
              determined and assigned by the printer manufacturer based on the
              information or the training required to handle this alert.  The
              printer will break alerts into these different training levels.
              It is the responsibility of the management application in the
              system to determine how a particular alert is handled and how
              and to whom that alert is routed.  This value can be any one of
              the following: other(1), unknown(2), untrained(3), trained(4),
              fieldService(5), management(6), noInterventionRequired(7)

              The following are the four training levels of alerts:

              FieldService: Alerts that typically require advanced training
              and technical knowledge of the printer and its sub-units. An
              example of a technical person would be a manufacturer's Field
              Service representative, or other person formally trained by the
              manufacturer or similar representative.

              Trained: Alerts that require an intermediate or moderate level
              of knowledge of the printer and its sub-units. A typical
              examples of alerts that a trained operator can handle is
              replacing toner cartridges.

              Untrained: Alerts that can be fixed without prior training
              either because the action to correct the alert is obvious or the
              printer can help the untrained person fix the problem. A typical
              example of such an alert is reloading paper trays and emptying
              output bins on a low end printer.

              Management: Alerts that have to do with overall operation of and
              configuration of the printer. Examples of management events are
              configuration change of sub-units.

       group  The type of sub-unit within the printer model that this alert is
              related. Input, output, and markers are examples of printer
              model groups, i.e., examples of types of sub-units. Wherever
              possible, these enumerations match the sub-identifier that
              identifies the relevant table in the printmib. It can be any one
              of the following: other(1), hostResourcesMIBStorageTable(3),
              hostResourcesMIBDeviceTable(4), generalPrinter(5), cover(6),
              localization(7), input(8), output(9), marker(10),
              markerSupplies(11), markerColorant(12), mediaPath(13),
              channel(14), interpreter(15), consoleDisplayBuffer(16),
              consoleLights(17), alert(18) Note: If also has the possibility
              of being a a value of 30 and greater and are for use in other
              MIBs that augment tables in the Printer MIB. Therefore, other
              MIBs may assign alert codes of 30 or higher to use the alert
              table from the Printer MIB without requiring revising and re-
              publishing this document.

       groupIndex
              An index of the row within the principle table in the group
              identified by prtAlertGroup that represents the sub-unit of the
              printer that caused this alert.  The combination of the
              prtAlertGroup and the prtAlertGroupIndex defines exactly which
              printer sub- unit caused the alert; for example, Input #3,
              Output #2, and Marker #1. Every object in this MIB is indexed
              with hrDeviceIndex and optionally, another index variable.  If
              this other index variable is present in the table that generated
              the alert, it will be used as the value for this object.
              Otherwise, this value shall be -1.

       location
              The sub-unit location that is defined by the printer
              manufacturer to further refine the location of this alert within
              the designated sub-unit.  The location is used in conjunction
              with the Group and GroupIndex values; for example, there is an
              alert in Input #2 at location number 7. The value (-2) indicates
              unknown.

       code   The code that describes the type of alert for this entry in the
              table. It can be any one of the following values: other(1),
              unknown(2), coverOpened(3), coverClosed(4), interlockOpened(5),
              interlockClosed(6), configurationChanged(7), jammed(8),

       description (as it applies to alerts)
              A description of this alert entry.  The description is provided
              by the printer to further elaborate on the enumerated alert or
              provide information in the case where the code is classified as
              'other' or 'unknown'.  The printer is required to return a
              description string but the string may be a null string.

       time   The value of sysUpTime at the time that this alert was
              generated.

       description (as it applies to cover)

       status (as it applies to cover)
              This can be any one of the following: other(1), coverOpen(3),
              coverClosed(4), interlockOpen(5), interlockClosed(6)

       cfgsrc This is how the printer obtained its IP address.

EXAMPLE
       Here is an example invocation to try to discover all the printers on a
       small network.

          npadmin --model --timeout 6 144.254.42.0/24 2>/tmp/errorlog

          When this is done, you might want to check errrorlog for anything
          interesting like printers that npadmin doesn't recognise.

BUGS
       Very numerous. This program is still under development. Any place the
       program asserts out should be considered a bug and reported to the
       developers at ( ben@valinux.com )

       The code that parses multiple printers specifications into printer
       names is pretty green. It probably can be broken easily. Please come up
       with new and interesting ways to break and send them to ben@valinux.com
       and I will try to come up with ways to insulate npadmin from your
       mischeiviousness.

       This program has only been tested extensivly on Linux. If you do a port
       to another OS. Please email me.

       Many printer types are not supported yet. If you have a printer that is
       not supported. Please email the output of the command "snmpwalk
       printername public .1" to me.
