UUIDGEN(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             UUIDGEN(1)



NAME
       uuidgen - command-line utility to create a new UUID value

SYNOPSIS
       uuidgen [ -r | -t ]

DESCRIPTION
       The uuidgen program creates (and prints) a new universally unique
       identifier (UUID) using the libuuid(3) library.  The new UUID can
       reasonably be considered unique among all UUIDs created on the local
       system, and among UUIDs created on other systems in the past and in the
       future.

       There are two types of UUID's which uuidgen can generate: time-based
       UUID's and random-based UUID's.  By default uuidgen will generate a
       random-based UUID if a high-quality random number generator is present.
       Otherwise, it will chose a time-based UUID.  It is possible to force
       the generation of one of these two UUID types by using the -r or -t
       options.

OPTIONS
       -r     Generate a random-based UUID.  This method creates a UUID
              consisting mostly of random bits.  It requires that the
              operating system have a high quality random number generator,
              such as /dev/random.

       -t     Generate a time-based UUID.  This method creates a UUID based on
              the system clock plus the system's ethernet hardware address, if
              present.
