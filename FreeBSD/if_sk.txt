NAME
     sk – SysKonnect SK-984x and SK-982x PCI Gigabit Ethernet adapter driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device miibus
           device sk

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_sk_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The sk driver provides support for the SysKonnect SK-984x and SK-982x
     series PCI Gigabit Ethernet adapters.

     The SysKonnect adapters consist of two main components: the XaQti Corp.
     XMAC II gigabit MAC and the SysKonnect GEnesis controller ASIC.  The XMAC
     provides the gigabit MAC and PHY support while the GEnesis provides an
     interface to the PCI bus, DMA support, packet buffering and arbitration.
     The GEnesis can control up to two XMACs simultaneously, allowing dual-
     port NIC configurations.

     The SK-982x 1000baseT adapters also include a Broadcom BCM5400 1000baseTX
     PHY which is used in place of the XMAC's internal PHY.  The Broadcom PHY
     is connected to the XMAC via its GMII port.

     The sk driver configures dual port SysKonnect adapters such that each
     XMAC is treated as a separate logical network interface.  Both ports can
     operate independently of each other and can be connected to separate
     networks.  The SysKonnect driver software currently only uses the second
     port on dual port adapters for failover purposes: if the link on the
     primary port fails, the SysKonnect driver will automatically switch
     traffic onto the second port.

     Also supported is the Marvell Semiconductor 88E100* gigabit PHY.

     The XaQti XMAC II supports full and half duplex operation with
     autonegotiation.  The XMAC also supports unlimited frame sizes.  Support
     for jumbo frames is provided via the interface MTU setting.  Selecting an
     MTU larger than 1500 bytes with the ifconfig(8) utility configures the
     adapter to receive and transmit jumbo frames.  Using jumbo frames can
     greatly improve performance for certain tasks, such as file transfers and
     data streaming.

     The sk driver supports the following media types:

     autoselect            Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
                           The user can manually override the autoselected
                           mode by adding media options to the /etc/rc.conf
                           file.

     1000baseTX            Set 1000baseTX operation over twisted pair.  This
                           is only available for SK-982x series adapters with
                           1000baseT ports.  Both full-duplex and half-duplex
                           modes are supported.

     1000baseSX            Set 1000Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) operation.  Both
                           full-duplex and half-duplex modes are supported.

     The sk driver supports the following media options:

     full-duplex           Force full duplex operation.

     half-duplex           Force half duplex operation.

     For more information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

HARDWARE
     Adapters supported by the sk driver include:

     •   Linksys (revision 2) single port, 1000baseT adapter
     •   SK-9521 SK-NET GE-T single port, 1000baseT adapter
     •   SK-9821 SK-NET GE-T single port, 1000baseT adapter
     •   SK-9822 SK-NET GE-T dual port, 1000baseT adapter
     •   SK-9841 SK-NET GE-LX single port, single mode fiber adapter
     •   SK-9842 SK-NET GE-LX dual port, single mode fiber adapter

     •   SK-9844 SK-NET GE-SX dual port, multimode fiber adapter
     •   SMC 9452TX single port, 1000baseT adapter

LOADER TUNABLES
     Tunables can be set at the loader(8) prompt before booting the kernel or
     stored in loader.conf(5).

     hw.skc.jumbo_disable
             Disable jumbo frame support.  Systems with less memory can set it
             to a non-zero value to save memory.  The default value is 0.

SYSCTL VARIABLES
     The following variable is available as both sysctl(8) variable and
     loader(8) tunable:

     dev.skc.%d.int_mod
             This variable controls interrupt moderation.  The accepted range
             is 10 to 10000.  The default value is 100 microseconds.  The
             interface has to be brought down and up again before a change
             takes effect.

DIAGNOSTICS
     sk%d: couldn't map memory  A fatal initialization error has occurred.

     sk%d: couldn't map ports  A fatal initialization error has occurred.

     sk%d: couldn't map interrupt  A fatal initialization error has occurred.

     sk%d: no memory for softc struct!  The driver failed to allocate memory
     for per-device instance information during initialization.

     sk%d: failed to enable memory mapping!  The driver failed to initialize
     PCI shared memory mapping.  This might happen if the card is not in a
     bus-master slot.

     sk%d: no memory for jumbo buffers!  The driver failed to allocate memory
     for jumbo frames during initialization.

     sk%d: watchdog timeout  The device has stopped responding to the network,
     or there is a problem with the network connection (cable).
