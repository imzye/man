List::Util::WeightedRoundRobin(3)          User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       List::Util::WeightedRoundRobin - Creates a list based on weighted input

SYNOPSIS
         my $list = [
           {
               name    => 'jingle',
               weight  => 6,
           },
           {
               name    => 'bells',
               weight  => 2,
           },
         ];

         my $WeightedList = List::Util::WeightedRoundRobin->new();
         my $weighted_list = $WeightedList->create_weighted_list( $list );

DESCRIPTION
       "List::Util::WeightedRoundRobin" is a utility for creating a weighted
       list based on the input and associated weights.

METHOD
   new
       Constructs a new "List::Util::WeightedRoundRobin" and returns it. Takes
       no arguments.

   create_weighted_list
       Takes an array reference as an argument. The array reference must
       contain hash entries which have a 'name' and 'weight' key.

       If the sources are valid and a weighted list has been created, the
       method will return a weighted list. In the case of an error, the
       returned list will be empty.
