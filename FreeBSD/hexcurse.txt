NAME
       hexcurse - an ncurses-based hex editor

SYNOPSIS
       hexcurse [ -? | -help ] [ -a ] [ -c colorlevel ] [ -e ] [ -f ] [ -o
       outputfile ] [ -r rnum ] [ -t ] [ [ -i ] inputfile ]

DESCRIPTION
       hexcurse is an ncurses-based hexeditor utility that is able to open,
       modify, and save a file to disk while providing useful editing and
       searching options.

OPTIONS
       -?  |  -help   Prints out the command usage info

       -a             Specifies the addresses to be output in decimal format
                      initially.

       -c_colorlevel  Specifies the color level.
                         0: no colors
                         1: only color for addresses
                         2: 1 + color for 00 (default if terminal supports
                         color)
                         3: multicolor by FrankSansC

       -e             Specifies the characters to be output in EBCDIC format
                      rather than ASCII.

       -f             Specifies that function key numbers will be shown along
                      names in the labels.

       -o_outputfile  Specifies the output file to be written to by default.

       -r_rnum        Specifies the number of characters per line that the
                      hexeditor should output.  If rnum is either less than 1
                      or greater than the columns of the current terminal,
                      hexcurse will fill the terminal width, just as if the -r
                      was not specified.

       -t             Specifies the colors set by the terminal should be kept
                      (all background and normal foreground). Set this if you
                      see ugly colors or don't see some colors at all.

       [ -i ]_inputfile
                      Specifies the input file to be read in.  -i is not
                      needed if inputfile is the last argument on the line.

INTERACTIVE OPTIONS
       F1 | ctrl+?    Shows key command help.

       F2 | ctrl+s    Save the current file.

       F3 | ctrl+o    Opens a file.

       F4 | ctrl+g    Goto a certain location in the current file.  Depending
                      on which way the addresses are being viewed at the
                      moment, the search will behave differently.  If the
                      addresses are currently in hex format, the search will
                      search as if the input was given in hexadecimal format.
                      If the addresses are in decimal format, the function
                      will search for the address in decimal.

       F5 | ctrl+f    Search for a certain string in the current file starting
                      at the next position to the cursor.  Depending on which
                      window the user is currently editing in, this search
                      will behave differently.  If editing in the hex window,
                      the input should only be in hexadecimal, and it will
                      search for the hexadecimal "string".  If the current
                      editing window is the ASCII window, the input should be
                      ASCII characters, and the search will find that ASCII
                      string in the file.  The search string is limited to 80
                      bytes.

       F6 | ctrl+a    Switch between hexadecimal address values and decimal
                      address values.

       F7 | TAB       Switch between the hexadecimal and ASCII editing
                      windows.

       F8 | ctrl+q | ctrl+x
                      Exit out of the program.

       Page Up | ctrl+u
                      Scroll one 'page' up.

       Page Down | ctrl+d
                      Scroll one 'page' down.

       Home | ctrl+t  Returns to the top of the file.

       End | ctrl+b   Jumps to the bottom of the file.

       ctrl+z         Undo the last modification.  Can be used multiple times.

       Esc            Escapes out of the save, open, goto, and find prompts.

BUGS
       On some terminals the function keys will not work.

       Support for resizable terminals is still a bit rudimentary.  At this
       time, when the terminal is resized, the cursor is positioned at the
       beginning of the file.  This will be corrected in the next release.
       There is also an issue where the labels on the bottom of the screen do
       not resize correctly.  A fix for the latter is in the works.

TODO
       When we get the time, we would like to implement the ability to insert
       and delete data from the file.  Please send any additional suggestions.
