       -c <color>
        Run with a colormap based on a given color

                      -c 0xaaccff for shades of something?!


EXAMPLES
       xglurbules -x 640 -y 512 -n 20000 -f -c 0xfce3f6

       Run xglurbules 640 pixels wide, 512 pixels high with 20000 particles
       while showing the number of frames per second, all in a sort of vile
       barney purple type colour.

       xglurbules -x 800 -y 50 -n 1000
               A narrow horizontal burny bouncy thing

       xglurbules -x 128 -y 1024 -n 2000
               Column of bouncy fire

       xglurbule-noshm
               Don't use shared memory (probably MUCH slower)

       pkg_deinstall xglurbules
               I don't like it, deinstall it now!

BUGS
       Many, including :

       1) At non-square aspect ratios particles move oddly due to a particle
       system that's kludged on a 1 by 1 floating point square.

       2) There's no non-floating point particle system

       3) no support for -geometry

       4) There is no fourth bug.

       5) -r uses the top left corner of the root window. D'Oh!

       6) -r doens't take keystrokes in the root window

       7..N) Not sure, but they're probably there.
