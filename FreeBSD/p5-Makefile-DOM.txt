NAME
       MDOM::Dumper - Dumping of MDOM trees

SYNOPSIS
         # Load a document
         my $Module = MDOM::Document->new( 'MyMakefile' );

         # Create the dumper
         my $Dumper = MDOM::Dumper->new( $Module );

         # Dump the document
         $Dumper->print;

DESCRIPTION
       The MDOM trees in MDOM are quite complex, and getting a dump of their
       structure for development and debugging purposes is important.

       This module provides that functionality.

       The process is relatively simple. Create a dumper object with a
       particular set of options, and then call one of the dump methods to
       generate the dump content itself.

METHODS
   new $Element, param => value, ...
       The "new" constructor creates a dumper, and takes as argument a single
       MDOM::Element object of any type to serve as the root of the tree to be
       dumped, and a number of key->value parameters to control the output
       format of the Dumper. Details of the parameters are listed below.

       Returns a new "MDOM::Dumper" object, or "undef" if the constructor is
       not passed a correct MDOM::Element root object.

       memaddr
           Should the dumper print the memory addresses of each MDOM element.
           True/false value, off by default.

       indent
           Should the structures being dumped be indented. This value is
           numeric, with the number representing the number of spaces to use
           when indenting the dumper output. Set to '2' by default.

       class
           Should the dumper print the full class for each element.
           True/false value, on by default.

       content
           Should the dumper show the content of each element. True/false
           value, on by default.

       whitespace
           Should the dumper show whitespace tokens. By not showing the
           copious numbers of whitespace tokens the structure of the code can
           often be made much clearer. True/false value, on by default.

       comments
           Should the dumper show comment tokens. In situations where you have
           a lot of comments, the code can often be made clearer by ignoring
           comment tokens. True/value value, on by default.

       locations
           Should the dumper show the location of each token. The values shown
           are [ line, rowchar, column ]. See "location" in MDOM::Element for
           a description of what these values really are. True/false value,
           off by default.

   print
       The "print" method generates the dump and prints it to STDOUT.

       Returns as for the internal print function.

   string
       The "string" method generates the dump and provides it as a single
       string.

       Returns a string or undef if there is an error while generating the
       dump.

   list
       The "list" method generates the dump and provides it as a raw list,
       without trailing newlines.

       Returns a list or the null list if there is an error while generation
       the dump.

SUPPORT
