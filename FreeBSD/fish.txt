NAME
       _ - call fish's translations

SYNOPSIS
       _ STRING


DESCRIPTION
       _ translates its arguments into the current language, if possible.

       It is equivalent to gettext fish STRING, meaning it can only be used to
       look up fish's own translations.

       It requires fish to be built with gettext support. If that support is
       disabled, or there is no translation it will simply echo the argument
       back.

       The language depends on the current locale, set with LANG and
       LC_MESSAGES.

OPTIONS
       _ takes no options.
