NAME
       Finch - A Pimpin' Penguin console frontend to libpurple. Instant
       Messaging client.

SYNOPSIS
       finch [options]


DESCRIPTION
       finch is a console-based modular messaging client based on libpurple
       which is capable of connecting to XMPP, IRC, SILC, Novell GroupWise,
       Lotus Sametime, Zephyr, Gadu-Gadu, and QQ all at once. It has many
       common features found in other clients, as well as many unique
       features.


OPTIONS
       The following options are provided by finch using the standard GNU
       command line syntax:

       -c, --config=DIR
              Use DIR as the directory for config files instead of ~/.purple.

       -d, --debug
              Print debugging messages to stderr and start with the Debug
              window. The messages shown in the Debug window are the same as
              the ones printed in stderr.

       -h, --help
              Print this help and exit.

       -n, --nologin
              Don't automatically login when finch starts.  Sets all accounts
              to Offline.

       -v, --version
              Display the version information window.

              separated titles are placed into this workspace. These are
              matched as substrings. Window titles take precedence over names.
              window-titles = Preferences;Pounce

              #abc = bcd

              # Hitting 'space' will activate a button
              [GntButton::remap]
              \  = \r


Widget Actions
       You can specify key-bindings for specific widgets. The following
       entries in ~/.gntrc correspond to the default keybindings for the
       actions:

       [GntBox::binding]
       tab = focus-next
       right = focus-next
       left = focus-prev

       [GntComboBox::binding]
       down = dropdown
       up = dropdown

       [GntEntry::binding]
       c-a = cursor-home
       home = cursor-home
       c-e = cursor-end
       end = cursor-end
       backspace = delete-prev
       del = delete-next
       c-d = delete-next
       c-u = delete-start
       c-k = delete-end
       c-b = cursor-prev
       left = cursor-prev
       c-f = cursor-next
       right = cursor-next
       tab = suggest-show
       down = suggest-next
       up = suggest-prev
       page-down = suggest-next-page
       page-up = suggest-prev-page
       c-w = delete-prev-word
       a-b = cursor-prev-word
       a-f = cursor-next-word
       a-d = delete-next-word
       c-v = clipboard-paste
       c-p = history-prev
       c-n = history-next
       c-r = history-search
       c-up = history-prev
       c-down = history-next

       [GntTree::binding]
       up = move-up
       down = move-down
       c-n = move-down
       c-p = move-up
       pageup = page-up
       pagedown = page-down
       backspace = move-parent
       home = move-first
       end = move-last
       # Following is the default binding for the context-menu
       menu = context-menu
       # The following will let you open the context-menu in the buddylist
       with c-b
       # c-b = context-menu

       [GntWidget::binding]
       f11 = context-menu
       c-x = context-menu

       [GntWindow::binding]
       c-o = show-menu
       f10 = show-menu

       The c- corresponds to the Control key. You can also use ctrl- or ctr-
       or ctl- to indicate a combination. For alt-keys, you can use one of a-,
       alt-, m- or meta-. You can also use home, end, left, right etc. keys.

       To unbind a key which has a default binding, you simply bind it to the
       empty string.  For example, to unbind Alt + q from the Quit function,
       you would use:

       [GntWM::binding]
       a-q =


Menus
       You can also specify key-bindings to trigger specific menuitems in
       windows. For example, the following entry in ~/.gntrc will bind Ctrl +
       t to the 'Send IM...' item in the buddylist:

       [buddylist::menu]
       c-t = send-im

       The following is the list of IDs of the current menuitems in the
       buddylist:

       send-im
       join-chat
       show-empty-groups
       show-offline-buddies
       sort-status
       sort-alpha
       sort-log
       add-buddy
       add-chat
       add-group


Mouse Support
       There is experimental mouse support. You can focus windows, activate
       buttons, select rows in a list, scroll using the wheel-scroll etc.
       Selecting text in a text-view copies it to the gnt clipboard. Mouse
       support is disabled by default, so you need to enable it in ~/.gntrc
       (see the sample above).


Window Management
       The default window management is very limited. But it is possible to
       write custom window managers to suit your needs. There is a sample
       window-manager included (named s.so) which adds a little 'close-button'
       for the windows, removes the borders from the buddylist and pops up new
       windows in the middle of the screen, instead of at the upper-left
       corder. It is provided as a sample simple manager, but it should be
       possible to write more complex managers, and it's very possible that
       the window-manager API will need to be enhanced. Look at the sample
       ~/.gntrc file above to see how to select a window-manager.

       It is also possible to rebind the window-manager actions in ~/.gntrc,
       eg:

       [GntWM::binding]
       a-n = window-next
       a-p = window-prev
       a-c = window-close
       a-w = window-list
       a-d = dump-screen
       a-, = shift-left
       a-. = shift-right
       a-a = action-list
       a-m = start-move
       a-r = start-resize
       a-q = wm-quit
       a-l = refresh-screen
       a-s = workspace-list
       a-t = window-tag
       a-T = place-tagged
       a-C = toggle-clipboard
       a-/ = help-for-widget
       a-c-j = window-scroll-down
       a-c-k = window-scroll-up
       # The following action is still incomplete, and doesn't have a default
       binding
       # switch-window-n
       # Other actions: window-next-urgent, window-prev-urgent

       # For the sample custom window manager
       [GntS::binding]
       a-b = toggle-buddylist

       # For the irssi window manager
       [Irssi::binding]
       a-L = move-right
       a-H = move-left
       a-J = move-down
       a-K = move-up


Conversation Commands
       There are a few helpful commands in addition to the regular commands.
       You can use these from any conversation to access other windows.


       accounts
              for the accounts window.


       buddylist
              for the buddylist.


       debugwin
              for the debug window.


       plugins
              for the plugins window.


       prefs  for the preferences window.


       status for the status window.
