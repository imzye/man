EBSNVME-ID(8)           FreeBSD System Manager's Manual          EBSNVME-ID(8)

NAME
     ebsnvme-id – NVMe disk identification tool for Amazon EC2

SYNOPSYS
     ebsnvme-id [-b] [-m] [-s] [-u] [-v] ⟨device⟩

DESCRIPTION
     The Amazon EC2 “Nitro” platform exposes disks to virtual machines via the
     NVM Express protocol.  There are two types of disks so exposed: Elastic
     Block Store disks, which persist and can be detached and reattached to
     different virtual machines, and Instance Store disks (also known as
     “Ephemeral” disks), which exist only while the virual machine is running.

     Amazon Linux provides a tool “ebsnvme-id” for identifying the attached
     Elastic Block Store disks; this ebsnvme-id is a re-implementation which
     also exposes some information about Instance Store disks.

     The options are as follows:

     -b      Print the “Linux device name” associated with the specified
             Elastic Block Store disk.

     -m      Print the Model Number of the disk; this is either “Amazon
             Elastic Block Store” or “Amazon EC2 NVMe Instance Storage”
             depending on the type of disk.

     -s      Print the Serial Number of the disk.

     -u      Identical to the -b option.

     -v      Print “Volume ID:” followed by the volume ID of the Elastic Block
             Store disk.

     If no options are specified, ebsnvme-id operates as if invoked with the
     options -v -b.

     If multiple option are specified, output is printed for each option, in
     the order -v [-b | -u] -m -s.
