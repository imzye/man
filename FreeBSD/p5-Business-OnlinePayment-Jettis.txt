DESCRIPTION
       For detailed information see Business::OnlinePayment.

NOTE
       This module only implements 'CHECK' (ACH) functionality at this time.
       Credit card transactions are not (yet) supported.

COMPATIBILITY
       This module implements an interface to Jettis.com's HTTPS API.
       Unfortunately, no documentation is publicly available.  Jettis won't
       even send their full manual to their customers - they insist on sending
       only few-page snippets at a time.
