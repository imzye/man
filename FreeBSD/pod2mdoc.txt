POD2MDOC(1)             FreeBSD General Commands Manual            POD2MDOC(1)

NAME
     pod2mdoc – Convert POD data to mdoc input

SYNOPSIS
     pod2man [-chloqruv] [-d date] [-n title] [-s section] [file]

DESCRIPTION
     The pod2mdoc utility reads file and generates mdoc(7) input from
     perlpod(1) source.  If unspecified or -, file is taken to be standard
     input.  Its arguments are as follows:

     -chloqruv
             For compatibility with pod2man(1).  Ignored.

     -d date
             Set the document date (‘Dd’) to date (preferrably in "Month Day,
             Year" format).  If unspecified or if date is the literal string
             Mdocdate, pod2mdoc uses the file modification date or the current
             date if reading from standard input.  If date is the literal
             string Mdocdate, pod2mdoc prepends "$Mdocdate:" to the date and
             appends a dollar sign, producing the format used by OpenBSD
             cvs(1).

     -n title
             Set the document title (‘Dt’) to title.  If unspecified, pod2mdoc
             uses the suffix-stripped filename part of file as a document
             title or STDIN if reading from standard input (you probably don't
             want that).

     -s section
             Set the document section (‘Dt’) to section.  If unspecified,
             pod2mdoc uses 1 or, if the input file suffix is .pm, uses 3p.

   Smarts
     Since mdoc(7) is semantic and perlpod(1) is not, pod2mdoc tries to figure
     out semantic context for some terms.  Specifically, within each paragraph
     of the SYNOPSIS section, the following occur:

     •   If any number of #include <foo.h> lines are found at the start of a
         verbatim paragraph, they're rendered with ‘In’.

     •   Other lines starting with ‘#’ are rendered with ‘Fd’.

     •   Function declarations are rendered with ‘Ft’, ‘Fo’, and ‘Fa’.

     •   An initial B<> format code is rendered as ‘Nm’.

     •   Subsequent B<> format codes are rendered as ‘Ar’.  However, if the
         leading character of a B<> format code is ‘-’, it is rendered as
         ‘Fl’.  Subsequent space-separated terms without leading hyphens,
         e.g., B<-foo bar>, are rendered as ‘Ar’.

     •   Matching [ and ] pairs are rendered as ‘Oo’ and ‘Oc’.

     Thus, the input B<foo> [B<-bar baz>] is rendered as follows:

     .Nm foo
     .Oo
     .Fl bar Ar baz
     .Oc

     In the NAME section, ‘Nm’ and ‘Nd’ macros are inferred from text leading
     and trailing the last hyphen followed by a space (there may be any number
     of hyphens preceding the space).  The space may occur on either side of
     the hyphen.  Thus, B<foo> - bar will be rendered as follows:

     .Nm foo
     .Nd bar

     Multiple names separated by a comma are properly handled.

     In any section, the L<> format code is considered a ‘Lk’ link if
     beginning with http:, https:, ftp:, sftp:, smb:, or afs:.  If beginning
     with mailto:, it is considered a ‘Mt’ link.  Otherwise, it is considered
     a ‘Xr’ manpage in section 3P if containing double-colons or section 1
     otherwise.  The section may be overriden as L<foo(5)>.  If only a section
     appears, such as in </section>, the link is rendered with ‘Sx’.

     Words followed by "()" that match function names listed in the SYNOPSIS
     section are marked up with ‘Fn’.  If they don't match, they are marked up
     with ‘Xr’.  Words not followed by "()" that match preprocessor macros
     #define'd in the SYNOPSIS section are marked up with ‘Dv’.

     If the contents of a B<> or I<> format code matches a type name mentioned
     in the SYNOPSIS section, it is rendered as ‘Vt’.  If it matches a
     function argument name mentioned there, it is rendered as ‘Fa’.

EXIT STATUS
     The pod2mdoc utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     To pipe a POD document foo.pod through mandoc(1) and a pager:

           % pod2mdoc foo.pod | mandoc | more

COMPATIBILITY
     If -s is not specified and the suffix for file is .pm, pod2mdoc infers a
     manual section of 3p, not 3 as stipulated in perlpod(1).  Furthermore,
     all links in the format of L<Foo::Bar> are assumed to be in section 3p.

     If pod2mdoc encounters an =item without the necessary =over, it will
     pretend that a prior =over was invoked.  However, it will do so silently
     and not, as pod2man(1) does, append a POD ERRORS section in the output
     manpage saying so.

CAVEATS
     By way of being a presentational language, POD is not well-represented by
     mdoc(7).  Semantic content must be inferred and may be wrong.

     pod2mdoc only supports the named E<xxx> escapes.  HTML names and numbers
     are silently discarded.

     Although most white-space requests in character encodings are properly
     carried to output, adjacent character escapes with the specific
     whitespace sequence "B<2>B< 3>" will cause the second space to be lost.

     The S<> escape is discarded.

     Unless solely a section link, the text and section parts of
     L<text|link/section> are discarded.
