BGS(1)                  FreeBSD General Commands Manual                 BGS(1)

NAME
       bgs - background setter

SYNOPSIS
       bgs [-v] [-c] [-C hex] [-z] [-R] [-x] [IMAGE1...IMAGEN]

DESCRIPTION
       bgs allows you to tailor the appearance of the background ("root")
       window on a workstation display running X.

       bgs uses imlib2 for image rendering and rotates the images
       automatically. It is designed for dynamic Xinerama/Xrandr setups such
       as those used with notebooks, but it works well in any setup.

OPTIONS
       -v     prints version information to standard output, then exits.

       -c     centers image rather than scaling it.

       -C hex specifies background color to use when the image does not fill
              the screen.

       -z     zooms image rather than scaling it.

       -R     prevents automatic rotation for optimal screen fill.

       -x     switches to dynamic mode. bgs will update your background as
              soon as the root window changes.

       if multiple images are specified, each image is set for each monitor,
       in order.

SEE ALSO
       dwm(1) xsetroot(1)

BUGS
       bgs can't decide how the monitor is rotated if you use xrandr-rotation,
       so it assumes the monitor is rotated clockwise.
