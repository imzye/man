CRONTAB(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             CRONTAB(1)

NAME
       crontab - maintain crontab files for individual users (ISC Cron V4.1)

SYNOPSIS
       crontab [-u user] file
       crontab [-u user] [-l | -r | -e]

DESCRIPTION
       Crontab is the program used to install, deinstall or list the tables
       used to drive the cron(8) daemon in ISC Cron.  Each user can have their
       own crontab, and though these are files in /var, they are not intended
       to be edited directly.

       If the cron.allow file exists, then you must be listed therein in order
       to be allowed to use this command.  If the cron.allow file does not
       exist but the cron.deny file does exist, then you must not be listed in
       the cron.deny file in order to use this command.  If neither of these
       files exists, only the super user will be allowed to use this command.

       If the -u option is given, it specifies the name of the user whose
       crontab is to be tweaked.  If this option is not given, crontab
       examines "your" crontab, i.e., the crontab of the person executing the
       command.  Note that su(8) can confuse crontab and that if you are
       running inside of su(8) you should always use the -u option for
       safety's sake.

       The first form of this command is used to install a new crontab from
       some named file or standard input if the pseudo-filename ``-'' is
       given.

       The -l option causes the current crontab to be displayed on standard
       output.

       The -r option causes the current crontab to be removed.

       The -e option is used to edit the current crontab using the editor
       specified by the VISUAL or EDITOR environment variables.  After you
       exit from the editor, the modified crontab will be installed
       automatically.

FILES
       /var/cron/cron.allow
       /var/cron/cron.deny

STANDARDS
       The crontab command conforms to IEEE Std1003.2-1992 (``POSIX'').  This
       new command syntax differs from previous versions of Vixie Cron, as
       well as from the classic SVR3 syntax.

DIAGNOSTICS
       A fairly informative usage message appears if you run it with a bad
       command line.
