ROSENPASS(1)            FreeBSD General Commands Manual           ROSENPASS(1)

NAME
     rosenpass – builds post-quantum-secure VPNs

SYNOPSIS
     rosenpass [COMMAND] [OPTIONS ...] [ARGS ...]

DESCRIPTION
     rosenpass performs cryptographic key exchanges that are secure against
     quantum-computers and then outputs the keys.  These keys can then be
     passed to various services, such as wireguard or other vpn services, as
     pre-shared-keys to achieve security against attackers with quantum
     computers.

     This is a research project and quantum computers are not thought to
     become practical in fewer than ten years.  If you are not specifically
     tasked with developing post-quantum secure systems, you probably do not
     need this tool.

   COMMANDS
     keygen private-key <file-path> public-key <file-path>
             Generate a keypair to use in the exchange command later.  Send
             the public-key file to your communication partner and keep the
             private-key file secret!

     exchange private-key <file-path> public-key <file-path> [OPTIONS] PEERS
             Start a process to exchange keys with the specified peers.  You
             should specify at least one peer.

             Its OPTIONS are as follows:

             listen <ip>[:<port>]
                     Instructs rosenpass to listen on the specified interface
                     and port.  By default, rosenpass will listen on all
                     interfaces and select a random port.

             verbose
                     Extra logging.

   PEER
     Each PEER is defined as follows: "peer public-key <file-path> [endpoint
     <ip>[:<port>]] [preshared-key <file-path>] [outfile <file-path>]
     [wireguard <dev> <peer> <extra_params>]"

     Providing a PEER instructs rosenpass to exchange keys with the given peer
     and write the resulting PSK into the given output file.  You must either
     specify the outfile or wireguard output option.

     The parameters of PEER are as follows:

     endpoint <ip>[:<port>]
             Specifies the address where the peer can be reached.  This will
             be automatically updated after the first successful key exchange
             with the peer.  If this is unspecified, the peer must initiate
             the connection.

     preshared-key <file-path>
             You may specify a pre-shared key which will be mixed into the
             final secret.

     outfile <file-path>
             You may specify a file to write the exchanged keys to.  If this
             option is specified, rosenpass will write a notification to
             standard out every time the key is updated.

     wireguard <dev> <peer> <extra_params>
             This allows you to directly specify a wireguard peer to deploy
             the pre-shared-key to.  You may specify extra parameters you
             would pass to "wg set" besides the preshared-key parameter which
             is used by rosenpass.  This makes it possible to add peers
             entirely from rosenpass.

EXIT STATUS
     The rosenpass utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
