NAME
     rfcomm_sppd – RFCOMM Serial Port Profile daemon

SYNOPSIS
     rfcomm_sppd [-bhtS] -a address -c channel

DESCRIPTION
     The rfcomm_sppd utility is a Serial Port Profile daemon.  It can operate
     in two modes: client and server.

     In client mode, rfcomm_sppd opens RFCOMM connection to the specified
     address server and channel.  Once connection is established, the
     rfcomm_sppd utility provides access to the server's remote serial port
     via stdin/stdout or via pts(4) interface if -t option was specified.

     If the -S option is specified, rfcomm_sppd will operate in server mode
     and act as RFCOMM server, listening on ANY address and advertising a
     virtual serial port via the sdpd(8) daemon.  If -t options was specified,
     the server side of the virtual serial port is attached to a pseudo-
     terminal.  Otherwise the virtual serial port is attached to the
     stdin/stdout.  rfcomm_sppd should be run as root in order to communicate
     with sdpd(8) in this case.

     The rfcomm_sppd utility opens both master and slave pseudo terminals.
     This is done to ensure that RFCOMM connection stays open until
     rfcomm_sppd is terminated.  The data received from the master pseudo
     terminal are sent over the RFCOMM connection.  The data received from the
     RFCOMM connection are written into master pseudo terminal.  The
     application in its turn opens the slave pseudo terminal and operates on
     it just like it would operate over the standard serial port.

     The options are as follows:

     -a address
             In client mode, this required option specifies the address of the
             remote RFCOMM server.  If this option is specified in server
             mode, rfcomm_sppd will only accept connections from the Bluetooth
             device with address address.  The address can be specified as
             BD_ADDR or name.  If name was specified then rfcomm_sppd utility
             will attempt to resolve the name via bt_gethostbyname(3).

     -b      Detach from the controlling terminal, i.e., run in background.

     -c channel
             In both client and server mode, this option specifies the RFCOMM
             channel to connect to or listen on.  In server mode, the channel
             should be a number between 1 and 30.  If not specified,
             rfcomm_sppd will try to bind to “wildcard” RFCOMM channel number.
             The actual RFCOMM channel will be obtained via getsockname(2)
             call and will be used to register Serial Port service with
             sdpd(8).  In client mode, the channel could either be a number
             between 1 and 30 or a service name.  Supported service names are:
             DUN (for DialUp Networking service), FAX (for Fax service), LAN
             (for LAN Access Using PPP service) and SP (for Serial Port
             service).  If channel was not specified then rfcomm_sppd utility
             will try to obtain RFCOMM channel for Serial Port service via
             Service Discovery Protocol from the server.

     -h      Display usage message and exit.

     -S      Server mode; see DESCRIPTION.

     -t      Use slave pseudo tty.  If not set stdin/stdout will be used.
             This option is required if -b option was specified.

FILES
     /dev/pts/[num]      slave pseudo terminals

EXIT STATUS
     The rfcomm_sppd utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
           rfcomm_sppd -a 00:01:02:03:04:05 -c 1 -t

     Will start the rfcomm_sppd utility and open RFCOMM connection to the
     server at 00:01:02:03:04:05 and channel 1.  Once the connection has been
     established, a pts(4) can be used to talk to the remote serial port on
     the server.  rfcomm_sppd prints the name of the pts(4) to use on stdout.
