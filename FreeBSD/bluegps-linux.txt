NAME
       bluegps - datalog download tool for Royaltek RBT-3000 GPS

SYNOPSIS
       bluegps [-d filename] [-e] [-p password] bdaddr

DESCRIPTION
       bluegps is a simple command line tool to download datalog entries from
       the Royaltek RBT-3000 bluetooth GPS receiver. The log is written in
       NMEA-0183 format.

       The bluetooth address (bdaddr) of the RBT-3000 to be used has to be
       specified on the command line. This bluetooth address can e.g.  be
       determined using the hcitool(1) command (linux). Or alternatively use
       the friendly name. (freebsd, see bluetooth.hosts(5)).

OPTIONS
       -d filename
              Download the datalog into a file named filename.  If no -d
              option is given only the status of the datalog will be
              displayed, but no datalog will be downloaded. To print the log
              to the standard output give - as the filename.

       -e     Erase datalog. If the -d option is given as well, the datalog
              will be erase after it has been downloaded.

       -p  password
              If the RBT-3000 has been setup to use a password, it has to be
              specified using this option. bluegps will complain if a password
              is required but this option has not been specified. The password
              must consist of exactly four digits.

       -h     Display usage information.

       -q     Operate quietly. Status information will be suppressed.

       -v     Operate verbously. Additional information will be shown.

DEVICE CONFIGURATION
       -n  name
              The RBT-3000 can store a name to identify the device easily.
              This Option will set the name.

       -w  password
              Configure the RBT-3000 to use a password. The password must
              consist of exactly four digits.

       -W     Disable the password protection. Note that you need to specify
              the old password using the option -p.


LOGGING CONFIGURATION
       -l     Enable logging. This switches the RBT-3000 into logging mode.
              Note that at least one logging mode (time, distance or speed
              based) must be active for this to have an effect.

       -L     Disable logging.

       -i NUM Enable time based logging: records the position every NUM
              seconds.

       -I     Disable time based logging.

       -c NUM Enable distance based logging: records the position every NUM
              meters.

       -C     Disable distance based logging.

       -s NUM Enable speed based logging: records if the device moves faster
              than NUM km/h.

       -S     Disable speed based logging.

       -a     Include altitude information into the log.

       -A     Exclude altitude information from the log.

       -o     Enables overwriting when the internal memory for the log is
              full.

       -O     Stop logging when the internal memory for the log is full.


EXAMPLES
       To download the nmea log from the GPS with the bdaddr 00:02:C7:00:11:22
       to a file named testlog.nmea use the following command:

           bluegps -d testlog.nmea 00:02:C7:00:11:22

       On freebsd; if there is an entry in /etc/bluetooth/hosts you can also
       use:

           bluegps -d testlog.nmea BlueGPS

       If the GPS has been setup to use the password 1234 use the following
       command:

           bluegps -p 1234 -d testlog.nmea 00:02:C7:00:11:22

       If the datalog is to be erased after the download use the following
       command:

           bluegps -p 1234 -d testlog.nmea -e 00:02:C7:00:11:22
