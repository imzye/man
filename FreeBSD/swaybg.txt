NAME
       swaybg - Background for Wayland

SYNOPSIS
       swaybg [options...]

       Displays a background image on all outputs of your Wayland session.

       Without an output specified, appearance options apply to all outputs.
       Per-output appearance options can be set by passing -o, --output
       followed by these options.

OPTIONS
       -c, --color <[#]rrggbb>
           Set the background color.

       -h, --help
           Show help message and quit.

       -i, --image <path>
           Set the background image.

       -m, --mode <mode>
           Scaling mode for images: stretch, fill, fit, center, or tile. Use
           the additional mode solid_color to display only the background
           color, even if a background image is specified.

       -o, --output <name>
           Select an output to configure. Subsequent appearance options will
           only apply to this output. The special value * selects all outputs.
