NAME
       cascade - Noise and distortion analysis for cascaded systems.


SYNOPSIS
       cascade [GNU style options]

       cascade file


DESCRIPTION
       The cascade program analyzes the noise and distortion performance of a
       cascaded system.  The functional blocks in the system are each
       characterized by a gain and optionally noise figure and third order
       intercept point.  In addition a source with a particular signal level
       and noise level may be specified.  Cascade then calculates the system
       noise figure and input third order intercept at each stage.  If the
       source was specified, the signal level, carrier to noise ratio, and
       distortion level is reported at each stage in the system.

       Cascade accepts the following options.
