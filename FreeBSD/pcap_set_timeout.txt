PCAP_SET_TIMEOUT(3)    FreeBSD Library Functions Manual    PCAP_SET_TIMEOUT(3)



NAME
       pcap_set_timeout - set the packet buffer timeout for a not-yet-
       activated capture handle

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       int pcap_set_timeout(pcap_t *p, int to_ms);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_set_timeout() sets the packet buffer timeout that will be used on
       a capture handle when the handle is activated to to_ms, which is in
       units of milliseconds.  (See pcap(3) for an explanation of the packet
       buffer timeout.)

       The behavior, if the timeout isn't specified, is undefined, as is the
       behavior if the timeout is set to zero or to a negative value.  We
       recommend always setting the timeout to a non-zero value unless
       immediate mode is set, in which case the timeout has no effect.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_set_timeout() returns 0 on success or PCAP_ERROR_ACTIVATED if
       called on a capture handle that has been activated.
