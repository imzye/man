GAMMARAY(1)                          KDAB                          GAMMARAY(1)


NAME
       GammaRay - Qt-application inspection and manipulation tool.

SYNOPSIS
       gammaray [--pid <pid> | <application> <args> | --connect
       <host>[:<port>]

DESCRIPTION
       GammaRay inspects runtime internals of a Qt-application, such as:
           Object tree, properties, signal/slots, widgets, models,
           graphics views, javascript debugger, resources,
           state machines, meta types, fonts, codecs, text documents

       When run without any options, gammaray will present a list of running
       Qt-applications from which you can attach the selected injector.  Else,
       you can attach to a running process by specifying its pid, or you can
       start a new Qt-application by specifying its name (and optional
       arguments).

OPTIONS
       --help
           Print help message and exit.

       --version
           Print version information and exit.

       -p, --pid <pid>
           Attach to running Qt application with the specified pid.

       -i, --injector <injector>
           Set the specified injection type.

           Supported injectors are:
                preload (Linux, Mac OS)
                gdb (Linux. requires gdb to be installed)
                lldb (Linux. Mac OS, requires lldb to be installed)
                style
                windll (Windows)

       --inprocess
           Use the Gammaray 1.x in-process UI. This is not necessary in most
           cases, apart from using tools that do not work remotely.

       --inject-only
           This will only inject the GammaRay probe into a process, but not
           start the GammaRay UI. This is useful for example when doing remote
           debugging on embedded devices.

       --listen <address>
           Specify on which network address the GammaRay server should listen,
           default is GAMMARAY_DEFAULT_ANY_TCP_URL (ie. tcp://0.0.0.0, all of
           ipv4, use tcp://[::] for all ipv6). This can be used for example on
           Windows to avoid firewall warnings by setting the address to
           127.0.0.1 if you don't need remote access.

       --no-listen
           Disables the GammaRay server. This implies --inprocess as there is
           no other way to connect to the GammaRay probe in this case.

       --list-probes
           List all installed probes.

       --probe <abi>
           Explicitly specify which probe to use. You should use this if you
           have more than one probe installed (e.g. one for Qt4 and one for
           Qt5), until probe ABI auto-detection is implemented.

       --connect <host[:port]>
           Connect to a target with an already injected GammaRay probe. Useful
           for example for remote debugging.

       --self-test [injector]
           Run GammaRay self-tests, if an injector is specified only that
           specific one will be tested.

           The exit code is 0 on success, and 1 otherwise.

EXAMPLES
       Run gammaray on the Qt-application "qtfoo" with command line arguments
       'arg1' and 'arg2':
            % gammaray /path/to/qtfoo arg1 arg2

       Invoke gammaray on the Qt-application running with pid 1234:
            % gammaray --pid 1234

       Invoke gammaray on with injector gdb on Qt-application running with pid
       1234:
            % gammaray --injector gdb --pid 1234

EXIT STATUS
       Exits with 0 under normal operation; otherwise, exists with a positive
       integer indicating a problem occurred while launching or attaching an
       injector.
