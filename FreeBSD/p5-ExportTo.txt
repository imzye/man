NAME
       ExportTo - export any function/method to any namespace

VERSION
       Version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
        package From;

        sub function_1{
          # ...
        }

        sub function_2{
          # ...
        }

        sub function_3{
          # ...
        }

        use ExportTo (NameSpace1 => [qw/function_1 function_2/], NameSpace2 => [qw/function_3/]);

        # Now, function_1 and function_2 are exported to 'NameSpace1' namespace.
        # function_3 is exported to 'NameSpace2' namespace.

        # If 'NameSpace1'/'NameSpace2' namespace has same name function/method,
        # such a function/method is not exported and ExportTo croaks.
        # but if you want to override, you can do it as following.

        use ExportTo (NameSpace1 => [qw/+function_1 function_2/]);

        # if adding + to function/method name,
        # This override function/method which namespace already has with exported function/method.

        use ExportTo ('+NameSpace' => [qw/function_1 function_2/]);

        # if you add + to namespace name, all functions are exported even if namespace already has function/method.

        use ExportTo ('+NameSpace' => {function_ => sub{print 1}, function_2 => 'function_2'});

        # if using hashref instead of arrayref, its key is regarded as subroutine name and
        # value is regarded as its coderef/subroutine name. and this subroutine name will be exported.

DESCRIPTION
       This module allow you to export/override subroutine/method to one
       namespace.  It can be used for mix-in, for extension of modules not
       using inheritance.

FUNCTION/METHOD
       export_to
            # example 1 & 2
            export_to(PACKAGE_NAME => [qw/FUNCTION_NAME/]);
            ExportTo->export_to(PACKAGE_NAME => [qw/FUNCTION_NAME/]);

            # example 3
            ExportTo->export_to(PACKAGE_NAME => {SUBROUTINE_NAME => sub{ .... }, SUBROUTINE_NAME2 => 'FUNCTION_NAME'});

           These are as same as following.

            # example 1 & 2
            use ExportTo(PACKAGE_NAME => [qw/FUNCTION_NAME/]);

            # example 3
            use ExportTo(PACKAGE_NAME => {SUBROUTINE_NAME => sub{ .... }, SUBROUTINE_NAME2 => 'FUNCTION_NAME'});

           But, 'use' is needed to declare after declaration of
           function/method.  using 'export_to', you can write anywhere.

Export from another package to another package (with renaming).
       This is used in Util::Any.  For example, CGI::Util's "escape" function
       to other package.

        package main;
        use CGI ();

        # export CGI::Util::escape to OtherA
        use ExportTo (OtherA => ['CGI::Util::escape']);

        # export CGI::Util::escape to OtherB as cgi_escape
        use ExportTo (OtherB => {cgi_escape => \&CGI::Util::escape});

        print OtherA::escape("/"); # %2F
        print OtherB::cgi_escape("/"); # %2F

Import from another package's subroutine to current package (with renaming)
       It is as same as above.

        use CGI ();

        # export CGI::Util::escape to current package
        use ExportTo (__PACKAGE__, ['CGI::Util::escape']);

        # export CGI::Util::escape to current package as cgi_escape
        use ExportTo (__PACKAGE__, {cgi_escape => \&CGI::Util::escape});

        print main::escape("/"); # %2F
        print main::cgi_escape("/"); # %2F

       But for this purpose, Sub::Import has better interface.
