CAP_SANDBOXED(3)       FreeBSD Library Functions Manual       CAP_SANDBOXED(3)

NAME
     cap_sandboxed – Check if in a capability mode sandbox

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/capsicum.h>
     #include <stdbool.h>

     bool
     cap_sandboxed(void);

DESCRIPTION
     cap_sandboxed() returns true if the process is in a capability mode
     sandbox or false if it is not.  This function is a more handy alternative
     to the cap_getmode(2) system call as it always succeeds, so there is no
     need for error checking.  If the support for capability mode is not
     compiled into the kernel, cap_sandboxed() will always return false.

RETURN VALUES
     Function cap_sandboxed() is always successful and will return either true
     or false.

SEE ALSO
     cap_enter(2), capsicum(4)

HISTORY
     The cap_sandboxed() function first appeared in FreeBSD 9.2.

AUTHORS
