Template::Stash::AutoEscape(3)             User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Template::Stash::AutoEscape - escape automatically in Template-Toolkit.

SYNOPSIS
         use Template;
         use Template::Stash::AutoEscape;
         my $tt = Template->new({
           STASH => Template::Stash::AutoEscape->new
         });

METHODS
   new
       escape_type
         default is HTML

       method_for_raw
         default is raw, you can get not escaped value from [% value.raw %]

       escape_method
           my $tt = Template->new({
             STASH => Template::Stash::AutoEscape->new({
                 escape_method => sub { my $text = shift; ... ; return $text }
             })
           });

       ignore_escape
           my $stash = Template::Stash::AutoEscape->new({ignore_escape => [qw(include_html include_raw my_escape_func)], ... );

           You can disable auto-escape for some value or TT-Macro.
           For example: include other component, for output safety html, using other escape method, etc.

   class_for
           Template::Stash::AutoEscape->class_for("HTML") # Template::Stash::AutoEscape::Escaped::HTML
           Template::Stash::AutoEscape->class_for("HTML" => "MyHTMLString");

DESCRIPTION
       Template::Stash::AutoEscape is a sub class of Template::Stash,
       automatically escape all HTML strings and avoid XSS vulnerability.

CONFIGURE
       $Template::Stash::AutoEscape::ESCAPE_ARGS
          default is 0. for example "key of hash" or "args of vmethods" are not escaped. I think this is good in most cases.
          [% hash.${key} %] [% hash.item(key) %] means [% hash.${key.raw} | html %] [% hash.item(key.raw) | html %] by default.
