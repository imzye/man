NAME
       xcut - Manipulate X cut buffers from command line

SYNOPSIS
       xcut [-display displayname] [-p]

DESCRIPTION
       This is the manual page for xcut version 0.2.

       Xcut takes the contents of standard input and store it into the X cut
       and paste buffer.  The data is then available for pasting into
       applications which support cut and paste operations.

       I was initially looking for something that would generate canned shell
       commands and stick them in the X cut buffer so all the user needed to
       do was do hit the middle mouse button in an xterm and the commands
       would be executed. The original idea was to stick a short shell script
       to insert a MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE entry in the .Xauthority file, but I´ve
       found xcut useful for other things such as pasting the output of shell
       commands into mail messages and so forth.

OPTIONS
       -display
              Connect to the specified X host, display number and screen.

       -p     Paste contents of X cut buffer to standard output.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The DISPLAY environment variable is used for the name of the X display
       to connect to if the -display command line option is not present.

SEE ALSO
