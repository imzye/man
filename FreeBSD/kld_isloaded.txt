KLD(3)                 FreeBSD Library Functions Manual                 KLD(3)

NAME
     kld_isloaded, kld_load – kld utility functions

LIBRARY
     System Utilities Library (libutil, -lutil)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <libutil.h>

     int
     kld_isloaded(const char *name);

     int
     kld_load(const char *name);

DESCRIPTION
     These functions facilitate loading kernel modules from userland
     applications.

     The kld_isloaded() function takes a name and returns a non-zero value if
     a module of that name is currently loaded.  The name can be either the
     name of a module file (cpufreq.ko), the same name without the .ko
     extension (cpufreq), or the name of a module contained within that file
     (cpu/ichss).  Only the latter will return correct results if the module
     is compiled into the kernel.

     The kld_load() function is a simple wrapper around the kldload(2)
     function.  It returns zero if and only if the corresponding kldload()
     call succeeded or returned EEXIST (signifying that the requested module
     was already loaded).
