NAME
       openmc - Executes the OpenMC Monte Carlo code

DESCRIPTION
       This command is used to execute the OpenMC Monte Carlo code. It is
       assumed that a set of XML input files has already been created and that
       HDF5 format cross sections are available.

SYNOPSIS
       openmc [options] [path]

       path specifies either the path to a single model XML file containing
       the full model or a directory containing either a model.xml file or a
       set of individual XML files (settings.xml, materials.xml,
       geometry.xml). It is assumed that if no path is specified, the XML
       input files are present in the current directory.

OPTIONS
       -c, --volume
              Run in stochastic volume calculation mode

       -e, --event
              Run using event-based parallelism

       -g, --geometry-debug
              Run with geometry debugging turned on, where cell overlaps are
              checked for after each move of a particle

       -p, --plot
              Run in plotting mode

       -r binaryFile, --restart binaryFile
              Restart a previous run from a state point or a particle restart
              file named binaryFile.

       -s N, --threads N
              Use N OpenMP threads.

       -t, --track
              Write tracks for all particles (up to max_tracks).

       -v, --version
              Show version information.

       -h, --help
              Show help message.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The behavior of openmc is affected by the following environment
       variables.

       OPENMC_CHAIN_FILE
              Indicates the path to a depletion chain XML file.

       OPENMC_CROSS_SECTIONS
              Indicates the default path to the cross_sections.xml summary
              file that is used to locate HDF5 format cross section libraries
              if the user has not specified the <cross_sections> tag in
              materials.xml.

       OPENMC_MG_CROSS_SECTIONS
              Indicates the default path to an HDF5 file that contains multi-
              group cross section libraries if the user has not specified the
              <cross_sections> tag in materials.xml.
