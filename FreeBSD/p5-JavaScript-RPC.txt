NAME
       JavaScript::RPC - (DEPRECATED) Remote procedure calls from JavaScript

DEPRECATION NOTICE
       Brent Ashley, the author of JSRS, has stated that he has no plans to
       update his library. JavaScript RPC, more commonly known as "AJAX", has
       seen a rise in popularity and therefore many new libraries have been
       released.  You should consider those alternatives before trying to use
       this module and the JSRS library.
