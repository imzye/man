DESCRIPTION
       Terminology provides a number of companion tools to control advanced
       behavior.  They allow in-line and popup display of media files,
       enhanced file listing, and control over visual appearance.

       The escape codes used to implement these behaviors are documented in
       EXTENDED ESCAPES FOR TERMINOLOGY section of terminology(1).
