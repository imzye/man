       cvsdadm [-a] [-C] [-q] [-e] [-k] [-d] [-h] [-l]  [-r] [-w] [-v][-u

DESCRIPTION
       cvsdadm is a tool to assist CVSd administrators in the user admin of

OPTIONS
       -i interactive use, user provided with a menu
       -a add a cvs user
       -C Create mode need -R if not in interactive mode
       -k kill a cvs user

       -e enable a cvs user account
       -h print help and exit
       -l print a listing of all user
       -q query the repository about a user
       -u cvs_userid
       -p cvs_user_passwd
       -s system_user_cvs_user_maps_to
       -R full_or_relative_path_to_repository
       -w specify for cvs writers access
       -r specify for cvs readers access
       -v print version and exit

       EXAMPLES

       In the following examples % is the command prompt. A short description
       following the example describes whats going on in each.

       % cvsdadm -i

       This will start cvsdadm's interactive user menu. This will allow the
       user to perform cvsdadm functions interactively.

       % cvsdadm -q -u username

       Allows the user to query the cvs repositories

       % cvsdadm -C -R ./Ports

       The above will create all the repository files in Ports directory but
       not the Ports directory itself.

       % cvsdadm -C -[adkeq] -u you -p password -R Ports

       The above have two behavior. First, it will create the repository if it
       not already created. Second if the repository is created but some files
       are missing, it will create these files before any -adkeq operations.
       No file will be overwritten, so -C is not dangerous for your existing
       repository!

       % cvsdadm -i -C

       The above is the same as the previous one but will work in interactive
       mode

       % cvsdadm -a -u username -p userpasswd -R /repos -w

       The above will add username with userpasswd to the cvs repository
       located at /repos with writers priviledges.

       % cvsdadm -a -u username -p userpasswd -s systemusername -R /repos -w

       The above will add username with userpasswd mapped to systemusername in
       cvs repository /repos with writers priviledges.

       NOTE: The above two commands can be executed with -r as well, instead
       of -w. If executed with -r, the cvs users priviledges will be that of a
       cvs repository reader rather than writer.

       % cvsdadm -k -u username -R /repos

       This kills the cvs user username in the cvs repository /repos. Their
       cvs account will no longer exist after this command is issued.

       % cvsdadm -e -u username -R /repos

       This command re-enables a disabled cvs user in cvs repository /repos.

       % cvsdadm -d -u username -R /repos

       This command disables a cvs user in cvs repository /repos.

       % cvsdadm -l

       This command will print a listing of all CVS user. If you want a full
       listing of CVS user you could  make this command in a for loop like the
       example below (rc shell)

       % for ( i in `{cvsdadm -l ⎪grep -v '>')} {cvsdadm -q -u $i}

       % cvsdadm -h

       This command will display some cvsdadm help.
