Name
       renamex - file rename tool


SYNOPSIS
       renamex [options] files ...


DESCRIPTION
       Renamex is a small and quick tool written in C to rename files.  It can
       change, lowercase and uppercase the names of a batch of files, or
       change the files' ownership.  Renamex is powered by the extended
       regular expression for searching and substituting string patterns in
       the names.


OPTIONS
       -l, --lowercase
              Lowercase specified filenames.


       -u, --uppercase
              Uppercase specified filenames.


       -R, --recursive
              Perform on the specified files and all subdirectories.


       -t, --test
              Test only mode. It won't change anything, just test the result
              of searching and substituting.


       -f, --file
              Load file names from the specified files.


       -o, --owner  OWNER
              Change the ownership of the specified files to OWNER.
              (superuser only)


       -v, --verbose
              verbose display.


       -A, --always
              Always overwrite the existed files


       -N, --never
              Never overwrite the existed files, discard the renaming process
              instead


       -s/PATTERN/STRING[/SW]
              Substitute PATTERN with STRING in the filenames.  renamex will
              searching the PATTERN in the names. If the PATTERN matches, it
              would be replaced by the specified STRING and then call the
              system call to change the file's name.  SW can be combined by
              the following switches:

              g      replace all occurrences in the filename.

              i      ignore case when searching.

              b      backward searching and substituting. This does not
                     support regular expression.

              s      change file's suffix. In this case, the PATTERN should be
                     some kind of filename suffix.

              r      declare that PATTERN is a regular expression.

              e      declare that PATTERN is an extended regular expression.

              1-9    replace 1 to 9 occurrences in the filename.


REGULAR EXPRESSION
       This section about extended regular expression is digisted from the
       manpage of fgrep(1).  See it for details.

       A regular expression is a pattern that describes a set of strings.
       Regular expressions are constructed analogously to arithmetic
       expressions, by using various operators to combine smaller expressions.

       The fundamental building blocks are the regular expressions that match
       a single character.  Most characters, including all letters and digits,
       are regular expressions that match themselves.  Any metacharacter with
       special meaning may be quoted by preceding it with a backslash.

       A list of characters enclosed by [ and ] matches any single character
       in that list; if the first character of the list is the caret ^ then it
       matches any character not in the list.  For example, the regular
       expression [0123456789] matches any single digit.  A range of ASCII
       characters may be specified by giving the first and last characters,
       separated by a hyphen.  Finally, certain named classes of characters
       are predefined.  Their names are self explanatory, and they are
       [:alnum:], [:alpha:], [:cntrl:], [:digit:], [:graph:], [:lower:],
       [:print:], [:punct:], [:space:], [:upper:], and [:xdigit:].  For
       example, [[:alnum:]] means [0-9A-Za-z], except the latter form is
       dependent upon the ASCII character encoding, whereas the former is
       portable.  (Note that the brackets in these class names are part of the
       symbolic names, and must be included in addition to the brackets
       delimiting the bracket list.)  Most metacharacters lose their special
       meaning inside lists.  To include a literal ] place it first in the
       list.  Similarly, to include a literal ^ place it anywhere but first.
       Finally, to include a literal - place it last.

       The period .  matches any single character.  The symbol \w is a synonym
       for [[:alnum:]] and \W is a synonym for [^[:alnum]].

       The caret ^ and the dollar sign $ are metacharacters that respectively
       match the empty string at the beginning and end of a line.  The symbols
       \< and \> respectively match the empty string at the beginning and end
       of a word.  The symbol \b matches the empty string at the edge of a
       word, and \B matches the empty string provided it's not at the edge of
       a word.

       A regular expression may be followed by one of several repetition
       operators:
       ?      The preceding item is optional and matched at most once.
       *      The preceding item will be matched zero or more times.
       +      The preceding item will be matched one or more times.
       {n}    The preceding item is matched exactly n times.
       {n,}   The preceding item is matched n or more times.
       {,m}   The preceding item is optional and is matched at most m times.
       {n,m}  The preceding item is matched at least n times, but not more
              than m times.

       Two regular expressions may be concatenated; the resulting regular
       expression matches any string formed by concatenating two substrings
       that respectively match the concatenated subexpressions.

       Two regular expressions may be joined by the infix operator |; the
       resulting regular expression matches any string matching either
       subexpression.

       Repetition takes precedence over concatenation, which in turn takes
       precedence over alternation.  A whole subexpression may be enclosed in
       parentheses to override these precedence rules.

       The backreference \n, where n is a single digit, matches the substring
       previously matched by the nth parenthesized subexpression of the
       regular expression.

       In basic regular expressions the metacharacters ?, +, {, |, (, and )
       lose their special meaning; instead use the backslashed versions \?,
       \+, \{, \|, \(, and \).

EXAMPLES
       renamex -l -R *
              To lowercase all files' names recursively.


       renamex -u -s/abc/xyz/gi *.c
              Substitute all abc substrings appeared in C  sources  files
              with xyz , ignoring the case, then uppercase the whole file
              name.


       renamex -v -s/.c/.cpp/s *
              Find all files with the '.c' suffix in the current directory and
              change them to '.cpp' suffix. Print the verbose information.


       find . -name *.c > filename.lst

       renamex -s/.c/.cpp/s -f filename.lst
              Find all files with the '.c' suffix under the current directory
              and change them to '.cpp' suffix by the list file.


       renamex -s/abc/12345/bi *
              Read names from the 'filename.lst' , find the last occurrence of
              'abc' and  replace it with '12345' , ignoring the case.


       renamex -s/^[A-Z].*file/nofile/r *
              The target substring starts with a capital letter, and ends with
              string 'file' .  There are 0 or any numbers of characters
              between the capital letter and 'file' .  The substring, if
              encountered in filenames, will be replaced with 'nofile'.


       renamex -s/^[A-Z].+file/nofile/eg *
              Similar to above, except it uses extended regular expression,
              such as the '+' metacharacter, and replaces all matching strings
              with 'nofile'.


       renamex -t -s/^[A-Z].+file/nofile/eg *
              Testmode only. Simulate the rename process but no files would be
              actually changed.


       renamex -o guest -R /home/custom
              change the ownership of '/home/custom' to 'guest' .  The 'guest'
              should be an effective user in the current system. If
              '/home/custom' is a directory, all files' ownership in this
              directory tree will be changed to 'guest' .
