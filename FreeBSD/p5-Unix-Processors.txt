NAME
       Unix::Processors - Interface to processor (CPU) information

SYNOPSIS
         use Unix::Processors;

         my $procs = new Unix::Processors;
         print "There are ", $procs->max_online, " CPUs at ", $procs->max_clock, "\n";
         if ($procs->max_online != $procs->max_physical) {
             print "Hyperthreading between ",$procs->max_physical," physical CPUs.\n";
         }
         (my $FORMAT =   "%2s  %-8s     %4s    \n") =~ s/\s\s+/ /g;
         printf($FORMAT, "#", "STATE", "CLOCK",  "TYPE", );
         foreach my $proc (@{$procs->processors}) {
             printf ($FORMAT, $proc->id, $proc->state, $proc->clock, $proc->type);
         }

DESCRIPTION
       This package provides accessors to per-processor (CPU) information.
       The object is obtained with the Unix::Processors::processors call.  the
       operating system in a OS independent manner.

       max_online
           Return number of threading processors currently online.  On
           hyperthreaded Linux systems, this indicates the maximum number of
           simultaneous threads that may execute; see max_physical for the
           real physical CPU count.

       max_physical
           Return number of physical processor cores currently online.  For
           example, a single chip quad-core processor returns four.

       max_socket
           Returns the number of populated CPU sockets, if known, else the
           same number as max_physical.  For example, a single chip quad-core
           processor returns one.

       max_clock
           Return the maximum clock speed across all online processors. Not
           all OSes support this call.

       processors
           Return an array of processor references.  See the
           Unix::Processors::Info manual page.  Not all OSes support this
           call.
