CGI::Cookie::Splitter(3)                   User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       CGI::Cookie::Splitter - Split big cookies into smaller ones.

VERSION
       version 0.05

SYNOPSIS
           use CGI::Cookie::Splitter;

           my $splitter = CGI::Cookie::Splitter->new(
               size => 123, # defaults to 4096
           );

           @small_cookies = $splitter->split( @big_cookies );

           @big_cookies = $splitter->join( @small_cookies );

DESCRIPTION
       RFC 2109 recommends that the minimal cookie size supported by the
       client is 4096 bytes. This has become a pretty standard value, and if
       your server sends larger cookies than that it's considered a no-no.

       This module provides a pretty simple interface to generate small
       cookies that are under a certain limit, without wasting too much
       effort.

METHODS
   new
           $splitter = CGI::Cookie::Splitter->new(%params)

       The only supported parameters right now are "size". It defaults to
       4096.

   split
           @cookies = $splitter->split(@cookies)

       This method accepts a list of CGI::Cookie objects (or lookalikes) and
       returns a list of CGI::Cookies.

       Whenever an object with a total size that is bigger than the limit
       specified at construction time is encountered it is replaced in the
       result list with several objects of the same class, which are assigned
       serial names and have a smaller size and the same
       domain/path/expires/secure parameters.

   join
           $cookie = $splitter->join(@cookies)

       This is the inverse of "split".

   should_split
           $splitter->should_split($cookie)

       Whether or not the cookie should be split

   mangle_name_next
           $splitter->mangle_name_next($name)

   mangle_name
           $splitter->mangle_name($name, $index)

   demangle_name
           $splitter->demangle_name($mangled_name)

       These methods encapsulate a name mangling scheme for changing the
       cookie names to allow a 1:n relationship.

       The default mangling behavior is not 100% safe because cookies with a
       safe size are not mangled.

       As long as your cookie names don't start with the substring
       "_bigcookie_" you should be OK ;-)

       Demangles name, increments the index and remangles.

SUBCLASSING
       This module is designed to be easily subclassed... If you need to split
       cookies using a different criteria then you should look into that.
