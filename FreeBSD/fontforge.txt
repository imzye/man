FONTFORGE(1)            FreeBSD General Commands Manual           FONTFORGE(1)

NAME
       fontforge - create, modify, and view font files

SYNOPSIS
       fontforge [-allglyphs] [-c string] [-cmap maptype] [-depth pixeld]
       [-display str] [-lang=ff] [-lang=py] [-help] [-keyboard ktype] [-last]
       [-new] [-nosplash] [-quiet] [-recover mode] [-script file]
       [-skippyfile] [-skippyplug] [-sync] [-unique] [-usage] [-vc class]
       [-version] [fontfile ...]

DESCRIPTION
       FontForge will read PostScript (pfa, pfb, ps, cid), OpenType (otf),
       TrueType (ttf, ttc), Macintosh resource fonts (dfont, bin, hqx), Scaled
       Vector Graphics (svg), TeX bitmap (pk), Glyph Bitmap Distribution
       Format (bdf), and X11 bitmap (pcf) fonts.  Font files may be compressed
       with gzip (for example, myfont.pcf.gz).  FontForge will also read its
       own format: Spline Font Database (sfd) files.

       If the argument list contains a font file name (or several), fontforge
       opens a fontview window for each font displaying the characters of that
       font.  In the absence of options or arguments, the program opens a
       file-picker window, allowing you to browse your disk to find a font
       file, or create a new one.

       This manual page is intended only as a rudimentary overview; see the
       HTML Users Manual for more complete information.

       If no fontfiles are specified, and neither is -new, and there is
       nothing to recover, then FontForge will produce an open font dialogue
       box.

       If a scriptfile is specified then FontForge will not open the X
       display, nor will it process any additional arguments. It will execute
       the scriptfile and give it any remaining arguments

       If the first argument is an executable filename, and that file's first
       line contains "fontforge", then it will be treated as a scriptfile.

OPTIONS
       -new        Creates a new font.

       -last       Loads the last sfd file closed.

       -recover none|auto|inquire|clean
                   Control error recovery.  none suppresses crash revcovery.
                   auto performs automatic recover if the program crashed
                   before saving changes; this is the default.  inquire asks
                   what to do with auto-saved crash recovery files.  clean
                   deletes recovery information.

       -allglyphs  Load all glyphs in the 'glyf' table. of a TrueType
                   collection.

       -nosplash   Suppress display of the splash screen.

       -quiet      Don't print non-essential information to stderr.

       -unique     If a copy of fontforge is already running, open all
                   arguments in it and have this process exit.

       -display display-name
                   Employ the X display specified by the string display-name
                   (for example: localhost:0).

       -depth pixeld
                   Attempt to employ a visual that matches the specified pixel
                   depth, pixeld.

       -vc val     Sets the visual class if possible.

       -cmap current|copy|private
                   Sets the type of color map.  current attempts to allocate
                   colors int he current (shared) color map.  The program will
                   likely not find everything it requires.  copy allocates
                   what can be allocated, then copies the current color map;
                   it can thus make use of cells other programs are using.
                   private creates a new color map and fills it with the
                   required colors.

       -dontopenxdevices
                   In case that fails.

       -sync       Syncs the display, debugging.

       -keyboard ibm|mac|sun|ppc
                   Generates appropriate hotkeys in menus.  Use ibm on an IBM-
                   compatible PC.  Use mac on a Mac computer running Mac OS.
                   Use sun on a Sun workstation.  Use ppc on Power PC Mac
                   running SUSE GNU/Linux.

       -usecairo=yes|no
                   Use (or not) the cairo library for drawing.

       -help       Displays a help message and exits.

       -docs       Displays help file output and then invokes a browser using
                   the BROWSER environment variable.

       -version    Prints the version of fontforge and exits.

       -lang=py    Use Python for scripts (may precede -script).

       -lang=ff    Use fontforge's legacy scripting language.

       -script scriptfile
                   Executes scriptfile.  Must be the first option (or follow
                   -lang).  All other arguments are passed to scriptfile.
                   Execute the script named file.  Does not open the X
                   display.  This must be the first argument passed to
                   FontForge.  Any other arguments are handled by the script
                   file itself.  Any other command line arguments will be
                   passed to the script.  The program contains a command
                   interpreter, which allows access to most but not all of its
                   interactive features.  If a script file is executable, and
                   if its first line contains the string "fontforge", then the
                   argument -script may be omitted.  This means that FontForge
                   can be used as an interpreter.

       -dry scriptfile
                   Syntax checks scriptfile (dry run).  Must be the first
                   option.  All other arguments are passed to scriptfile.
                   This option can only be used with fontforge's own scripting
                   language, not with Python.

       -c script-string
                   Executes argument as scripting commands.  Must be the first
                   option.  All other arguments are passed to the script.

       -skippyfile Do not execute Python init scripts when initializing.

       -skippyplug Do not load (enabled) Python plugins when initializing.
