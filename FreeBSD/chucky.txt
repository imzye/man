chucky(7)          FreeBSD Miscellaneous Information Manual          chucky(7)



NAME
       chucky

SYNOPSIS
       chucky

       chucky -b -o -u -t

       chucky -b -a > save.shar


DESCRIPTION
       This program reads /var/db/pkg/local.sqlite and compares install
       timestamp with date in $FreeBSD header in the Makefile of the port. If
       there is no $FreeBSD header then it is assumed to be a beta port.

       NOTE: shar files are created with absolute path (ie /usr/ports/src/dir)
       so executing them will restore to that path. Multiple shars are
       concatenated by chucky stripping the 'exit' command from the output.
       (ie there is no 'exit' in the shar output. the shar output is to
       stdout, if you want to save:

       # chucky -b -a > save.shar

       This will save all the ports marked 'beta' in the save.shar archive, in
       the cwd.


OPTIONS
       -u     Display installed ports with update status only.

       -o     Display installed ports with current status only

       -b     Display installed ports with beta status only

       -t     Include timestamps in display (debug, etc)

       -a     Create shar of files (useful with -b). (Output to stdout).

       -h     Display help text.

       -i     Ignore fread() errors.

              ** if you are working on developing ports outside the ports tree
              you may receive an error because the port is listed in the
              database but does not exist in the ports tree. if you use the -i
              flag it will continue without an error message.


FILES
       Chucky uses /var/db/pkg/local.sqlite which is created/managed by
       /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/pkg.
