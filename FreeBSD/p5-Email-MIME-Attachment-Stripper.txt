Email::MIME::Attachment::Stripper(3)       User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Email::MIME::Attachment::Stripper - strip the attachments from an email

VERSION
       version 1.317

SYNOPSIS
         my $stripper = Email::MIME::Attachment::Stripper->new($mail);

         my $msg = $stripper->message;
         my @attachments = $stripper->attachments;

DESCRIPTION
       Given a Email::MIME object, detach all attachments from the message and
       make them available separately.

       The message you're left with might still be multipart, but it should
       only be multipart/alternative or multipart/related.

       Given this message:

         + multipart/mixed
           - text/plain
           - application/pdf; disposition=attachment

       The PDF will be stripped.  Whether the returned message is a single
       text/plain part or a multipart/mixed message with only the text/plain
       part remaining in it is not yet guaranteed one way or the other.

METHODS
   new
         my $stripper = Email::MIME::Attachment::Stripper->new($email, %args);

       The constructor may be passed an Email::MIME object, a reference to a
       string, or any other value that Email::Abstract (if available) can cast
       to an Email::MIME object.

       Valid arguments include:

         force_filename - try harder to get a filename, making one up if necessary

   message
         my $email_mime = $stripper->message;

       This returns the message with all the attachments detached. This will
       alter both the body and the header of the message.

   attachments
         my @attachments = $stripper->attachments;

       This returns a list of all the attachments we found in the message, as
       a hash of { filename, content_type, payload }.

       This may contain parts that might not normally be considered
       attachments, like text/html or multipart/alternative.

ATTENTION!
       This module's behavior has never been very clearly spelled out, and it
       has led to misunderstandings and bug reports, which may or may not be
       actual bugs.  I plan to take some significant action to address this.
