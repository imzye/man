NAME
     hv_kvp_daemon – Hyper-V Key Value Pair Daemon

SYNOPSIS
     hv_kvp_daemon [-dn]

DESCRIPTION
     The hv_kvp_daemon daemon provides the ability to store, retrieve, modify
     and delete Key Value pairs for FreeBSD guest partitions running on Hyper-
     V.

     Hyper-V allows administrators to store custom metadata in the form of Key
     Value pairs inside the FreeBSD guest partition.  Administrators can use
     Windows Powershell scripts to add, read, modify and delete such Key Value
     pairs.

     The hv_kvp_daemon accepts Key Value pair management requests from the
     hv_utils(4) driver and performs the actual metadata management on the
     file-system.

     The same daemon and driver combination is also used to set and get IP
     addresses from a FreeBSD guest.

     The set functionality is particularly useful when the FreeBSD guest is
     assigned a static IP address and is failed over from one Hyper-V host to
     another.  After failover, Hyper-V uses the set IP functionality to
     automatically update the FreeBSD guest's IP address to its original
     static value.

     On the other hand, the get IP functionality is used to update the guest
     IP address in the Hyper-V management console window.

     The options are as follows:

     -d      Run as regular process instead of a daemon for debugging purpose.

     -n      Generate debugging output.

     Support for Hyper-V in the form of ports was first released in September

     Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Network Appliance Inc..
