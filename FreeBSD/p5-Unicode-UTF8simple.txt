NAME
       Unicode::UTF8simple - Conversions to/from UTF8 from/to charactersets

SYNOPSIS
        use Unicode::UTF8simple;

        my $uref = new Unicode::UTF8simple;

        #convert a string (here: schön) to a utf8 byte string
        my $utf8string=$uref->toUTF8("iso-8859-1","schön");

        #convert a string from utf-8 to specified encoding
        my $string=$uref->fromUTF8("iso-8859-1",$utf8string);

        #get a lit of supported encodings:
        my @listOfNames=$uref->enclist();

        #check if a given encoding (here gb2312) is supported
        if ($uref->encsup('gb2312')){ ... }

DESCRIPTION
       Provides UTF-8 conversion for perl versions from 5.00 and up.  It was
       mainly written for use with perl 5.00 to 5.6.0 because those perl
       versions do not support Unicode::MapUTF8 or Encode.

       Unicode::UTF8simple is written in plain perl (no C code) and will work
       with any Perl 5 version. It is just slightly slower than Encode.
