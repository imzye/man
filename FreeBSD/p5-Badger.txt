NAME
       Badger - Perl Application Programming Toolkit

SYNOPSIS
           use Badger
               lib        => '../lib',     # like 'use lib' but relative to $Bin
               Filesystem => 'File Dir',   # import from Badger::Filesystem

           use Badger
               Filesystem => 'Dir File',
               Utils      => 'numlike textlike',
               Constants  => 'ARRAY HASH',
               Codecs     => [codec => 'base64'];

       This is equivalent to:

           use Badger;
           use Badger::Filesystem 'Dir File';
           use Badger::Utils      'numlike textlike',
           use Badger::Constants  'ARRAY HASH',
           use Badger::Codecs      codec => 'base64';

DESCRIPTION
       The Badger toolkit is a collection of Perl modules designed to simplify
       the process of building object-oriented Perl applications. It provides
       a set of foundation classes upon which you can quickly build robust and
       reliable systems that are simple, sexy and scalable.  See
       "Badger::Intro" for further information.

       The "Badger" module is a front-end to other "Badger" modules.  You can
       use it to import any of the exportable items from any other "Badger"
       module.  Simply specify the module name, minus the "Badger::" prefix as
       a load option.

       For example:

           use Badger
               Filesystem => 'Dir File',
               Utils      => 'numlike textlike',
               Constants  => 'ARRAY HASH',
               Codecs     => [codec => 'base64'];

       This is equivalent to:

           use Badger;
           use Badger::Filesystem 'Dir File';
           use Badger::Utils      'numlike textlike',
           use Badger::Constants  'ARRAY HASH',
           use Badger::Codecs      codec => 'base64';

       Note that multiple arguments for a module should be defined as a list
       reference.

           use Badger
               ...etc...
               Codecs => [codec => 'base64'];

       This is equivalent to:

           use Badger::Codecs [codec => 'base64'];

       Which is also equivalent to:

           use Badger::Codecs codec => 'base64';

EXPORT HOOKS
       The "Badger" module can import items from any other "Badger::*" module,
       as shown in the examples above.  The following export hook is also
       provided.

   lib
       This performs the same task as "use lib" in adding a directory to your
       @INC module include path.  However, there are two differences.  First,
       you can specify a directory relative to the directory in which the
       script exists.

           use Badger lib => '../perl/lib';

       For example, consider a directory layout like this:

           my_project/
               bin/
                   example_script.pl
               perl/
                   lib/
                       My/
                           Module.pm
                   t/
                       my_module.t

       The my_project/example_script.pl can be written like so:

           #!/usr/bin/perl

           use Badger lib => '../perl/lib';
           use My::Module;

           # your code here...

       This adds my_project/perl/lib to the include path so that the
       "My::Module" module can be correctly located.  It is equivalent to the
       following code using the FindBin module.

           #!/usr/bin/perl

           use FindBin '$Bin';
           use lib "$Bin/../perl/lib";
           use My::Module;

METHODS
   hub()
       Returns a Badger::Hub object.

   codec()
       Delegates to the Badger::Hub codec() method to return a Badger::Codec
       object.

           my $base64  = Badger->codec('base64');
           my $encoded = $base64->encode($uncoded);
           my $decoded = $base64->decode($encoded);

   config()
       Delegates to the Badger::Hub codec() method to return a Badger::Config
       object.  This is still experimental.

TODO
       Other methods like codec() to access different "Badger" modules.  These
       should be generated dynamically on demand.
