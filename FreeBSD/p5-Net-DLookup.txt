NAME
       Net::DLookup - Perform domain lookups on 2-letter and 3-letter TLDs

SYNOPSIS
            use Net::DLookup;

            # Initialize Net::DLookup object
            my $dlu = Net::DLookup -> new;

            # Replace domain definitions from a file
            $dlu -> LoadTLD($file, 1);

            # Add domain definitions from a file
            $dlu -> LoadTLD($file, 0);

            # Check domain name validity and assign it to the object
            @errors = $dlu -> IsValid($domain);

            # Return availability
            @response = $dlu -> DoWhois(0);

            # Return availability and registrar information
            @response = $dlu -> DoWhois(1);

DESCRIPTION
       Net::DLookup performs domain lookups for 2-letter and 3-letter top
       level domains.  It also verifies the validity of domain names by
       checking punctuation, length, metacharacters, etc..

       Information for currently recognized top level domains is included
       within the module. This list may be replaced or added to by calling
       $dlu->LoadTLD().

       With the advent of new registrars for 3-letter top level domains, it's
       become difficult to get the whois output from a single domain lookup,
       unless you know what registration agency to look at.  Net::DLookup
       solves this problem by checking Internic's database first and then
       performing a second query to the respective registrar for full whois
       output.

USAGE
       These functions must be used in order:

       Of course:

            use Net::DLookup;

       Create an object that contains the default top level domains.

            my $dlu = Net::DLookup -> new;

       Validate domain name ($domaintocheck) and associate it with the object.
       This must be the full domain name, such as yourdomain.com.

            my @errors = $dlu -> IsValid($domaintocheck);

       It checks for the following possible errors:

       Is 67 characters or less for 3-letter TLDs
       Is not a 3rd level domain for 3-letter TLDs (me.yourdomain.com)
       Is 26 characters or less for 2-letter TLDs
       Is not a 4th level domain for 2-letter TLDs (me.yourdomain.co.uk)
       Does not start or end with a non-alphanumeric character
       Does not contain non alphanumeric characters (except a dash) within the
       domain name
       Is a valid TLD*

       * All CCTLDs (Country Code TLDs) currently listed at IANA as well as
       the .com, .net, .org, .edu and .mil are checked

       @errors will contain a list of all possible errors that the domain name
       may have, such as:

       Domain name can't start or end with non-alphanumeric character.
       Domains with the .com extension cannot exceed 67 characters.

       Last, the domain lookup.

            @response = $domain->Net::DLookup::DoWhois();

       Is domain registered?   1 for yes; 0 for no
       Name of Registration Agency or Country
       URL of Registration Agency for TLD
       Whois Server for TLD
       Whois Output
       A "worded" reponse for domain availability "{domain} is available"

       If you're looking up a 3-letter TLD domain (.com, .net, .org, .edu and
       .mil), you have the choice to NOT perform the second lookup.  This
       would be useful if you're just checking for domain availability and
       don't care who's already registered it.  You can disable the second
       lookup by removing the 1.  This will give you Internic's plain Jane,
       uninformative whois information.

            @response = $domain->Net::DLookup::DoWhois(1);

RESTRICTIONS
       Net::DLookup requires that the Sockets (included with the Perl
       distribution) module is installed.

VERSION
       Net::DLookup Version 1.01  6/10/2000

CAVEATS
       Registration agencies are finicky beasts.  They may change their whois
       server, urls, or responses (that this module relies on) without notice.
       As of 6/10/2000, the agency data in the module is accurate.

CREDITS
       Many thanks goes to Michael Chase for the new LoadTLD() and DumpTLD()
       routines.
