RINT(3)                FreeBSD Library Functions Manual                RINT(3)

NAME
     nearbyint, nearbyintf, nearbyintl, rint, rintf, rintl – round to integral
     value in floating-point format

LIBRARY
     Math Library (libm, -lm)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <math.h>

     double
     nearbyint(double x);

     float
     nearbyintf(float x);

     long double
     nearbyintl(long double x);

     double
     rint(double x);

     float
     rintf(float x);

     long double
     rintl(long double x);

DESCRIPTION
     The rint(), rintf(), and rintl() functions return the integral value
     nearest to x according to the prevailing rounding mode.  These functions
     raise an inexact exception when the original argument is not an exact
     integer.

     The nearbyint(), nearbyintf(), and nearbyintl() functions perform the
     same operation, except that they do not raise an inexact exception.

SEE ALSO
     abs(3), ceil(3), fabs(3), fenv(3), floor(3), ieee(3), lrint(3),
     lround(3), math(3), round(3)

STANDARDS
     These functions conform to ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (“ISO C99”).

HISTORY
     A rint() function appeared in Version 6 AT&T UNIX.  The nearbyint() and
     nearbyintf() functions appeared in FreeBSD 5.3, and the long double
     variants were first available in FreeBSD 8.0.
