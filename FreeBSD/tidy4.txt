NAME
       tidy4 - validate, correct, and pretty-print HTML files

SYNOPSIS
       tidy4 [-ioucnmeqh] [-config configuration-file] [-indent] [-omit]
       [-wrap column] [-upper] [-clean] [-preserve] [-raw | -ascii | -latin1 |
       -iso2022 | -utf8 | -mac] [-numeric] [-modify] [-errors] [-quiet] [-f
       error-file] [-xml] [-asxml] [-slides] [-help] [--configuration-option
       value] file...

OPTIONS
       -config configuration-file
              Set options from configuration-file.

       -indent, -i
              Indent contents of elements (by default using 2 spaces).

       -omit, -o
              Omit optional endtags.

       -wrap column
              Wrap output at column column.  (The default is 68.)

       -upper, -u
              Output tags in upper case (the default is lower case).  If -xml
              is specified, the original case is preserved, and this option
              has no effect.  Also note that it doesn't affect attribute
              names.

       -clean, -c
              Replace <FONT>, <NOBR>, and <CENTER> tags with style properties
              and rules using CSS (Cascaded Style Sheets).

       -raw   Output characters with values higher than 127 unchanged.

       -ascii Use Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1) for input, and US ASCII for output.

       -latin1
              Use Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1) for both input and output.

       -iso2022
              Use ISO 2022 for both input and output.

       -utf8  Use UTF-8 for both input and output.

       -mac   Use MacRoman for input.

       -numeric, -n
              Output numeric rather than named entities.

       -modify, -m
              Modify original files in place.

       -errors, -e
              Only show errors.  The original files will not be modified.

       -quiet, -q
              Supress non-essential output (i.e. the welcome message and the
              summary report).

       -f error-file
              Write errors to error-file.

       -xml   Input is well-formed XML.

       -asxml Convert HTML to well-formed XML.

       -slides
              Burst into slides on <H2> elements.

       -preserve
              Preserve source file entities as is.

       -help, -h
              List command-line options.

       --configuration-option value
              Set configuration-option to value.

ENVIRONMENT
       HTML_TIDY
              Name of the default configuration file.  This should be an
              absolute path, since you will probably invoke tidy4 from
              different directories.  The value of HTML_TIDY will be parsed
              after the compiled-in default (defined with -DCONFIG_FILE), but
              before any of the files specified using -config.

EXIT STATUS
       0      All input files were processed successfully.

       1      There were warnings.

       2      There were errors.
