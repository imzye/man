NAME
     cardbus – CardBus bus driver

SYNOPSIS
     device cardbus

DESCRIPTION
     The cardbus driver implements the CardBus bus.  The cardbus driver
     supports all cardbus bridges in the system.

TUNABLES
     The driver supports the following tunable parameters, which may be added
     to /boot/loader.conf or set via the sysctl(8) command:
     hw.cardbus.debug          Non-zero values cause more verbose information
                               to be printed when a 32-bit CardBus card is
                               inserted or removed.
     hw.cardbus.cis_debug      Non-zero value causes the CIS parsing of the
                               32-bit CardBus card to be much more verbose and
                               include a complete CIS dump.
