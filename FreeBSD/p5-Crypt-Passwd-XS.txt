Crypt::Passwd::XS(3)  User Contributed Perl Documentation Crypt::Passwd::XS(3)


NAME
       Crypt::Passwd::XS - Full XS implementation of common crypt() algorithms

SYNOPSIS
         use Crypt::Passwd::XS;

         my $plaintext = 'secret';
         my $salt      = '$1$1234';
         my $crypted   = Crypt::Passwd::XS::crypt( $plaintext, $salt );

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides several common crypt() schemes as full XS
       implementations.  It allows you to validate crypted passwords that were
       hashed using a scheme that the system's native crypt() implementation
       does not support.

   Description of functions
       The crypt() function handles all supported crypt methods using the
       standard salt prefix system for determinging the crypt type.

       The unix_md5_crypt() function performs a MD5 crypt regardless of the
       salt prefix.

       The apache_md5_crypt() function performs a APR1 crypt regardless of the
       salt prefix.

       The unix_des_crypt() funtion performs a traditional DES crypt
       regardless of the salt prefix.

       The unix_sha256_crypt() function performs a SHA256 crypt regardless of
       the salt prefix.

       The unix_sha512_crypt() function performs a SHA512 crypt regardless of
       the salt prefix.

TODO
       The blowfish and Sun crypt() schemes are currently unsupported.
