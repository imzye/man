NAME
       prtunnel - tunnels TCP connections through HTTP or SOCKS5 proxies

SYNOPSIS
       prtunnel [-DVc6hv] [-t proxy-type] [-H proxy-host] [-P proxy-port] [-T
       address] [-u username] [-p password] [--password-prompt] [--http-1.0]
       [--telnet-keep-alive interval] [--crlf-keep-alive interval] [--irc-
       auto-pong] [--timeout time] [--server-timeout time] [--help]
       [--version] local-port [remote-host remote-port]

DESCRIPTION
       prtunnel tunnels TCP connections through an HTTP or SOCKS5 proxy
       server. It is useful if you're behind such a proxy and want to use a
       program that doesn't have native proxy support.

       local-port is the port that prtunnel will listen for a connection on.
       remote-host and remote-port are the hostname/address and port,
       respectively, of the remote server that the connection will be tunneled
       to.

       If run without the <remote host> and <remote port> arguments, prtunnel
       will accept SOCKS4/SOCKS5 commands from the client to determine the
       remote server to connect to.

OPTIONS
       -D     Run as a daemon. prtunnel will run in the background and accept
              multiple TCP connections with this option.

       -V     Turns on verbose output; all data transferred will be printed to
              standard output

       -c     Use color to differentiate between incoming and outgoing data in
              verbose output; without this, each line of outgoing verbose
              output will begin with ">>> " and incoming output with "<<< "

       -6     Enables IPv6 mode. This doesn't affect the way outgoing
              connections are made with the direct/direct6 tunneling modes;
              direct will always connect with IPv4 and direct6 will always
              connect with IPv6.

       -t tunnel-mode
              Set tunneling mode; http (default), socks5, direct and direct6
              are supported. With http and socks5, you must specify the
              address of an http/socks5 proxy to use. direct will make
              prtunnel connect directly to the remote host specified; direct6
              does the same, but with IPv6 instead of IPv4.

       -H proxy-host
              Set proxy server hostname

       -P proxy-port
              Set proxy server port; defaults are 8080 for http, 1080 for
              socks5

       -T address
              Add a trusted address. For security reasons, only localhost is
              trusted by default. Only connections from trusted addresses are
              allowed. You can specify an address itself (like 10.0.0.0), or
              in the form of address/bitcheck, where bitcheck is the number of
              leading bits to compare; for example, 10.0.0.0/24 would mean any
              address in the range of 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.0.255.

       -u username
              Set username to use for proxy authentication

       -p password
              Set password to use for proxy authentication

       --password-prompt
              Prompt for proxy username and password

       --http-1.0
              Use HTTP/1.0 instead of HTTP/1.1 for HTTP connections

       --telnet-keep-alive interval
              Causes prtunnel to send keep-alive data at the specified
              interval, using the telnet NOP command

       --crlf-keep-alive interval
              Causes prtunnel to send keep-alive data at the specified
              interval, using a CRLF (this works for some text-based
              protocols)

       --irc-auto-pong
              Causes prtunnel to automatically respond to PING commands sent
              by IRC servers.

       --timeout time
              Allows you to set a client socket timeout; if no data is
              recieved from the client for <time> seconds, the connection will
              be closed

       --server-timeout time
              Allows you to set a server socket timeout; if no data is
              recieved from the remote host for <time> seconds, the connection
              will be closed

       -h, --help
              Show help message

       -v, --version
              Show version information

EXAMPLE
       prtunnel -H proxy 6667 irc.freenode.net 6667

       After starting prtunnel like this, you could then point an IRC client
       to 127.0.0.1, and prtunnel will attempt to connect you to
       irc.freenode.net via the HTTP proxy server on a system named "proxy".
