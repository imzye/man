HTTP::HeaderParser::XS(3)                  User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       HTTP::HeaderParser::XS - an XS extension for processing HTTP headers.

SYNOPSIS
         use HTTP::HeaderParser::XS;

         my $hdr = HTTP::HeaderParser::XS->new( \"GET / HTTP/1.0\r\nConnection: keep-alive\r\nHost: www.bar.com\r\n\r\n" );

         if ( $hdr->isResponse ) {
           # this is not a response in this simple demo, but it could be
           print "Response code: " . $hdr->getStatusCode . "\n";
           print "Connection header: " . $hdr->getHeader( 'Connection' ) . "\n";

         } else {
           # see if it's a GET request
           if ( $hdr->getMethod == M_GET ) {
             print "GET: " . $hdr->getURI() . "\n";

             # now let's rewrite the host header and rewrite the header :-)
             print "Host header was: " . $hdr->getHeader( 'Host' ) . "\n";
             $hdr->setHeader( 'Host', 'www.foo.com' );

             # show new headers, now that we changed something
             print "New headers:\n";
             print $hdr->getReconstructed . "\n";

           } else {
             print "Not a GET request!\n";
           }
         }

DESCRIPTION
       This module parses HTTP headers using a C++ state machine.  (Hence this
       being an XS module.)  The goal is to be fast, not necessarily to do
       everything you could ever want.

       Headers are not static, you can parse them, munge them, or even build
       them using this module.  See the SYNOPSIS for more information on how
       to use this module.

KNOWN BUGS
       There are no known bugs at this time.  Please report any you find!
