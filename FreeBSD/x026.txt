NAME
       x026 - IBM keypunch emulator

SYNOPSIS
       x026

DESCRIPTION
       x026 is a simulation of an IBM 026 keypunch.

       It allows input from the keyboard or by pasting the X11 selection with
       the middle mouse button.  Keyboard input is deliberately paced so that
       typing occurs at a realistically slow pace.  This can be overridden
       with a command-line option.  If the selected character set does not
       support lower-case characters, they will be mapped to upper-case
       characters.  If the selected character set does not support a
       particular character at all, it will be ignored.

       Multiple punches in a single column can be entered by holding down the
       Alt key.

       The current card can be moved left and right with the left and right
       cursor keys, and back to column 1 with the Home key.  There is one
       configured tab stop, which is set up to skip to the body of a FORTRAN
       statement.

       The current card is stored, and the next card fed in, with the Return
       key.

       There is a button to discard the current card; it will be replaced with
       a blank card with the same sequence number as the discarded card.

       The virtual card deck can be saved in one of two ways.  The Save Ascii
       option saves the deck as ASCII (actually ISO 8859-1) text, with multi-
       punch columns implemented as backspaces.  The Save Images option saves
       the deck in Douglas Jones's standard card deck format (see
       http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/cards/index.html for details).

OPTIONS
       x026 is a toolkit-based program, so it understands standard Xt options
       and resources (e.g., -geom).  It also understands the following
       options:

       -ifont font
              Interpreter (card edge) font.  Defaults to 7x13.

       -nonumber
              Do not automatically number the cards in columns 73 through 80.

       -typeahead
              Allow typeahead.  This is very un-026-like.

       -charset name
              Keypunch character set:

                               bcd-h    026 FORTRAN (default)
                               bcd-a    026 commercial
                                029     029 standard
                                1401    IBM 1401
                               ebcdic   S/360 EBCDIC

       -card name
              Card image:

                            collins   Collins Radio Corporation
                              cmu     Carnegie Mellon University

       -026ftn
              Alias for -charset bcd-h.

       -026comm
              Alias for -charset bcd-a.

       -029   Alias for -charset 029.

       -EBCDIC
              Alias for -charset ebcdic.

       -help  Display command-line syntax help.

BUGS
       The author obviously has very little experience with real keypunches,
       and would appreciate any input on how to make x026 a more realistic
       experience.

       Sound effects would be an obvious addition, but are notoriously non-
       portable.
