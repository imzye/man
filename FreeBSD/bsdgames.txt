NAME
     adventure – an exploration game

SYNOPSIS
     adventure [saved-file]

DESCRIPTION
     The object of the game is to locate and explore Colossal Cave, find the
     treasures hidden there, and bring them back to the building with you.
     The program is self-descriptive to a point, but part of the game is to
     discover its rules.

     To terminate a game, enter “quit”; to save a game for later resumption,
     enter “suspend”.
