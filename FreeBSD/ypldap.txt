NAME
     ypldap – YP map server using LDAP backend

SYNOPSIS
     ypldap [-dnv] [-D macro=value] [-f file]

DESCRIPTION
     ypldap is a daemon providing YP maps using LDAP as a backend.  RFC 2307
     or similar LDAP schemas can be tied to the different YP maps.  ypldap has
     the same role as ypserv(8) and the two daemons are exclusive.

     The options are as follows:

     -D macro=value
             Define macro to be set to value on the command line.  Overrides
             the definition of macro in the configuration file.

     -d      Do not daemonize.  If this option is specified, ypldap will run
             in the foreground and log to stderr.

     -f file
             Specify an alternative configuration file.

     -n      Configtest mode.  Only check the configuration file for validity.

     -v      Produce more verbose output.

FILES
     /etc/ypldap.conf    Default ypldap configuration file.
