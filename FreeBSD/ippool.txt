DESCRIPTION
       Ippool is used to manage information stored in the IP pools subsystem
       of IPFilter.  Configuration file information may be parsed and loaded
       into the kernel, currently configured pools removed or changed as well
       as inspected.

       The command line options used are broken into two sections: the global
       options and the instance specific options.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       -d     Toggle debugging of processing the configuration file.

       -n     This flag (no-change) prevents ippool from actually making any
              ioctl calls or doing anything which would alter the currently
              running kernel.

       -v     Turn verbose mode on.

COMMAND OPTIONS
       -a     Add a new data node to an existing pool in the kernel.

       -A     Add a new (empty) pool to the kernel.

       -f <file>
              Read in IP pool configuration information from the file and load
              it into the kernel.

       -F     Flush loaded pools from the kernel.

       -l     Display a list of pools currently loaded into the kernel.

       -r     Remove an existing data node from a pool in the kernel.

       -R     Remove an existing pool from within the kernel.

       -s     Display IP pool statistical information.

OPTIONS
       -i <ipaddr>[/<netmask>]
              Sets the IP address for the operation being undertaken with an
              all-one's mask or, optionally, a specific netmask given in
              either the dotted-quad notation or a single integer.

       -m <name>
              Sets the pool name for the current operation.

       -M <core>
              Specify an alternative path to /dev/kmem to retrieve statistical
              information from.

       -N <namelist>
              Specify an alternative path to lookup symbol name information
              from when retrieving statistical information.

       -o <role>
              Sets the role with which this pool is to be used.  Currently
              only ipf (the default) is accepted as arguments to this option.

       -S <seed>
              Sets the hashing seed to the number specified.  Only for use
              with hash type pools.

       -t <type>
              Sets the type of pool being defined.  Must be one of tree, hash,
              group-map.

       -T <ttl>
              Sets the expiration of the node being added. The timeout is
              expressed as a number of seconds.  tree, hash, group-map.

       -u     When parsing a configuration file, rather than load new pool
              data into the kernel, unload it.

FILES
       /dev/iplookup
       /etc/ippool.conf
