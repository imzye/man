NAME
       irchailo-seed - Creates a Hailo training file from logs generated by
       POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::Logger or irssi.

SYNOPSIS
       irchailo-seed <options>

        Options:
          -f FORMAT, --format=NAME         Log format (pocoirc or irssi)
          -c CASE,   --case=CASE           The IRC server's case mapping
          -b NICK,   --bot=NICK            The nickname of the IRC bot
          -r RX      --ignore-regex=RX     A regex for lines to ignore
          -n NICK,   --ignore-nick=NICK    A nickname to ignore
          -h,        --help                Print this help message
          -v,        --version             Print version number

       Input is accepted on STDIN, and output is delivered to STDOUT.

       You should use the "--bot" option if your bot was present when the
       channel was logged as it will strip the "botname: " part from messages
       where users addressed the bot.

       If your bot (or any other bot in the channel) can take commands that
       all start in a similar way, use the "--ignore-regex" option to ignore
       those lines, e.g. "--ignore-regex='^!\w+'" for bots that react to
       commands prefixed with '!'.

       Example:

         # convert irssi log, ignoring "MyBot: " prefix and lines with URLs
         cat ~/logs/\#chan.log | irchailo-seed -f irssi -b MyBot -r '\w+://\w' > hailo.trn

       The "--case" option controls the second parameter passed to "lc_irc"
       from IRC::Utils. The default is 'rfc1459'. You usually don't have to
       change this. Consult that package's documentation for more information.
