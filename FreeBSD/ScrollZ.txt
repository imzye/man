NAME
       ScrollZ - An advanced ircII-based IRC client

SYNOPSIS
       scrollz [-4] [-6] [-c chan] [-p portno] [-f] [-F] [-h host] [-H host]
       [-C name] [-s] [-S] [-n] [-d] [-q] [-a] [-b] [-l file] [-I file] [-L
       file] [nickname] [serverlist]

DESCRIPTION
       ScrollZ is advanced IRC client based on ircII code. It adds features
       normally found in ircII scripts.

       The main difference between these scripts and ScrollZ is the code.
       Where ircII scripts take a lot of disk and memory space and run slow,
       ScrollZ only takes a couple of extra kilobytes compared to stock ircII
       client yet runs faster than any ircII script. This was accomplished by
       using C code instead of ircII scripting language. This reduces memory
       and CPU usage and code tends to run faster.  ScrollZ includes features
       such as built-in userlist, shitlist, improved scripting, Blowfish based
       encryption, features for IRC operators and user friendly features such
       as completion for nicks and channels.
