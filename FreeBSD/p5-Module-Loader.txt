NAME
       Module::Loader - finding and loading modules in a given namespace

SYNOPSIS
        use Module::Loader;

        my $loader  = Module::Loader->new;
        my @plugins = $loader->find_modules('MyApp::Plugin');

        foreach my $plugin (@plugins) {
           $loader->load($plugin);
        }

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides methods for finding modules in a given namespace,
       and then loading them. It is intended for use in situations where
       you're looking for plugins, and then loading one or more of them.

       This module was inspired by Mojo::Loader, which I have used in a number
       of projects. But some people were wary of requiring Mojolicious just to
       get a module loader, which prompted me to create "Module::Loader".

       Note: this module was initially called "Plugin::Loader", but I realised
       that "Module::Loader" was a more appropriate name.

   new
       When instantiating "Module::Loader", you can optionally set the
       "max_depth" attribute, which limits the search depth when looking for
       modules.

        my $loader  = Module::Loader->new(max_depth => 1);

       Let's say you have all of the CPAN plugins for the template toolkit
       installed locally. If you don't specify "max_depth", then
       find_modules('Template::Plugin') would return
       Template::Plugin::Filter::Minify::JavaScript as well as
       Template::Plugin::File. If you set "max_depth" to 1, then you'd get the
       latter but not the former.

       Why might you want to do that?

       You might have a convention where plugins are the modules immediately
       within the specified namespace, but that each plugin can have
       additional modules within its own namespace.

       So typically you'll either not set "max_depth", or you'll set it to 1.

METHODS
   find_modules
       Takes a namespace, and returns all installed modules in that namespace,
       that were found in @INC. For example:

        @plugins = $loader->find_modules('Template::Plugin');

       By default this will find all modules in the given namespace, unless
       you've specified a maximum search depth, as described above.  You can
       also specify "max_depth" when you call the method:

        @plugins = $loader->find_modules('Template::Plugin',
                                         { max_depth => 1 });

   search
       This is the same as find_modules() above, but it hard-codes the search
       depth to 1.  This method is provided for compatibility with
       Mojo::Loader:

        @plugins = $loader->search('Template::Plugin');

       It just calls find_modules() with "max_depth" set to 1, as shown above.

   load
       Takes a module name and tries to load the module.

        $loader->load('MyModule::Plugin::Spank');

       If loading fails, then we "croak".

   max_depth
       Returns the value of the "max_depth", if it was passed to the
       constructor, otherwise "undef".

SEE ALSO
       Mojo::Loader was the inspiration for this module, but has a slightly
       different interface. In particular, it has "max_depth" hard-coded to 1.

       Module::Pluggable is effectively a role which gives a class the ability
       to find plugins within its namespace.

       Module::Pluggable::Ordered is similar to Module::Pluggable, but lets
       you control the order in which modules are loaded.

       all will load all modules in a given namespace, eg with "use all
       'IO::*';"

       lib::require::all will load all modules found in a given directory (as
       opposed to a namespace).

       MAD::Loader provides functions for loading modules, but not for finding
       them.

       Module::Find provides a number of functions for finding and loading
       modules. It provides different functions depending on whether you want
       to limit the search depth to 1 or not: "findallmod" vs "findsubmod".

       Module::Recursive::Require will load all modules in a given namespace,
       and return a list of the modules found / loaded.  It lets you provide
       regexps for filtering out certain namespaces.

       Module::Require provides two functions, "require_regex" and
       "require_glob" which will load all locally installed modules whose name
       matches a pattern (specified as a regular expression or glob-style
       pattern).
