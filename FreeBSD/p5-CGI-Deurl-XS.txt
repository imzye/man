NAME
       CGI::Deurl::XS - Fast decoder for URL parameter strings

SYNOPSIS
         use CGI::Deurl::XS 'parse_query_string';

         my $hash = parse_query_string('foo=bar&baz=quux&baz=qiix');
         # $hash = { 'foo' => 'bar', 'baz' => ['quux', 'qiix'] };

DESCRIPTION
       This module decodes a URL-encoded parameter string in the manner of
       CGI.pm.  However, as it uses C code from libapreq to perform the task,
       it's somewhere from slightly to much faster (depending on your strings)
       than using CGI or a functionally similar module like CGI::Deurl.

FUNCTIONS
       parse_query_string()
             $hash_ref = CGI::Deurl::XS::parse_query_string($query_string)

           Parses the given query string. If the string is empty, returns
           undef. Otherwise returns a hash reference containing the key/value
           pairs encoded by the string.  Empty values are returned as undef.
           If a parameter appears only once, it's value in the hash is the
           scalar value of the encoded parameter value. If a parameter appears
           more than once, the hash value is an array reference containing
           each value given (with value order preserved). Obviously, parameter
           order is not preserved in the hash.

           HTTP escapes (ASCII and Unicode) are decoded in both keys and
           values. The utf8 flag is not set on returned strings, nor are
           non-utf8 encodings decoded.

EXPORT
       None by default, parse_query_string at request.
