NAME
       Plucene::Simple - An interface to Plucene

SYNOPSIS
               use Plucene::Simple;

               # create an index
               my $plucy = Plucene::Simple->open($index_path);

               # add to the index
               $plucy->add(
                       $id1 => { $field => $term1 },
                       $id2 => { $field => $term2 },
               );

               # or ...
               $plucy->index_document($id => $data);

               # search an existing index
               my $plucy = Plucene::Simple->open($index_path);
               my @results = $plucy->search($search_string);

               # optimize the index
               $plucy->optimize;

               # remove something from the index
               $plucy->delete_document($id);

               # is something in the index?
               if ($plucy->indexed($id) { ... }

DESCRIPTION
       This provides a simple interface to Plucene. Plucene is large and
       multi-featured, and it expected that users will subclass it, and tie
       all the pieces together to suit their own needs. Plucene::Simple is,
       therefore, just one way to use Plucene. It's not expected that it will
       do exactly what *you* want, but you can always use it as an example of
       how to build your own interface.

INDEXING
   open
       You make a new Plucene::Simple object like so:

               my $plucy = Plucene::Simple->open($index_path);

       If this index doesn't exist, then it will be created for you, otherwise
       you will be adding to an exisiting one.

       Then you can add your documents to the index:

   add
       Every document must be indexed with a unique key (which will be
       returned from searches).

       A document can be made up of many fields, which can be added as a
       hashref:

               $plucy->add($key, \%data);

               $plucy->add(
                       chap1  => {
                               title => "Moby-Dick",
                               author => "Herman Melville",
                               text => "Call me Ishmael ..."
                       },
                       chap2  => {
                               title => "Boo-Hoo",
                               author => "Lydia Lee",
                               text => "...",
                       }
               );

   index_document
       Alternatively, if you do not want to index lots of metadata, but rather
       just simple text, you can use the index_document() method.

               $plucy->index_document($key, $data);
               $plucy->index_document(chap1 => 'Call me Ishmael ...');

   delete_document
               $plucy->delete_document($id);

   optimize
               $plucy->optimize;

       Plucene is set-up to perform insertions quickly. After a bunch of
       inserts it is good to optimize() the index for better search speed.

SEARCHING
   search
               my @ids = $plucy->search('ishmael');
                 # ("chap1", ...)

       This will return the IDs of each document matching the search term.

       If you have indexed your documents with fields, you can also search
       with the field name as a prefix:

               my @ids = $plucy->search("author:lee");
                       # ("chap2" ...)

               my @results = $plucy->search($search_string);

       This will search the index with the given query, and return a list of
       document ids.

       Searches can be much more powerful than this - see Plucene for further
       details.

   search_during
               my @results = $lucy->search_during($search_string, $date1, $date2);
               my @results = $lucy->search_during("to:Fred", "2001-01-01" => "2003-12-31");

       If your documents were given an ISO 'date' field when indexing,
       search_during() will restrict the results to all documents between the
       specified dates. Any document without a 'date' field will be ignored.

   indexed
               if ($plucy->indexed($id) { ... }

       This returns true if there is a document with the given ID in the
       index.
