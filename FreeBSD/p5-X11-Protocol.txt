NAME
       X11::Auth - Perl module to read X11 authority files

SYNOPSIS
         require X11::Auth;
         $a = new X11::Auth;
         ($auth_type, $auth_data) = $a->get_by_host($host, $disp_num);

DESCRIPTION
       This module is an approximate perl replacement for the libXau C library
       and the xauth(1) program. It reads and interprets the files (usually
       '~/.Xauthority') that hold authorization data used in connecting to X
       servers. Since it was written mainly for the use of X11::Protocol, its
       functionality is currently restricted to reading, not writing, of these
       files.

METHODS
   new
         $auth = X11::Auth->new;
         $auth = X11::Auth->open($filename);

       Open an authority file, and create an object to handle it. The filename
       will be taken from the XAUTHORITY environment variable, if present, or
       '.Xauthority' in the user's home directory, or it may be overridden by
       an argument. 'open' may be used as a synonym.

   get_one
         ($family, $host_addr, $display_num, $auth_name, $auth_data)
            = $auth->get_one;

       Read one entry from the file. Returns a null list at end of file.
       $family is usually 'Internet' or 'Local', and $display_num can be any
       string.

   get_all
         @auth_data = $auth->get_all;

       Read all of the entries in the file. Each member of the array returned
       is an array ref similar to the list returned by get_one().

   get_by_host
         ($auth_name, $auth_data)
            = $auth->get_by_host($host, $family, $display_num);

       Get authentication data for a connection of type $family to display
       $display_num on $host. If $family is 'Internet', the host will be
       translated into an appropriate address by gethostbyname(). If no data
       is found, returns an empty list.

COMPATIBILITY
       The following table shows the (rough) correspondence between libXau
       calls and X11::Auth methods:

         libXau                     X11::Auth
         ------                     ---------
         XauFileName                $ENV{XAUTHORITY}
                                    || "$ENV{HOME}/.Xauthority"
         fopen(XauFileName(), "rb") $auth = new X11::Auth
         XauReadAuth                $auth->get_one
         XauWriteAuth
         XauGetAuthByAddr           $auth->get_by_host
         XauGetBestAuthByAddr
         XauLockAuth
         XauUnlockAuth
         XauDisposeAuth
