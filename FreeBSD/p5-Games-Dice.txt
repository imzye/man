NAME
       roll - Command line interface for dice rolls

VERSION
       version 0.046

SYNOPSIS
           # Evaluate these command line params
           roll 3d6 2d8

           echo "5d6" > f
           echo "2d4+1" >> f

           # Read the contents of 'f' from STDIN
           roll < f

           # Evaluate 1d100 and open file 'f'
           roll d% f

OVERVIEW
       This is a command line interface to the Games::Dice library. It takes
       die rolling specifications in the form of adb[+-*/b]c.

       (This specification may change a bit over time, but not radically.)

       •   a is optional and defaults to 1; this is number of dice to roll.

       •   b is the number of sides on each die. '%' is shorthand for 100.

       The optional end modifies the sum of the rolls. 'b' means take the
       "best" c rolls and sum them. Also '/' truncates the result to an
       integer after division.

       Dice specifications can be piped in, given on STDIN or as positional
       parameters from the command line.

       If a positional parameter matches a file name, it will be opened and
       each line of the file evaluated.

PERL VERSION
       This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates
       from the Perl 5 Porters.  This means it should work on any version of
       perl released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the most
       recently released version is v5.40, then this module should work on
       both v5.40 and v5.38.)

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made
       that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version
       may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.
