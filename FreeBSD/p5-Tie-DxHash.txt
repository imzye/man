NAME
       Tie::DxHash - keeps insertion order; allows duplicate keys

VERSION
       This document describes Tie::DxHash version 1.03

SYNOPSIS
           use Tie::DxHash;
           my(%vhost);
           tie %vhost, 'Tie::DxHash' [, LIST];
           %vhost = (
               ServerName  => 'foo',
               RewriteCond => 'bar',
               RewriteRule => 'bletch',
               RewriteCond => 'phooey',
               RewriteRule => 'squelch',
           );

DESCRIPTION
       This  module was  written to     allow the  use of    rewrite  rules in
       Apache configuration  files written with Perl Sections.   However, a
       potential user has stated that he  needs it to support  the use of
       multiple ScriptAlias directives within a single Virtual Host  (which is
       required by  FrontPage, apparently).  If you find a completely
       different use for it, great.

       The original purpose of this  module is not quite  so obscure as it
       might sound.  Perl Sections   bring the power   of a general-purpose
       programming  language to Apache configuration files and,  having  used
       them  once,  many people use  them throughout.  (I take this approach
       since, even  in sections of the configuration where  I do  not need
       the  flexibility, I find  it  easier to use  a consistent syntax.  This
       also makes the code easier for XEmacs to  colour in ;-) Similarly,
       mod_rewrite is easily the most powerful way to  perform URL rewriting
       and I tend to use it  exclusively, even when a  simpler directive
       would  do the  trick, in order to group my redirections together and
       keep them consistent.  So, I came up against the following problem
       quite early on.

       The synopsis  shows  some syntax which  might  be needed when using
       mod_rewrite within a  Perl Section.  Clearly,  using an ordinary hash
       will   not do what you want.  The two additional features we  need are
       to  preserve insertion order and to allow  duplicate keys.   When
       retrieving an  element from  the hash by  name, successive requests for
       the same name must iterate through the duplicate entries (and,
       presumably, wrap around when  the end of  the chain is reached).  This
       is where Tie::DxHash  comes   in.   Simply  by  tying   the  offending
       hash,  the corresponding configuration directives work as expected.

       Running an Apache syntax  check (with docroot check)  on your
       configuration file (with "httpd -t") and checking virtual host settings
       (with "httpd -S") succeed without complaint.   Incidentally,  I
       strongly recommend building   your Apache configuration files with make
       (or equivalent) in  order to enforce the above two checks, preceded by
       a Perl syntax check (with "perl -cx").

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
       This module   is  intended to be   called  through Perl's   tie
       interface.  For reference, the following methods have been defined:

           CLEAR
           DELETE
           EXISTS
           FETCH
           FIRSTKEY
           NEXTKEY
           SCALAR
           STORE
           TIEHASH

DIAGNOSTICS
       None.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
       Tie::DxHash requires no configuration files or environment variables.

DEPENDENCIES
       None.

INCOMPATIBILITIES
       None reported.

INTERNALS
       For those interested, Tie::DxHash works by storing the  hash data in an
       array of hash references  (containing  the key/value  pairs).  This
       preserves  insertion order.  A separate set  of iterators (one per
       distinct key) keeps track of  the last retrieved value for a given key,
       thus  allowing the successive retrieval of multiple values for the same
       key to work as expected.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       The algorithms used to retrieve and delete elements by  key run in O(N)
       time, so do not expect  this  module to work well   on large data
       sets.   This is not  a problem for the module's intended  use.  If you
       find  another use for the module which involves larger quantities of
       data, let me know and I will put some effort into optimising for speed.

       The  mod_rewrite  directives for  which   this module  was   written
       (primarily RewriteCond and RewriteRule) can  occur in all  four
       configuration file contexts (i.e. server config,  virtual host,
       directory, .htaccess).  However, Tie::DxHash only helps when  you are
       using  a directive which  is mapped  onto a  Perl hash.  This limits
       you to  directives which are block  sections with begin and end tags
       (like  <VirtualHost>  and  <Directory>).   I  get  round  this  by
       sticking my mod_rewrite directives in  a name-based virtual host
       container  (as shown in the synopsis) even in the degenerate case where
       the  web server only has one virtual host.
