NAME
       hydra_nameserver -  program to support MPI s name publishing features
       with hydra

DESCRIPTION
       Hydra is the default name service for MPI\ s name publishing features
       (MPI_PUBLISH_NAME/MPI_LOOKUP_NAME). For programs launched by separate
       hydra instances, a separate nameserver mechanism need be launched in
       order for the name publishing to work across multiple process managers.

       This can be achieved with hydra_nameserver. For example:
       shell@myhost1$ hydra_nameserver &
       shell@myhost1$ mpiexec -hosts myhost1,myhost2 -n 4 -nameserver myhost1 ./a.out
