KILLALL(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             KILLALL(1)

NAME
     killall – kill processes by name

SYNOPSIS
     killall [-delmsvz] [-help] [-I] [-j jail] [-u user] [-t tty]
             [-c procname] [-SIGNAL] [procname ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The killall utility kills processes selected by name, as opposed to the
     selection by PID as done by kill(1).  By default, it will send a TERM
     signal to all processes with a real UID identical to the caller of
     killall that match the name procname.  The super-user is allowed to kill
     any process.

     The options are as follows:

     -d | -v            Be more verbose about what will be done.  For a single
                        -d option, a list of the processes that will be sent
                        the signal will be printed, or a message indicating
                        that no matching processes have been found.

     -e                 Use the effective user ID instead of the (default)
                        real user ID for matching processes specified with the
                        -u option.

     -help              Give a help on the command usage and exit.

     -I                 Request confirmation before attempting to signal each
                        process.

     -l                 List the names of the available signals and exit, like
                        in kill(1).

     -m                 Match the argument procname as a (case sensitive)
                        regular expression against the names of processes
                        found.  CAUTION!  This is dangerous, a single dot will
                        match any process running under the real UID of the
                        caller.

     -s                 Show only what would be done, but do not send any
                        signal.

     -SIGNAL            Send a different signal instead of the default TERM.
                        The signal may be specified either as a name (with or
                        without a leading “SIG”), or numerically.

     -j jail            Kill processes in the specified jail.

     -u user            Limit potentially matching processes to those
                        belonging to the specified user.

     -t tty             Limit potentially matching processes to those running
                        on the specified tty.

     -c procname        Limit potentially matching processes to those matching
                        the specified procname.

     -q                 Suppress error message if no processes are matched.

     -z                 Do not skip zombies.  This should not have any effect
                        except to print a few error messages if there are
                        zombie processes that match the specified pattern.

ALL PROCESSES
     Sending a signal to all processes with the given UID is already supported
     by kill(1).  So use kill(1) for this job (e.g. “kill -TERM -1” or as root
     “echo kill -TERM -1 | su -m <user>”).

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
     This FreeBSD implementation of killall has completely different semantics
     as compared to the traditional UNIX System V behavior of killall.  The
     latter will kill all processes that the current user is able to kill, and
     is intended to be used by the system shutdown process only.

EXIT STATUS
     The killall utility exits 0 if some processes have been found and
     signalled successfully.  Otherwise, a status of 1 will be returned.

DIAGNOSTICS
     Diagnostic messages will only be printed if requested by -d options.

HISTORY
     The killall command appeared in FreeBSD 2.1.  It has been modeled after
     the killall command as available on other platforms.

AUTHORS
     The killall program was originally written in Perl and was contributed by
     Wolfram Schneider, this manual page has been written by Jörg Wunsch.  The
     current version of killall was rewritten in C by Peter Wemm using
     sysctl(3).
