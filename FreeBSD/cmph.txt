NAME
       cmph - minimum perfect hashing tool

SYNOPSIS
       cmph [-v] [-h] [-V] [-k nkeys] [-f hash_function] [-g [-c value][-s
       seed] ] [-a algorithm] [-M memory_in_MB] [-b BRZ_parameter] [-d
       tmp_dir] [-m file.mph] keysfile

DESCRIPTION
       Command line tool to generate and query minimal perfect hash functions.

       Please refer to http://cmph.sf.net for full documentation.

       -h     Print an help message

       -c     This value determines: the number of vertices in the graph for
              the algorithms BMZ and CHM; the number of bits per key required
              in the FCH algorithm

       -a     Algorithm. Valid values are: bmz, bmz8, chm, brz, fch

       -f     hash function (may be used multiple times). valid values are:
              djb2, fnv, jenkins, sdbm

       -V     Print version number and exit

       -v     Increase verbosity (may be used multiple times)

       -k     Number of keys

       -g     Generation mode

       -s     Random seed

       -m     Minimum perfect hash function file

       -M     Main memory availability (in MB)

       -d     Temporary directory used in brz algorithm

       -b     Parameter of BRZ algorithm to make the maximal number of keys in
              a bucket lower than 256

       keysfile
              Line separated file with keys

EXAMPLE
       $ # Using the default algorithm (chm) for constructing a mphf
       $ # for keys in file keys_file. Lines in keys_file _must_ be unique.
       $ ./cmph -v -g keys_file
       $ # Query id of keys in the file keys_query
       $ ./cmph -v -m keys_file.mph keys_query
