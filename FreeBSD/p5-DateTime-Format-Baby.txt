DateTime::Format::Baby(3)                  User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       DateTime::Format::Baby - Parse and format baby-style time

SYNOPSIS
         use DateTime::Format::Baby;

         my $Baby = DateTime::Format::Baby->new('en');
         my $dt = $Baby->parse_datetime('The big hand is on the twelve and the little hand is on the six.');

         $Baby->language('fr');

         print $Baby->format_datetime($dt);
         # -> La grande aiguille est sur le douze et la petite aiguille est sur le six

       Extended example, with a fancy clockface (seen in
       Acme::Time::Asparagus).

         use DateTime::Format::Baby;
         my $baby = DateTime::Format::Baby->new(language => 'en',
                                                numbers  => [
                        'Tomato',      'Eggplant',        'Carrot',     'Garlic',
                        'Green Onion', 'Pumpkin',         'Asparagus',  'Onion',
                        'Corn',        'Brussels Sprout', 'Red Pepper', 'Cabbage',
                        ]
                     );
         my $dt = DateTime->new(year => 1964, month  => 10, day    => 16,
                                hour =>   17, minute => 36, second =>  0
                  );

         print $baby->format_datetime($dt);
         # -> The big hand is on the Asparagus and the little hand is on the Pumpkin

DESCRIPTION
       This module understands baby talk in a variety of languages.

METHODS
       This class offers the following methods.

       •   new($language) or new(%hash)

           As usual, this class method returns an instance of the class.

           The method can receive either a single parameter specifying the
           language, or a hash with various parameters (note: not a hash
           reference, a real hash, in other words a list with an even number
           of elements). The hash may contain the following keys:

           •   language

               Two-char code of a language (ISO 639-1) or special cases
               "Swedish chef" and "warez".

           •   numbers

               Array reference containing the twelve numbers on the clockface.
               Number "1" is in position 0, number "2" is in position 1, until
               number "12" which is in position 11.

           •   format

               The skeleton of the output baby-talk sentence, with %s to mark
               where the values for the big hand and the little hand will be
               inserted.

           •   big

               The various names for the big hand, in an array reference. The
               position within the array does not matter.

           •   little

               Same thing for the little hand.

       •   parse_datetime($string)

           Given baby talk, this method will return a new "DateTime" object.

           For some languages (en, de, es, fr and it) parsing uses a regexp on
           various synonyms for 'big' and 'little'. For all other languages,
           the module only understands the same phrase that it would give
           using format_datetime().

           If given baby talk that it can't parse, this method may either die
           or get confused.  Don't try things like "The big and little hands
           are on the six and five, respectively."

       •   format_datetime($datetime)

           Given a "DateTime" object, this methods returns baby talk. Remember
           though that babies only understand time (even then, without am/pm)

       •   language($language)

           When given a language, this method sets its language appropriately.

           This method returns the current language. (After processing as
           above)

       •   languages()

           This method return a list of known languages.

KNOWN ISSUES AND BUGS
       No known bug, only known issues.

       As Abigail said in his module Acme::Time::Baby, the "Baby" part of the
       module name is a misnomer, because you have to be at least a toddler to
       read a clockface and describe it in a complete sentence with a correct
       syntax (even if a simple one). On the other hand, the common phrase is
       not "toddler talk", but "baby talk". Therefore Acme::Time::Baby keeps
       its name Acme::Time::Baby and DateTime::Format::Baby keeps its name
       DateTime::Format::Baby.

       Baby talk does not implement years, months, days or even AM/PM. It's
       more for amusement than anything else.

       You may think that a roundtrip like this:

         my $string       = $baby->format_datetime($datetime);
         my $new_datetime = $baby->parse_datetime($string);

       should give the same value with a 5-minute fuzz factor.  This is not
       the case for two reasons. As stated above, babies (or toddlers) do not
       understand the AM/PM factor. So there can be a 12-hour skip in the
       roundtrip. The second reason is that when the time is a few minutes
       past the half-hour (say xx:31 or xx:32), the small hand is not on the
       same number as when the time is exactly on the half-hour. So there is a
       1-hour jump forward during such a round-trip.

       As already said above, baby talk does not include convoluted sentences
       as: "The big and little hands are on the six and five, respectively" or
       "Both hands are on the five".
