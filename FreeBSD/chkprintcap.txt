CHKPRINTCAP(8)          FreeBSD System Manager's Manual         CHKPRINTCAP(8)

NAME
     chkprintcap – check validity of entries in the print spooler database

SYNOPSIS
     chkprintcap [-d] [-f printcap]

DESCRIPTION
     The chkprintcap utility scans a printcap(5) database (named by the
     printcap argument, or by default /etc/printcap), looking for entries
     which are invalid in one way or another.  The following checks are
     currently implemented:

           1.   ‘tc=’ references were properly expanded

           2.   ‘tc=’ references did not form a loop

           3.   No two printers share the same spool directory (‘sd=’
                capability).

     The chkprintcap utility exits with a status equal to the number of errors
     encountered before processing stopped.  (In some cases, processing can
     stop before the entire file is scanned.)

     If the -d flag is given, chkprintcap will attempt to create any missing
     spool directories, giving them ‘u=rwx,go=rx’ (0755) mode, group ‘daemon’,
     and the owner specified by the ‘du=’ capability in the database (default
     1, which corresponds to user ‘daemon’).

AUTHORS
     The chkprintcap utility was written by Garrett A. Wollman
     <wollman@lcs.mit.edu>.

BUGS
     Not enough sanity-checking is done.  At a minimum, the ownership and mode
     of the spool directories should also be checked.  Other parameters whose
     value could cause lpd(8) to fail should be diagnosed.
