NAME
       SWF::Chart - Perl interface to the SWF Chart generation tool

SYNOPSIS
         use SWF::Chart;

         my $g = SWF::Chart->new;

         $g->set_titles(qw(Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec));

         # Add a single data set
         $g->add_dataset(1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6);

         # Add multiple datasets
         $g->add_dataset([qw(1 3 5 7 11 13 17 23 29 31 37 41)],
                         [qw(1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144)]);

         # Add multiple datasets with labels
         $g->add_dataset('Label 1' => \@set1,
                         'Label 2' => \@set2);

         $g->text_properties(bold  => 0,
                             size  => 10,
                             color => '333333');

         $g->chart_rect(positive_color => '555555',
                        positive_alpha => 100);

         $g->series_color('DEADBE');

         print $g->xml;

DESCRIPTION
       This module is the Perl interface to the SWF Charts flash graphing
       tool.  It constructs the XML file this flash movie requires via an OO
       interface.  Each configurable option that is listed on the SWF Charts
       reference page has a companion method in this module.  See:

         http://www.maani.us/charts/index.php?menu=Reference

       When using this module, please be sure to use the latest version of the
       XML/SWF Charts flash movie.  Earlier versions of that flash movie
       supported a different XML structure for which this module is not
       backward compatible.

       Note that there are a few extra helper functions that this module
       provides:

       chart_data (set_titles/add_dataset)
           The 'chart_data' option has been split into two different methods,
           'set_titles' and 'add_dataset'.  The original 'chart_data' option
           held all of this information, but from an interface standpoint, it
           makes more sense to separate these.

       text_properties
           This method sets the 'font', 'bold', 'size' and 'color' properties
           of all options that effect text ('axis_category', 'axis_value',
           'chart_value', 'legend_label' and 'draw_text').  See
           "text_properties" for more information.

       hide_legend
           This method employes a hack to hide the legend of a graph since
           this option does not currently exist in SWF Chart.

MODULE SPECIFIC METHODS
       The following methods do not have a direct analog to any SWF Chart
       option.

           $g = SWF::Chart->new

           Creates a new SWF Chart object.  Does not take any parameters.

           $g->set_titles

           Sets the titles for each column of data.  There should be as many
           titles as data points you pass to 'add_dataset'. If this method is
           called multiple times, only the last set of titles given will be
           used.

           $g->add_dataset(@row);

           $g->add_dataset(\@row1, \@row2, \@row3)

           $g->add_dataset('Region A' => \@row1,
                                 'Region B' => \@row2)

           Adds rows of data to be charted.  Accepts a list of values for a
           single row, a list of array references for multiple rows or a hash
           where the key is the row label and the value is an array reference
           of values for that row.  If this method is called more than once,
           each row is added after the existing rows rather than replacing
           them.

           $g->chart_value_text(@row);

           $g->chart_value_text(\@row1, \@row2, \@row3)

           Adds alternate text for the values displayed.  Accepts a list of
           values for a single row or a list of array references for multiple
           rows.  If this method is called more than once, each row's
           alternate text is added after the existing rows rather than
           replacing them.

           $g->hide_legend

           This method is a hack to allow easy hiding of the legend.  It
           achives this by setting the legend y-coordinate to -9999, placing
           it (hopefully) far off canvas.  If at some point a native
           'hide_legend' is implimented, that will be used instead.

           $g->text_properties(%param)

           This method sets text properties for all options that affect text.
           This makes it easy to sets the font for all text in a graph to be
           'Arial', or all to a particular point size.  The keys to %param are
           the properties that can be changed:

           font
               The font face to use for all text.  Arial is the default font
               and is the only one embedded in the flash movie.  If any other
               font is set here it must be installed on the clients machine or
               SWF Chart will default to the closest font.

           bold
               A boolean that determines whether the font is bold or not

           size
               The font size in points

           color
               The hex color for text

           This method acts as a convience method to set all text properties
           at once.  This means that if you call this after setting font
           properties for a specific option, those values will be overwritten.
           If you would prefer this to operate as a way to set defaults, then
           call this method first and then set the additional font
           prorperites.

SWF CHART METHODS
       The following methods have a direct relationship to the options SWF
       Charts accepts.  Please refer to the SWF Chart reference page for
       details on these options.  These methods are split into three
       categories:

   Parameter Methods
       These methods take a hash of parameters that map to the parameters
       given on the SWF Chart reference page.  If called more than once, each
       call overwrites the previous parameter values.  If a particular
       parameter is not given, then the previous value for that parameter is
       retained.  Example:

         $g->chart_border(color            => '00FF00',
                          top_thickness    => 0,
                          bottom_thickness => 0);

       The 'chart_border' option now has a border color of '00FF00' and zero
       top and bottom thickness.  After this call:

         $g->chart_border(top_thickness    => 5,
                          bottom_thickness => 5);

       The top and bottom thickness will become 5, but the color will remain
       '00FF00'.

       •   $g->axis_ticks(%param)

       •   $g->axis_value(%param)

       •   $g->chart_border(%param)

       •   $g->chart_data(%param)

       •   $g->chart_grid_h(%param)

       •   $g->chart_grid_v(%param)

       •   $g->chart_pref(%param)

       •   $g->chart_rect(%param)

       •   $g->chart_value(%param)

       •   $g->chart_value_text(%param)

       •   $g->legend_bg(%param)

       •   $g->legend_label(%param)

       •   $g->legend_rect(%param)

       •   $g->link(%param)

       •   $g->link_data(%param)

       •   $g->live_update(%param)

       •   $g->series_gap(%param)

       •   $g->series_switch(%param)

   Value Methods
       These methods take a scalar value.  If called more than once, each call
       overwrites the previous value.

       •   $g->chart_type($value)

   Repeatable Methods
       These methods can be called more than once.  Each time they are called
       they add additional data rather than replace existing data.  Currently
       there is no way to change the parameters given on previous calls.

       •   $g->draw($thing1 => $param, $thing2 => $param, ...)

           Draw one or more primitives to the chart.  Options for $thing are:

           circle
           image
           line
           rect
           text

           Valid options for the $param hash are the parameters given for the
           elements of the same name within the 'draw' command
           <http://www.maani.us/xml_charts/index.php?menu=Reference&submenu=draw>

           The only difference is when drawing 'text' you must pass the value
           for the text via a 'value' key to the $param hash.  Example:

             $g->draw(text => {bold  => 1,
                               x     => 20,
                               y     => 20,
                               value => 'The quick brown fox',
                              },
                      line => { ... },
                      ...
                     )

       •   $g->draw_circle(%param)

           Same as $g->draw(circle => \%param)

       •   $g->draw_image(%param)

           Same as $g->draw(image => \%param)

       •   $g->draw_line(%param)

           Same as $g->draw(line => \%param)

       •   $g->draw_rect(%param)

           Same as $g->draw(rect => \%param)

       •   $g->draw_text($text, %param)

           Same as $g->draw(text => \%param)

       •   $g->series_color($value)

       •   $g->series_explode($value)
