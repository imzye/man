DESCRIPTION
     The zdb utility displays information about a ZFS pool useful for
     debugging and performs some amount of consistency checking.  It is a not
     a general purpose tool and options (and facilities) may change.  This is
     neither a fsck(8) nor an fsdb(8) utility.

     The output of this command in general reflects the on-disk structure of a
     ZFS pool, and is inherently unstable.  The precise output of most
     invocations is not documented, a knowledge of ZFS internals is assumed.

     If the dataset argument does not contain any "/" or "@" characters, it is
     interpreted as a pool name.  The root dataset can be specified as pool/
     (pool name followed by a slash).

     When operating on an imported and active pool it is possible, though
     unlikely, that zdb may interpret inconsistent pool data and behave
     erratically.

OPTIONS
     Display options:

     -b      Display statistics regarding the number, size (logical, physical
             and allocated) and deduplication of blocks.

     -c      Verify the checksum of all metadata blocks while printing block
             statistics (see -b).

             If specified multiple times, verify the checksums of all blocks.

     -C      Display information about the configuration.  If specified with
             no other options, instead display information about the cache
             file (/boot/zfs/zpool.cache).  To specify the cache file to
             display, see -U.

             If specified multiple times, and a pool name is also specified
             display both the cached configuration and the on-disk
             configuration.  If specified multiple times with -e also display
             the configuration that would be used were the pool to be
             imported.

     -d      Display information about datasets.  Specified once, displays
             basic dataset information: ID, create transaction, size, and
             object count.

             If specified multiple times provides greater and greater
             verbosity.

             If object IDs are specified, display information about those
             specific objects only.

     -D      Display deduplication statistics, including the deduplication
             ratio (dedup), compression ratio (compress), inflation due to the
             zfs copies property (copies), and an overall effective ratio
             (dedup * compress / copies).

     -DD     Display a histogram of deduplication statistics, showing the
             allocated (physically present on disk) and referenced (logically
             referenced in the pool) block counts and sizes by reference
             count.

     -DDD    Display the statistics independently for each deduplication
             table.

     -DDDD   Dump the contents of the deduplication tables describing
             duplicate blocks.

     -DDDDD  Also dump the contents of the deduplication tables describing
             unique blocks.

     -E word0:word1:...:word15
             Decode and display block from an embedded block pointer specified
             by the word arguments.

     -h      Display pool history similar to zpool history, but include
             internal changes, transaction, and dataset information.

     -i      Display information about intent log (ZIL) entries relating to
             each dataset.  If specified multiple times, display counts of
             each intent log transaction type.

     -k      Examine the checkpointed state of the pool.  Note, the on disk
             format of the pool is not reverted to the checkpointed state.

     -l device
             Read the vdev labels from the specified device.  zdb -l will
             return 0 if valid label was found, 1 if error occurred, and 2 if
             no valid labels were found.

             If the -q option is also specified, don't print the labels.

             If the -u option is also specified, also display the uberblocks
             on this device.

     -L      Disable leak detection and the loading of space maps.  By
             default, zdb verifies that all non-free blocks are referenced,
             which can be very expensive.

     -m      Display the offset, spacemap, and free space of each metaslab.

     -mm     Also display information about the on-disk free space histogram
             associated with each metaslab.

     -mmm    Display the maximum contiguous free space, the in-core free space
             histogram, and the percentage of free space in each space map.

     -mmmm   Display every spacemap record.

     -M      Display the offset, spacemap, and free space of each metaslab.

     -MM     Also display information about the maximum contiguous free space
             and the percentage of free space in each space map.

     -MMM    Display every spacemap record.

     -O dataset path
             Look up the specified path inside of the dataset and display its
             metadata and indirect blocks.  Specified path must be relative to
             the root of dataset.  This option can be combined with -v for
             increasing verbosity.

     -R poolname vdev:offset:size[:flags]
             Read and display a block from the specified device.  By default
             the block is displayed as a hex dump, but see the description of
             the r flag, below.

             The block is specified in terms of a colon-separated tuple vdev
             (an integer vdev identifier) offset (the offset within the vdev)
             size (the size of the block to read) and, optionally, flags (a
             set of flags, described below).

             b offset  Print block pointer
             d         Decompress the block
             e         Byte swap the block
             g         Dump gang block header
             i         Dump indirect block
             r         Dump raw uninterpreted block data

     -s      Report statistics on zdb I/O.  Display operation counts,
             bandwidth, and error counts of I/O to the pool from zdb.

     -S      Simulate the effects of deduplication, constructing a DDT and
             then display that DDT as with -DD.

     -u      Display the current uberblock.

     Other options:

     -A      Do not abort should any assertion fail.

     -AA     Enable panic recovery, certain errors which would otherwise be
             fatal are demoted to warnings.

     -AAA    Do not abort if asserts fail and also enable panic recovery.

     -e [-p path ...]
             Operate on an exported pool, not present in
             /boot/zfs/zpool.cache.  The -p flag specifies the path under
             which devices are to be searched.

     -x dumpdir
             All blocks accessed will be copied to files in the specified
             directory.  The blocks will be placed in sparse files whose name
             is the same as that of the file or device read.  zdb can be then
             run on the generated files.  Note that the -bbc flags are
             sufficient to access (and thus copy) all metadata on the pool.

     -F      Attempt to make an unreadable pool readable by trying
             progressively older transactions.

     -G      Dump the contents of the zfs_dbgmsg buffer before exiting zdb.
             zfs_dbgmsg is a buffer used by ZFS to dump advanced debug
             information.

     -I inflight I/Os
             Limit the number of outstanding checksum I/Os to the specified
             value.  The default value is 200.  This option affects the
             performance of the -c option.

     -o var=value ...
             Set the given global libzpool variable to the provided value.
             The value must be an unsigned 32-bit integer.  Currently only
             little-endian systems are supported to avoid accidentally setting
             the high 32 bits of 64-bit variables.

     -P      Print numbers in an unscaled form more amenable to parsing, eg.
             1000000 rather than 1M.

     -t transaction
             Specify the highest transaction to use when searching for
             uberblocks.  See also the -u and -l options for a means to see
             the available uberblocks and their associated transaction
             numbers.

     -U cachefile
             Use a cache file other than /boot/zfs/zpool.cache.

     -v      Enable verbosity.  Specify multiple times for increased
             verbosity.

     -V      Attempt verbatim import.  This mimics the behavior of the kernel
             when loading a pool from a cachefile.  Only usable with -e.

     -X      Attempt "extreme" transaction rewind, that is attempt the same
             recovery as -F but read transactions otherwise deemed too old.

     Specifying a display option more than once enables verbosity for only
     that option, with more occurrences enabling more verbosity.

     If no options are specified, all information about the named pool will be
     displayed at default verbosity.
