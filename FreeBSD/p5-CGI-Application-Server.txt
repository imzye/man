CGI::Application::Server(3)                User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       CGI::Application::Server - a simple HTTP server for developing with
       CGI::Application

VERSION
       version 0.063

SYNOPSIS
         use CGI::Application::Server;
         use MyCGIApp;
         use MyCGIApp::Admin;
         use MyCGI::App::Account::Dispatch;
         use MyCGIApp::DefaultApp;

         my $server = CGI::Application::Server->new();

         # this CGI::Application object will stay persistent, might not be safe to use
         # in this way - your mileage may vary
         # http://www.mail-archive.com/cgiapp@lists.erlbaum.net/msg08997.html
         my $object = MyOtherCGIApp->new(PARAMS => { foo => 1, bar => 2 });

         $server->document_root('./htdocs');
         $server->entry_points({
             '/'          => 'MyCGIApp::DefaultApp',
             '/index.cgi' => 'MyCGIApp',
             '/admin'     => 'MyCGIApp::Admin',
             '/account'   => 'MyCGIApp::Account::Dispatch',
             '/users'     => $object,
             '/static'    => '/usr/local/htdocs',
         });
         $server->run();

DESCRIPTION
       This is a simple HTTP server for for use during development with
       CGI::Application. At this moment, it serves our needs in a very basic
       way. The plan is to release early and release often, and add features
       when we need them. That said, we welcome any and all patches, tests and
       feature requests (the ones with which are accompanied by failing tests
       will get priority).

METHODS
   new ($port)
       This acts just like "new" for HTTP::Server::Simple, except it will
       initialize instance slots that we use.

   handle_request
       This will check the request uri and dispatch appropriately, either to
       an entry point, or serve a static file (html, jpeg, gif, etc).

   entry_points (?$entry_points)
       This accepts a HASH reference in $entry_points, which maps server entry
       points (uri) to CGI::Application or CGI::Application::Dispatch class
       names or objects or to directories from which static content will be
       served by HTTP::Server::Simple::Static.  See the SYNOPSIS above for
       examples.

   is_valid_entry_point ($uri)
       This attempts to match the $uri to an entry point.

   document_root (?$document_root)
       This is the server's document root where all static files will be
       served from.

CAVEATS
       This is a subclass of HTTP::Server::Simple and all of its caveats apply
       here as well.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
       The HTTP response handling was shamelessly stolen from
       HTTP::Request::AsCGI by chansen
