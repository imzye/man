BANDWHICH
       bandwhich - display current network utilization by process, connection
       and remote IP/hostname

SYNOPSIS
       bandwhich [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       bandwhich provides a responsive terminal dashboard for displaying
       bandwidth information. It sniffs a given network interface and cross
       references it with lsof.  It is responsive to the terminal window size,
       displaying less info if there is no room for it. It will also attempt
       to resolve ips to their host name in the background using reverse DNS
       on a best effort basis.

       It has a raw mode that can be used to parse and log this data.
