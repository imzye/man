NAME
       Array::FileReader - Lazily tie files to arrays for reading

SYNOPSIS
         use Array::FileReader;
         tie @foo, Array::FileReader, "some.file";
         print $foo[30];

DESCRIPTION
       Plenty of times I've wanted to run up and down a file like this:

           @foo = <FILE>;
           for (0..100) {
               print $foo[$_];
           }
           print $foo[10], $foo[20], $foo[30];

       Of course, this is hugely inefficient since you have to load the entire
       file into an array in memory. Array::FileReader removes the
       inefficiency by only storing the line offsets in memory, and only
       discovering the line offsets when a line is called for. For instance,
       $foo[4] will only load 4 numbers into memory, and then $foo[30] will
       load another 26.

       Because the file offsets are discovered when needed, there's no good
       way of getting the size of the file - you just have to pad through them
       all, which is slow.

       The module was designed to speed up Mark-Jason Dominus' Algorithm::Diff
       module when finding differences between two very large files. In fact,
       it makes things less efficient, since the first thing that module does
       is find the size of the arrays.  It just goes to show, doesn't it?
