NAME
       pa-applet - PulseAudio control applet

SYNOPSIS
       pa-applet [--disable-key-grabbing] [--disable-notifications]
       pa-applet [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       pa-applet allows you to control some of PulseAudio's features such as
       volume levels and active profile. It is a systray applet that can be
       embedded in the notification area of a desktop panel.

       By default, pa-applet attempts to grab volume keys so those keys can be
       used to control the volume level for PulseAudio's default sink.
       pa-applet also shows notifications when the volume is changed this way,
       provided you have a notification daemon running.

OPTIONS
       -h/--help                 Display usage information and exit

       --disable-key-grabbing    Don't attempt to grab volume keys

       --disable-notifications   Don't attempt to display notifications
