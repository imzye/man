NAME
       sacc - a terminal gopher client

SYNOPSIS
       sacc URL

DESCRIPTION
       sacc (short for saccomys) is a terminal gopher client. Gopher is a
       simple protocol to retrieve hierarchical information. The protocol is
       defined in RFC 1436 (Gopher).

       sacc also supports non-standard TLS encryption, if built with TLS
       support, with the gophers:// scheme.  It will search the
       ~/.share/sacc/cert directory for local certificates.

SHORTCUTS
       Shortcuts can be redefined in the config.h.  The manpage is showing the
       default shortcuts.

       ^D or q

ENVIRONMENT
       sacc will use the pager set in the PAGER variable to display textual
       content.  If unset, it'll try to use more(1).  Note that sacc takes
       back control of the screen as soon as the pager finishes.  In case of
       doubt, read your pager documentation.

       If built with TLS support, sacc will search for local TLS certificates
       in the directory set in the SACC_CERT_DIR variable, instead of the
       default path (~/.share/sacc/cert).

PLUMBER
       When some file is opened sacc cannot open natively, it will run
       xdg-open.  This can be configured in the config.h to run some other
       plumber.

CUSTOMIZATION
       sacc can be customized by creating a custom config.h and (re)compiling
       the source code. This keeps it fast, secure and simple.

VERSION
       It is possible to get sacc version from the binary with the standard
       what(1) tool.
