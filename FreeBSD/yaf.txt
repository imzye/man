NAME
       airdaemon - Run a program as a daemon process, restarting it if it dies

SYNOPSIS
           airdaemon   [--retry RETRY_DELAY] [--retry-max RETRY_MAX_DELAY]
                       [--pidfile PID_FILE] [--airdaemon-pidfile PID_FILE]
                       [--log LOG_SPECIFIER] [--loglevel LOG_LEVEL]
                       [--verbose] [--version] [--no-daemon]
                       -- PROGRAM [PROGRAM_ARGS]

DESCRIPTION
       airdaemon invokes a child process and ensures that it is restarted if
       it encounters any errors.  The delay between child exit and restart can
       be chosen, and can either be constant or exponentially increasing up to
       a specified maximum.

       Use of two dashes (--) after all airdaemon command-line switches allows
       PROGRAM_ARGS to be interpreted by the PROGRAM rather than airdaemon
       itself.  While they are not strictly required if you do not need to
       pass arguments to PROGRAM, they should be used for consistency.

OPTIONS
   Daemon Options
       --retry=RETRY_DELAY
           Wait RETRY_DELAY seconds after the child process exits abnormally
           until trying to restart the child process.  See also --retry-max

       --retry-max=RETRY_MAX_DELAY
           This parameter, combined with the --retry parameter, facilitates
           truncated binary exponential backoff of the retry logic.  The first
           retry attempt will be delayed by the value of the --retry
           parameter.  If the child process exits abnormally within this time
           period, the delay is doubled.  Once the child process survives
           longer than the value of the --retry parameter, the retry delay is
           reset to that value.

           For example, assume --retry=30 and --retry-max=240.  The first time
           the child process exits abnormally, airdaemon will wait 30 seconds
           before invoking the child process again.  If it exits abnormally
           again within 30 seconds, airdaemon will wait 60 seconds and try
           again.  If the process dies again within 30 seconds, the delay
           doubles again to 120.  The process continues until the delay hits
           the maximum of 240.  Once the child process survives for 30
           seconds, the delay will be reset to the original retry delay of 30.

       --pidfile=PID_FILE
           Write the process identifier of the child process to PID_FILE.
           Each time the child process is restarted, the process identifier in
           this file is updated. This option exists to facilitate the
           termination of the child process by shutdown scripts. Note that if
           the child process terminates normally during shutdown, airdaemon
           will terminate normally as well, so it is usually sufficient just
           to kill the pid in this file at shutdown.

       --airdaemon-pidfile=PID_FILE
           Write the process identifier of the airdaemon process to PID_FILE.
           This option exists to facilitate the termination of the forked
           airdaemon process by shutdown scripts.

       --no-daemon
           Do not actually daemonize.  Mainly useful for testing/debugging.

   Logging Options
       These options are used to specify how log messages are routed.
       airdaemon can log to standard error, regular files, or the UNIX syslog
       facility.

       --log LOG_SPECIFIER
           Specifies destination for log messages. LOG_SPECIFIER can be a
           syslog(3) facility name, the special value stderr for standard
           error, or the absolute path to a file for file logging. Standard
           error logging is only available in --daemon mode if --foreground is
           present. The default log specifier is stderr if available, user
           otherwise.

       --loglevel LOG_LEVEL
           Specify minimum level for logged messages. In increasing levels of
           verbosity, the supported log levels are quiet, error, critical,
           warning, message, info, and debug. The default logging level is
           warning.

       --verbose
           Equivalent to --loglevel debug.

       --version
           If present, print version and copyright information to standard
           error and exit.

EXAMPLES
       The following will ping www.cert.org every 15 seconds until ping
       returns sucess:

           airdaemon --retry 15 -- ping -c 1 www.cert.org

       The same as above, except the delay will double until reaching a
       maximum of 15 minutes:

           airdaemon --retry 15 --retry-max 900 -- ping -c 1 www.cert.org

BUGS
       Known issues are listed in the README file in the Airframe source
       distribution. Note that airdaemon should be considered alpha-quality
       software; not every concievable input and aggregation is exhaustively
       tested at each release, and specific features may be completely
       untested. Please be mindful of this before deploying airdaemon in
       production environments. Bug reports and feature requests may be sent
       via email to <netsa-help@cert.org>.
