NAME
       tuptime - Report historical and statistical real time of the system,
       keeping it between restarts. Total uptime.


SYNOPSIS
       tuptime [-h] [-A STARTUP] [-b] [-c] [-d DATETIME_FMT] [-e DECIMALS] [-E
       STARTUP] [-f FILE] [-g] [-i] [-k] [-l] [-n] [-o TYPE] [-p] [-q] [-r]

DESCRIPTION
       Tuptime report historical and statistical real time of the system,
       keeping it between restarts. Indeed, it can:
              - Count system startups
              - Register first boot time (a.k.a. installation time)
              - Count nicely and accidentally shutdowns
              - Uptime and downtime percentage since first boot time
              - Accumulated system uptime (running and sleeping), downtime and
              total
              - Register used kernels and boot IDs
              - Report current uptime
              - Print formatted table or list with the system history
              - Narrow reports since, until or at a given startup or timestamp
              - Output in csv format

   ENVIRONMENT
       TUPTIME_DBF
              Set an alternative database file path. The argument -f, --filedb
              takes precedence over this.


DEFAULT OUTPUT
       System startups:
              Total number of system startups from since first timestamp
              available.

       System shutdowns:
              Total number of shutdowns done correctly or incorrectly.

       System life:
              Time counter since first startup timestamp available.

       System uptime:
       System downtime:
              Percentage of time and time counter.

       Longest uptime:
       Longest downtime:
              Time counter and date with the complete longest uptime/downtime
              register.

       Average uptime:
       Average downtime:
              Average time counter.

       Current uptime:
              Actual time counter and datetime since registered boot
              timestamp.


EXAMPLES
       tuptime
              Default output.

       tuptime -t
              Enumerate system life as table.

       tuptime -l
              Enumerate system life as list.

       tuptime -k
              Add kernel information to the output.

       tuptime --csv
              Report in csv format.

       tuptime -s
              Change default human readable datetime/timestamp style and print
              times in seconds and datetimes in epoch.

       tuptime -d '%H:%M:%S %m-%d-%Y'
              Change the datetime/timestamp format. By default the output use
              the configured system locales.

       tuptime --tsince -31557600
              Report since one year ago.
