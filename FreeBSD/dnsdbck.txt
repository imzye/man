DNSDBCK
       dnsdbck - check and, if possible, repair the DNS database

SYNOPSIS
       dnsdbck [options] [zone] [zone...]

DESCRIPTION
       Dnsdbck checks the DNS database for consistency and repairs it, when
       possible.  For each record in a specified set of zones, it checks
       whether a corresponding reverse exists.  If it does not, dnsdbck tries
       to create it, if the corresponding "in-addr.arpa" zone is present in
       the database or if its IP address falls within CIDRs set using the
       --create-reverse-soa option (see below).  In the latter case,
       corresponding SOA and NS records will be created.

OPTIONS
       --all, -a
           Process all zones.  When this option is used, any zone arguments
           are ignored.

       --create-reverse-soa=cidr,[cidr...]
           Create SOA and NS records for reverse zones matching given CIDRs.

       --ignore-zone=zone[,zone...]
           Ignore changes to the listed zones.

       --ignore-zone-from=FILE
           Read the list of zones to ignore from FILE.  The file format is:
           one zone per line, UNIX comments and empty lines are ignored.

       --ignore-host=host[,host...]
           Ignore changes to the listed hostnames.

       --ignore-host-from=FILE
           Read the list of hostnames to ignore from FILE.  The file format
           is: one host per line, UNIX comments and empty lines are ignored.

       --my-cnf=FILE, -c FILE
           Use FILE as MySQL options file.  Default is "$HOME/.my.cnf".

       --author=NAME, -a NAME
           Use NAME for the author column.  Default is your login name.

       --user-name=NAME, -u NAME
           Switch to the privileges of user NAME after startup.

       --outfile=FILE, -o FILE
           Write SQL instructions to repair the database to FILE.  Implies
           --dry-run.

       --log-file=FILE, -l FILE
           Write diagnostic output to FILE, instead of standard error.

       --dry-run, -n
           Do not try to repair the database.

       --debug[=spec[,spec...]], -d[spec[,spec...]]
           Set debugging level.  spec is either category or category=level,
           category is a debugging category name and level is a decimal
           verbosity level.  Valid categories are: "GENERAL", "SQL", "DNS" and
           "MISSING" (all case-insensitive).  If level is not supplied, 1 is
           used instead.

       -h  Show a terse help summary and exit.

       --help
           Prints the manual page and exits.

CONFIGURATION
       The program reads its configuration from one of the following
       locations:

       a. File name given by "DNSDBCK_CONF" environment variable (if set)
       b. ~/.dnsdbck.conf
       c. /etc/dnsdbck.conf

       First of these files that exists is read.  It is an error, if the
       $DNSDBCK_CONF variable is set, but points to a file that does not
       exist.  It is not an error if $DNSDBCK_CONF is not set and neither of
       the two remaining files exist.  It is, however, an error if any of the
       file exists, but is not readable.

       The configuration file uses usual UNIX configuration format.  Empty
       lines and UNIX comments are ignored.  Each non-empty line is either an
       option name, or option assignment, i.e. opt=val, with any amount of
       optional whitespace around the equals sign.  Valid option names are the
       same as long command line options, but without the leading --.  For
       example:

         all
         ignore-zones-from = /etc/dns/zone.ignore
         ignore-hosts-from = /etc/dns/host.ignore
         my-cnf            = /etc/dns/my.cnf

ENVIRONMENT
       DNSDBCK_CONF
           The name of the configuration file to read, instead of the default
           /etc/dnsdbck.conf.
