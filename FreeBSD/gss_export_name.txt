GSS_EXPORT_NAME(3)  FreeBSD Library Functions Manual (prm)  GSS_EXPORT_NAME(3)

NAME
     gss_export_name – Convert an MN to export form

SYNOPSIS
     #include <gssapi/gssapi.h>

     OM_uint32
     gss_export_name(OM_uint32 *minor_status, const gss_name_t input_name,
         gss_buffer_t exported_name);

DESCRIPTION
     To produce a canonical contiguous string representation of a mechanism
     name (MN), suitable for direct comparison (e.g. with memcmp) for use in
     authorization functions (e.g. matching entries in an access-control
     list).  The input_name parameter must specify a valid MN (i.e. an
     internal name generated by gss_accept_sec_context() or by
     gss_canonicalize_name().)

PARAMETERS
     minor_status       Mechanism specific status code.

     input_name         The MN to be exported.

     exported_name      The canonical contiguous string form of input_name.
                        Storage associated with this string must freed by the
                        application after use with gss_release_buffer().

RETURN VALUES
     GSS_S_COMPLETE          Successful completion

     GSS_S_NAME_NOT_MN       The provided internal name was not a mechanism
                             name.

     GSS_S_BAD_NAME          The provided internal name was ill-formed.

     GSS_S_BAD_NAMETYPE      The internal name was of a type not supported by
                             the GSS-API implementation.
