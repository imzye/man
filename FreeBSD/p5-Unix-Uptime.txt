NAME
       Unix::Uptime - Determine the current uptime, in seconds, and load
       averages, across different *NIX architectures

SYNOPSIS
         # Standard Usage
         use Unix::Uptime;

         my $uptime = Unix::Uptime->uptime(); # 2345

         # "HiRes" mode
         use Unix::Uptime qw(:hires);

         my $uptime = Unix::Uptime->uptime_hires(); # 2345.123593

         # Load Average
         my ($load1, $load5, $load15) = Unix::Uptime->load(); # (1.0, 2.0, 0.0)

DESCRIPTION
       This is a rather simple module that abstracts the task of figuring out
       the current system uptime, in seconds. It was born out of a desire to
       do this on non-Linux systems, without SNMP. If you want to use SNMP,
       there are pleanty of modules on CPAN already.

       Additionally, since version 0.33_02, it supports retrieving the load
       average.

       Currently, this module just supports Linux, FreeBSD, Darwin (Mac OS X),
       OpenBSD, and NetBSD. It should be easy enough to add support for other
       operating systems, though.

OPTIONS
       While this module doesn't provide any functions for exporting, if the
       tag ":hires" is given, then uptime_hires static method will be
       available. It returns decimal numbers when possible, but on some
       systems it is simply an alias for uptime(). This will likely require
       the Time::HiRes module to be available. Otherwise, they will simply be
       whole seconds.

METHODS
       The following static (class) methods are available:

   uptime
       This takes no arguments, and simply returns the number of seconds this
       system has been running. This will always be an integer.

   uptime_hires
       This is only available if the ":hires" import tag is used. It returns
       the system uptime with a greater resolution than one second on
       supported platforms. On some platforms, its results may not be any more
       precise than uptime(), though. On different platforms, this requires
       different additional modules:

       Linux
           No additional requirements.

       FreeBSD
           Requires Time::HiRes

       Darwin, OpenBSD, NetBSD
           No more precise than uptime()

   load
       This returns an array of the load averages for the last 1, 5, and 15
       minutes. The degree of precision varies from system to system.

SEE ALSO
       Sys::Load(3) and Sys::Uptime(3) for Linux-specific implementations.

       Win32::Uptime for Win32.

BUGS
       This currently doesn't support more than Linux, FreeBSD, Darwin (Mac OS
       X), OpenBSD, and NetBSD. Contributions for other operating systems
       would be welcome.

CAVEATS
       NOTE: This module is still a work in progress, under fairly heavy
       development.  While I think the final API should be mostly finalized at
       this point, I won't commit to an API freeze until version 1.0.
