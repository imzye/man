File::DesktopEntry(3)                      User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       File::DesktopEntry - Object to handle .desktop files

SYNOPSIS
           use File::DesktopEntry;

           my $entry = File::DesktopEntry->new('firefox');

           print "Using ".$entry->Name." to open http://perl.org\n";
           $entry->run('http://perl.org');

DESCRIPTION
       This module is designed to work with .desktop files. The format of
       these files is specified by the freedesktop "Desktop Entry"
       specification. This module can parse these files but also knows how to
       run the applications defined by these files.

       For this module version 1.0 of the specification was used.

       This module was written to support File::MimeInfo::Applications.

       Please remember: case is significant for the names of Desktop Entry
       keys.

VARIABLES
       You can set the global variable $File::DesktopEntry::VERBOSE. If set
       the module prints a warning every time a command gets executed.

       The global variable $File::DesktopEntry::LOCALE tells you what the
       default locale being used is. However, changing it will not change the
       default locale.

AUTOLOAD
       All methods that start with a capital are autoloaded as get(KEY) where
       key is the autoloaded method name.

METHODS
       new(FILE)
       new(\$TEXT)
       new(NAME)
           Constructor. FILE, NAME or TEXT are optional arguments.

           When a name is given (a string without '"/"', '"\"' or '"."') a
           lookup is done using File::BaseDir. If the file found in this
           lookup is not writable or if no file was found, the XDG_DATA_HOME
           path will be used when writing.

       lookup(NAME)
           Returns a filename for a desktop entry with desktop file id NAME.

       wants_uris( )
           Returns true if the Exec string for this desktop entry specifies
           that the application uses URIs instead of paths. This can be used
           to determine whether an application uses a VFS library.

       wants_list( )
           Returns true if the Exec string for this desktop entry specifies
           that the application can handle multiple arguments at once.

       run(@FILES)
           Forks and runs the application specified in this Desktop Entry with
           arguments FILES as a background process. Returns the pid.

           The child process fails when this is not a Desktop Entry of type
           Application or if the Exec key is missing or invalid.

           If the desktop entry specifies that the program needs to be
           executed in a terminal the $TERMINAL environment variable is used.
           If this variable is not set "xterm -e" is used as default.

           (On Windows this method returns a Win32::Process object.)

       system(@FILES)
           Like run() but using the system() system call.  It only return
           after the application has ended.

       exec(@FILES)
           Like run() but using the exec() system call. This method is
           expected not to return but to replace the current process with the
           application you try to run.

           On Windows this method doesn't always work the way you want it to
           due to the fork() emulation on this platform. Try using run() or
           system() instead.

       parse_Exec(@FILES)
           Expands the Exec format in this desktop entry with. Returns a
           properly quoted string in scalar context or a list of words in list
           context. Dies when the Exec key is invalid.

           It supports the following fields:

               %f    single file
               %F    multiple files
               %u    single url
               %U    multiple urls
               %i    Icon field prefixed by --icon
               %c    Name field, possibly translated
               %k    location of this .desktop file
               %%    literal '%'

           If necessary this method tries to convert between paths and URLs
           but this is not perfect.

           Fields that are deprecated, but (still) supported by this module:

               %d    single directory
               %D    multiple directories

           The fields %n, %N, %v and %m are deprecated and will cause a
           warning if $VERBOSE is used. Any other unknown fields will cause an
           error.

           The fields %F, %U, %D and %i can only occur as separate words
           because they expand to multiple arguments.

           Also see "LIMITATIONS".

       get(KEY)
       "get(GROUP, KEY)"
           Get a value for KEY from GROUP. If GROUP is not specified 'Desktop
           Entry' is used. All values are treated as string, so e.g. booleans
           will be returned as the literal strings "true" and "false".

           When KEY does not contain a language code you get the translation
           in the current locale if available or a sensible default. The
           request a specific language you can add the language part. E.g.
           "$entry->get('Name[nl_NL]')" can return either the value of the
           'Name[nl_NL]', the 'Name[nl]' or the 'Name' key in the Desktop
           Entry file. Exact language parsing order can be found in the spec.
           To force you get the untranslated key use either 'Name[C]' or
           'Name[POSIX]'.

       "set(KEY => VALUE, ...)"
       "set(GROUP, KEY => VALUE, ...)"
           Set values for one or more keys. If GROUP is not given "Desktop
           Entry" is used.  All values are treated as strings, backslashes,
           newlines and tabs are escaped.  To set a boolean key you need to
           use the literal strings "true" and "false".

           Unlike the get() call languages are not handled automatically for
           set().  KEY should include the language part if you want to set a
           translation.  E.g. "$entry->set("Name[nl_NL]" => "Tekst
           Verwerker")" will set a Dutch translation for the Name key. Using
           either "Name[C]" or "Name[POSIX]" will be equivalent with not
           giving a language argument.

           When setting the Exec key without specifying a group it will be
           parsed and quoted correctly as required by the spec. You can use
           quoted arguments to include whitespace in a argument, escaping
           whitespace does not work.  To circumvent this quoting explicitly
           give the group name 'Desktop Entry'.

       text()
           Returns the (modified) text of the file.

       read(FILE)
       read(\$SCALAR)
           Read Desktop Entry data from file or memory buffer.  Without
           argument defaults to file given at constructor.

           If you gave a file, text buffer or name to the constructor this
           method will be called automatically.

       read_fh(IO)
           Read Desktop Entry data from filehandle or IO object.

       write(FILE)
           Write the Desktop Entry data to FILE. Without arguments it writes
           to the filename given to the constructor if any.

           The keys Name and Type are required. Type can be either
           "Application", "Link" or "Directory". For an application set the
           optional key "Exec". For a link set the "URL" key.

   Backwards Compatibility
       Methods supported for backwards compatibility with 0.02.

       new_from_file(FILE)
           Alias for new(FILE).

       new_from_data(TEXT)
           Alias for new(\$TEXT).

       "get_value(NAME, GROUP, LANG)"
           Identical to "get(GROUP, "NAME[LANG]")".  LANG defaults to 'C',
           GROUP is optional.

NON-UNIX PLATFORMS
       This module has a few bits of code to make it work on Windows. It
       handles "file://" uri a bit different and it uses Win32::Process. On
       other platforms your mileage may vary.

       Please note that the specification is targeting Unix platforms only and
       will only have limited relevance on other platforms. Any platform-
       dependent behavior in this module should be considered an extension of
       the spec.

LIMITATIONS
       If you try to exec a remote file with an application that can only
       handle files on the local file system we should -according to the spec-
       download the file to a temp location. This is not supported. Use the
       wants_uris() method to check if an application supports urls.

       The values of the various Desktop Entry keys are not parsed (except for
       the Exec key). This means that booleans will be returned as the strings
       "true" and "false" and lists will still be ";" separated.

       If the icon is given as name and not as path it should be resolved for
       the %i code in the Exec key. We need a separate module for the icon
       spec to deal with this.

       According to the spec comments can contain any encoding. However since
       this module read files as utf8, invalid UTF-8 characters in a comment
       will cause an error.

       There is no support for Legacy-Mixed Encoding. Everybody is using utf8
       now ... right ?
