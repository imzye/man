ALSA-SEQ-SERVER(8)      FreeBSD System Manager's Manual     ALSA-SEQ-SERVER(8)

NAME
     alsa-seq-server – daemon that converts one or more raw MIDI device(s)
     into an ALSA sequencer server.

SYNOPSIS
     alsa-seq-server [-F <filter>] [-d <device_name>]
                     [-C <capture_device_name>] [-P <playback_device_name>]
                     [-U <username>] [-G <groupname>] [-m <devicemode>]
                     [-s <devicename>] [-i <rtprio>] [-B] [-h]

DESCRIPTION
     alsa-seq-server is a daemon that provides access to raw USB/socket MIDI
     devices via the ALSA sequencer API.  The daemon will not exit when a
     device becomes unavailable, but will wait until the device re-appears
     again.

     The following options are available:

     -B      Run the client in background mode.

     -F      Specify a simple device name filter, which is used to match
             character device entries in /dev/ .  As new devices appear, they
             are automatically made visible to other ALSA MIDI clients.

     -d      Specify the device name of the USB device to use, for example
             /dev/umidi0.0 .  This option can be repeated to specify more
             devices.

     -C      Specify the capture only device name of the USB device to use,
             for example /dev/umidi0.0 .  This option can be repeated to
             specify more capture devices.

     -P      Specify the playback only device name of the USB device to use,
             for example /dev/umidi0.0 .  This option can be repeated to
             specify more playback only devices.

     -s      Specify character device name for ALSA sequencer.  The default is
             snd/seq.

     -U      Specify username for the ALSA character device.  The default is
             root.

     -G      Specify groupname for the ALSA character device.  The default is
             wheel.

     -m      Specify mode for the ALSA character device.  The default is 0666.

     -i priority
             Set real-time priority to priority.  Refer to rtprio(1) for more
             information.

     -h      Print help text showing available options.

EXAMPLES
           # Start ALSA sequencer server in background mode
           alsa-seq-server -d /dev/umidi0.0 -B

           # Start ALSA sequencer server in background mode for all umidi<XXX> devices
           alsa-seq-server -F umidi -B

           # List all available ALSA sequencer ports
           aconnect -l

           # Connect two ALSA sequencer ports
           aconnect 1:0 2:0

TROUBLESHOOTING
     Check that the permissions are correct for your MIDI devices and that the
     cuse kernel module is loaded.
