OTUS(4)                FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                OTUS(4)

NAME
     otus – Atheros AR9170 USB IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n wireless network device

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device ehci
           device uhci
           device ohci
           device usb
           device otus
           device wlan

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_otus_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The otus driver supports USB 2.0 wireless network devices based on the
     Atheros AR9170 chipset.

     The Atheros AR9170 is a draft-802.11n adapter that uses an external radio
     to operate in either 2.4GHz only or 2.4GHz and 5GHz.

     The AR9101 radio supports 1T1R operation in 2GHz only.

     The AR9102 radio supports 2T2R operation in 2GHz only.

     The AR9104 radio supports 2T2R operation both 2GHz and 5GHz.

     These are the modes the otus driver can operate in:

     BSS mode       Also known as infrastructure mode, this is used when
                    associating with an access point, through which all
                    traffic passes.  This mode is the default.

     The otus driver can be configured to use Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
     or Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA-PSK and WPA2-PSK).  WPA is the de facto
     encryption standard for wireless networks.  It is strongly recommended
     that WEP not be used as the sole mechanism to secure wireless
     communication, due to serious weaknesses in it.

     The otus driver can be configured at runtime with ifconfig(8).

FILES
     The driver needs at least version 1.0 of the following firmware files,
     which is loaded when an interface is attached:

           /boot/kernel/otusfw-init.ko
           /boot/kernel/otusfw-main.ko

HARDWARE
     The otus driver provices support for Atheros AR9170 USB IEEE 802.11b/g/n

EXAMPLES
     Join an existing BSS network (i.e., connect to an access point):

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev otus0 inet 192.168.0.20 \
               netmask 0xffffff00

     Join a specific BSS network with network name “my_net”:

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev otus0 ssid my_net up

     Join a specific BSS network with 64-bit WEP encryption:

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev otus0 ssid my_net \
                   wepmode on wepkey 0x1234567890 weptxkey 1 up

DIAGNOSTICS
     %s: failed load firmware of file otusfw-main  For some reason, the driver
     was unable to read the microcode file from the filesystem.  The file
     might be missing or corrupted.

HISTORY
     The otus driver first appeared in OpenBSD 4.6.

AUTHORS
     The otus driver was written by Damien Bergamini <damien@openbsd.org> and
     ported by Adrian Chadd <adrian@freebsd.org>.

CAVEATS
     The otus driver only supports 802.11a/b/g operations.  802.11n operation
     is not supported at this time.
