TCPILLUST(1)            FreeBSD General Commands Manual           TCPILLUST(1)

NAME
     tcpillust – a graphical TCP connection analysis tool

SYNOPSIS
     tcpillust [-Vhv] [-g geometry] file [file]

DESCRIPTION
     tcpillust takes tcpdump file(s) specified on the command line and draw
     pictures like figures in the ``TCP/IP Illustrated'' series.

     Tcpdump files used by tcpillust should contain only data for a single TCP
     connection. If other data are contained in the tcpdump files, tcpillust
     can't generate results or the results will be inaccurate.

     When tcpillust takes a single tcpdump file, it guesses transmit time and
     receive time on the remote host. When tcpillust takes two tcpdump files,
     it regards them as tcp-client side file and tcp-server side file, and
     generate the results from them.  If you want precise analysis, you should
     use two tcpdump files.

Options
     -g geometry
             Set the size and location of the window.

     -h      Display the usage and exit.

     -v      Display the Tcpillust version and exit.

     -V      Be verbose.  Generate debugging output to standard output.
