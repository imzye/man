NAME
       Chemistry::File::MDLMol - MDL molfile reader/writer

SYNOPSIS
           use Chemistry::File::MDLMol;

           # read a molecule
           my $mol = Chemistry::Mol->read('myfile.mol');

           # write a molecule
           $mol->write("myfile.mol");

           # use a molecule as a query for substructure matching
           use Chemistry::Pattern;
           use Chemistry::Ring;
           Chemistry::Ring::aromatize_mol($mol);

           my $patt = Chemistry::Pattern->read('query.mol');
           if ($patt->match($mol)) {
               print "it matches!\n";
           }

DESCRIPTION
       MDL Molfile (V2000) reader/writer.

       This module automatically registers the 'mdl' format with
       Chemistry::Mol.

       The first three lines of the molfile are stored as $mol->name,
       $mol->attr("mdlmol/line2"), and $mol->attr("mdlmol/comment").

       This version only reads and writes some of the information available in
       a molfile: it reads coordinats, atom and bond types, charges, radicals,
       and atom lists. It does not read other things such as stereochemistry,
       3d properties, isotopes, etc.

       This module is part of the PerlMol project, <http://www.perlmol.org>.

   Query properties
       The MDL molfile format supports query properties such as atom lists,
       and special bond types such as "single or double", "single or
       aromatic", "double or aromatic", "ring bond", or "any". These
       properties are supported by this module in conjunction with
       Chemistry::Pattern. However, support for query properies is currently
       read-only, and the other properties listed in the specification are not
       supported yet.

       So that atom and bond objects can use these special query options, the
       conditions are represented as Perl subroutines. The generated code can
       be read from the 'mdlmol/test_sub' attribute:

           $atom->attr('mdlmol/test_sub');
           $bond->attr('mdlmol/test_sub');

       This may be useful for debugging, such as when an atom doesn't seem to
       match as expected.

   Aromatic Queries
       To be able to search for aromatic substructures are represented by
       Kekule structures, molfiles that are read as patterns (with
       "Chemistry::Pattern-"read) are aromatized automatically by using the
       Chemistry::Ring module. The default bond test from
       Chemistry::Pattern::Bond is overriden by one that checks the
       aromaticity in addition to the bond order.  The test is,

           $patt->aromatic ?  $bond->aromatic
               : (!$bond->aromatic && $patt->order == $bond->order);

       That is, aromatic pattern bonds match aromatic bonds, and aliphatic
       pattern bonds match aliphatic bonds with the same bond order.
