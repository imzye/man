NAME
       Net::FS::Flickr - store and retrieve files on Flickr

SYNOPSIS
           my $fs = Net::FS::Flickr->new( key => $key, secret => $secret );

           $fs->set_auth($auth_key); # see API KEYS AND AUTH KEY section
           $fs->store("file.txt");
           $fs->store("piccy.jpg", "renamed_piccy.jpg");

           open (FILE, ">output.jpg") || die "Couldn't write to file: $!\n";
           binmode (FILE);
           print FILE $fs->retrieve("renamed_piccy.jpg");
           close (FILE);

API KEYS AND AUTH KEY
       You will need to sign up for an API key and then get the corresponding
       secret key. You can do that from here

       http://www.flickr.com/services/api/key.gne

       Finally you will need to get an auth key. As described here

       http://www.flickr.com/services/api/auth.howto.desktop.html

       the helper script "flickrfs" supplied with this distribution can help
       with that.

METHODS
   new
       Takes a valid API key and a valid secret key

   files [nsid, email or username]
       Get a list of all the files on the system

       Given an nsid, username or email, use that. Otherwise use the nsid from
       the auth token.

   versions <filename> [nsid, email or username]
       Returns a list of all the versions of a file

       Each item on the list is a hashref containing the date the file was
       saved and the id of that version using the keys timestamp and id
       respectively.

       The list is sorted, latest version first.

       Because of the way Flickr stores sets, timestamp will always be 0;

       Given an nsid, username or email, use that. Otherwise use the nsid from
       the auth token.

   retrieve <filename> [version]
       Get <filename> from Flickr.

       If the file has multiple versions then you can pass in a version number
       to get version - 1 being the oldest. If you don't pass in a version
       then you get the latest.

   store <filename> [as]
       Store the file <filename> on Flickr. If a second filename is given then
       use that as the name on Flickr

       This works by stashing the data in the least significant bits of as
       many images as is need. by default an, err, default image is used. But
       you can set alternative images using the image_pool() method.

   image_pool [image[s]]
       With no arguments, returns an array of all the images in the current
       image pool.

       If you pass in one or more filenames or Imager objects then those are
       set as the current pool.

   set_auth <auth key>
       Set the app authorisation key.
