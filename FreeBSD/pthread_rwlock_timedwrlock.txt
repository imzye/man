PTHREAD_RWLOCK_TIMEDWRLOCK(3)                 FreeBSD Library Functions Manual

NAME
     pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock – acquire a read-write lock for writing or
     give up after a specified period

LIBRARY
     POSIX Threads Library (libpthread, -lpthread)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <pthread.h>

     int
     pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock(pthread_rwlock_t *restrict rwlock,
         const struct timespec *restrict abs_timeout);

DESCRIPTION
     This function acquires a write lock on the read-write lock rwlock.
     However, if the lock cannot be acquired without waiting for another
     thread to unlock the lock, this wait shall be terminated when abs_timeout
     expires.

     If the thread should be interrupted by a signal, the
     pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock() function will be automatically restarted
     after the thread returns from the signal handler.

     The calling thread may deadlock if at the time the call is made it holds
     rwlock.  The results are undefined if this function is called with an
     uninitialized read-write lock.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
     To prevent writer starvation, writers are favored over readers.

RETURN VALUES
     If successful, the pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock() function will return
     zero.  Otherwise, an error number will be returned to indicate the error.

     This function shall not return an error code of EINTR.

ERRORS
     The pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock() function shall fail if:

     [ETIMEDOUT]        The lock could not be acquired before the specified
                        timeout expired.

     The pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock() function may fail if:

     [EDEADLK]          The calling thread already holds rwlock.

     [EINVAL]           The value specified by rwlock does not refer to an
                        initialized read-write lock object, or the abs_timeout
                        nanosecond value is less than zero or greater than or
                        equal to 1 billion.
