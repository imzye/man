RMAIL(8)                FreeBSD System Manager's Manual               RMAIL(8)



NAME
       rmail - handle remote mail received via uucp

SYNOPSIS
       rmail [-D domain] [-T] user ...

DESCRIPTION
       Rmail interprets incoming mail received via uucp(1), collapsing
       ``From'' lines in the form generated by mail.local(8) into a single
       line of the form ``return-path!sender'', and passing the processed mail
       on to sendmail(8).

       Rmail is explicitly designed for use with uucp and sendmail.

   Flags
       -D     Use the specified domain instead of the default domain of
              ``UUCP''.

       -T     Turn on debugging.

SEE ALSO
       uucp(1), mail.local(8), sendmail(8)

HISTORY
       The rmail program appeared in 4.2BSD.

BUGS
       Rmail should not reside in /bin.
