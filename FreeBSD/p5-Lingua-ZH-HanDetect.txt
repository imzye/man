NAME
       Lingua::ZH::HanDetect - Guess Chinese text's variant and encoding

VERSION
       This document describes version 0.04 of Lingua::ZH::HanDetect, released
       June 27, 2003.

SYNOPSIS
           use Lingua::ZH::HanDetect;

           # $encoding is 'big5-hkscs', 'big5', 'gbk', 'euc-cn', 'utf8' or ''
           # $variant  is 'traditional', 'simplified' or ''
           my ($encoding, $variant) = han_detect($some_chinese_text);

DESCRIPTION
       Lingua::ZH::HanDetect uses statistical measures to test a text string
       to see if it's in Traditional or Simplified Chinese, as well as which
       encoding it is in.

       If the string does not contain Chinese characters, both the encoding
       and variant values will be set to the empty string.

       This module is needed because the various encodings for Chinese text
       tend to occupy the similar byte ranges, rendering "Encode::Guess"
       ineffective.
