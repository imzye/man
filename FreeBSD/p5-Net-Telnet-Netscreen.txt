Net::Telnet::Netscreen(3)                  User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Net::Telnet::Netscreen - interact with a Netscreen firewall

SYNOPSIS
       use Net::Telnet::Netscreen;

       my $fw = new Net::Telnet::Netscreen(host=>'192.168.1.1');
       $fw->login('admin','password') or die $fw->error;
       $fw->enter_vsys('wineasy.no'); print "We are now in:
       ".$fw->current_vsys."\n"; my %vsys=$fw->get_vsys;
          foreach $key (sort (keys %vsys)) {
            print $key,'=', $vsys{$key},"\n";
          } print @results;

DESCRIPTION
       Net::Telnet::Netscreen is mostly a pure rippoff of Net::Telnet::Cisco,
       with adaptations to make it work on the Netscreen firewalls.  It also
       has some additional commands, but for basic functionality, see
       Net::Telnet and Net::Telnet::Cisco documentation.

FIRST
       Before you use Net::Telnet::Netscreen, you should probably have a good
       understanding of Net::Telnet, so perldoc Net::Telnet first, and then
       come back to Net::Telnet::Netscreen to see where the improvements are.

       Some things are easier to accomplish with Net::SNMP. SNMP has three
       advantages: it's faster, handles errors better, and doesn't use any
       vtys on the router. SNMP does have some limitations, so for anything
       you can't accomplish with SNMP, there's Net::Telnet::Netscreen.

METHODS
       New methods not found in Net::Telnet follow:

   enter_vsys - enter a virtual system
       Enter a virtual system in the firewall.  parameter is system you want
       to enter .  You may enter another vsys even if you are in a vsys. Note

       ns-500+)

   exit_vsys - exit from the level you are on
       exit from the vsys you are in, or from the system if you are on the
