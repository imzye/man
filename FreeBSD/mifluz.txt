NAME
       htdb_dump -

       dump the content of an inverted index in Berkeley DB fashion



SYNOPSIS

       htdb_dump [-klNpWz] [-S pagesize] [-C cachesize] [-d ahr] [-f file] [-h home] [-s subdb] db_file


DESCRIPTION
       htdb_dump is a slightly modified version of the standard Berkeley DB
       db_dump utility.

       The htdb_dump utility reads the database file db_file and writes it to
       the standard output using a portable flat-text format understood by the
       htdb_load utility. The argument db_file must be a file produced using
       the Berkeley DB library functions.



OPTIONS
       -W     Initialize WordContext(3) before dumping. With the -z flag
              allows to dump inverted indexes using the mifluz(3) specific
              compression scheme. The MIFLUZ_CONFIG environment variable must
              be set to a file containing the mifluz(3) configuration.

       -z     The db_file is compressed. If -W is given the mifluz(3) specific
              compression scheme is used. Otherwise the default gzip
              compression scheme is used.

       -d     Dump the specified database in a format helpful for debugging
              the Berkeley DB library routines.

       a      Display all information.

       h      Display only page headers.

       r      Do not display the free-list or pages on the free list.  This
              mode is used by the recovery tests.

       The output format of the -d option is not standard and may change,
       without notice, between releases of the Berkeley DB library.

       -f     Write to the specified file instead of to the standard output.

       -h     Specify a home directory for the database.  As Berkeley DB
              versions before 2.0 did not support the concept of a database
              home.

       -k     Dump record numbers from Queue and Recno databases as keys.

       -l     List the subdatabases stored in the database.

       -N     Do not acquire shared region locks while running.  Other
              problems such as potentially fatal errors in Berkeley DB will be
              ignored as well.  This option is intended only for debugging
              errors and should not be used under any other circumstances.

       -p     If characters in either the key or data items are printing
              characters (as defined by isprint (3)), use printing characters
              in file to represent them.  This option permits users to use
              standard text editors and tools to modify the contents of
              databases.

              Note, different systems may have different notions as to what
              characters are considered printing characters , and databases
              dumped in this manner may be less portable to external systems.

       -s     Specify a subdatabase to dump.  If no subdatabase is specified,
              all subdatabases found in the database are dumped.

       -V     Write the version number to the standard output and exit.

       Dumping and reloading Hash databases that use user-defined hash
       functions will result in new databases that use the default hash
       function.  While using the default hash function may not be optimal for
       the new database, it will continue to work correctly.

       Dumping and reloading Btree databases that use user-defined prefix or
       comparison functions will result in new databases that use the default
       prefix and comparison functions.  In this case, it is quite likely that
       the database will be damaged beyond repair permitting neither record
       storage or retrieval.  The only available workaround for either case is
       to modify the sources for the htdb_load utility to load the database
       using the correct hash, prefix and comparison functions.



ENVIRONMENT
       DB_HOME If the -h option is not specified and the environment variable
       DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the database home.


       MIFLUZ_CONFIG file name of configuration file read by WordContext(3).
       Defaults to ~/.mifluz.
