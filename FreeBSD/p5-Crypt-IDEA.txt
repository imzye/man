NAME
       IDEA - Perl interface to IDEA block cipher

SYNOPSIS
           use Crypt::IDEA;

DESCRIPTION
       This perl extension is an implementation of the IDEA block cipher
       algorithm.  The module implements the Crypt::BlockCipher interface,
       which has the following methods

       blocksize =item keysize =item encrypt =item decrypt

FUNCTIONS
       blocksize
           Returns the size (in bytes) of the block cipher.

       keysize
           Returns the size (in bytes) of the key.

       new
                   my $cipher = new IDEA $key;

           This creates a new IDEA BlockCipher object, using $key, where $key
           is a key of keysize() bytes.

       encrypt
                   my $cipher = new IDEA $key;
                   my $ciphertext = $cipher->encrypt($plaintext);

           This function encrypts $plaintext and returns the $ciphertext where
           $plaintext and $ciphertext should be of blocksize() bytes.

       decrypt
                   my $cipher = new IDEA $key;
                   my $plaintext = $cipher->decrypt($ciphertext);

           This function decrypts $ciphertext and returns the $plaintext where
           $plaintext and $ciphertext should be of blocksize() bytes.

EXAMPLE
               my $key = pack("H32", "0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF");
               my $cipher = new IDEA $key;
               my $ciphertext = $cipher->encrypt("plaintex");  # NB - 8 bytes
               print unpack("H16", $ciphertext), "\n";

       Module altered between 1999 and 2005  to allow added functionality with
       perl -MCPAN, Changes by Dave Paris  (edited lib paths, endian issues,
       new tests).

       Thank you to contributors for endian patches and new test suite!
