PCPUSTAT(1)             FreeBSD General Commands Manual            PCPUSTAT(1)

NAME
     pcpustat – per-CPU usage statistics

SYNOPSIS
     pcpustat [-ahinqstux] [-c count] [-d delimiter] [-p cpu] [-w wait]

DESCRIPTION
     The pcpustat utility provides per-CPU usage statistics.  This information
     is computed using the same algorithm as in top(1) with the -P option, but
     the output format is more similar to that of iostat(8) so that it can be
     piped and reformatted.

OPTIONS
     -a, -all
             Include all usage statistics (same as -instu).  This is the
             default if no specific statistics are selected.

     -c, -count count
             Sample statistics the specified number of times.  If not
             specified, it defaults to 1 if -w is not specified, otherwise
             forever.

     -d, -delim delimiter
             Delimit columns with delimiter instead of justifying them with
             spaces.

     -h, -help
             Print the list of options and exit.

     -i, -idle
             Include idle time in the statistics.

     -n, -nice
             Include nice time in the statistics.

     -p, -cpu cpu
             Select processor cpu [0-n].  You may repeat the switch to select
             more than one CPU.  The default is to include all CPUs.

     -q, -quiet
             Print no header, only the data.

     -s, -system
             Include system time in the statistics.

     -t, -interrupt
             Include interrupt time in the statistics.

     -u, -user
             Include user time in the statistics.

     -w, -wait wait
             Pause the specified number of seconds between updates.  The
             default is 1.

     -x, -not
             Report the percentage of time not in each state.  If specified,
             each percentage is subtracted from 100.  The header (unless the
             -q option is selected) displays a "!" before each heading.

OUTPUT FORMAT
     If the [-q] option is not specified, the first two lines of output will
     contain a header.

     The first line lists the CPUs, by number.  If the options specify only
     one column of information per CPU, then this line will only contain the
     CPU numbers (starting with 0), otherwise it will contain the string "cpu
     " followed by the number.  This heading will be right-justified over the
     columns that apply to that CPU, unless the [-d] option is specified (in
     which case the headers are also delimited).

     The second header line labels the columns within the output for each CPU.
     These labels can be any of the following:

     us      % of cpu time in user mode
     ni      % of cpu time in user mode running niced processes
     sy      % of cpu time in system mode
     in      % of cpu time in interrupt mode
     id      % of cpu time in idle mode

     If the [-x] option was specified, then each of the above is prefixed by
     '!'.

     The remaining lines of output will be the percentage of time each CPU
     spent in each of the designated states since the previous line (or since
     pcpustat started, in the case of the first line).

     If the [-d] option is specified, then the string specified as its
     argument will occur between each column.  Otherwise, enough spaces will
     be used to right-align each column under its heading.

BUGS
     The pcpustat utility can only report on CPUs 0-n, where n is one less
     than the number of bits in a long.
