Splashscreen(3)              perl/Tk Documentation             Splashscreen(3)


NAME
       Tk::Splashscreen - display a Splashscreen during program
       initialization.

SYNOPSIS
        $splash = $parent->Splashscreen(-opt => val, ... );

DESCRIPTION
       For programs that require large load times, it's a common practice to
       display a Splashscreen that occupies the user's attention.  This
       Toplevel mega widget provides all the display, destroy and timing
       events.  All you do it create the Splashscreen mega widget, populate it
       as you see fit, then invoke Splash() to display it and Destroy() to
       tear it down.

       Important note: be sure to sprinkle update() calls throughout your
       initialization code so that any Splashscreen events are handled.
       Remember, the screen may be animated, or the user may be simply moving
       the Splashscreen about.

OPTIONS
       The following option/value pairs are supported:

       -milliseconds
           The minimum number of milliseconds the Splashscreen should remain
           on the screen.  Default is 0, which means that the Splashscreen is
           destroyed as soon as Destroy() is called.  Otherwise, Destroy()
           waits for the specified time interval to elapse before destroying
           the Splashscreen.

METHODS
   $splash->Splash([milliseconds]);
       If milliseconds is specified, it's the minimum number of milliseconds
       the Splashscreen should remain on the screen.  This value takes
       precedence over that specified on the Splashscreen constructor call.

   $splash->Destroy([milliseconds]);
       If milliseconds is specified, it's the minimum number of milliseconds
       the Splashscreen should remain on the screen.  This value takes
       precedence over that specified on the Splash() call, which takes
       precedence over that specified during Splashscreen construction.

BINDINGS
   <ButtonPress-3>
       Notifies the Splashscreen to set a mark for an impending move.

   <ButtonRelease-3>
       Moves the Splashscreen from the mark to the cursor's current position.

ADVERTISED WIDGETS
       Component subwidgets can be accessed via the Subwidget method.  This
       mega widget has no advertised subwidgets. Instead, treat the widget
       reference as a Toplevel and populate it as desired.

EXAMPLE
        $splash = $mw->Splashscreen;

        ... populate the Splashscreen toplevel as desired ...

        $splash->Splash(4000);

        ... program initialization ...

        $splash->Destroy;
