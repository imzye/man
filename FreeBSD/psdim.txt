NAME
       psdim - calculate optimal page format for n-up printing from a
       postscript file

SYNOPSIS
       psdim [options] [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       psdim is a small utility to be used in conjunction with pstops.  It
       looks at the contents of a postscript document to determine the size of
       the printed pages. From this, it calculates the optimal placement of
       the pages for n-up printing. It outputs a format string suitable for
       processing by pstops.

       In order to determine the size of the pages in a postscript document
       accurately, psdim uses the ghostscript interpreter to render the
       document. For this reason, psdim is relatively slow, but yields very
       accurate results that could not be obtained by just naively looking at
       the postscript headers. For psdim to work, gs must be installed on your
       system.

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       -h, --help Print usage information and exit.

       -v, --version
                  Print version information and exit.

       -l, --license
                  Print license information and exit.

       -q, --quiet
                  Suppress printing progress information. Normally, psdim
                  prints page numbers to stderr for each page processed.

       -x, --width dim
                  Specify the physical width of the output paper.

       -y, --height dim
                  Specify the physical height of the output paper.

       -p, --page format
                  Specify the format of the output paper: one of a4, a3, a5,
                  b5, letter, legal, tabloid, statement, executive, folio,
                  quarto, 10x14. The default is letter. Paper formats are case
                  insensitive. The -p option is equivalent to a corresponding
                  pair or -x and -y options.

       -m, --margin dim
                  Set the width of the margins between the document and the
                  edge of the paper.  The default is 0.5in.

       -n, --hmargin dim
                  Like -m, but only set the horizontal (left and right)
                  margins.

       -o, --vmargin dim
                  Like -m, but only set the vertical (top and bottom) margins.

       -s, --sep dim
                  Set the width of the white space separating input pages when
                  they are combined on a single output page.  The default is
                  0.5in.

       -t, --hsep dim
                  Like -s, but only set the space in the horizontal direction.

       -u, --vsep dim
                  Like -s, but only set the space in the vertical direction.

       -L, --landscape
                  Select the landscape orientation (pages are rotated to the
                  left). This is the default for 2-up and 8-up printing. Note
                  that the printed text is rotated, not the physical page.

       -R, --seascape
                  Select the seascape orientation (pages are rotated to the
                  right). Note that the printed text is rotated, not the
                  physical paper.

       -U, --upside-down
                  Select the upside-down orientation.

       -P, --portrait
                  Select the portrait (upright) orientation. This is the
                  default for 4-up, 9-up, and 16-up printing.

       -f, --format nxm
                  Arrange pages in n rows and m columns.

       -a, --hpolicy n
                  Select the horizontal alignment policy. For n=0, the
                  horizontal alignment of pages follows a rigid grid. For n=1,
                  the pages in each column are aligned, but each column is
                  centered in its available horizontal space. For n=2, each
                  page is centered horizontally in its column. n=3,4 behave
                  like n=1,2, except the width of the columns is variable.

       -b, --vpolicy n
                  Select the vertical alignment policy. For n=0, the vertical
                  alignment of pages follows a rigid grid. For n=1, the pages
                  in each row are aligned, but each row is centered in its
                  available vertical space. For n=2, each page is centered
                  vertically in its row. n=3,4 behave like n=1,2, except the
                  height of the rows is variable.

       -c, --columnmode
                  Arrange the pages in columns (default is in rows). For
                  instance, in 4-up printing, pages 1 and 2 will normally
                  appear above pages 3 and 4. If -c is selected, pages 1 and 2
                  will appear to the left of pages 3 and 4.

       -d, --righttoleft
                  Arrange the pages with page numbers increasing from right to
                  left (default is from left to right).

       -e, --bottomtotop
                  Arrange the pages with page numbers increasing from bottom
                  to top (default is from top to bottom).

       -C, --color
                  Handle colored backgrounds. This option must be given when
                  the document uses a background color other than white. Color
                  processing is significantly slower than black-and-white
                  processing, and should only be used when necessary. Note:
                  while psdim will calculate the correct document dimensions,
                  pstops is very bad at cropping colored backgrounds and will
                  probably do a bad job with such documents.

       -S, --shrink
                  Only shrink, never enlarge page.

       -1, --1up  Fit to size. Equivalent to -f1x1 --portrait.

       -2, --2up  Equivalent to -f1x2 --landscape.

       -4, --4up  Equivalent to -f2x2 --portrait.

       -8, --8up  Equivalent to -f2x4 --landscape.

       -9, --9up  Equivalent to -f3x3 --portrait.

       -6, --16up Equivalent to -f4x4 --portrait.

OPERANDS
       If a filename is given, then a postscript document is read from that
       file. Otherwise, a postscript document is read from standard input.

DIMENSIONS
       Several command line options take a dimension argument. Dimensions can
       carry one of the optional units "in", "cm", "mm", or "pt". Here, 1pt is
       a postscript point, or 1/72 inches. The default unit is "in".

ALIGNMENT POLICIES
       In n-up printing, several input pages are rearranged into rows and
       columns on a single output page. If all the input pages are of equal
       width, height, and margins, then it is a straightforward task to
       arrange them in a grid. However, if the input pages are of variable
       width, height, and/or margins, then several choices arise regarding
       their optimal placement. These choices are governed by the horizontal
       and vertical alignment policies, which are specified by the -a and -b
       options. The horizontal alignment policy affects only the x-coordinates
       of the pages in the output, and the vertical policy affects only the y-
       coordinates.

EXAMPLES
       In the simplest case, psdim can be used to figure out an optimal format
       string for 2-up printing:

              > psdim --2up test.ps
              [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]
              2:0@0.93L(9.79in,-1.13in)+1@0.93L(9.79in,4.09in)

       The resulting format string can be fed directly to pstops:

              > pstops `psdim --2up test.ps` test.ps test.2up.ps
              [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]
              [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
              Wrote 5 pages, 155746 bytes

EXIT STATUS
       On successful completion, 0 is returned, otherwise a positive error
       number.
