BRANDELF(1)             FreeBSD General Commands Manual            BRANDELF(1)

NAME
     brandelf – mark an ELF binary for a specific ABI

SYNOPSIS
     brandelf [-lv] [-f ELF_ABI_number] [-t string] file ...

DESCRIPTION
     The brandelf utility marks an ELF binary to be run under a certain ABI
     for FreeBSD.

     The options are as follows:

     -f ELF_ABI_number
             Forces branding with the supplied ELF ABI number.  Incompatible
             with the -t option.  These values are assigned by SCO/USL.

     -l      Writes the list of all known ELF types to the standard error.

     -v      Turns on verbose output.

     -t string
             Brands the given ELF binaries to be of the string ABI type.
             Currently supported ABIs are “FreeBSD”, “Linux”, and “SVR4”.

     file    If -t string is given it will brand file to be of type string,
             otherwise it will simply display the branding of file.

EXIT STATUS
     Exit status is 0 on success, and 1 if the command fails if a file does
     not exist, is too short, fails to brand properly, or the brand requested
     is not one of the known types and the -f option is not set.

EXAMPLES
     The following is an example of a typical usage of the brandelf command:

           brandelf file
           brandelf -t Linux file
