NAME
       String::Scanf - emulate sscanf() of the C library

SYNOPSIS
           use String::Scanf; # imports sscanf()

           ($a, $b, $c, $d) = sscanf("%d+%d %f-%s", $input);
           ($e, $f, $g, $h) = sscanf("%x %o %s:%3c"); # input defaults to $_

           $r = String::Scanf::format_to_re($f);

       or

           # works only for Perl 5.005 or later
           use String::Scanf qw(); # import nothing

           my $s1 = String::Scanf->new("%d+%d %f-%s");
           my $s2 = String::Scanf->new("%x %o %s:%3c");

           ($a, $b, $c, $d) = $s1->sscanf($input);
           ($e, $f, $g, $h) = $s2->sscanf(); # input defaults to $_

DESCRIPTION
       String::Scanf supports scanning strings for data using formats similar
       to the libc/stdio sscanf().

       The supported sscanf() formats are as follows:

       %d  Decimal integer, with optional plus or minus sign.

       %u  Decimal unsigned integer, with optional plus sign.

       %x  Hexadecimal unsigned integer, with optional "0x" or "0x" in front.

       %o  Octal unsigned integer.

       %e %f %g
           (The [efg] work identically.)

           Decimal floating point number, with optional plus or minus sign, in
           any of these formats:

               1
               1.
               1.23
               .23
               1e45
               1.e45
               1.23e45
               .23e45

           The exponent has an optional plus or minus sign, and the "e" may
           also be "E".

           The various borderline cases like "Inf" and "Nan" are not
           recognized.

       %s  A non-whitespace string.

       %c  A string of characters.  An array reference is returned containing
           the numerical values of the characters.

       %%  A literal "%".

       The sscanf() formats [pnSC] are not supported.

       The %s and %c have an optional maximum width, e.g. %4s, in which case
       at most so many characters are consumed (but fewer characters are also
       accecpted).

       The numeric formats may also have such a width but it is ignored.

       The numeric formats may have "[hl]" before the main option, e.g. %hd,
       but since such widths have no meaning in Perl, they are ignored.

       Non-format parts of the parameter string are matched literally (e.g.
       ":" matches as ":"), expect that any whitespace is matched as any
       whitespace (e.g. " " matches as "\s+").

WARNING
       The numeric formats match only something that looks like a number, they
       do not care whether it fits into the numbers of Perl.  In other words,
       123e456789 is valid for sscanf(), but quite probably it won't fit into
       your Perl's numbers.  Consider using the various Math::* modules
       instead.
