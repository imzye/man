NAME
       DHL - Perl module for the DHL online tracking service.

SYNOPSIS
         my $dhl = DHL->new(ID => 12345);
         print Dumper $dhl->status();
         ...

DESCRIPTION
       This module allows you to check the status of YOUR shipments via the
       DHL website. For privacy issues please consider the website.  Please
       note: This module is still some kind of alpha, because there are many
       different pages on the DHL website and they are changing constantly.

METHODS
       DHL->new()
           Obligatory method to create the DHL object. You must pass a valid
           ID for your shipment.

       $dhl->status()
           This method will try to fetch the status from the website. If there
           is an error, it will return undef and set $@. Otherwise you will
           get a hashref containing the summary and history of your shipment.

BUGS
       Please contact the author, if you find any in this code.
