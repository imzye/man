SGE(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 SGE(4)

NAME
     sge – Silicon Integrated Systems SiS190/191 Fast/Gigabit Ethernet driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device miibus
           device sge

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_sge_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The sge device driver provides support for SiS190 Fast Ethernet
     controllers and SiS191 Fast/Gigabit Ethernet controllers.

     All LOMs supported by the sge driver have TCP/UDP/IP checksum offload for
     transmit and receive, TCP segmentation offload (TSO), hardware VLAN tag
     stripping/insertion features.  Due to lack of documentation Wake On Lan
     (WOL), Jumbo frame and an interrupt moderation mechanism are not
     supported yet.

     The sge driver supports the following media types:

     autoselect       Enable autoselection of the media type and options.  The
                      user can manually override the autoselected mode by
                      adding media options to rc.conf(5).

     10baseT/UTP      Set 10Mbps operation.

     100baseTX        Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.

     1000baseTX       Set 1000baseTX operation over twisted pair.

     The sge driver supports the following media options:

     full-duplex      Force full duplex operation.

     half-duplex      Force half duplex operation.

     For more information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

HARDWARE
     The sge device driver provides support for the following Ethernet
     controllers:

     •   SiS190 Fast Ethernet controller
     •   SiS191 Fast/Gigabit Ethernet controller
