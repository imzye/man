       (1) This chip can be emulated via OPL Hardware (like Soundblaster sound
       cards).

       (2) OPL hardware emulation is available, but software emulation is
       prefered. Hardware emulation is used if another chip activates HW
       emulation or FMForce is True.  (3) You need a sample ROM, called
       yrw801.rom, to make playback work. Place it in the directory where
       vgmplay lies or in /usr/local/share/vgmplay/.

       OPL hardware emulation can be enabled by setting the "FMPort"-entry in
       the ini-file.  Under Linux the program must be run as root to use
       hardware FM.

       It's possible to write Wave files by editing the "LogSound"-line in the
       ini-file.  Batch conversions are possible by opening a playlist.  FM
       hardware cannot be logged to Wave files.

CONFIGURATION
       vgmplay is configured in the file vgmplay.ini, which should be located
       in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vgmplay (thus, by default
       ~/.config/vgmplay/vgmplay.ini).  A sample configuration
       /usr/local/share/examples/vgmplay/vgmplay.ini is available for copying
       and general reference.

BUGS
       PauseEmulation is disabled under Linux if no FM Hardware is used.

       You have to double-tap ESC to quit the program.

       Sometimes MAME's sound cores tend to sound strange.

COMMENTS
       The T6W28 doesn't use MAME's T6W28 core. Instead the SN76496 core is
       modified to emulate the T6W28 with 2 SN76496 chips.  The SN76496 OPL
       emulation is okay, but it's impossible to get the noise sound right.

       EMU2413 Emulator was added, because sometimes the one of MAME sounds
       strange.  The Gens YM2612 core was added for the same reason before
       MAME's YM2612 core was fixed.

AUTHORS
       This program was written by Valley Bell.

       Almost all software emulators are from MAME (http://mamedev.org)

       EMU2413 and Gens YM2612 were ported from Maxim's in_vgm

       The YMF278B core was ported from openMSX

       zlib compression by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler is used

       All custom OPL Mappers were written using MAME software emulators and
       the OPL2/3 programming guides by Jeffrey S. Lee and Vladimir Arnost

       one YM2413 OPL Mapper was ported from MEKA.

       The RF5C164 and PWM cores were ported from Gens/GS

       The MAME YM2612 core was fixed with the help of Blargg's MAME YM2612
       fix and Genesis Plus GX' YM2612 core

       AdLibEmu (OPL2 and OPL3 core) was ported from DOSBox

       The default HuC6280 core is from Ootake.

       EMU2149, the alternative NES APU core and the NES FDS core were ported
       from rainwarrior's NSFPlay.
