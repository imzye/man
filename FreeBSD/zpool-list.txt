ZPOOL-LIST(8)           FreeBSD System Manager's Manual          ZPOOL-LIST(8)

NAME
     zpool-list – list information about ZFS storage pools

SYNOPSIS
     zpool list [-HgLpPv] [-o property[,property]…] [-T u|d] [pool]…
           [interval [count]]

DESCRIPTION
     Lists the given pools along with a health status and space usage.  If no
     pools are specified, all pools in the system are listed.  When given an
     interval, the information is printed every interval seconds until killed.
     If count is specified, the command exits after count reports are printed.

     -g      Display vdev GUIDs instead of the normal device names.  These
             GUIDs can be used in place of device names for the zpool
             detach/offline/remove/replace commands.

     -H      Scripted mode.  Do not display headers, and separate fields by a
             single tab instead of arbitrary space.

     -o property
             Comma-separated list of properties to display.  See the
             zpoolprops(7) manual page for a list of valid properties.  The
             default list is name, size, allocated, free, checkpoint,
             expandsize, fragmentation, capacity, dedupratio, health, altroot.

     -L      Display real paths for vdevs resolving all symbolic links.  This
             can be used to look up the current block device name regardless
             of the /dev/disk path used to open it.

     -p      Display numbers in parsable (exact) values.

     -P      Display full paths for vdevs instead of only the last component
             of the path.  This can be used in conjunction with the -L flag.

     -T u|d  Display a time stamp.  Specify u for a printed representation of
             the internal representation of time.  See time(2).  Specify d for
             standard date format.  See date(1).

     -v      Verbose statistics.  Reports usage statistics for individual
             vdevs within the pool, in addition to the pool-wide statistics.
