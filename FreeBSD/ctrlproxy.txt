NAME
       ctrlproxy - a modular IRC proxy with multi-server support

SYNOPSIS
       ctrlproxy [-d file] [-l file] [-D] [--init] [-r file] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       ctrlproxy is a modular IRC proxy. It connects to a number of IRC
       servers and then passes data it receives on to the modules that have
       been loaded into it. Current modules are client_simple (for proxy
       support) and log (for irssi-style log file generation).

       By default, ctrlproxy listens for client connections on port 6668 and
       any ports after that one, depending on the number of servers it is
       connected to.

OPTIONS
       ctrlproxy recognizes the following command-line options

       -i, --inetd-client=NETWORK
           Add incoming client on stdin/stdout, connected to the specified
           network. This can be used for inetd-like communication and testing.

       -d, --debugfile=FILE
           Dump IRC traffic to specified file. Only useful for debugging
           purposes.

       -D, --daemon
           Go to the background after the program has been started (daemon
           mode).

       -c, --config-dir=DIR
           Read configuration files from the specified directory DIR instead
           of from .ctrlproxy in the users´ homedirectory.

       --init
           Create a new configuration file.

       -v, --version
           Show copyright and version information

           Show help message with short argument information

       -l, --log=FILE
           Log ctrlproxy messages to specified file.
