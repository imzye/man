FUNCTIONS
   LDAPhash ( mesg )
       This takes from a search and turns it into a hash.

       The returned has is in the following format.

               {DN}{ldap}{attribute}[array of values for this attribute]

       The reason for the {ldap} is to allow for other values and the like to
       be tagged onto a hash for a DN that are unrelated to LDAP.

       This function does not make any attempt to check if the search
       succedded or not.
