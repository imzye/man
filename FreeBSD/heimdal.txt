AFSLOG(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              AFSLOG(1)

NAME
     afslog – obtain AFS tokens

SYNOPSIS
     afslog [-h | --help] [--no-v5] [-u | --unlog] [-v | --verbose]
            [--version] [-c cell | --cell=cell] [-k realm | --realm=realm]
            [-P principal | --principal=principal] [-p path | --file=path]
            [cell | path ...]

DESCRIPTION
     afslog obtains AFS tokens for a number of cells. What cells to get tokens
     for can either be specified as an explicit list, as file paths to get
     tokens for, or be left unspecified, in which case afslog will use
     whatever magic krb_afslog(3) decides upon.

     Supported options:

     --no-v5
             This makes afslog not try using Kerberos 5.

     -P principal, --principal principal
             select what Kerberos 5 principal to use.

     --cache cache
             select what Kerberos 5 credential cache to use.  --principal
             overrides this option.

     -u, --unlog
             Destroy tokens instead of obtaining new. If this is specified,
             all other options are ignored (except for --help and --version).

     -v, --verbose
             Adds more verbosity for what is actually going on.

     -c cell, --cell=cell
             This specified one or more cell names to get tokens for.

     -k realm, --realm=realm
             This is the Kerberos realm the AFS servers live in, this should
             normally not be specified.

     -p path, --file=path
             This specified one or more file paths for which tokens should be
             obtained.

     Instead of using -c and -p, you may also pass a list of cells and file
     paths after any other options. These arguments are considered files if
     they are either the strings “.” or “..” or they contain a slash, or if
     there exists a file by that name.

EXAMPLES
     Assuming that there is no file called “openafs.org” in the current
     directory, and that /afs/openafs.org points to that cell, the follwing
     should be identical:

           $ afslog -c openafs.org
           $ afslog openafs.org
           $ afslog /afs/openafs.org/some/file
