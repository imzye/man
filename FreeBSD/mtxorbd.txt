mtxorbd(1)                 Matrix Orbital LCD Daemon                mtxorbd(1)

NAME
       mtxorbd - Control a matrix orbital lcd screen

SYNOPSIS
       mtxorbd

DESCRIPTION
       mtxorbd listens on /tmp/lcd and relays commands to the lcd screen.
       This is a very thin wrapper around the actual LCD commands, and just
       provides a user friendly view of the commands (in other words, text
       based).

       The daemon runs on a very simple protocol, which is described below.
       All lines must end with a new line, but not a carriage return (unix
       line ending).  All parse errors are currently ignored (you will not
       know if something didn't go through except that the screen didn't
       update).
