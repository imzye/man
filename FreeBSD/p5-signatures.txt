NAME
       signatures - Subroutine signatures with no source filter

VERSION
       version 0.14

SYNOPSIS
           use signatures;

           sub foo ($bar, $baz) {
               return $bar + $baz;
           }

DESCRIPTION
       With this module, we can specify subroutine signatures and have
       variables automatically defined within the subroutine.

       For example, you can write

           sub square ($num) {
               return $num * $num;
           }

       and it will be automatically turned into the following at compile time:

           sub square {
               my ($num) = @_;
               return $num * $num;
           }

       Note that, although the syntax is very similar, the signatures provided
       by this module are not to be confused with the prototypes described in
       perlsub. All this module does is extracting items of @_ and assigning
       them to the variables in the parameter list. No argument validation is
       done at runtime.

       The signature definition needs to be on a single line only.

       If you want to combine sub signatures with regular prototypes a "proto"
       attribute exists:

           sub foo ($bar, $baz) : proto($$) { ... }

METHODS
       If you want subroutine signatures doing something that this module
       doesn't provide, like argument validation, typechecking and similar,
       you can subclass it and override the following methods.

   proto_unwrap ($prototype)
       Turns the extracted $prototype into code.

       The default implementation returns "my (${prototype}) = @_;" or an
       empty string, if no prototype is given.

   inject ($offset, $code)
       Inserts a $code string into the line perl currently parses at the given
       $offset. This is only called by the "callback" method.

   callback ($offset, $prototype)
       This gets called as soon as a sub definition with a prototype is
       encountered. Arguments are the $offset within the current line perl is
       parsing and extracted $prototype.

       The default implementation calls "proto_unwrap" with the prototype and
       passes the returned value and the offset to "inject".

LIMITATIONS
       prototypes aren't checked for validity yet
           You won't get a warning for invalid prototypes using the "proto"
           attribute, like you normally would with warnings enabled.

       you shouldn't alter $SIG{__WARN__} at compile time
           After this module is loaded you shouldn't make any changes to
           $SIG{__WARN__} during compile time. Changing it before the module
           is loaded or at runtime is fine.
