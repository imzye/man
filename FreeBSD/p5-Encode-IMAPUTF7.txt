NAME
       Encode::IMAPUTF7 - modification of UTF-7 encoding for IMAP

VERSION
       version 1.07

SYNOPSIS
           use Encode qw/encode decode/;
           use Encode::IMAPUTF7;

           print encode('IMAP-UTF-7', 'Répertoire');
           print decode('IMAP-UTF-7', 'R&AOk-pertoire');

PERL VERSION
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It
       should work on any version of perl released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made
       that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version
       may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

ABSTRACT
       IMAP mailbox names are encoded in a modified UTF-7 when names contains
       international characters outside of the printable ASCII range. The
       modified UTF-7 encoding is defined in RFC2060 (section 5.1.3).

   RFC2060 - section 5.1.3 - Mailbox International Naming Convention
       By convention, international mailbox names are specified using a
       modified version of the UTF-7 encoding described in [UTF-7].  The
       purpose of these modifications is to correct the following problems
       with UTF-7:

       1.  UTF-7 uses the "+" character for shifting; this conflicts with the
           common use of "+" in mailbox names, in particular USENET newsgroup
           names.

       2.  UTF-7's encoding is BASE64 which uses the "/" character; this
           conflicts with the use of "/" as a popular hierarchy delimiter.

       3.  UTF-7 prohibits the unencoded usage of "\"; this conflicts with the
           use of "\" as a popular hierarchy delimiter.

       4.  UTF-7 prohibits the unencoded usage of "~"; this conflicts with the
           use of "~" in some servers as a home directory indicator.

       5.  UTF-7 permits multiple alternate forms to represent the same
           string; in particular, printable US-ASCII chararacters can be
           represented in encoded form.

       In modified UTF-7, printable US-ASCII characters except for "&"
       represent themselves; that is, characters with octet values 0x20-0x25
       and 0x27-0x7e.  The character "&" (0x26) is represented by the two-
       octet sequence "&-".

       All other characters (octet values 0x00-0x1f, 0x7f-0xff, and all
       Unicode 16-bit octets) are represented in modified BASE64, with a
       further modification from [UTF-7] that "," is used instead of "/".
       Modified BASE64 MUST NOT be used to represent any printing US-ASCII
       character which can represent itself.

       "&" is used to shift to modified BASE64 and "-" to shift back to US-
       ASCII.  All names start in US-ASCII, and MUST end in US-ASCII (that is,
       a name that ends with a Unicode 16-bit octet MUST end with a "- ").

       For example, here is a mailbox name which mixes English, Japanese, and
       Chinese text: "~peter/mail/&ZeVnLIqe-/&U,BTFw-"
