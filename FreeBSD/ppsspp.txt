PPSSPP(1)                        User Commands                       PPSSPP(1)





NAME
       PPSSPP - PSP emulator.


SYNOPSIS
       ppsspp [FILE] [OPTIONS]...


DESCRIPTION
       PPSSPP is a PSP emulator written in C++. It translates PSP CPU
       instructions directly into optimized x86, x64 and ARM machine code,
       using JIT recompilers (dynarecs).  It can thus run on quite low-spec
       hardware, including stronger ARM-based phones and tablets, as long as
       there's OpenGL ES 2.0 support.

       It can run your PSP games in full HD resolution and it can even upscale
       textures that would otherwise be too blurry as they were made for the
       small screen of the original PSP.

       See http://www.ppsspp.org/ for more information.
