IOGRAPH(8)          FreeBSD System Manager's Manual (local)         IOGRAPH(8)

NAME
     iograph – create HTML graphs showing network traffic

SYNOPSIS
     iograph [-i interface] [-o outdir] [-d datafile]

DESCRIPTION
     The iograph program collects network statistics for an interface of the
     local host and stores the number of sent and received bytes in a small
     binary database.

     It then creates HTML pages printing the statistics for one day (hourly
     display), one month (daily display) or for the past twelve month. The
     HTML pages print the number of bytes sent / received together with a bar
     graph.

   Options
     -i interface
             The network interface for which statistics are to be collected.

     -o outdir
             Directory where to place the resulting HTML pages.
             Do not add a trailing slash!

     -d datafile
             Name of the database file.

   Usage
     iograph is intended to be run as a cron job. Add the following line to
     your system crontab(8):

           0 * * * * root /usr/local/bin/iograph -i ath0 -o
           /usr/local/www/iograph -d /var/db/iograph.dat

BUGS
     The intended interval is one hour. If it is called more than once an
     hour, the data point for the past hour is overwritten with the traffic
     since the last run.

     On i386 systems, FreeBSD's network counters are 32 bit long, therefore
     wrapping at 4 GB.  iograph will produce wrong results if more than 4 GB
     are transfered within one hour, because it can only detect one counter
     wrap.
