DESCRIPTION
       Curses-based CW signal generator. F1 shows help in interactive mode. In
       batch mode (--noplay), senerates 1-5 mixed CW signals of various
       properties, adds optional noise and saves it to a WAV file. If compiled
       on proper environment, it can play the result. Command line parameters
       are also interpreted in interactive mode!

       In batch mode all text output is written to stderr; if stdout is
       redirected, the created file is written here. If stdin is redirected,
       the generated text is taken from it.

       Optional CWPARAM environment variable can be set to hold some
       parameters, for example CWPARAM="--even 10 --odd 10".

OPTIONS
       --play --noplay
              Play the result (default), otherwise only save the WAV file.

       --silent --verbose
              Verbose mode gives full output (default), silent mode presents
              only generated text.

       --groups --words --calls
              The "groups" mode generates random five-letter groups. The
              "words" mode generates most common English words. The "calls"
              mode generates real amateur callsigns.

       --agc 0-100
              Simulate AGC response of receiver by varying noise volume along
              RMS of the signal. Default is 100.

       --bits bits
              Set bitrate. Default is 16.

       --click 0-100
              Simulate click by lowering sustain part of tone at given level
              (in dB) below attack phase. Default is 1 dB.

       --chars nchars
              Take first "nchars" from default charset in "groups" mode.

       --charset charset
              Set customized charset for random group generation in "groups"
              mode.

       --cspaces 0-100
              Set additional spaces (one space has a length of a dot) between
              chars. Default is 0.

       --dashlen 100-1000
              Length of dash, in percentage of dot. Default is 300% (3:1).

       --detune 0-100
              Simulate frequency drift of the signal. Default is 0.

       --even 0-100
              Enhance the signal by given percent of even harmonics. Default
              is 0. Values 0-5 are most valuable in practice.

       --freq 50-4000
              Use given frequency in Hz..

       --number 1-100
              Generate given number of groups/words/calls. Default is 20.

       --hand 0-100
              Simulate hand transmitting by introduce random errors in
              dash/dot lengths.

       --highcut 300-10000
              Set high cutoff frequency (Hz) of generated noise. Default is
              2400.

       --hum 0-100
              Add given percentage of 50 Hz mains hum. Default is 0.

       --lowcut 50-1000
              Set low cutoff frequency (Hz) of generated noise. Default is
              300.

       --noise 0-100
              Add given percentage of noise. Default is 100.

       --odd odd
              Enhance the signal by given percent of odd harmonics. Default is
              0. Values 0-5 are most valuable in practice.

       --output outfile
              Store the result in a WAV file of given name. Default is
              output.wav.

       --qsb 0-100
              Add given amount of signal QSB. Default is 0.

       --samplerate samplerate
              Set given samplerate. Default is 44100.

       --seed 0-32767
              Set explicitly the seed of random generator. If not set or set
              to 0, seed is also random generated. Otherwise it is set to
              given value, resulting in a possibility of repetitive random
              content generation.

       --shape -50 - +50
              Set the shape of random generated numbers. Positive value
              increases the fraction of higher numbers (last letters, words,
              calls). Negative values prefer first ones. Zero means flat
              uniform distribution.  Can be used to increase the number of
              newly learned letters/words. In practice, values -10 to 10 are
              well working.

       --signals 1-5
              Generate given number of mixed signals, each of hardcoded
              frequency ratio, tempo ratio and amplitude ratio. Every signal
              plays the same text in a loop. Default is 3.

       --spacelen 20-300
              Space length (between dots and dashes) in percentage of dot.
              Default is 100% (1:1).

       --sweep -4000 - 4000
              Simulate sweep (chirp or filter ringing according to parameters)
              by starting each tone from given frequency (can be negative,
              which results in zero crossing). Frequency is then changed
              exponentially to this given in --freq with a rate given by
              --sweepness. Default is 0.

       --sweepness 0-10000
              The rate of exponential frequency change from --sweep to --freq.
              Default is 0 (no sweep).

       --tempo 5-500
              Tempo of generated main signal in cpm (chars per minute)
              according to PARIS group.

       --window 0-1000
              Raised cosine window width (used to avoid clicks in each tone).
              Default is 100 samples.

       --wordset 0-1000
              Take only first given number of most common English words in
              "words" mode.

       --wspaces 0-100
              Set additional spaces between words/groups/calls. Default is
              zero.

EXIT STATUS
       CWStudio returns 0 if everything is OK. In the case of error, return
       value is different.
