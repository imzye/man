NAME
       RDF::Trine - An RDF Framework for Perl

VERSION
       This document describes RDF::Trine version 1.019

SYNOPSIS
         use RDF::Trine;

         my $store = RDF::Trine::Store::Memory->new();
         my $model = RDF::Trine::Model->new($store);

         # parse some web data into the model, and print the count of resulting RDF statements
         RDF::Trine::Parser->parse_url_into_model( 'http://kasei.us/about/foaf.xrdf', $model );
         print $model->size . " RDF statements parsed\n";

         # Create a namespace object for the foaf vocabulary
         my $foaf = RDF::Trine::Namespace->new( 'http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/' );

         # Create a node object for the FOAF name property
         my $pred = $foaf->name;
         # alternatively:
         # my $pred = RDF::Trine::Node::Resource->new('http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name');

         # Create an iterator for all the statements in the model with foaf:name as the predicate
         my $iter = $model->get_statements(undef, $pred, undef);

         # Now print the results
         print "Names of things:\n";
         while (my $st = $iter->next) {
           my $s = $st->subject;
           my $name = $st->object;

           # $s and $name have string overloading, so will print correctly
           print "The name of $s is $name\n";
         }

DESCRIPTION
       RDF::Trine provides an Resource Descriptive Framework (RDF) with an
       emphasis on extensibility, API stability, and the presence of a test
       suite. The package consists of several components:

       •   RDF::Trine::Model - RDF model providing access to a triple store.
           This module would typically be used to access an existing store by
           a developer looking to "Just get stuff done."

       •   RDF::Trine::Parser - RDF parsers for various serialization formats
           including RDF/XML, Turtle, RDFa, and RDF/JSON.

       •   RDF::Trine::Store::Memory - An in-memory, non-persistant triple
           store. Typically used for temporary data.

       •   RDF::Trine::Store::DBI - A triple store for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and
           SQLite, based on the relational schema used by Redland. Typically
           used to for large, persistent data.

       •   RDF::Trine::Iterator - Iterator classes for variable bindings and
           RDF statements, used by RDF::Trine::Store, RDF::Trine::Model, and
           RDF::Query.

       •   RDF::Trine::Namespace - A convenience class for easily constructing
           RDF::Trine::Node::Resource objects from URI namespaces.

FUNCTIONS
       "iri ( $iri )"
           Returns a RDF::Trine::Node::Resource object with the given IRI
           value.

       "blank ( $id )"
           Returns a RDF::Trine::Node::Blank object with the given identifier.

       "literal ( $value, $lang, $dt )"
           Returns a RDF::Trine::Node::Literal object with the given value and
           optional language/datatype.

       "variable ( $name )"
           Returns a RDF::Trine::Node::Variable object with the given variable
           name.

       "statement ( @nodes )"
           Returns a RDF::Trine::Statement object with the supplied node
           objects.

       "store ( $config )"
           Returns a RDF::Trine::Store object based on the supplied
           configuration string.

       "default_useragent ( [ $ua ] )"
           Returns the LWP::UserAgent object used by default for any operation
           requiring network requests. Ordinarily, the calling code will
           obtain the default user agent, and clone it before further
           configuring it for a specific request, thus leaving the default
           object untouched.

           If $ua is passed as an argument, sets the global default user agent
           to this object.
