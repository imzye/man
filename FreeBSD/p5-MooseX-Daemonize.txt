NAME
       MooseX::Daemonize - Role for daemonizing your Moose based application

VERSION
       version 0.22

SYNOPSIS
           package My::Daemon;
           use Moose;

           with qw(MooseX::Daemonize);

           # ... define your class ....

           after start => sub {
               my $self = shift;
               return unless $self->is_daemon;
               # your daemon code here ...
           };

           # then in your script ...

           my $daemon = My::Daemon->new_with_options();

           my ($command) = @{$daemon->extra_argv}
           defined $command || die "No command specified";

           $daemon->start   if $command eq 'start';
           $daemon->status  if $command eq 'status';
           $daemon->restart if $command eq 'restart';
           $daemon->stop    if $command eq 'stop';

           warn($daemon->status_message);
           exit($daemon->exit_code);

DESCRIPTION
       Often you want to write a persistent daemon that has a pid file, and
       responds appropriately to Signals. This module provides a set of basic
       roles as an infrastructure to do that.

WARNING
       The maintainers of this module now recommend using Daemon::Control
       instead.

CAVEATS
       When going into background MooseX::Daemonize closes all open file
       handles. This may interfere with you logging because it may also close
       the log file handle you want to write to. To prevent this you can
       either defer opening the log file until after start. Alternatively, use
       can use the 'dont_close_all_files' option either from the command line
       or in your .sh script.

       Assuming you want to use Log::Log4perl for example you could expand the
       MooseX::Daemonize example above like this.

           after start => sub {
               my $self = shift;
               return unless $self->is_daemon;
               Log::Log4perl->init(\$log4perl_config);
               my $logger = Log::Log4perl->get_logger();
               $logger->info("Daemon started");
               # your daemon code here ...
           };

ATTRIBUTES
       This list includes attributes brought in from other roles as well we
       include them here for ease of documentation. All of these attributes
       are settable though MooseX::Getopt's command line handling, with the
       exception of "is_daemon".

       progname Path::Class::Dir | Str
           The name of our daemon, defaults to "$package_name =~ s/::/_/";

       pidbase Path::Class::Dir | Str
           The base for our PID, defaults to "/var/run/"

       basedir Path::Class::Dir | Str
           The directory we chdir to; defaults to "/".

       pidfile MooseX::Daemonize::Pid::File | Str
           The file we store our PID in, defaults to "$pidbase/$progname.pid"

       foreground Bool
           If true, the process won't background. Useful for debugging. This
           option can be set via Getopt's -f.

       no_double_fork Bool
           If true, the process will not perform the typical double-fork,
           which is extra added protection from your process accidentally
           acquiring a controlling terminal.  More information can be found by
           Googling "double fork daemonize".

       ignore_zombies Bool
           If true, the process will not clean up zombie processes.  Normally
           you don't want this.

       dont_close_all_files Bool
           If true, the objects open filehandles will not be closed when
           daemonized.  Normally you don't want this.

       is_daemon Bool
           If true, the process is the backgrounded daemon process, if false
           it is the parent process. This is useful for example in an "after
           'start' =" sub { }> block.

           NOTE: This option is explicitly not available through
           MooseX::Getopt.

       stop_timeout
           Number of seconds to wait for the process to stop, before trying
           harder to kill it. Defaults to 2 seconds.

       These are the internal attributes, which are not available through
       MooseX::Getopt.

       exit_code Int
       status_message Str

METHODS
   Daemon Control Methods
       These methods can be used to control the daemon behavior. Every effort
       has been made to have these methods DWIM (Do What I Mean), so that you
       can focus on just writing the code for your daemon.

       Extending these methods is best done with the Moose method modifiers,
       such as "before", "after" and "around".

       start
           Setup a pidfile, fork, then setup the signal handlers.

       stop
           Stop the process matching the pidfile, and unlinks the pidfile.

       restart
           Literally this is:

               $self->stop();
               $self->start();

       status
       shutdown

   Pidfile Handling Methods
       init_pidfile
           This method will create a MooseX::Daemonize::Pid::File object and
           tell it to store the PID in the file "$pidbase/$progname.pid".

       check
           This checks to see if the daemon process is currently running by
           checking the pidfile.

       get_pid
           Returns the PID of the daemon process.

       save_pid
           Write the pidfile.

       remove_pid
           Removes the pidfile.

   Signal Handling Methods
       setup_signals
           Setup the signal handlers, by default it only sets up handlers for
           SIGINT and SIGHUP. If you wish to add more signals just use the
           "after" method modifier and add them.

       handle_sigint
           Handle a INT signal, by default calls "$self-"stop()>

       handle_sighup
           Handle a HUP signal. By default calls "$self-"restart()>

   Exit Code Methods
       These are overridable constant methods used for setting the exit code.

       OK  Returns 0.

       ERROR
           Returns 1.

   Introspection
       meta()
           The meta() method from Class::MOP::Class

DEPENDENCIES
       Moose, MooseX::Getopt, MooseX::Types::Path::Class and POSIX

INCOMPATIBILITIES
       Obviously this will not work on Windows.
