DESCRIPTION
       SRG is a log analyser for the Squid web proxy. SRG takes input in the
       form of Squid access logs and outputs a series of reports in PHP (or
       HTML) format designed to summarise what the users of the cache have
       been viewing. SRG supports grouping requests by user, subnet or IP and
       can also filter on the same criteria.
