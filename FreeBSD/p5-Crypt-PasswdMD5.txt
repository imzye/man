NAME
       Crypt::PasswdMD5 - Provide interoperable MD5-based crypt() functions

SYNOPSIS
               use strict;
               use warnings;

               use Crypt::PasswdMD5;

               my($password)       = 'seekrit';
               my($salt)           = 'pepperoni';
               my($unix_crypted)   = unix_md5_crypt($password, $salt);
               my($apache_crypted) = apache_md5_crypt($password, $salt);

               Or:

               use strict;
               use warnings;

               use Crypt::PasswdMD5 'random_md5_salt';

               my($length) = 7;
               my($salt_1) = random_md5_salt($length);
               my($salt_2) = random_md5_salt(); # Default to $length == 8.

DESCRIPTION
       apache_md5_crypt() provides a function compatible with Apache's
       ".htpasswd" files.  This was contributed by Bryan Hart <bryan@eai.com>.
       This function is exported by default.

       The unix_md5_crypt() provides a crypt()-compatible interface to the
       rather new MD5-based crypt() function found in modern operating
       systems. It's based on the implementation found on FreeBSD
       2.2.[56]-RELEASE.  This function is also exported by default.

       For both functions, if a salt value is not supplied, a random salt will
       be generated, using the function random_md5_salt().  This function is
       not exported by default.

METHODS
   apache_md5_crypt($password, $salt)
       This sets a magic variable, and then passes all the calling parameters
       to "unix_md5_crypt($password, $salt)".

       Returns an encrypted version of the given password.

       Basically, it's a very poor choice for anything other than password
       authentication.

   random_md5_salt([$length])
       Here, [] indicate an optional parameter.

       Returns a random salt of the given length.

       The maximum length is 8.

       If $length is omitted, it defaults to 8.

   unix_md5_crypt($password, $salt)
       Returns an encrypted version of the given password.

       Basically, it's a very poor choice for anything other than password
       authentication.
