NAME
       B::Hooks::Parser - Interface to perl's parser variables

VERSION
       version 0.21

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides an API for parts of the perl parser. It can be
       used to modify code while it's being parsed.

Perl API
   setup()
       Does some initialization work. This must be called before any other
       functions of this module if you intend to use "set_linestr". Returns an
       id that can be used to disable the magic using "teardown".

   teardown($id)
       Disables magic registered using "setup".

   get_linestr()
       Returns the line the parser is currently working on, or undef if perl
       isn't parsing anything right now.

   get_linestr_offset()
       Returns the position within the current line to which perl has already
       parsed the input, or -1 if nothing is being parsed currently.

   set_linestr($string)
       Sets the line the perl parser is currently working on to $string.

       Note that perl won't notice any changes in the line string after the
       position returned by "get_linestr_offset".

       Throws an exception when nothing is being compiled.

   inject($string)
       Convenience function to insert a piece of perl code into the current
       line string (as returned by "get_linestr") at the current offset (as
       returned by "get_linestr_offset").

   get_lex_stuff()
       Returns the string of additional stuff resulting from recent lexing
       that is being held onto by the lexer.  For example, the content of a
       quoted string goes here.  Returns "undef" if there is no such stuff.

   clear_lex_stuff()
       Discard the string of additional stuff resulting from recent lexing
       that is being held onto by the lexer.

C API
       The following functions work just like their equivalent in the Perl
       API, except that they can't handle embedded "NUL" bytes in strings.

   "hook_op_check_id hook_parser_setup (void)"
       Note: may be implemented as a macro.

   "void hook_parser_teardown (hook_op_check_id id)"
   "const char *hook_parser_get_linestr (pTHX)"
   "IV hook_parser_get_linestr_offset (pTHX)"
   "void hook_parser_set_linestr (pTHX_ const char *new_value)"
   "char *hook_parser_get_lex_stuff (pTHX)"
   "void hook_parser_clear_lex_stuff (pTHX)"
