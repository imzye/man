NAME
       Pod::Stripper - strip all pod, and output what's left

SYNOPSIS
           $>perl Stripper.pm

       or

           #!/usr/bin/perl -w

           use strict;
           use Pod::Stripper;

           my $Stripper = new Pod::Stripper();

           $Stripper->parse_from_filehandle(\*STDIN) unless (@ARGV);

           for my $ARGV (@ARGV) {
               $Stripper->parse_from_file($ARGV);
           }

DESCRIPTION
       This be "Pod::Stripper", a subclass of "Pod::Parser".  It parses perl
       files, stripping out the pod, and dumping the rest (presumably code) to
       wherever you point it to (like you do with "Pod::Parser").

       You could probably subclass it, but I don't see why.

   MOTIVATION
       I basically re-wrote "Pod::Stripper" on two separate occasions, and I
       know at least 2 other people who'd use it, and thought It'd make a nice
       addition.

       "perl -MPod::Stripper -e"Pod::Stripper->new()->parse_from_file(shift)""
       "  Stripper.pm"

   EXPORTS
       None.  This one be object oriented (at least I'm under the impression
       that it is).

   SEE ALSO
       "Pod::Parser" and Pod::Parser, esp. the "input_*" and "output_*"
       methods

CAVEAT
       This module will correctly strip out get rid of hidden pod, and
       preserve hiddencode, but like all pod parsers except "perl", it will be
       fooled by pod in heredocs (or things like that).

       see perlpod and read Stripper.pm for more information.

The Following is more interesting if you read Stripper.pm raw
TEST CASE FOLLOWS - NOT POD NOR CODE
       ==head2 HEY THIS POD TOO (REALLy, == is valid, although some parsers
       might disagree)

       podchecker will not complain

   ABTEST print "THIS IS HIDDEN POD";
   CUT
       had to make sure

   I AM INSIDE A HEREDOC
       WHERE ARE YOU?

   I AM HIDDEN POD INSIDE A HEREDOC warn "really, I am"
   BOO
       but hey, if the pod inside a heredoc gets eaten by a pod parser (as it
       shoulD) I see no problem here

   WELL IF THIS WASN'T AFTER "__END__" "this would still be hidden pod";
   THIS REALLY IS AN UGLY HACK
       yes, it is
