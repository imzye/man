TENTACLE_CLIENT(1)       Client file transfer protocol      TENTACLE_CLIENT(1)

NAME
       tentacle_client - a client file transfer protocol

SYNOPSIS
       tentacle_client <options> Tentacle is a client/server file transfer
       protocol that aims to be:

       -   Executable programs or shell commands
       -   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
       -   Library calls (functions within program libraries)

       Tentacle was created to replace more complex tools like SCP and FTP for
       simple file transfer/retrieval, and switch from authentication
       mechanisms like .netrc, interactive logins and SSH keys to X.509
       certificates. Simple password authentication over a SSL secured
       connection is supported too.

       The client and server (TCP port 41121) are designed to be run from the
       command line or called from a shell script, and no configuration files
       are needed.

       Tentacle is now the default file transfer method for Pandora FMS and
       Babel Enterprise.

       Tentacle is implemented in Perl and ANSI C (Windows platforms
       included).

       You can download it and get more information at the official
       Sourceforge website http://tentacled.sourceforge.net/.
