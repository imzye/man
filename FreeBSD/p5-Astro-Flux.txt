NAME
       Astro::Flux - Class for handling astronomical flux quantities.

SYNOPSIS
         use Astro::Flux;

         $flux = new Astro::Flux( $quantity, $units, $waveband );

         $quantity = $flux->quantity('mag');

DESCRIPTION
       Class for handling astronomical flux quantities. This class does not
       currently support conversions from one flux type to another (say, from
       magnitudes to Janskies) but may in the future.

METHODS
   Constructor
       new Create a new instance of an "Astro::Flux" object.

             $flux = new Astro::Flux( $quantity, $type, $waveband );

           The first three parameters must be defined. They are:

             quantity - numerical value for the flux, my be a primitive, or a
                        C<Number::Uncertainty> object.
             type - type of flux. Can be any string.
             waveband - waveband for the given flux. Must be an C<Astro::WaveBand> object.

           If any of the parameters are undefined, the constructor will throw
           an error. If the waveband parameter is not an "Astro::WaveBand"
           object, the constructor will throw an error.

           The type is case-insensitive for lookups using the "quantity"
           method.

           A fourth optional argument may be passed; this is a hash containing
           the following optional keys:

             quality - an C<Misc::Quality> object denoting quality flags for the
               C<Astro::Flux> object.
             reference_waveband - an C<Astro::WaveBand> object denoting a reference
               waveband for the C<Astro::Flux> object. This is used for determining
               magnitudes when deriving them from C<Astro::FluxColor> objects. See
               C<Astro::Fluxes>.
             datetime - an C<DateTime> object which is the datetime of observation for the
               measurement in the C<Astro::Flux> object.
             obsid - An array reference to a list of observation identifiers. Can be
               used to identify the observation(s) from which this measurement was
               taken (e.g. from a filename).

   Accessor Methods
       quantity
           Returns the quantity for a requested flux type.

             my $mag = $flux->quantity('mag');

           No conversions are done between types. What you put in via the
           constructor is all you can get out, so if you specify the type to
           be 'magnitude' and you ask for a 'mag', this method will throw an
           error.

           The type is case-insensitive.

       error
           Returns the error in the quantity for a requested flux type.

             my $mag = $flux->error('mag');

           No conversions are done between types. What you put in via the
           constructor is all you can get out, so if you specify the type to
           be 'magnitude' and you ask for a 'mag', this method will throw an
           error.

           The type is case-insensitive.

           Errors are only returned if one was created with the object.

       waveband
           Returns the waveband for the given flux object.

             my $waveband = $flux->waveband;

           Returns an "Astro::WaveBand" object.

       quality
           Returns the quality for the given flux object.

             my $quality = $flux->quality;

           Returns an "Misc::Quality" object if defined. If not, returns
           undef.

       reference_waveband
           Returns the reference waveband for the given flux object.

             my $ref_waveband = $flux->reference_waveband;

           Returns an "Astro::WaveBand" object if defined. If not, returns
           undef.

       datetime
           Sets or returns the datetime stamp for the given flux object.

             my $datetime = $flux->datetime;
             $flux->datetime( new DateTime );

           Returns an "Date::datetime" object if defined. If not, returns
           undef.

       obsid
           Sets or returns the observation ID for the given flux object.

             my $obsid = $flux->obsid;
             $flux->obsid( $obsid );

           Returns an array reference if defined. If not, returns undef.

       type
           Returns the type of flux measurement stored.

             my $type = $flux->type;

           Cannot be used to set the type.
