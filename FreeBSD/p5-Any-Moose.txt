Any::Moose(3)         User Contributed Perl Documentation        Any::Moose(3)


NAME
       Any::Moose - (DEPRECATED) use Moo instead!

VERSION
       version 0.27

DEPRECATION
       日本語翻訳: http://blog.64p.org/entry/2013/02/06/094906

       Please use Moo instead of Any::Moose for new code.

       Moo classes and roles will transparently and correctly upgrade to Moose
       when needed. This is a fundamentally better design than what Any::Moose
       offers. Mouse metaclasses do not interact with Moose metaclasses which
       leaks abstractions all over the place.

       Any::Moose had a good run. It was a simplistic but expedient answer for
       getting Moose syntax on the cheap but with the transparent upgrade path
       to Moose when you needed it. But really, please don't use it any more.
       :)

       You may find MooX::late useful for porting your code from Any::Moose to
       Moo.
