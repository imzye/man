NAME
       IO::Null -- class for null filehandles

SYNOPSIS
         use IO::Null;
         my $fh = IO::Null->new;
         print $fh "I have nothing to say\n";  # does nothing.
         # or:
         $fh->print("And I'm saying it.\n");   # ditto.
         # or:
         my $old = select($fh);
         print "and that is poetry / as I needed it --John Cage"; # nada!
         select($old);

       Or even:

         tie(*FOO, IO::Null);
         print FOO "Lalalalala!\n";  # does nothing.

DESCRIPTION
       This is a class for null filehandles.

       Calling a constructor of this class always succeeds, returning a new
       null filehandle.

       Writing to any object of this class is always a no-operation, and
       returns true.

       Reading from any object of this class is always no-operation, and
       returns empty-string or empty-list, as appropriate.

WHY
       You could say:

         open(NULL, '>/dev/null') || die "WHAAT?! $!";

       and get a null FH that way.  But not everyone is using an OS that has a
       "/dev/null"

IMPLEMENTATION
       This is a subclass of IO::Handle.  Applicable methods with subs that do
       nothing, and return an appropriate value.

SEE ALSO
       IO::Handle, perltie, IO::Scalar

CAVEATS
       * This:

         use IO::Null;
         $^W = 1;  # turn on warnings
         tie(*FOO, IO::Null);
         print FOO "Lalalalala!\n";  # does nothing.
         untie(*FOO);

       has been known to produce this odd warning:

         untie attempted while 3 inner references still exist.

       and I've no idea why.

       * Furthermore, this:

         use IO::Null;
         $^W = 1;
         *FOO = IO::Null->new;
         print FOO "Lalalalala!\n";  # does nothing.
         close(FOO);

       emits these warnings:

         Filehandle main::FOO never opened.
         Close on unopened file <GLOB>.

       ...which are, in fact, true; the FH behind the FOO{IO} was never opened
       on any real filehandle.  (I'd welcome anyone's (working) suggestions on
       how to suppress these warnings.)

       You get the same warnings with:

         use IO::Null;
         $^W = 1;
         my $fh = IO::Null->new;
         print $fh "Lalalalala!\n";  # does nothing.
         close $fh;

       Note that this, however:

         use IO::Null;
         $^W = 1;
         my $fh = IO::Null->new;
         $fh->print("Lalalalala!\n");  # does nothing.
         $fh->close();

       emits no warnings.

       * I don't know if you can successfully untaint a null filehandle.

       * This:

         $null_fh->fileno

       will return a defined and nonzero number, but one you're not likely to
       want to use for anything.  See the source.

       * These docs are longer than the source itself.  Read the source!
