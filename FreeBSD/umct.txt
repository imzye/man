UMCT(4)                FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                UMCT(4)

NAME
     umct – Magic Control Technology USB-RS232 converter driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device usb
           device ucom
           device umct

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           umct_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The umct driver provides support for USB to RS-232 converters based on
     the Magic Control Technology USB-232 design.  These devices support most
     of the standard RS-232 features including baud rates ranging from 300 to
     115200 bits per second.  However, neither hardware nor software flow
     control seems to be supported.

     Access to devices under this driver is via the ucom(4) framework and
     device nodes.

HARDWARE
     The umct driver supports the following adapters:

     •   Belkin F5U109
     •   Belkin F5U409
     •   D-Link DU-H3SP USB BAY Hub
     •   Magic Control Technology USB-232
     •   Sitecom USB-232

FILES
     /dev/ttyU*       for callin ports
     /dev/ttyU*.init
     /dev/ttyU*.lock  corresponding callin initial-state and lock-state
                      devices

     /dev/cuaU*       for callout ports
     /dev/cuaU*.init
     /dev/cuaU*.lock  corresponding callout initial-state and lock-state

HISTORY
     The umct driver appeared in FreeBSD 5.2.  It is loosely based on the
     ubsa(4) driver by Alexander Kabaev <kan@FreeBSD.org> with documentation
     from Wolfgang Grandeggar <wolfgang@cec.ch>.
