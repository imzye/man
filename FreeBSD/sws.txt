NAME
       sws - Simple | Small | Safe  Web Server

SYNOPSIS
       sws

DESCRIPTION
       sws is a simple web server written in /bin/sh.  It should be able to
       run out of inetd on any Unix, Linux, or BSD system.  It provides
       directory indexing and serving of files under the document dir.  The
       default document directory is /usr/local/sws/docs/, this may be changed
       at install time by editing the config area at the top of the program.
       Directory indexing may also be turned off by changing the vlaue of
       DOINDEX to anything other than yes in the config section of the
       program.

       sws prevents escaping the document directory tree and also ignores any
       trailing information after the URL to prevent compromise of the system
       on which it is running.

       sws will serve only static pages.  It has no provision for cgi
       programs.


EXAMPLE

DEPENDS ON
       sws requires /bin/sh, dirname, cat, and date to function.  These should
       be found on any modern POSIX system.
