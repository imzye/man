maildirqmtp(1)          FreeBSD General Commands Manual         maildirqmtp(1)

NAME
       maildirqmtp - send a maildir through QMTP

SYNOPSIS
       maildirqmtp dir prefix host

DESCRIPTION
       maildirqmtp scans a maildir, dir, and sends each message to host
       through QMTP.  It removes prefix from the beginning of each envelope
       recipient address.  It ignores any message whose recipient address does
       not begin with prefix.

       maildirqmtp removes messages accepted by host.  It bounces messages
       permanently rejected by host back to the envelope sender, and then
       removes them.  It treats temporary rejection as permanent rejection for
       messages more than two weeks old.

       Note that failure to connect to host is not temporary rejection.  If
       host is never reachable, maildirqmtp will never remove messages.

       maildirqmtp needs tcpclient in $PATH.
