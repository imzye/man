WLANDEBUG(8)            FreeBSD System Manager's Manual           WLANDEBUG(8)

NAME
     wlandebug – set/query 802.11 wireless debugging messages

SYNOPSIS
     wlandebug [-d | -i ifnet] [-flag|+flag ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The wlandebug command is a tool for enabling and disabling debugging
     messages in the wlan(4) module.  Running wlandebug without any options
     will display the current messages enabled for the specified network
     interface (by default, ``wlan0').  The default debugging level for new
     interfaces can be set by specifying the -d option.  When run as the
     super-user wlandebug can be used to enable and/or disable debugging
     messages.

     To enable debugging messages of a certain type use +type; to disable such
     messages use -type.  Multiple messages can be enabled and disabled with a
     single command.

     Messages are organized in the following groups:

     debug         general debugging facilities; equivalent to setting the
                   debug parameter with ifconfig(8).

     dumppkts      dump packet contents on transmit and receive.

     crypto        crypto-related work.

     input         errors encountered during input handling.

     xrate         extended rate set handling (for 802.11g).

     elemid        information element processing in 802.11 management frames.

     node          management of per-station state.

     assoc         802.11 station association processing; particularly useful
                   to see when stations join and leave a BSS.

     auth          802.11 station authentication processing.

     scan          scanning operation; especially useful for debugging
                   problems with not locating an access point.

     output        errors encountered during output handling.

     state         wlan(4) state machine operation.

     power         802.11 power save operation; in hostap mode this enables
                   copious information about buffered frames for stations
                   operating in power save mode.

     hwmp          trace operation of Hybrid Wireless Mesh Protocol
                   processing.

     dot1xsm       802.1x state machine operation; not presently meaningful as
                   802.1x protocol support is implemented in user mode by the
                   hostapd(8) program.

     radius        radius backend operation as it relates to 802.1x operation;
                   not presently meaningful as 802.1x protocol support is
                   implemented in user mode by the hostapd(8) program.

     raddump       dump packets exchanged with the radius backend for 802.1x
                   operation; not presently meaningful as 802.1x protocol
                   support is implemented in user mode by the hostapd(8)
                   program.

     mesh          trace operation of 802.11s mesh protocol processing.

     wpa           trace operation of the WPA protocol; only partly meaningful
                   as WPA protocol support is mostly implemented in user mode
                   by the hostapd(8) and wpa_supplicant(8) programs.

     acl           trace operation of the Access Control List (ACL) support;
                   see wlan_acl(4) for more details.

     wme           trace operation of WME/WMM protocol processing.

     superg        trace operation of Atheros SuperG protocol processing.

     doth          trace operation of IEEE 802.11h protocol processing.

     inact         trace station inactivity processing; in particular, show
                   when stations associated to an access point are dropped due
                   to inactivity.

     roam          trace station mode roaming between access points.

     rate          trace transmit rate control operation.

EXAMPLES
     The following might be used to debug basic station mode operation:

           wlandebug -i wlan1 scan+auth+assoc

     it enables debug messages while scanning, authenticating to an access
     point, and associating to an access point.

NOTES
     Different wireless drivers support different debugging messages.  Drivers
     such as ath(4) and ral(4) that depend on the wlan(4) module for 802.11
     protocol processing typically support most of the debugging messages
     while devices that implement parts of the 802.11 protocol in firmware do
     not.

     Some debugging messages are no longer meaningful because protocol
     processing has moved from the operating system to user mode programs such
     as hostapd(8) and wpa_supplicant(8).
