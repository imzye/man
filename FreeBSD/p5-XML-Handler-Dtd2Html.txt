DESCRIPTION
       dtd2html is a front-end for XML::Handler::Dtd2Html and its subclasses.
       It uses them to generate HTML documentation from DTD source.

       Because it uses XML::Parser and an external DTD is not a valid XML
       document, the input source must be an XML document with an internal DTD
       or an XML document that refers to an external DTD.

       The goal of this tool is to increase the level of documentation in DTD
       and to supply a more readable format for DTD.

       It is a tool for DTD users, not for writer.

       All comments before a declaration are captured.

       All entity references inside attribute values are expanded.

       This tool needs XML::SAX::Base, XML::SAX::Exception, XML::SAX::Expat,
       XML::Parser and HTML::Template modules.

   Comments
       XML files (and DTD) can include comments. The XML syntax is :

        <!-- comments -->

       All comments before a declaration are captured (except with -M option).
       Each comment generates its own paragraph <p>.

   Standard HTML
       You can embed standard HTML tags within a comment. However, don't use
       tags heading tags like <h1> or <hr>. dtd2html creates an entire
       structured document and these structural tags interfere with formatting
       of the generated document.

       So, you must use entities &lt; &gt; &amp; within a comment.

   dtd2html Tags
       dtd2html parses tags that are recognized when they are embedded within
       an XML comment. These doc tags enable you to autogenerate a complete,
       well-formatted document from your XML source. The tags start with an @.
       A tag with two @ forces a link generation if the option -H is set.

       Tags must start at the beginning of a line.

       The special tag @BRIEF puts its value in 'Name' section (in book mode).

       The special tag @INCLUDE allows inclusion of the content of an external
       file.

        <!--
          comments
          @Version : 1.0
          @INCLUDE : description.txt
          @@See Also : REC-xml
        -->

       The special tag @HIDDEN don't put the data in the documentation.

       The special tag @TITLE before <!DOCTYPE> has the same effect as the
       option -t.

       The special tag @SAMPLE allows inclusion of a XML fragment from an
       external file.

        <!--
          comments
          @SAMPLE ex2 : ex2.xml
        -->

       The special tags are case insensitive.

   HTML Templates
       Since version 0.30, HTML design and Perl programming are decoupling.
       And a language switch option is available.

       So, translation of the templates are welcome.
