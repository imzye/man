NAME
       wildmidi - example player for libWildMidi

LIBRARY
       libWildMidi

FILES
       /usr/local/share/wildmidi/wildmidi.cfg

SYNOPSIS
       wildmidi [-bhlvwnst] [-c config-file] [-d audiodev] [-m volume-level]
       [-o wav-file] [-f frequency-Hz(MUS)] [-r sample-rate] [-g
       convert-xmi-type] midifile ...

DESCRIPTION
       This is a demonstration program to show the capabilities of
       libWildMidi.

       midifile can be a MIDI type file in the HMI, HMP, MIDI, MUS or XMI
       formats and is processed by libWildMidi and the resulting audio is
       output by the player.

       You can have more than one midifile on the command line and wildmidi
       will pass them to libWildMidi for processing, one after the other. You
       can also use wildcards, for example: wildmidi *.mid

OPTIONS
       -b | --reverb
              Turns on an 8 point reverb engine that adds depth to the final
              mix.

       -c config-file | --config config-file
              Uses the configuration file stated by config-file instead of
              /usr/local/share/wildmidi/wildmidi.cfg

       -d audiodev | --device=audiodev
              Send the audio to audiodev instead of the default. ALSA defaults
              to the system "default" while OSS defaults to "/dev/dsp". Other
              environments do not support this option.

       -h | --help
              Displays command line options.

       -f | --frequency
              Use frequency F Hz for playback (MUS).

       -g | --convert
              Convert XMI: 0 - No Conversion (default)
                           1 - MT32 to GM
                           2 - MT32 to GS

       -l | --log_vol
              Some MIDI files have been recorded on hardware that uses a
              volume curve, making them sound really badly mixed on other MIDI
              devices. Use this option to use volume curves.

       -m volume-level | --mastervol=volume-level
              Set the overall volume level to volume-level. The minimum is 0
              and the maximum is 127, with the default being 100.

       -o wav-file | --wavout=wav-file
              Records the audio in wav format to wav-file.

       -r sndrate | --rate=sndrate
              Set the audio output rate to sndrate. The default rate is 32072.

       -n | --roundtempo
              Round tempo to nearest whole number.

       -s | --skipsilentstart
              Skips any silence at the start of playback.

       -v | --version
              Display version and copyright information.

       -x | --tomidi
              Convert a MUS or an XMI file to midi and save to file.

TEST OPTIONS
       These options are not designed for general use. Instead these options
       are designed to make it easier to listen to specific sound samples.

       Note: These options are not displayed by -h | --help

       -k N | --test_bank=N
              Set the test bank to N. Range is 0 to 127.

       -p N | --test_patch=N
              Set the test patch to N. Range is 0 to 127.

       -t | --test_midi
              Plays the built in test midi which plays all 127 notes.

USER INTERFACE
       The player accepts limited user input that allows some interaction
       while playing midi files.

       +      Turns the master volume up.

       -      Turns the master volume down.

       e      Turns enhanced resampling on and off.

       l      Turns volume curves on and off.

       r      Turns the final mix reverb on and off.

       n      Play the next midi on the command line.

       m      Save the currently playing file to a midi file. NOTE: This saves
              to the current directory.

       p      Pause the playback. Note: since the audio is buffered it will
              stop when the audio buffer is empty.

       .      Seek forward 1 second. Note: Clears active midi events and will
              only play midi events from after the new position.

       ,      Seek backwards 1 second. Note: Clears active midi events and
              will only play midi events from after the new position.

       q      Quit wildmidi.
