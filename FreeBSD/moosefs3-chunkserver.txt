NAME
       mfschunkserver.cfg - main configuration file for mfschunkserver

DESCRIPTION
       The file mfschunkserver.cfg contains configuration of MooseFS
       chunkserver process.

SYNTAX
       Syntax is:

       OPTION = VALUE

       Lines starting with # character are ignored as comments.

OPTIONS
       Configuration options:

       WORKING_USER
              user to run daemon as

       WORKING_GROUP
              group to run daemon as; optional value - if empty then default
              user group will be used

       SYSLOG_IDENT
              name of process to place in syslog messages; default is
              mfschunkserver

       LOCK_MEMORY
              whether to perform mlockall() to avoid swapping out
              mfschunkserver process; default is 0, i.e. no

       LIMIT_GLIBC_MALLOC_ARENAS
              limit malloc arenas to given value - prevents server from using
              huge amount of virtual memory (Linux onty, default is 4)

       DISABLE_OOM_KILLER
              disable out of memory killer (Linux only, default is 1)

       NICE_LEVEL
              nice level to run daemon with; default is -19; note: process
              must be started as root to increase priority, if setting of
              priority fails, process retains the nice level it started with

       FILE_UMASK
              set default umask for group and others (user has always 0);
              default is 027 - block write for group and block all for others

       DATA_PATH
              where to store daemon lock file

       HDD_CONF_FILENAME
              alternate location/name of mfshdd.cfg file

       HDD_TEST_FREQ
              This option is deprecated. Please define HDD_TEST_SPEED instead.
              If HDD_TEST_SPEED is not defined then system will try to use
              HDD_TEST_FREQ but will convert it to HDD_TEST_SPEED using
              formula: HDD_TEST_SPEED = 10 / HDD_TEST_FREQ

       HDD_TEST_SPEED
              Speed of background chunk tests in MB/s per disk (formally entry
              defined in mfshdd.cfg). Value can be given as a decimal number;
              default is 1.0

       HDD_MIN_TEST_INTERVAL
              prevents from testing chunk integrity when last I/O (including
              test) was performed less than HDD_MIN_TEST_INTERVAL seconds ago;
              default is 86400

       HDD_FADVISE_MIN_TIME
              If possible use posix_fadvise(POSIX_DONTNEED) after each chunk
              test (but only if last I/O operation was performed more than
              HDD_FADVISE_MIN_TIME seconds ago). Using zero will always
              perform posix_fadvise (flush cache) and using negative value
              will never flush cache after tests. This setting is valid only
              for system s that support posix_fadivise; default value is 86400

       HDD_LEAVE_SPACE_DEFAULT
              how much space should be left unused on each hard drive; number
              format: [0-9]*(.[0-9]*)?([kMGTPE]|[KMGTPE]i)?B? ; default is
              256MiB; examples: 0.5GB, .5G, 2.56GiB, 1256M etc.

       HDD_REBALANCE_UTILIZATION
              percent of total work time the chunkserver is allowed to spend
              on hdd space rebalancing; default is 20

       HDD_HIGH_SPEED_REBALANCE_LIMIT
              maximum simultaneous writes per disk in high speed disk
              rebalance (0 means use standard rebalance; default is 0)

       HDD_ERROR_TOLERANCE_COUNT, HDD_ERROR_TOLERANCE_PERIOD
              how many i/o errors (COUNT) to tolerate in given amount of
              seconds (PERIOD) on a single hard drive; if the number of errors
              exceeds this setting, the offending hard drive will be marked as
              damaged; defaults are 2 and 600

       HDD_FSYNC_BEFORE_CLOSE
              enables/disables fsync before chunk closing; default is 0 (off)

       HDD_SPARSIFY_ON_WRITE
              enables/disables sparsification (skip leading and trailing
              zeros) during writing new block; default is 1 (on)

       HDD_RR_CHUNK_COUNT
              how many chunks should be created in one directory before moving
              to the next one; higher values are better with most OSes caching
              algorithms, low values lead to more even chunk distribution;
              default is 10000 which works best in most cases

       HDD_KEEP_DUPLICATES_HOURS
              how many hours duplicate chunks should be kept before deleting
              (default is 168 - one week); changign this value and reloading
              will reset the counter

       ALLOW_STARTING_WITH_INVALID_DISKS
              when set to one chunkserver will not abort start even when
              incorrect entries are found in 'mfshdd.cfg' file; default is 0
              (do not start with invalid entries)

       WORKERS_MAX, WORKERS_MAX_IDLE
              maximum number of active workers and maximum number of idle
              workers; defaults are 250 and 40

       LABELS labels string defined as a set of letters (case insensitive)
              separated by coma or semicolon; default is empty - no labels

       BIND_HOST
              local address to use for master connections; default is *, i.e.
              default local address

       MASTER_HOST
              MooseFS master host, IP is allowed only in single-master
              installations; default is mfsmaster

       MASTER_PORT
              MooseFS master command port; default is 9420

       MASTER_CONTROL_PORT
              MooseFS master control port; default is 9419

       MASTER_TIMEOUT
              timeout in seconds for master connections (if not 0); If this
              value is zero then chunkserver sets it initially to 10 and asks
              master for this value. default is 0 (ask master).

       MASTER_RECONNECTION_DELAY
              delay in seconds before trying to reconnect to master after
              disconnection (default is 5)

       AUTH_CODE
              authentication string (used only when master requires
              authorization)

       BIND_HOST
              local address to use for connecting with master (default is *,
              i.e. default local address)

       CHUNKS_PER_REGISTER_PACKET
              maximum number of chunks system will try to put in a single
              register message (default is 10000, limits 1000-100000)

       CSSERV_LISTEN_HOST
              IP address to listen on for client (mount) connections (* means
              any)

       CSSERV_LISTEN_PORT
              port to listen on for client (mount) connections (default is
              9422)
