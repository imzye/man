DESCRIPTION
       Redir redirects tcp connections coming in to a local port to a
       specified address/port combination.

       It may be run either from inetd or as a standalone daemon.  Depending
       on how redir was compiled, not all options may be available.

OPTIONS
       --lport
              Specifies port to listen for connections on (when not running
              from inetd)

       --laddr
              IP address to bind to when listening for connections (when not
              running from inetd)

       --cport
              Specifies port to connect to.

       --caddr
              Specifies remote host to connect to. (localhost if omitted)

       --inetd
              Run as a process started from inetd, with the connection passed
              as stdin and stdout on startup.

       --debug
              Write debug output to stderr or syslog.

       --name Specify program name to be used for TCP wrapper checks and
              syslog logging.

       --timeout
              Timeout and close the connection after n seconds on inactivity.

       --syslog
              Log information to syslog.

       --bind_addr
              Forces redir to pick a specific address/interface to bind to
              when it listens for incoming connections.

       --ftp  When using redir for an FTP server, this will cause redir to
              also redirect ftp connections.  Type should be specified as
              either "port", "pasv", or "both", to specify what type of FTP
              connection to handle.  Note that --transproxy often makes one or
              the other (generally port) undesirable.

       --transproxy
              On a linux system with transparany proxying enables, causes
              redir to make connections appear as if they had come from their
              true origin.  (see transproxy.txt in the source archive)

       --connect
              Redirects connections through an HTTP proxy which supports the
              CONNECT command.  Specify the address and port of the proxy
              using --caddr and --cport.  --connect requires the hostname and
              port which the HTTP proxy will be asked to connect to.

       --bufsize n
              Set the bufsize (defaut 4096) in bytes. Can be used combined
              with --maxbandwidth or --random_wait to simulate a slow
              connection.

       --maxbandwidth n
              Reduce the bandwidth to be no more than n bits/sec.  The
              algorithme is basic, the goal is to simulate a slow connection,
              so there is no pic acceptance.

       --random_wait n
              Wait between 0 and 2 x n milliseconds before each "packet". A
              "packet" is a bloc of data read in one time by redir. A "packet"
              size is always less than the bufsize (see also --bufsize).

       --wait_in_out n
              Apply --maxbandwidth and --random_wait for input if n=1, output
              if n=2 and both if n=3.
