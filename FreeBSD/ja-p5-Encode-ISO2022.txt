NAME
       Encode::ISO2022 - ISO/IEC 2022 character encoding scheme

SYNOPSIS
         package FooEncoding;
         use base qw(Encode::ISO2022);

         __PACKAGE__->Define(
           Name => 'foo-encoding',
           CCS => [ {...CCS one...}, {...CCS two...}, ....]
         );

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a character encoding scheme (CES) switching a set
       of multiple coded character sets (CCS).

       A class method Define() may take following arguments.

       Alias => REGEX
           The regular expression representing alias of this encoding, if any.

       Name => STRING
           The name of this encoding as Encode::Encoding object.  Mandatory.

       CCS => [ FEATURE, FEATURE, ...]
           List of features defining CCSs used by this encoding.  Mandatory.
           Each item is a hash reference containing following items.

           bytes => NUMBER
               Number of bytes to represent each character.  Default is 1.

           cl => BOOLEAN
               If true value is set, this CCS includes map to/from code points
               between 0/0 and 1/15.  There should be one CCS with this flag
               to reset broken designation.

           dec_only => BOOLEAN
               If true value is set, this CCS will be used only for decoding.

           encoding => STRING | ENCODING
               Encode::Encoding object used as CCS, or its name.  Mandatory.

               Encodings used for CCS must provide "raw" conversion.  Namely,
               they must be stateless and fixed-length conversion over 94^n or
               96^n code tables.  Encode::ISO2022::CCS lists available CCSs.

           g => STRING
           g_init => STRING
               Working set this CCS may be designated to: 'g0', 'g1', 'g2' or
               'g3'.

               If "g_init" is set, this CCS will be designated at beginning of
               coversion implicitly, and at end of conversion explicitly.

               If "g" or "g_init" is set and neither of "ls" nor "ss" is set,
               this CCS will be invoked when it is designated.

               If neither of "g", "g_init", "ls" nor "ss" is set, this CCS is
               invoked always.

           g_seq => STRING
               Escape sequence to designate this CCS, if it can be designated
               explicitly.

           gr => BOOLEAN
               If true value is set, this CCS will be invoked to GR using
               7-bit conversion table.

           ls => STRING
           ss => STRING
               Escape sequence or control character to invoke this CCS, if it
               should be invoked explicitly.

               If "ls" is set, this CCS will be invoked by locking-shift.  If
               "ss" is set, this CCS will be invoked by single-shift.

           range => STRING
               Possible range of encoded bytes.  General value is '\x21-\x7E',
               '\x20-\x7F', '\xA1-\xFE' or '\xA0-\xFF'.  This is required for
               multibyte CCSs to detect broken multibyte sequences.

       LineInit => BOOLEAN
           If it is true, designation and invokation states will be
           initialized at beginning of lines.

       SubChar => STRING
           Unicode string to be used for substitution character.

       may be an example.

CAVEATS
       This module implements small subset of the features defined by ISO/IEC
       2022.  Each encoding recognizes only several predefined designation and
       invokation functions.  It can handle limited number of coded character
       sets.  Variable length multibyte coded character sets aren't supported.
       And so on.
