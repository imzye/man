NAME
       Xymon - Xymon Base Module

SYNOPSIS
         use Xymon;
         blah blah blah

DESCRIPTION
       Stub documentation for this module was created by
       ExtUtils::ModuleMaker.  It looks like the author of the extension was
       negligent enough to leave the stub unedited.

       Blah blah blah.
