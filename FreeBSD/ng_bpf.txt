NG_BPF(4)              FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual              NG_BPF(4)

NAME
     ng_bpf – Berkeley packet filter netgraph node type

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <net/bpf.h>
     #include <netgraph.h>
     #include <netgraph/ng_bpf.h>

DESCRIPTION
     The bpf node type allows Berkeley Packet Filter (see bpf(4)) filters to
     be applied to data travelling through a Netgraph network.  Each node
     allows an arbitrary number of connections to arbitrarily named hooks.
     With each hook is associated a bpf(4) filter program which is applied to
     incoming data only, a destination hook for matching packets, a
     destination hook for non-matching packets, and various statistics
     counters.

     A bpf(4) program returns an unsigned integer, which is normally
     interpreted as the length of the prefix of the packet to return.  In the
     context of this node type, returning zero is considered a non-match, in
     which case the entire packet is delivered out the non-match destination
     hook.  Returning a value greater than zero causes the packet to be
     truncated to that length and delivered out the match destination hook.
     Either or both destination hooks may be the empty string, or may not
     exist, in which case the packet is dropped.

     New hooks are initially configured to drop all packets.  A new filter
     program may be installed using the NGM_BPF_SET_PROGRAM control message.

HOOKS
     This node type supports any number of hooks having arbitrary names.

CONTROL MESSAGES
     This node type supports the generic control messages, plus the following:

     NGM_BPF_SET_PROGRAM (setprogram)
          This command sets the filter program that will be applied to
          incoming data on a hook.  The following structure must be supplied
          as an argument:

              struct ng_bpf_hookprog {
                char            thisHook[NG_HOOKSIZ];     /* name of hook */
                char            ifMatch[NG_HOOKSIZ];      /* match dest hook */
                char            ifNotMatch[NG_HOOKSIZ];   /* !match dest hook */
                int32_t         bpf_prog_len;             /* #insns in program */
                struct bpf_insn bpf_prog[];               /* bpf program */
              };

          The hook to be updated is specified in thisHook.  The BPF program is
          the sequence of instructions in the bpf_prog array; there must be
          bpf_prog_len of them.  Matching and non-matching incoming packets
          are delivered out the hooks named ifMatch and ifNotMatch,
          respectively.  The program must be a valid bpf(4) program or else
          EINVAL is returned.

     NGM_BPF_GET_PROGRAM (getprogram)
          This command takes an ASCII string argument, the hook name, and
          returns the corresponding struct ng_bpf_hookprog as shown above.

     NGM_BPF_GET_STATS (getstats)
          This command takes an ASCII string argument, the hook name, and
          returns the statistics associated with the hook as a struct
          ng_bpf_hookstat.

     NGM_BPF_CLR_STATS (clrstats)
          This command takes an ASCII string argument, the hook name, and
          clears the statistics associated with the hook.

     NGM_BPF_GETCLR_STATS (getclrstats)
          This command is identical to NGM_BPF_GET_STATS, except that the
          statistics are also atomically cleared.

SHUTDOWN
     This node shuts down upon receipt of a NGM_SHUTDOWN control message, or
     when all hooks have been disconnected.

EXAMPLES
     It is possible to configure a node from the command line, using
     tcpdump(1) to generate raw BPF instructions which are then transformed
     into the ASCII form of a NGM_BPF_SET_PROGRAM control message, as
     demonstrated here:

         #!/bin/sh

         PATTERN="tcp dst port 80"
         NODEPATH="my_node:"
         INHOOK="hook1"
         MATCHHOOK="hook2"
         NOTMATCHHOOK="hook3"

         BPFPROG=$( tcpdump -s 8192 -p -ddd ${PATTERN} | \
                    ( read len ; \
                      echo -n "bpf_prog_len=$len " ; \
                      echo -n "bpf_prog=[" ; \
                      while read code jt jf k ; do \
                          echo -n " { code=$code jt=$jt jf=$jf k=$k }" ; \
                      done ; \
                      echo " ]" ) )

         ngctl msg ${NODEPATH} setprogram { thisHook=\"${INHOOK}\" \
           ifMatch=\"${MATCHHOOK}\" \
           ifNotMatch=\"${NOTMATCHHOOK}\" \
           ${BPFPROG} }

     Based on the previous example, it is possible to prevent a jail (or a VM)
     from spoofing by allowing only traffic that has the expected ethernet and
     IP addresses:

         #!/bin/sh

         NODEPATH="my_node:"
         JAIL_MAC="0a:00:de:ad:be:ef"
         JAIL_IP="128.66.1.42"
         JAIL_HOOK="jail"
         HOST_HOOK="host"
         DEBUG_HOOK="nomatch"

         bpf_prog() {
             local PATTERN=$1

             tcpdump -s 8192 -p -ddd ${PATTERN} | (
                 read len
                 echo -n "bpf_prog_len=$len "
                 echo -n "bpf_prog=["
                 while read code jt jf k ; do
                     echo -n " { code=$code jt=$jt jf=$jf k=$k }"
                 done
                 echo " ]"
             )
         }

         # Prevent jail from spoofing (filter packets coming from jail)
         ngctl msg ${NODEPATH} setprogram {                        \
             thisHook=\"${JAIL_HOOK}\"                             \
             ifMatch=\"${HOST_HOOK}\"                              \
             ifNotMatch=\"${DEBUG_HOOK}\"                          \
             $(bpf_prog "ether src ${JAIL_MAC} && src ${JAIL_IP}") \
         }

         # Prevent jail from receiving spoofed packets (filter packets
         # coming from host)
         ngctl msg ${NODEPATH} setprogram {                        \
             thisHook=\"${HOST_HOOK}\"                             \
             ifMatch=\"${JAIL_HOOK}\"                              \
             ifNotMatch=\"${DEBUG_HOOK}\"                          \
             $(bpf_prog "ether dst ${JAIL_MAC} && dst ${JAIL_IP}") \
         }

BUGS
     When built as a loadable kernel module, this module includes the file
     net/bpf_filter.c.  Although loading the module should fail if
     net/bpf_filter.c already exists in the kernel, currently it does not, and
     the duplicate copies of the file do not interfere.  However, this may
     change in the future.
