NAME
       xdtm - graphical shell for X

SYNOPSIS
       xdtm [ -cf configuration_file ] [ -delay time ] [ -dmfont font_name ] [
       standard X options ]

DESCRIPTION
       The X Desktop Manager is a graphical shell for the X Window System.  It
       provides facilities to list directories graphically, view, edit, copy,
       move, delete, and modify permissions on files, and to launch programs.

       It comes with comprehensive help available from within the program,
       this should be consulted for instructions on how to use the program.

       The -cf option tells xdtm to use the following file as the
       configuration file. If this file is not found xdtm will try the users
       home directory for the file .xdtmrc, if that fails the system xdtmrc
       will be used.

       The -delay option is used on systems with NFS mounted directories.  It
       specifies the time in seconds to delay between updating a directories
       contents and updating the directory listing within xdtm. A value of 1
       second is usually enough unless the network is very heavily loaded. The
       valid range is between 1 and 5 seconds.

       The -dmfont option is used to specify the font to be used to list the
       filenames in the directory list. Because this font is used in the long
       listing mode within which spaces are used to align the columns of data
       a fixed width font should be specified.

       Any standard X Toolkit command line options may be used in addition to
       the ones already listed above.

DIAGNOSTICS

       executes.  It will also complain about any errors in accessing files.
