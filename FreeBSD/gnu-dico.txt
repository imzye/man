NOTE
       This manpage is a short description of GNU dico.  For a detailed
       discussion, including examples and usage recommendations, refer to the
       GNU Dico Manual available in texinfo format.  If the info reader and
       GNU Dico documentation are properly installed on your system, the
       command

           info dico

       should give you access to the complete manual.

       You can also view the manual using the info mode in emacs(1), or find
       it in various formats online at

           http://www.gnu.org.ua/software/dico/manual

       If any discrepancies occur between this manpage and the GNU Dico
       Manual, the later shall be considered the authoritative source.

DESCRIPTION
       Console-based utility for querying dictionary servers.  It has two
       operation modes.

       In single query mode, dico performs a query, displays its result and
       exits immediately.  This mode is enabled if a word or a URL was given
       in the command line.

       In interactive mode, dico enters a read-and-eval loop, in which it
       reads requests from the keyboard, performs the necessary searches, and
       displays obtained results on the screen.

       Upon startup, dico looks for initialization files named .dico in the
       current user's home directory, and the current working directory.  If
       found, these files are read in order, and their contents is treated as
       a sequence of commands, which are executed.  See the section COMMANDS,
       for a discussion of available commands.

COMMANDS
       In interactive mode dico reads commands from the standard input,
       executes them and displays results on the standard output.  If the
       standard input is connected to a terminal, the readline and history
       facilities are enabled.

       The input syntax is designed so as to save you the maximum amount of
       typing.

       A line beginning with a # sign introduces a comment and is ignored.

       Typing quiestion mark alone shows a short usage summary.

       All commands begin with a command prefix, a single punctuation
       character used to tell a command from a define or match request.  The
       default command prefix is a dot.

       Any input starting with a slash is a match request.  For example,

         /sail

       will display all headwords matching the word sail in the currently
       selected database.

       Any input not starting with / or command prefix is a definition
       request.  It is looked up using the defaault server and database
       settings, and the result is displayed on the screen.

       Dico initialization files have the same syntax, excepting that no
       command prefix is used by default.

       Available commands (without prefix) are summarized in the table below:

       autologin FILE
              Use FILE for authentication.  If FILE begins with ~/, this
              prefix is replaced with the name of the current user home
              directory, followed by /.  The prefix ~USER/ is replaced with
              the home directory of USER.  This command is mostly useful in
              the initialization file.

              See the section AUTOLOGIN FILE, for a discussion of this
              feature.

       close  Close the existing connection.

       database [NAME]
              Without argument, display the currently selected database.  With
              argument, select the database NAME.

       distance [N]
              If the remote server supports xlev experimental capability, this
              command shows the maximum Levenshtein distance.  With argument,
              it sets the distance.

       help   Displays short command usage summary.  For convenience, a single
              question mark can be used instead of this command.

       history
              Show command history.

       info [NAME]
              Display information about the database NAME, or the currently
              selected database, if used without arguments.

       ld     List databases.

       ls     List strategies.

       open HOST [PORT]
              Establish connection with remote server HOST.  If given, use
              PORT instead of the default 2628.

       pager [COMMAND]
              Sets or displays external command used for paging output.

       prefix [CHAR]
              Without argument, shows the currently selected command prefix.
              With argument, sets command prefix to the given value.

       prompt STRING
              Sets dico command line prompt.

       quiet yes|no
              Toggle the startup banner.  Useful in the initialization file.

       quit   Quit the dico shell.

       sasl [yes|no]
              Without argument, show whether the SASL authentication is
              enabled.  With argument, enable or disable it.

       strategy [NAME]
              Without argument, display the currently selected matching
              strateguy.  With argument, select the strategy NAME.

       transcript [yes|no]
              Enable or disable session transcript.  When the transcript is
              on, dico displays raw DICT commands and answers as they are
              executed.  It is useful for debugging purposes.

              Used without arguments, this command shows current state of the
              transcript.

       version
              Print program version.

       warranty
              Print the copyright statement.

AUTOLOGIN FILE
       After connecting to a remote server, dico checks if the server supports
       authentication and attempts to authenticate itself if so.  The
       authentication credentials are taken from the following sources:

       1.     Command line options --user and --password.

       2.     URL given as a command line argument.

       3.     Autologin files.

       These three sources are consulted in that order, i.e., a user name
       supplied with the --user command line option takes precedence over the
       one found in an URL and over any names supplied by autologin files.

       If, after consulting all these sources, the user name is established,
       while the password is not, the resulting action depends on whether the
       standard input is connected to a terminal.  If it is, dico will ask the
       user to supply a password.  If it is not, authentication is aborted and
       connection to the server is closed.

       Some authentication mechanisms require additional credentials.  For
       example, GSSAPI authentication requires a service name.  These
       credentials can be supplied only in autologin file.

       Autologin file is a plaintext file that contains authentication
       information for various DICT servers.  At most two autologin files are
       consulted: first the session-specific file, if it is supplied by
       autologin command or by the --autologin command line option, next the
       default file .dicologin in the user's home directory.  The default
       autologin file is examined only if no matching record was found in the
       session-specific one.

       The file format is similar to that of .netrc.

       Empty lines and comments are ignored.  Comments are introduced by a
       pound sign.  Non-empty lines constitute statements.  Tokens in a
       statement are separated with spaces, tabs, or newlines.  A valid
       statement must begin with one of the following:

       machine NAME
              This statement contains parameters for authenticating on server
              NAME.

       default
              This statement contains parameters for authenticating on any
              server, not explicitly listed in one of the machine statements.
              There can be at most one default statement in autologin file.
              Its exact location does not matter, it will always be matched
              after all explicit machine statements.

       The following clauses can follow:

       login NAME
              Supplies the user name for this server.

       password STRING
              Supplies the password for this server.

       noauth Do not perform authentication on this server.

       sasl   Enable SASL authentication.

       nosasl Disable SASL authentication.

       mechanisms LIST
              Declare acceptable SASL mechanisms.  The LIST argument is a
              comma-separated list of mechanism names, without intervening
              whitespace.  Multiple mechanisms clauses may be present, in
              which case the corresponding lists are concatenated.

       service NAME
              Declare service name, for authentication methods that need it.
              If this token is omitted, the default service name dico is used.

       realm NAME
              Declare realm for authentication.

       host NAME
              Set host name for this server.  By default, it is determined
              automatically.
