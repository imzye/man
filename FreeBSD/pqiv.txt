NAME
       pqiv - powerful quick image viewer

SYNOPSIS
       pqiv [options] [filename(s)...]

DESCRIPTION
       pqiv is a simple command line image viewer inspired by qiv. It is
       highly customizable and supports a variety of formats.

OPTIONS
       -c, --transparent-background
              Draw pqiv's window borderless and transparent. In window mode, a
              mouse click activates and deactivates window decorations.

       -d, --slideshow-interval=SECONDS
              In slideshow mode (Activated by --slideshow or key s by
              default), cycle through images at this rate. Floating point
              values are supported, e.g.  use 0.5 to move through the images
              at a rate of two images per second.

       -f, --fullscreen
              Start in fullscreen mode. Fullscreen can be toggled by pressing
              f at runtime by default.

       -F, --fade
              Fade between images. See also --fade-duration.

       -i, --hide-info-box
              Initially hide the info box. Whether the box is visible can be
              toggled by pressing i at runtime by default.

       --font=FONT
              Specify the Pango font string for the info box. Note that the
              font size will be scaled to the window.

       -l, --lazy-load
              pqiv normally processes all command line arguments before
              displaying its main window. With this option, the window is
              shown as soon as the first image has been found and loaded.

       -n, --sort
              Instead of storing images in the order they are given on the
              command line and found within directories, sort them. The
              default order is by name (natural order). See --sort-key to
              change the order.

       -P, --window-position=POSITION
              Set the initial window position. POSITION may either be

              x,y  screen coordinates, or

              off  to not position the window at all.

       -r, --additional-from-stdin
              Read additional filenames/folders from the standard input. This
              option conflicts with --actions-from-stdin.

       -s, --slideshow
              Start in slideshow mode. Slideshow mode can be toggled at
              runtime by pressing s by default.

       -t, --scale-images-up
              Scale images up to fill the whole screen. This can be toggled at
              runtime by pressing t by default. See also --disable-scaling.

       -T, --window-title=TITLE
              Set the title of the window. pqiv substitutes several variables
              into TITLE:

              $BASEFILENAME  The base file name of the current file (e.g.
                             `image.png'),

              $FILENAME      The file name of the current file (e.g.
                             `/home/user/image.png'),

              $WIDTH         The width of the current image in pixels,

              $HEIGHT        The height of the current image in pixels,

              $ZOOM          The current zoom level,

              $IMAGE_NUMBER  The index of the current image,

              $IMAGE_COUNT   The total number of images.

              The default is `pqiv: $FILENAME ($WIDTHx$HEIGHT) $ZOOM%
              [$IMAGE_NUMBER/$IMAGE_COUNT]'.

       -z, --zoom-level=FLOAT
              Set the initial zoom level as a floating point value, i.e., 1.0
              is 100%. This only applies to the first image, other images are
              scaled according to the scale mode (see --scale-images-up and
              --disable-scaling) and window size.

       -1, --command-1=COMMAND
              Bind the external COMMAND to key 1. You can use 2..9 to bind
              further commands. The ACTIONS feature (see below) allows one to
              bind further keys to other commands. COMMAND is executed using
              the default shell processor.  `$1' is substituted with the
              current file name. Unless COMMAND begins with `|' or `-', if
              `$1' is not present, the file name is appended to the command
              line.

              If COMMAND begins with `>', its standard output is displayed in
              a popup window.

              If COMMAND begins with `|', the current image is piped to its
              standard input, and its standard output is loaded as an image.
              This can be used to e.g.  process images.

              If COMMAND begins with `-', a list of currently marked images is
              piped to its standard input.

       --action=ACTION
              Execute a specific ACTION when starting pqiv. The syntax is
                     command(parameter); command(parameter);
              See the ACTIONS section below for available commands.

       --actions-from-stdin
              Like --action, but read actions from the standard input. See the
              ACTIONS section below for syntax and available commands. This
              option conflicts with --additional-from-stdin.

       --allow-empty-window
              pqiv normally does not display the main window until one image
              has been found, and quits when it cannot load any of the images
              anymore. With this option, both situations result in an empty
              pqiv window being shown.

       --auto-montage-mode
              Automatically enter montage mode if pqiv is started with more
              than one image.

       --background-pattern=PATTERN
              pqiv draws a checkerboard as transparent images' background. Use
              this option to alternatively use a white or black background.
              Valid values are checkerboard, white and black.

       --bind-key=KEY_BINDING
              Rebind a key to an action. The syntax is
                     key sequence { command(parameter); command(parameter); }
              A key sequence may be one or more characters, or special
              characters supplied as `<name>', where name is a GDK key
              specifier or a mouse button (`Mouse-1') or a scrolling direction
              (`Mouse-Scroll-1'). If you e.g. use `a<Control>b', then a user
              must hit `a' followed by control + `b' to trigger the command.
              It is possible to bind `a' and `ab' as well. The action bound to
              `a' will then be slightly delayed to allow a user to hit `b'.
              The semicolon separating commands is optional. See ACTIONS below
              for available commands.

              If you need to know the name of a key specifier, you can run xev
              and press the desired key. The name of the keysym will be
              printed in parentheses, preceded by `keysym' and a hexadecimal
              representation. An alternative is to run xmodmap -pk. The
              command outputs the symbolic names in parentheses.  Or use the
              list at
              https://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/plain/gdk/gdkkeysyms.h.

              pqiv groups key bindings into different contexts. Currently,
              montage mode is the only context other than the default one: In
              montage mode, different key bindings are used. To switch the
              context while binding key sequences, write
                     @MONTAGE { ... }
              and insert the special key bindings within the curly braces.

       --box-colors=FOREGROUND_COLOR:BACKGROUND_COLOR
              Customize the colors used to draw the info box and montage mode
              borders. Colors can be specified either as a comma separated
              list of RBG-values in the range from 0 to 255 or as a hexvalue,
              e.g., #aabbcc. The default value is #000000:#ffff00.

       --browse
              For each command line argument, additionally load all images
              from the image's directory. pqiv will still start at the image
              that was given as the first parameter.

       --disable-backends=LIST_OF_BACKENDS
              Use this option to selectively disable some of pqiv's backends.
              You can supply a comma separated list of backends here. Non-
              available backends are silently ignored. Disabling backends you
              don't want will speed up recursive loading significantly,
              especially if you disable the archive backend.  Available
              backends are:

              archive       generic archive file support

              archive_cbx   *.cb? comic book archive support

              libav         video support, works with ffmpeg as well

              gdkpixbuf     images

              poppler       PDF

              spectre       PS/EPS

              wand          ImageMagick, various formats, e.g. PSD

              webp          WebP format

       --disable-scaling
              Completely disable scaling. This can be toggled at runtime by
              pressing t by default. See also --scale-images-up.

       --end-of-files-action=ACTION
              If all files have been viewed and the next image is to be
              viewed, either by the user's request or because a slideshow is
              active, pqiv by default cycles and restarts at the first image.
              This parameter can be used to modify this behaviour. Valid
              choices for ACTION are:

              quit                Quit pqiv,

              wait                Wait until a new image becomes available.
                                  This only makes sense if used with e.g.
                                  --watch-directories,

              wrap (default)      Restart at the first image. In shuffle mode,
                                  choose a new random order,

              wrap-no-reshuffle   As wrap, but do not reshuffle in random
                                  mode.

       --enforce-window-aspect-ratio
              Tell the window manager to enforce the aspect ratio of the
              window. If this flag is set, then a compliant window manager
              will not allow users to resize pqiv's window to a different
              aspect ratio.  This used to be the default behaviour, but window
              managers tend to have bugs in the code handling forced aspect
              ratios. If the flag is not set and the aspect ratios of the
              window and image do not match, then the image will be still be
              drawn with the correct aspect ratio, with black borders added at
              the sides.

       --fade-duration=SECONDS
              With --fade, make each fade this long. Floating point values are
              accepted, e.g. 0.5 makes each fade take half a second.

       --low-memory
              Try to keep memory usage to a minimum. pqiv by default e.g.
              preloads the next and previous image to speed up navigation and
              caches scaled images to speed up redraws. This flag disables
              such optimizations.

       --max-depth=LEVELS
              For parameters that are directories, pqiv searches recursively
              for images. Use this parameter to limit the depth at which pqiv
              searches.  A level of 0 disables recursion completely, i.e. if
              you call pqiv with a directory as a parameter, it will not
              search it at all.

       --negate
              Display negatives of images. You can toggle this feature at
              runtime by pressing n.

       --shuffle
              Display files in random order. This option conflicts with
              --sort. Files are reshuffled after all images have been shown,
              but within one cycle, the order is stable. The reshuffling can
              be disabled using --end-of-files-action. At runtime, you can use
              Control + R by default to toggle shuffle mode; this retains the
              shuffled order, i.e., you can disable shuffle mode, view a few
              images, then enable it again and continue after the last image
              you viewed earlier in shuffle mode.

       --show-bindings
              Display the keyboard and mouse bindings and exit. This displays
              the key bindings in the format accepted by --bind-key. See
              there, and the ACTIONS section for details on available actions.

       --sort-key=PROPERTY
              Key to use for sorting. Supported values for PROPERTY are:

              name    To sort by filename in natural order, e.g. abc32d before
                      abc112d, but b1 after both,

              mtime   To sort by file modification date.

       --thumbnail-size=WIDTHxHEIGHT
              Adjust the size of thumbnails in montage mode. The default is
              128x128.

       --thumbnail-preload=COUNT
              Preload COUNT thumbnails adjacent to the current image while
              displaying images or having them selected in montage mode. This
              can be used to speed up montage mode, but will lead to high CPU
              loads.

       --thumbnail-persistence=DIRECTORY/STATUS
              Persist thumbnails to disk. The simplest way to use this option
              is to supply a value of yes. Thumbnails are then stored
              according to the Thumbnail Managing Standard, in
              $XDG_CACHE_HOME/thumbnails/*. The standard allows storage of
              thumbnails in sizes 128x128, 256x256, 512x512 and 1024x1024
              exclusively, and does not specify how to store thumbnails for
              files in archives or multi-page documents.  Thumbnails violating
              those constraints will be stored in a special x-pqiv subfolder.
              Supply standard to store standard compliant thumbnails only.  If
              this option is not used, then thumbnails will not be loaded from
              the cache either - any thumbnails will be regenerated each time
              montage mode is used.  A value of read-only can be used to load
              thumbnails, but never store them.  read-only is the default.

              If you supply local as the argument value, pqiv will store
              thumbnails in a subfolder named .sh_thumbnails relative to the
              images as specified by the Thumbnail Managing Standard. Your
              third option is to provide the name of a directory. pqiv will
              then use that directory to store thumbnails to.  The folder must
              be given as an absolute path, relative paths do not work.  Note
              that any folder not named .sh_thumbnails will be considered in
              --watch-directories. Also, note that while pqiv will store
              thumbnails to another folder, it will still attempt to load them
              from the standard folders as well.

       --recreate-window
              Workaround for window managers that do not handle resize
              requests correctly: Instead of resizing, recreate the window
              whenever the image is changed. This does not redraw images upon
              changes in zoom alone.

       --scale-mode-screen-fraction=FRACTION
              Adjust how much screen space pqiv uses when auto-scaling images
              outside fullscreen mode. Defaults to 0.8 (80%).

       --wait-for-images-to-appear
              If no images are found in the directories specified on the
              command line, instead of exiting, wait for some to appear. This
              option only works in conjunction with --lazy-load and
              --watch-directories.

       --watch-directories
              Watch all directories supplied as parameters to pqiv for new
              files and add them as they appear. In --sort mode, files are
              sorted into the correct position, else, they are appended to the
              end of the list.  See also --watch-files, which handles how
              changes to the image that is currently being viewed are handled.

       --watch-files=VALUE
              Watch files for changes on disk. Valid choices for VALUE are:

              on (default)   Watch files for changes, reload upon a change,
                             and skip to the next file if a file is removed,

              changes-only   Watch files for changes, reload upon a change,
                             but do nothing if a file is removed,

              off            Do not watch files for changes at all.

              Note that a file that has been removed will still be removed
              from pqiv's image list when it has been unloaded, i.e. if a user
              moves more than one image away from it. (See also --low-memory.)

ACTIONS
       Actions are the building blocks for controlling pqiv. The syntax for
       entering an action is
              COMMAND(PARAMETER)
       where COMMAND is one of the commands described in the following and
       PARAMETER is the command's parameter. Strings are not quoted. Instead,
       the closing parenthesis must be escaped by a backslash if it is used in
       a string. E.g., `command(echo \))' will output a single `)'. The
       available commands are:

       add_file(STRING)
              Add a file or directory.

       animation_step(INT)
              Stop an animation, and advance by the given number of frames
              plus one.

       animation_continue()
              Continue a stopped animation.

       animation_set_speed_relative(DOUBLE)
              Scale the animation's display speed.

       animation_set_speed_absolute(DOUBLE)
              Set the animation's display speed scale level to an absolute
              value. 1.0 is the animation's natural speed.

       bind_key(STRING)
              Override a key binding. Remember to quote closing parenthesis
              inside the new definition by prepending a backslash. Useful in
              conjunction with send_keys(STRING) to set up cyclic bindings.

       clear_marks()
              Clear all marks.

       command(STRING)
              Execute the given shell command. The syntax of the argument is
              the same as for the --command-1 option.

       flip_horizontally()
              Flip the current image horizontally.

       flip_vertically()
              Flip the current image vertically.

       goto_directory_relative(INT)
              Jump to the n'th next or previous directory.

       goto_earlier_file()
              Return to the image that was opened before the current one.

       goto_file_byindex(INT)
              Jump to a file given by its number.

       goto_file_byname(STRING)
              Jump to a file given by its displayed name.

       goto_file_relative(INT)
              Jump to the n'th next or previous file.

       goto_logical_directory_relative(INT)
              Jump to the n'th next or previous logical directory. Any multi-
              page documents, such as PDFs or archive files, are regarded as
              logical directories.  Directories within archive files,
              recognizable by a slash in the archive member's file name, are
              regarded as directories too. Basically, the rule is that two
              images are in the same logical directory if no character
              following the common prefix of their file names in either name
              is a slash or a hash symbol.

       hardlink_current_image()
              Hardlink the current image to ./.pqiv-select/, or copy it if
              hardlinking is not possible.

       jump_dialog()
              Display the jump dialog.

       montage_mode_enter()
              Enter montage mode, a view for interactive selection of images.

       montage_mode_follow(KEYS)
              Set up "follow" mode: Bind a sequence composed of the keys in
              KEYS to each visible thumbnail, such that typing that sequence
              moves the cursor to said position. At the same time, turn on
              binding overlays, increase the keyboard timeout, and revert
              everything after an image has been selected.

       montage_mode_return_proceed()
              Leave montage mode, and goto the currently selected image.

       montage_mode_return_cancel()
              Leave montage mode, and return to the last image viewed before
              entering montage mode.

       montage_mode_set_shift_x(INT)
              Set the horizontal cursor position in montage mode to an
              absolute value, indexed from 0.

       montage_mode_set_shift_y(INT)
              Set the vertical cursor position in montage mode to an absolute
              value, indexed from 0.

       montage_mode_set_wrap_mode(INT)
              Adjust how wrapping around edges works when shifting the cursor
              position in montage mode: The default, 1, is to wrap around rows
              but not around the whole image list. Set this to 0 to disable
              wrapping entirely. A value of 2 enables full wrapping.

       montage_mode_shift_x(INT)
              Shift the cursor in montage mode in horizontal direction. Shifts
              wrap around edges to the adjacent vertical lines, but not around
              the end of the list back to its beginning.

       montage_mode_shift_y(INT)
              Shift the cursor in montage mode in vertical direction.

       montage_mode_show_binding_overlays(INT)
              Disable (by using a parameter value of 0) or enable (by using
              any other value) follow mode. In follow mode, pqiv will draw
              mnemonics on top of each thumbnail that is reachable by typing a
              key (combination). Use this to realize keyboard navigation
              similar to vimperator/pentadactyl/vimium/etc.

       montage_mode_shift_y_pg(INT)
              Shift the cursor in montage mode in vertical direction by n
              pages.

       move_window(INT, INT)
              Move pqiv's window to the specified coordinates. Negative values
              center the window on the current monitor.

       nop()  Do nothing. Can be used to clear an existing binding.

       numeric_command(INT)
              Execute the n'th command defined via --command-1 etc.

       output_file_list()
              Output a list of all loaded files to the standard output.

       quit() Quit pqiv.

       reload()
              Reload the current image from disk.

       remove_file_byindex(INT)
              Remove a file given by its number.

       remove_file_byname(STRING)
              Remove a file given by its displayed name.

              Reset the scale level to the default value.

       rotate_left()
              Rotate the current image left by 90°.

       rotate_right()
              Rotate the current image right by 90°.

       send_keys(STRING)
              Emulate pressing a sequence of keys. This action currently does
              not support special keys that do not have an ASCII
              representation. Useful in conjunction with bind_key(STRING) to
              set up cyclic key bindings.

       set_cursor_visibility(INT)
              Set the visibility of the cursor; 0 disables, other values
              enable visibility.

       set_cursor_auto_hide(INT)
              Automatically show the cursor when the pointer moves, and hide
              it after one second of inactivity. Set to 0 to disable this
              feature or any other value to enable it. Note that this enables
              pointer movement events, which might slow down pqiv if it is
              used over slow network links.

       set_fade_duration(DOUBLE)
              Set the duration of fades between images. In contrast to the
              command line option, this action also implicitly enables fading.
              Set the duration to zero to disable the feature.

       set_interpolation_quality(INT)
              Set the interpolation quality for resized images. Options are: 0
              to cycle between the different modes, 1 for an automated choice
              based on the image size (small images use nearest interpolation,
              large ones Cairo's `good' mode), 2 for `fast', 3 for `good' and
              4 for `best'.

       set_keyboard_timeout(DOUBLE)
              Set the timeout for key sequence input. For example, if you bind
              something to a and another action to ab, pqiv will give you by
              default half a second to enter the b before assuming that you
              intended to type only a. Use this action to change this value.

       set_scale_level_absolute(DOUBLE)
              Set the scale level to the parameter value. 1.0 is 100%. See
              also --zoom-level.

       set_scale_level_relative(DOUBLE)
              Adjust the scale level multiplicatively by the parameter value.

       set_scale_mode_fit_px(INT, INT)
              Always adjust the scale level such that each image fits the
              given dimensions.

       set_scale_mode_screen_fraction(DOUBLE)
              Adjust how much of the available screen space is used for
              scaling the window outside fullscreen mode. Defaults to 0.8.
              This also affects the size of the montage mode window.

       set_shift_align_corner(STRING)
              Align the image to the window/screen border. Possible parameter
              values are the cardinal directions, e.g. NE will align the image
              to the north east, i.e. top right, corner. You can prepend the
              parameter by an additional C to perform the adjustment only if
              the image dimensions exceed the available space, and to center
              the image elsewise.

       set_shift_x(INT)
              Set the shift in horizontal direction to a fixed value.

       set_shift_y(INT)
              Set the shift in vertical direction to a fixed value.

       set_slideshow_interval_absolute(DOUBLE)
              Set the slideshow interval to the parameter value, in seconds.

       set_slideshow_interval_relative(DOUBLE)
              Adjust the slideshow interval additively by the parameter value.
              See also --slideshow-interval.

       set_status_output(INT)
              Set this to non-zero to make pqiv print status information for
              scripts to stdout, once upon activation and then whenever the
              user moves between images.  The format is compatible with shell
              variable definitions. Variables currently implemented are
              CURRENT_FILE_NAME and CURRENT_FILE_INDEX. An output sweep always
              ends with an empty line.

       set_thumbnail_preload(INT)
              Change the amount of thumbnails to be preloaded. A value of zero
              disables the feature.

       set_thumbnail_size(INT,INT)
              Change the size of thumbnails. The order of the arguments is
              width, then height. Thumbnails are always scaled such that no
              side is larger than this limit.

       shift_x(INT)
              Shift the current image in x direction.

       shift_y(INT)
              Shift the current image in y direction.

       toggle_background_pattern(INT)
              Toggle between the different background patterns: 0 to toggle, 1
              for checkerboard pattern, 2 for black, 3 for white.

       toggle_fullscreen(INT)
              Toggle fullscreen mode: 0 to toggle, 1 to go to fullscreen, 2 to
              return to window mode.

       toggle_info_box()
              Toggle the visibility of the info box.

       toggle_mark()
              Toggle the current image's mark.

       toggle_negate_mode(INT)
              Toggle negate (color inversion) mode: 0 to toggle, 1 to enable,
              2 to disable.

       toggle_scale_mode(INT)
              Change the scale mode: Use 1 to disable scaling, 2 for automated
              scaledown (default), 3 to always scale images up, 4 to maintain
              the user-set zoom level, and 5 to maintain the window's size.  0
              cycles through modes 1-3.

       toggle_shuffle_mode(INT)
              Toggle shuffle mode. Use 0 to cycle through the possible values,
              1 to enable shuffle, and any other value to disable it.

       This list omitted some advanced default bindings. The descriptions of
       the actions above is annotated with those bindings. You can also run
       `pqiv --show-bindings' to display a complete list.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       Upon startup, pqiv parses the file ~/.config/pqivrc. It should be a
       INI-style key/value file with an options section. All long form
       parameters are valid keys. To set a boolean flag, set the value to 1. A
       set flag inverts the meaning of the associated parameter. E.g., if you
       set `fullscreen=1', then pqiv will start in fullscreen mode unless you
       supply -f upon startup.

       As an example,
              [options]
              fullscreen=1
              sort=1
              command-1=|convert - -blur 20 -
       will make pqiv start in fullscreen by default, sort the file list and
       bind a blur filter to key 1. The -f flag on the command line will make
       pqiv not start in fullscreen, and -n will make it not sort the list.

       You can place key bindings in the format of the --bind-key parameter in
       a special [keybindings] section. E.g.,
              [keybindings]
              q { goto_file_relative(-1); }
              w { goto_file_relative(1); }

              x { send_keys(#1); }
              <numbersign>1 { set_scale_level_absolute(1.); bind_key(x { send_keys(#2\); }); }
              <numbersign>2 { set_scale_level_absolute(.5); bind_key(x { send_keys(#3\); }); }
              <numbersign>3 { set_scale_level_absolute(0.25); bind_key(x { send_keys(#1\); }); }
       will remap q and w to move between images, and set up x to cycle
       through 100%, 50% and 25% zoom levels.

       Similarly, you can also specify (multiple) actions to be executed each
       time pqiv is started in a section called [actions].

       For backwards compatibility with old versions of pqiv, if the file does
       not start with a section definition, the first line will be parsed as
       command line parameters.

       You may place comments into the file by beginning a line with `;' or
       `#'.  Comments at the end of a line are not supported.

       Other supported paths for the configuration file are ~/.pqivrc,
       /etc/xdg/pqivrc and /etc/pqivrc. pqiv will use whichever file it finds
       first. You can use the environment variable PQIVRC_PATH to override the
       configuration file.

EXAMPLES
       pqiv --bind-key="a { goto_file_byindex(0) }" --bind-key='c {
       command(echo -n $1 | xclip) }' --sort foo bar.pdf
              Rebinds a to go back to the first image, c to store the path to
              the current image to the clipboard using xclip and loads all
              files from the foo folder and bar.pdf, sorted.

       pqiv --slideshow --watch-directories --end-of-files-action=wait
       --slideshow-interval=0.001 test
              Load all files from the test folder in a slideshow progressing
              very fast, and in the end wait until new files become available.
              This effectively displays new images as they appear in a
              directory and is useful e.g. if you output images from a script
              that you later intent to combine into a movie and wish to
              monitor progress.

       pqiv --slideshow --allow-empty-window --watch-directories
       --wait-for-images-to-appear --lazy-load test
              Set up a slideshow that displays all images from the test folder
              such that it is possible to remove all images from the directory
              and place new ones into it afterwards without pqiv exiting.

       echo "output_file_list(); quit()" | pqiv --actions-from-stdin test
              Output a list of all files from the test folder that pqiv can
              handle and quit.
