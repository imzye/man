NAME
       mdcached - A high-performance cache daemon (Bullet Cache)

SYNOPSIS
       *mdcached* -h
       *mdcached* [-h] [-a] [-d] [-f file] [-i] [-k] [-m #] [-n #] [-r] [-s #] [-t #] [-v #]

DESCRIPTION
       The optional argument to mdcached are:

       -a
           Disable runtime monitoring and adaptive reconfiguration of the
           server.

       -d
           Enable debug mode: the server does not fork to background and
           displays the log messages on the terminal.

       -f
           file Set dump file name (for use with prewarming or with SIGUSR1).
           The server has the ability to create a dump file containing stored
           data. This dump may be created by sending the SIGUSR1 signal to the
           server, and it may be used to prewarm the server’s cache.

       -h
           Shows a help message with a short summary of available command line
           arguments

       -i #
           Automatically create a cache dump every # seconds.

       -k
           Bind network threads to worker threads. This option enables a
           performance optimization which may increase performance when worker
           threads are enabled. The most efficient case is when the number of
           worker threads equals the number of network threads.

       -m #
           Limits memory use to # MiB (default=0, disabled). Enabling memory
           limits may hurt performance in some cases. The limits are only
           enforced for the raw data stored in the memory database, and the
           actual memory usage (which includes internal book-keeping data) may
           be significantly higher

       -n #
           Set number of network threads to # (default=2). If Bullet Cache is
           used on dedicated servers, the most efficient configuration is to
           configure the number of network threads between 1 and 1.5 times the
           number of logical CPUs in the system.

       -r
           Read cache data from the dump file (prewarm the cache).

       -s #
           Set the default record size, in bytes. Correctly specifying the
           record size may result in significantly lower memory usage.

       -t #
           Set number of worker threads to # (default=0). Worker threads are
           useful only if the number of complex data queries is larger than
           the number of simple data queries. For normal workloads, worker
           threads are likely to reduce the overall performance.

       -v #
           Sets minimum log (verbosity) level to # [0-7]. The log level
           semantics (and numbering) resembles the ones used in syslog(3).

       Bullet Cache is a memory database intended to be used much like
       memcached, but offering much higher flexibility through use of record
       tags which can be used to perform bulk operations on sets of records.
       It has its own binary network protocol which is accessible through Unix
       domain sockets and through TCP. It is indended to be accessed through a
       high-performance C library.
