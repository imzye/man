Dancer::Plugin::FlashMessage(3)            User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Dancer::Plugin::FlashMessage - Dancer plugin to display temporary
       messages, so called "flash messages".

VERSION
       version 0.314

DESCRIPTION
       This plugin helps you display temporary messages, so called "flash
       messages".  It provides a flash() method to define the message. The
       plugin then takes care of attaching the content to the session,
       propagating it to the templating system, and then removing it from the
       session.

       However, it's up to you to have a place in your views or layout where
       the message will be displayed. But that's not too hard (see SYNOPSYS).

       Basically, the plugin gives you access to the 'flash' hash in your
       views. It can be used to display flash messages.

       By default, the plugin works using a decent configuration. However, you
       can change the behaviour of the plugin. See CONFIGURATION

NAME
       Dancer::Plugin::FlashMessage - A plugin to display "flash messages" :
       short temporary messages

SYNOPSYS
       Example with Template Toolkit

       In your configuration, make sure you have session configured. Of course
       you can use any session engine :

         session: "simple"

       In your index.tt view or in your layout :

         <% IF flash.error %>
           <div class=error> <% flash.error %> </div>
         <% END %>

       In your css :

         .error { background: #CEE5F5; padding: 0.5em;
                  border: 1px solid #AACBE2; }

       In your Dancer App :

         package MyWebService;

         use Dancer;
         use Dancer::Plugin::FlashMessage;

         get '/hello' => sub {
             flash error => 'Error message';
             template 'index';
         };

METHODS
   flash
         # sets the flash message for the warning key
         flash warning => 'some warning message';

         # retrieves and removes the flash message for the warning key
         my $warning_message = flash 'warning';

       This method can take 1 or 2 parameters. When called with two
       parameters, it sets the flash message for the given key.

       When called with one parameter, it returns the value of the flash
       message of the given key. The message is deleted from the flash hash in
       the session.

       In both cases, "flash" always returns the value;

IN YOUR TEMPLATE
       After having set a flash message using "flash" in your Dancer route,
       you can access the flash message from within your template. The plugin
       provides you with the "flash" hashref, that you can access in your
       template, for example like this :

         <div class=error> <% flash.error %> </div>

       When you use it in your template, the flash message is deleted. So next
       time, "flash.error" will not exist.

CONFIGURATION
       With no configuration whatsoever, the plugin will work fine, thus
       contributing to the keep it simple motto of Dancer.

   configuration default values
       These are the default values. See below for a description of the keys

         plugins:
           FlashMessage:
             token_name: flash
             session_hash_key: _flash

   configuration description
       token_name
           The name of the template token that will contain the hash of flash
           messages.  Default : "flash"

       session_hash_key
           You probably don't need that, but this setting allows you to change
           the name of the session key used to store the hash of flash
           messages. It may be useful in the unlikely case where you have key
           name conflicts in your session. Default : "_flash"
