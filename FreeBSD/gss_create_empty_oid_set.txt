GSS_CREATE_EMPTY_OID_SET(3)             FreeBSD Library Functions Manual (prm)

NAME
     gss_create_empty_oid_set – Create a set containing no object identifiers

SYNOPSIS
     #include <gssapi/gssapi.h>

     OM_uint32
     gss_create_empty_oid_set(OM_uint32 *minor_status, gss_OID_set *oid_set);

DESCRIPTION
     Create an object-identifier set containing no object identifiers, to
     which members may be subsequently added using the
     gss_add_oid_set_member() routine.  These routines are intended to be used
     to construct sets of mechanism object identifiers for input to
     gss_acquire_cred().

PARAMETERS
     minor_status      Mechanism specific status code.

     oid_set           The empty object identifier set.  The routine will
                       allocate the gss_OID_set_desc object, which the
                       application must free after use with a call to
                       gss_release_oid_set().

RETURN VALUES
     GSS_S_COMPLETE      Successful completion
