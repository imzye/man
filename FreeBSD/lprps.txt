PSREV(1)                FreeBSD General Commands Manual               PSREV(1)

NAME
       psrev - PostScript page reversal filter

SYNOPSIS
       psrev [ filename ]

DESCRIPTION
       psrev reverses the order of the pages of a PostScript document.
       Usually psrev is used with printers that stack face up and is run
       automatically by the spooler.  The document must conform to the Adobe
       Document Structuring Conventions, preferably version 3.0.

       psrev respects the %%PageOrder: comment: if this comment is present and
       has an argument other than Ascend the document will not be reversed.  A
       document reversed by psrev will contain a %%PageOrder: Descend comment.
