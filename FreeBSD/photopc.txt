NAME
       epinfo - extract technical information from digital camera generated
       files


SYNOPSIS
       epinfo [-h] [-V] [-z] [-r] [-t] [-f fmt] [-T <TagName>] <filename> ...


DESCRIPTION
       This command extracts the contents of TIFF directory of Exif files or
       APP12 marker from JFIF files, parses it and optionaly finds specific
       data inside it.  If used without -T, -r and -t options, dumps the
       complete block data in human readable format.  With -r and -t options,
       renames and changes timestamp of the files.


OPTIONS
       -h   This option produces a help screen of all options and commands.


       -V   This option prints software revision information.


       -z   This option sets no time-zone processing mode.  Use this option if
            the camera's clock is set up shifted by the local timezone offset
            (as it is when you set it manually to the local time).


       -r   Rename files, generating new name based on the time of snapshot
            and -f option value.


       -t   Set timestamp of the files to the time of snapshots.


       -f timeformat
            This option allows to specify the format for automatically
            generated image file names; the value is used as the format string
            for strftime(3) function.  By default, names of the format
            "MMDD_NNN.jpg" are generated, where MM is a month, DD is a day,
            and NNN is a count starting from 001.  A good starting point for
            the timeformat value could be "%Y_%m_%d-%H_%M_%S.jpg".  If the
            format string contains context "%%XXXd" where XXX are digits, it
            is taken for the count, i.e. if the file with such name is
            present, next count is tried.  If the format string does not
            contain "%%XXXd" part, the count field, if necessary, is appended
            at the end of the name.

            A few single-character formats are used as shortcuts.  "x" makes
            the name of seconds since the epoch in hexadecimal format (8
            characters + ".jpg"), "d" - the same in decimal format (10
            characters), "1" stands for default format "%m%d_%%03d.jpg", "2"
            stands for "%y%m%d%%02d.jpg", "3" stands for
            "%Y_%m_%d-%H_%M_%S.jpg" and 4 stands for "%Y/%m/%d/%H_%M_%S.jpg".
            The program attempts to create intermediate directories is
            necessary (and possible).


       -T <TagName>
            Output the value of this keyword in the information block.  Note
            that keywords are case sensitive.  TagName DateTime has special
            meaning: if the file is Exif, it just prints the value of DateTime
            tag, and if the format is old APP12, it outputs the value of
            TimeDate tag in the same format as Exif DateTime.


ARGUMENTS
       <filename> ...
            List of filenames to process.


EXAMPLES
       % epinfo -f3 -rt pic00001.jpg

       % epinfo -T FNumber 0512_003.jpg
