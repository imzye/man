NAME
       wl-clipboard - Wayland copy and paste command line utilities

SYNOPSIS
       wl-copy [--primary] [--type mime/type] [text...]

       wl-paste [--primary] [--type mime/type]

       Only the most useful options are listed here; see below for the full
       list.

DESCRIPTION
       wl-copy copies the given text to the Wayland clipboard.  If no text is
       given, wl-copy copies data from its standard input.

       wl-paste pastes data from the Wayland clipboard to its standard output.

       Although wl-copy and wl-paste are particularly optimized for plain text
       and other textual content formats, they fully support content of
       arbitrary MIME types. wl-copy automatically infers the type of the
       copied content by running xdg-mime(1) on it. wl-paste tries its best to
       pick a type to paste based on the list of offered MIME types and the
       extension of the file it's pasting into. If you're not satisfied with
       the type they pick or don't want to rely on this implicit type
       inference, you can explicitly specify the type to use with the --type
       option.

OPTIONS
       To parse options, wl-clipboard uses the getopt(3) library routines,
       whose features depend on the C library in use. In particular, it may be
       possible to specify -- as an argument on its own to prevent any further
       arguments from getting parsed as options (which lets you copy text
       containing words that start with the - sign), and to shorten long
       options to their unambiguous prefixes.

       -p, --primary
              Use the "primary" clipboard instead of the regular clipboard.

       -o, --paste-once (for wl-copy)
              Only serve one paste request and then exit. Unless a clipboard
              manager specifically designed to prevent this is in use, this
              has the effect of clearing the clipboard after the first paste,
              which is useful for copying sensitive data such as passwords.
              Note that this may break pasting into some clients that expect
              to be able to paste multiple times, in particular pasting into
              XWayland windows is known to break when this option is used.

       -f, --foreground (for wl-copy)
              By default, wl-copy forks and serves data requests in the
              background; this option overrides that behavior, causing wl-copy
              to run in the foreground.

       -c, --clear (for wl-copy)
              Instead of copying anything, clear the clipboard so that nothing
              is copied.

       -n, --trim-newline (for wl-copy)
              Do not copy the trailing newline character if it is present in
              the input file.

       -n, --no-newline (for wl-paste)
              Do not append a newline character after the pasted clipboard
              content. This option is automatically enabled for non-text
              content types and when using the --watch mode.

       -t mime/type, --type mime/type
              Override the automatically selected MIME type. For wl-copy this
              option controls which type wl-copy will offer the content as.
              For wl-paste it controls which of the offered types wl-paste
              will request the content in. In addition to specific MIME types
              such as image/png, wl-paste also accepts generic type names such
              as text and image which make it automatically pick some offered
              MIME type that matches the given generic name.

       -s seat-name, --seat seat-name
              Specify which seat wl-copy and wl-paste should work with.
              Wayland natively supports multi-seat configurations where each
              seat gets its own mouse pointer, keyboard focus, and among other
              things its own separate clipboard. The name of the default seat
              is likely default or seat0, and additional seat names normally
              come from the udev(7) property ENV{WL_SEAT}. You can view the
              list of the currently available seats as advertised by the
              compositor using the weston-info(1) tool. If you don't specify
              the seat name explicitly, wl-copy and wl-paste will pick a seat
              arbitrarily. If you are using a single-seat system, there is
              little reason to use this option.

       -l, --list-types (for wl-paste)
              Instead of pasting the selection, output the list of MIME types
              it is offered in.

       -w command..., --watch command... (for wl-paste)
              Instead of pasting once and exiting, continuously watch the
              clipboard for changes, and run the specified command each time a
              new selection appears.  The spawned process can read the
              clipboard contents from its standard input.  wl-paste also sets
              the CLIPBOARD_STATE variable in the environment of the spawned
              processes (see below).

              This mode requires a compositor that supports the wlroots data-
              control protocol.

       -v, --version
              Display the version of wl-clipboard and some short info about
              its license.

       -h, --help
              Display a short help message listing the available options.

ENVIRONMENT
       WAYLAND_DISPLAY
              Specifies what Wayland server wl-copy and wl-paste should
              connect to. This is the same environment variable that you pass
              to other Wayland clients, such as graphical applications, that
              connect to this Wayland server. It is normally set up
              automatically by the graphical session and the Wayland
              compositor. See wl_display_connect(3) for more details.

       WAYLAND_DEBUG
              When set to 1, causes the wayland-client(7) library to log every
              interaction wl-copy and wl-paste make with the Wayland
              compositor to stderr.

       CLIPBOARD_STATE
              Set by wl-paste for the spawned command in --watch mode.
              Currently the following possible values are defined:

              CLIPBOARD_STATE=data
                     Indicates that the clipboard contains data that the
                     spawned command can read from its standard input. This is
                     the most common case.

              CLIPBOARD_STATE=nil
                     Indicates that the clipboard is empty. In this case the
                     spawned command's standard input will be attached to
                     /dev/null. Note that this is subtly different from the
                     clipboard containing zero-sized data (which can be
                     achieved, for instance, by running wl-copy < /dev/null).

              CLIPBOARD_STATE=clear
                     Indicates that the clipboard is empty because of an
                     explicit clear request, such as after running wl-copy
                     --clear. As for nil, the command's standard input will be
                     attached to /dev/null.

              CLIPBOARD_STATE=sensitive
                     Indicates that the clipboard contains sensitive data such
                     as a password or a key. It is probably best to avoid
                     visibly displaying or persistently saving clipboard
                     contents.

              Any client programs implementing the CLIPBOARD_STATE protocol
              are encouraged to implement proper support for all the values
              listed above, as well as to fall back to some sensible behavior
              if CLIPBOARD_STATE is unset or set to some unrecognized value
              (this is to leave the design space open for future extensions).
              However, the currently existing Wayland clipboard protocols
              don't let wl-clipboard identify the cases where clear and
              sensitive values should be set, so currently wl-clipboard only
              ever sets CLIPBOARD_STATE to data or nil.

              The CLIPBOARD_STATE protocol was intentionally designed to not
              be specific to either wl-clipboard or Wayland; in fact, other
              clipboard tools are encouraged to implement the same protocol.
              Currently, the SerenityOS paste(1) utility is known to implement
              the same CLIPBOARD_STATE protocol.

FILES
       /usr/local/etc/mime.types
              If present, read by wl-paste to infer the MIME type to paste in
              based on the file name extension of its standard output.

BUGS
       Unless the Wayland compositor implements the wlroots data-control
       protocol, wl-clipboard has to resort to using a hack to access the
       clipboard: it will briefly pop up a tiny transparent surface (window).
       On some desktop environments (in particular when using tiling window
       managers), this can cause visual issues such as brief flashing. In some
       cases the Wayland compositor doesn't give focus to the popup surface,
       which prevents wl-clipboard from accessing the clipboard and manifests
       as a hang.

       There is currently no way to copy data in multiple MIME types, such as
       multiple image formats, at the same time.
       See <https://github.com/bugaevc/wl-clipboard/issues/71>.

       wl-clipboard is not always able to detect that a MIME type is textual,
       which may break pasting into clients that expect textual formats, not
       application/something. The workaround, same as for all format inference
       issues, is to specify the desired MIME type explicitly, such as wl-copy
       --type text/plain.

       wl-copy --clear and wl-copy --paste-once don't always interact well
       with clipboard managers that are overeager to preserve clipboard
       contents.

       Applications written using the GTK 3 toolkit copy text with "\r\n"
       (also known as CR LF) line endings, which takes most other software by
       surprise.  wl-cipboard does nothing to rectify this. The recommended
       workaround is piping wl-paste output through dos2unix(1) when pasting
       from a GTK 3 application.
       See <https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/issues/2307>.

       When trying to paste content copied with wl-copy, wl-copy does not
       check whether the requested MIME type is among those it has offered,
       and always provides the same data in response.

EXAMPLES
       Copy a simple text message:
              $ wl-copy Hello world!

       Copy a message starting with dashes:
              wl-copy -- --long

       Copy the list of files in ~/Downloads:
              $ ls ~/Downloads | wl-copy

       Copy an image:
              $ wl-copy < ~/Pictures/photo.png

       Copy the previous command:
              $ wl-copy "!!"

       Paste to a file, without appending a newline:
              $ wl-paste -n > clipboard.txt

       Sort clipboard contents:
              $ wl-paste | sort | wl-copy

       Upload clipboard contents to a pastebin on each change:
              $ wl-paste --watch nc paste.example.org 5555
