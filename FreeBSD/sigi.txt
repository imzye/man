NAME
       sigi - An organizing tool for terminal lovers who hate organizing

SYNOPSIS
       sigi [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] [SUBCOMMAND]

DESCRIPTION
       Use sigi as extra memory. Use it to organize your tasks, groceries, or
       the next board games you want to play... as stacks! Shell aliases are
       strongly encouraged to organize your various stacks.

       Sigi is the Chamorro word for continue.  I hope this will help you to
       plan more, forget less, get things done, and relax.

FLAGS
       -h, --help
              Prints help information.

       -q, --quiet
              Omit any leading labels or symbols. Recommended for use in shell
              scripts.

       -s, --silent
              Omit any output at all.

       -V, --version
              Prints version information.

       -v, --verbose [Aliases: --noisy]
              Prints more information, like when an item was created.

OPTIONS
       -f, --format <FORMAT>
              Use a programmatic FORMAT. Options include: [csv, json, json-
              compact, tsv]

       -t, --stack <STACK> [Or: --topic, --about, --namespace <STACK>]
              Manage items in a specific STACK. If no STACK is provided, it
              will use "sigi" by default. It's recommended to use shell
              aliases to access your stacks. (See EXAMPLES below.)

       -d, --data-store <DATA_STORE>
              (Advanced) Manage sigi stacks in a specific directory. The
              default is either the value of a SIGI_HOME environment variable
              or your OS-specific home directory [aliases: dir, directory,
              store]

SUBCOMMANDS
       -      Read input lines from standard input. Same commands as
              interactive mode, but only prints for printing commands.

       next   Cycle to the next item; the current item becomes last [aliases:
              later, cycle, bury]

       peek   Print the first item. (This is the default behavior when no
              command is given) [aliases: show]

       pick   Move items to the top of stack by their number

       swap   Swap the two most-current items

       tail   Print the last N items [aliases: bottom, last]

INTERACTIVE MODE
       Use subcommands in interactive mode directly. For example:
              🌴 ▶ push a new thing
              Created: a new thing
              🌴 ▶ peek
              Now: a new thing
              🌴 ▶ delete
              Deleted: a new thing
              Now: nothing
              🌴 ▶ exit
              exit: Buen biåhe!

       No OPTIONS (flags) of subcommands are understood in interactive mode.

       The ; character can be used to separate commands.

              clear  Clear the terminal screen
