NAME
       iconv - charset conversion utility


SYNOPSIS
       iconv -f from_charset -t to_charset [ -s inputstring | file...  ]


DESCRIPTION
       The iconv utility converts the characters or sequences of characters in
       file(s) (or inputstring if specified with the -s option) from one
       charset to another and writes the results to standard output. Should no
       conversion exist for a particular character then it is converted to the
       underscore '_' in the target charset.

       The list of supported conversions and the locations of the associated
       conversion tables are provided in the iconv(3) manual page.


OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       -f from_charset
                      Identifies the input charset.

       -t to_charset  Identifies the output charset.

       -s inputstring Identifies the character sequence, which is to be
                      converted instead of input files.


OPERANDS
       The following operands are supported:

       file(s)        A list of the input files to be translated.  '-' means
                      the standard input.  If file is omitted, the standard
                      input is used.


EXAMPLES
       The following example converts the contents of file mail1 from charset
       iso-8859-5 to utf-8 and stores the results in file mail.local.

              example% iconv -f iso-8859-5 -t utf-8 mail1 > mail.local

ENVIRONMENT
       See iconv(3) for the description of the ICONV_PATH environment variable
       that affects the behaviour of iconv.
