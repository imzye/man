Class::Accessor::Lvalue(3)                 User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Class::Accessor::Lvalue - create Lvalue accessors

SYNOPSIS
        package Foo;
        use base qw( Class::Accessor::Lvalue );
        __PACKAGE__->mk_accessors(qw( bar ))

        my $foo = Foo->new;
        $foo->bar = 42;
        print $foo->bar; # prints 42

DESCRIPTION
       This module subclasses Class::Accessor in order to provide lvalue
       accessor makers.

CAVEATS
       •   Though Class::Accessor mutators allows for the setting of multiple
           values to an attribute, the mutators that this module creates
           handle single scalar values only.  This should not be too much of a
           hinderance as you can still explictly use an anonymous array.

       •   Due to the hoops we have to jump through to preserve the
           Class::Accessor ->get and ->set behaviour this module is
           potentially slow.  Should you not need the flexibility granted by
           the ->get and ->set methods, it's highly reccomended that you use
           Class::Accessor::Lvalue::Fast which is simpler and much faster.
