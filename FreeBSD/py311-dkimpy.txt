NAME
       arcsign - Script for ARC signing messages on stdin

VERSION
       0.9.2


DESCRIPTION
       arcsign is a filter that reads an RFC822 message on standard input, and
       writes the same message on standard output with a ARC-Signature lines
       prepended.


USAGE
       The signing options are specified on the command line:

       arcsign selector domain privatekeyfile srv_id

       Note: arcsign will only use authentication results header fields with
       an authserv-id that matches srv_id as the input fields for the ARC
       chain.
