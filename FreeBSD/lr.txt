LR(1)                   FreeBSD General Commands Manual                  LR(1)

NAME
     lr – list files, recursively

SYNOPSIS
     lr [-0 | -F | -l [-TA | -TC | -TM] | -S | -f fmt]
        [-B | -D] [-H | -L] [-1AGPQXdhsx] [-U | -W | -o ord]
        [-e regex] [-t test] [-C [color:]path] path_...

DESCRIPTION
     lr is a versatile tool to generate file listings with configurable
     formatting, ordering and filtering.

     When no path is given or path is an empty string, the current directory
     is used by default.

     The special path argument ‘-’ makes lr read file names from standard
     input, instead of traversing path.  Likewise, the special path argument
     @file makes lr read file names from file.

     By default, lr traverses directories before their entries.  When -D is
     used, the subdirectories (and files) are traversed first.  When -B is
     used, each level of depth is traversed before moving deeper.

     The options are as follows:

     -0      Output filenames separated by NUL bytes.  Likewise, read input
             filenames separated by NUL bytes.

     -1      Don't go below one level of directories.

     -A      Don't list files starting with a dot.

     -B      Use breadth first traversal.  For each depth of the directory
             tree, files are sorted and printed, then the next depth is looked
             at.

     -C [color:]path
             Behaves as if path was passed like an ordinary argument, but
             overrides the color of the file names to the number color which
             must be between 0 and 255 (default: 2, green).

             Implies -GG.

     -D      Use depth first traversal.  prune will not work, but entries and
             total are computed on the fly.

     -F      Output filenames and an indicator of their file type (one of
             ‘*/=>@|’).

     -G      Colorize output to TTY.  Use twice to force colorized output.  If
             the environment variable NO_COLOR is set, colors are never used.

     -H      Only follow symlinks on command line (default: don't follow
             symlinks).

     -L      Follow all symlinks.

     -P      Quote file names using Austin Group #249 syntax $'...' (implies
             -Q).

     -Q      Quote file names (default for output to TTY).

     -S      Output inspired by BSD stat(1) (implies -Q).

     -TA     With -l, print atime.

     -TC     With -l, print ctime.

     -TM     With -l, print mtime.  This is the default.

     -U      Don't sort results, print during traversal.

     -W      Sort results by name and print during traversal.  (This is subtly
             different from sorting by file name with -on as it prints
             directories directly before their contents.)

     -X      Output OSC 8 hyperlinks to TTY.  Use twice to force hyperlinks.

     -d      Don't enter directories.

     -e regex
             Only show files where basename matches the POSIX ERE regex.

     -f fmt  Custom formatting, see FORMATTING.

     -h      Print human readable size for -l (also %s).

     -l      Long output a la ‘ls -l’ (implies -Q).

     -o ord  Sort according to ord, see SORT ORDER.

     -s      Strip directory prefix passed on command line.

     -t test
             Only show files matching the expression test, see TESTS.
             Multiple occurrences of -t and -e are regarded as a conjunction.

     -x      Don't enter other filesystems.

FORMATTING
     lr format strings support the following escape sequences:

     \a, \b, \f, \n, \r, \v
             Special characters as in C
     \ddd    Byte with one, two or three-digit octal value
     \xdd    Byte with one or two-digit hexadecimal value
     %%      A plain ‘%’
     %s      File size in bytes
     %S      File size, with human readable unit
     %b      File size in 512-byte blocks
     %k      File size in 1024-byte blocks
     %d      Path depth
     %D      Device number (stat.st_dev)
     %R      Device ID for special files (stat.st_rdev)
     %i      Inode number
     %I      One space character for every depth level
     %p      Full path (%P if -s is used)
     %P      Full path without command line argument prefix
     %l      Symlink target
     %n      Number of hardlinks
     %F      File indicator type symbol (one of ‘*/=>@|’)
     %f      File basename (everything after last /)
     %A-, %C-, %T-
             relative age for atime/ctime/mtime.
     %Ax, %Cx, %Tx
             result of strftime(3) for %x on atime/ctime/mtime
     %m      Octal file permissions
     %M      ls-style symbolic file permissions
     %y      ls-style symbolic file type (‘bcdfls’)
     %g      Group name
     %G      Numeric gid
     %u      User name
     %U      Numeric uid
     %e      Number of entries in directories
     %t      Total size used by accepted files in directories (only with -D)
     %Y      Type of the filesystem the file resides on
     %x      Linux-only: Print a combination of ‘#’ for files with security
             capabilities, ‘+’ for files with an ACL, ‘@’ for files with other
             extended attributes

SORT ORDER
     Sort order is string consisting of the following letters.  Uppercase
     letters reverse sorting.  Default sort order is ‘n’.

     a       atime
     c       ctime
     d       path depth
     e       file extension
     f       file basename
     i       inode number
     m       mtime
     n       file name
     p       directory name
     s       file size
     t       file type.  This sorts all directories before other files.
     v       file name as version numbers (sorts ‘2’ before ‘10’)

     E.g. ‘Sn’ sorts first by size, smallest last, and then by name (in case
     sizes are equal).
