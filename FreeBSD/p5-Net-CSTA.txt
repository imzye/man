NAME
       Net::CSTA - Perl extension for ECMA CSTA

SYNOPSIS
         use Net::CSTA;

         # Connect to the CSTA server
         my $csta = Net::CSTA->new(Host=>'csta-server',Port=>'csta-server-port');
         # Create a monitor for '555'
         my $number = 555;
         $csta->request(serviceID=>71,
                                    serviceArgs=>{monitorObject=>{device=>{dialingNumber=>$number}}})

         for (;;)
         {
                my $pdu = $csta->receive();
                print $pdu->toXML();
         }

DESCRIPTION
       ECMA CSTA is an ASN.1 based protocol for Computer Integrated Telephony
       (CTI) using CSTA it is possible to write code that communicates with a
       PBX. Typical applications include receiving notifications for incoming
       calls, placing calls, redirecting calls or placing conference calls.

BUGS
       This module currently implements CSTA phase I - mostly because my PBX
       (MD110 with Application Link 4.0) only supports phase I. Supporting
       multiple versions will require some thought since the versions are
       largly incompatible.

       The CSTA client opens a UDP port on 3333 to receive incoming usolicited
       notifications.  This is not implemented yet.

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
       CSTA is a protocol devoid of any form of security. Take care to
       firewall your CSTA server and throw away the key.
