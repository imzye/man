NAME
       GPS::OID - Package for GPS PRN - Object ID conversions.

SYNOPSIS
         use GPS::OID;
         my $obj = GPS::OID->new();
         print "PRN: ", $obj->prn_oid(22231), "\n";
         print "OID: ", $obj->oid_prn(1), "\n";

DESCRIPTION
       This module maps GPS PRN number to Satellite OID and vice versa.

   Object Identification Number (OID)
       The catalog number assigned to the object by the US Air Force. The
       numbers are assigned sequentially as objects are cataloged. This is the
       most common way to search for TLE data on this site.

       Object numbers less then 10000 are always aligned to the right, and
       padded with zeros or spaces to the left.

   Pseudo Random Numbers (PRNs)
       GPS satellites are identified by the receiver by means of PRN-numbers.
       Real GPS satellites are numbered from 1 - 32. WAAS/EGNOS satellites and
       other pseudolites are assigned higher numbers.  The PRN-numbers of the
       satellites appear on the satellite view screens of many GPS receivers.

CONVENTIONS
       Function naming convention is "format of the return" underscore "format
       of the parameters."

CONSTRUCTOR
   new
       The new() constructor

         my $obj = GPS::OID->new();

METHODS
   initialize
   prn_oid
       PRN given Object ID.

         my $prn=prn_oid(22231);

   oid_prn
       Object ID given PRN.

         my $oid=oid_prn(1);

   listprn
       List all known PRNs.

         my @prn=$obj->listprn;
         my $prn=$obj->listprn;

   listoid
       List all known OIDs.

         my @oid=$obj->listoid;
         my $oid=$obj->listoid;

   data
       OID to PRN hash reference

         my $data=$self->data;

   overload
       Adds or overloads new OID/PRN pairs.

         $obj->overload($oid=>$prn);

   reset
       Resets overloaded OID/PRN pairs to package defaults.

         $obj->reset;
