REM(1)                         VERSION 05.04.02                         REM(1)

NAME
       rem - Invoke Remind with a default filename

SYNOPSIS
       rem [options] [date] [*rep] [time]

DESCRIPTION
       rem is a symbolic link to remind.  When remind determines that it has
       been invoked as rem, it uses a default filename rather than expecting a
       filename to be supplied on the command line.

       If the environment variable DOTREMINDERS is set, remind uses the value
       of DOTREMINDERS as the filename.  Otherwise, remind uses the filename
       $HOME/.reminders
