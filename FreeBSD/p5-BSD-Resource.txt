DESCRIPTION
   getrusage
               ($usertime, $systemtime,
                $maxrss, $ixrss, $idrss, $isrss, $minflt, $majflt, $nswap,
                $inblock, $oublock, $msgsnd, $msgrcv,
                $nsignals, $nvcsw, $nivcsw) = getrusage($ru_who);

               $rusage = getrusage($ru_who);

               # $ru_who argument is optional; it defaults to RUSAGE_SELF

               $rusage = getrusage();

       The $ru_who argument is either "RUSAGE_SELF" (the current process) or
       "RUSAGE_CHILDREN" (all the child processes of the current process) or
       it maybe left away in which case "RUSAGE_SELF" is used.

       The "RUSAGE_CHILDREN" is the total sum of all the so far terminated
       (either successfully or unsuccessfully) child processes: there is no
       way to find out information about child processes still running.

       On some systems (those supporting both getrusage() with the POSIX
       threads) there can also be "RUSAGE_THREAD". The BSD::Resource supports
       the "RUSAGE_THREAD" if it is present but understands nothing more about
       the POSIX threads themselves.  Similarly for "RUSAGE_BOTH": some
       systems support retrieving the sums of the self and child resource
       consumptions simultaneously.

       In list context getrusage() returns the current resource usages as a
       list. On failure it returns an empty list.

       The elements of the list are, in order:      index     name
                 meaning usually (quite system dependent)

                0      utime           user time
                1      stime           system time
                2      maxrss          maximum shared memory or current resident set
                3      ixrss           integral shared memory
                4      idrss           integral or current unshared data
                5      isrss           integral or current unshared stack
                6      minflt          page reclaims
                7      majflt          page faults
                8      nswap           swaps
                9      inblock         block input operations
               10      oublock         block output operations
               11      msgsnd          messages sent
               12      msgrcv          messaged received
               13      nsignals        signals received
               14      nvcsw           voluntary context switches
               15      nivcsw          involuntary context switches

       In scalar context getrusage() returns the current resource usages as a
       an object. The object can be queried via methods named exactly like the
       middle column, name, in the above table.

               $ru = getrusage();
               print $ru->stime, "\n";

               $total_context_switches = $ru->nvcsw + $ru->nivcsw;

       For a detailed description about the values returned by getrusage()
       please consult your usual C programming documentation about getrusage()
       and also the header file "<sys/resource.h>".  (In Solaris, this might
       be "<sys/rusage.h>").

       See also "KNOWN ISSUES".

       What limits are available depends on the operating system.

       See below for get_rlimits() on how to find out which limits are
       available, for the exact documentation consult the documentation of
       your operating system (setrlimit documentation, usually).

       The two groups ("NOFILE", "OFILE", "OPEN_MAX") and ("AS", "VMEM") are
       aliases within themselves.

       Two meta-resource-symbols might exist

               RLIM_NLIMITS
               RLIM_INFINITY

       "RLIM_NLIMITS" being the number of possible (but not necessarily fully
       supported) resource limits, see also the get_rlimits() call below.
       "RLIM_INFINITY" is useful in setrlimit(), the "RLIM_INFINITY" is often
       represented as minus one (-1).

       In list context getrlimit() returns the current soft and hard resource
       limits as a list.  On failure it returns an empty list.

       Processes have soft and hard resource limits.  On crossing the soft
       limit they receive a signal (for example the "SIGXCPU" or "SIGXFSZ",
       corresponding to the "RLIMIT_CPU" and "RLIMIT_FSIZE", respectively).
       The processes can trap and handle some of these signals, please see
       "Signals" in perlipc.  After the hard limit the processes will be
       ruthlessly killed by the "KILL" signal which cannot be caught.

       NOTE: the level of 'support' for a resource varies. Not all the systems

               a) even recognise all those limits
               b) really track the consumption of a resource
               c) care (send those signals) if a resource limit is exceeded

       Again, please consult your usual C programming documentation.

       One notable exception for the better: officially HP-UX does not support
       getrlimit() at all but for the time being, it does seem to.

       In scalar context getrlimit() returns the current soft limit.  On
       failure it returns "undef".

   getpriority
               # $pr_which can be PRIO_USER, PRIO_PROCESS, or PRIO_PGRP,
               # and in some systems PRIO_THREAD

               $nowpriority = getpriority($pr_which, $pr_who);

               # the default $pr_who is 0 (the current $pr_which)

               $nowpriority = getpriority($pr_which);

               # the default $pr_which is PRIO_PROCESS (the process priority)

               $nowpriority = getpriority();

       getpriority() returns the current priority. NOTE: getpriority() can
       return zero or negative values completely legally. On failure
       getpriority() returns "undef" (and $! is set as usual).

       The priorities returned by getpriority() are in the (inclusive) range
       "PRIO_MIN"..."PRIO_MAX".  The $pr_which argument can be any of
       PRIO_PROCESS (a process) "PRIO_USER" (a user), or "PRIO_PGRP" (a
       process group). The $pr_who argument tells which process/user/process
       group, 0 signifying the current one.

       Usual values for "PRIO_MIN", "PRIO_MAX", are -20, 20.  A negative value
       means better priority (more impolite process), a positive value means
       worse priority (more polite process).

   setrlimit
               $success = setrlimit($resource, $newsoft, $newhard);

       setrlimit() returns true on success and "undef" on failure.

       NOTE: A normal user process can only lower its resource limits.  Soft
       or hard limit "RLIM_INFINITY" means as much as possible, the real hard
       limits are normally buried inside the kernel and are very system-
       dependent.

       NOTE: Even the soft limit that is actually set might be lower than what
       requested for various reasons.  One possibility is that the actual
       limit on a resource might be controlled by some system variable (e.g.
       in BSD systems the RLIMIT_NPROC can be capped by the system variable
       "maxprocperuid", try "sysctl -a kern.maxprocperuid"), or in many
       environments core dumping has been disabled from normal user processes.
       Another possibility is that a limit is rounded down to some alignment
       or granularity, for example the memory limits might be rounded down to
       the closest 4 kilobyte boundary.  In other words, do not expect to be
       able to setrlimit() a limit to a value and then be able to read back
       the same value with getrlimit().

   setpriority
               $success = setpriority($pr_which, $pr_who, $priority);

               # NOTE! If there are two arguments the second one is
               # the new $priority (not $pr_who) and the $pr_who is
               # defaulted to 0 (the current $pr_which)

               $success = setpriority($pr_which, $priority);

               # The $pr_who defaults to 0 (the current $pr_which) and
               # the $priority defaults to half of the PRIO_MAX, usually
               # that amounts to 10 (being a nice $pr_which).

               $success = setpriority($pr_which);

               # The $pr_which defaults to PRIO_PROCESS.

               $success = setpriority();

       setpriority() is used to change the scheduling priority.  A positive
       priority means a more polite process/process group/user; a negative
       priority means a more impolite process/process group/user.  The
       priorities handled by setpriority() are ["PRIO_MIN","PRIO_MAX"].  A
       normal user process can only lower its priority (make it more
       positive).

       NOTE: A successful call returns 1, a failed one 0.

       See also "KNOWN ISSUES".

   times
               use BSD::Resource qw(times);

               ($user, $system, $child_user, $child_system) = times();

       The BSD::Resource module offers a times() implementation that has
       usually slightly better time granularity than the times() by Perl core.
       The time granularity of the latter is usually 1/60 seconds while the
       former may achieve submilliseconds.

       NOTE: The current implementation uses two getrusage() system calls: one
       with RUSAGE_SELF and one with RUSAGE_CHILDREN.  Therefore the operation
       is not `atomic': the times for the children are recorded a little bit
       later.

       NOTE: times() is not imported by default by BSD::Resource.  You need to
       tell that you want to use it.

       NOTE: times() is not a "real BSD" function.  It is older UNIX.

   get_rlimits
               use BSD::Resource qw{get_rlimits};
               my $limits = get_rlimits();

       NOTE: This is not a real BSD function. It is a convenience function
       introduced by BSD::Resource.

       get_rlimits() returns a reference to hash which has the names of the
       available resource limits as keys and their indices (those which are
       needed as the first argument to getrlimit() and setrlimit()) as values.
       For example:

               use BSD::Resource qw{get_rlimits};
               my $limits = get_rlimits();
               for my $name (keys %$limits) {
                 my ($soft, $hard) = BSD::Resource::getrlimit($limits->{$name});
                 print "$name soft $soft hard $hard\n";
               }

       Note that a limit of -1 means unlimited.

ERRORS
       •


                   Your vendor has not defined BSD::Resource macro ...

           The code tried to call getrlimit/setrlimit for a resource limit
           that your operating system vendor/supplier does not support.
           Portable code should use get_rlimits() to check which resource
           limits are defined.

EXAMPLES
               # the user and system times so far by the process itself

               ($usertime, $systemtime) = getrusage();

               # ditto in OO way

               $ru = getrusage();

               $usertime   = $ru->utime;
               $systemtime = $ru->stime;

               # get the current priority level of this process

               $currprio = getpriority();

KNOWN ISSUES
       In AIX (at least version 3, maybe later also releases) if the BSD
       compatibility library is not installed or not found by the
       BSD::Resource installation procedure and when using the getpriority()
       or setpriority(), the "PRIO_MIN" is 0 (corresponding to -20) and
       "PRIO_MAX" is 39 (corresponding to 19, the BSD priority 20 is
       unreachable).

       In HP-UX the getrusage() is not Officially Supported at all but for the
       time being, it does seem to be.

       In Mac OS X a normal user cannot raise the "RLIM_NPROC" over the
       maxprocperuid limit (the default value is 266, try the command "sysctl
       -a kern.maxprocperuid").

       In NetBSD "RLIMIT_STACK" setrlimit() calls fail.

       In Cygwin "RLIMIT_STACK" setrlimit calls fail.  Also, setrlimit()
       "RLIMIT_NOFILE/RLIMIT_OFILE/RLIMIT_OFILE" calls return success, but
       then the subsequent getrlimit calls show that the limits didn't really
       change.

       Because not all UNIX kernels are BSD and also because of the sloppy
       support of getrusage() by many vendors many of the getrusage() values
       may not be correctly updated.  For example Solaris 1 claims in
       "<sys/rusage.h>" that the "ixrss" and the "isrss" fields are always
       zero.  In SunOS 5.5 and 5.6 the getrusage() leaves most of the fields
       zero and therefore getrusage() is not even used, instead of that the
       /proc interface is used.  The mapping is not perfect: the "maxrss"
       field is really the current resident size instead of the maximum, the
       "idrss" is really the current heap size instead of the integral data,
       and the "isrss" is really the current stack size instead of the
       integral stack.  The ixrss has no sensible counterpart at all so it
       stays zero.
