NAME
       bfort -  program to extract short definitions for a Fortran to C
       interface

INPUT
       filenames
              - Names the files from which lint definitions are to be
              extracted
       -nomsgs
              - Do not generate messages for routines that can not be
              converted to Fortran.
       -nofort
              - Generate messages for all routines/macros without a Fortran
              counterpart.
       -dir name
              - Directory for output file
       -I name
              - file that contains common includes
       -mapptr
              - translate pointers to integer indices
       -ptrprefix
              - prefix for names of functions to convert to/from pointers
              (default is __).  The macro that selects the form based on the
              pointer size can be changed with -ptr64.
       -anyname
              - Generate a single Fortran wrapper that works for almost all
              systems, by adding C preprocessor names (see below).  These
              names can be changed with -fcaps, -fuscore, and -fduscore.
       -ferr  - Fortran versions return the value of the routine as the last
              argument (an integer).  This is used in MPI and is a not
              uncommon approach for handling error returns.
       -mpi   - Handle MPI datatypes (some things are pointers by definition)
       -mpi2  - Handle MPI datatypes using MPI2 converstion functions (some
              things are pointers by definition)
       -no_pmpi
              - Do not generate PMPI names
       -pmpi name
              - Change macro used to select MPI profiling version
       -noprofile
              - Turn off the generation of the profiling version
       -mnative
              - Multiple indirects are native datatypes (no coercion)
       -voidisptr
              - Consider "void *" as a pointer to a structure.
       -ansi  - C routines use ANSI prototype form rather than K&R C form
       -ansiheader
              - Generate ANSI-C style headers instead of Fortran interfaces
              This will be useful for creating ANSI prototypes   without ANSI-
              fying the code.  These use a trick to provide both ANSI and non-
              ANSI prototypes.  The declarations are wrapped in "ANSI_ARGS",
              the definition of which should be
              #ifdef ANSI_ARG
              #undef ANSI_ARG
              #endif
              #ifdef __STDC__
              #define ANSI_ARGS(a) a
              #else
              #define ANSI_ARGS(a) ()
              #endif

       -nodebug
              - Do not add
              #ifndef DEBUG_ALL
              #define DEBUG_ALL
              #endif

              to the wrapper file.
       -anyname
              - Generate a single wrapper that can handle the three most
              common cases: trailing underscore, no underscore, and all caps.
              The choice is based on whether
              FORTRANCAPS:       Names are uppercase, no trailing underscore
              FORTRANUNDERSCORE: Names are lowercase, trailing underscore
              are defined.
              FORTRANDOUBLEUNDERSCORE: Names are lowercase, with TWO trailing

              underscores.  This is needed when some versions of "f2c" are
              used to generate C for Fortran routines.  Note that f2c uses two
              underscores ONLY when the name already contains an underscore
              (at least on the FreeBSD system that I use that uses f2c).  To
              handle this case, the generated code contains the second
              underscore only when the name already contains one.

              If -mapptr is also chosen, then
              POINTER_64_BITS

              will also be used to determine if pointers are to long to fit in
              a 32-bit Fortran integer.  Routines that destroy a pointer will
              need to manually insert a call to __RmPointer.  The routines for
              managing the pointers are in ptrcvt.c

              In addition, if -mpi is used and -no_pmpi is not, the MPI
              profiling names are also generated, surrounded by
              MPI_BUILD_PROFILING.


NOTE
       We really need a way to specify a general type as a pointer, so that it
       will be handled as a pointer.  The -mpi option is a kludge for a
       pressing need.  Eventually should provide a "-ptr name" option and keep
       in a search space when looking for known types.
