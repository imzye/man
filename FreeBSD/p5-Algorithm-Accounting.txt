Algorithm::Accounting(3)                   User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
         Algorithm::Accounting - Generate accounting statistic for general logs

SYNOPSIS
         my $fields = [qw/id author file date/];
         my $groups = [[qw(author file)], [qw(author date)]];
         my $data = [
               [1, 'alice', '/foo.txt', '2004-05-01' ],
               [2, 'bob',   '/foo.txt', '2004-05-03' ],
               [3, 'alice', '/foo.txt', '2004-05-04' ],
               [4, 'john ', '/foo.txt', '2004-05-04' ],
               [5, 'john ', [qw(/foo.txt /bar.txt], '2004-05-04' ],
         ];


         # give the object information
         my $acc = Algorithm::Accounting->new(fields => $fields,
                                              field_groups => $groups );

         $acc->append_data($data);

         # Generate report to STDOUT
         $acc->report;

         # Get result
         my $result = $acc->result;

         # Get result of a specific field.
         my $author_accounting = $acc->result('author');

         # Reset current result so we can restart
         $acc->reset;

DESCRIPTION
       "Algorithm::Accounting" provide simple aggregation method to make log
       accounting easier. It accepts data in rows, each rows can have many
       fields, and each field is a scalar or a list(arrayref).

       The basic usage is you walk through all your logs, and use
       append_data() to insert each rows, (you'll have to split the line into
       fields), and then call result() to retrieve the result, or report() to
       immediatly see simple result.

       You may specify a filed_groups parameter (arrayref of arrayref), and
       "Algorithm::Accounting" will account these fields in groups.

       Notice you'll have to give a list fileds first, the append_data()
       depends on the number of fields to work properly.
