NAME
       yaggo - command line switch parser generator


SYNOPSIS
       yaggo [-o|--output FILE] [-l|--license PATH] [-s|--stub] [--zc PATH]
       [-e|--extended-syntax] [--man] [-h|--help]


DESCRIPTION
       Yaggo stands for Yet Another GenGetOpt. It is inspired by gengetopt
       software from the FSF.

       Yaggo generates a C++ class to parse command line switches (usually
       argc and argv passed to main) using getopt_long. The switches and
       arguments to the program are specified in a description file. To each
       description file, yaggo generates one C++ header file containing the
       parsing code.

       See the EXAMPLES section for a complete and simple example.


OPTIONS
       -l|--license
              Display the file at the top of the generated headers. It usually
              contains the license governing the distribution of the headers.

       -m|--man
              Display this man page

       -s|--stub
              Generate a stub: a simple yaggo file that can be modified for
              one's use.

       -e|--extended-syntax
              Use the extended syntax: blocks can be defined on the next line
              of a command.

       -h|--help
              Display a short help text

EXAMPLE
       Consider the description files 'example_args.yaggo' which defines a
       switch "-i" (or "--int") that takes an unsigned integer and defaults to
       42; a switch "-s" (or "--string") that takes a string and can be given
       multiple times; a switch "--flag" which does not take any argument; a
       switch "--severity" which can take only 3 values: "low", "middle" and
       "high".

       It takes the following arguments: a string followed by zero or more
       floating point numbers.

       purpose "Example of yaggo usage"
       package "example"
       description "This is just an example.
       And a multi-line description."

       option("int", "i") {
         description "Integer switch"
         uint32; default "42" }
       option("string", "s") {
         description "Many strings"
         string; multiple }
       option("flag") {
         description "A flag switch"
         flag; off }
       option("severity") {
         description "An enum switch"
         enum "low", "middle", "high" }
       arg("first") {
         description "First arg"
         c_string }
       arg("rest") {
         description "Rest of'em"
         double; multiple }

       The associated simple C++ program 'examples.cpp' which display
       information about the switches and arguments passed:

       #include <iostream>
       #include "example_args.hpp"

       int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
         example_args args(argc, argv);

         std::cout << "Integer switch: " << args.int_arg << "\n";
         if(args.string_given)
           std::cout << "Number of string(s): " << args.string_arg.size() << "\n";
         else
           std::cout << "No string switch\n";
         std::cout << "Flag is " << (args.flag_flag ? "on" : "off") << "\n";
         std::cout << "First arg: " << args.first_arg << "\n";
         std::cout << "Severity arg: " << args.severity_arg << " " << example_args::severity::strs[args.severity_arg] << "\n";
         if(args.severity_arg == example_args::severity::high)
           std::cout << "Warning: severity is high\n";
         std::cout << "Rest:";
         for(example_args::rest_arg_it it = args.rest_arg.begin(); it != args.rest_arg.end(); ++it)
           std::cout << " " << *it;
         std::cout << std::endl;

         return 0;
       }

       This can be compiled with the following commands:

       % yaggo example_args.yaggo
       % g++ -o example example.cpp

       The yaggo command above will create by default the file file name can
       be changed with the 'output' keyword explained below.


DESCRIPTION FORMAT
       A description file is a sequence of statements. A statement is a
       keyword followed by some arguments. Strings must be surrounded by
       quotes ("" or '') and can span multiple lines. The order of the
       statements is irrelevant. Statements are separated by new lines or
       semi-colons ';'.


       *      Technically speaking, yaggo is implemented as a DSL (Domain
              Specific Language) using ruby. The description file is a valid
              ruby script and the keywords are ruby functions.

       The following statements are global, not attached to a particular
       option or argument.


       purpose
              A one line description of the program.

       package
              The name of the package for the usage string. Defaults to the
              name of the class.

       usage  The usage string. If none given a standard one is generated by
              yaggo.

       description
              A longer description of the program displayed before the list of
              switch. Displayed by the help.

       text   Some text to be displayed after the list of switches. Displayed
              by the help.

       version
              The version string of the software.

       license
              The license and copyright string of the software.

       name   The name of the class generated. Defaults to the name of the
              description file minus the .yaggo extension.

       posix  Posix correct behavior (instead of GNU behavior): switch
              processing stops at the first non-option argument

       output The name of the output file. Defaults to the name of the
              description file with the .yaggo extension changed to .hpp.

       The 'option' statement takes one or two arguments, which must be in
       parentheses, and a block of statements surrounded by curly braces
       ({...}). The arguments are the long and short version of the option.
       Either one of the long or short version can be omitted. The block of
       statements describe the option in more details, as described below.

       A switch is named after the long version, or the short version if no
       long version. An 'option' statement for an option named 'switch'
       defines one or two public members in the class. For a flag, it creates
       'switch_flag' as a boolean. Otherwise, it creates 'switch_arg', with a
       type as specified, and 'switch_given', a boolean indicating whether or
       not the switch was given on the command line.

       For example, the statement:

       option("integer", "i") {
         int; default 5
       }

       will add the following members to the C++ class:

       int integer_arg;
       bool integer_given;

       where "integer_arg" is initialized to 5 and "integer_given" is
       initialized to "false". If the switch "--integer 10" or "-i 10" is
       passed on the command line "integer_arg" is set to 10 and integer_given
       is set to "true".

       The statement:

       option("verbose") {
         off
       }

       will add the following member to the C++ class:

       bool verbose_flag;

       where "verbose_flag" is initialized to "false". Passing the switch
       "--verbose" on the command line sets "verbose_flag" to true".


       In addition to the switch created by 'option', the following switches
       are defined by default (unless some option statement overrides them):


       -h, --help
              Display the help message.

       --full-help
              Display hidden options as well.

       --version
              Display version string.

       The following statement are recognized in an option block:


       description "str"
              A short description for this switch.


       int32, int64, uint32, uint64, double, int, long
              This switch is parsed as a number with the corresponding type
              int32_t, int64_t, uint32_t, uint64_t, double, int and long.


       suffix Valid for numerical type switches as above. It can be appended
              with a SI suffix (e.g. 1M mean 1000000). The suffixes k, M, G,
              T, P, and E are supported for all the numerical types. The
              suffixes m, u, n, p, f, and a are supported for the double type.


       c_string, string
              This switch is taken as a C string (const char *) or a C++
              string (inherits from std::string). The C++ string type has the
              extra methods '<type> as_<type>(bool suffix)', where <type> is
              any numerical type as above, to convert the string into that
              type. If the 'suffix' boolean is true, parsing is done using SI
              suffixes.


       enum   This statement must be followed by a comma separated list of
              strings (as in 'enum "choice0", "choice1", "choice2"'). This
              switch takes value a string in the list and is converted to int.
              C enum type named "switchname::enum" is defined with the same
              choices in the given order.


       required
              This switch is required. An error is generated if not given on
              the command line.

       conflict
              Specify a comma separated list of switches that conflicts with
              this one.

       imply  Specify a comma separated list of switches (of type flag) which
              are implied by this one.

       hidden This switch is not shown with --help. Use --full-help to see the
              hidden switches, if any.

       secret This switch is not shown in any help message. Neither --help nor
              --full-help.

       multiple
              This switch can be passed multiple times. The values are stored
              in a std::vector. A type for the iterator is also defined in the
              class with the name 'switch_arg_it', where 'switch' is the name
              of the option.

       flag   This switch is a flag and does not take an argument.

       on, off
              The default state for a flag switch. Implies flag. Unless the
              'no' option is used (see below), with 'off', the default value
              of the flag is "false" and passing --flag sets it to true. With
              'on', the default value of the flag is "true" and passing --flag
              sets it to false.

       no     A flag with two switches. If the switch is named "flag", two
              switches are generated: --flag and --noflag, respectively
              setting it to "true" and "false". The 'on' and 'off' options
              define the default value.

       default "val"
              The default value for this switch. It can be a string or a valid
              number. SI suffixes are supported as well (for example "1M"
              means 1 m`illion).

       typestr "str"
              In the help message, by default, the type of the option is
              displayed. It can be replaced by the string given to 'typestr'.

       at_least n
              The given switch must be given at least n times. Implies
              multiple.

       access "type"
              Make sure that the string passed is a path to which we have
              access. "type" is a comma separated list of "read", "write" or
              "exec". It is checked with access(2). The same warning applies:

              "Warning: Using access() to check if a user is authorized to,
              for example, open a file before actually doing so using open(2)
              creates a security hole, because the user might exploit the
              short time interval between checking and opening the file to
              manipulate it.  For this reason, the use of this system call
              should be avoided.  (In the example just described, a safer
              alternative would be to temporarily switch the process's
              effective user ID to the real ID and then call open(2).)"


       A 'arg' statement defines an arg passed to the command line. The
       statement takes a single argument, the name of the arg, and a block of
       statements. The block of statements are similar to the option block,
       except that "hidden", "flag", "on", "off" and "no" are not allowed. At
       most one arg can have the 'multiple' statement, and it must be the last
       one.


EXAMPLE USAGE
       The argument object parses the switches on construction or later on
       using the parse method. For example, the two pieces code show these two
       different usage.

       Using parse method:
         example_args args; // Global variable with switches

         int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
           args.parse(argc, argv);
         }

       Parse on construction:
         int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
           example_args args(argc, argv);
         }

       The subclass error can be used to output error messsage (and terminate
       program). It output an error message, the usage string, etc. The error
       class behave like an output stream, it can be used to create
       complicated error message. For example:

         if(false_condition)
           example_args::error() << "Failed to open file '" << args.file_arg << "'";

       An error object prints an error message and terminate the program with
       exit upon destruction. An exit code can be passed to error. By default
       the exit code (passed to exit) is the constant EXIT_FAILURE (normally
       1). For example:

         example_args::error(77) << "Failed with return code 77";
