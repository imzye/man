NAME
       String::TtyLength - length or width of string excluding ANSI tty codes

SYNOPSIS
        use String::TtyLength 0.02 qw/ tty_length tty_width /;
        $length = tty_length("\e[1mbold text\e[0m");
        print "length = $length\n";
        # 9

        $width = tty_width("😄");
        print "width = $width\n";
        # 2

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides two functions which tell you the length and width
       of a string as it will appear on a terminal (tty), excluding any ANSI
       escape codes.

       "tty_length" returns the length of a string excluding any ANSI tty /
       terminal escape codes.

       "tty_width" returns the number of columns on a terminal that the string
       will take up, also excluding any escape codes.

       For non-wide characters, the functions will return the same value.  But
       consider the following:

        my $emoji  = "😄";
        my $length = tty_length($emoji);   # 1
        my $width  = tty_width($emoji);    # 2

       If you're trying to align text in columns, then you'll probably want
       "tty_width"; if you just want to know the number of characters, using
       "tty_length".

   tty_length( STRING )
       Takes a single string, and returns the length of the string, excluding
       any escape sequences.

       Note: the escape sequences could include cursor movement, so the length
       returned by this function might not be the number of characters that
       would be visible on screen.  But
       length_of_string_excluding_escape_sequences() was just too long.

   tty_width( STRING )
       Takes a single string and returns the number of columns that the string
       will take up on a terminal.

       You may find that sometimes tty_width() returns the wrong number.  If
       you do, please submit a bug, or email me at the address below.

       This was added in version 0.02 of "String::TtyLength", so you should
       require at least that version of this module, as per the SYNOPSIS.

SEE ALSO
       colorstrip() in Term::ANSIColor will remove ANSI color escape sequences
       from a string, but not all ANSI escape sequences.
