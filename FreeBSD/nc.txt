NAME
       ncat - network aware cat

SYNOPSIS
       ncat -V | -h
       ncat [ -c | -n | -v | -o stream | -b size ]...  stream...

DESCRIPTION
       ncat concatenates data streams similar to cat(1) except the streams can
       be files or TCP connections. If no streams are given on the command
       line ncat will default to reading from standard input and writing to
       standard output.

       There are several different forms for specifying a stream:

       filename or filename:
              Any filename containing a colon needs to be escaped by adding a
              colon on the end, otherwise it will be interpreted as a tcp
              stream. A special filename "-" can be used to specify standard
              input or output.

       host:port
              Connect to host/port.  This will fail if the remote side is not
              ready for the connection.

       :port  Wait for a connection on port.  This can block indefinitely. If
              port is 0 (or omitted) ncat will bind to a free port and display
              the port used on standard error.

OPTIONS
   -o, --output
       Output to stream instead of standard output.

   -b, --block-size
       Use a different block size for reading and writing. The default is 512
       bytes.  size can be given a suffix to denote a multiplier: b for 512 ,
       k for 1024, m for 1024k.

   -v, --verbose
       Show data transfer statistics.

   -n, --no-delay
       Disable buffering and merging small tcp packets. This can reduce
       latency in some situations.

   -c, --cork
       Prevent TCP from sending partial packets across the network until the
       connections is closed. This breaks compatibility with cat by not
       passing data on immediately, but it may improve performance depending
       on your requirements. Linux 2.2+ is required to use this option.

   -V, --version
       Display version and exit.

   -h, --help
       Display usage information and exit.

EXIT STATUS
       0      Success

       1      One or more errors occured reading data and ncat continued onto
              the next stream.

       255    A fatal error occured writing data.

BUGS
       Some rarely used options found in cat(1) are missing from ncat.  These
       options can be recreated easily by using another filter such as
       perl(1), awk(1), sed(1), or tr(1).
