ISL(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 ISL(4)

NAME
     isl – Intersil(TM) I2C ISL29018 sensor driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines into
     the kernel configuration file:

           device isl
           device ig4
           device iicbus

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           isl_load="YES"
           ig4_load="YES"

     On many Chromebook models this driver can be automatically configured
     with the help of the chromebook_platform(4) driver.  Alternatively, the
     isl driver can be manually configured in /boot/device.hints:
         hint.isl.0.at="iicbus0"
         hint.isl.0.addr="0x88"
         hint.isl.1.at="iicbus1"
         hint.isl.1.addr="0x88"

DESCRIPTION
     The isl driver provides access to sensor data provided by the
     Intersil(TM) I2C ISL29018 Digital Ambient Light Sensor and Proximity
     Sensor with Interrupt Function.  Functionality is basic and provided
     through the sysctl(8) interface.

     On a system using device.hints(5), these values are configurable for isl:

     hint.isl.%d.at    target iicbus(4).

     hint.isl.%d.addr  isl i2c address on the iicbus(4).

SYSCTL VARIABLES
     The following sysctl(8) variables are available:

     dev.isl.X.als         Current ALS (Ambient Light Sensor) readout.

     dev.isl.X.ir          Current IR (InfraRed) sensor readout.

     dev.isl.X.prox        Current proximity sensor readout.

     dev.isl.X.resolution  Current sensor resolution.

     dev.isl.X.range       Current sensor range.

EXAMPLES
   Ambient light sensor read out
     $ sysctl dev.isl.0.als
     dev.isl.0.als: 64

   Automatically adjust brightness
     This requires the port graphics/intel-backlight and only works with
     laptops using a supported Intel(R) GPU.

     $ pkg install intel-backlight
     $ sh /usr/local/share/examples/intel-backlight/isl_backlight.sh

BUGS
     The isl driver detects the device based from the I2C address.  This might
     have unforeseen consequences if the initialization sequence is sent to an
     unknown device at that address.
