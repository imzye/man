SYNOPSIS
       qiv [options] file ...

DESCRIPTION
       qiv is an image viewer developed with gdk3/gdk2. As a result, qiv is
       faster than traditional image viewers such as xv or xli.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Print out a brief help message.

       --display disp
              Open qiv window on display disp.

       -F, --file file | stdin
              Read file names from file or stdin, one name per line. This
              option can be specified multiple times to read from several
              files, and will not affect other file names passed on the
              command line.

       -u, --recursivedir
              Change the behavior of qiv to recursively descend into the
              directories given on the command line.

       -L, --followlinks
              With --recursivedir, this allows a symlink to point to a
              directory.  This is useful for organizing photo dirs into
              categories, but it is up to you to ensure that there are no
              symlink loops that would cause an infinite scan.

       -e, --center
              Disable window centering.

       -w, --fixed_width x
              Window with fixed width x.

       -W, --fixed_zoom x.
              Window with fixed zoom factor (percentage x).

       --highDPIfactor FLOAT
              Resize everything by this factor to compensate for high (or also
              low) DPI screens.

       -x, --root file
              Set file as the current desktop background (centered) and exit.

       -y, --root_t file
              Set file as the current desktop background (tiled) and exit.

       -z, --root_s file
              Set file as the current desktop background (stretched) and exit.

       -m, --maxpect
              Expand image(s) to fit screen size while preserving aspect
              ratio.

       -t, --scale_down
              Shrink image(s) which are larger than screen size to fit.

       -b, --brightness x
              Set brightness to x (-32..32).

       -c, --contrast x
              Set contrast to x (-32..32).

       -g, --gamma x
              Set gamma to x (-32..32).

       -n, --no_filter
              Disable filtering of images by extension. Normally, qiv will
              only load images with an image extension such as .jpg, .png,
              .gif ...  This option lets you load any file as an image.

       -i, --no_statusbar
              Disable statusbar.

       -I, --statusbar
              Enable statusbar.

       -J, --showJPEGcomments
              Enable display of JPEG comments.

       -E, --showArtistName
              Enable display of artist (author) name (in JPEG images).

       --artist_ignore STRING
              Do NOT show artist name if it is equal to this string

       -p, --transparency
              Enable transparency for transparent images.

       -a, --do_grab
              Grab the pointer in windowed mode.

       -G, --disable_grab
              Disable grabbing the pointer/kbd in fullscreen mode. Useful e.g.
              if qiv displays images on a display other than where it was
              invoked from. Use with caution!

       -v, --version
              Print version information.

       -o, --bg_color x
              Set root background color to named color x or 24 bit hex RGB
              triple in the format #RRGGBB.

       -C, --cycle
              Change cycle behaviour. qiv will exit after last picture has
              been shown.

       -s, --slide
              Start slideshow immediately. This can also be used for the
              desktop background (x/y/z).

       -r, --random
              Randomize slideshow.

       -R, --readonly
              Disable the deletion feature.

       -S, --shuffle
              Shuffle images (random order with next/previous functionality).

       -d, --delay x
              Set slideshow delay to x seconds.

       -f, --fullscreen
              Use fullscreen window on start-up.

       -P, --ignore_path_sort
              Sort all the image files by just their filename, ignoring the
              path.

       -M, --merged_case_sort
              Sort all the image files in merged-case order (AaBbCc...).

       -K, --mtime_sort
              Sort files by their modification time

       -N, --numeric_sort
              A "smart" numeric sort that attempts to sort filenames with
              numbers in a logical manner.  For instance: 2.jpg sorts before
              10.jpg; 1foo.jpg through 10foo.jpg sorts after 1bar.jpg through
              15bar.jpg (because "foo" comes after "bar"); and baz0001.jpg
              through baz0010.jpg sorts after baz01.jpg through baz99.jpg
              (because the longer group of zero-padded digits indicates that
              they shouldn't be intermingled).

       -D, --no_sort
              Do not apply any sorting to the list of files.

       -T, --watch
              Reload the image if it has changed on disk.

       -A, --select_dir dir
              Store the selected files in dir (default is .qiv-select).

       -q, --rotate x
              Rotate each image 90(x=1),180(x=2),270(x=3) degrees clockwise.
              If x=11 or x=13, the 90 or 270 degree rotation is conditional on
              the image fitting better if rotated.  e.g. if the display is
              wide and a tall image is too tall to fit on the screen, it will
              be rotated.

       -l, --autorotate
              Do NOT autorotate JPEGs according to EXIF rotation tag.  Default
              is ON.

       -X, --xineramascreen x
              Use monitor x as preferred screen

       -Y, --source_profile x
              Use color profile file x as source profile for all images

       -Z, --display_profile x
              Use color profile file x as display profile for all images

       -B, --browse
              This option is useful when configuring qiv to be used with a
              file manager.  qiv will scan the directory of the clicked image
              and allow you to scroll through those images.

       --trashbin
              Use users trash bin instead of .qiv-trash. Undeleting an image
              will not work, open the trash bin and restore the image instead.

       --vikeys
              Enable movement with h/j/k/l, vi-style (HJKL will do what hjkl
              previously did)

       Extra mouse buttons (8,9)           zoom out/in (10%)

DELETING
       qiv doesn't actually delete files. It creates a directory named ".qiv-
       trash" and moves the images to that directory. qiv maintains the
       directory structure of your "deleted" images. You can also undelete the
       most recently trashed images in reverse order, which moves each file
       back into its original directory. There is a limit to how many
       deletions can be undone, but it should be pretty large (currently 1024
       items).  Sometimes this feature might be unwanted. To prevent accidents
       you can specify the "-R" option to disable this feature. If the
       "--trashbin" option is used qiv will move the deleted pictures to the
       users trash bin. In that case undeleting with pressing "u" will not
       work. Open the trash bin and restore the image instead.

IMWHEEL SUPPORT
       With XFree86 3.3.2+ server, using the wheel is seen as button 4 and 5
       pressed. You only have to use "IMPS/2" or "Intellimouse" for protocol
       and add "ZAxisMapping    4 5 " in the "Pointer" section of XF86Config.
       If imwheel (a program used to emulate key pressed when wheel is used
       for program not supporting wheel), the following two lines must be add
       to imwheel config file :

       "qiv"
       @Exclude

USER-DEFINED KEYBOARD ACTIONS
       Keys 0-9 will invoke qiv-command with the key pressed as the first
       argument and the current image filename as the second argument.
       qiv-command is not distributed with qiv; it is to be supplied by the
       user.  Thus, this feature could be enabled by placing a simple shell
       script such as the following in the command search path (for example,
       in the user's ~/bin directory):

       #!/bin/sh
       # Argument sanity checking eliminated for brevity
       case $1 in
         0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9) mkdir -f dir$1; mv "$fname" dir$1 ;;
         *) echo "unrecognized command"; exit ;;
       esac

       If the first line of the output is like "NEWNAME=xxxxxxx" then qiv
       thinks that the filename of the currently displayed image has changed
       to this new name and updates its internal filelist.  This is very
       useful when using qiv-command to rename files.

       Please also see the example that came together with qiv.
