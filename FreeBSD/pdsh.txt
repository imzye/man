DSHBAK(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              DSHBAK(1)

NAME
       dshbak - format output from pdsh command


SYNOPSIS
       dshbak [OPTION]..


DESCRIPTION
       The dshbak program formats pdsh pdsh output for humans.  Output from
       each node is consolidated, the leading "node:" is stripped, and a
       header block with the node name is added. If the -c option is
       specified, nodes with identical output are not displayed twice;
       instead, the header will contain a list of nodes. The list of nodes is
       further compressed into node ranges if the node names have a numeric
       suffix.


OPTIONS
       -h     Display a summary of command line options.

       -c     Do not display identical output from nodes twice. Instead, print
              the list of nodes with matching output in the header block.

       -d DIR Write consolidated node output to separate files in output
              directory DIR. Any existing files will be overwritten.

       -f     With -d, force creation of specified DIR.
