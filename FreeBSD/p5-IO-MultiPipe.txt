NAME
       IO::MultiPipe - Allows for error checking on a command involving
       multiple pipes.

VERSION
       Version 0.0.0

SYNOPSIS
       Normally if a part of a pipe fails, depending on the location, it won't
       be detected. This breaks down a command involving pipes and runs each
       command seperately.

       It uses open3 to run each chunk of the pipe.

           use IO::MultiPipe;

           my $pipes = IO::MultiPipe->new();

           #This sets the pipe that will be run.
           $pipes->set('sed s/-// | sed s/123/abc/ | sed s/ABC/abc/');
           if ($pipes->{error}){
               print "Error!\n";
           }

           #'123-ABCxyz' through the command set above.
           my $returned=$pipes->run('123-ABCxyz');

FUNCTIONS
   new
       Initializes the object.

   run
       This runs the data through the pipe.

   set
       Sets the command that will be used.

           $pipes->set('sed s/-// | sed s/123/abc/ | sed s/ABC/abc/');
           if ($pipes->{error}){
               print "Error!\n";
           }

   errorBlank
       This blanks the error storage and is only meant for internal usage.

       It does the following.

           $self->{error}=undef;
           $self->{errorString}="";

ERROR CODES
       This is contained in '$pipe->{error}'. Any time this is true, there is
       an error.

   1
       No command passed to the set function.

   2
       Command contains null section.

   3
       No command has been set yet. The 'set' needs called first before
       calling 'run'.

   4
       Opening the command failed.

   5
       The command errored.
