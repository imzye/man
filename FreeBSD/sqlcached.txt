NAME
       sqlcached - A high-performance cache daemon

SYNOPSIS
       sqlcached is a unix daemon process intended to be used much like
       memcached, but offering much higher flexibility through use of SQL for
       data manipulation and query. In essence, you may look at sqlcached as a
       memory-based SQL database..sp This documentation is yet to be
       completed..sp
