NAME
       Crypt::Loki97 - Crypt::CBC compliant block cipher

SYNOPSIS
           use Crypt::Loki97;

           $cipher = new Crypt::Loki97 $key;
           $ciphertext = $cipher->encrypt($plaintext);
           $plaintext  = $cipher->decrypt($ciphertext);

DESCRIPTION
       Loki97 is 128-bit block cipher that accepts a variable-length key. It
       was designed by Lawrie Brown, Josef Pieprzyk, and Jennifer Seberry.

       The default key length in this implementation is 128 bits.

       Loki97 was one of the 15 candidates for the AES.

       This module supports the Crypt::CBC interface, with the following
       functions.

   Functions
       blocksize
           Returns the size (in bytes) of the block (16, in this case).

       keysize
           Returns the size (in bytes) of the key (16, in this case).

       encrypt($data)
           Encrypts 16 bytes of $data and returns the corresponding
           ciphertext.

       decrypt($data)
           Decrypts 16 bytes of $data and returns the corresponding plaintext.

EXAMPLE 1
           #!/usr/local/bin/perl

           use diagnostics;
           use strict;
           use warnings;
           use Crypt::Loki97;

           # key must be 16 bytes long
           my $key = "0123456789abcdef";

           my $cipher = new Crypt::Loki97 $key;

           print "blocksize = ", $cipher->blocksize, " bytes \n";
           print "keysize = ", $cipher->keysize, " bytes \n";

           # block must be 16 bytes long
           my $plaintext1 = "0123456789abcdef";

           my $ciphertext = $cipher->encrypt($plaintext1);
           my $plaintext2 = $cipher->decrypt($ciphertext);

           print "Decryption OK\n" if ($plaintext1 eq $plaintext2);

EXAMPLE 2
           #!/usr/local/bin/perl

           use diagnostics;
           use strict;
           use warnings;
           use Crypt::CBC;  # CBC automatically loads Loki97 for us

           # when using Crypt::CBC, key may be of ANY length
           my $key = "0123456789abcdef";

           # IV must be exactly 16 bytes long
           my $IV = pack "H32", 0;

           my $cipher = Crypt::CBC->new({'key' => $key,
                                         'cipher' => 'Loki97',
                                         'iv' => $IV,
                                         'regenerate_key' => 1,
                                         'padding' => 'standard',
                                         'prepend_iv' => 0
                                       });

           # when using Crypt::CBC, plaintext may be of ANY length
           my $plaintext1 = "This is a test";

           my $ciphertext = $cipher->encrypt($plaintext1);
           my $plaintext2 = $cipher->decrypt($ciphertext);

           print "Decryption OK\n" if ($plaintext1 eq $plaintext2);
