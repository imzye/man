NFSIOD(8)               FreeBSD System Manager's Manual              NFSIOD(8)

NAME
     nfsiod – local NFS asynchronous I/O server

SYNOPSIS
     nfsiod [-n num_servers]

DESCRIPTION
     The nfsiod utility controls the maximum number of nfsiod kernel processes
     which run on an NFS client machine to service asynchronous I/O requests
     to its server.  Having nfsiod kernel processes improves performance but
     is not required for correct operation.

     The option is as follows:

     -n      Specify how many processes are permitted to be started.

     Without an option, nfsiod displays the current settings.  A client should
     allow enough number of processes to handle its maximum level of
     concurrency, typically four to six.

     If nfsiod detects that the running kernel does not include NFS support,
     it will attempt to load a kernel module containing NFS code, using
     kldload(2).  If this fails, or no NFS module was available, nfsiod exits
     with an error.

EXIT STATUS
     The nfsiod utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

SEE ALSO
     nfsstat(1), kldload(2), nfssvc(2), mountd(8), nfsd(8), rpcbind(8)

HISTORY
     The nfsiod utility first appeared in 4.4BSD.

     Starting with FreeBSD 5.0, the utility no longer starts daemons, but only
     serves as a vfs loader and sysctl(3) wrapper.
