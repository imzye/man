NAME
       goose - Search Google using the command line.

SYNOPSIS
       goose [one or more search terms]

OPTIONS
               The only command line parameters are the search terms to pass
               to Google.  Keep in mind that the usual shell escaping rules
               need to be observed.

FILES
       Goose uses configuration files to store the Google web API key. They
       both observe the same format. An example is provided in
       /usr/local/share/examples/goose/goose.conf.example.

       /usr/local/etc/goose.conf
               The system-wide configuration file.

       $(HOME)/.goose.conf
               The user-specific configuration file. The values in this file
               override the values in the system-wide configuration file.
