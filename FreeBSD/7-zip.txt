Listfile
       You can supply one or more filenames or wildcards for special list
       files (files containing lists of files). The filenames in such list
       file must be separated by new line symbol(s). For list files, 7-Zip
       uses UTF-8 encoding by default. You can change encoding using -scs
       switch. Multiple list files are supported.

       For example, if the file "listfile.txt" contains the following:

              My programs\*.cpp
              Src\*.cpp

       then the command

              7z a -tzip archive.zip @listfile.txt

       adds to the archive "archive.zip" all "*.cpp" files from directories
       "My programs" and "Src".
