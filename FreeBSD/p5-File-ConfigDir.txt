NAME
       File::ConfigDir - Get directories of configuration files

SYNOPSIS
           use File::ConfigDir ':ALL';

           my @cfgdirs = config_dirs();
           my @appcfgdirs = config_dirs('app');

           # install support
           my $site_cfg_dir = (site_cfg_dir())[0];
           my $vendor_cfg_dir = (site_cfg_dir()))[0];

DESCRIPTION
       This module is a helper for installing, reading and finding
       configuration file locations. It's intended to work in every supported
       Perl5 environment and will always try to Do The Right Thing(TM).

       "File::ConfigDir" is a module to help out when perl modules (especially
       applications) need to read and store configuration files from more than
       one location. Writing user configuration is easy thanks to
       File::HomeDir, but what when the system administrator needs to place
       some global configuration or there will be system related configuration
       (in "/etc" on UNIX(TM) or $ENV{windir} on Windows(TM)) and some network
       configuration in NFS mapped "/etc/p5-app" or "$ENV{ALLUSERSPROFILE} .
       "\\Application Data\\p5-app"", respectively.

       "File::ConfigDir" has no "do what I mean" mode - it's entirely up to
       the user to pick the right directory for each particular application.

EXPORT
       Every function listed below can be exported, either by name or using
       the tag ":ALL".

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
       All functions can take one optional argument as application specific
       configuration directory. If given, it will be embedded at the right
       (TM) place of the resulting path.

   system_cfg_dir
       Returns the configuration directory where configuration files of the
       operating system resides. For Unices this is "/etc", for MSWin32 it's
       the value of the environment variable "%windir%".

   machine_cfg_dir
       Alias for desktop_cfg_dir - deprecated.

   xdg_config_dirs
       Alias for desktop_cfg_dir

   desktop_cfg_dir
       Returns the configuration directory where configuration files of the
       desktop applications resides. For Unices this is "/etc/xdg", for
       MSWin32 it's the value of the environment variable "%ALLUSERSPROFILE%"
       concatenated with the basename of the environment variable "%APPDATA%".

   core_cfg_dir
       Returns the "etc" directory below $Config{prefix}.

   site_cfg_dir
       Returns the "etc" directory below $Config{sitelib_stem} or the common
       base directory of $Config{sitelib} and $Config{sitebin}.

   vendor_cfg_dir
       Returns the "etc" directory below $Config{vendorlib_stem} or the common
       base directory of $Config{vendorlib} and $Config{vendorbin}.

   singleapp_cfg_dir
       Returns the configuration file for stand-alone installed applications.
       In Unix speak, installing JRE to "/usr/local/jre-<version>" means there
       is a "/usr/local/jre-<version>/bin/java" and going from it's directory
       name one above and into "etc" there is the singleapp_cfg_dir. For a
       Perl module it means, we're assuming that $FindBin::Bin is installed as
       a stand-alone package somewhere, e.g. into "/usr/pkg" - as recommended
       for pkgsrc <http://www.pkgsrc.org/>.

   vendorapp_cfg_dir
       Returns the configuration file for vendor installed applications. In
       Unix speak, installing bacula to "/opt/${vendor}" means there is a
       "/opt/${vendor}/bin/bacula" and going from it's directory name one
       above and into "etc" there is the vendorapp_cfg_dir. For a Perl module
       it means, we're assuming that $FindBin::Bin is installed as a stand-
       alone package somewhere, e.g. into "/usr/pkg" - as recommended for
       pkgsrc <http://www.pkgsrc.org/>.

   local_cfg_dir
       Returns the configuration directory for distribution independent, 3rd
       party applications. While this directory doesn't exists for MSWin32,
       there will be only the path "/usr/local/etc" for Unices.

   locallib_cfg_dir
       Extracts the "INSTALL_BASE" from $ENV{PERL_MM_OPT} and returns the
       "etc" directory below it.

   here_cfg_dir
       Returns the path for the "etc" directory below the current working
       directory.

   user_cfg_dir
       Returns the users home folder using File::HomeDir. Without
       File::HomeDir, nothing is returned.

   xdg_config_home
       Returns the user configuration directory for desktop applications.  If
       $ENV{XDG_CONFIG_HOME} is not set, for MSWin32 the value of
       $ENV{APPDATA} is return and on Unices the ".config" directory in the
       users home folder. Without File::HomeDir, on Unices the returned list
       might be empty.

   config_dirs
           @cfgdirs = config_dirs();
           @cfgdirs = config_dirs( 'appname' );

       Tries to get all available configuration directories as described
       above.  Returns those who exists and are readable.

   _plug_dir_source
           my $dir_src = sub { return _better_config_dir(@_); }
           File::ConfigDir::_plug_dir_source($dir_src);

           my $pure_src = sub { return _better_config_plain_dir(@_); }
           File::ConfigDir::_plug_dir_source($pure_src, 1); # see 2nd arg is true

       Registers more sources to ask for suitable directories to check or
       search for config files. Each "config_dirs" will traverse them in
       subsequent invocations, too.

       Returns the number of directory sources in case of success. Returns
       nothing when $dir_src is not a code ref.
