NAME
       Test::Timer - test module to test/assert response times

VERSION
       The documentation describes version 2.12 of Test::Timer

FEATURES
       •   Test subroutines to implement unit-tests to time that your code
           executes before a specified threshold

       •   Test subroutines to implement unit-tests to time that your code
           execution exceeds a specified threshold

       •   Test subroutine to implement unit-tests to time that your code
           executes within a specified time frame

       •   Supports measurements in seconds

       •   Implements configurable alarm signal handler to make sure that your
           tests do not execute forever

SYNOPSIS
           use Test::Timer;

           time_ok( sub { doYourStuffButBeQuickAboutIt(); }, 1, 'threshold of one second');

           time_atmost( sub { doYourStuffYouHave10Seconds(); }, 10, 'threshold of 10 seconds');

           time_between( sub { doYourStuffYouHave5-10Seconds(); }, 5, 10,
               'lower threshold of 5 seconds and upper threshold of 10 seconds');

           # Will succeed
           time_nok( sub { sleep(2); }, 1, 'threshold of one second');

           time_atleast( sub { sleep(2); }, 2, 'threshold of one second');

           # Will fail after 5 (threshold) + 2 seconds (default alarm)
           time_ok( sub { while(1) { sleep(1); } }, 5, 'threshold of one second');

           $test::Timer::alarm = 6 #default 2 seconds

           # Will fail after 5 (threshold) + 6 seconds (specified alarm)
           time_ok( sub { while(1) { sleep(1); } }, 5, 'threshold of one second');

DESCRIPTION
       Test::Timer implements a set of test primitives to test and assert test
       times from bodies of code.

       The key features are subroutines to assert or test the following:

       •   that a given piece of code does not exceed a specified time limit

       •   that a given piece of code takes longer than a specified time limit
           and does not exceed another

EXPORT
       Test::Timer exports:

       •   time_ok

       •   time_nok

       •   time_atleast

       •   time_atmost

       •   time_between

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
   time_ok
       Takes the following parameters:

       •   a reference to a block of code (anonymous sub)

       •   a threshold specified as a integer indicating a number of seconds

       •   a string specifying a test name

           time_nok( sub { sleep(2); }, 1, 'threshold of one second');

       If the execution of the code exceeds the threshold specified the test
       fail with the following diagnostic message

           Test ran 2 seconds and exceeded specified threshold of 1 seconds

   time_nok
       The is the inverted variant of time_ok, it passes if the threshold is
       exceeded and fails if the benchmark of the code is within the specified
       timing threshold.

       The API is the same as for time_ok.

           time_nok( sub { sleep(1); }, 2, 'threshold of two seconds');

       If the execution of the code executes below the threshold specified the
       test fail with the following diagnostic message

           Test ran 1 seconds and did not exceed specified threshold of 2 seconds

   time_atmost
       This is syntactic sugar for time_ok

           time_atmost( sub { doYourStuffButBeQuickAboutIt(); }, 1, 'threshold of one second');

       If the execution of the code exceeds the threshold specified the test
       fail with the following diagnostic message

           Test ran N seconds and exceeded specified threshold of 1 seconds

       N will be the actual measured execution time of the specified code

   time_atleast
           time_atleast( sub { doYourStuffAndTakeYourTimeAboutIt(); }, 1, 'threshold of 1 second');

       The test succeeds if the code takes at least the number of seconds
       specified by the timing threshold.

       If the code executes faster, the test fails with the following
       diagnostic message

           Test ran 1 seconds and did not exceed specified threshold of 2 seconds

       Please be aware that Test::Timer, breaks the execution with an alarm
       specified to trigger after the specified threshold + 2 seconds
       (default), so if you expect your execution to run longer, set the alarm
       accordingly.

           $Test::Timer::alarm = $my_alarm_in_seconds;

       See also diagnostics.

   time_between
       This method is a more extensive variant of time_atmost and time_ok, you
       can specify a lower and upper threshold, the code has to execute within
       this interval in order for the test to succeed

           time_between( sub { sleep(2); }, 5, 10,
               'lower threshold of 5 seconds and upper threshold of 10 seconds');

       If the code executes faster than the lower threshold or exceeds the
       upper threshold, the test fails with the following diagnostic message

           Test ran 2 seconds and did not execute within specified interval 5 - 10 seconds

       Or

           Test ran 12 seconds and did not execute within specified interval 5 - 10 seconds

PRIVATE FUNCTIONS
   _runtest
       This is a method to handle the result from _benchmark is initiates the
       benchmark calling benchmark and based on whether it is within the
       provided interval true (1) is returned and if not false (0).

   _benchmark
       This is the method doing the actual benchmark, if a better method is
       located this is the place to do the handy work.

       Currently Benchmark is used. An alternative could be Devel::Timer, but
       I do not know this module very well and Benchmark is core, so this is
       used for now.

       The method takes two parameters:

       •   a code block via a code reference

       •   a threshold (the upper threshold, since this is added to the
           default alarm

   import
       Test::Builder required import to do some import hokus-pokus for the
       test methods exported from Test::Timer. Please refer to the
       documentation in Test::Builder

DIAGNOSTICS
       All tests either fail or succeed, but a few exceptions are implemented,
       these are listed below.

       •   Test did not exceed specified threshold, this message is diagnosis
           for time_atleast and time_nok tests, which do not exceed their
           specified threshold

       •   Test exceeded specified threshold, this message is a diagnostic for
           time_atmost and time_ok, if the specified threshold is surpassed.

           This is the key point of the module, either your code is too slow
           and you should address this or your threshold is too low, in which
           case you can set it a bit higher and run the test again.

       •   Test did not execute within specified interval, this is the
           diagnostic from time_between, it is the diagnosis if the execution
           of the code is not between the specified lower and upper thresholds

       •   Insufficient parameters, this is the message if a specified test is
           not provided with the sufficient number of parameters, consult this
           documentation and correct accordingly

       •   Execution exceeded threshold and timed out, the exception is thrown
           if the execution of tested code exceeds even the alarm, which is
           default 2 seconds, but can be set by the user or is equal to the
           upper threshold + 2 seconds

           The exception results in a diagnostic for the failing test. This is
           a fail-safe to avoid that code runs forever. If you get this
           diagnose either your code is too slow and you should address this
           or it might be error prone. If this is not the case adjust the
           alarm setting to suit your situation.

       This module requires no special configuration or environment.

INCOMPATIBILITIES
       This module holds no known incompatibilities.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       This module holds no known bugs.

       The current implementations only use seconds and resolutions should be
       higher, so the current implementation is limited to seconds as the
       highest resolution.

       On occasion failing tests with CPAN-testers have been observed. This
       seem to be related to the test-suite being not taking into account that
       some smoke-testers do not prioritize resources for the test run and
       that additional processes/jobs are running. The test-suite have been
       adjusted to accommodate this but these issues might reoccur.
