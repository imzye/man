NAME
       Crypt::XTEA - Implementation of the eXtended Tiny Encryption Algorithm

VERSION
       version 0.0108

SYNOPSIS
          use Crypt::XTEA;
          use Crypt::CBC;

          my $xtea = Crypt::XTEA->new( $key );
          my $cbc = Crypt::CBC->new( -cipher => $xtea );

          my $text = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.';
          my $cipher_text = $cbc->encrypt( $text );

          my $plain_text = $cbc->decrypt( $cipher_text );

DESCRIPTION
       In cryptography, XTEA (eXtended TEA) is a block cipher designed to
       correct weaknesses in TEA.  The cipher's designers were David Wheeler
       and Roger Needham of the Cambridge Computer Laboratory, and the
       algorithm was presented in an unpublished technical report in 1997
       (Needham and Wheeler, 1997).  It is not subject to any patents.

       Like TEA, XTEA is a 64-bit block Feistel cipher with a 128-bit key and
       a suggested 64 Feistel rounds (i.e 32 cycles).  Crypt::XTEA uses the
       recommended value of 32 cycles by default.

       This module implements XTEA encryption. It supports the Crypt::CBC
       interface, with the following functions.

METHODS
   keysize
       Returns the maximum XTEA key size, 16 bytes.

   blocksize
       Returns the XTEA block size, which is 8 bytes. This function exists so
       that Crypt::XTEA can work with Crypt::CBC.

   new
           my $xtea = Crypt::XTEA->new( $key, $rounds, little_endian => 0 );

       This creates a new Crypt::XTEA object with the specified key.  The
       optional rounds parameter specifies the number of rounds of encryption
       to perform, and defaults to 32.  If the key is provided as a scalar
       string, it is split to a series of 4x big-endian 32-bit integers. If
       little-endian order is required instead, the optional little_endian key
       can be set to 1. This will also cause all blocks to be interpreted as
       2x little-endian 32-bit integers.

   encrypt
           $cipher_text = $xtea->encrypt($plain_text);

       Encrypts blocksize() bytes of $plain_text and returns the corresponding
       ciphertext.

   decrypt
           $plain_text = $xtea->decrypt($cipher_text);

       Decrypts blocksize() bytes of $cipher_text and returns the
       corresponding plaintext.
