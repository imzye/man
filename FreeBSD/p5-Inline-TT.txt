NAME
       Inline::TT - Provides inline support for template toolkit 2.x

ABSTRACT
       Inline::TT provides Inline support for Template Toolkit versions 2.x.

SYNOPSIS
           use Inline TT => 'DATA';

           print hello( { name => 'Rob' } ), "\n";

           print goodbye( { name => 'Rob' } ), "\n";

           __DATA__
           __TT__
           [% BLOCK hello %]
           <H1> Hello [% name %], how are you? </H1>
           [% END %]
           [% BLOCK goodbye %]
           <H1> Goodbye [% name %], have a nice day. </H1>
           [% END %]

       Alternatively:

           use Inline TT => << EO_TEMPLATE
           [% BLOCK hello %]
           <H1> Hello [% name %], how are you? </H1>
           [% END %]
           EO_TEMPLATE

           print hello( { name => 'Rob' } ), "\n";

       See the Inline perldoc for even more ways to reference the inline
       source.

DESCRIPTION
       "Inline::TT" provides Inline access to version 2.0 and higher of the
       Template Toolkit.  This allows you to house your templates inside the
       source code file, while retaining the ability to cache compiled
       templates on the disk (via Inline's caching mechanism).

       The names of the blocks in the template are exported as functions.
       Call these with a reference to a hash of values, which will be used for
       interpolation in the templates.  This hash reference is the same as the
       second argument to the "process" method of any Template object.  The
       output from template toolkit will be returned to you as a single
       string.  Note that leading and trailing spaces are trimmed, further the
       template toolkit options PRE_CHOMP and POST_CHOMP are set.  Currently,
       there is no way to change these behaviors.

OPTIONS
       You can pass options to Inline::TT.  Two of the options are specific to
       Inline::TT:

       TRIM_LEADING_SPACES
           Set this to one to remove all leading spaces from the text
           generated by TT.  You should also consider using PRE_CHOMP, if you
           use PROCESS or INCLUDE directives.

       TRIM_TRAILING_SPACES
           Set this to one to remove all trailing spaces from the text
           generated by TT.  You should also consider using POST_CHOMP, if you
           use PROCESS or INCLUDE directives.

       These two options work on the final and complete string.  They don't
       remove ANY interior spaces, only the ones at the beginning and end of
       the whole string.

       The rest of the options are passed without comment or validation
       directly to TT.

       Note passing options can be done at compile time or at run time.  To do
       it at run time, use Inline->bind.  See t/06_options for examples of
       passing options at run time and at compile time.

RATIONALE
       Some people (including me at times) prefer to separate formatting from
       code, but not by much.  For example, we don't like to have xml embedded
       inside Perl, but we don't want to have to hunt on the disk for a
       template whose name is likely hidden in a config file (a config file
       whose name we may not even remember).  By using Inline::TT, we can
       store the templates in the program, but away from the code that
       supplies their data.  Yet, because of the wonders of Inline, we still
       benefit from disk based caching of templates.  (For details about
       caching see the Inline documentation, search for _Inline.)

   EXPORT
       The names you used for the BLOCKs in the template, are exported into
       your calling package as sub names.

LIMITATIONS and KNOWN BUGS
       Only things in BLOCKs are accessible through Inline::TT.

SEE ALSO
       This module is one of many in the Inline:: family.  You must have
       Inline version 0.42 or higher to use this module.  See the Inline
       documenation for how to control the location of files it caches.
