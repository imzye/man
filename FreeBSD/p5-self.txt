NAME
       self - provides '$self' in OO code.

VERSION
       This document describes self version 0.30.

SYNOPSIS
           package MyModule;
           use self;

           # Write constructor as usual
           sub new {
               return bless({}, shift);
           }

           # '$self' is special now.
           sub foo {
               $self->{foo}
           }

           # '@args' too
           sub set {
               my ($foo, $bar) = @args;
               $self->{foo} = $foo;
               $self->{bar} = $bar;
           }

DESCRIPTION
       This module adds $self and @args variables in your code. So you don't
       need to say:

           my $self = shift;

       The provided $self and @args are lexicals in your sub, and it's always
       the same as saying:

           my ($self, @args) = @_;

       ... in the first line of sub.

       However it is not source filtering, but compile-time code injection.
       For more info about code injection, see B::Hooks::Parser.

       It also exports a "self" and a "args" functions. Basically "self" is
       just equal to $_[0], and "args" is just $_[1..$#_].

       For convienence (and backward compatibility), these two functions are
       exported by default. If you don't want them to be exported, you need to
       say:

           use self ();

       Since self.pm uses Sub::Exporter, the exported <self> funciton can be
       renamed:

           use self self => { -as => 'this' };

       For more information, see Sub::Exporter.

       It is recommended to use variables instead, because it's much much
       faster. There's a benchmark program under "example" directory compare
       them: Here's one example run:

           > perl -Ilib examples/benchmark.pl
                     Rate  self $self
           self   46598/s    --  -92%
           $self 568182/s 1119%    --

INTERFACE
       $self, or self
           Return the current object.

       @args, or args
           Return the argument list.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
       self.pm requires no configuration files or environment variables.

DEPENDENCIES
       "B::OPCheck", "B::Hooks::Parser", "Sub::Exporter"

INCOMPATIBILITIES
       None reported.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       In some cases, $self and @args may failed to be injected.

       If you're using 0.30, please ensure that your sub declaration has its
       '{' at the same line like this:

           sub foo {
           }

       Also it's ok to have the entire sub in one line:

           sub foo { }

       Please upgrade to 0.31 if you prefer this style of code:

          sub foo
          {
              $self;
          }

       Extra spaces around sub declarations are handled as much as possible,
       if you found any cases that it failed to work, please send me bug
       reports with your test cases.

       It does not work on methods generated in runtime. Remember, it's a
       compile-time code injection. For those cases, use "self" function
       instead.

       Please report any bugs or feature requests to "bug-self@rt.cpan.org",
       or through the web interface at <http://rt.cpan.org>.
