NAME
       Sub::Current - Get the current subroutine

SYNOPSIS
           use Sub::Current;
           sub f {
               # ...
               if ($some_condition) {
                   # let's recurse!
                   ROUTINE->();
               }
               # ...
           }

DESCRIPTION
       Sub::Current makes available a function ROUTINE(), that returns a code
       reference pointing at the currently executing subroutine.

       In a special block (BEGIN, END, CHECK, INIT, and UNITCHECK in Perl
       5.10) this function will return undef.

       Outside of a special block (that is, at the top level of a program)
       ROUTINE() will return undef as well.

       Note: on perl 5.16.0 and later you can use the built-in "__SUB__"
       instead, enabled by the pragma "use feature 'current_sub'".
