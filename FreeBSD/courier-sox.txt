NAME
       sockd - Socks 5 proxy server

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/local/sbin/sockd {[start] | [stop] | [restart]}

DESCRIPTION
       The sockd server allows applications behind a firewall to establish
       outside network connections. The application makes a connection to the
       sockd server, authenticates itself (if required), then sockd
       establishes a network connection on behalf of the application, then
       transparently transfers the data between the two connections.

       This Socks 5 server does not yet support UDP connections.  sockd
       supports TCP connections only.

       “sockd start” starts the Socks 5 server, reading its configuration from
       /usr/local/etc/socksrc.  “sockd stop” shuts down the Socks server,
       terminating any active connections.  “sockd restart” re-reads the
       server configuration from /usr/local/etc/socksrc without affecting any
       existing network connections.

           Note

           Not all configuration settings are updated by sockd restart. Only
           changes to the “port”, “anonproxy”, “authproxy”, and “prefork”
           settings in /usr/local/etc/sockrc will take effect. Changes to
           other settings require a sockd stop, followed by sockd start to
           take effect.
