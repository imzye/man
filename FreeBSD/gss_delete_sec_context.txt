GSS_DELETE_SEC_CONTEXT(3)               FreeBSD Library Functions Manual (prm)

NAME
     gss_delete_sec_context – Discard a security context

SYNOPSIS
     #include <gssapi/gssapi.h>

     OM_uint32
     gss_delete_sec_context(OM_uint32 *minor_status,
         gss_ctx_id_t *context_handle, gss_buffer_t output_token);

DESCRIPTION
     Delete a security context.  gss_delete_sec_context() will delete the
     local data structures associated with the specified security context, and
     may generate an output_token, which when passed to the peer
     gss_process_context_token() will instruct it to do likewise.  If no token
     is required by the mechanism, the GSS-API should set the length field of
     the output_token (if provided) to zero.  No further security services may
     be obtained using the context specified by context_handle.

     In addition to deleting established security contexts,
     gss_delete_sec_context() must also be able to delete "half-built"
     security contexts resulting from an incomplete sequence of
     gss_init_sec_context() / gss_accept_sec_context() calls.

     The output_token parameter is retained for compatibility with version 1
     of the GSS-API.  It is recommended that both peer applications invoke
     gss_delete_sec_context() passing the value GSS_C_NO_BUFFER for the
     output_token parameter, indicating that no token is required, and that
     gss_delete_sec_context() should simply delete local context data
     structures.  If the application does pass a valid buffer to
     gss_delete_sec_context(), mechanisms are encouraged to return a zero-
     length token, indicating that no peer action is necessary, and that no
     token should be transferred by the application.

PARAMETERS
     minor_status        Mechanism specific status code.

     context_handle      Context handle identifying context to delete.  After
                         deleting the context, the GSS-API will set this
                         context handle to GSS_C_NO_CONTEXT.

     output_token        Token to be sent to remote application to instruct it
                         to also delete the context.  It is recommended that
                         applications specify GSS_C_NO_BUFFER for this
                         parameter, requesting local deletion only.  If a
                         buffer parameter is provided by the application, the
                         mechanism may return a token in it; mechanisms that
                         implement only local deletion should set the length
                         field of this token to zero to indicate to the
                         application that no token is to be sent to the peer.

RETURN VALUES
     GSS_S_COMPLETE      Successful completion

     GSS_S_NO_CONTEXT    No valid context was supplied
