               my $client = WWW::BitTorrent->new( 'site' => $site, 'user' => $user, 'pass' => $pass);

               # Check for errors.
               if ($client->{STAT} == 0) {
                       print "ERROR: " . $client->{ERROR}."\n";
                       exit;

               foreach my $row (@page) {
                       print "Row: " . $row->{name} . "- id: " . $row->{id} ."\n";

DESCRIPTION
       "WWW::BitTorrent" provides an object interface to using two BitTorrent
       based boards: "TBSource", "BrokenStone" (tell me about more).  This
       boards are being update every day with files.  This module allows you
       to search for files in a couple of ways.

       NOTE: any use of this module that is illegal is out of my
       responsibilty.

       This module requires LWP::UserAgent and LWP::Simple.

INTERFACE
               new( [ARGS] )

                       Used to login the Board with the username and password
                       of the board (all arguments are required) and create a new Object of
                       the WWW::BitTorrent module.

                       Arguments:

                       site- The BitTorrents board URL address.
                       user- the username for login the board.
                       pass- the password for login the board.

                       NOTES:  Returns a blessed object anyways.
                               object->{STAT}: 0 - for error (object->{ERROR} - http code)
                                               1 - for success

               browse( $page_number )

                       Returns a list(array) of all rows(ref) from the the '$page_number' page.
                       C<page_number>: number between 0 (first page) and max number of pages.

                       Arguments:

                       page_number- the number of the page you want the rows from.

               search( $keyword )

                       This method do the same as browse just by the search option at the board.
