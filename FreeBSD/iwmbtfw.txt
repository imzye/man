NAME
     iwmbtfw – firmware download utility for Intel Wireless 8260/8265 chip
     based Bluetooth USB devices

SYNOPSIS
     iwmbtfw -d device_name -f firmware_path
     iwmbtfw -h

DESCRIPTION
     The iwmbtfw utility downloads the specified firmware file to the
     specified ugen(4) device.

     This utility will only work with Intel Wireless 8260/8265 chip based
     Bluetooth USB devices and some of their successors.  The identification
     is currently based on USB vendor ID/product ID pair.  The vendor ID
     should be 0x8087 (USB_VENDOR_INTEL2) and the product ID should be one of
     the supported devices.

     Firmware files are available in the comms/iwmbt-firmware port.

     The iwmbtfw utility will query the device to determine which firmware
     image and board configuration to load in at runtime.

     The options are as follows:

     -D      Enable verbose debugging.

     -d device_name
             Specify ugen(4) device name.

     -I      Enable informational debugging.

     -f firmware_path
             Specify the directory containing the firmware files to search and
             upload.

     -h      Display usage message and exit.

EXIT STATUS
     The iwmbtfw utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
