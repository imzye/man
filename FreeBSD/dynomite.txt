DYNOMITE(8)             FreeBSD System Manager's Manual            DYNOMITE(8)

NAME
       dynomite - a generic dynamo implementation for different key/value
       storage engines.

SYNOPSIS
       dynomite --help
       dynomite --version
       dynomite [ -c conf-file]
       dynomite [-?hVdDt] [-v verbosity-level] [-o output-file] [-c conf-file]
       [-s stats-port] [-a stats-addr] [-i stats-interval] [-p pid-file] [-m
       mbuf-size] [-M max-alloc-messages]

DESCRIPTION
       Dynomite is a thin, distributed Dynamo layer for different storage
       engines and protocols. Dynomite provides sharding and multi-data center
       replication. It has a shared nothing architecture with no single point
       of failure (SPOF) that delivers high availability (HA) even when a
       server, rack or entire data center goes offline.

       Redis is currently the primary backend and protocol supported by
       Dynomite, while support for Memcached is partially implemented. Future
       versions of Dynomite will support additional backends.

       Dynomite provides the following functionality:

       •      Linear scalability

       •      High availability (HA)

       •      Shared nothing architecture with symmetric nodes

       •      Multi-data center (DC) replication

       •      Data replication and sharding

       •      Support for any Redis client plus a specialized Dyno client for
              Java

       •      Reduced connections to and lower connection overhead on backend
              storage engines via persistent connections

       •      Observability via easily accessible statistics
