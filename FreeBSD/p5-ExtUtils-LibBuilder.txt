ExtUtils::LibBuilder(3)                    User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       ExtUtils::LibBuilder - A tool to build C libraries.

SYNOPSIS
           use ExtUtils::LibBuilder;
           my $libbuilder = ExtUtils::LibBuilder->new( %options );

METHODS
       Supports all the method from ExtUtils::CBuilder. The following three
       methods were adapted to be used in standalone C libraries.

   new
       This method creates a new ExtUtils::LibBuilder object. While it
       supports all "ExtUtils::CBuilder" methods some might work slightly
       differently (namely the two below).

       You can supply to the constructor any option recognized by
       "ExtUtils::CBuilder" constructor. None of them will be used by
       "LibBuilder".

   link
          $libbuilder -> link( objects     => [ "foo.o", "bar.o" ],
                               module_name => "foobar",
                               lib_file    => "libfoobar$libbuilder->{libext}");

       Options to the link method are the same as the "CBuilder" counterpart.
       Note that the result is a standalone C Library and not a bundle to be
       loaded by Perl.

       Also, note that you can use the "libext" key to retrieve from the
       object the common library extension on the running system (including
       the dot).

   link_executable
         $libbuilder->link_executable( objects => ["main.o"],
                                       extra_linker_flags => "-L. -lfoobar",
                                       exe_file => "foobarcmd$libbuilder->{exeext}");

       The "link_executable" needs, as "extra_linker_flags" options, the name
       of the library and the search path. Future versions might include
       better handling on the library files.

       Also, note that you can use the "exeext" key to retrieve from the
       object the common executable extension on the running system (including
       the dot).
