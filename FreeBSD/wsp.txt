WSP(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 WSP(4)

NAME
     wsp – Wellspring touchpad driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines into
     your kernel configuration file:

           device wsp
           device hid
           device usb

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           wsp_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The wsp driver provides support for the Apple Internal Trackpad device
     found in many Apple laptops.

     The driver simulates a three-button mouse using multi-finger tap
     detection.  A single-finger press generates a left button click.  A two-
     finger tap maps to the right button; whereas a three-finger tap gets
     treated as a middle button click.

     wsp supports dynamic reconfiguration using sysctl(8) through nodes under
     hw.usb.wsp.  Pointer sensitivity can be controlled using the sysctl
     tunable hw.usb.wsp.scale_factor.  Tap to left-click can be controlled
     using the sysctl tunable hw.usb.wsp.enable_single_tap_clicks, set to 0 to
     disable single tap clicks or 1 to enable them (default).

FILES
     wsp creates a blocking pseudo-device file, /dev/wsp0, which presents the
     mouse as a sysmouse or mousesystems type device--see moused(8) for an
     explanation of these mouse types.

SEE ALSO
     sysmouse(4), usb(4), loader.conf(5), xorg.conf(5) (ports/x11/xorg),
     moused(8), sysctl(8)
