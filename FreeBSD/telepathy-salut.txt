TELEPATHY-SALUT(8)              D-Bus services              TELEPATHY-SALUT(8)








NAME
       telepathy-salut - Telepathy connection manager for link-local XMPP

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/local/libexec/telepathy-salut

DESCRIPTION
       Salut implements the Telepathy D-Bus specification for link-local XMPP
       (XEP-0174, often called "Bonjour"), allowing Telepathy clients like
       empathy(1) to communicate with other implementations of link-local
       XMPP, such as iChat. It also extends the protocol to support multicast-
       based chat rooms and collaboration.

       It is a D-Bus service which runs on the session bus, and should usually
       be started automatically by D-Bus activation. However, it might be
       useful to start it manually for debugging.

OPTIONS
       There are no command-line options.

ENVIRONMENT
       SALUT_LOGFILE=filename
              If set, debug output will go to the given file rather than to
              stderr.

       SALUT_DEBUG=type
              May be set to "all" for full debug output, or various
              undocumented options (which may change from release to release)
              to filter the output.  GIBBER_DEBUG=type May be set to "all" for
              full debug output from the Gibber XMPP library used by Salut, or
              various undocumented options (which may change from release to
              release) to filter the output.
