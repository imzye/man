HEXD(1)                 FreeBSD General Commands Manual                HEXD(1)

NAME
     hexd – human-friendly hexdump tool

SYNOPSIS
     hexd [-p] [-g groupsize] [-r range] [-w width] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     hexd prints a human-readable hexdump of the specified files, or standard
     input if omitted.  Its main distinguishing feature is the use of colours
     to visually indicate which range of values an octet belongs to, aiding in
     spotting patterns in binary data.

     The ranges an octet is classified into are zero (0x00), low (0x01..0x1F),
     printable (0x20..0x7E), high (0x7F..0xFE) and all (0xFF).

OPTIONS
     If no file operands are specified, standard input is read instead.
     Available options are listed below.

     -p      Plain: disable colours/formatting.

     -g groupsize
             Number of octets per group, set to 8 by default.

     -r range
             Range of octets to print from each file.  Specified as either
             start-end or start+count, where start and end/count are positive
             integers specified in either decimal, hexadecimal or octal (C-
             style notation).

             When the former syntax is used, both ends of the range are
             optional and default to the start or end of the file when
             omitted.

     -w width
             Number of octets per line, separated into groups (see -g).  Set
             to 16 by default.

ENVIRONMENT
     HEXD_COLORS can be used to override the formatting used by hexd to
     classify octets.  If set, it should consist of space-separated pairs of
     the form key=value, where key is one of 'zero', 'low', 'printable',
     'high' or 'all', and value is an SGR formatting string.  SGR formatting
     is interpreted by your terminal emulator; consult its documentation or
     ECMA-48 for more details.

     For example, the default formatting used when HEXD_COLORS is not defined
     corresponds to the value

           zero=38;5;238 low=38;5;150 high=38;5;141 all=38;5;167

EXAMPLES
     Here are some examples of useful uses of hexd's features.

     hexd -r0x1000+0x200 foo.bin
             Display the 512-byte range in 'foo.bin' starting at offset
             0x1000.  Useful when files contain other embedded files/formats
             at a certain location (e.g.  archive files).

     hexd -r-0x10 *.bin
             Show the first 16 bytes of each of the *.bin files, with a
             heading above each file (if more than one).  This is useful for
             example to compare headers of several samples of an unknown
             format.

     curl -s http://example.com | hexd | less -R
             hexd works as a filter, too.  For paging long hexdumps, less(1)'s
             -R flag is useful.
