RETROARCH-CG2GLSL(6)                System Manager's Manual: retroarch-cg2glsl




NAME
       retroarch-cg2glsl - Shader converter.


SYNOPSIS
       retroarch-cg2glsl [Cg file] [GLSL file output]


       retroarch-cg2glsl [Cg directory] [GLSL directory output]


DESCRIPTION
       retroarch-cg2glsl converts Cg shaders to GLSL shaders. It can convert
       single shaders as well as whole folder structures in batch. 100%
       compatibility is not guaranteed, but almost all shaders should work
       fine. Cg presets (.cgp) are not converted at the moment, but converting
       them is as simple as copying over the .cgp, rename it to .glslp and
       replace references to .cg files to .glsl.


       Requires Python 3 and cgc (nvidia-cg-toolkit) 3.1.


EXAMPLE COMMANDLINES
       Convert a Cg shader to GLSL shader
              retroarch-cg2glsl prog.cg(p) prog.glsl(p)


       Convert a Cg directory to GLSL directory
