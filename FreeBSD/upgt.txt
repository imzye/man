NAME
     upgt – Conexant/Intersil PrismGT SoftMAC USB IEEE 802.11b/g wireless
     network device

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device ehci
           device uhci
           device ohci
           device usb
           device upgt
           device wlan

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_upgt_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The upgt driver supports the USB 2.0 Conexant/Intersil PrismGT series
     wireless adapters based on the GW3887 chipset.

     These are the modes the upgt driver can operate in:

     BSS mode       Also known as infrastructure mode, this is used when
                    associating with an access point, through which all
                    traffic passes.  This mode is the default.

     monitor mode   In this mode the driver is able to receive packets without
                    associating with an access point.  This disables the
                    internal receive filter and enables the card to capture
                    packets from networks which it wouldn't normally have
                    access to, or to scan for access points.

     upgt supports software WEP.  Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is the de
     facto encryption standard for wireless networks.  It can be typically
     configured in one of three modes: no encryption; 40-bit encryption; or
     104-bit encryption.  Unfortunately, due to serious weaknesses in WEP
     protocol it is strongly recommended that it not be used as the sole
     mechanism to secure wireless communication.  WEP is not enabled by
     default.

     The upgt driver can be configured at runtime with ifconfig(8).

FILES
     This driver requires the upgtfw firmware to be installed before it will
     work.  The firmware files are not publicly available.  A package of the
     firmware which can be installed via pkg_add(1) is available:

HARDWARE
     The upgt driver supports USB 2.0 Conexant/Intersil PrismGT series
     wireless adapters based on the GW3887 chipset, among them:

     •   Belkin F5D7050 (version 1000)
     •   Cohiba Proto Board
     •   D-Link DWL-G120 Cohiba
     •   FSC Connect2Air E-5400 USB D1700
     •   Gigaset USB Adapter 54
     •   Inventel UR045G
     •   Netgear WG111v1 (rev2)
     •   SMC EZ ConnectG SMC2862W-G
     •   Sagem XG703A
     •   Spinnaker DUT
     •   Spinnaker Proto Board

EXAMPLES
     Join an existing BSS network (i.e., connect to an access point):

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev upgt0 inet 192.168.0.20 \
               netmask 0xffffff00

     Join a specific BSS network with network name “my_net”:

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev upgt0 ssid my_net up

     Join a specific BSS network with 64-bit WEP encryption:

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev upgt0 ssid my_net \
                   wepmode on wepkey 0x1234567890 weptxkey 1 up

HISTORY
     The upgt driver first appeared in OpenBSD 4.3.

AUTHORS
     The upgt driver was written by Marcus Glocker <mglocker@openbsd.org>.

     The hardware specification was reverse engineered by the people at
     http://www.prism54.org.

CAVEATS
     The upgt driver just supports the USB 2.0 devices (GW3887 chipset) but
     not the USB 1.0 devices containing the NET2280, ISL3880, and ISL3886
     chipsets.  Some further efforts would be necessary to add USB 1.0 support
     to the driver.
