LPR(1)                  FreeBSD General Commands Manual                 LPR(1)

NAME
     lpr – off line print

SYNOPSIS
     lpr [-Pprinter] [-#num] [-C class] [-J job] [-L locale] [-T title]
         [-U user] [-Z daemon-options] [-i numcols] [-1234 font] [-w num]
         [-cdfghlnmprstv] [name ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The lpr utility uses a spooling daemon to print the named files when
     facilities become available.  If no names appear, the standard input is
     assumed.

     The following single letter options are used to notify the line printer
     spooler that the files are not standard text files.  The spooling daemon
     will use the appropriate filters to print the data accordingly.  Note
     that not all spoolers implement filters for all data types, and some
     sites may use these types for other purposes than the ones described
     here.

     -d      The files are assumed to contain data in DVI format from the TeX
             typesetting system.

     -f      Use a filter which interprets the first character of each line as
             a standard FORTRAN carriage control character.

     -l      Use a filter which allows control characters to be printed and
             suppresses page breaks.

     -p      Use pr(1) to format the files.

     The following options are historical and not directly supported by any
     software included in FreeBSD.

     -c      The files are assumed to contain data produced by cifplot(1).

     -g      The files are assumed to contain standard plot data as produced
             by the UNIX plot(3) routines.

     -n      The files are assumed to contain data from ditroff (device
             independent troff).

     -t      The files are assumed to contain C/A/T phototypesetter commands
             from ancient versions of UNIX troff(1).

     -v      The files are assumed to contain a raster image for devices like
             the Benson Varian.

     These options apply to the handling of the print job:

     -P      Force output to a specific printer.  Normally, the default
             printer is used (site dependent), or the value of the environment
             variable PRINTER is used.

     -h      Suppress the printing of the burst page.

     -m      Send mail upon completion.

     -r      Remove the file upon completion of spooling or upon completion of
             printing (with the -s option).

     -s      Use symbolic links.  Usually files are copied to the spool
             directory.  The -s option will use symlink(2) to link data files
             rather than trying to copy them so large files can be printed.
             This means the files should not be modified or removed until they
             have been printed.

     The remaining options apply to copies, the page display, and headers:

     -#num   The quantity num is the number of copies desired of each file
             named.  For example,

                   lpr -#3 foo.c bar.c more.c
             would result in 3 copies of the file foo.c, followed by 3 copies
             of the file bar.c, etc.  On the other hand,

                   cat foo.c bar.c more.c | lpr -#3

             will give three copies of the concatenation of the files.  Often
             a site will disable this feature to encourage use of a
             photocopier instead.

     -[1234] font
             Specifies a font to be mounted on font position i.  The daemon
             will construct a .railmag file referencing the font pathname.

     -C class
             Job classification to use on the burst page.  For example,

                   lpr -C EECS foo.c

             causes the system name (the name returned by hostname(1)) to be
             replaced on the burst page by EECS, and the file foo.c to be
             printed.

     -J job  Job name to print on the burst page.  Normally, the first file's
             name is used.

     -L locale
             Use locale specified as argument instead of one found in
             environment.  (Only effective when filtering through pr(1) is
             requested using the -p option.)

     -T title
             Title name for pr(1), instead of the file name.

     -U user
             User name to print on the burst page, also for accounting
             purposes.  This option is only honored if the real user-id is
             daemon (or that specified in the printcap file instead of
             daemon), and is intended for those instances where print filters
             wish to requeue jobs.

     -Z daemon-options
             Some spoolers, such as LPRng, accept additional per-job options
             using a ‘Z’ control line.  When -Z is specified, and -p (pr(1))
             is not requested, the specified daemon-options will be passed to
             the remote LPRng spooler.

     -i numcols
             The output is indented by (numcols).

     -w num  Uses num as the page width for pr(1).

ENVIRONMENT
     If the following environment variable exists, it is used by lpr:

     PRINTER  Specifies an alternate default printer.

FILES
     /etc/passwd              Personal identification.
     /etc/printcap            Printer capabilities data base.
     /usr/sbin/lpd            Line printer daemons.
     /var/spool/output/*      Directories used for spooling.
     /var/spool/output/*/cf*  Daemon control files.
     /var/spool/output/*/df*  Data files specified in "cf" files.
     /var/spool/output/*/tf*  Temporary copies of "cf" files.

DIAGNOSTICS
     If you try to spool too large a file, it will be truncated.  The lpr
     utility will object to printing binary files.  If a user other than root
     prints a file and spooling is disabled, lpr will print a message saying
     so and will not put jobs in the queue.  If a connection to lpd(8) on the
     local machine cannot be made, lpr will say that the daemon cannot be
     started.  Diagnostics may be printed in the daemon's log file regarding
     missing spool files by lpd(8).

HISTORY
     The lpr command appeared in 3BSD.

BUGS
     Fonts for troff(1) and TeX reside on the host with the printer.  It is
     currently not possible to use local font libraries.

     The ‘Z’ control file line is used for two different purposes; for
     standard FreeBSD lpd(8), it specifies a locale to be passed to pr(1).
     For LPRng lpd(8), it specifies additional options to be interpreted by
     the spooler's input and output filters.  When submitting jobs via lpr, -p
     -L locale is used in the former context, and -Z daemon-options is used in
     the latter.
