     cdecl – decode C type declarations

SYNOPSIS

     description.  Casts are accepted as well.

     The options are as follows:

     -o file
             Set the output destination to file.

     -V      Print version information on standard output then exit.

EXAMPLES

     void (*signal(int sig, void (*func)(int)))(int);
     (const char *)s;
     (void (*)(int))signal_function;
