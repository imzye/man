NAME
       tkmore - a Perl/Tk based pager

SYNOPSIS
           tkmore [X11 options] [-i] [-encoding encoding] filename

DESCRIPTION
       tkmore is a pager similar to more(1) or less(1).

   OPTIONS
       Besides standard X11 options like "-font", tkmore supports:

       -i  Turn on case-insensitive search. Alias: "-ignore-case".

       -encoding encoding
           Specify the encoding for the specified file and all subsequently
           loaded files. By default no encoding is assumed.

       -S  Set wrap mode to none. The effect is similar like the "-S" option
           of "less".
