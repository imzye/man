NAME
       mbconvert - convert between file formats supported by MOAB

SYNOPSIS
       mbconvert [-h|-l]

       mbconvert [-f format ] [-a sat_file |-A] [-t] [-g] [-o option ] [-O
       option ] [-I dim ] [-p|-P] [-v vol_id_list ] [-s surf_id_list ] [-c
       curve_id_list ] [-V vert_id_list ] [-m block_id_list ] [-d
       nodeset_id_list ] [-n sideset_id_list ] [-1] [-2] [-3] input_file [
       input_file2 ...] output_file

DESCRIPTION
       mbconvert uses the MOAB library to translate between mesh file formats
       or to extract subsets of mesh files.  The type of the output file is
       determined from the file extension if the -f flag is not specified.
       The -l option can be used to list the file formats supported.

       The id_list passed to many of the subset options can contain either
       individual IDs or ranges of IDs, separated by  a comma (',').  Ranges
       of IDs are specified with a pair of values separated by a dash ('-').
       An ID list may not contain spaces.

       Any combination of subset options, including repetition of a singe
       option with different ID lists may be specified.  The output will
       contain the union of all of the subset options.  If no subset options
       are specified the entire input mesh is written to the output file.

       String options for use with the -o and -O flags are documented in the
       README.IO file.


OPTIONS
       -h     Print help to stdout and exit.

       -l     List supported file formats to stdout.

       -a sat_file
              File to store extracted geometry from .cub file.

       -A     Do not store extracted geometry from .cub file (depricated,
              default).

       -O option
              Specify writer option.  Specify flag multiple times to specify
              multiple options.

       -o option
              Specify reader option.  Specify flag multiple times to specify
              multiple options.

       -t     Print timing data for read and write operations to stdout.

       -g     Print verbose debugging and status information to stdout.

       -I dim Generate internal/adjacent entities of specified dimension.

       -P     Parallel only: append '.' and proccessor rank in world comm to
              output file name.

       -p     Parallel only: replace every occurance of '%' symbol in both
              input and output file names with processor rank in world
              communicator.

       -v idlist
              List of IDs of geometric volumes for which the corresponding
              mesh is to be written.

       -s idlist
              List of IDs of geometric surfaces for which the corresponding
              mesh is to be written.

       -c idlist
              List of IDs of geometric curves for which the corresponding mesh
              is to be written.

       -V idlist
              List of IDs of geometric vertices for which the corresponding
              mesh is to be written.

       -m idlist
              List of IDs for material sets (blocks) to write.

       -d idlist
              List of IDs for Dirchlet sets (nodesets) to write.

       -n idlist
              List of IDs for Neumann sets (sidesets) to write.

       -1     Write all one-dimensional mesh entities (edges.)

       -2     Write all two-dimensional mesh entities
              (triangles,quads,polygons)

       -3     Write all three-dimensional mesh entities (tets,hexes,etc.)
