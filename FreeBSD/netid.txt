NETID(5)                  FreeBSD File Formats Manual                 NETID(5)

NAME
     netid – YP network credential file

DESCRIPTION
     Files in netid format are rare.  One lives in the YP map netid.byname.
     The format is rather simple.  Each row consists of two items: a key and a
     value.  When created by mknetid(8) there are three types of records.

     The first type is information about which GIDs a UID has:

     unix.⟨uid⟩@⟨yp-domain⟩ ⟨uid⟩:⟨gid⟩,⟨gid⟩

     The second type contains information about hosts:

     unix.⟨hostname⟩@⟨yp-domain⟩ 0:⟨hostname⟩

     The third type refers to records from a netid file other than the two
     types above.

FILES
     /etc/netid      for lines not generated automatically by mknetid(8)

EXAMPLES
     A configuration file might look like the following:

     unix.10714@kaka 10714:400,10
     unix.jodie@kaka 0:jodie

SEE ALSO
     mknetid(8), yp(8)
