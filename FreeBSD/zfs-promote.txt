ZFS-PROMOTE(8)          FreeBSD System Manager's Manual         ZFS-PROMOTE(8)

NAME
     zfs-promote – promote clone dataset to no longer depend on origin
     snapshot

SYNOPSIS
     zfs promote clone

DESCRIPTION
     The zfs promote command makes it possible to destroy the dataset that the
     clone was created from.  The clone parent-child dependency relationship
     is reversed, so that the origin dataset becomes a clone of the specified
     dataset.

     The snapshot that was cloned, and any snapshots previous to this
     snapshot, are now owned by the promoted clone.  The space they use moves
     from the origin dataset to the promoted clone, so enough space must be
     available to accommodate these snapshots.  No new space is consumed by
     this operation, but the space accounting is adjusted.  The promoted clone
     must not have any conflicting snapshot names of its own.  The zfs rename
     subcommand can be used to rename any conflicting snapshots.
