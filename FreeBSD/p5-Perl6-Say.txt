NAME
       Perl6::Say - "print()", but no newline needed

SYNOPSIS
           # Perl 5 code...

           use Perl6::Say;

           say 'boo';             # same as:  print 'boo', "\n"

           say STDERR 'boo';      # same as:  print STDERR 'boo', "\n"

           STDERR->say('boo');    # same as:  print STDERR 'boo', \n"

           $fh->say('boo');       # same as:  print $fh 'boo', "\n";

           say();                 # same as:  print "$_\n";

           say undef;             # same as:  print "\n";

DESCRIPTION
   Note for Users of Perl 5.10
       You don't need this module.  The Perl 6 "say" function is available in
       Perl 5.10 by saying "use feature 'say';".  Hence, this module is of
       interest only to users of Perl 5.6 and 5.8.

       If you have Perl 5.10 installed, see the 510/ directory in this
       distribution for some elementary examples of "say" taken from "perldoc
       feature".

   General
       Implements a close simulation of the "say" function in Perl 6, which
       acts like "print" but automatically appends a newline.

       Use it just like "print" (except that it only supports the indirect
       object syntax when the stream is a bareword). That is, assuming the
       relevant filehandles are open for output, you can use any of these:

           say @data;
           say FH @data;
           FH->say(@data);
           *FH->say(@data);
           (\*FH)->say(@data);
           say $fh, @data;
           $fh->say(@data);

       but not any of these:

           say {FH} @data;
           say {*FH} @data;
           say {\*FH} @data;
           say $fh @data;
           say {$fh} @data;

   Additional Permitted Usages
       As demonstrated in the test suite accompanying this distribution,
       Perl6::Say::say() can be used in all the following situations.

           $string = q{};
           open FH, ">", \$string;
           say FH qq{Hello World};            # print to a string
           close FH;                          # requires Perl 5.8.0 or later

           use FileHandle;
           $fh = FileHandle->new($file, 'w');
           if (defined $fh) {
               say $fh, qq{Hello World};
               $fh->close;
           }

           use IO::File;
           $fh = IO::File->new($file, 'w');
           if (defined $fh) {
               say $fh, qq{Hello World};
               $fh->close;
           }

           $string = q{};
           open FH, ">", \$string;             # requires Perl 5.8.0 or later
           select(FH);
           say qq{Hello World};
           close FH;

   Interaction with Output Record Separator
       In Perl 6, "say @stuff" is exactly equivalent to
       "Core::print @stuff, "\n"".

       That means that a call to "say" appends any output record separator
       (ORS) after the added newline (though in Perl 6, the ORS is an
       attribute of the filehandle being used, rather than a global $/
       variable).

   IO::Handle::say()
       IO::Handle version 1.27 or later (which, confusingly, is found in IO
       distribution 1.23 and later) also implements a "say" method.
       Perl6::Say provides its own "say" method to IO::Handle if
       "IO::Handle::say" is not available.

   Usage with Older Perls
       As noted above, some aspects of Perl6::Say::say() will not work with
       versions of Perl earlier than 5.8.0.  This is not due to any problem
       with this module; it is simply that Perl did not support printing to an
       in-memory file ("print \$string, "\n";") prior to that point.  (Thanks
       to a CPAN testers report from David Cantrell for identifying this
       limitation.)

WARNING
       The syntax and semantics of Perl 6 is still being finalized and
       consequently is at any time subject to change. That means the same
       caveat applies to this module.

DEPENDENCIES
       No dependencies other than on modules included with the Perl core as of
       version 5.8.0.

       Some of the files in the test suite accompanying this distribution use
       non-core CPAN module IO::Capture::Stdout.  Tests calling
       IO::Capture::Stdout methods are enclosed in "SKIP" blocks and so should
       pose no obstacle to installation of the distribution on systems lacking
       IO::Capture.  (However, the maintainer strongly recommends IO::Capture
       for developers who write a lot of test code.  So please consider
       installing it!)

BUGS AND IRRITATIONS
       As far as we can determine, Perl 5 doesn't allow us to create a
       subroutine that truly acts like "print". That is, one that can
       simultaneously be used like so:

           say @data;

       and like so:

           say {$fh} @data;

       Comments, suggestions, and patches welcome.
