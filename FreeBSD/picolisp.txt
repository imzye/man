NAME
       pil, picolisp - a fast, lightweight Lisp interpreter

SYNOPSIS
       pil [arguments ...] [-] [arguments ...] [+]
       picolisp [arguments ...] [-] [arguments ...] [+]

DESCRIPTION
       PicoLisp is a Lisp interpreter with a small memory footprint, yet
       relatively high execution speed. It combines an elegant and powerful
       language with built-in database functionality.

       pil is the startup front-end for the interpreter. It takes care of
       starting the binary base system and loading a useful runtime
       environment.

       picolisp is just the bare interpreter binary. It is usually called in
       stand-alone scripts, using the she-bang notation in the first line,
       passing the minimal environment in lib.l and loading additional files
       as needed:

              #!/usr/bin/picolisp /usr/lib/picolisp/lib.l
              (load "@ext.l" "myfiles/lib.l" "myfiles/foo.l")
              (do ... something ...)
              (bye)

INVOCATION
       PicoLisp has no pre-defined command line flags; applications are free
       to define their own. Any built-in or user-level Lisp function can be
       invoked from the command line by prefixing it with a hyphen. Examples
       for built-in functions useful in this context are version (print the
       version number) or bye (exit the interpreter). Therefore, a minimal
       call to print the version number and then immediately exit the
       interpreter would be:

              $ pil -version -bye

       Any other argument (not starting with a hyphen) should be the name of a
       file to be loaded. If the first character of a path or file name is an
       at-mark, it will be substituted with the path to the installation
       directory.

       All arguments are evaluated from left to right, then an interactive
       read-eval-print loop is entered (with a colon as prompt).

       A single hyphen stops the evaluation of the rest of the command line,
       so that the remaining arguments may be processed under program control.

       If the very last command line argument is a single plus character,
       debugging mode is switched on at interpreter startup, before evaluating
       any of the command line arguments. A minimal interactive session is
       started with:

              $ pil +

       Here you can access the reference manual (expects the shell variable
       BROWSER to be set, defaults to "w3m")

              : (doc)

       and the online documentation for most functions,

              : (doc 'vi)

       or directly inspect their sources:

              : (vi 'doc)

       The interpreter can be terminated with

              : (bye)

       or by typing Ctrl-D.

FILES
       Runtime files are maintained in the ~/.pil directory:

       ~/.pil/tmp/<pid>/
              Process-local temporary directories

       ~/.pil/rc
              Loaded after interpreter startup

       ~/.pil/viprc
              Loaded by the Vip editor

BUGS
       PicoLisp doesn't try to protect you from every possible programming
       error ("You asked for it, you got it").
