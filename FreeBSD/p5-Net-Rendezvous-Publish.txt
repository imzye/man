Net::Rendezvous::Publish(3)                User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Net::Rendezvous::Publish - publish Rendezvous services

SYNOPSIS
        use Net::Rendezvous::Publish;
        my $publisher = Net::Rendezvous::Publish->new
          or die "couldn't make a Responder object";
        my $service = $publisher->publish(
            name => "My HTTP Server",
            type => '_http._tcp',
            port => 12345,
        );
        while (1) { $publisher->step( 0.01 ) }

DESCRIPTION
METHODS
   new
       Creates a new publisher handle

   publish( %definition )
       Returns a Net::Rendezvous::Publish::Service object.  The following keys
       are meaningful in the service definition hash.

       name
           A descriptive name for the service.

       type
           The type of service.  This is string of the form
           _service._protocol.

       port
           The port on which you're advertising the service.  If you're not
           using a port (and instead just using mDNS as a way of propogating
           other service information) it's common practice to use 9 (the
           discard service)

       domain
           The domain in which to advertise a service.  Defaults to "local."

   step( $seconds )
       Spend at most $seconds seconds handling network events and updating
       internal state.

       At some point I may learn enough of the mDNS protocol to write a pure-
       perl responder.  That'll be nifty.
