NAME
       Image::Imgur - Perl extension for uploading images to http://imgur.com

SYNOPSIS
         use Image::Imgur;
         my $key = "IMGUR-API-KEY"; # dev key
         # if you don't have imgur api key, you can get one here: http://imgur.com/register/api/
         my $url1 = $img_up->upload('http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/3.0/global/header/intl/hdr-globe-east.gif');
         my $url2 = $img_up->upload('/usr/local/www/data/host.jpg');

DESCRIPTION
       Image::Imgur intends to make programmatically possible to upload image
       files to the website http://imgur.com.

       The maximum non-animated file size you can upload is 10MB. However, if
       the image is over 1MB then it will automatically be compressed or
       resized to 1MB, for better viewing on the net. The maximum animated
       file size (both GIF and PNG) is 2MB.

       This module uses LWP and Moose (Mouse will work too).  Also you'll need
       a working internet connection (duh).

   Method Summary
       host($image)
           Given an url or a filename uploads the image to imagur.com and
           returns the url.
