SYNOPSIS
       dmenu-wl [-b] [-i] [-l lines] [-m monitor] [-p prompt] [-fn font] [-nb
       color] [-nf color] [-sb color] [-sf color] [-v]

       dmenu-wl_path

DESCRIPTION
       dmenu-wl is a dynamic menu for Wayland, originally designed for X and
       dwm(1).  It manages huge numbers of user-defined menu items
       efficiently.

       dmenu-wl reads a list of newline-separated items from standard input
       and creates a menu (or displays a notification if using -e). When the
       user selects an item or enters any text and presses Return, their
       choice is printed to standard output and dmenu-wl terminates.

       dmenu-wl_run is a dmenu-wl script used by dwm which lists programs in
       the user's PATH and executes the selected item.

       dmenu-wl_path is a program used by dmenu-wl_run to find and cache a
       list of executables.

OPTIONS
       -e dmenu displays text from stdin with no user interaction.

       -ec    same as -e but text is aligned centrally.

       -er    same as -e but text is aligned to the right.

       -et secs
              when using -e, close the message after the given number of
              seconds

       -b     dmenu appears at the bottom of the screen.

       -h height
              dmenu is drawn at least the given number of pixels high.

       -i     dmenu matches menu items case insensitively.

       -l lines
              dmenu lists items vertically, within the given number of lines.

       -m monitor
              dmenu appears on the given monitor (0-based index or monitor
              name)

       -p prompt
              defines the prompt to be displayed to the left of the input
              field.

       -po prompt
              same as -p but don't wait for stdin - useful for a prompt with
              no selection options.

       -r     Return as soon as a single match is found. i.e. don't wait for
              the user to press return.

       -fn font
              defines the font or font set used.

       -nb color
              defines the normal background color.  #RRGGBBand #RRGGBBAA are
              supported.

       -nf color
              defines the normal foreground color.

       -sb color
              defines the selected background color.

       -sf color
              defines the selected foreground color.

       -v     prints version information to standard output, then exits.

USAGE
       dmenu-wl is completely controlled by the keyboard.  Besides standard
       Unix line editing and item selection (Up/Down/Left/Right,
       PageUp/PageDown, Home/End), the following keys are recognized:

       Tab (Control-i)
              Copy the selected item to the input field.

       Return (Control-j)
              Confirm selection.  Prints the selected item to standard output
              and exits, returning success.

       Shift-Return (Control-Shift-j)
              Confirm input.  Prints the input text to standard output and
              exits, returning success.

       Escape (Control-c)
              Exit without selecting an item, returning failure.

       Control-y
              Paste the current X selection into the input field.
