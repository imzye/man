Net::Amazon::AWSSign(3)                    User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Net::Amazon::AWSSign - Perl extension to create signatures for AWS
       requests

SYNOPSIS
         use Net::Amazon::AWSSign;
         my $awsKey="AWS_Access_Key";  # Get this from AWS if you don't already have one
         my $awsSecret="AWS_Secret_Key";  # Get this from AWS if you don't already have one
         my $awsSign=new Net::Amazon::AWSSign("$awsKey", "$awsSecret");  # New object
         # SOAP
         my $awsSOAPAction=ItemSearch;
         my ($SOAPTimestamp, $SOAPSignature)=$awsSign->SOAPSig($awsSOAPAction);
         # REST
         my $awsASIN='B000002U82';   # Dark Side of the Moon
         my $awsRESTURI="http://webservices.amazon.com/onca/xml?Service=AWSECommerceService&Operation=ItemLookup&ItemId=$awsASIN&ResponseGroup=Medium"; # Simple lookup
         my $awsSignedRESTURI=$awsSign->addRESTSecret($awsRESTURI);  # Returns signed REST query URI for lwp-get, curl, etc.

DESCRIPTION
       This module can be used to sign requests for most Amazon AWS services.
       While this is designed for simple lookups, it should work for pretty
       much any service (i.e. EC2), since the signing method is the same for
       all Amazon services.  If you want to write your own program to use an
       Amazon API, this module might save you some time.  Or, feel free to
       paste it into your own modules as long as you follow the license
       requirements.

       As for available methods, the synopsis / example pretty much says it
       all.  But, in the interest of full documentation...

   METHODS
       •   new Net::Amazon::AWSSign("$AWS_Key", "$AWS_Secret")

           Creates a new object.  If you don't have a AWS key / secret you can
           register to get one free at http://aws.amazon.com/.

       •   SOAPSig($AWS_SOAP_Action)

           Returns values for aws:Timestamp and aws:Signature to be included
           in your SOAP header.  AWS recommends that you use certificate-based
           WS-Security instead of this method, but if you just need to do some
           quick and dirty one-time work it'll get the job done.

       •   addRESTSecret($Unsigned_URI)

           Takes an unsigned REST URI as an argument and returns the signed
           URI.  If the key is not already included in the URI, it will be
           automatically added before signing.

   SPECIAL CHARACTERS
       If you need to insert special characters (most commonly '&') in your
       query string then you should escape them beforehand.  For example:

         my $awsRESTURI="http://webservices.amazon.com/onca/xml?Service=AWSECommerceService&Operation=ItemSearch&SearchIndex=Books&Condition=All&Keywords=Heckle%26Jeckle";

SEE ALSO
       Net::Amazon::Signature  - if AWSSign doesn't meet your needs, then
       maybe this will.
