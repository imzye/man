GETHOSTID(3)           FreeBSD Library Functions Manual           GETHOSTID(3)

NAME
     gethostid, sethostid – get/set unique identifier of current host

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <unistd.h>

     long
     gethostid(void);

     void
     sethostid(long hostid);

DESCRIPTION
     The sethostid() function establishes a 32-bit identifier for the current
     processor that is intended to be unique among all UNIX systems in
     existence.  This is normally a DARPA Internet address for the local
     machine.  This call is allowed only to the super-user and is normally
     performed at boot time.

     The gethostid() function returns the 32-bit identifier for the current
     processor.

     This function has been deprecated.  The hostid should be set or retrieved
     by use of sysctl(3).

SEE ALSO
     gethostname(3), sysctl(3), sysctl(8)

HISTORY
     The gethostid() and sethostid() syscalls appeared in 4.2BSD and were
     dropped in 4.4BSD.

BUGS
     32 bits for the identifier is too small.
