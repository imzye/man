         foreach my $hlist (@hlists) {
             print ($hlist->score, $hlist->uri, $hlist->date, $hlist->rank);
         }

         $x = Search::Namazu::Search(index => '/usr/local/namazu/index',
                                       query => 'foo',
                                       fields => ["uri", "from"]);

         foreach my $rxs (@$x) {

DESCRIPTION
       This module is an interface for Namazu library. Namazu is an implement
       of full text retrieval search system. It is available at:
       http://www.namazu.org/

   OVERVIEW
       The module implements Search::Namazu::Search function for searching.
       When the function is called, it will return the results as an array of
       Search::Namazu::Result object.

       Search::Namazu::Result object has the score, URI, date and ranking as
       results of searching.

   Search::Namazu::Search
       Search::Namazu::Search function has a reference of hash value as the
       argument. Keys for the hash are the following:

       index

       Specify a path of index. If you want to specify a index, you will need
       to specify the path as a scalar value. However, if you want to specify
       some indices, you will need to specify the paths as an array reference.

       For example:

         @result = Search::Namazu::Search(
               index => ['/var/www/index/site1', '/var/www/index/site2'],
               query => 'foo'
               );

         $resultref = Search::Namazu::Search(
               index => ['/var/www/index/site1', '/var/www/index/site2'],
               query => 'bar', returnas => 'reference'
               );

       query

       Specify a query expression as string. Expression syntax is same as
       namazu command.

       sortMethod

       Specify sort method of results. You can use the following values:

       NMZ_SORTBYDATE
           Order by date.

       NMZ_SORTBYSCORE
           Order by score.

       NMZ_SORTBYFIELD
           Order by fields.

       If you ommit this option, it is treated as same as NMZ_SORTBYDATE.

       sortOrder

       Specify sort order of results. You can use the following values:

       NMZ_DESCENDSORT
           Descend order.

       NMZ_ASCENDSORT
           Ascend order.

       If you ommit this option, it is treated as same as NMZ_DESCENDSORT.

       sortField

       Specify field name when you specified sortMethod as NMZ_SORTBYFIELD.

       lang

       Specify language.

       maxhit

       Speciry maximum numbers of hits. Same as MaxHit directive in namazurc.

       maxget

       Speciry result object numbers of hits to limit too many results.  If
       the parameter was omitted, it is assumed same value as maxhit.

       returnas

       Specify return method, if the parameter is set as 'reference', it
       returns a reference of array as a result.

       fields

       Specify you want to get fields as a refrence of array. In the case, the
       result is returned as a reference of array, contains
       Search::Namazu::ResultXS objects.
