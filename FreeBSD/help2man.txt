NAME
       help2man - generate a simple manual page

SYNOPSIS
       help2man [OPTION]... EXECUTABLE

DESCRIPTION
       `help2man' generates a man page out of `--help' and `--version' output.

       -n, --name=STRING
              description for the NAME paragraph

       -s, --section=SECTION
              section number for manual page (1, 6, 8)

       -m, --manual=TEXT
              name of manual (User Commands, ...)

       -S, --source=TEXT
              source of program (FSF, Debian, ...)

              select locale (default "C")

       -i, --include=FILE
              include material from `FILE'

       -I, --opt-include=FILE
              include material from `FILE' if it exists

       -o, --output=FILE
              send output to `FILE'

       -p, --info-page=TEXT

       --version

       EXECUTABLE should accept `--help' and `--version' options and produce
       output on stdout although alternatives may be specified using:

       -h, --help-option=STRING
              help option string

       -v, --version-option=STRING
              version option string

       --version-string=STRING
              version string

       --no-discard-stderr
              include stderr when parsing option output

INCLUDE FILES
       Additional material may be included in the generated output with the
       --include and --opt-include options.  The format is simple:

           [section]
           text

           /pattern/
           text

       Blocks of verbatim *roff text are inserted into the output either at
       the start of the given [section] (case insensitive), or after a
       paragraph matching /pattern/.

       Patterns use the Perl regular expression syntax and may be followed by
       the i, s or m modifiers (see perlre(1)).

       Lines before the first section or pattern which begin with `-' are
       processed as options.  Anything else is silently ignored and may be
       used for comments, RCS keywords and the like.

       The section output order (for those included) is:

           NAME
           SYNOPSIS
           DESCRIPTION
           OPTIONS
           other
           ENVIRONMENT
           FILES
           EXAMPLES

           SEE ALSO

       Any [NAME] or [SYNOPSIS] sections appearing in the include file will
       replace what would have automatically been produced (although you can
       still override the former with --name if required).

       Other sections are prepended to the automatically produced output for
       the standard sections given above, or included at other (above) in the
       order they were encountered in the include file.

       Placement of the text within the section may be explicitly requested by
       using the syntax [<section], [=section] or [>section] to place the
       additional text before, in place of, or after the default output
       respectively.
