Spreadsheet::ParseODS(3)                   User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Spreadsheet::ParseODS - read SXC and ODS files

SYNOPSIS
         my $parser = Spreadsheet::ParseODS->new(
             line_separator => "\n", # for multiline values
         );
         my $workbook = $parser->parse("$d/$file");
         my $sheet = $workbook->worksheet('Sheet1');

WARNING
       This module is not yet API-compatible with Spreadsheet::ParseXLSX and
       Spreadsheet::ParseXLS. Method-level compatibility is planned, but there
       always be differences in the values returned, for example for the cell
       types.

METHODS
   "->new"
       Options

       •   line_separator - the value to separate multi-line cell values with

       •   readonly - create the sheet as readonly, sharing Cells between
           repeated rows. This uses less memory at the cost of not being able
           to modify the data structure.

       •   NoTruncate - legacy option not to truncate the sheets by stripping
           empty columns from the right edge of a sheet. This option will
           likely be renamed or moved.

       •   twig - a premade XML::Twig::XPath instance

   "->parse( %options )"
           my $workbook = Spreadsheet::ParseODS->new()->parse( 'example.ods' );

       Reads the spreadsheet into memory and returns the data as a
       Spreadsheet::ParseODS::Workbook object.

       Options

       •   inputtype - the type of file if passing a filehandle. Can be "ods",
           "sxc" , "fods" or "xml".

       This method also takes the same options as the constructor.
