NAME
       wvkbd - on-screen virtual keyboard for wayland compositors using
       wlroots

SYNOPSIS
       wvkbd-mobintl [OPTIONS]...

       NOTE: Your binary may have a different suffix depending on which layout
       you compiled.

DESCRIPTION
       This project aims to deliver a minimal but practically usable
       implementation of a wlroots on-screen keyboard in legible C. This will
       only be a keyboard, not a feedback buzzer, led blinker, or anything
       that requires more than what's needed to input text quickly. The end
       product should be a static codebase that can be patched to add new
       features.

       --hidden
           Start hidden (send SIGUSR2 to show).

       --alpha int
           Set alpha value (i.e. transparency) for all colors [0-255]

       --swipe rrggbb|aa
           Set color of swiped keys

       --swipe-sp rrggbb|aa
           Set color of swiped special keys

       --text rrggbb|aa
           Set color text on keys

       --text-sp rrggbb|aa
           Set color text on special keys

       --version
           Print version information

       -h, --help
           Print usage help

SIGNALS
       You can send signals to wvkbd to hide/show it (e.g. using kill(1) with
       -s):

       SIGUSR1
           Hide the keyboard.

       SIGUSR2
           Show the keyboard

       SIGRTMIN
           Toggle visibility

COMPOSE BUTTON
       The default mobile international layout features a Compose button (Cmp)
       which, when combined with another key, opens up a layout that offers
       variants for that key. This is similar to functionality that other
       keyboards implemented using a long press (wvkbd has no such notion,
       holding a key will repeat it like on a physical keyboard).

       For example, press Cmp + a to access variants with diacritics like
       á,à,â,ä, etc..

       Most layouts also feature the following that are less obvious:

       •   Press Cmp and . to access more punctuation
       •   Press Cmp and - or , to access 'mathematical' symbols (+,-,=,etc)
       •   Press Cmp and ' or 0 or 9 to access more brackets and quotes
       •   Press Cmp and q to access emojis

       Last, but not least, pressing Cmp + space or Cmp + ⌨  or Cmp + Abc
       opens up an index that allows you to immediately jump to any layout by
       name, even layouts not explicitly added to your layers on startup.
