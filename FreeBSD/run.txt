RUN(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 RUN(4)

NAME
     run – Ralink Technology USB IEEE 802.11a/g/n wireless network device

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device ehci
           device uhci
           device ohci
           device usb
           device run
           device wlan
           device wlan_amrr

     Firmware is also needed, and provided by:

           device runfw

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following lines in loader.conf(5):

           if_run_load="YES"
           runfw_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The run driver supports USB 2.0 wireless adapters based on the Ralink
     RT2700U, RT2800U, RT3000U and RT3900E chipsets.

     The RT2700U chipset consists of two integrated chips, an RT2770 MAC/BBP
     and an RT2720 (1T2R) or RT2750 (dual-band 1T2R) radio transceiver.

     The RT2800U chipset consists of two integrated chips, an RT2870 MAC/BBP
     and an RT2820 (2T3R) or RT2850 (dual-band 2T3R) radio transceiver.

     The RT3000U is a single-chip solution based on an RT3070 MAC/BBP and an
     RT3020 (1T1R), RT3021 (1T2R) or RT3022 (2T2R) single-band radio
     transceiver.

     The RT3900E is a single-chip USB 2.0 802.11n solution.  The MAC/Baseband
     Processor can be an RT3593, RT5390, RT5392 or an RT5592.  The radio can
     be an RT3053, RT5370, RT5372 or an RT5572.  The RT3053 chip operates in
     the 2GHz and 5GHz spectra and supports up to 3 transmit paths and 3
     receiver paths (3T3R).  The RT5370 chip operates in the 2GHz spectrum and
     supports 1 transmit path and 1 receiver path (1T1R).  The RT5372 chip
     operates in the 2GHz spectrum and supports up to 2 transmit paths and 2
     receiver paths (2T2R).  The RT5572 chip operates in the 2GHz and 5GHz
     spectra and supports up to 2 transmit paths and 2 receiver paths (2T2R).

     These are the modes the run driver can operate in:

     BSS mode       Also known as infrastructure mode, this is used when
                    associating with an access point, through which all
                    traffic passes.  This mode is the default.

     Host AP mode   In this mode the driver acts as an access point (base
                    station) for other cards.

     monitor mode   In this mode the driver is able to receive packets without
                    associating with an access point.  This disables the
                    internal receive filter and enables the card to capture
                    packets from networks which it wouldn't normally have
                    access to, or to scan for access points.

     The run driver can be configured to use Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) or
     Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA-PSK and WPA2-PSK).  WPA is the de facto
     encryption standard for wireless networks.  It is strongly recommended
     that WEP not be used as the sole mechanism to secure wireless
     communication, due to serious weaknesses in it.  The run driver offloads
     both encryption and decryption of data frames to the hardware for the
     WEP40, WEP104, TKIP(+MIC) and CCMP ciphers.

     The run driver can be configured at runtime with ifconfig(8).

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev run0 inet 192.168.0.20 \
               netmask 0xffffff00

     Join a specific BSS network with network name “my_net”:

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev run0 ssid my_net up

     Join a specific BSS network with 64-bit WEP encryption:

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev run0 ssid my_net \
                   wepmode on wepkey 0x1234567890 weptxkey 1 up

     Join a specific BSS network with 128-bit WEP encryption:

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev run0 wlanmode adhoc ssid my_net \
               wepmode on wepkey 0x01020304050607080910111213 weptxkey 1

DIAGNOSTICS
     run%d: faild load firmware of file runfw  For some reason, the driver was
     unable to read the microcode file from the filesystem.  The file might be
     missing or corrupted.

     run%d: could not load 8051 microcode  An error occurred while attempting
     to upload the microcode to the onboard 8051 microcontroller unit.

     run%d: device timeout  A frame dispatched to the hardware for
     transmission did not complete in time.  The driver will reset the
     hardware.  This should not happen.
