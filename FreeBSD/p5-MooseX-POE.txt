NAME
       MooseX::POE - The Illicit Love Child of Moose and POE

VERSION
       version 0.215

SYNOPSIS
           package Counter;
           use MooseX::POE;

           has count => (
               isa     => 'Int',
               is      => 'rw',
               lazy    => 1,
               default => sub { 0 },
           );

           sub START {
               my ($self) = @_;
               $self->yield('increment');
           }

           event increment => sub {
               my ($self) = @_;
               print "Count is now " . $self->count . "\n";
               $self->count( $self->count + 1 );
               $self->yield('increment') unless $self->count > 3;
           };

           no MooseX::POE;

           Counter->new();
           POE::Kernel->run();

       or with MooseX::Declare:

           class Counter {
               use MooseX::POE::SweetArgs qw(event);

               has count => (
                   isa     => 'Int',
                   is      => 'rw',
                   lazy    => 1,
                   default => sub { 0 },
               );

               sub START {
                   my ($self) = @_;
                   $self->yield('increment')
               }

               event increment => sub {
                   my ($self) = @_;
                   print "Count is now " . $self->count . "\n";
                   $self->count( $self->count + 1 );
                   $self->yield('increment') unless $self->count > 3;
               }
           }

           Counter->new();
           POE::Kernel->run();

DESCRIPTION
       MooseX::POE is a Moose wrapper around a POE::Session.

METHODS
   event $name $subref
       Create an event handler named $name.

   get_session_id
       Get the internal POE Session ID, this is useful to hand to other POE
       aware functions.

   yield
   call
   delay
   alarm
   alarm_add
   delay_add
   alarm_set
   alarm_adjust
   alarm_remove
   alarm_remove_all
   delay_set
   delay_adjust
       A cheap alias for the same POE::Kernel function which will gurantee
       posting to the object's session.

   STOPALL

KEYWORDS
METHODS
       Default POE-related methods are provided by
       MooseX::POE::Meta::Trait::Object which is applied to your base class
       (which is usually Moose::Object) when you use this module. See that
       module for the documentation for. Below is a list of methods on that
       class so you know what to look for:

NOTES ON USAGE WITH MooseX::Declare
       MooseX::Declare support is still "experimental". Meaning that I don't
       use it, I don't have any code that uses it, and thus I can't adequately
       say that it won't cause monkeys to fly out of any orifices on your body
       beyond what the tests and the SYNOPSIS cover.

       That said there are a few caveats that have turned up during testing.

       1. The "method" keyword doesn't seem to work as expected. This is an
       integration issue that is being resolved but I want to wait for
       MooseX::Declare to gain some more polish on their slurpy arguments.

       2. MooseX::POE attempts to re-export Moose, which MooseX::Declare has
       already exported in a custom fashion.  This means that you'll get a
       keyword clash between the features that MooseX::Declare handles for you
       and the features that Moose handles. To work around this you'll need to
       write:

           use MooseX::POE qw(event);
           # or
           use MooseX::POE::SweetArgs qw(event);
           # or
           use MooseX::POE::Role qw(event);

       to keep MooseX::POE from exporting the sugar that MooseX::Declare
       doesn't like. This is fixed in the Git version of MooseX::Declare but
       that version (as of this writing) is not on the CPAN.
