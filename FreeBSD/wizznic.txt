NAME
     wizznic – brick-matching puzzle game

SYNOPSIS
     wizznic [-f] [-w] [-z mult] [-sw] [-gl] [-glwidth width]
             [-glheight height] [-glfilter filter] [-d packname]

DESCRIPTION
     wizznic is a brick-matching puzzle game, an improved version of Puzznic.
     The challenge is to clear each level of bricks by moving the bricks next
     to each other.  This sounds a lot easier than it is.  The bricks are
     heavy, so you can only push them, not lift them up.

     The options are as follows:

     -f      Start in fullscreen.

     -w      Start in windowed mode.

     -z mult
             Software scale to (320×240) × mult.  This is more CPU intensive
             than OpenGL scaling.

     If wizznic is compiled with OpenGL scaling support, these options are
     available:

     -sw     Disable OpenGL scaling.

     -gl     Enable OpenGL scaling.

     -glwidth width
             Enable OpenGL scaling and set width resolution to width pixels.
             Use −1 for autodetection.

     -glheight height
             Enable OpenGL scaling and set height resolution to height pixels.
             Use −1 for autodetection.

     -glfilter filter
             filter can be one of:
                  0 Sharp/Pixelated
                  1 Smooth/Soft

     For level creators:

     -d packname
             Dumps tga screenshots of each level in the pack packname.  Use
             the tools/updatelevelpreviews.sh script for this, it will also
             cut the screenshots to size.  -d must stand alone with its
             argument—no other flags are allowed at the same time.
