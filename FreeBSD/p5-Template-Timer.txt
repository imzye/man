NAME
       Template::Timer - Rudimentary profiling for Template Toolkit

VERSION
       Version 1.00

SYNOPSIS
       Template::Timer provides inline timings of the template processing
       througout your code.  It's an overridden version of Template::Context
       that wraps the process() and include() methods.

       Using Template::Timer is simple.

           use Template::Timer;

           my %config = ( # Whatever your config is
               INCLUDE_PATH    => '/my/template/path',
               COMPILE_EXT     => '.ttc',
               COMPILE_DIR     => '/tmp/tt',
           );

           if ( $development_mode ) {
               $config{ CONTEXT } = Template::Timer->new( %config );
           }

           my $template = Template->new( \%config );

       Now when you process templates, HTML comments will get embedded in your
       output, which you can easily grep for.  The nesting level is also
       shown.

           <!-- TIMER START: L1 process mainmenu/mainmenu.ttml -->
           <!-- TIMER START: L2 include mainmenu/cssindex.tt -->
           <!-- TIMER START: L3 process mainmenu/cssindex.tt -->
           <!-- TIMER END:   L3 process mainmenu/cssindex.tt (17.279 ms) -->
           <!-- TIMER END:   L2 include mainmenu/cssindex.tt (17.401 ms) -->

           ....

           <!-- TIMER END:   L3 process mainmenu/footer.tt (3.016 ms) -->
           <!-- TIMER END:   L2 include mainmenu/footer.tt (3.104 ms) -->
           <!-- TIMER END:   L1 process mainmenu/mainmenu.ttml (400.409 ms) -->

       Note that since INCLUDE is a wrapper around PROCESS, calls to INCLUDEs
       will be doubled up, and slightly longer than the PROCESS call.
