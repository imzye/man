wmpuzzle(6)                      Version 0.5.3                     wmpuzzle(6)

NAME
       wmpuzzle - WindowMaker dock app 4x4 puzzle

SYNOPSIS
       wmpuzzle [options] [xpm_image_file]

DESCRIPTION
       wmpuzzle provides a 4x4 puzzle on a 64x64 mini window.  It is designed
       to work with the WindowMaker dock, but will work with other window
       managers as well.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              displays a command line summary.

       -a, --auto-save
              automatically save the puzzle state on program exit.

       -k, --keyboard
              enable use of the keyboard for arrow-key navigation.

       -s, --shuffle=count
              shuffle the image count times, defaults to 2000.  Using -s
              prevents loading the saved state from the resource file.

       -v, --version
              displays the version number.

       --display=id
              Set the display to use, e.g. --display=:0.0.

       --geometry=pos
              Set the position of the dock app, e.g. --geometry=+10+10. Note
              that the size (64x64) is hard-coded and cannot be changed.

       The image file must be an XPM file with minimum (and recommended) size
       of 48x48 pixels. If it is larger then the upper left corner will be
       shown.

USAGE
       Left mouse click moves the puzzle tiles, right click saves the current
       state and middle click recovers the last saved state. If -k has been
       specified the arrow keys and key s and key r will do as well.

       If the picture has been completed the last element will be shown.

FILES
       ~/.wmpuzzlerc
              contains the puzzling state of the images. The basename of an
              image file will be used as its identifier. Use option -s to
              ignore this file on startup.

BUGS
       When wmpuzzle complains about not enough free color symbols that's
       because it needs to add six colors to the XPM's color table and found
       no free symbols using the according number of characters per pixel.
       Try to find some unused entries, delete them and correct the size of
       the color table (the third number in the first line), or enlarge the
       number of characters per pixel using some imaging program.
