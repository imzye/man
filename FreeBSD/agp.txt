     controllers.

IOCTLS
     The following ioctl(2) operations can be performed on /dev/agpgart, which
     are defined in <sys/agpio.h>:

     AGPIOC_INFO
             Returns state of the agp system.  The result is a pointer to the
             following structure:

             typedef struct _agp_info {
                     agp_version version;  /* version of the driver        */
                     uint32_t bridge_id;   /* bridge vendor/device         */
                     uint32_t agp_mode;    /* mode info of bridge          */
                     off_t aper_base;      /* base of aperture             */
                     size_t aper_size;     /* size of aperture             */
                     size_t pg_total;      /* max pages (swap + system)    */
                     size_t pg_system;     /* max pages (system)           */
                     size_t pg_used;       /* current pages used           */
             } agp_info;

     AGPIOC_ACQUIRE
             Acquire control of the AGP chipset for use by this client.
             Returns EBUSY if the AGP chipset is already acquired by another
             client.

     AGPIOC_RELEASE
             Release control of the AGP chipset.  This does not unbind or free
             any allocated memory, which is the responsibility of the client
             to handle if necessary.

     AGPIOC_SETUP
             Enable the AGP hardware with the relevant mode.  This ioctl(2)
             takes the following structure:

             typedef struct _agp_setup {
                     uint32_t agp_mode;    /* mode info of bridge */
             } agp_setup;

             The mode bits are defined in <sys/agpio.h>.

     AGPIOC_ALLOCATE
             Allocate physical memory suitable for mapping into the AGP
             aperture.  This ioctl(2) takes the following structure:

             typedef struct _agp_allocate {
                     int key;              /* tag of allocation            */
                     size_t pg_count;      /* number of pages              */
                     uint32_t type;        /* 0 == normal, other devspec   */
                     uint32_t physical;    /* device specific (some devices
                                            * need a phys address of the
                                            * actual page behind the gatt
                                            * table)                       */
             } agp_allocate;

             Returns a handle to the allocated memory.

     AGPIOC_DEALLOCATE
             Free the previously allocated memory associated with the handle
             passed.

     AGPIOC_BIND
             Bind the allocated memory at given offset with the AGP aperture.
             Returns EINVAL if the memory is already bound or the offset is
             not at AGP page boundary.  This ioctl(2) takes the following
             structure:

             typedef struct _agp_bind {
                     int key;         /* tag of allocation            */
                     off_t pg_start;  /* starting page to populate    */
             } agp_bind;

             The tag of allocation is the handle returned by AGPIOC_ALLOCATE.

     AGPIOC_UNBIND
             Unbind memory from the AGP aperture.  Returns EINVAL if the
             memory is not bound.  This ioctl(2) takes the following
             structure:

             typedef struct _agp_unbind {
                     int key;                /* tag of allocation         */
                     uint32_t priority;      /* priority for paging out   */
             } agp_unbind;
