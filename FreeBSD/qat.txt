QAT(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 QAT(4)

NAME
     qat – Intel QuickAssist Technology (QAT) driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device crypto
           device cryptodev
           device qat

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following lines in loader.conf(5):

           qat_load="YES"
           qat_c2xxxfw_load="YES"
           qat_c3xxxfw_load="YES"
           qat_c62xfw_load="YES"
           qat_d15xxfw_load="YES"
           qat_dh895xccfw_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The qat driver implements crypto(4) support for some of the cryptographic
     acceleration functions of the Intel QuickAssist (QAT) device.  The qat
     driver supports the QAT devices integrated with Atom C2000 and C3000 and
     Xeon C620 and D-1500 platforms, and the Intel QAT Adapter 8950.  Other
     platforms and adapters not listed here may also be supported.  QAT
     devices are enumerated through PCIe and are thus visible in pciconf(8)
     output.

     The qat driver can accelerate AES in CBC, CTR, XTS (except for the C2000)
     and GCM modes, and can perform authenticated encryption combining the
     CBC, CTR and XTS modes with SHA1-HMAC and SHA2-HMAC.  The qat driver can
     also compute SHA1 and SHA2 digests.  The implementation of AES-GCM has a
     firmware-imposed constraint that the length of any additional
     authenticated data (AAD) must not exceed 240 bytes.  The driver thus
     rejects crypto(9) requests that do not satisfy this constraint.

HISTORY
     The qat driver first appeared in FreeBSD 13.0.

AUTHORS
     The qat driver was written for NetBSD by Hikaru Abe <hikaru@iij.ad.jp>
     and ported to FreeBSD by
     Mark Johnston <markj@FreeBSD.org>.

BUGS
     Some Atom C2000 QAT devices have two acceleration engines instead of one.
     The qat driver currently misbehaves when both are enabled and thus does
     not enable the second acceleration engine if one is present.
