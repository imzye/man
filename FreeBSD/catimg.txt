CATIMG(1)                   General Commands Manual                  CATIMG(1)



NAME
       catimg - fast image printing in to your terminal


SYNOPSIS
       catimg [-hct] [-w width | -H height] [-l loops] [-r resolution] image


DESCRIPTION
       catimg is a little program written in C with no dependencies that
       prints images in the terminal. It supports JPEG, PNG and GIF formats.


OPTIONS
       -c     Coerce colors to a restricted palette. Allows terminals with
              limited color support to render a more accurate version of the
              image than if it was directly done by the terminal itself.

       -h     Prints a help message

       -H HEIGHT
              Specify the height of the displayed image, passing '0' will use
              terminal height.

       -l LOOPS
              Specify the amount of loops that catimg should repeat a GIF. A
              value of 1 means that the GIF will be displayed twice. A
              negative value implies infinity.

       -r RESOLUTION
              Possible values 1 or 2. Force the resolution of the image. By
              default catimg will check if rendering in higher resolution is
              possible and do so or use the lower one.

       -t     Disables true color (24-bit) support, falling back to 256 color
              escape codes instead.

       -w WIDTH
              Specify the width of the displayed image. When not provided,
              catimg will use the terminal width.
