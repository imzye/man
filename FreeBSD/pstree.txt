PSTREE(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              PSTREE(1)

NAME
     pstree – list processes as a tree

SYNOPSIS
     pstree [-Uw] [-f file] [-g n] [-l n] [-p pid] [-s string] [-u user]
            [rootpid ...]

DESCRIPTION
     Tree sorted output frontend for ps(1).  pstree uses the output of the
     ps(1) program to show nicely formatted process family trees.

     For each rootpid argument, pstree shows one tree rooted at that process.
     By default, if no rootpid argument is given, it shows a single tree
     rooted at process 1.

     The options are as follows:

     -f file    Read input from file instead of running “ps -kaxwwo
                user,pid,ppid,pgid,command”.  If file is a single dash (‘-’),
                pstree reads from standard input.

     -g n       Use graphics chars for tree.  n = 1: IBM-850, n = 2: VT100, n
                = 3: UTF8.

     -l n       Show a maximum of n levels.

     -p pid     Show only parents and descendants of the process pid.

     -s string  Show only parents and descendants of processes containing the
                string in their commandline.

     -U         Do not show branches containing only root processes.

     -u user    Show only parents and descendants of processes of user.

     -w         Wide output, not truncated to terminal width.

ENVIRONMENT
     COLUMNS  The width of the terminal in characters.  This can be set with
              stty(1) columns number.

EXIT STATUS
     The pstree utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Show branches of processes containing “httpd” using VT100 graphic chars:

     $ pstree -g 2 -s httpd

     Show process number “15495” and its descendants:

     $ pstree 15495

     Show process number “15495” and its parents and descendants:

     $ pstree -p 15495
