NAME
       registry

ABSTRACT
       Register Type Libraries with Namespaces

SYNOPSIS
         package main;

         use strict;
         use warnings;
         use registry;

         $registry;

         # $registry->('main')
         # 'main' Type::Registry object

         # or ...
         # return registry object based on caller
         # registry::access('main')

         # and ...
         # resolve type expressions based on caller
         # registry::lookup('ClassName')

DESCRIPTION
       This pragma is used to associate the calling package with Type::Tiny
       type libraries. A $registry variable is made available to the caller to
       be used to access registry objects. The variable is a callback (i.e.
       coderef) which should be called with a single argument, the namespace
       whose registry object you want, otherwise the argument defaults to
       "main".

         package main;

         use strict;
         use warnings;

         use registry 'Types::Standard';
         use registry 'Types::Common::Numeric';
         use registry 'Types::Common::String';

         $registry;

         # resolve type expression using exported variable
         # my $constraint = $registry->('main')->lookup('StrLength[10]')

         # resolve type expression using registry function
         # my $constraint = registry::lookup('StrLength[10]', 'main')

       You can configure the calling package to be associated with multiple
       distinct type libraries. The exported $registry object can be used to
       reify type constraints and resolve type expressions.
