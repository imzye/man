BIOSFONT(4)            FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual            BIOSFONT(4)



NAME
     biosfont – retrieve font bitmaps from BIOS memory

SYNOPSIS
     /dev/biosfont

DESCRIPTION
     The special file /dev/biosfont is an interface to retrieve font bitmaps
     from the BIOS memory.  The fonts represented are the native system fonts.
     The complete ASCII set (256 characters) can be retrieved.

IOCTL INTERFACE
     The characters can be retrieved using the ioctl() call.  The parameters
     are:

     BIOSFONT_ASCII
             The call identifier for to use for biosfont calls.

     &ch     A reference to an instance of t_biosfont which is defined in the
             header file.  t_biosfont has two fields:

             u_char bitmap[8]
                     The output, contains the bitmap scanlines.  The top
                     scanline is stored in bitmap[0], the bottom scanline is
                     stored in bitmap[7].  The scanlines themselves are stored
                     little endian (MSB first).

             u_char nr
                     ASCII code of character to retrieve, range is bound to 0
                     <= nr <= 255

COMPATIBILITY
     Due to a braindead endianness implementation the driver is only
     guaranteed to work on i386 and amd64 architectures.  These are also the
     only architectures known to the author to actually have the bitmap fonts.

FILES
     /usr/local/include/biosfont.h
             The header file to include when accessing the driver.

     /dev/biosfont
             The device node for the driver.

     /boot/modules/biosfont.ko
             The kernel module to load when using the driver.

HISTORY
     The biosfont driver was first written in August 2003, and rewritten in
     April 2006 when the original sources were lost (oops).  It was released
     to the public on May 7, 2006.
