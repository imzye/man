DESCRIPTION
       These functions provide an interface to mouse events from ncurses(3X).
       Mouse events are represented by KEY_MOUSE pseudo-key values in the
       wgetch(3X) input stream.

   mousemask
       To make mouse events visible, use the mousemask function.  This will
       set the mouse events to be reported.  By default, no mouse events are
       reported.  The function will return a mask to indicate which of the
       specified mouse events can be reported; on complete failure it returns
       0.  If oldmask is non-NULL, this function fills the indicated location
       with the previous value of the given window's mouse event mask.

       As a side effect, setting a zero mousemask may turn off the mouse
       pointer; setting a nonzero mask may turn it on.  Whether this happens
       is device-dependent.

   Mouse events
       Here are the mouse event type masks which may be defined:

   getmouse
       Once a class of mouse events has been made visible in a window, calling
       the wgetch function on that window may return KEY_MOUSE as an indicator
       that a mouse event has been queued.  To read the event data and pop the
       event off the queue, call getmouse.  This function will return OK if a
       mouse event is actually visible in the given window, ERR otherwise.
       When getmouse returns OK, the data deposited as y and x in the event
       structure coordinates will be screen-relative character-cell
       coordinates.  The returned state mask will have exactly one bit set to
       indicate the event type.  The corresponding data in the queue is marked
       invalid.  A subsequent call to getmouse will retrieve the next older
       item from the queue.

   ungetmouse
       The ungetmouse function behaves analogously to ungetch.  It pushes a
       KEY_MOUSE event onto the input queue, and associates with that event
       the given state data and screen-relative character-cell coordinates.

   wenclose
       The wenclose function tests whether a given pair of screen-relative
       character-cell coordinates is enclosed by a given window, returning
       TRUE if it is and FALSE otherwise.  It is useful for determining what
       subset of the screen windows enclose the location of a mouse event.

   wmouse_trafo
       The wmouse_trafo function transforms a given pair of coordinates from
       stdscr-relative coordinates to coordinates relative to the given window
       or vice versa.  The resulting stdscr-relative coordinates are not
       always identical to window-relative coordinates due to the mechanism to
       reserve lines on top or bottom of the screen for other purposes (see
       the ripoffline and slk_init(3X) calls, for example).

       •   If the parameter to_screen is TRUE, the pointers pY, pX must
           reference the coordinates of a location inside the window win.
           They are converted to window-relative coordinates and returned
           through the pointers.  If the conversion was successful, the
           function returns TRUE.

       •   If one of the parameters was NULL or the location is not inside the
           window, FALSE is returned.

       •   If to_screen is FALSE, the pointers pY, pX must reference window-
           relative coordinates.  They are converted to stdscr-relative
           coordinates if the window win encloses this point.  In this case
           the function returns TRUE.

       •   If one of the parameters is NULL or the point is not inside the
           window, FALSE is returned.  The referenced coordinates are only
           replaced by the converted coordinates if the transformation was
           successful.

   mouse_trafo
       The mouse_trafo function performs the same translation as wmouse_trafo,
       using stdscr for win.

   mouseinterval
       The mouseinterval function sets the maximum time (in thousands of a
       second) that can elapse between press and release events for them to be
       recognized as a click.  Use mouseinterval(0) to disable click
       resolution.  This function returns the previous interval value.  Use
       mouseinterval(-1) to obtain the interval without altering it.  The
       default is one sixth of a second.

   has_mouse
       The has_mouse function returns TRUE if the mouse driver has been
       successfully initialized.

       Note that mouse events will be ignored when input is in cooked mode,
       and will cause an error beep when cooked mode is being simulated in a
       window by a function such as getstr that expects a linefeed for input-
       loop termination.

RETURN VALUE
       getmouse and ungetmouse return the integer ERR upon failure or OK upon
       successful completion:

          getmouse
               returns an error.

          •   If no mouse driver was initialized, or if the mask parameter is
              zero,

          •   It also returns an error if no more events remain in the queue.

          ungetmouse
               returns an error if the FIFO is full.

       mousemask returns the mask of reportable events.

       mouseinterval returns the previous interval value, unless the terminal
       was not initialized.  In that case, it returns the maximum interval
       value (166).

       wenclose and wmouse_trafo are boolean functions returning TRUE or FALSE
       depending on their test result.

PORTABILITY
       These calls were designed for ncurses(3X), and are not found in SVr4
       curses, 4.4BSD curses, or any other previous version of curses.

       SVr4 curses had support for the mouse in a variant of xterm.  It is
       mentioned in a few places, but with no supporting documentation:

       •   the “libcurses” manual page lists functions for this feature which
           are prototyped in curses.h:

               extern int mouse_set(long int);
               extern int mouse_on(long int);
               extern int mouse_off(long int);
               extern int request_mouse_pos(void);
               extern int map_button(unsigned long);
               extern void wmouse_position(WINDOW *, int *, int *);
               extern unsigned long getmouse(void), getbmap(void);

       •   the “terminfo” manual page lists capabilities for the feature

               buttons           btns    BT       Number of buttons on the mouse
               get_mouse         getm    Gm       Curses should get button events
               key_mouse         kmous   Km       0631, Mouse event has occurred
               mouse_info        minfo   Mi       Mouse status information
               req_mouse_pos     reqmp   RQ       Request mouse position report

       •   the interface made assumptions (as does ncurses) about the escape
           sequences sent to and received from the terminal.

           For instance the SVr4 curses library used the get_mouse capability
           to tell the terminal which mouse button events it should send,
           passing the mouse-button bit-mask to the terminal.  Also, it could
           ask the terminal where the mouse was using the req_mouse_pos
           capability.

           Those features required a terminal which had been modified to work
           with curses.  They were not part of the X Consortium's xterm.

       When developing the xterm mouse support for ncurses in September 1995,
       Eric Raymond was uninterested in using the same interface due to its
       lack of documentation.  Later, in 1998, Mark Hesseling provided support
       in PDCurses 2.3 using the SVr4 interface.  PDCurses, however, does not
       use video terminals, making it unnecessary to be concerned about
       compatibility with the escape sequences.

       The feature macro NCURSES_MOUSE_VERSION is provided so the preprocessor
       can be used to test whether these features are present.  If the
       interface is changed, the value of NCURSES_MOUSE_VERSION will be
       incremented.  These values for NCURSES_MOUSE_VERSION may be specified
       when configuring ncurses:

          1  has definitions for reserved events.  The mask uses 28 bits.

          2  adds definitions for button 5, removes the definitions for
             reserved events.  The mask uses 29 bits.

       The order of the MEVENT structure members is not guaranteed.
       Additional fields may be added to the structure in the future.

       Under ncurses(3X), these calls are implemented using either xterm's
       built-in mouse-tracking API or platform-specific drivers including

          •   Alessandro Rubini's gpm server

          •   FreeBSD sysmouse

          •   OS/2 EMX

       If you are using an unsupported configuration, mouse events will not be
       visible to ncurses(3X) (and the mousemask function will always return
       0).

       If the terminfo entry contains a XM string, this is used in the xterm
       mouse driver to control the way the terminal is initialized for mouse
       operation.  The default, if XM is not found, corresponds to private
       mode 1000 of xterm:

          \E[?1000%?%p1%{1}%=%th%el%;

       The mouse driver also recognizes a newer xterm private mode 1006, e.g.,

          \E[?1006;1000%?%p1%{1}%=%th%el%;

       The z member in the event structure is not presently used.  It is
       intended for use with touch screens (which may be pressure-sensitive)
       or with 3D-mice/trackballs/power gloves.

       The ALL_MOUSE_EVENTS class does not include REPORT_MOUSE_POSITION.
       They are distinct.  For example, in xterm, wheel/scrolling mice send
       position reports as a sequence of presses of buttons 4 or 5 without
       matching button-releases.

BUGS
       Mouse events under xterm will not in fact be ignored during cooked
       mode, if they have been enabled by mousemask.  Instead, the xterm mouse
       report sequence will appear in the string read.

       Mouse events under xterm will not be detected correctly in a window
       with its keypad bit off, since they are interpreted as a variety of
       function key.  Your terminfo description should have kmous set to
       “\E[M” (the beginning of the response from xterm for mouse clicks).
       Other values for kmous are permitted, but under the same assumption,
       i.e., it is the beginning of the response.

       Because there are no standard terminal responses that would serve to
       identify terminals which support the xterm mouse protocol, ncurses
       assumes that if kmous is defined in the terminal description, or if the
       terminal description's primary name or aliases contain the string
       “xterm”, then the terminal may send mouse events.  The kmous capability
       is checked first, allowing the use of newer xterm mouse protocols such
       as xterm's private mode 1006.
