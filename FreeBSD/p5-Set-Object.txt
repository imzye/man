1.32, 2013-05-15 rurban (released 2013-12-13)
       •   Reverts Changes.pod patch RT#85244 as it conflicts with the
           Set::Object pod on metacpan.  Also RT #85246

1.31, 2013-05-13 rurban
       •   Changes.pod patch by Gregor Hermann, debian perl group - RT#85244

1.30, 2013-04-04 rurban (new maintainer)
       •   Fixes for 5.16 and newer - RT#83426 Sort by member names, not the
           refs.  Fix wrong weak test with globals. Changed to lexicals and
           use strict/warnings.

       •   Fix t/misc/segfault.t, check SvMAGICAL before doing "mg_find"

       •   Fixed wrong C format types in warnings and
           "SET_OBJECT_MAGIC_backref".  Added PREREQ_PMs, make Test::LeakTrace
           and Moose an optional dependency for t/misc/more_leaks.t

       •   Improve thread-safety (forbid concurrent writes), but still dealing
           with Attempt to free non-existent shared string and Unbalanced
           string table refcount: (1) for "8" during global destruction.  - RT
           #22760

       •   Add missing typemap entry const char * for 5.6

1.29, 13 Feb 2013
       •   Fixed a typo in a function which really shouldn't exist - RT#79653

       •   Marked a couple of functions as deprecated for removal (including
           the above function).

       •   Fixed the magic cleanup code to use the appropriate macro/function
           to clean up the magic list instead of trying to do it itself.
           Unsurprisingly, fixes a memory leak.  (RT#69967, also RT#67289)

1.28, 22 Jul 2010
       •   Fixed a portability concern for some platforms' C compilers (that
           do not support //-style comments) - RT#52690

       •   Valid SIGNATURE file - RT#50492

1.27, 15 Jan 2009
       •   Fix a typo that affected building against Perls with debugging
           enabled.

       •   A minor #define refactor (Yuval).

       •   Squash some long-standing warnings I had been ignoring for ages and
           Havard Eidnes prompted me to fix by logging an RT ticket for it.

       •   Squash some global clean-up warnings.

1.26, 13 Oct 2008
       •   Methods which destroyed $@ due to internal use of "eval" now
           properly call local($@) (Yuval)

       •   Fix a leak and a corner case with weak set magic, and squash some
           warnings (Yuval)

       •   Define behaviour when dealing with return values from operations on
           weak sets.  No longer hard-coded "Set::Object" - may affect
           Set::Object sub-classes (Sam).

       •   (post-release changelog entry) related to the previous change,
           Set::Object::Weak::set did not use to shift the invocant off the
           stack, which caused result sets to have the inserted sets as
           members.  It now does, fixing this bug.

1.25, 22 Jul 2008
       •   Portability: support Perls before 5.7.3, and make this dependency
           explicit in the Makefile.PL

1.24, 20 Jul 2008
       •   Remove threads test which had inadvertantly slipped into the
           MANIFEST from source control, and add comprehensive documentation
           on the state of thread support in this module.

       •   Correct other silly MANIFEST mistakes.

1.23, 18 Jul 2008
       •   Make behaviour when dealing with items which were "undef" defined.
           Previously it might segfault (or Bus Error on Mac OS X) on some
           operations and Perl versions, or result in an empty string being
           inserted.

       •   Fix a minor compile problem on IRIX, reported by David Cantrell.

1.22, 8 Oct 2007
       •   Sub-classing interface added; it is now much easier to make
           Set::Object subclasses that return objects other than more
           Set::Objects when subclassing.  From Brían Mach Aon Innéirghthe.

1.21, 17 Feb 2007
       •   Fix false negative when Test::Pod::Coverage isn't installed.
           Reported by Anna Bernathova of SuSE.

1.20, 16 Feb 2007
       •   The "->compare" function was returning "disjoint" for empty sets.
           RT#24965.  (Nigel Metheringham)

       •   Document lots of methods that were previously not documented.

       •   Fix Set::Object::Weak::set().  It was not passing its arguments to
           "Set::Object::Weak->new()", which was very broken.

1.19, 23 Jan 2007
       •   remove bogus inclusions of Data::Dumper and Devel::Peek

       •   New class "Set::Object::Weak", which all weak sets should get re-
           blessed into when you call "->weaken".  Also added alternative
           methods of constructing weak sets.

       •   Fix a memory leak with scalar members (the internal hash used to
           store the items was never being freed).  RT#24508.

1.18, 14 Sep 2006
       •   We could only build on gcc due to the use of variadic macros.  use
           "#ifdef" to hide this GCC-specific extension (used only for
           debugging) from non-GCC compilers.

       •   Add note to man page on compatibility of "Storable" serializations
           of "Set::Object"s between revisions.

1.17, 1 Aug 2006
       •   fix compile problem affecting some platforms

1.16, 18 Jul 2006
       •   weak reference support

1.15, 21 Jun 2006
       •   Dumping sets with scalars in them via Storable now works.

1.14
       •   Fix build problem on Win32 (thanks Steffen Goeldner)

1.13
       •   Fix Makefile.PL so this Changes.pod is not delivered as
           "Set::Changes" :-}

       •   Restore compatibility with 5.6.0

       •   Remove some compile-time warnings, please let me know if this
           version does not build on any platform!

1.12, 30 Aug 2005
       •   added patch from Sergey Skvortsov for backwards compatibility with
           Perl versions before 5.8 (include >100k ppport.h!)

       •   removed 'set()' constructor from default export list, as its name
           conflicts with too many other modules.

1.11, 27 Apr 2005
       •   removed debugging &_ func (was causing strange errors on 5.9.1)

1.10, 2 Apr 2005
       •   added 'set()' constructor and use-as-array-ref interface

1.09, 26 Mar 2005
       •   added 'bool' overload operator to "Set::Object".  For backwards
           compatibility, always returns true.

   1.08_02, 14 Jan 2005
       •   Cutting out the "Universe" representation; this module gives plain
           sets only.

       •   documentation fixes

   1.08_01, 12 Jan 2005
       •   First attempt at adding support for scalars.  This version tries to
           work as closely to "Set::Scalar" as possible.

           This approach will not be continued unless there are a lot of
           requests for it to be implemented.  I think it's overly
           complicated, and not what people expect when they want a Set.

1.08, 14 Oct 2004
       •   another segfault bites the dust; this time, avoids a segfault when
           taking a difference between sets of exactly 31 and 0 size.  Same
           root fault as the previous bug, this time I have a test case for
           it, too.

1.07, 16 Aug 2004
       •   yet another segfault fix, this time due to incorrect use of PUSHs
           vs XPUSHs.  There is no test case for this bug unfortunately.

1.06, 1 May 2004
       •   Fixed segfault when attempting to remove items from an empty set
           (fix from Richard Sterling Cox)

1.05, 5 Jan 2004
       •   some segfault fixes with Storable and Perl 5.6.1 (Perl 5.8.1 should
           be OK)

1.04, 3 Aug 2003
       •   added various functions similar to some found in Scalar::Util, but
           with an extra one that performs a function that lays some
           groundwork for Container::Object ("ish_int").

           Some of these functions were in the XS code anyway, and they are
           extremely small, so I didn't see a problem with duplicating them -
           saves an extra dependency.  Plus, Graham Barr won't let me put
           "ish_int" or "is_key" in his module.

           Knowing that they are available will also assist in fixing some
           longer standing bugs in Tangram (eg, using "$obj + 0" to get a
           unique ID when refaddr($obj) would be better)

       •   lots more input marshalling; if you ever end up doing funny things
           to a "Set::Object", then at least now you'll get a clearer error
           message.

       •   more tests; Devel::Cover test coverage now at 91% (stmt), 67%
           (branch)

       •   erroneously putting scalars into "Set::Object"s now no longer dumps
           core.

       •   serialisation of "Set::Object" objects is now possible via the
           Storable module (Data::Dumper still does the wrong thing, but there
           is nothing I can do about that).

1.03, 24 Jan 2003
       •   fixed overload related bug
