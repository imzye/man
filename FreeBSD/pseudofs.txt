PSEUDOFS(9)            FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual           PSEUDOFS(9)

NAME
     pseudofs – pseudo file system construction kit

SYNOPSIS
     #include <fs/pseudofs/pseudofs.h>

DESCRIPTION
     The pseudofs module offers an abstract API for pseudo-file systems such
     as procfs(5) and linprocfs(5).  It takes care of all the hairy bits like
     interfacing with the VFS system, enforcing access control, keeping track
     of file numbers, and cloning files and directories that are process-
     specific.  The consumer module, i.e., the module that implements the
     actual guts of the file system, needs only provide the directory
     structure (represented by a collection of structures declared and
     initialized by macros provided by pseudofs) and callbacks that report
     file attributes or write the actual file contents into sbufs.

     linprocfs(5), linsysfs(5), procfs(5), sbuf(9), vnode(9)

HISTORY
     The pseudofs module appeared in FreeBSD 5.0.
