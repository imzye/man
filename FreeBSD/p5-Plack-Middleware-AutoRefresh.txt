NAME
       Plack::Middleware::AutoRefresh - Reload pages in browsers when files
       are modified

VERSION
       version 0.09

STATUS
SYNOPSIS
           # in app.psgi
           use Plack::Builder;

           builder {
               enable 'Plack::Middleware::AutoRefresh',
                      dirs => [ qw/html/ ], filter => qr/\.(swp|bak)/;
               $app;
           }

DESCRIPTION
       Plack::Middleware::AutoRefresh is a middleware component that will
       reload you web pages in your browser when changes are detected in the
       source files. It should work with any modern browser that supports
       JavaScript and multiple browsers simultaneously.

       At this time, this middleware will only work with backend servers that
       set psgi.nonblocking to true. Servers that are known to work include
       Plack::Server::AnyEvent and Plack::Server::Coro.  You can force a
       server with the "-s" or "--server" flag to "plackup".

CONFIGURATION
           dirs => [ '.' ]                     # default
           dirs => [ qw/root share html/ ]

       Specifies the directories to watch for changes. Will watch all files
       and subdirectories of the specified directories for file modifications,
       new files, deleted files, new directories and deleted directories.

           filter => qr/\.(swp|bak)$/           # default
           filter => qr/\.(svn|git)$/
           filter => sub { shift =~ /\.html$/ }

       Will apply the specified filter to the changed path name. This can be a
       regular expression or a code ref. Any paths that match the regular
       expression will be ignored. A code ref will be passed the path as the
       only argument. Any false return values will be filtered out.

           wait => 5                           # default

       Wait indicated the maximum number of seconds that the client should
       block for while waiting for notifications of changes. Setting this to a
       lower value will not improve response times.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
       This component was inspired by NodeJuice (<http://nodeJuice.com/>).
       NodeJuice provides very similar browser refresh functionality by
       running a standalone proxy between your client and the web application.
       It is a bit more robust than Plack::Middleware::AutoRefresh as it can
       handle critical errors in your app (ie, compile errors).
       Plack::Middleware::AutoRefresh is simpler to setup and is limited to
       Plack based applications. Some of the original JavaScript was taken
       from nodeJuice project as well, although it was mostly rewritten prior
       to release. Thank you to Stephen Blum the author of nodeJuice.

       A huge thank you to the man behind Plack, Tatsuhiko Miyagawa, who help
       me brainstorm the implementation, explained the inners of the Plack
       servers, and re-wrote my broken code.

IMPLEMENTATION
       Plack::Middleware::AutoRefresh accomplishes the browser refresh by
       inserting a bit (1.2K to be precise) of JavaScript into the (x)html
       pages your Plack application on the fly. The JavaScript tries to have
       minimal impact: only one anonymous function and one global flag
       (window['-plackAutoRefresh-']) are added. The JavaScript will open an
       Ajax connection back to your Plack server which will block waiting to
       be notified of changes. When a change notification arrives, the
       JavaScript will trigger a page reload.
