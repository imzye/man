NAME
       Digest::Tiger - a module that implements the tiger hash

SYNOPSIS
        use Digest::Tiger;

        # hash() returns a 192 bit hash
        my $hash = Digest::Tiger::hash('Tiger')

        # hexhash() returns a hex representation of the 192 bits...
        # $hexhash should be 'DD00230799F5009FEC6DEBC838BB6A27DF2B9D6F110C7937'
        my $hexhash = Digest::Tiger::hexhash('Tiger')

DESCRIPTION
       A perl module that implements the tiger hash, which is believed to be
       secure and runs quickly on 64-bit processors.

AUTHOR
       Perl interface by Clinton Wong, reference C code used by Digest::Tiger
       supplied by Ross Anderson and Eli Biham.

       This module is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it

NOTE
       As of version 0.02, hexhash() returns a hex digest starting with the
       least significant byte first.  For example:

        Hash of "Tiger":
         0             7  8            15 16            23
        DD00230799F5009F EC6DEBC838BB6A27 DF2B9D6F110C7937

        Instead of:
         7             0 15             8 23            16
        9F00F599072300DD 276ABB38C8EB6DEC 37790C116F9D2BDF

       The print order issue was brought up by Gordon Mohr; Eli Biham
       clarifies with: "The testtiger.c was intended to allow easy testing of
       the code, rather than to define any particular print order.  ...using a
       standard printing method, like the one for MD5 or SHA-1, the DD should
       probably should be printed first [for the example above]".
