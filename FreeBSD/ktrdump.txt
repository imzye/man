NAME
     ktrdump – print kernel ktr trace buffer

SYNOPSIS
     ktrdump [-cflqrtH] [-i ktrfile] [-M core] [-N system] [-o outfile]

DESCRIPTION
     The ktrdump utility is used to dump the contents of the kernel ktr trace
     buffer.

     The following options are available:

     -c                Print the CPU number that each entry was logged from.

     -l                Poll the kernel ktr trace buffer periodically dumping
                       any new events after each poll.

     -f                Print the file and line number that each entry was
                       logged from.

     -q                Quiet mode; do not print the column header.

     -r                Print relative timestamps rather than absolute
                       timestamps.

     -t                Print the timestamp for each entry.

     -H                Print the thread ID for each entry.

     -i ktrfile        File containing saved ktr trace events; for more
                       information see the ktr(4) manual page.

     -N system         The kernel image to resolve symbols from.  The default
                       is the value returned via getbootfile(3).

     -M core           The core file or memory image to read from.  The
                       default is /dev/mem.

     -o outfile        The file to write the output to.  The default is
                       standard output.
