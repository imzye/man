NAME
     ral – Ralink Technology IEEE 802.11a/g/n wireless network device

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device ral
           device ralfw
           device wlan
           device wlan_amrr
           device firmware

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_ral_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The ral driver supports PCI/PCIe/CardBus wireless adapters based on the
     Ralink RT2500, RT2501, RT2600, RT2700, RT2800, RT3090 and RT3900E
     chipsets.

     The RT2500 chipset is the first generation of 802.11b/g adapters from
     Ralink.  It consists of two integrated chips, an RT2560 MAC/BBP and an
     RT2525 radio transceiver.

     The RT2501 chipset is the second generation of 802.11a/b/g adapters from
     Ralink.  It consists of two integrated chips, an RT2561 MAC/BBP and an
     RT2527 radio transceiver.  This chipset provides support for the IEEE
     802.11e standard with multiple hardware transmission queues and allows
     scatter/gather for efficient DMA operations.

     The RT2600 chipset consists of two integrated chips, an RT2661 MAC/BBP
     and an RT2529 radio transceiver.  This chipset uses the MIMO (multiple-
     input multiple-output) technology with multiple radio transceivers to
     extend the operating range of the adapter and to achieve higher
     throughput.  However, the RT2600 chipset does not support any of the
     802.11n features.

     The RT2700 chipset is a low-cost version of the RT2800 chipset.  It
     supports a single transmit path and two receiver paths (1T2R).  It
     consists of two integrated chips, an RT2760 or RT2790 (PCIe) MAC/BBP and
     an RT2720 (2.4GHz) or RT2750 (2.4GHz/5GHz) radio transceiver.

     The RT2800 chipset is the first generation of 802.11n adapters from
     Ralink.  It consists of two integrated chips, an RT2860 or RT2890 (PCIe)
     MAC/BBP and an RT2820 (2.4GHz) or RT2850 (2.4GHz/5GHz) radio transceiver.
     The RT2800 chipset supports two transmit paths and up to three receiver
     paths (2T2R/2T3R).  It can achieve speeds up to 144Mbps (20MHz bandwidth)
     and 300Mbps (40MHz bandwidth.)

     The RT3090 chipset is the first generation of single-chip 802.11n
     adapters from Ralink.  ral supports station, adhoc, hostap, mesh, wds,
     and monitor mode operation.  Only one hostap or mesh virtual interface
     may be configured at a time.  Any number of wds virtual interfaces may be
     configured together with a hostap interface.  Multiple station interfaces
     may be operated together with a hostap interface to construct a wireless
     repeater device.

     The RT3900E chipset is a single-chip 802.11n adapters from Ralink.  The
     MAC/Baseband Processor can be an RT5390 or RT5392.  The RT5390 chip
     operates in the 2GHz spectrum and supports 1 transmit path and 1 receiver
     path (1T1R).  The RT5392 chip operates in the 2GHz spectrum and supports
     up to 2 transmit paths and 2 receiver paths (2T2R).

     The transmit speed is user-selectable or can be adapted automatically by
     the driver depending on the number of hardware transmission retries.  For
     more information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

EXAMPLES
     Join an existing BSS network (i.e., connect to an access point):

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev ral0 inet 192.168.0.20 netmask
           0xffffff00

     Join a specific BSS network with network name “my_net”:

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev ral0 inet 192.168.0.20 \
               netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_net

     Join a specific BSS network with 40-bit WEP encryption:

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev ral0 inet 192.168.0.20 \
               netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_net \
               wepmode on wepkey 0x1234567890 weptxkey 1

     Join a specific BSS network with 104-bit WEP encryption:

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev ral0 inet 192.168.0.20 \
               netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_net \
               wepmode on wepkey 0x01020304050607080910111213 weptxkey 1

DIAGNOSTICS
     ral%d: could not load 8051 microcode  An error occurred while attempting
     to upload the microcode to the onboard 8051 microcontroller unit.

     ral%d: timeout waiting for MCU to initialize  The onboard 8051
     microcontroller unit failed to initialize in time.

     ral%d: device timeout  A frame dispatched to the hardware for
     transmission did not complete in time.  The driver will reset the
     hardware.  This should not happen.

HISTORY
     The ral driver first appeared in OpenBSD 3.7.  Support for the RT2501 and
     RT2600 chipsets was added in OpenBSD 3.9.  Support for the RT2800 chipset
     was added in OpenBSD 4.3.  Support for the RT2700 chipset was added in
     OpenBSD 4.4.  Support for the RT3090 chipset was added in OpenBSD 4.9.

AUTHORS
     The original ral driver was written by Damien Bergamini
     <damien@openbsd.org>.

CAVEATS
     The ral driver does not make use of the hardware cryptographic engine.

     The ral driver does not support any of the 802.11n capabilities offered
     by the RT2700 and RT2800 chipsets.  Additional work is required in before
     those features can be supported.

     Host AP mode does not support power saving.  Clients attempting to use
     power saving mode may experience significant packet loss (disabling power
     saving on the client will fix this).

     Some PCI ral adapters strictly require a system supporting PCI 2.2 or
     greater.  Check the board's PCI version before purchasing the card as it
     is likely these adapters will not work in systems based on older
     revisions of the PCI specification.
