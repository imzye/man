USFS(4)                FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                USFS(4)

NAME
     usfs – USB device side support for bulk only transport mass storage

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device usb
           device usfs

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           usfs_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     This driver is obsolete.  Users are advised to use cfumass(4) instead.

     The usfs driver provides support for emulating an USB mass storage device
     when the USB stack is activated in USB device side mode (the
     usb_template(4) module is loaded and the hw.usb.template sysctl is set to
     0).

     Upon attach the driver creates a RAM disk which can be read and written.

SEE ALSO
     cfumass(4), umass(4), usb(4), usb_template(4)

HISTORY
     The usfs driver appeared in FreeBSD 8.0.
