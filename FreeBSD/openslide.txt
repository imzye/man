OPENSLIDE-QUICKHASH1SUM(1)       User Commands      OPENSLIDE-QUICKHASH1SUM(1)








NAME
       openslide-quickhash1sum - Print OpenSlide quickhash-1 checksums


SYNOPSIS
       openslide-quickhash1sum [--help] [--version] slide...


DESCRIPTION
       Print OpenSlide quickhash-1 checksums for one or more virtual slide
       files, in a format similar to sha256sum(1).

       quickhash-1 is a non-cryptographic, 256-bit hash of a subset of a
       slide's data.  It uniquely identifies a particular virtual slide, but
       cannot be used to detect corruption or modification of the slide file.


OPTIONS
       --help Display usage summary.


       --version
              Display version and copyright information.


EXIT STATUS
       openslide-quickhash1sum returns 0 on success, 1 if a quickhash-1 could
       not be calculated, or 2 if the arguments are invalid.


NOTES
       openslide-quickhash1sum is a legacy command and no new features will be
       added.  Its replacement is the slide quickhash1 subcommand of
       slidetool(1).


BUGS
       quickhash-1 is not defined for all slide files supported by OpenSlide.
       If a slide does not have a quickhash-1, "No quickhash-1 available" will
       be printed.
