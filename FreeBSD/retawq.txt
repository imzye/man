NAME
       retawq - a multi-threaded web browser for text terminals

DESCRIPTION
       retawq is an interactive, multi-threaded network client (web browser)
       for text terminals on computers with Unix-like operating systems. It is
       written in C, fast, small, nicely configurable, and comfortable; e.g.
       the low-level network communications are performed in a non-blocking
       way, and you can keep open as many "virtual windows" as you want and
       work simultaneously in two of them in a split-screen mode.

       The most recent version of retawq is available on the project home page
       <http://retawq.sourceforge.net/>.

OPTIONS
       retawq provides dozens of compile-time, command-line and run-time
       options, e.g. for internationalization/localization support and proxy
       configuration. Too many to explain them all here, but see also "see
       also"...

BUGS
       This program has no bugs. no bugs. no bugs. no *WHAP* thank you.
       Seriously: this early release of retawq has several known problems. If
       you run into one of them, please try a more recent version - the
       program is continuously improved...
