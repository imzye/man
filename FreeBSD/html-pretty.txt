DESCRIPTION
       html-pretty filters its HTML or SGML input from stdin, or from one or
       more named files given on the command line, and prettyprints it to
       stdout, standardizing the spacing, and providing indentation to expose
       the document structure.

       When its input is just a plain text file in the ASCII or ISO 8859-1
       character sets, a major part of the conversion of text to
       grammatically-correct HTML can be done automatically, especially if the
       -convert-paragraph-breaks option is used.  Section headings, verbatim,
       and tabular material will, however, require manual editing.

       HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the language used to specify
       formatting instructions in text files intended for viewing with
       World-Wide Web (WWW) client programs (browsers), such as amaya(1),
       arena(1), chimera(1), grail(1), hotjava(1), jde(1), lynx(1),
       netscape(1), panorama(1), and xmosaic(1).

       The WWW idea began in late 1992, and because viewer programs support
       display of text, line drawings, color raster images, hypertext links,
       and uniform access to several Internet services, including file
       transfer, in the first two years, the number of WWW servers grew from
       zero to several hundred thousand, and some of the more popular sites
       receive up to twenty-five million accesses a day from all over the
       Internet.  Consequently, many Internet computer users are beginning to
       write HTML documents for their own home pages, and html-pretty is
       written for them.

       The goal of a prettyprinter is to recognize all legal inputs, and
       produce output that is indented to reflect the structure, and in which
       line lengths have been restricted for improved readability.
       Irregularities in coding practice, and outright errors, are more likely
       to be detected in the prettyprinted output, than in the input.

       SGML (Standard General Markup Language, ISO 8879), and its particular
       document type definition instance, HTML, follow a rigorous grammar for
       text markup that makes it possible to clearly identify document parts,
       such as headings, sections, subsections, paragraphs, figures, tables,
       equations, and so on, and files with such standardized markup are
       particularly good candidates for prettyprinting.

       The definition of HTML is still evolving.  Version 2.0 (Fall 1994) is
       implemented by almost all browsers.  Version 3.0, informally called
       HTML Plus, was introduced in March, 1995, and the arena(1) browser was
       developed at the World-Wide Web Consortium, W3C, to serve as a testbed
       for it.

       Although Version 3.0 is a superset of version 2.0, it proved too
       difficult for browser implementors to incorporate support for it in a
       reasonable time, and it was withdrawn in Fall, 1996.  Version 3.2 was
       released on 14 January 1997, but despite its higher version number, it
       lacks many of the new features introduced in version 3.0, notably for
       mathematical markup, but importantly, it does include support for
       figures and tables.  As with version 3.0, there is also a testbed
       browser, this time called amaya(1), and augmented with the ability to
       edit HTML files, providing a (simple-minded) WYSIWYG editor interface
       that some users may find convenient for creating and maintaining HTML
       files.

       At the time of writing in Fall, 1997, only the amaya(1) and netscape(1)
       browsers appear to have implemented all, or most, of HTML 3.2.

       Further information about HTML versions 3.0 and 3.2 can be found on the
       World-Wide Web at the Uniform Resource Locators (URLs)

              http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html32.html

       The next version of HTML, code-named Cougar, is under development, and
       will become version 4.0 when it is finally released.  The first draft
       public release was on 8 July 1997, and a second proposed recommendation
       followed on 7 November 1997.  For details, visit URLs

              http://www.w3.org/TR/PR-html40/

       Interestingly, translations of the version 4.0 specification to at
       least 18 other human languages are in progress: see URLs

              http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-html40/translations.html

       html-pretty recognizes all HTML tags in the grammars of versions 1.0,
       2.0, 3.0, 3.2, and proposed 4.0, plus a few vendor-specific extensions.

       One significant difference between the grammar versions is that the
       HTML tag <P> is a paragraph separator in version 2.0, while it is a
       paragraph begin in later versions, and consequently expects to have a
       matching </P> paragraph end tag that is not required in 2.0.
       html-pretty will supply missing </P> tags, and delete empty <P> ...
       </P> environments.  Since HTML translators ignore unknown tags, this is
       transparent to HTML version 2.0 implementations, and causes no
       problems.

       html-pretty expects that its input is reasonably well-formed. Usually
       it is sufficient that the file can be displayed by one or more WWW
       browsers, producing the expected form.  However, it would be unwise to
       write a large amount of program code without a compiler to check it,
       and it is similarly unwise to write documentation in HTML or SGML
       without at least a validating parser to ensure that the text is
       syntactically correct.

       Fortunately, at least two such programs are publicly available (thanks
       to the generosity of their author, James Clark), nsgmls(1) and
       sgmls(1), together with UNIX shell scripts, html-check(1) and
       html-ncheck(1), to facilitate their use with HTML files.  In addition,
       the nsgmls(1) distribution is accompanied by two SGML tag normalizers,
       sgmlnorm(1) and spam(1), and there is a UNIX shell script,
       html-spam(1), for one of them.  You may therefore find it useful to
       apply html-spam(1), and either html-check(1) or html-ncheck(1), to your
       HTML files, and fix all of the errors that they detect, before
       filtering the files with html-pretty.

       HTML strictly requires a certain amount of boiler-plate to be wrapped
       around the text, and there is ample evidence that most HTML files omit
       these wrappers, because WWW browsers are written to be tolerant of
       grammatical deviations.  html-pretty will supply the wrappers if they
       are omitted; indeed, if given an empty input file, html-pretty produces
       output similar to this:

              <!-- -*-html-*- -->
              <!-- Prettyprinted by html-pretty flex version 1.00 [11-Nov-1997] -->
              <!-- on Tue Nov 11 16:23:39 1997 -->
              <!-- for Nelson H. F. Beebe (beebe@plot79.math.utah.edu) -->

              <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML//EN">

              <HTML>
                  <HEAD>
                      <TITLE>
                          <!-- Please supply a descriptive title here -->
                      </TITLE>
                      <!-- Please supply a correct e-mail address here -->
                      <LINK REV="made" HREF="mailto:beebe@plot79.math.utah.edu">
                  </HEAD>
                  <BODY>
                  </BODY>
              </HTML>

       This example, minus the comments <!-- ... -->, shows the minimal markup
       that should be expected in an HTML file, although the grammar permits
       the HTML, HEAD and BODY environments to be implicitly assumed if they
       are omitted.  While most WWW browsers ignore the DOCTYPE declaration,
       it is essential for SGML parsers, since it identifies the grammar rules
       that apply to what follows.  Two recent WWW browsers, amaya(1) and
       panorama(1), are SGML-grammar based, and may require a valid DOCTYPE
       declaration.

OPTIONS
       Command-line options affect all following filenames.  Option values are
       always provided as separate arguments following the option name.
       Letter case in option names is not significant, although it may be in
       option values.  Option names may be abbreviated to any unique leading
       prefix, unless a shorter prefix is documented.

       Any argument that begins with a hyphen is expected to be an option, and
       will raise an error if it is not recognized.  If a filename begins with
       a hyphen, you therefore need to disguise it by supplying a leading
       directory path.  For example, ./-foo represents the file named -foo in
       the current directory in UNIX.

       GNU- and POSIX-style options of the form --name are also recognized:
       they begin with two option prefix characters.

       For every option -xxx that sets a Boolean flag to be acted upon later,
       there is a corresponding -no-xxx option to override it.  The negative
       forms are normally not required, but are necessary to counteract
       options set in a style file.

       -author       Show author information on stderr and quit after
                     processing any remaining command-line options that
                     precede the next command-line HTML file.

       -blank-line-warning
                     Unlike most word processing and typesetting systems, and
                     ordinary typewritten text, in HTML and SGML, blank lines
                     do not imply a paragraph break, except in verbatim
                     environments.  You can select this option to get warnings
                     about such blank lines.  They will be reduced to a single
                     blank line, leaving space for later manual insertion of a
                     <P> tag, if that was indeed what was intended [default:
                     -no-blank-line-warning].

                     If you specify the -convert-paragraph-breaks option, then
                     this option will have no effect.

       -brief        Brief mode: exclude the standard boiler-plate wrapper of
                     !DOCTYPE, HTML, HEAD, and BODY tags [default: -no-brief].

                     This option, in conjunction with -no-comment-banner, is
                     convenient for prettyprinting small fragments of text,
                     such as from inside a text editor.  It can also be used
                     for portions of larger documents (e.g., chapters of a
                     book) that are not in themselves complete HTML files.

                     This option can be abbreviated to -b.

       -catalogfile filename
                     Specify an alternate catalog file to override the default
                     one.  See the CATALOG DIRECTORY section for more details.

                     This option can be abbreviated to -c.

       -check-tag-nesting
                     Use built-in tables, or tables from style files, of tag-
                     is-contained-in and tag-cannot-contain relations to check
                     that tags are properly nested.  The rules that govern
                     this are very complex, and depend on the grammar level
                     chosen. The precise relations are tabulated in the HTML
                     GRAMMAR CONSTRAINTS section, and the way they are
                     provided to html-pretty is described in the STYLE FILES
                     section.

                     Because this option can lead to a large number of warning
                     messages when optional end tags are omitted, the default
                     is -no-check-tag-nesting.

                     Nevertheless, when a proper SGML parser, such as
                     html-check(1) or html-ncheck(1), is not available, this
                     option can be very helpful in diagnosing errors of tag
                     usage.

       -comment-banner
                     Generate a leading comment banner containing the
                     prettyprinter version number and date, the current date
                     and time, and the personal name and email address of the
                     user who ran the prettyprinter [default:
                     -comment-banner].

       -convert-paragraph-breaks
                     Convert paragraph breaks (sequences of one or more blank
                     or empty lines) to HTML <P> tags [default:
                     -no-convert-paragraph-breaks].

                     This option is intended for converting text files to
                     HTML; it should not be used when the input file is
                     already HTML, unless the intent really is to insert
                     explicit paragraph tags.

                     This option has no effect on blank lines inside verbatim
                     environments.

       -copyright

       -copyleft     Show copyright information on stderr and quit after
                     processing any remaining command-line options that
                     precede the next command-line HTML file.

       -email-address user@hostname
                     Supply an alternate electronic mail address to be used in
                     the comment banner and the LINK tag.  Otherwise, a
                     default address is constructed from the current user name
                     and host name, when that information is available from
                     the operating system.

                     This option may also be spelled -e-mail-address, since
                     both e-mail and email are about equally common
                     abbreviations on the World-Wide Web.

       -extend-style 'style: TAG TAG ...'

       -extend-style 'TAG: TAG TAG ...'
                     These options, whose name can be abbreviated to just -e,
                     provide a quick command-line alternative to the style
                     file feature of the -stylefile option.  They permit you
                     to augment the list of tags associated with a particular
                     formatting style class, or to add a list of tags to the
                     same class as an existing tag (to avoid the need to know
                     the style class names), but only for the duration of the
                     current process.

                     Since a tag can belong to only a single style class at
                     one time, specification of existing tags with these
                     options effectively removes their old style class
                     association.

                     html-pretty distinguishes between the two cases by
                     looking up the first name in its tag table.  If it is
                     entirely in uppercase, then it might be found there.
                     Otherwise, it is a style class name.

                     If the style class is not recognized, an error message is
                     issued with a list of the recognized class names, and
                     execution is terminated after processing any remaining
                     command-line options that precede the next command-line
                     HTML file.  Thus, an option -extend-style foo:bar' or
                     -extend-style help=me' with obviously incorrect class and
                     tag names can be used to coax a list of the valid ones
                     from html-pretty; it will respond with something like
                     this:
                            :1:unknown style [foo] command [BAR] at line 0
                            in style source [command-line]

                            The recognized style classes are:
                                    body doctype font head html
                                    line-break link list list-header
                                    list-item markup-declaration math
                                    math-pair pair paragraph plaintext
                                    public section short standalone
                                    standalone-nocheck title verbatim

                     The output line width in this list is governed by the
                     -width option.

                     You can assign tags to the special style class name
                     default to make them unknown (and also, warned about, if
                     you supply the -unknown-tag-warning option), e.g.,
                     default:blink.

                     Because some operating systems do not allow embedded
                     spaces in command-line arguments, you can separate the
                     tags in the value string with a comma instead of
                     whitespace.  Also, you can use an equals sign instead of
                     a colon after the first word.  For example, the value
                     strings
                            font:A,MEDIUM
                            font=A,MEDIUM
                            'font   =   A    MEDIUM'
                            'font :     A,,,,MEDIUM'

                     all assign tags A and MEDIUM to the font style class.
                     Incidentally, some people prefer A (anchor) tag pairs to
                     be treated this way, rather than their default of being
                     placed on separate lines, even though long hypertext
                     references in <A HREF="..."> make this style hard to
                     read.

                     For more information on this topic, see the STYLE FILES
                     section below.

       -file filename
                     Supply an alternate input filename for use in the output
                     comment banner.  This overrides the actual filename(s),
                     and provides a way to name the output, even when no named
                     input file is available, because standard input is
                     redirected, or comes from a pipe.

       -grammar-level grammar
                     Select a grammar level that in turn will select a
                     suitable style file.  See the CATALOG DIRECTORY and STYLE
                     FILES sections for more details.

                     Lettercase is not significant in grammar-level names.

                     You can use this option, together with the
                     -unknown-tag-warning option, to help detect use of HTML
                     tags that are not part of the grammar.  However, a
                     better, and grammatically rigorous, way to do this is to
                     use a validating SGML parser, such as those accessible
                     via the html-check(1) and html-ncheck(1) scripts.

                     The built-in default grammar level is a union of the HTML
                     grammar levels 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.2, and proposed 4.0, plus
                     selected browser-vendor extensions.

                     A properly-installed html-pretty always supports at least
                     grammar levels 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.2, 4.0, plus one named
                     all which contains a union of all of the grammar styles
                     in the catalog directory.  This will be similar to the
                     built-in default style, but may differ from it in minor
                     details, since it is easier to augment the style file
                     than it is to rebuild and reinstall the software.

                     There is also a `grammar level' named dtd; it augments
                     the normal style rules with additional ones for extra
                     declarations and tags found in SGML and HTML Document
                     Type Definition (DTD) files.

                     If you specify an incorrect grammar level, html-pretty
                     will display a message showing the available levels, and
                     then quit:
                            html-pretty -g foo
                            :1:could not find grammar level [foo] in
                            catalog file [/usr/local/share/lib/html-pretty/catalog]:
                                levels available:  all dtd 2 2.0 3 3.0 3.2 4 4.0

                     If the style file has a public style class entry, the
                     output DOCTYPE declaration will use its value, instead of
                     a built-in default; see the STYLE FILES section below for
                     details.

                     Tip: if you want to find out the differences in the sets
                     of HTML tags accepted by two different grammar versions,
                     use this option with the -print-stylefile and -width
                     options like this:
                            html-pretty -w 0 -g 3.2 -p >foo.3.2
                            html-pretty -w 0 -g 4.0 -p >foo.4.0
                            diff foo.3.2 foo.4.0

                     The difference listing will show just those style classes
                     where the tag lists differ, since each class will be
                     complete on one (possibly long) line.

       -help or -?   Display brief usage information on stderr and quit after
                     processing any remaining command-line options that
                     precede the next command-line HTML file.

       -indent nnn   Set the number of spaces for each indentation level
                     [default: 4].

       -keep-format  Treat the input stream as verbatim text whose visual
                     format is to be exactly preserved.  It will be converted
                     to the body of a preformatted HTML environment, <PRE> ...
                     </PRE>, and all characters will be output unchanged,
                     except for the four characters `<', `>', `&', and `"',
                     which will be translated to SGML entities `&lt;', `&gt;',
                     `&amp;', and either `&quot;' or `&34;' (depending on the
                     grammar level), respectively.

                     This option is useful for converting non-HTML text to
                     HTML when the linebreaking and indentation are already
                     decided, such as preformatted tables, samples of computer
                     program input and output, and programming language
                     fragments.

                     Horizontal tab characters are treated like spaces in
                     HTML, but most Web browsers will display text containing
                     tabs as if each tab caused blank fill up to, and
                     including, the next column which is a multiple of eight,
                     which is the conventional behavior on many systems. The
                     visual appearance is correct if the text is displayed
                     with a fixed-width font, but is usually wrong with a
                     proportionally-spaced font.

                     However, when asked to save the file as plain text, some
                     browsers will save text with tabs, and others will save
                     text with tabs expanded to spaces, thereby preserving the
                     original appearance.  When the same text is cut with the
                     mouse and pasted into another window, some browsers
                     preserve tabs, and others convert it to spaces.  And even
                     more confusingly, a browser that converts tabs to spaces
                     in a saved file may leave tabs intact in cut-and-pasted
                     text!

                     In most cases, tabs are not significant, but they are for
                     UNIX Makefiles, so if your text has significant tabs, you
                     should incorporate a warning that they will likely be
                     destroyed by the Web browser, and will need to be
                     restored manually, or with a pass through a filter such
                     as unexpand(1).

                     html-pretty always treats tabs as ordinary characters,
                     but if you want to be sure of correct display of tabs
                     according to the conventional blank-fill rule, you should
                     filter the input to html-pretty using a tab expander such
                     as expand(1).

                     For Fortran code containing tab characters, the meaning
                     of tabs is context sensitive, and you need to use a
                     Fortran-tab aware converter.  There is no standard UNIX
                     utility to do this, although a local emacs(1) editor
                     function M-x detab-fortran will do the job.

       -logfile filename
                     Redirect warning and error messages from stderr to the
                     indicated filename.  This option is provided for user
                     convenience on poorly-designed operating systems (e.g.,
                     IBM PC DOS) that fail to provide for redirection of
                     stderr to a specified file.

                     This option can also be used for discarding messages,
                     with, e.g., on UNIX systems, -logfile /dev/null.

                     If the file cannot be opened for output, html-pretty will
                     terminate silently with a non-zero exit code, because the
                     internal attempted redirection required the closure of
                     stderr, making it unavailable for printing further error
                     messages.

       -no-blank-line-warning
                     Override an earlier -blank-line-warning option.  Unlike
                     most word processing and typesetting systems, and
                     ordinary typewritten text, in HTML and SGML, blank lines
                     do not imply a paragraph break, except in verbatim
                     environments.  html-pretty will therefore normally
                     silently reduce such blank lines to a single space
                     [default: -no-blank-line-warning].

                     If you specify the -convert-paragraph-breaks option, then
                     this option will have no effect.

       -no-brief     Override an earlier -brief option, so that the standard
                     wrapper !DOCTYPE, HTML, HEAD, and BODY tags are generated
                     [default: -no-brief].

       -no-check-tag-nesting
                     Suppress checks for correct tag nesting [default:
                     -no-check-tag-nesting].

       -no-comment-banner
                     Suppress generation of the default leading comment
                     banner.

                     This option can be abbreviated to -n, since it may be
                     used frequently [default: -comment-banner].

       -no-convert-paragraph-breaks
                     Do not convert paragraph breaks (sequences of one or more
                     blank or empty lines) to HTML <P> tags [default:
                     -no-convert-paragraph-breaks].  Instead, unless the
                     -blank-line-warning option has been given, the empty
                     lines will be reduced to a single space.

       -no-keep-format
                     Override an earlier -keep-format option, and thus permit
                     reformatting of the input stream [default:
                     -no-keep-format ].

       -no-print-stylefile
                     Override an earlier -print-stylefile option, and
                     therefore, do not terminate execution before processing
                     style files [default: -no-print-stylefile].

       -no-quiet     Override an earlier -quiet option, to restore output of
                     warning messages on stderr [default: -no-quiet].

       -no-read-stylefiles
                     Suppress reading of the three default style files (see
                     the STYLE FILES section below) [default:
                     -read-stylefiles].

                     Style files implicitly specified with -grammar-level
                     options, or explicitly specified with -stylefile options,
                     will still be processed.

       -no-trace-opens
                     Override an earlier -trace-opens option, so that file
                     opening attempts are not traced on stderr [default:
                     -no-trace-opens].

       -no-unknown-tag-warning
                     Override an earlier -unknown-tag-warning option, so that
                     unknown HTML tags will not elicit a warning message
                     [default: -no-unknown-tag-warning].

       -no-warnings-in-comments
                     Override an earlier -warnings-in-comments option, so that
                     warning and error messages are written only to stderr
                     (which might have been redirected with the -logfile
                     option) [default: -no-warnings-in-comments].

       -outfile filename
                     Redirect output from stdout to the indicated filename.
                     This option is provided for user convenience on operating
                     systems that fail to provide for redirection of stdout to
                     a specified file.

       -personal-name name
                     Supply an alternate personal name string to be used in
                     the comment banner.  Normally, the personal name is
                     determined via the current user name, when that
                     information is available from the operating system.

       -print-stylefile
                     Print a style file on stdout and quit after processing
                     any remaining command-line options that precede the next
                     command-line HTML file.

                     This option can be abbreviated to -p.

                     The output line width in the style file is governed by
                     the -width option described later.

                     Startup option files, and any preceding -extend-style,
                     -grammar-level, and -stylefile options will already have
                     been processed, and their changes will be reflected in
                     the output produced by this option.

                     Use this option to find out how each recognized tag is
                     processed, and also to get a template style file that you
                     can customize.  The style class names and tag lists are
                     ordered alphabetically for improved readability.  For
                     more details, see the STYLE FILES section below.

       -quiet        Suppress output of warning messages on stderr.  Error
                     messages will, however, not be suppressed.

                     If you really want to discard error messages too, then
                     use the -logfile /dev/null option instead.

       -read-stylefiles
                     Override an earlier -no-read-stylefiles option, so that
                     the three standard style files (see the STYLE FILES
                     section below) are read [default: -read-stylefiles].

       -stylefile filename
                     Name a style file (see the STYLE FILES section below) to
                     augment html-pretty's built-in knowledge of HTML tags.
                     This option may be given more than once, if multiple
                     initialization files are needed.

       -trace-opens  Trace all file-opening attempts, with a one-line message
                     on stderr for each [default: -no-trace-opens].

                     This option can be helpful in analyzing file access
                     failures, and in uncovering the location of default style
                     files and the catalog directory.

       -unknown-tag-warning
                     Unknown HTML tags are always treated as ordinary text,
                     but with this option, you can request that a warning be
                     raised for each of them [default:
                     -no-unknown-tag-warning].

                     While this option is not a substitute for a validating
                     HTML parser, such as html-check(1) or html-ncheck(1), it
                     does provide a simple way to catch use of non-standard
                     tags.  See the -extend-style option for a way to catch
                     specific tags.

       -version      Show version information on stderr and quit after
                     processing any remaining command-line options that
                     precede the next command-line HTML file.

       -warnings-in-comments
                     Write warning and error messages as easily-identifiable
                     single-line HTML comments on stdout [default:
                     -no-warnings-in-comments].  This may facilitate
                     correction of problems in the output file, since the
                     messages can be located by context, rather than by line
                     number in the input file.

                     Messages are always written to stderr as well (which
                     might have been redirected with the -logfile option, or
                     suppressed with the -quiet option).

       -width nnn    Set the maximum output line width [default: 72].  This
                     limit may be exceeded if an excessively long string
                     without embedded spaces is encountered, and it is ignored
                     completely inside preformatted or verbatim text.

                     If you set the line width to 0, it will be treated as
                     `infinite' (i.e., the largest representable integer).  If
                     you set it to a very small value, e.g., 1, then the
                     output will have one word per line, which might actually
                     be useful on occasion!

                     This option can be abbreviated to -w.

FORMATTING CONVENTIONS
       html-pretty groups HTML tags into collections of style classes.  Tags
       within a single style class receive similar formatting.  The built-in
       style-class tag-membership lists recognize a large collection of tags
       from multiple grammar levels, and multiple browser vendor extensions,
       but all of the built-in lists can be modified by the user, as described
       in the -extend-style and -stylefile options above, and the STYLE FILES
       section below.

       The subsections which follow catalog the origins of the recognized
       tags, and then describe the available style classes in alphabetical
       order, listing their default tag members, and briefly sketching how the
       tags are formatted.

       Tags that are not explicitly named in these subsections, or in style
       files that are read at run time, are treated as normal text, and have
       no effect on the indentation or line breaking, other than their
       contribution toward the line length limit.

       Tags in the style classes doctype, line-break, math, plaintext, short,
       standalone, and standalone-nocheck make up the set of HTML tags with
       SGML content EMPTY, which means that end tags for them are forbidden.
       html-pretty will issue warnings about such end tags, but will leave
       their deletion to a human.

   Recognized HTML Tags
       HTML 2.0 contains the following 49 tags: A, ADDRESS, B, BASE,
       BLOCKQUOTE, BODY, BR, CITE, CODE, DD, DIR, DL, DT, EM, FORM, H1, H2,
       H3, H4, H5, H6, HEAD, HR, HTML, I, IMG, INPUT, ISINDEX, KBD, LI, LINK,
       LISTING, MENU, META, NEXTID, OL, OPTION, P, PLAINTEXT, PRE, SAMP,
       SELECT, STRONG, TEXTAREA, TITLE, TT, UL, VAR, and XMP.

       HTML 3.0 augments the 2.0 grammar with 53 additional tags: ABBREV,
       ABOVE, ACRONYM, ARRAY, ATOP, AU, BAR, BELOW, BIG, BOX, BQ, BT, CAPTION,
       CHOOSE, CREDIT, DDOT, DEL, DFN, DIV, DOT, FIG, HAT, INS, ITEM, LANG,
       LEFT, LH, MATH, NOTE, OF, OVER, OVERLAY, PERSON, PRE, Q, RIGHT, ROOT,
       ROW, S, SMALL, SQRT, STYLE, SUB, SUP, T, TAB, TABLE, TD, TH, TILDE, TR,
       U, and VEC.

       These tags are identified by their occurrence in the html.dtd and
       html-3.dtd document type definition files in lines like these:

              <!ENTITY % font " TT | B | I ">
              <!ENTITY % phrase "EM | STRONG | CODE | SAMP | KBD | VAR | CITE ">
              <!ELEMENT (%font;|%phrase) - - (%text)+>
              <!ELEMENT XMP - -  %literal>

       ENTITY declarations define text string substitutions, and ELEMENT
       declarations define the tags recognized by the grammar.

       HTML 3.2 introduced these 21 new tags: APPLET, AREA, BASEFONT, BIG,
       CAPTION, CENTER, DFN, DIV, FILE, FONT, MAP, NUMBER, PARAM, SCRIPT,
       SMALL, STRIKE, STYLE, SUB, SUP, TABLE, and U.

       Proposed HTML 4.0 introduces these 15 new tags: BDO, BUTTON, COL,
       COLGROUP, FIELDSET, FRAMESET, IFRAME, LABEL, NOFRAMES, NOSCRIPT,
       OBJECT, SPAN, TBODY, TFOOT, and THEAD.

   HTML Tag Omission
       The HTML grammar permits certain end tags to be omitted, when their
       implied position can be determined from the grammatical context.  In
       HTML 3.0, this includes the following tags: DD, DT, ITEM, LH, LI, OF,
       OPTION, P, ROW, STYLE, and TR.

       The HTML 3.2 grammar permits these end tags to be omitted: DD, DT,
       INPUT, LI, OPTION, and P.

       The HTML proposed 4.0 grammars permit these end tags to be omitted:
       COLGROUP, DD, DT, LI, OPTION, P, PARAM, TFOOT, THEAD, and TR.

       In all grammar versions, these tags never have end tags: AREA, BASE,
       BR, FRAME, HR, IMG, INPUT, ISINDEX, LINK, META, NEXTID, PARAM, and
       PLAINTEXT.

       In version 3.0, BASEFONT takes an optional end tag, but in succeeding
       versions, it must not have an end tag.

       In version 3.0, STYLE takes an optional end tag, but in succeeding
       versions, it must have an end tag.

       Supporting the tag-omission feature requires the ability to parse a
       complete SGML grammar, which requires a great deal more code than
       html-pretty provides.  Consequently, html-pretty does not support
       optional end tags; based on typical usage, they are expected to be
       always present, or always absent, according to the rules given below.
       Omitted end tags can be automatically supplied by an SGML tag
       normalizer, such as sgmlnorm(1), spam(1), or html-spam(1).

       html-pretty will warn about end tags that should not be present, based
       on the tags' membership in those style classes that are known not to
       have end tags.  However, it will not delete them from the output
       stream, because human judgment may be called for.  See the HTML GRAMMAR
       CONSTRAINTS section below for further details.

   Style Class: body
       The following HTML tag name must occur only once, with a begin/end
       pair, often with substantial amounts of intervening text: BODY.  The
       begin/end tags are prettyprinted on separate lines, with their enclosed
       text indented one level.  However, the BODY environment must occur
       after the HEAD environment, and one level inside the HTML environment.
       html-pretty will supply this environment if needed, unless the -brief
       option has suppressed it.

   Style Class: comment
       Short HTML comments are output inline, like normal text.  Long ones,
       and ones with embedded angle brackets, are prettyprinted on separate
       lines.  Their internal form is preserved exactly, without any line
       wrapping, since they will often contain specially-formatted material.
       Any whitespace between the final "--" and the closing angle bracket
       will be eliminated, when possible.

   Style Class: doctype
       The following HTML tag name occurs only once, and should normally be
       the first non-comment tag in a file: !DOCTYPE.  html-pretty will supply
       this tag if needed, unless the -brief option has suppressed it.
       Strictly, this is not a tag, but rather a markup declaration, but
       html-pretty treats it as a special tag, and outputs it verbatim while
       checking for proper embedded comment balance.  For more details, see
       the COMMENTS IN HTML AND SGML section below.

   Style Class: font
       These HTML tag names occur in begin/end pairs, usually with smaller
       amounts of enclosed material.  They appear inline in the running text,
       and do not alter indentation: ACRONYM, B, BIG, BLINK, BT, CODE, DFN,
       EM, I, KBD, Q, REV, S, SAMP, SMALL, STRIKE, STRONG, T, TT, U, and VAR.

   Style Class: head
       This HTML tag occurs in begin/end pairs, which are prettyprinted on
       separate lines with enclosing text indented one level: HEAD.  However,
       this tag pair must occur only once in a file, and then only inside an
       HTML environment, and before the BODY environment.  html-pretty will
       supply this environment if needed, unless the -brief option has
       suppressed it.

   Style Class: html
       This HTML tag occurs in begin/end pairs, which are prettyprinted on
       separate lines with enclosing text indented one level: HTML.  However,
       this tag pair must occur only once in a file, and then only at the
       outermost level.  html-pretty will supply this environment if needed,
       unless the -brief option has suppressed it.

   Style Class: inline
       Tags in this class are treated as ordinary text, with no additional
       spacing requirements, or checks for enclosing environments.

       Neither the default built-in style, nor any of the standard grammar-
       level-specific style files, use this class.  It is provided to permit
       transparent handling of tags that may be added in future versions of
       the HTML grammars.

       There is a difference in the handling of a member of this class,
       compared to that for a tag which is not defined in any class.  The
       latter may result in warnings if the -unknown-tag-warning option has
       been selected, is allowed only in the BODY environment, and may cause a
       paragraph to end.  A tag in the inline style class may occur in either
       the HEAD or BODY environments, never raises unknown-tag warnings, and
       does not end a paragraph.

   Style Class: line-break
       This HTML tag marks an explicit line break, and has no matching end
       tag; preceding space is deleted, and a newline follows: BR.

   Style Class: link
       This HTML tag has no matching end tag; it appears alone on a separate
       line: LINK.  There is normally at least one LINK tag, in the HEAD
       environment, and html-pretty will supply one automatically if none is
       present in the input stream.

   Style Class: list
       These HTML tags names occur in begin/end pairs, and delimit lists.
       They appear on separate lines, with their enclosed text indented two
       levels: DIR, DL, MENU, OL, and UL.

   Style Class: list-header
       This HTML tag marks the title of a list: LH.  The begin/end tags are
       output on separate lines, indented one level from the enclosing list.

   Style Class: list-item
       These HTML tags mark the beginning of list items, and have matching end
       tags which are supplied if they are absent.  They are output on
       separate lines, indented one level from the enclosing list: DD, DT, and
       LI.

   Style Class: markup-declaration
       The following SGML markup declarations are also treated like special
       tags, and output verbatim while checking for proper embedded comment
       balance: !ATTLIST, !ELEMENT, !ENTITY, !NOTATION, !SGML, !SHORTREF, and
       !USEMAP.  However, html-pretty does no further checking about where
       these `tags' are legal.  Generally, they do not occur in HTML files,
       but are found mainly in DTD files.

   Style Class: math
       These HTML tag names occur only inside a MATH environment, and appear
       inline, without end tags, and without affecting indentation: ATOP,
       CHOOSE, LEFT, OF, OVER, RIGHT, and TAB.

   Style Class: math-pair
       These HTML tag names occur only inside a MATH environment, with
       begin/end pairs, and appear inline, without affecting indentation:
       ABOVE, BAR, BELOW, BOX, DDOT, DOT, HAT, ROOT, ROW, SQRT, SUB, SUP,
       TILDE, and VEC.

   Style Class: pair
       The following HTML tag names occur in begin/end pairs (<TAG>and</TAG>),
       often with substantial amounts of intervening text: A, ABBREV,
       ABSTRACT, ADDED, ADDRESS, APPLET, ARG, AROW, ARRAY, AU, BDO,
       BLOCKQUOTE, BQ, BUTTON, CAPTION, CENTER, CITE, CMD, COLGROUP, CREDIT,
       DEL, DIV, DIV1, DIV2, DIV3, DIV4, DIV5, DIV6, FIELDSET, FIG, FN, FONT,
       FOOTNOTE, FORM, FRAMESET, HIDE, IFRAME, INS, LABEL, LANG, MAP, MARGIN,
       MATH, MESSAGE, NOFRAMES, NOSCRIPT, NOTE, OBJECT, OPTION, PERSON, QUOTE,
       REMOVED, SELECT, SPAN, STYLE, TABLE, TBODY, TD, TEXTAREA, TFOOT, TH,
       THEAD, and TR.  They are prettyprinted on separate lines, with their
       enclosed text indented one level.

   Style Class: paragraph
       This HTML tag occurs in begin/end pairs, which are prettyprinted on
       separate lines with enclosing text indented one level: P.  However,
       paragraphing is tracked, empty paragraphs are discarded, and when new
       tags are encountered which are known to be illegal inside a paragraph,
       any open paragraph is automatically closed.  Thus, old-style HTML files
       with omitted </P> tags will usually get them added.  Unlike most word
       processors and many typesetting systems, blank lines in the SGML and
       HTML input stream do not imply a paragraph break; only the <P> tag
       does.

   Style Class: plaintext
       The HTML tag PLAINTEXT marks the beginning of verbatim text that
       continues to end-of-file; it appears on a separate line.  Although some
       HTML viewers will terminate the plaintext environment on reaching a
       matching end tag, </PLAINTEXT>, that practice is now considered
       erroneous.

       html-pretty will warn about this abberant environment, and recommend
       using <PRE> ... </PRE> instead.

   Style Class: section
       These HTML tags occur in begin/end pairs, which are prettyprinted on
       separate lines with enclosing text indented one level: H1, H2, H3, H4,
       H5, and H6.  However, they must be logically ordered: H1 before H2 ...
       before H6, with no intermediate header levels omitted, and they must
       appear at the first level inside the BODY environment.

   Style Class: short
       This HTML tag has no matching end tag; it appears alone on a separate
       line: ITEM.  However, tags in this class can be used only inside a BODY
       environment, and consequently, html-pretty will automatically end any
       open HEAD environment, and start a BODY environment, if needed.

   Style Class: standalone
       These HTML tags have no matching end tag; they appear alone on separate
       lines: CHANGED, HR, IMG, INPUT, RENDER, STYLES, and WBR.  However, they
       may appear only inside the BODY environment, and outside a paragraph,
       and consequently, html-pretty will automatically end any open HEAD and
       P environments, and start a BODY environment, if needed.

   Style Class: standalone-nocheck
       These HTML tags have no matching end tag; they may appear in either the
       HEAD or the BODY environment, and they appear alone on separate lines:
       BASE, ISINDEX, META, and NEXTID.

       As the class name implies, they are not checked against rules that
       might restrict their placement with respect to other environments.

   Style Class: title
       This HTML tag occurs in begin/end pairs, which are prettyprinted on
       separate lines with enclosing text indented one level: TITLE.  However,
       this tag pair is restricted to occurring only in the HEAD environment,
       and should normally only be given once.  html-pretty will supply this
       environment if needed, unless the -brief option has suppressed it, and
       will warn about multiple occurrences.

   Style Class: verbatim
       These HTML tags appear in begin/end pairs, delimit preformatted, or
       verbatim, text, and may occur only in the BODY environment: LISTING,
       NOBR, PRE, and XMP.  The beginning and ending tags are output on
       separate lines, with no indentation, and with the enclosed material
       copied exactly as it appeared in the input stream.

   Style Class: verbatim-nocheck
       These HTML tags appear in begin/end pairs, delimit preformatted, or
       verbatim, text, and may occur in either HEAD or BODY environments:
       SCRIPT and STYLE.  The beginning and ending tags are output on separate
       lines, with no indentation, and with the enclosed material copied
       exactly as it appeared in the input stream.

       The SCRIPT and STYLE environments are not strictly verbatim
       environments, but since they contain material in one of several
       different scripting (Java, JavaScript, Tcl, VBScript, ...) or style-
       sheet (CSS, ...) languages, there is no reasonable way for html-pretty
       to reformat their contents, so they are included in this style class to
       prevent such reformatting.

STYLE FILES
       In order to allow the user to control the formatting of particular HTML
       tags, html-pretty supports a powerful style file mechanism.  At
       startup, it processes a style file in the directory where the
       executable program was found, a second style file in the user's home
       directory, and a third style file in the current directory.  None of
       these need exist.  Next, during command-line argument processing,
       additional style files can be provided with the -stylefile option.
       These style files support system-specific, user-specific, directory-
       specific, and job- or file-specific prettyprinting control.

       The default name of the first three style files is system dependent:
       .html-prettyrc (UNIX), htmlpty.ini (IBM PC DOS), and html-pretty.ini
       (DEC VMS and OpenVMS).  The exact names depend on the name of the
       executable program, which is used to construct the style file names.
       If you renamed it to sgmlpretty.exe, the names would be .sgmlprettyrc
       on UNIX, and sgmlpretty.ini on other systems.

       More precisely, the program name passed to the prettyprinter as its
       zeroth argument is filtered by discarding any trailing version number
       and extension, then keeping the last consecutive string of characters
       that are letters, digits, hyphens, or underscores.  If the zeroth
       argument is empty, implying that the program name is unknown, then the
       name htmlpty is used; it is short enough to be acceptable to any
       reasonable file system.

       Automatic association of the style file names with the program name
       makes it easy to support multiple versions, e.g., html-pretty-2-0,
       html-pretty-3-0, html-pretty-3-2, and html-pretty-4-0 could select
       different HTML grammar versions, and on UNIX, and a few other operating
       systems, those programs could all be links to the same physical file,
       avoiding wasteful duplication of disk space.

       In the current implementation of html-pretty, all of the standard HTML
       tags defined in HTML grammar levels up to the proposed 4.0, plus a few
       browser vendor extensions, are hard-coded into the program as members
       of over twenty formatting-style classes, so that no external style
       files need exist for the program to run.  However, the -extend-style,
       -grammar-level, and -stylefile options allow the built-in rules to be
       completely replaced, if desired.

       The -print-stylefile command displays the built-in style rules as a set
       of style class names, each followed by a colon and a list of HTML tags
       in that style class.  Its output may be used without further
       modification as a style file, and looks something like this:

              %% html-pretty version 1.00 date [29-Nov-1997]
              %% User-modifiable style file generated on Wed Dec  3 08:34:39 1997

              %% Uncomment the next line to clear all existing rules,
              %% or leave it as a comment to preserve them:

       There will be additional data at the end of this output, in the form of
       the tag relationships discussed below, but we omit it here because of
       its length.

       Notice that long lines can be continued on multiple physical lines, for
       improved readability, by terminating them with a backslash immediately
       before the newline.  The output line width in this file is governed by
       the -width option.

       As with the command-line -extend-style option, you can replace the
       colon with an equal sign, and the spaces between tags with commas, if
       you prefer.

       In addition to the style classes listed above, the special style class
       default can be used to force an HTML tag to revert to the default rule
       for unknown tags: just treat it as ordinary text, although if the
       -unknown-tag-warning option was specified, a warning will be issued for
       this now unknown tag.  You can use this to override earlier style file
       settings, and most of the built-in ones.

       The special style class public is associated with the SGML DOCTYPE
       identifier string, rather than with a list of HTML tags.  That string
       determines which grammar file is to be used for the document, and the
       value above corresponds to the most generic grammar level (2.0)
       recognized by almost all browsers, even though the style file includes
       tags from higher grammar levels.  The public style class is the only
       class whose value is a quoted string.

       If the tag list to the right of the colon (or equals sign) is empty,
       then all existing tags for that class are forgotten.  If an empty tag
       list is used with the default style class, then all tags for all
       classes are forgotten.  These two uses allow you to eliminate all
       built-in rules, or just certain style classes, so that your style file
       can start from a known rule base.

       Style class names are case sensitive, and all of the ones recognized by
       html-pretty must be spelled with lowercase letters.

       The style file is expected to contain lines of the forms:

              style-class : TAG1 TAG2 ...

              TAG : TAG1 TAG2 ...

              relationship[TAG] : TAG1 TAG2 ...

              -option
              -option -option ...
              -option value
              -option value -option value  ...

       In the second form, the style class of the first tag is looked up and
       assigned to the remaining tags.  That first tag must be entirely
       UPPERCASE in order to distinguish it from a style class.  The remaining
       tag names can be in either lettercase, or in mixed case; they will be
       converted to uppercase internally.

       The third form specifies a relationship between a tag, and one or more
       other tags.  The two currently-recognized relationships are ContainedIn
       and CannotContain; any others that are specified will simply be
       ignored, although they will take up memory space.  For example, the
       lines

              CannotContain[TITLE]      : LINK META SCRIPT STYLE
              ContainedIn[LH]           : DL OL UL

       mean that a TITLE environment cannot contain LINK, META, SCRIPT, or
       STYLE tags, and that an LH tag can only be contained in a DL, OL, or UL
       environment.   Unlike style class definitions, relationships are not
       cumulative; only the last one of each relationship type encountered for
       a particular tag will be used.

       Because of the complexity of SGML grammars, tag relationships cannot be
       reliably determined manually.  Instead, relationship tables are derived
       from the grammar files by software developed especially for, and
       included with, the html-pretty distribution, and then inserted into the
       standard style files.  Thus, it is not anticipated that users will
       provide tag relationship data in their personal style files, although
       they are free to do so.

       The built-in relationship tables are derived from a merger of the major
       grammar levels, so that they match tags in the built-in style classes,
       which are also derived from that merger.

       Tag relationships are only checked when the -check-tag-nesting option
       is specified, and since that is not a default option, omitting tag
       relationships will normally not have a visible effect on the output of
       html-pretty.

       In the remaining forms, command-line options appear, and any of the
       documented options may be used this way.  You can use this facility to
       collect preferred option settings in one place, such as in directory-
       or user-specific initialization files.  Observe that a -stylefile
       option here can be used to chain temporarily to another file, and this
       can go on recursively to a depth which is limited only by the run-time
       stack depth and the maximum number of simultaneously open files.

       Blank lines, leading and trailing whitespace, and text from a percent
       (%) comment character to end of line, are ignored.  To get a literal
       percent or quotation mark into a value, prefix it with a backslash; the
       backslash will be removed when the value is collected.

       Whitespace separates items, and can be omitted around the colon.  There
       is no significance to the order of items on a line, or lines in the
       file, except that later settings can override earlier ones.  The same
       style class name may occur on multiple lines, and the tag lists will be
       accumulated, discarding duplicates.

       The line length limit in style files is system-dependent, but
       guaranteed to be at least 2048 characters.

       Here is an example of a small style file to add the new tags introduced
       in the HTML proposed 4.0 grammar (even though they are actually already
       present in the built-in rules):

              % HTML proposed 4.0 additions
              font : Acronym s

              pair : BdO Button col colgroup Fieldset FrameSet IFrame \
                     laBel NoFrames NoScript Object span TBody TFoot thEAD

              public : "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"

       The last style class attached to command or environment name is the one
       that is used, so specifications in command-line -extend-style,
       -grammar-level, or -stylefile options can override those in the current
       directory style file, those in turn override settings from the home
       directory style file, and those override system-wide style file
       settings.

CATALOG DIRECTORY
       The built-in style rules in html-pretty, together with the three
       default startup style files, and the -extend-style class: taglist and
       -stylefile stylefile options suffice for most uses of the
       prettyprinter.

       However, it may be useful to offer a simpler interface that only
       requires the user to specify the desired grammar level with the
       -grammar-level grammar option, and have html-pretty automatically find
       the style files.  Thus, when the -grammar-level option is used,
       html-pretty looks for a catalog directory that contains a file named
       catalog, and one or more style files.

       The catalog directory is searched for in the same path as the
       executable file, but in a path starting one level higher.  On UNIX, it
       is usually called share/lib/<programname>, so if the executable program
       was /usr/local/bin/html-pretty, the catalog directory is
       /usr/local/share/lib/html-pretty.  [Conventionally, on UNIX systems,
       directories in the share directory tree are shared across multiple O/S
       releases and vendor architectures.]

       On other operating systems, the share portion of the path may be
       omitted.  However, the quickest way to find out where the catalog
       directory resides on your system is to run html-pretty with the
       -grammar-level and -trace-opens options, to trace the file-opening
       attempts.

       The catalog file has a simple format: each non-empty line contains a
       grammar level, and a corresponding filename in that directory.  As with
       style files, comments run from percent (%) to end-of-line, but there is
       no support for line continuation, since the lines are all very short.
       To get a literal percent or quotation mark into a value, prefix it with
       a backslash; the backslash will be removed when the value is collected.

       This indirect mapping of grammar level to style file means that end
       users need not know the style file names, and thus, that the names can
       be changed to meet local requirements.

       SGML parsers and other SGML software use a similar catalog file to map
       DTD descriptor strings to local filenames.

       Lettercase is not significant in grammar-level names, although it may
       be for filenames.  The standard style files are all named in a single
       lettercase, so that the catalog entries work on all file systems.

       If you are developing a new set of styles, you probably do not want
       them put in the system-wide catalog directory until they have been
       completed and debugged. In such a case, you can use the -catalogfile
       option to specify an alternate catalog file location.  Once they are
       ready for wider release, you (or your system manager) can merge your
       catalog file with the system one, and copy your style files into the
       system catalog directory.

COMMENTS IN HTML AND SGML
       The SGML (and thus, HTML) comment syntax confuses many users, including
       browser programmers, and book writers, who either get it wrong, or fail
       to explain it properly.

       SGML has a command called markup declaration open, or mdo for short,
       which defaults to the two-character sequence <!, and is matched by a
       markup declaration close, or mdc, which defaults to the one-character
       sequence >.  The mdo must be immediately followed either by a keyword,
       such as ATTLIST, DOCTYPE, ELEMENT, ENTITY, NOTATION, SGML, SHORTREF, or
       USEMAP, or else by a comment start, which is the two-character sequence
       --.  In the latter case, there must later be a second -- pair to signal
       a comment end.  Anything after that second pair is non-comment text to
       be parsed.  However, additional comments can appear, provided that they
       are surrounded by -- pairs. Eventually, the markup declaration is ended
       by an mdc command, although whitespace may follow the last comment.
       Thus,

              <!--one-- --two-- --three-->
              <!-- one -- -- two -- -- three -- >
              <!-- one --
                -- two --
                -- three --
              >

       are all legal markup declarations, each of which consists of three
       comments. However, these are in error:

              <! --one-- --two-- --three-- >
              <!-- one -- two -- three -- >
              <!--
                       one --
                    -- two --
                    - - three - -
              >

       The first has an illegal space after the mdo, the second has the word
       two outside a comment, and the third has the text - - three - - outside
       the comment.

       Given these rules, can SGML comments be nested?  It might appear that
       they can, since

              <!-- <!-- --> -->
              <!-- <!-- --> <!-- --> -->

       are both accepted by an SGML parser.  However, the nesting is illusory,
       since the first has two comments, containing the text <! and >, and the
       third has three comments: <! and > <! and >.  As soon as we put words
       between the hyphen pairs, such as

              <!-- one <!-- two --> three -->
              <!-- one <!-- two --> <!-- three --> four -->

       the word two lies outside the comment in the first, and two and three
       are outside the comment in the second.  Therefore, SGML and HTML
       comments cannot in general be nested.

       Finally, because of the special significance of -- as both a comment
       start and a comment end inside a markup declaration, you must be
       careful about using adjacent hyphens in the comment text.  In
       particular, if you use a line of hyphens to set off one block of text
       from another, the number of hyphens must be a multiple of 4, such as
       this 60-hyphen example:

              <!------------------------------------------------------------>

       Having 57, 58, 59, 61, 62, or 63 hyphens won't do!

       html-pretty does not distinguish markup declarations, beginning with
       <!, from tags, beginning with <, except for comments, which have to be
       parsed separately anyway to handle the pairs-of-pairs-of-hyphens
       balance requirement.  Thus, it considers !DOCTYPE to be a tag name,
       when strictly speaking, the !  is part of the markup declaration open.
       However, since the closing character > can always be represented by an
       SGML entity, &lt;, html-pretty can safely assume that anything between
       angle brackets is a `tag'.  That is why the style files have a rule

              doctype :            !DOCTYPE

       with the exclamation mark prefixed to the word DOCTYPE.

HTML GRAMMAR CONSTRAINTS
       It is not immediately obvious from the HTML grammars just which tags
       can be contained in, or by, other tag environments.  The list below was
       automatically extracted from the HTML grammar files by software
       developed especially for, and included with, the html-pretty
       distribution.

       The grammar rules for some environments explicitly forbid certain tags
       from appearing in those environments; this is indicated in the lists
       below by the prefix cannot contain:.

       Because the HTML definition is evolving, many tags are defined only in
       certain grammar files. In such a case, the grammar level is indicated
       by a suffix with a colon and a sorted list of one or more levels: 2, 3,
       3.2, 4C (4-Cougar), 4L (4-loose), and M (Mosaic and Netscape).  [The
       level 4-strict from July and November, 1997, is excluded because the
       grammar file omits many heavily-used tags, in anticipation that their
       features will be provided by style sheets.]

       Although there are other HTML grammar versions, these are the major
       ones that are important for current browsers.  If no grammar level list
       is present, then the tag is available in all of the levels listed at
       the start of this paragraph.

       The `tag' #PCDATA means parsed character data, an SGML term for text of
       zero or more ordinary characters and/or SGML named and numeric
       entities, such as &quot; and &#34;.

       The `tag' ANY is a catch-all that means #PCDATA, or any SGML tag
       defined in the grammar.  It should not be used in SGML grammars, but it
       is present in the Mosaic/Netscape grammar file, html-mcom.dtd.

       The `tag' CDATA means character data, an SGML term for zero or more
       characters that are not further examined, except for the purposes of
       scanning for an end tag.  This corresponds to verbatim text in
       typesetting and word-processing systems.

       The special `tag' EMPTY means that the environment is empty, and
       further, that a matching end tag is forbidden.

       If no end tag is shown in the paragraph heading, then it must be
       omitted in HTML files.

       Unless suffixed by optional, all tags listed in the remainder of this
       section are required.  However, if a grammar level list is attached to
       optional or required, then the tag is defined only in those grammar
       levels.

       Use these lists as a portability guide: if a tag is implemented in only
       specified grammar levels, then documents which use it are more likely
       to be displayed improperly by Web browsers.

              NB: The meaning of this tag is aberrant, in that the closing tag
              is not supposed to be present, even though the grammar says that
              it is optional: the environment instead terminates at end-of-
              file.  Browsers differ in their handling of the end tag: some
              display it as ordinary text, and others terminate the
              environment.

PRETTYPRINTER LIMITATIONS
       Like LaTeX, Lisp, PostScript, and TeX, SGML is an extensible language.
       In particular, at run time, it is possible to redefine the syntax and
       semantics of all lexical elements, including the base character set,
       the characters that may appear in identifiers, and the special
       characters that delimit tags or strings.

       In SGML, this is conventionally done in SGML declaration files for
       syntax definitions, and in DTD files, which are analogous to LaTeX
       style files.  Low-level typesetting commands of the flavor ``select a
       14-point Lucida-BoldItalic font'', ``skip down vertically 6 picas'',
       and ``draw a horizontal rule 3 ems long'' are notably absent.  SGML
       documents are expected to use only high-level markup commands, leaving
       the visual appearance entirely up to the DTD specification, and the
       formatting software.

       Unlike LaTeX and TeX, SGML is not a typesetting system.  It is only a
       grammar for a standard markup language, and it is left to SGML software
       implementors to write DTDs, and to provide for translation of SGML
       documents to specific document formatting, typesetting, or word
       processing systems.  In this respect, SGML is similar to the RTF (Rich
       Text Format) supported by many popular word processors, in that it can
       serve as an intermediate language for electronic document exchange;
       several language translators between SGML and other text
       representations are mentioned in the SEE ALSO section below.
       Regrettably, there is wide variation in the capabilities and document
       models of current text formatting systems, so such translations are
       usually rough approximations that may require substantial hand patching
       to make them truly satisfactory.

       HTML is a modest subset of SGML, with tag names apparently chosen from
       SGML, the Free Software Foundation's TeXinfo system (which in turn is
       modeled on the earlier Scribe document formatting system), and
       occasionally, also from LaTeX.

       html-pretty is written in this spirit: it knows about the meaning and
       typical use of all standard HTML tags, but nothing about other SGML
       DTDs.  However, the style-file facility makes it possible to prepare
       formatting rules for any SGML DTD, extending the applicability of
       html-pretty to the entire world of SGML, provided a tag normalizer such
       as sgmlnorm(1) or spam(1) is available to supply omitted tags, and
       expand abbreviated ones.  However, since SGML tag names depend on the
       specific DTD, and DTDs tend to be proprietary, html-pretty is not
       packaged with pre-written style files for SGML.

       Contributions of suitable style files for public SGML DTDs, together
       with those DTDs, are hereby solicited, and they may be included in
       future releases of html-pretty.

PRETTYPRINTER IMPLEMENTATION LIMITS
       As with most computer software, there are certain limitations in
       html-pretty on object sizes, imposed by fixed array dimensions or
       addressing limits of the computer hardware and operating system.  Here
       are the minimum values that all html-pretty implementations must
       provide in order to conform to this documentation; implementations on
       some systems may have much more generous limits.

              2048 characters in single words, tag names, and filenames (this
              must be at least as large as the LITLEN limit set in the SGML
              parser declaration file html.decl);

              100 levels of list and environment nesting (this must be at
              least as large as the TAGLVL limit set in the SGML parser
              declaration file html.decl);

              6 simultaneously open files (stdin, stderr, and stdout, plus the
              style catalog file, and two style files, allowing at least two
              levels of style file nesting).

       These are ample for any realistic document: they support the longest
       legal file paths in all major current operating systems, World-Wide Web
       URLs, and HTML tags named after 58-letter Welsh towns like
       Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch, yet will
       still work on the smallest personal computer operating systems.

       There is no limit on the size of input or output files and lines, other
       than that imposed by physical storage limits of the host file system
       and the computer address space.
