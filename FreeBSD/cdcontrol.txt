CDCONTROL(1)            FreeBSD General Commands Manual           CDCONTROL(1)

NAME
     cdcontrol – compact disc control utility

SYNOPSIS
     cdcontrol [-sv] [-f device] [command ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The cdcontrol utility is a program to control audio features of a CD
     drive.  The device is a name such as cd0.

     If no command is given, then cdcontrol enters an interactive mode,
     reading commands from the standard input.

     The following options are available:

     -s      Silent mode.  Do not print table headers and human readable
             comments.

     -v      Verbose mode.  Print as much information as possible.

     -f device
             Specify a device, such as /dev/cd0.  Both absolute path and
             relative to /dev filename are possible.  The -f option overrides
             CDROM.  If neither CDROM nor the -f option is specified,
             cdcontrol tries opening first /dev/cdrom, then /dev/cd0.

     The available commands are listed below.  Only as many characters as are
     required to uniquely identify a command need be specified.  The word play
     can be omitted or the characters + and - can be used in the place of next
     and prev.
