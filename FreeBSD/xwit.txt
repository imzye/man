DESCRIPTION
       xwit is an X window interface tool.  By default when used with no
       arguments in an xterm it de-iconifies and raises the window.  You can
       specify a different function to do, such as iconifying the window, and
       apply it to several windows whose name begins with one of the given
       strings, or a particular window id given, or the window id found in the
       environment variable WINDOWID (which is set by xterm for the program it
       runs), or the window under the mouse cursor.

OPTIONS
       -display
              is followed by the display to open.

       -sync  causes all X requests to be performed synchronously.

       -property property
              causes the specified property to be used instead of the windows
              name (which is WM_NAME).  Some possible values are: WM_CLASS,
              WM_COMMAND, WM_ICON_NAME, WM_CLIENT_MACHINE.

       -pop   is the default action.  It need only be given if it is wanted as
              well as some other function.

       -focus will give the input focus to the specified window.

       -iconify
              will iconify the windows instead of popping them.

       -unmap will iconify windows by unmapping with a non ICCCM compliant
              window manager.  (Beware, this option is not usually what you
              want).

       -raise raise windows (but do not map them if unmapped).

       -lower lower windows.

       -opposite
              toggle the stacking of windows from top to bottom among any
              overlapping windows.

       -circulate
              circulate a window's subwindows forward. Use this with -root.

       -uncirculate
              circulate a window's subwindows backward. Use this with -root.

       -resize w h
              resize windows to the given pixel size.

       -rows r
              resize windows to the given number of rows.

       -columns c
              resize windows to the given number of columns.

       -move x y
              move windows to the given absolute position relative to its
              parent.  (If the x or y value is negative it is taken relative
              to the right or bottom edge of the parent.)

       -rmove x y
              move windows by the given relative amount.

       -warp x y
              move the cursor to the given position relative to the specified
              window.  Add -root to warp to an absolute position.

       -rwarp x y
              move the cursor by the given relative amount.

       -colormap colormapid
              install the given colormap into the given window.  -save -nosave
              immediately enable or disable the screen saver.

       -name name
              set the WM_NAME property to the given string.

       -iconname name
              set the WM_ICON_NAME property to the given string.

       -bitmap file
              use the given bitmap file as the icon bitmap for the window.

       -mask file
              use the given bitmap file as the icon mask for the window.

       -iconmove x y
              move icons to the given absolute position.  (Will not work with
              some window managers.)

       -riconmove x y
              move icons by the given relative amount.  (Will not work with
              some window managers.)

       -backingstore -bs -nobackingstore -nobs
              enable or disable backing store for the window.

       -saveunder -su -nosaveunder -nosu
              enable or disable saveunders for the window.

       -keyrepeat -nokeyrepeat
              is followed by a list of keycodes (decimal numbers, see
              xmodmap(1)).  A range can be specified as a lower number, ``-'',
              and upper number as three separate arguments.  The individual
              setting of auto-repeat for those keycodes is set on or off.  The
              global setting of auto-repeat can be set with xset(1).  When
              off, no keys will repeat.

       -print will print the id, the coordinates, the depth and the name of
              all selected windows.  If -property is given, that one will be
              printed instead of the name.

       Window Selection
              If no window is specified, $WINDOWID will be used if set;
              otherwise the window under the cursor will be selected.

       -id    is followed by a single window number, in decimal; or, if it
              begins with 0x, in hexadecimal.

       -root  selects the root window.

       -current
              selects the window under the cursor (default if no window
              specified and $WINDOWID not set).

       -select
              allows the user to interactively select a window with the mouse.

       -all   is equivalent to -names '', as easier to remember.

       -names if given must be the last option and is followed by a list of
              strings.  All windows that have a name that begins exactly like
              one of the strings will be acted upon.  If -property is given,
              this property is used instead of the name.  By using a null
              string (-names ''), all names will be matched.

EXAMPLES
       To de-iconify and pop ``this'' xterm and warp the cursor into it:

                 xwit -pop -warp 50 50

       To interactively select an xterm, and resize it to 34 rows and 80
       columns:

                 xwit -select -rows 34 -columns 80

       To gently agitate your oclock on the screen:

                 while   xwit -rmove 0 10 -names oclock
                 do      xwit -rmove 0 -10 -names oclock
                 done

DIAGNOSTICS
       Exit status is 0 if any action is taken, 1 if no window matches the
       list supplied to -names, 2 if an error occurs.

LIMITATIONS
       Since each application is supposed to request these functions of the
       window manager, some of them may not like other clients mapping and
       unmapping them behind their backs.  Iconification is requested of the
       window manager using the ICCCM.  Non ICCCM compliant window managers
       may not react correctly.
