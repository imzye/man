NAME
       Perl::PrereqScanner::Lite - Lightweight Prereqs Scanner for Perl

SYNOPSIS
           use Perl::PrereqScanner::Lite;

           my $scanner = Perl::PrereqScanner::Lite->new;
           $scanner->add_extra_scanner('Moose'); # add extra scanner for moose style
           my $modules = $scanner->scan_file('path/to/file');

DESCRIPTION
       Perl::PrereqScanner::Lite is the lightweight prereqs scanner for perl.
       This scanner uses Compiler::Lexer as tokenizer, therefore processing
       speed is really fast.

METHODS
   new($opt)
       Create a scanner instance.

       $opt must be hash reference. It accepts following keys of hash:

       •   extra_scanners

           It specifies extra scanners. This item must be array reference.

           e.g.

               my $scanner = Perl::PrereqScanner::Lite->new(
                   extra_scanners => [qw/Moose Version/]
               );

           See also "add_extra_scanner($scanner_name)".

       •   no_prereq

           It specifies to use "## no prereq" or not. Please see also
           "ADDITIONAL NOTATION".

   scan_file($file_path)
       Scan and figure out prereqs which is instance of
       "CPAN::Meta::Requirements" by file path.

   scan_string($string)
       Scan and figure out prereqs which is instance of
       "CPAN::Meta::Requirements" by source code string written in perl.

       e.g.

           open my $fh, '<', __FILE__;
           my $string = do { local $/; <$fh> };
           my $modules = $scanner->scan_string($string);

   scan_module($module_name)
       Scan and figure out prereqs which is instance of
       "CPAN::Meta::Requirements" by module name.

       e.g.

           my $modules = $scanner->scan_module('Perl::PrereqScanner::Lite');

   scan_tokens($tokens)
       Scan and figure out prereqs which is instance of
       "CPAN::Meta::Requirements" by tokens of Compiler::Lexer.

       e.g.

           open my $fh, '<', __FILE__;
           my $string = do { local $/; <$fh> };
           my $tokens = Compiler::Lexer->new->tokenize($string);
           my $modules = $scanner->scan_tokens($tokens);

   add_extra_scanner($scanner_name)
       Add extra scanner to scan and figure out prereqs. This module loads
       extra scanner such as
       "Perl::PrereqScanner::Lite::Scanner::$scanner_name" if specifying
       scanner name through this method.

       If you want to specify an extra scanner from external package without
       "Perl::PrereqScanner::Lite::" prefix, you can prepend "+" to
       $scanner_name. Like so "+Your::Awesome::Scanner".

       Extra scanners that are default supported are followings;

       •       Perl::PrereqScanner::Lite::Scanner::Moose

       •       Perl::PrereqScanner::Lite::Scanner::Version

ADDITIONAL NOTATION
       If "no_prereq" is enabled by new() (like so:
       "Perl::PrereqScanner::Lite->new({no_prereq => 1})"), this module
       recognize "## no prereq" optional comment. The requiring declaration
       with this comment on the same line will be ignored as prereq.

       For example

           use Foo;
           use Bar; ## no prereq

       In this case "Foo" is the prereq, however "Bar" is ignored.

NOTES
       This is a quotation from
       <https://github.com/moznion/Perl-PrereqScanner-Lite/issues/13>.

       Yes, it's true. This design is so ugly and not smart.  So I have to
       redesign and reimplement this module, and I have some plans.

       If you have a mind to expand this module by implementing external
       scanner, please be careful.  Every "scan_*" calls must not affect to
       any others through the singleton of this module (called it $c in
       <https://github.com/moznion/Perl-PrereqScanner-Lite/blob/c03638b2e2a39d92f4d7df360af5a6be65dc417a/lib/Perl/PrereqScanner/Lite/Scanner/Moose.pm#L8>).
