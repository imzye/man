Balsa(1)                            2.6.5""                           Balsa(1)

NAME
       Balsa - the GNOME e-mail client.

DESCRIPTION
       You can use Balsa to fetch, read, write and send e-mails.

       It supports
         * local mailboxes in maildir, mbox and/or mh format,
         * nested mailboxes,
         * protocols POP3, IMAP and SMTP,
         * multithreaded mail retrieval,
         * GnuPG/GPG encryption, LDAP, Kerberos and SSL,
         * MIME (view images, save parts),
         * multiple character sets,
         * vCard, GPE, and other address book formats,
         * printing and spell-checking.

       Balsa is an integral part of the GNOME desktop environment, but it can
       also be used standalone though it may print some error messages then.

       For help on using Balsa, see the documentation in its help menu using
       the Yelp Gnome help/documentation browser.

       This man page tells about the options of the 'balsa' command, which is
       used to start Balsa.

       Most of these options let you tell Balsa that when it starts it should
       immediately open a mailbox, or the composer, and things like that.

       When you start Balsa from the command line, not only can you use the
       command line options described below, any error messages are printed to
       that terminal too (whether you execute that command in the background
       or not).

SYNTAX
       balsa [  -h | --help                               ]       [  -v |
       --version                            ]       [  -c | --check-mail
       ]       [  -i | --open-inbox                         ]       [( -m |
       --compose=)email-address             ]       [( -a | --attach=)filename
       ]       [( -o | --open-mailbox=)mailbox[:mailbox]... ]       [  -u |
       --open-unread-mailbox                ]       [  -s | --get-stats
       ]

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Displays a message describing command line syntax of Balsa,
              giving many more options than are presented in this man page;
              Balsa exits immediately after that.

       -v, --version
              Balsa prints its version and exits.

       -c, --check-mail
              Balsa starts and checks for new mail immediately.

       -i, --open-inbox
              Balsa starts and opens the Inbox.

       -m email-address, --compose=email-address
              When invoked with this option, Balsa will open its email-
              composer for a new message with the specified address in the To:
              field.

              The email-address parameter can be specified as user@host, e.g.
              balsa-list@gnome.org, or in URL format, e.g. "Balsa List <balsa-
              list@gnome.org>".

              Balsa also serves as the mailto protocol handler.

       -a FILENAME, --attach=FILENAME
              When invoked with this option, Balsa will open its email-
              composer for a new message with the specified file already
              attached to the message.

              Example : balsa -a ~/balsa-new.1.gz

       -o MAILBOX, --open-mailbox=MAILBOX...
              This makes Balsa start and open the specified mailbox.  The
              mailbox should be specified by its full URL.

              Example : balsa -o imap://user@mail.example.com/INBOX balsa -o
              file:///var/mail/user

       -u, --open-unread-mailbox
              Open all mailboxes that may contain unread messages.

       -s, --get-stats
              Balsa prints the numbers of unread and unsent messages and
              exits.
