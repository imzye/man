Statistics::ChiSquare(3)                   User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       "Statistics::ChiSquare" - How well-distributed is your data?

SYNOPSIS
           use Statistics::ChiSquare;

           print chisquare(@array_of_numbers);

       Statistics::ChiSquare is available at a CPAN site near you.

DESCRIPTION
       Suppose you flip a coin 100 times, and it turns up heads 70 times.  Is
       the coin fair?

       Suppose you roll a die 100 times, and it shows 30 sixes.  Is the die
       loaded?

       In statistics, the chi-square test calculates how well a series of
       numbers fits a distribution.  In this module, we only test for whether
       results fit an even distribution.  It doesn't simply say "yes" or "no".
       Instead, it gives you a confidence interval, which sets upper and lower
       bounds on the likelihood that the variation in your data is due to
       chance.  See the examples below.

       If you've ever studied elementary genetics, you've probably heard about
       Gregor Mendel.  He was a wacky Austrian botanist who discovered (in
       1865) that traits could be inherited in a predictable fashion.  He did
       lots of experiments with cross breeding peas: green peas, yellow peas,
       smooth peas, wrinkled peas.  A veritable Brave New World of legumes.

       But Mendel faked his data.  A statistician by the name of R. A. Fisher
       used the chi-square test to prove it.

FUNCTIONS
   chisquare
       There's just one function in this module: chisquare().  Instead of
       returning the bounds on the confidence interval in a tidy little two-
       element array, it returns an English string.  This was a deliberate
       design choice---many people misinterpret chi-square results, and the
       string helps clarify the meaning.

       The string returned by chisquare() will always match one of these
       patterns:

         ".*!" (ie strings ending in an exclamation)

       various error messages for when you supply Obviously Wrong data.

         "There's a >\d+% chance, and a <\d+% chance, that this data is random."

       or

         "There's a <\d+% chance that this data is random."

       or

         "I can't handle \d+ choices without a better table."

       That last one deserves a bit more explanation.  The "modern" chi-square
       test uses a table of values (based on Pearson's approximation) to avoid
       expensive calculations.  Thanks to the table, the chisquare()
       calculation is very fast, but there are some collections of data it
       can't handle, including any collection with more than 250 slots.  So
       you can't calculate the randomness of a 500-sided die should such an
       insane thing ever exist.

       You will also notice that the percentage points that have been
       tabulated for different numbers of data points - that is, for different
       degrees of freedom - differ.  The table in Jon Orwant's original
       version has data tabulated for 100%, 99%, 95%, 90%, 70%, 50%, 30%, 10%,
       5%, and 1% likelihoods.  Data added later by David Cantrell is
       tabulated for 100%, 99%, 95%, 90%, 75%, 50%, 25%, 10%, 5%, and 1%
       likelihoods.

EXAMPLES
       Imagine a coin flipped 1000 times.  The expected outcome is 500 heads
       and 500 tails:

         @coin = (500, 500);
         print chisquare(@coin);

       prints "There's a >90% chance, and a <100% chance, that this data is
       random.

       Imagine a die rolled 60 times that shows sixes just a wee bit too
       often.

         @die1  = (8, 7, 9, 8, 8, 20);
         print chisquare(@die1);

       prints "There's a >1% chance, and a <5% chance, that this data is
       random.

       Imagine a die rolled 600 times that shows sixes way too often.

         @die2  = (80, 70, 90, 80, 80, 200);
         print chisquare(@die2);

       prints "There's a <1% chance that this data is random."

       How random is rand()?

         srand(time ^ $$);
         @rands = ();
         for ($i = 0; $i < 60000; $i++) {
             $slot = int(rand(6));
             $rands[$slot]++;
         }
         print "@rands\n";
         print chisquare(@rands);

       prints (on my machine)

         10156 10041 9991 9868 10034 9910
         There's a >10% chance, and a <50% chance, that this data is random.

       So much for pseudorandom number generation.
