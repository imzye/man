Tie::DB_File::SplitHash(3)                 User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Tie::DB_File::SplitHash - Divides a DB_File hash across multiple files

SYNOPSIS
          use Tie::DB_File::SplitHash;

          [$X =] tie %hash,  'Tie::DB_File::SplitHash', $filename, $flags, $mode, $DB_HASH, $multi_n;

          $status = $X->del($key [, $flags]) ;
          $status = $X->put($key, $value [, $flags]) ;
          $status = $X->get($key, $value [, $flags]) ;
          $status = $X->seq($key, $value, $flags) ;
          $status = $X->sync([$flags]) ;
          $status = $X->fd ;

          $hash{'this'} = 'that';
          my $entry     = $hash{'this'};

          undef $X;  # See the 'untie() Gotcha' in the DB_File documentation
          untie %hash;

       $multi_n determines the 'spread out' or number of files the hash will
       be split between. The larger the number, the larger the final hash can
       be.

       The other parameters are as defined in DB_File.

DESCRIPTION
       Transparently splits a Berkeley DB_File database into multiple files to
       allow the exceeding of file system limits on file size. From the
       outside, it behaves identically with Berkeley DB DB_File hash support
       in general with the exception of 'seq' in object oriented mode. This
       has the potential to greatly expand the amount of data that can be
       stored on a file size limited file system.

       It does so by taking a hash of the key to be stored, folding the
       resulting hash into a value from 0 to X and storing the data to a db
       file selected by the value 0 to X. The randomizing behavior of the hash
       and subsequent fold down distribute the records essentially randomly
       between the X+1 database files, raising the capacity of the database to
       X+1 times the capacity of a single file database on the average.

       In other words: If your filesystem is limited to (for example) 2
       gigabyte files, but you need to store more than that much data in a
       Berkeley hash, you can use this module to efficiently do so.

       NOTE: Using an 'in-memory' database is not supported by this.  Use
       DB_File directly if you want to do that.

       BTREE and RECNO databases are not supported by this module either.

       The module by default exports the following constants and variables
       from DB_File (see DB_File for full details on what they are for):

        $DB_HASH       DB_LOCK         DB_SHMEM        DB_TXN      HASHMAGIC
        HASHVERSION    MAX_PAGE_NUMBER MAX_PAGE_OFFSET MAX_REC_NUMBER
        RET_ERROR      RET_SPECIAL     RET_SUCCESS     R_CURSOR
        R_DUP          R_FIRST         R_FIXEDLEN      R_IAFTER
        R_IBEFORE      R_LAST          R_NEXT          R_NOKEY
        R_NOOVERWRITE  R_PREV          R_RECNOSYNC     R_SETCURSOR
        R_SNAPSHOT __R_UNUSED

       We also export the Fcntl O_xxxx constants.

       You can suppress those exports by 'use'ing the module with an empty
       parameter list:

         use Tie::DB_File::SplitHash ();

       For documentation on the methods and features of a DB_File hash - see
       the documentation for DB_File. This module is essentially a wrapper
       around DB_File that layers on the additional functionality of using
       multiple files to store the data.

       WARNING - changing the 'split' factor on an existing database will
       result in data loss. Don't do it.

CHANGES
        1.07 2020.10.04 - Fixes for MSWin directory permissions
                          and file descriptor behavior breaking tests.

        1.06 2020.10.03 - Fixes for temp directory issue in tests (thanks goes
                          to jkeenan [...] cpan.org for identifying the problem
                          and submitting a patch for it). Updated maintainer info.
                          Updated build support. Relicensed under MIT license.

        1.05 2005.11.18 - Added version requirement for Pod::Coverage to tests

        1.04 2005.10.03 - Fixed build test failures under MSWindows.
                          Merged db creation tests with newer tests.

        1.03 2005.09.29 - Fixed build test failure caused by root being able
                          to create directories and files even in 'forbidden'
                          directories. No functional changes.

        1.02 2005.09.27 - Added Build.PL support, META.yml and Changes. Revised
                          documentation. Extended build test coverage to 100%
                          code coverage. Removed unneeded usage of 'Tie::Hash'.
                          Fixed bug in NEXTKEY causing CLEAR to throw errors.
                          Added LICENSES, GPL_License.txt and
                          Artistic_License.txt.

        1.01 2000.03.06 - Removed 'dependencies' on built-ins that caused
                          'make' failures and added install tests.

METHODS
       The object methods only apply if you are using the object oriented
       interface instead of the tied hash interface. There is the significant
       limitation that 'seq' does not work correctly in a split database.

       $status = $X->get($key, $value [, $flags]) ;
           See DB_File.

       $status = $X->put($key, $value [, $flags]);
           See DB_File.

       $status = $X->del($key [, $flags]);
           See DB_File.

       $status = $X->fd;
           See DB_File. Note - since multiple databases are actually open,
           only the file descriptor for the '1st' underlaying database is
           returned.

       $status = $X->seq($key, $value, $flags);
           'seq' DOES NOT WORK. DO NOT USE IT. This DB_File method is
           difficult to make work correctly in a split database.

       $status = $X->sync([$flags]);
           See DB_File.

       $result = $X->exists($key);
           Returns true if the specified key exists in the database.

       $result = $X->clear;
           Clears (removes all keys and values) the entire hash.
