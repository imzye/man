NAME
       Digest::Pearson::PurePerl - Pure Perl interface to Pearson hash

SYNOPSIS
         use Digest::Pearson::PurePerl qw(pearson);

         my $hash = pearson("abcdef012345");  # 0 <= $hash < 256

DESCRIPTION
       Digest::Pearson::PurePerl is an implementation of Peter K. Pearson's
       hash algorithm presented in "Fast Hashing of Variable Length Text
       Strings" - ACM 1990.  This hashing technique yields good distribution
       of hashed results for variable length input strings on the range 0-255,
       and thus, it is well suited for data load balancing.

       If you prefer a fast implementation, you might want to consider
       Digest::Pearson instead.

       This module does not export anything by default. To use this hash
       function, do either of the following.

       use Digest::Pearson qw(pearson);

       Digest::Pearson::pearson($string)

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
       The implementation is derived from RFC 3074 - DHC Load Balancing
       Algorithm.
