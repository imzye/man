NAME
       surf - simple webkit-based browser

SYNOPSIS
       surf [-bBdDfFgGiIkKmMnNpPsStTvwxX] [-a cookiepolicies] [-c cookiefile]
       [-C stylefile] [-e xid] [-r scriptfile] [-u useragent] [-z zoomlevel]
       [URI]

DESCRIPTION
       surf is a simple Web browser based on WebKit/GTK+. It is able to
       display websites and follow links. It supports the XEmbed protocol
       which makes it possible to embed it in another application.
       Furthermore, one can point surf to another URI by setting its
       XProperties.

OPTIONS
       -a cookiepolicies
              Define the order of cookie policies.  The default is "@Aa" but
              could be redefined in the config.h, with "A" meaning to accept
              all cookies, "a" to deny all cookies and "@", which tells surf
              to accept no third party cookies.

       -b     Disable Scrollbars.

       -B     Enable Scrollbars.

       -c cookiefile
              Specify the cookiefile to use.

       -C stylefile
              Specify the user stylefile.  This does disable the site-specific
              styles.

       -d     Disable the disk cache.

       -D     Enable the disk cache.

       -e xid Reparents to window specified by xid.

       -t     Disable strict TLS check.

       -T     Enable strict TLS check.

       -u useragent
              Specify the useragent which surf should use.

       -v     Prints version information to standard output, then exits.

       -w     Prints xid to standard output. This can be used to script the
              browser in for example xdotool(1).

       -x     Disable custom certificates.

       -X     Enable custom certificates.
