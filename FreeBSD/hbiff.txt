       hbiff*newMailRaise:           on
       hbiff*foreground:             navy
       hbiff*background:             wheat
       hbiff*fontName:               6x10

       hbiff*newMailForeground:      white

       hbiff*newMailBeep:            on


       The utility hbiff indicates the current state of an electronic mailbox.
       The default mailbox is /usr/mail/$LOGNAME, but an alternate file may be
       indicated by using the -m option.

       New mail is indicated by a raised flag and mail hanging out of the
       mailbox, and may be accompanied by the window changing color if desired
       by the user.  Old mail is indicated by mail hanging out of the mailbox
       with no flag raised, while no mail is indicated by an empty mailbox.
       If the -tally option is used (or the *tally resource is on), the total
       number of messages in the mailbox will be displayed, and the number of
       new messages will be displayed when new mail is detected.

       To exit hbiff, press shift right button, or type "q" with the cursor in
       the window.  To get the mail command, press the right mouse button.
       Pressing button2 (the middle button) will cause a window with the
       "From" and "subject" line of each mail message to appear.  During the
       time the "From" window is visible, if the right mouse button is pressed
       on the mailbox window, the "From" window will go away and the mail
       command will be executed, all in one action.  Any other keypresses or
       button presses while the "From" window is present will result in the
       "From" window disappearing, no other action will occur.  If the mailbox
       icon indicates new mail, pressing the left mouse button will cause the
       flag to go down (this was requested since some mailers do not use
       separate folders, and it is necessary to drop the flag after deleting
       mail and exiting the mailer).

       The most recent mail message is indicated with a '>' before it.

       Summary information from new mail messages can be automatically
       displayed by using the -sn option or *showNewMail resource.  When new
       mail is detected, hbiff will notify the user and then pop up a summary
       window showing only the mail that has been received since hbiff
       detected that the mailbox was last accessed.

       To turn off window decoration (borders not supplied by the
       application), use the clientDecoration directive in the .Xdefaults file
       (i.e., Mwm*HBiff.clientDecoration: +none).

       For best results when running a command executed by hbiff, use the
       *ttyModes resource for the hpterm or xterm you are using.  This allows
       setting the stty parameters that would otherwise be set by the shell on
       initiation.
