SYNOPSIS
       rovclock [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the rovclock command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the
       original program does not have a manual page.

       rovclock is a program that allow you to control frequency rates of your
       Radeon card.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       -i     Show info of your Radeon card.

       -x N   Manually define xtal frequency to N KHz.
              It tries to detect the reference clock (xtal) from the video
              BIOS, if this doesn't work you can specify it manually with -t.
              Try 1432 or 2950 if the default value of 2700 does not work.

       -c N   Set core clock to N MHz.

       -m N   Set memory clock to N MHz.

       -t name:val
