NAME
       marbles - build figures out of colored marbles

SYNOPSIS
       marbles

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
       because the original program does not have a manual page.

       You goal in the puzzle game marbles is to create a more or less complex
       figure out of single marbles within a time limit to reach the next
       level. Sounds easy? Well, there is a problem: If a marble starts to
       move, it will not stop until it hits a wall or another marble.

OPTIONS
       None.
