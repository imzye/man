NAME
       PlayOnBSD - front-end for Wine


SYNOPSIS
       playonbsd [options]


DESCRIPTION
       PlayOnBSD is a front-end for Wine. It allows you to easily install and
       use numerous games and softwares designed to run with Microsoft®'s
       Windows®.
       Few games are compatible with GNU/BSD at the moment and it certainly is
       a factor preventing the migration to this system.

       PlayOnBSD performs installations in ~/.PlayOnBSD and uses separate Wine
       prefixes to avoid conflicts between applications.


OPTIONS
       --version
               Show version number and exit.

       --run <prog>
               Run directly the specified program.
