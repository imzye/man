GSS_PROCESS_CONTEXT_TOKEN(3)            FreeBSD Library Functions Manual (prm)

NAME
     gss_process_context_token – Process a token on a security context from a
     peer application

SYNOPSIS
     #include <gssapi/gssapi.h>

     OM_uint32
     gss_process_context_token(OM_uint32 *minor_status,
         const gss_ctx_id_t context_handle, const gss_buffer_t token_buffer);

DESCRIPTION
     Provides a way to pass an asynchronous token to the security service.
     Most context-level tokens are emitted and processed synchronously by
     gss_init_sec_context() and gss_accept_sec_context(), and the application
     is informed as to whether further tokens are expected by the
     GSS_C_CONTINUE_NEEDED major status bit.  Occasionally, a mechanism may
     need to emit a context-level token at a point when the peer entity is not
     expecting a token.  For example, the initiator's final call to
     gss_init_sec_context() may emit a token and return a status of
     GSS_S_COMPLETE, but the acceptor's call to gss_accept_sec_context() may
     fail.  The acceptor's mechanism may wish to send a token containing an
     error indication to the initiator, but the initiator is not expecting a
     token at this point, believing that the context is fully established.
     gss_process_context_token() provides a way to pass such a token to the
     mechanism at any time.

PARAMETERS
     minor_status        Mechanism specific status code.

     context_handle      Context handle of context on which token is to be
                         processed.

     token_buffer        Token to process.

RETURN VALUES
     GSS_S_COMPLETE             Successful completion

     GSS_S_DEFECTIVE_TOKEN      Indicates that consistency checks performed on
                                the token failed

     GSS_S_NO_CONTEXT           The context_handle did not refer to a valid
                                context
