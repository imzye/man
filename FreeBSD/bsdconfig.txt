BSDCONFIG(8)            FreeBSD System Manager's Manual           BSDCONFIG(8)

NAME
     bsdconfig – system configuration utility

SYNOPSIS
     bsdconfig [-h]
     bsdconfig command [-h]
     bsdconfig [OPTIONS] [command [OPTIONS]]

DESCRIPTION
     bsdconfig is used to set up many system configuration settings, both for
     new systems, as well as changing configuration settings of existing
     systems.

     bsdconfig optionally takes a command as an argument.  If invoked with no
     arguments, it will bring up an interactive menu listing the available
     modules.

     The following options are available:

     -d       Provide lots of debugging info on standard-out when running.

     -D file  Send debugging info to file.  If file begins with a plus-sign
              debug info is sent to both standard-out and file (minus the
              leading plus).

     -f file  Load file as script and then exit.  If multiple occurrences,
              program will only exit after last occurrence.  If file is a
              single dash (‘-’), bsdconfig reads from standard input.

     -h       Print usage statement and exit.

     -S       Secure X11 mode (implies -X).  As root, always prompt-for and
              validate sudo(8) username/password before starting.

     -X       Use Xdialog(1) in place of dialog(1).

COMMANDS
     The following commands (sorted alphabetically) are currently included in
     the base bsdconfig program, with more to be added soon.  Other commands

INTERNATIONALIZATION
     i18n features are built into bsdconfig and language-specific translation
     files will be added as they become available.  In the absence of
     language-specific translation files, the default (en_US.ISO8859-1) files
     will be used.

ADDING COMMANDS
     To be documented later.  Document menu_selection="command|*" syntax of
     INDEX files.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
     The following environment variables affect the execution of bsdconfig:

     LANG    If LANG is set, messages and index information will be read from
             files named messages.$LANG and INDEX.$LANG and fall back to files
             named messages and INDEX if messages.$LANG and INDEX.$LANG do not
             exist.  LANG takes precedence over LC_ALL.

     LC_ALL  If LC_ALL is set, messages and index information will be read
             from files named messages.$LC_ALL and INDEX.$LC_ALL and fall back
             to files named messages and INDEX if messages.$LC_ALL and
             INDEX.$LC_ALL do not exist.

FILES
     /usr/share/examples/bsdconfig/bsdconfigrc can be copied to
     $HOME/.bsdconfigrc and customized as needed.

EXIT STATUS
     The bsdconfig utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

BUGS
     The docsinstall and diskmgmt modules call bsdinstall.  Bugs found in
     these modules should be considered those of bsdinstall, not bsdconfig.
