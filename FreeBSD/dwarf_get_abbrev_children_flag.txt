DESCRIPTION
     Function dwarf_get_abbrev_children_flag() retrieves a flag indicating
     whether the DWARF debug information entry associated with a DWARF

     returned by dwarf_get_abbrev(3).

     Argument ret should point to a location which will hold the returned
     flag.  The value returned will be one of the following:
     DW_CHILDREN_yes      The debugging information entry associated with the
                          specified abbreviation descriptor has children.
     DW_CHILDREN_no       The debugging information entry associated with the
                          specified abbreviation descriptor has no children.

     If argument err is not NULL, it will be used to store error information
     in case of an error.

RETURN VALUES
     Function dwarf_get_abbrev_children_flag() returns DW_DLV_OK when it
     succeeds.  In case of an error, it returns DW_DLV_ERROR and sets the
     argument err.

ERRORS

     [DW_DLE_ARGUMENT]       Either of arguments abbrev or ret was NULL.
