NAME
       dzil - do stuff with your dist

VERSION
       version 6.033

OVERVIEW
       For help with Dist::Zilla, start with <https://dzil.org/> or by running
       "dzil commands".

PERL VERSION
       This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates
       from the Perl 5 Porters.  This means it should work on any version of
       perl released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the most
       recently released version is v5.40, then this module should work on
       both v5.40 and v5.38.)

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made
       that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version
       may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.
