NAME
       Call::Context - Sanity-check calling context

SYNOPSIS
           use Call::Context;

           sub gives_a_list {

               #Will die() if the context is not list.
               Call::Context::must_be_list();

               return (1, 2, 3);
           }

           gives_a_list();             #die()s: incorrect context (void)

           my $v = gives_a_list();     #die()s: incorrect context (scalar)

           my @list = gives_a_list();  #lives

DISCUSSION
       If your function only expects to return a list, then a call in some
       other context is, by definition, an error. The problem is that,
       depending on how the function is written, it may actually do something
       expected in testing, but then in production act differently.

FUNCTIONS
   must_be_list()
       die()s if the calling function is itself called outside list context.
       (See the SYNOPSIS for examples.)

EXCEPTIONS
       This module throws instances of "Call::Context::X". "Call::Context::X"
       is overloaded to stringify; however, to keep memory usage low,
       "overload" is not loaded until instantiation.
