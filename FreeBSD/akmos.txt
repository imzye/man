NAME
       akmos - sets of cryptography utils

SYNOPSIS
       akmos {action} [options]

DESCRIPTION
       The akmos utility is used for encryption/decryption files and streams,
       compute message digests and other.

       Here is the list of available actions:

       dgst
           calculate message digests

       enc, dec
           symmetric ciphering

       mac
           compute message authentication code

       base64
           binary to text encoding

SYMMETRIC CIPHERING

       akmos enc|dec [-a algo[:flag]] [-m mode] [-k keyfile] [-l keylen]
                     [-p | -P passfile] [-y] [-V] [-h] {input} {output}

   Options
       -a algo[:flag]
           Crypto algorithm to use. By default is Twofish

           Supported FLAGS

           :ede flag put cipher into Encrypt-Decrypt-Encrypt mode (like 3DES)

           :eee flag put cipher into Encrypt-Encrypt-Encrypt mode

           NOTE: TDEA not available with stream ciphers

       -m mode
           Crypto mode to use. By default is CBC for block ciphers, and CTR
           for stream ciphers.

       -k keyfile
           Specifies a file which contains the keyfile

           NOTE: size of keyfile is limited by 1 MiB

       -p
           Use a passphrase as a component of the keyfile

       -P passfile
           Read passphrase from a file

       -l keylen
           Key length (in bits) to use with the given crypto algorithm. By
           default is 128 bits

       -y
           Overwrite output file without promt
