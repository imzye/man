NAME
       Text::AsciiTeX - Convert (La)TeX formulas to ASCII art

SYNOPSIS
        use Text::AsciiArt;

        #equivalent examples

        my @text_array = render('\frac{1}{e}');
        print "$_\n" for @text_array;

        my $text_array = render('\frac{1}{e}');
        print $text_array;

        print scalar render('\frac{1}{e}');

        render('\frac{1}{e}');

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a mechanism to render (La)TeX formulae to ASCII
       art. It is based solely on AsciiTeX written by Bart Pieters (See
       "UNDERLYING TECHNOLOGIES").

EXPORTED FUNCTION
       This module exports the "render" function.

   "render( $latex [, $columns] )"
       Argument(s)

       The function "render" accepts a string containing a formula in (La)TeX
       formatting. Optionally, an integer may be given to specify the number
       of columns for the output or zero for no-breaking. The default number
       of columns is 80.

       Return

       Since version 0.03 the return value is context aware.

       •   In list context, "render" returns a list whose elements are
           strings, one for each row of the art. Printing each line,
           terminated by a newline will probably do what you expect.

       •   In scalar context, "render" will return a string of the
           concatenated lines, each ended with a newline.

       •   In void context, "render" will print the scalar context return
           directly to the "select"ed file handle (usually "STDOUT").

EXAMPLES
       For use examples see "SYNOPSIS". For a list of allowed syntax and
       syntax examples read Text::AsciiTeX::Syntax.

UNDERLYING TECHNOLOGIES
       This module is basically just a C-level Perl wrapper of AsciiTeX
       written by Bart Pieters. That project is hosted at
       <http://asciitex.sourceforge.net/>. AsciiTeX in turn was a fork of
       eqascii which was written by Przemek Borys. This module owes a debt of
       thanks to both authors.
