NAME
       CommitBit - A project administration tool

DESCRIPTION
       CommitBit is a tool for managing commit access to software projects.
       It also provides for a "code.yourorganization.org" site with links to
       your wiki, mailing lists, bug tracking and so on.

       The project is in the early stages of development and could desperately
       use some help. If you're interested, please write to
       jesse@bestpractical.com and ask for a commit bit.
