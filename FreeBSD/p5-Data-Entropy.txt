NAME
       Data::Entropy - entropy (randomness) management

SYNOPSIS
               use Data::Entropy qw(entropy_source);

               $i = entropy_source->get_int(12345);

               use Data::Entropy qw(with_entropy_source);

               with_entropy_source $source, sub {
                       @a = shuffle(@a);
               };

STATUS
       This module is deprecated.

       For most purposes (including cryptography and security), modules like
       Crypt::URandom, Crypt::SysRandom or Crypt::PRNG are more than adequate.

       Modern operating systems provide good sources of random bytes, and the
       above mentioned modules work on many kinds of systems, including
       Windows.

       There is no need to choose an entropy source, and some users of this
       module have omitted that step, and prior to version 0.008 they may have
       been relying on Perl's builtin "rand" function.

       Please see CPAN Author's Guide to Random Data for Security
       <https://security.metacpan.org/docs/guides/random-data-for-security.html>.

DESCRIPTION
       This module maintains a concept of a current selection of entropy
       source.  Algorithms that require entropy, such as those in
       Data::Entropy::Algorithms, can use the source nominated by this module,
       avoiding the need for entropy source objects to be explicitly passed
       around.  This is convenient because usually one entropy source will be
       used for an entire program run and so an explicit entropy source
       parameter would rarely vary.  There is also a default entropy source,
       avoiding the need to explicitly configure a source at all.

       If nothing is done to set a source then it defaults to the use of
       Rijndael (AES) in counter mode (see
       Data::Entropy::RawSource::CryptCounter and Crypt::Rijndael), keyed
       using Crypt::URandom.

FUNCTIONS
       entropy_source
           Returns the current entropy source, a "Data::Entropy::Source"
           object.  This will be the source passed to the innermost call to
           "with_entropy_source", if any, or otherwise the default entropy
           source.

       with_entropy_source SOURCE, CLOSURE
           The SOURCE is selected, so that it will be returned by
           "entropy_source", and CLOSURE is called (with no arguments).  The
           SOURCE is selected only during the dynamic scope of the call; after
           CLOSURE finishes, by whatever means, the previously selected
           entropy source is restored.

           SOURCE is normally a "Data::Entropy::Source" object.
           Alternatively, it may be "undef" to cause use of the default
           entropy source.  It may also be a reference to a function of no
           arguments, which will be called to generate the actual source only
           if required.  This avoids unnecessarily initialising the source
           object if it is uncertain whether any entropy will be required.
           The source-generating closure may return a normal source or
           "undef", but not another function reference.
