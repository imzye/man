NAME
       e2guardian2 - web content filter


SYNOPSIS
       e2guardian [ -c config-file ] [ -v ] [ -h ] [ -N ] [ -q ] [ -Q ] [ -s ]
       [ -r ] [ -g ]

SUMMARY
       e2guardian is a web content filtering proxy(1) for Linux, NetBSD,
       FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and Solaris that uses Squid(2) to do all the
       fetching.

       It filters using multiple methods. These methods include URL and domain
       filtering, content phrase filtering, PICS filtering, MIME type
       filtering, file extension filtering, POST limiting and content (AV)
       scanning.

       The content phrase filtering will check for pages that contain
       profanities and phrases often associated with pornography and other
       undesirable content.  The POST filtering allows you to block or limit
       web uploads.  The URL and domain filtering is able to handle huge lists
       and is significantly faster than squidGuard.

       Content scanning enables downloaded content to be passed through ClamD,
       KAVD, any local program with machine-parseable console output, and any
       other AV scanner available as an ICAP server.

       The filtering has configurable domain, user and source IP exception
       lists.  SSL tunneling is supported; however, due to the encrypted
       nature of HTTPS requests, filtering is only supported on destination
       domain or with SSL MITM configuration.  The configurable logging
       produces a log in an easy to read format which has the option to only
       log the text-based pages, thus significantly reducing redundant
       information such as every image on a page.

       e2guardian is under continuous development and so it is best to visit
       the web site for the latest information.

        (1) Technically e2guardian is more of a filtering pass-through than a
       true proxy - but don't let that worry you!

        (2) e2guardian should work with any proxy, not just Squid. For
       example, it is known to work with Oops.

OPTIONS
       -c config-file
              Use the given config-file.

       -v     gives the version number and build options.

       -h     Output a short summary of available command line options.

       -N     Do not go into the background.

       -q     causes e2guardian to kill any running copy.

       -Q     kill any running copy AND start a new one with current options.

       -s     shows the parent process PID and exits.

       -r     closes all connections and reloads config files by issuing a
              HUP, but this does not reset the maxchildren option (amongst
              others).

       -g     gently restarts by not closing all current connections; only
              reloads filter group config files. (Issues a USR1)
