RPSL2ACL
       rpsl2acl - create a list of CIDRs from RPSL database

SYNOPSIS
       rpsl2acl [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Rpsl2acl queries a set of RPSL objects from a whois server, extracts
       members: records and converts them into a list of non-overlapping CIDR
       values.  The resulting list is sorted lexicographically.

       The program exits with code 0 if the file is up to date, 1 if it has
       successfully updated the file, 2 if some error ocurred and 3 if the
       command line usage was incorrect.

OPTIONS
       The following options control the output:

       --acl=name
           Format output as a bind ACL statement with the given name.

       --comment=string
           Print string as the heading comment to the output.  The argument
           can consist of multiple lines.  A "#" sign will be printed before
           each of them.

       --outfile=FILE, -o FILE
           Write the result to FILE, instead of the default "netlist".

       The following options control the selection of RPSL objects and initial
       contents of the output list:

       --add-network=arg
           Add given CIDRs to the output list.  Argument is a comma-separated
           list of CIDRs.

       --from-file=FILE, -T FILE
           Populate the output list with CIDRs read from FILE.  The file must
           list each CIDR on a separate line.  Empty lines and comments
           (introduced by "#" sign) are ignored.

       --objects=objlist, -r objlist
           Defines a list of objects to query.  Objlist is a comma-separated
           list of RPSL object names.

       The following options control TCP connections:

       --no-persistent
           Disable persistent connection.  Rpsl2acl will open a new connection
           to the whois server for each RPSL object it is about to query.

       --whois-server=server
           Query this server, instead of the default "whois.ripe.net".

       Options controlling log and debug output:

       --log-file=FILE, -l FILE
           Write the diagnostic output to FILE, instead of standard error.

       --debug[=spec[,spec...]], -d[spec[,spec...]]
           Set debugging level.  Spec is either category or category=level,
           category is a debugging category name and level is a decimal
           verbosity level.  Valid categories are: "GENERAL" and "WHOIS".

       --dry-run, -n
           Don't create the output file.  Instead print the result on the
           standard output.

       Informational options:

       --help, -h
           Show a terse help summary and exit.

       --man
           Print the manual page and exit.

CONFIGURATION
       The program reads its configuration from one of the following
       locations:

       a. File name given by "RPSL2ACL_CONF" environment variable (if set)
       b. ~/.rpsl2acl.conf
       c. /etc/rpsl2acl.conf

       The first existing file from this list is read.  It is an error, if the
       $RPSL2ACL_CONF variable is set, but points to a file that does not
       exist.  It is not an error if $RPSL2ACL_CONF is not set and neither of
       the two remaining files exist.  It is, however, an error if any of
       these file exists, but is not readable.

       The configuration file uses a usual UNIX configuration format.  Empty
       lines and UNIX comments are ignored.  Each non-empty line is either an
       option name, or option assignment, i.e. opt=val, with any amount of
       optional whitespace around the equals sign.  Valid option names are the
       same as long command line options, but without the leading --.  For
       example:

         objects = RS-FOO,RS-BAR,RS-BAZ
         aclname = mynets
         add-network = 10.0.0.0/8
         outfile = networks.inc

ENVIRONMENT
       RPSL2ACL_CONF
           The name of the configuration file to read, instead of the default
           /etc/rpsl2acl.conf.
