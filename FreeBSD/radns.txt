NAME
       radns - Resolving DNS Server Client for IPv6.

SYNOPSIS
       radns [ -v [ -v ] [ -v ] ] [ -f path to resolv file ] [ -l maximum
       number of domain suffixes in search list ] [ -m maximum number of
       resolver addresses ] [ -u user ] [ -s path to script ] [ -p path to
       pidfile ]


DESCRIPTION
       radns listens for IPv6 Router Advertisements with the Recursive DNS
       Server (RDNSS) option and stores the address(es) in a file in the same
       syntax as resolv.conf(5). It optionally starts a script when it
       receives a Router Advertisement.

OPTIONS
       -V     prints version information and quits the program.

       -v     turns on verbose mode and gives more debug output. Also stops
              the process from becoming a daemon. Repeated -v increases
              verbosity.

       -f path to resolv file
              specifies the filename to write the IPv6 addresses to. Default
              is "./resolv.conf".

       Note that the radns user needs write access to the directory since it
       will create a temporary working file and rename it to whatever you
       specify as the resolv file. Typically you use something like
       /etc/radns/ra-resolv.conf as the resolv file with /etc/radns being
       writable by the radns user.

       If radns is run on an IPv6-only machine, with no dual-stack, you may
       want to make /etc/resolv.conf a symbolic link to /etc/radns/ra-
       resolv.conf.

       -l maximum number of domain suffixes in search list specifies
              the number of domain suffixes to store after the search keyword
              in the resolv.conf file. 0 is a special case meaning an
              unlimited number. The default is 6.

       -m maximum number of resolver addresses
              specifies the number of resolver addresses to store in the
              resolv.conf file. 0 is a special case meaning an unlimited
              number. The default is 3.

       -u username
              specifies the user to drop privileges to. Default is radns.

       -s path to script
              specifies a program to run after receiving new addresses to DNS
              resolvers. Default is not to run a script.

       -p path to pidfile
              specifies a path to a file to write the process ID into for
              process management purposes. Default is "/var/run/radns.pid".
