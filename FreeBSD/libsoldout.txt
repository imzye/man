MKD2HTML(1)             FreeBSD General Commands Manual            MKD2HTML(1)

NAME
     mkd2html – convert a markdown document into (X)HTML

SYNOPSIS
     mkd2html [-dHhmnx] [file]

DESCRIPTION
     mkd2html utility reads file and generates (X)HTML input from markdown
     source.  If unspecified, file is taken to be standard input.

     By default, mkd2html implies -H and -m options.

     The options are as follows:

     -d, --discount
             enable Discount extensions:

             •  image size specification, by appending "=(width)x(height)" to
                the link

             •  pseudo-protocols in links:

                •  abbr:description for <abbr title="description">...</abbr>

                •  class:name for <span class="name">...</span>

                •  id:name for <span id="name">...</span>

                •  raw:text for verbatim unprocessed text inclusion

             •  class blocks: blockquotes beginning with %class% will be
                rendered as a div of the given class(es)

             and PHP-Markdown-like tables.

     -H, --html
             output HTML (self-closing tags like: <br>).

     -h, --help
             display help text.

     -m, --markdown
             disable all extensions and use strict markdown syntax.

     -n, --natext
             enable Discount extensions and Natasha's own extensions:

             •  id attribute for headers, using the syntax id#Header text

             •  class attribute for paragraphs, by putting class name(s)
                between parenthesis at the very beginning of the paragraph

             •  <ins> and <del> spans, using respectively ++ and -- as
                delimiters (with emphasis-like restrictions, i.e. an opening
                delimiter cannot be followed by a whitespace, and a closing
                delimiter cannot be preceded by a whitespace)

             •  plain <span> without attribute, using emphasis-like delimiter
                |

     -x, --xhtml
             output XHTML (self-closing tags like: <br />).

EXIT STATUS
     The mkd2html utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
