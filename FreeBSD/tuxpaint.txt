DESCRIPTION
       Tux Paint is a drawing program for young children.  It is meant to be
       easy and fun to use.  It provides a simple interface and fixed canvas
       size, and provides access to previous images using a thumbnail browser
       (i.e., no access to the underlying filesystem).

       Unlike popular drawing programs like "The GIMP," it has a very limited
       toolset. However, it provides a much simpler interface, and has
       entertaining, child-oriented additions such as sound effects.


OPTIONS - INFORMATIONAL
       tuxpaint accepts the following options to emit information about the
       program.  It then exits immediately (without opening a graphical
       window).


       --help  Display short, helpful information about Tux Paint.

       --version
               Output the version info.

       --verbose-version
               Output the version info and compile-time build options.

       --usage Display a list of all commandline options.

       --copying
               Show the license (GNU GPL) under which Tux Paint is released.

       --listfonts
               Display a list of fonts found by Pango (and so available to Tux
               Paint via --uifont).


OPTIONS - INTERFACE
       tuxpaint accepts the following options to alter the interface.  They
       can be used along with, instead of, or to override options set in
       configuration files. (See below.)


   VIDEO
       --fullscreen=yes --fullscreen=native --fullscreen=no --windowed
               Run Tux Paint in full-screen mode at its default -- or a
               specified -- screen resolution ("--fullscreen=yes"); or in
               full-screen mode at the system's native resolution
               ("--fullscreen=native"); or run in a window ("--fullscreen=no"
               or "--windowed") (default).


       --native
               When in fullscreen mode, use the system's default screen
               resolution.


       --WIDTHxHEIGHT
               Run Tux Paint in a particularly-sized window, or at a
               particular fullscreen resolution (if --native is not used).
               Default is 800x600.  Minimum width is 640.  Minimum height is
               480.  Portrait and landscape orientations are both supported.
               (Also see --orient, below.)


       --orient=landscape --orient=portrait
               If --orient=portrait is set, asks Tux Paint to swap the WIDTH
               and HEIGHT values it uses for windowed or fullscreen mode,
               without having to actually change the WIDTH and HEIGHT values
               in the configuration file or on the command-line. (This is
               useful on devices where the screen can be rotated, e.g. tablet
               PCs.)


       --allowscreensaver --disablescreensaver
               Normally, tuxpaint disables your screensaver. Use
               --allowscreensaver to prevent this from happening.


   SOUND
       --nosound --sound
               Disable or enable (default) sound.


       --nostereo --stereo
               Disable or enable (default) stereo panning support.


   INTERFACE SIZE
       --buttonsize SIZE --buttonsize auto
               Adjust the size of the buttons in Tux Paint's user interface,
               between 24 and 192 pixels (48 is the default, and suitable for
               displays with 96 to 120dpi pixel density). Use "auto" to have
               Tux Paint choose a button size based on Tux Paint's
               window/display size.


       --colorsrows=ROWS
               How many rows of color palette buttons to show; useful when
               using a large color palette, and/or for use with coarse input
               devices (like eyegaze trackers).  It can be between 1 (default)
               and 3.


   INTERFACE SIMPLIFICATION
       --simpleshapes --complexshapes
               Disable or enable (default) the rotation step when using the
               Shape tool within Tux Paint.  When disabled, shapes cannot be
               rotated; however, the interface is easier (click, drag,
               release), which can be useful for younger or disabled children.


       --nooutlines --outlines
               With "--nooutlines" enabled, much simpler outlines and 'rubber-
               band' lines are displayed when using the Lines, Shapes, Stamps
               and Eraser tools. (This can help when Tux Paint is run on
               slower computers, or displayed on a remote terminal.)


       --uppercase --mixedcase
               With "--uppercase" enabled, all text prompts and the Text and
               Label drawing tools will display only uppercase letters.  This
               is useful for children who are not yet comfortable with the
               lowercase characterset.  Default mode is mixed case.


   INITIAL STAMP SIZE
       --stampsize=SIZE --stampsize=default
               Overrides the default size of all stamps, relative to their
               possible sizes (determined by Tux Paint, based on the
               dimensions of both the stamps themselves, and the drawing
               canvas).  Valid values are from 0 (smallest) to 10 (largest).
               Use "--stampsize=default" to let Tux Paint choose on a per-
               stamp basis (this is the default setting).


   STARTING OUT
       --startblank --startlast
               When you start Tux Paint, it loads the last image that was
               being worked on.
                The "--startblank" option disables this, so it always starts
               with a blank canvas.  The default behavior is "--startlast".


       --newcolorslast --newcolorsfirst
               List solid (blank) colors at the end, or beginning (default) of
               the options displayed when using the New tool to start a new
               picture.


   CONTROL SIMPLIFICATION
       --noquit --quit
               Disable or enable (default) the on-screen Quit button and
               [Escape] key for quitting Tux Paint.  Instead, use the window
               close button in the titlebar, the [Alt]+[F4] key sequence, or
               the [Shift]+[Control]+[Escape] key sequence.


       --nostamps --stamps
               With "--nostamps" set, Rubber Stamp images are not loaded, so
               the Stamps tool will not be available.  This option can be used
               to reduce the time Tux Paint takes to load, and reduce the
               amount of RAM it requires.


       --nostampcontrols --stampcontrols
               Disable or enable (default) buttons to control stamps.
               Controls include mirror, flip, shrink and grow.  (Note: Not all
               stamps will be controllable in all ways.)


       --nostamprotation --stamprotation
               Disable or enable (default) the rotation step when placing a
               stamp in the drawing.


       --nomagiccontrols --magiccontrols
               Disable or enable (default) buttons to control Magic tools.
               Controls include controlling whether a Magic tool is used like
               a paint brush, or if it affects the entire image at once.
               (Note: Not all Magic tools will be controllable.)


       --nomagicsizes --magicsizes
               Disable or enable (default) Magic size controls.  (Note: Not
               all Magic tools offer size controls.)


       --ungroupmagictools --groupmagictools
               Disable or enable (default) grouping of Magic tools.


       --noshapecontrols --shapecontrols
               Disable or enable (default) buttons to change the Shape tool's
               behavior -- shapes expanding from the center, or from a corner,
               where the mouse is initially clicked.


       --nolabel --label
               Disable or enable (default) the Label tool, which lets you
               create text which can be altered or moved later.


       --nobrushspacing --brushspacing
               Disable or enable (default) the brush spacing option of the
               Paint and Lines tools, which allows you to override the default
               spacing of a brush.


       --complexity=advanced --complexity=beginner --complexity=novice
               Set the complexity (expertise) level, which affects whether
               certain Magic tools are available, or how they operate.
               (advanced is the default)


       --notemplateexport --templateexport
               Disable or enable (default) the ability to create new Templates
               from saved drawings via the Open dialog.


       --noerase --erase
               The --noerase option disables Tux Paint's ability to erase
               files (saved drawings, via the Open dialog, and exported
               templates, via the New dialog).  Useful to prevent a user from
               accidentally erasing their own work, or that of others
               (especially used in combination with --saveovernew).


OPTIONS - CONTROLLING TUX PAINT
       tuxpaint accepts the following options to alter how you control Tux
       Paint.  They can be used along with, instead of, or to override options
       set in configuration files. (See below.)


   CURSOR
       --nofancycursors --fancycursors
               Disable or enable (default) the 'fancy' mouse pointer shapes in
               Tux Paint.  While the shapes are larger, and context sensitive,
               some environments have trouble displaying the mouse pointer,
               and/or leave 'trails' on the screen.


       --hidecursor --showcursor
               Completely hide, or enable (default) the mouse pointer in Tux
               Paint. This can be useful on touchscreen devices, such as
               tablet PCs.


   KEYBOARD
       --noshortcuts --shortcuts
               If "--noshortcuts" mode, keyboard shortcuts (e.g., [Ctrl]+[S]
               for Save) will be disabled.  Default mode is for shortcuts to
               be enabled.


   MOUSE AND ACCESSIBILITY
       --grab --dontgrab
               Grab the mouse and keyboard input (if possible), so that the
               mouse is confined to the Tux Paint window.  Default is to not
               grab.


       --nowheelmouse --wheelmouse
               By default, the wheel (jog dial) on a mouse will be used to
               scroll the completely ignored, with the "--nowheelmouse"
               option. This is useful for children who aren't yet comfortable
               with the mouse. Default is to support the wheel.


       --mouse-accessibility
               In this mode, instead of clicking, dragging and releasing
               (e.g., to draw), you click, move, and click again to end the
               motion. ("Sticky mouse clicks.")


       --keyboard --mouse
               The "--keyboard" option lets the mouse pointer in Tux Paint be
               controlled with the keyboard.  The [Up], [Down], [Left], and
               [Right] arrow keys move the pointer. [Spacebar] acts as the
               mouse button.


       --nobuttondistinction --buttondistinction
               By default, only mouse button #1 (typically the leftmost mouse
               button on mice with more than one button) can be used for
               interacting with Tux Paint.
                With the "--nobuttondistinction" option, mouse buttons #2
               (middle) and #3 (right) can be used, as well. This is useful
               for children who aren't yet comfortable with the mouse. Default
               is to only recognize button #1.


   ONSCREEN KEYBOARD
       --onscreen-keyboard
               Presents a clickable on-screen keyboard when using the Text and
               Label tools.


       --onscreen-keyboard-layout LAYOUT
               Specify the default layout for the on-screen keyboard (see
               above).


       --onscreen-keyboard-disable-change
               Disables the left/right arrow buttons visible on the on-screen
               keyboard, which are used to switch between the available on-
               screen keyboard layouts.


   JOYSTICK
       --joystick-dev=DEVICE
               Specify which joystick device should be used by Tux Paint.
               Default value is 0 (the first joystick).


       --joystick-dev=list
               List the system's available joysticks and exit. (Does not
               launch Tux Paint.)


       --joystick-slowness=SPEED
               Sets a delay at each axis motion, allowing to slow the
               joystick. Allowed values are from 0 to 500. Default value is
               15.


       --joystick-threshold=THRESHOLD
               Sets the minimum level of axis motion to start moving the
               pointer. Allowed values are from 0 to 32766. Default value is
               3200.


       --joystick-maxsteps=STEPS
               Sets the maximum pixels the pointer will move at once. Allowed
               values are from 1 to 7. Default value is 7.


       --joystick-hat-timeout=MILLISECONDS
               Sets the delay after wich the pointer will start moving
               automatically if the hat is keeped pushed. Allowed values are
               from 0 to 3000. Default value is 1000.


       --joystick-hat-slowness=SPEED
               Sets a delay at each automatic motion, allowing to slow the
               speed of the hat. Allowed values are from 0 to 500. Default
               value is 15.


       --joystick-btn-escape=BUTTON
               Selects the joystick button number, as seen by SDL, that will
               be used to generate a escape event. Useful to dismiss dialogs
               and quit.


       --joystick-btn-COMMAND=BUTTON
               Selects the joystick button number, as seen by SDL, that will
               be a shortcut to various tools within Tux Paint.


              - brush | Paint
              - stamp | Stamp
              - lines | Lines
              - shapes | Shapes

              - save | Save
              - pgsetup | Print (dialog)
              - print | Print (immediate)


       --joystick-buttons-ignore=BUTTON1,BUTTON2,...
               A set of joystick button numbers, as seen by SDL, that should
               be ignored.  Otherwise, unless they are used by one of the
               "--joystick-btn-..." options above, buttons will be seen as a
               mouse left-click.  Comma-separated.


OPTIONS - PRINTING
       tuxpaint accepts the following options to alter how Tux Paint handles
       printing.  They can be used along with, instead of, or to override
       options set in configuration files. (See below.)


   PRINT PERMISSIONS
       --noprint --print
               Disable or enable (default) the Print command within Tux Paint.


       --printdelay=SECONDS --printdelay=0
               Only allow printing (via the Print command) once every SECONDS
               seconds.  Default is 0 (no limitation).


   SHOW PRINTER DIALOG
       --altprintmod --altprintnever --altprintalways
               These options control whether an system printer dialog appears
               when the user clicks the Print button.  By default
               ("--altprintmod"), pressing [Alt] while clicking Print will
               bring up a dialog (unless you're in fullscreen mode).  With
               "--altprintalways", the dialog will always appear, even if
               [Alt] is not being held.  With "--altprintnever", the dialog
               will never appear, even if [Alt] is being held.


   SAVE PRINTER CONFIGURATION
       --printcfg --noprintcfg
               (Windows and Mac OS X only.)  Enable or disable loading and
               saving of printer settings.  By default, Tux Paint will print
               to the default printer with default settings.  Pressing [Alt]
               while pushing the Print button will cause a printer dialog to
               appear (as long as you're not in fullscreen mode; see also
               "--altprintalways" and "--altprintnever", below.)  Unless
               "--noprintcfg" is used, your previous settings will be loaded
               when Tux Paint starts up, and setting changes will be saved for
               next time.


   PRINT COMMANDS
       --printcommand COMMAND
               (Only when PostScript printing is used.) Have Tux Paint print
               via an alternate command, rather than lpr(1).


       --altprintcommand COMMAND
               (Only when PostScript printing is used.) Have Tux Paint print
               via an alternate command, when a dialog is expect (e.g., when
               holding [Alt] while clicking Print; see above), rather than
               kprinter.


   PAPER SIZE
       --papersize PAPERSIZE
               (Only when PostScript printing is used.) Ask Tux Paint to
               generate PostScript of a particular paper size. Valid sizes are
               those supported by libpaper.  See papersize(5).


OPTIONS - SAVING
       tuxpaint accepts the following options to alter how Tux Paint operates
       when saving or exporting drawings.  They can be used along with,
       instead of, or to override options set in configuration files. (See
       below.)


   SAVE OVER EARLIER WORK
       --saveover --saveovernew --saveoverask
               If, when saving a picture, an older version of the file will be
               overwritten, Tux Paint will, by default, ask for confirmation:
               either save over the old file, or create a new file.  This
               prompt can be disabled with "--saveover" (which always saves
               over older versions of pictures) or "--saveovernew" (which
               always saves a new file). The default is to prompt
               ("--saveoverask").


   SAVE AND EXPORT DIRECTORIES
       --savedir DIR
               Specify where Tux Paint should save and load its drawings.


       --exportdir DIR
               Specify where Tux Paint should export drawings and animations.


   MORE SAVING OPTIONS
       --nosave --save
               The --nosave option disables Tux Paint's ability to save files.
               This can be used in situations where the program is only being
               used for fun, or in a test environment.


       --autosave --noautosave
               The --autosave option prevents Tux Paint from asking whether
               you want to save the current picture when quitting, and assumes
               you do.


       --reversesort --noautosave
               The --reversesort option causes Tux Paint's Open and Slideshow
               dialogs to display the oldest images at the top of the list
               (normally the newest appear at the top, and the oldest at the
               bottom.


OPTIONS - DATA FILES
       tuxpaint accepts the following options to alter where Tux Paint loads
       data (stamps, brushes, etc.)  They can be used along with, instead of,
       or to override options set in configuration files. (See below.)


       --datadir DIR
               Specify where Tux Paint should look for personal data files
               (brushes, stamps, etc.).


       --colorfile FILE
               This option allows you to override the default color palette in
               Tux Paint and replace it with your own. The file should be a
               plain ASCII text file containing one color description per
               line. Colors may be in decimal or 6- or 3-digit hexadecimal,
               and followed by a description. (For example, "#000 Black" and
               "255 192 64 Orange".)


OPTIONS - LANGUAGE
       tuxpaint accepts the following options to alter the language used by
       Tux Paint's interface, and other related settings.  They can be used
       along with, instead of, or to override options set in configuration
       files. (See below.)

       Various parts of Tux Paint have been translated into numerous
       languages.  Tux Paint will try its best to honor your locale setting
       (i.e., the "LANG" environment variable), if possible. You can also
       specifically set the language using options on the command-line or in a
       configuration file.


       --locale LOCALE
               Specify the language to use, based on locale name (which is
               typically of the form
               "language[_territory][.codeset][@modifier], where "language" is
               an ISO 639 language code, "territory" is an ISO 3166 country
               code, and "codeset" is a character set or encoding identifier
               like "ISO-8859-1" or "UTF-8".)

              For example, "de_DE@euro" for German, or "pt_BR" for Brazilian
              Portuguese.


       --lang LANGUAGE
               Specify the language to use, based on the language's name (as
               recognized by Tux Paint).  Choose one of the language names
               listed below:

       --lang help
               Display a lists of all supported languages.


       --mirrorstamps --dontmirrorstamps
               With "--mirrorstamps" set, stamps which can be mirrored will
               appear mirrored by default.  This can be useful when used by
               people who prefer things right-to-left over left-to-right.


   FONTS
       --nosysfonts --sysfonts
               Tux Paint normally attempts to search for additional TrueType
               Fonts installed in common places on your system.  If this
               causes trouble, or you'd prefer to only make fonts installed in
               Tux Paint's directory available, use the "--nosysfonts" option
               to disable this feature.


       --alllocalefonts --currentlocalefont
               Tux Paint avoids loading any fonts found in its "locale" font
               subdirectory, except any that match the current locale Tux
               Paint is running under. Use the "--alllocalefonts" option to
               load all such fonts, for use in the Text and Label tools. (This
               was the default behavior, prior to version 0.9.21.)


       --uifont="FONT NAME" --uifont=default
               Specify the name of a font for Tux Paint to attempt to use for
               its user interface (UI) -- button labels, dialog pop-up text,
               instructional text at the bottom. If left unspecified, or
               "default" is given, then "DejaVu Sans" will be used. (This was
               the default behavior, prior to version 0.9.31.)


OPTIONS - MISCELLANEOUS
       tuxpaint accepts the following options to alter its behavior. They can
       be used along with, instead of, or to override options set in
       configuration files. (See below.)


       --nosysconfig
               With this option, Tux Paint will not attempt to read the
               system-wide configuration file (typically
               "/etc/tuxpaint/tuxpaint.conf" or
               "/usr/local/etc/tuxpaint/tuxpaint.conf").


       --nolockfile
               By default, Tux Paint uses a lockfile (stored in the user's
               local Tux Paint directory) which prevents it from being
               launched more than once in 30 seconds. (Sometimes children get
               too eager, or user interfaces only require one click, but users
               think they need to double-click.) This option makes Tux Paint
               ignore the current lockfile.


ENVIRONMENT
       While Tux Paint may refer to a number of environment variables
       indirectly (e.g., via SDL(3)), it directly accesses the following: (See
       "FILES" below, as well.)

       HOME    to determine where picture files go when using the Save and
               Open commands within Tux Paint, to keep track of the current
               image, when quitting and restarting Tux Paint, and to get the
               user's configuration file.


       LANG, LC_ALL, LANGUAGE, and LC_MESSAGES
               to determine language to use, if setlocale(3) refers to
               "LC_MESSAGES".


       SDL_VIDEO_ALLOW_SCREENSAVER
               Set this environment variable to '1' to allow a screensaver to
               appear while Tux Paint is running. This can also be done via
               the "--allowscreensaver" option.


       SDL_VIDEO_WINDOW_POS
               If this is NOT set, Tux Paint will set it to "center", to
               attempt to place the Tux Paint window in the center of a
               display. If it IS set (e.g., to "nopref", meaning "no
               preference"), Tux Paint will not override it.


FILES
       [/usr/local/]/etc/tuxpaint/tuxpaint.conf
               System-wide configuration file.  It is read first (unless the
               "--nosysconfig" option was given on the command-line).

               (Created during installation.)

       $HOME/.tuxpaintrc
               User's configuration file.  It can be used to set default
               options (rather than setting them on the command-line every
               time), and/or to override any settings in the system-wide
               configuration file.

               (Not created or edited automatically; must be created manually.
               You can do this by hand, or use tuxpaint-config(1).)

       $HOME/.tuxpaint/saved/
               A directory of previously-saved images (and thumbnails).  Only
               files in this directory will be made available using the Open
               command within Tux Paint.  Overridden via the "--savedir"
               option.

               (Created when Save command is used.)

       $HOME/.tuxpaint/current_id.txt
               A reference to the image which was being edited when Tux Paint
               was last quit.  (This image is automatically loaded the next
               time Tux Paint is re-run, unless the "--startblank" option is
               set.)

               (Created when Tux Paint is Quit.)

       $HOME/.tuxpaint/lockfile.dat
               A lockfile that prevents Tux Paint from being launched more
               than once every 30 seconds.  Disable checking the lockfile by
               using the "--nolockfile" option.

               (There's no reason to delete the lockfile, as it contains a
               timestamp inside which causes it to expire after 30 seconds.)

       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME[XDG_PICTURES_DIR]/TuxPaint/
               A directory where images and animations should be exported (via
               options found in Tux Paint's Open dialog), if the "--exportdir"
               option is not used to override it.  If "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME" is
               set, a configuration file "user-dirs.dirs" will be scanned
               within the directory it points to; if not, Tux Paint will
               attempt to do so within "$HOME/.config/".  If a setting named
               "XDG_PICTURES_DIR" is found, it will be used as the location to
               export images. If all else fails, then "$HOME/Pictures/" will
               be used.  A "TuxPaint" subdirectory will be created.

       $XDG_DATA_HOME/Trash/ or $HOME/.local/share/Trash/
               A directory where images are placed when the Erase option is
               used from the Open dialog.
