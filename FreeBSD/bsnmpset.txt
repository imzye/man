DESCRIPTION
     bsnmpget, bsnmpwalk and bsnmpset are simple tools for retrieving
     management information from and setting management information to a
     Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) agent.

     Depending on the options bsnmpget constructs either a SNMP GetRequest,
     GetNextRequest or a GetBulkRequest packet, fills in the object
     identifiers (OIDs) of the objects whose values will be retrieved, waits
     for a response and prints it if received successfully.

     Bsnmpwalk queries an agent with ether SNMP GetNextRequest or
     GetBulkRequest packets, asking for values of OID instances that are a
     part of the object subtree rooted at the provided OIDs.

     Bsnmpset constructs a SNMP SetRequest packet, fills in the OIDs (object
     identifiers), syntaxes and values of the objects whose values are to be
     set and waits for a response from server.

OPTIONS
     The options are as follows (not all apply to all three programs):

     -A options           Authentication options to use with SNMPv3 PDUs

                          proto=[md5|sha]
                            The protocol to use when calculating the PDU
                            message digest.

                          key=authkey
                            A binary localized authentication key to use when
                            calculating the PDU message digest.

                          By default SNMPv3 PDUs are sent unauthenticated.

     -a                   Skip any sanity checks when adding OIDs to a
                          Protocol Data Unit (PDU): ingore syntax/access type,
                          allow adding of non-leaf objects for GetPdu and
                          read-only objects to a SetPDU.

     -b buffersize        Tune the size of buffers used to send and receive
                          packets.  The default size is 10000 bytes which
                          should be enough unless an agent sends a really
                          large octetstring.  The maximum allowed length is
                          65535 according to the Structure of Management
                          Information (SMIv2).

     -C options           The context to query with SNMPv3 PDUs.

                          context=name
                            The context name. Default is "" (empty).

                          context-engine=engine-id
                            The SNMP Engine ID of the context to query with
                            SNMPv3 PDUs, represented as binary octet string.
                            By default, this is set to the Engine ID of the
                            SNMP agent.

     -D                   Perform SNMP USM Engine Discovery, rather than
                          sending a request for the value of a specific
                          object.

     -d                   Turn on debugging.  This option will cause the
                          packets sent and received to be dumped to the
                          terminal.

     -e                   Retry on error.  If an error is returned in the
                          response PDU, resend the request removing the
                          variable that caused the error until a valid
                          response is received.  This is only useful for a
                          GetRequest- and a GetNextRequest-PDU.

     -h                   Print a short help text with default values for
                          various options.

     -I options           Load each MIB description file from the given list
                          to translate symbolic object names to their
                          numerical representation and vice versa.  Use the
                          other options to obtain a non-default behaviour:

                          cut=OID
                            Specifies the initial OID that was cut by
                            gensnmpdef(1) when producing the MIB description
                            file.  The default value is .iso(1).org(3).dod(6)
                            which is what should have been used for all the
                            files installed under /usr/share/snmp/defs.  Use
                            this only if you generated your own files,
                            providing a -c option to gensnmpdef(1).

                          path=filedir
                            The directory where files in the list will be
                            searched.  The default is /usr/share/snmp/defs.

                          file=filelist
                            A comma separated list of files to which the two
                            options above will apply.

                          The file suboption has to come after the other
                          suboptions so that their non-default values will be
                          applied to the list of files.  The order of the
                          other suboptions before each file suboption can be
                          random.  Suboptions may be separated either by
                          commas or by spaces.  If using spaces make sure the
                          entire option string is one argument, for example
                          using quotes.

     -i filelist          List of MIB description files produced by
                          gensnmpdef(1) which bsnmpget, bsnmpwalk or bsnmpset
                          will search to translate numerical OIDs to their
                          symbolic object names.  Multiple files can be
                          provided either giving this option multiple times or
                          a comma separated list of file names.  If a filename
                          begins with a letter the default directory,
                          /usr/share/snmp/defs, will be searched.

     -K                   Calculate and display the localized authentication
                          and privacy keys corresponding to a plain text
                          password.  The password is obtained via the
                          environment.  Additionally, if one or more OIDs are
                          specified, the calculated keys are used when
                          processing the SNMPv3 requests.

     -l filename          The path of the posix local (unix domain) socket if
                          local transport is used.

     -M max-repetitions   The value for the max-repetitions field in a GetBulk
                          PDU.  Default is 10.

     -N non-repeaters     The value for the non-repeaters field in a GetBulk
                          PDU.  Default is 0.

     -n                   Only use numerical representations for input and
                          output OIDs and do not try to resolve symbolic
                          object names.  Note that bsnmpget, bsnmpwalk and
                          bsnmpset will print numerical OIDs anyway if the
                          corresponding string representation is not found in
                          the MIB description files.

     -o [quiet|short|verbose]
                          The format used to print the received response.
                          Quiet only prints values, short (default) prints an
                          abbreviated OID representation and the value.  In
                          addition to the short output verbose prints the type
                          before the value.

     -P options           Privacy options to use with SNMPv3 PDUs

                          proto=[aes|des]
                            The protocol to use when encrypting/decrypting
                            SNMPv3 PDU data.

                          key=privkey
                            A binary localized privacy key to use when
                            encrypting/decrypting SNMPv3 PDU data.

                          By default plain text SNMPv3 PDUs are sent.

     -p [get|getnext|getbulk]
                          The PDU type to send by bsmpget and bsnmpwalk.
                          Default is get for bsmpget and getnext for
                          bsnmpwalk.  Getbulk allows executing the so called
                          SNMP "bulkwalks" allowing the values of multiple
                          columns to be retrieved in a single PDU by
                          bsnmpwalk.

     -r retries           Number of resends of request packets before giving
                          up if the agent does not respond after the first
                          try.  Default is 3.

     -s [trans::][community@][server][:port]
                          Each of the server specification components is
                          optional but at least one has to be provided if the
                          s option is used.  The server specification is
                          constructed in the following manner:

                          trans::
                            Transport type may be one of udp, stream or dgram.
                            If this option is not provided an UDP inet/inet6
                            socket will be used, which is the most common.
                            Stream stands for a posix local stream socket and
                            a posix local datagram socket will be used if
                            dgram is specified.

                          community@
                            Specify an SNMP community string to be used when
                            sending packets.  If the option is skipped the
                            default "public" will be used for bsnmpget and
                            bsnmpwalk and the default "private" community
                            string will be used for bsnmpset.

                          server
                            This might be either the IP address or the
                            hostname where the agent is listening.  The
                            default is "localhost".

                          port
                            The destination port to send the requests to.
                            This is useful if the SNMP agent listens on a non-
                            default port.  Default is given by the "snmp"
                            entry in /etc/services, port 161.

     -t timeout           Number of seconds before resending a request packet
                          if the agent does not respond.  The default value is
                          3 seconds.

     -U options           User credentials when sending SNMPv3 PDUs.

                          engine=id
                            The Engine ID of the SNMP agent represented as a
                            binary octet string.

                          engine-boots=value
                            The value of the snmpEngineBoots of the SNMP
                            agent.

                          engine-time=value
                            The value of the snmpEngineTime of the SNMP agent.

                            If any of the above is not specified, SNMP USM
                            Engine Discovery is attempted.  This is also the
                            default behavior.

                          name=username
                            The USM user name to include in the SNMPv3 PDUs.
                            By default, the user name is obtained via the
                            environment.

     -v version           The SNMP protocol version to use when sending
                          requests.  SNMP versions 1, 2 and 3 are supported.
                          If no version option is provided bsnmpget, bsnmpwalk
                          and bsnmpset will use version 2.  Note that
                          GetBulkRequest-PDUs were introduced in SNMPv2 thus
                          setting the version to 1 is incompatible with
                          sending a GetBulk PDU.

     OID                  The object identifier whose value to retrieve.  At
                          least one OID should be provided for bsnmpget to be
                          able to send a request.

                          For bsnmpwalk this is the root object identifier of
                          the subtree whose values are to be retrieved.  If no
                          OID is provided bsnmpwalk will walk the mib2 subtree
                          rooted at
                          .iso(1).org(3).dod(6).internet(1).mgmt(2).mib2(1) .

                          Any of the formats used to print a single variable
                          is valid as input OID:

                          1.3.6.1.2.1.25.1.1.0

                          sysDescr

                          ifPhysAddress.1

                          ifRcvAddressStatus.2.6.255.255.255.255.255.255

                          ifRcvAddressType[2,ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff]

                          ifRcvAddressStatus[Integer:1,OctetString:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff]
                            (requires the -o verbose option)

                          Square brackets are used to denote an entry's
                          indexes.  When used in an input OID, the square
                          brackets may have to be escaped or the OID has to be
                          quoted to protect it from the shell.  Note there is
                          no difference between ifName.1 and "ifName[1]".

     OID=[syntax:]value   The object identifier with its syntax type and value
                          that is to be set.  At least one such string
                          OID=[syntax:]value should be provided to bsnmpset to
                          be able to send a request.

                          OID
                            OID may be input as a string, a string followed by
                            a random number of integers (suboids) separated by
                            dots, a sequence of integers separated by dots -
                            that is if the n option is used - and in such case
                            a syntax is required for every value, or a string
                            followed by square brackets (used to denote an
                            entry's indexes) and corresponding indexes.  Any
                            of the formats used to print a single variable by
                            bsnmpset is valid as input OID as well:

                            1.3.6.1.2.1.25.1.1.0=TimeTicks:537615486

                            sysLocation=OctetString:"@ Home" (with -o verbose
                              option)

                            sysLocation.0="@ Home"

                            1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.6.1=OctetString:ffffffffffff

                            ifPhysAddress.1="00:02:b3:1d:1c:a3"

                            ifRcvAddressStatus.1.6.255.255.255.255.255.255=1

                            ifRcvAddressStatus[Integer:1,OctetString:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff]=Integer:1
                              (with the -o verbose option)

                          syntax
                            where the syntax string is one of: Integer,
                            OctetString, OID, IpAddress, Counter32, Gauge,
                            TimeTicks, Counter64.

                          value
                            The value to be set - IP address in form of
                            u.u.u.u - for example
                            1.3.1.6.1.2.0=IpAddress:192.168.0.1, strings
                            require inverted-commas if they contain any
                            special characters or spaces, all other numeric
                            types do not.

ENVIRONMENT
     bsnmpget, bsnmpwalk and bsnmpset use the following environment variables:

     SNMPAUTH  Specifies a default SNMP USM authentication protocol.

     SNMPPRIV  Specifies a default SNMP USM privacy protocol.

     SNMPUSER  Specifies a default SNMP USM user name.

     SNMPPASSWD
               Specifies the SNMP USM plain text password to use when
               calculating localized authentication and privacy keys.  If this
               variable exists in the environment, SNMPv3 is the default
               version to use for outgoing requests.
