NG_HUB(4)              FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual              NG_HUB(4)

NAME
     ng_hub – packet distribution netgraph node type

SYNOPSIS
     #include <netgraph/ng_hub.h>

DESCRIPTION
     The hub node type provides a simple mechanism for distributing packets
     over several links.  Packets received on any of the hooks are forwarded
     out the other hooks.  Packets are not altered in any way.

HOOKS
     A hub node accepts any request to connect, regardless of the hook name,
     as long as the name is unique.

CONTROL MESSAGES
     This node type supports the generic control messages, plus the following:

     NGM_HUB_SET_PERSISTENT (setpersistent)
          This command sets the persistent flag on the node, and takes no
          arguments.

SHUTDOWN
     This node shuts down upon receipt of a NGM_SHUTDOWN control message, or
     when all hooks have been disconnected.  Setting the persistent flag via a
     NGM_HUB_SET_PERSISTENT control message disables automatic node shutdown
     when the last hook gets disconnected.

SEE ALSO
     netgraph(4), ng_bridge(4), ng_ether(4), ng_one2many(4), ngctl(8),
     nghook(8)

HISTORY
     The ng_hub node type appeared in FreeBSD 5.3.
