Data::Dumper::Perltidy(3)                  User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Data::Dumper::Perltidy - Stringify and pretty print Perl data
       structures.

SYNOPSIS
       Use the Data::Dumper::Perltidy::Dumper() function to stringify and
       pretty print a Perl data structure:

           use Data::Dumper::Perltidy;

           ...

           print Dumper $some_data_structure;

DESCRIPTION
       "Data::Dumper::Perltidy" encapsulates both "Data::Dumper" and
       "Perl::Tidy" to provide a function that stringifies a Perl data
       structure in a pretty printed format. See the documentation for
       Data::Dumper and Perl::Tidy for further information.

       Data::Dumper can be used for, among other things, stringifying complex
       Perl data structures into a format that is suitable for printing and
       debugging.

       Perl::Tidy can be used to pretty print Perl code in a consistent and
       configurable manner.

       Data::Dumper also provides a certain level of pretty printing via the
       $Data::Dumper::Indent variable but it isn't quite as nice as the
       Perl::Tidy output.

       Let's look at an example to see how this module can be used. Say you
       have a complex data structure that you wish to inspect. You can use the
       Data::Dumper::Perltidy::Dumper() function as follows (note that the
       syntax is the same as Data::Dumper):

           #!/usr/bin/perl -w

           use strict;
           use Data::Dumper::Perltidy;

           my $data = [{ title => 'This is a test header' },{ data_range =>
                      [ 0, 0, 3, 9 ] },{ format     => 'bold' }];

           print Dumper $data;

       This would print out:

           $VAR1 = [
               { 'title'      => 'This is a test header' },
               { 'data_range' => [ 0, 0, 3, 9 ] },
               { 'format'     => 'bold' }
           ];

       By comparison the standard Data::Dumper::Dumper() output would be:

           $VAR1 = [
                     {
                       'title' => 'This is a test header'
                     },
                     {
                       'data_range' => [
                                         0,
                                         0,
                                         3,
                                         9
                                       ]
                     },
                     {
                       'format' => 'bold'
                     }
                   ];

       Which isn't too bad but if you are used to Perl::Tidy and the perltidy
       utility you may prefer the Data::Dumper::Perltidy::Dumper() output.

EXPORT
       The only function exported by Data::Dumper::Perltidy is Dumper() and it
       is exported automatically.

FUNCTIONS
   Dumper()
       The Dumper() function takes a list of perl structures and returns a
       stringified and pretty printed form of the values in the list. The
       values will be named $VARn in the output, where "n" is a numeric
       suffix.

       The Data::Dumper $Data::Dumper:: configuration variable can be used to
       influence the output where applicable. For further information see the
       Data::Dumper documentation.

       Note: unlike Data::Dumper::Dumper() this function doesn't currently
       return a list of strings in a list context.

RATIONALE
       I frequently found myself copying the output of Data::Dumper::Dumper()
       into an editor so that I could run "perltidy" on it. This module
       scratches that itch.

LIMITATIONS
       This module doesn't attempt to implement all, or even most, of the
       functionality of "Data::Dumper". In addition, and possibly more
       regrettably, it doesn't give access to the huge array of configuration
       options within "Perl::Tidy".

       Patches, with tests and documentation, are welcome.

       I may also add an option to use Data::Dumper::Names if available.
