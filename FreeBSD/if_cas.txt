CAS(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 CAS(4)

NAME
     cas – Sun Cassini/Cassini+ and National Semiconductor DP83065 Saturn
     Gigabit Ethernet driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device miibus
           device cas

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_cas_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The cas driver provides support for the Sun Cassini/Cassini+ and National
     Semiconductor DP83065 Saturn Gigabit Ethernet controllers found on-board
     in Sun UltraSPARC machines and as add-on cards.

     All controllers supported by the cas driver have TCP/UDP checksum offload
     capability for both receive and transmit, support for the reception and
     transmission of extended frames for vlan(4) and an interrupt
     coalescing/moderation mechanism as well as a 512-bit multicast hash
     filter.

     The cas driver also supports Jumbo Frames (up to 9022 bytes), which can
     be configured via the interface MTU setting.  Selecting an MTU larger
     than 1500 bytes with the ifconfig(8) utility configures the adapter to
     receive and transmit Jumbo Frames.

HARDWARE
     The chips supported by the cas driver are:

     •   National Semiconductor DP83065 Saturn Gigabit Ethernet
     •   Sun Cassini Gigabit Ethernet
     •   Sun Cassini+ Gigabit Ethernet

     The following add-on cards are known to work with the cas driver at this
     time:

     •   Sun GigaSwift Ethernet 1.0 MMF (Cassini Kuheen) (part no. 501-5524)
     •   Sun GigaSwift Ethernet 1.0 UTP (Cassini) (part no. 501-5902)
     •   Sun GigaSwift Ethernet UTP (GCS) (part no. 501-6719)
     •   Sun Quad GigaSwift Ethernet UTP (QGE) (part no. 501-6522)
     •   Sun Quad GigaSwift Ethernet PCI-X (QGE-X) (part no. 501-6738)

SEE ALSO
     altq(4), miibus(4), netintro(4), vlan(4), ifconfig(8)

HISTORY
     The cas device driver appeared in FreeBSD 8.0 and FreeBSD 7.3.  It is
     named after the cas driver which first appeared in OpenBSD 4.1 and
     supports the same set of controllers but is otherwise unrelated.

AUTHORS
     The cas driver was written by Marius Strobl <marius@FreeBSD.org> based on
     the gem(4) driver.
