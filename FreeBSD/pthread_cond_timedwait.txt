PTHREAD_COND_TIMEDWAIT(3)                     FreeBSD Library Functions Manual

NAME
     pthread_cond_timedwait – wait on a condition variable for a specific
     amount of time

LIBRARY
     POSIX Threads Library (libpthread, -lpthread)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <pthread.h>

     int
     pthread_cond_timedwait(pthread_cond_t *cond, pthread_mutex_t *mutex,
         const struct timespec *abstime);

DESCRIPTION
     The pthread_cond_timedwait() function atomically blocks the current
     thread waiting on the condition variable specified by cond, and releases
     the mutex specified by mutex.  The waiting thread unblocks only after
     another thread calls pthread_cond_signal(3), or pthread_cond_broadcast(3)
     with the same condition variable, or if the system time reaches the time
     specified in abstime, and the current thread reacquires the lock on
     mutex.

     The clock used to measure abstime can be specified during creation of the
     condition variable using pthread_condattr_setclock(3).

RETURN VALUES
     If successful, the pthread_cond_timedwait() function will return zero.
     Otherwise an error number will be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     The pthread_cond_timedwait() function will fail if:

     [EINVAL]           The value specified by cond, mutex or abstime is
                        invalid.

     [ETIMEDOUT]        The system time has reached or exceeded the time
                        specified in abstime.

     [EPERM]            The specified mutex was not locked by the calling
                        thread.

STANDARDS
     The pthread_cond_timedwait() function conforms to ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996
     (“POSIX.1”).
