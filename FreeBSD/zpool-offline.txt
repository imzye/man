ZPOOL-OFFLINE(8)        FreeBSD System Manager's Manual       ZPOOL-OFFLINE(8)

NAME
     zpool-offline – take physical devices offline in ZFS storage pool

SYNOPSIS
     zpool offline [-ft] pool device…
     zpool online [-e] pool device…

DESCRIPTION
     zpool offline [-ft] pool device…
             Takes the specified physical device offline.  While the device is
             offline, no attempt is made to read or write to the device.  This
             command is not applicable to spares.

             -f      Force fault.  Instead of offlining the disk, put it into
                     a faulted state.  The fault will persist across imports
                     unless the -t flag was specified.

             -t      Temporary.  Upon reboot, the specified physical device
                     reverts to its previous state.

     zpool online [-e] pool device…
             Brings the specified physical device online.  This command is not
             applicable to spares.

             -e      Expand the device to use all available space.  If the
                     device is part of a mirror or raidz then all devices must
                     be expanded before the new space will become available to
                     the pool.
