VERSION
       version 1.04

SYNOPSIS
           use DateTime::Format::Duration;

           $d = DateTime::Format::Duration->new(
               pattern => '%Y years, %m months, %e days, '.
                       '%H hours, %M minutes, %S seconds'
           );

           print $d->format_duration(
               DateTime::Duration->new(
                   years   => 3,
                   months  => 5,
                   days    => 1,
                   hours   => 6,
                   minutes => 15,
                   seconds => 45,
                   nanoseconds => 12000
               )
           );
           # 3 years, 5 months, 1 days, 6 hours, 15 minutes, 45 seconds


           $duration = $d->parse_duration(
               '3 years, 5 months, 1 days, 6 hours, 15 minutes, 45 seconds'
           );
           # Returns DateTime::Duration object


           print $d->format_duration_from_deltas(
               years   => 3,
               months  => 5,
               days    => 1,
               hours   => 6,
               minutes => 15,
               seconds => 45,
               nanoseconds => 12000
           );
           # 3 years, 5 months, 1 days, 6 hours, 15 minutes, 45 seconds

           %deltas = $d->parse_duration_as_deltas(
                 '3 years, 5 months, 1 days, 6 hours, 15 minutes, 45 seconds'
           );
           # Returns hash:
           # (years=>3, months=>5, days=>1, hours=>6, minutes=>15, seconds=>45)

ABSTRACT
       This module formats and parses DateTime::Duration objects as well as
       other durations representations.

CONSTRUCTOR
       This module contains a single constructor:

       •   new( ... )

           The "new" constructor takes the following attributes:

           •   "pattern => $string"

               This is a strf type pattern detailing the format of the
               duration.  See the "Patterns" sections below for more
               information.

           •   "normalise => $one_or_zero_or_ISO"

           •   "normalize => $one_or_zero_or_ISO"

               This determines whether durations are 'normalised'. For
               example, does 120 seconds become 2 minutes?

               Setting this value to true without also setting a "base" means
               we will normalise without a base. See the "Normalising without
               a base" section below.

           •   "base => $datetime_object"

               If a base DateTime is given then that is the normalisation
               date. Setting this attribute overrides the above option and
               sets normalise to true.

METHODS
       DateTime::Format::Duration has the following methods:

       •   format_duration( $datetime_duration_object )

       •   "format_duration( duration => $dt_duration, pattern => $pattern )"

           Returns a string representing a DateTime::Duration object in the
           format set by the pattern. If the first form is used, the pattern
           is taken from the object. If the object has no pattern then this
           method will croak.

       •   format_duration_from_deltas( %deltas )

       •   "format_duration_from_deltas( %deltas, pattern => $pattern )"

           As above, this method returns a string representing a duration in
           the format set by the pattern. However this method takes a hash of
           values. Permissible hash keys are "years, months, days, hours,
           minutes, seconds" and "nanoseconds" as well as "negative" which, if
           true, inverses the duration. ("years => -1" is the same as "years
           => 1, negative=>1")

       •   parse_duration( $string )

           This method takes a string and returns a DateTime::Duration object
           that is the equivalent according to the pattern.

       •   parse_duration_as_deltas( $string )

           Once again, this method is the same as above, however it returns a
           hash rather than an object.

       •   normalise( $duration_object )

       •   normalize( %deltas )

           Returns a hash of deltas after normalising the input. See the
           "NORMALISE" section below for more information.

ACCESSORS
       •   pattern()

           Returns the current pattern.

       •   base()

           Returns the current base.

       •   normalising()

           Indicates whether or not the durations are being normalised.

SETTERS
       All setters return the object so that they can be strung together.

       •   set_pattern( $new_pattern )

           Sets the pattern and returns the object.

       •   set_base( $new_DateTime )

           Sets the base DateTime and returns the object.

       •   set_normalising( $true_or_false_or_ISO )

           Turns normalising on or off and returns the object.

NOTES
   Patterns
       This module uses a similar set of patterns to strftime. These patterns
       have been kept as close as possible to the original time-based
       patterns.

       •   %C

           The number of hundreds of years in the duration. 400 years would
           return 4.  This is similar to centuries.

       •   %d

           The number of days zero-padded to two digits. 2 days returns 02. 22
           days returns 22 and 220 days returns 220.

       •   %e

           The number of days.

       •   %F

           Equivalent of %Y-%m-%d

       •   %H

           The number of hours zero-padded to two digits.

       •   %I

           Same as %H

       •   %j

           The duration expressed in whole days. 36 hours returns 1

       •   %k

           The hours without any padding

       •   %l

           Same as %k

       •   %m

           The months, zero-padded to two digits

       •   %M

           The minutes, zero-padded to two digits

       •   %n

           A linebreak when formatting and any whitespace when parsing

       •   %N

           Nanoseconds - see note on precision at end

       •   %p

           Either a '+' or a '-' indicating the positiveness of the duration

       •   %P

           A '-' for negative durations and nothing for positive durations.

       •   %r

           Equivalent of %H:%M:%S

       •   %R

           Equivalent of %H:%M

       •   %s

           Returns the value as seconds. 1 day, 5 seconds return 86405

       •   %S

           Returns the seconds, zero-padded to two digits

       •   %t

           A tab character when formatting or any whitespace when parsing

       •   %T

           Equivalent of %P%H:%M:%S

       •   %u

           Days after weeks are removed. 4 days returns 4, but 22 days returns
           1 (22 days is three weeks, 1 day)

       •   %V

           Duration expressed as weeks. 355 days returns 52.

       •   %W

           Duration expressed as floating weeks. 10 days, 12 hours returns 1.5
           weeks.

       •   %y

           Years in the century. 145 years returns 45.

       •   %Y

           Years, zero-padded to four digits

       •   %%

           A '%' symbol

       Precision can be changed for any and all the above values. For all but
       nanoseconds (%N), the precision is the zero-padding. To change the
       precision insert a number between the '%' and the letter. For example:
       1 year formatted with %6Y would return 000001 rather than the default
       0001. Likewise, to remove padding %1Y would just return a 1.

       Nanosecond precision is the other way (nanoseconds are fractional and
       thus should be right padded). 123456789 nanoseconds formatted with %3N
       would return 123 and formatted as %12N would return 123456789000.

   Normalisation
       This module contains a complex method for normalising durations. The
       method ensures that the values for all components are as close to zero
       as possible.  Rather than returning 68 minutes, it is normalised to 1
       hour, 8 minutes.

       The complexity comes from three places:

       •   Mixed positive and negative components

           The duration of 1 day, minus 2 hours is easy to normalise in your
           head to 22 hours. However consider something more complex such as
           -2 years, +1 month, +22 days, +11 hours, -9 minutes.

           This module works from lowest to highest precision to calculate the
           duration.  So, based on a "base" of 2004-03-28T00:00:00 the
           following transformations take place:

               2003-01-01T00:00:00 - 2 years   = 2001-01-01T00:00:00 === -2 years
               2001-01-01T00:00:00 + 1 month   = 2001-02-01T00:00:00 === -1 year, 11 months
               2001-02-01T00:00:00 + 22 days   = 2001-02-23T00:00:00 === -1yr, 10mths, 6days
               2001-02-22T00:00:00 + 11 hours  = 2001-02-23T11:00:00 === -1y, 10m, 6d, 13h
               2001-02-22T11:00:00 - 9 minutes = 2001-02-23T10:51:00 === -1y, 10m, 6d, 13h, 9m
           See: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karenetheridge/DateTime-
           Format-Duration/master/docs/figure1.gif

           Figure 1 illustrates that, with the given base, -2 years, +1 month,
           +22 days, +11 hours, -9 minutes is normalised to -1 year, 10
           months, 6 days, 13 hours and 9 minutes.

       •   Months of unequal length.

           Unfortunately months can have 28, 29, 30 or 31 days and it can
           change from year to year. Thus if I wanted to normalise 2 months it
           could be any of 59 (Feb-Mar), 60 (Feb-Mar in a leap year), 61 (Mar-
           Apr, Apr-May, May-Jun, Jun-Jul, Aug-Sep, Sep-Oct, Oct-Nov or Nov-
           Dec) or 62 days (Dec-Jan or Jul-Aug). Because of this the module
           uses a base datetime for its calculations. If we use the base
           2003-01-01T00:00:00 then two months would be 59 days (2003-03-01 -
           2003-01-01)

       •   The order of components

           Components will always be assessed from lowest to highest precision
           (years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds, nanoseconds). This
           can really change things.

           Consider the duration of 1 day, 24 hours. Normally this will
           normalise to 2 days.  However, consider changes to Daylight
           Savings. On the changes to and from DST days have 25 and 23 hours.

           If we take the base DateTime as midnight on the day DST ends (when
           there's 25 hours in the day), and add 1 day, 24 hours we end up at
           midnight 2 days later.  So our duration normalises to two days.

           However, if we add 24 hours, 1 day we end up at 11pm on the next
           day! Why is this?  Because midnight + 24 hours = 11pm (there's 25
           hours on this day!), then we add 1 day and end up at 11pm on the
           following day.  See:
           https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karenetheridge/DateTime-Format-
           Duration/master/docs/figure2.gif

           Figure 2 illustrates the above problem on timelines.

       •   Leap years and leap seconds

           Leap years and seconds further add to the confusion in
           normalisation. Leap seconds mean there are minutes that are 61
           seconds long, thus 130 seconds can be 2 minutes, 10 seconds or 2
           minutes 9 seconds, depending on the base DateTime.  Similarly leap
           years mean a day can have 23, 24 or 25 hours.  See:
           https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karenetheridge/DateTime-Format-
           Duration/master/docs/figure3.gif

           Figure 3 shows how leaps are calculated on timelines.

   Normalising without a base
       This module includes two ways to normalise without a base.

       •   Standard Normalisation

           Using standard normalisation without a base, 45 days will stay as
           45 days as there is no way to accurately convert to months. However
           the following assumptions will be made: There are 24 hours in a day
           and there are 60 seconds in a minute.

       •   ISO Normalisation

           In ISO8601v2000, Section 5.5.3.2 says that "The values used must
           not exceed the 'carry-over points' of 12 months, 30 days, 24 hours,
           60 minutes and 60 seconds".  Thus if you set the normalise option
           of the constructor, or use set_normalising to 'ISO', months will be
           normalised to 30 days.

   Deltas vs Duration Objects
       This module can bypass duration objects and just work with delta
       hashes.  This used to be of greatest value with earlier versions of
       DateTime::Duration when DateTime::Duration assumed a duration with one
       negative component was a negative duration (that is, -2 hours, 34
       minutes was assumed to be -2 hours, -34 minutes).

       These extra methods have been left in here firstly for backwards-
       compatibility but also as an added 'syntactic sugar'. Consider these
       two equivalent expressions:

           $one = $o->format_duration(
               DateTime::Duration->new(
                   years => -2,
                   days  => 13,
                   hours => -1
               )
           );

           $two = $o->format_duration_from_deltas(
               years => -2,
               days  => 13,
               hours => -1
           );

       These both create the same string in $one and $two, but if you don't
       already have a DateTime::Duration object, the later looks cleaner.
