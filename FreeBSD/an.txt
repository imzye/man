NAME
       an - Anagram generator

SYNOPSIS
       an [-w] [-c string] [-d dictionary] [-l number_words] [-m word_length]
       [-u string] [-n number_anagrams] [-h] [-v] [--words] [--contain string]
       [--dict dictionary] [--length number_words] [--minimum word_length]
       [--used string] [--number number_anagrams] [--help] [--version] PHRASE

DESCRIPTION
       an finds all anagrams which can be made from the letters in PHRASE,
       using words in the specified dictionary. The default is to use
       /usr/share/dict/words.

OPTIONS
       -w, --words
              Print words that the letters in PHRASE can make, then exit.

       -c, --contain string
              Only print anagrams which contain string.


       -d, --dict dictionary
              Use dictionary file to find words which the letters in PHRASE
              can make.


       -m, --minimum word_length
              Only include word which are at least word_length long.



       -u, --used string
              Considers that letters in string have already used when
              analyzing letters in PHRASE.  Like --contain but doesn't print
              out string.


       -l, --length number_words
              Finds anagrams which have a maximum of number_words words in
              them.  This is very useful when number of anagrams which are
              output is large.


       -n, --number number_anagrams
              Stops after finding number_anagrams anagrams.


       -h, --help
              Print a usage message on standard output, then exit.


       -v, --version
              Print version information on standard output, then exit.
