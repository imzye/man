NAME
     basicdsp – DSP demonstration program

SYNOPSIS
     A program for experimenting with simple audio DSP algorithms.

DESCRIPTION
     BasicDSP is a program to apply simple Digital Signal Processing
     algorithms to audio signals. The input can either be taken from the sound
     card, or be a locally generated sine wave, white noise or impulse signal.
     The output is fed to the sound card, as well as to a virtual oscilloscope
     and spectrum analyzer.

     The DSP algorithm itself is specified in a very straightforward
     programming language which has only assignment statements (and on unix a
     print statement).  Each line contains one statement, and all lines are
     executed once for each incoming sample. The input sample is available in
     variables named 'in', output into variables named 'out', 'outl' and/or
     'outr'.  Here's a simple example program:

       a = a + slider1 * (in - a)
       outl = a
       outr = fir(in, 0.1, 0.3, 0.3, 0.1)

     This illustrates defining new variables ('a' in the example), the use of
     the sliders, and the use of a built-in function like fir().  The help-
     menu gives access to a complete list of built-in variables and functions.

     Note: the program was originally written to accompany a series of
     articles on Software-Defined Radio appearing in the Dutch amateur radio
     journal ´Electron´. Another tutorial appeared in the December 2007 issue
     of SPRAT.
