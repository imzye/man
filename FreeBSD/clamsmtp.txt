clamsmtpd.conf(5)         FreeBSD File Formats Manual        clamsmtpd.conf(5)

NAME
     clamsmtpd.conf – the configuration file for clamsmtpd(8)

DESCRIPTION
     clamsmtpd(8) reads a configuration file when starting up. The location of
     the file is dependent on how you compiled clamsmtp but it should usually
     be in either the /usr/local/etc/ or /etc/ directories. If clamsmtpd(8)
     does not find its configuration file it'll print a warning when it starts
     up along with the location it's expecting to find it in. You can also
     specify a different location for a config file by passing the -f argument
     to clamsmtpd(8)

     The settings are specified one per line. The setting names come first,
     followed by a colon and then the value. Comments start with the '#'
     character on a line of their own. Whitespace is ignored at the beginning
     of line, end of line and around the colons.

     A sample configuration file can be found in the doc/ directory of the
     clamsmtp distribution.

SETTINGS
     The various settings are as follows:

     Action      This option controls what clamsmtpd(8) does when it finds a
                 virus. The options are:

                 bounce Bounce the email. In most cases this is not a good
                 idea since many viruses spoof sender addresses.

                 drop Silently drop the email. Recommended.

                 pass Pass on the email. Inserts an 'X-Virus-Infected' header.

                 [ Default: drop ]

     ClamAddress
                 Specifies the address to connect to clamd(8) on. See syntax
                 of addresses below.

                 [ Default: /var/run/clamav/clamd.sock ]

     Header      A header to add to scanned messages. Put an empty value to
                 suppress adding a header. You can include the following
                 special formatting characters in the string to include
                 special values:

                 %i Client IP Address

                 %l Local IP Address

                 %d Current Date

                 You can also include the standard \r or \n escapes.

                 [ Default: 'X-Virus-Scanned: ClamAV using ClamSMTP' ]

     KeepAlives  On slow connections the server will sometimes timeout before
                 clamsmtpd(8) is finished scanning the file. This option sends
                 NOOP's to the server to keep the connection alive. Specify
                 the number of seconds, or 0 to disable.

                 [ Default: 0 ]

     Listen      The address and port to listen for SMTP connections on. See
                 syntax of addresses below.

                 [ Default: port 10025 on all local IP addresses ]

     PidFile     Specifies a location for the a process id file to be written
                 to. This file contains the process id of clamsmtpd.conf and
                 can be used to stop the daemon. If the -p argument is passed
                 on the command line, then this setting will be ignored.

                 [ Default: none ]

     Quarantine  Quarantine files that contain viruses by leaving them in the
                 TempDirectory directory. The file names look like this (where
                 X is a random character or number): virus.XXXXXX

                 [ Default: off ]

     MaxConnections
                 Specifies the maximum number of connections to accept at
                 once.  clamd(8) also needs to be setup to accept at least
                 this number of connections.

                 [ Default: 64 ]

     OutAddress  The address of the SMTP server to send email to once it's
                 been scanned. See syntax of addreses below.

                 [ Required ]

     TempDirectory
                 The directory to write temp files to. This directory needs to
                 be accessible to both clamd(8) and clamsmtpd(8)

                 [ Default: /tmp ]

     TimeOut     The number of seconds to wait while reading data from network
                 connections.

                 [ Default: 180 seconds ]

     TransparentProxy
                 This option enables transparent proxy support, which allows
                 you to route all SMTP traffic that's going through a gateway
                 through clamsmtp which will then send it on to its final
                 destination. This setup usually involves firewall rules which
                 redirect traffic to clamsmtp, and the setup varies from OS to
                 OS.

                 [ Default: off ]

     User        The user to run as. If this option is specified then
                 clamsmtpd(8) must be started as root. It will then drop root
                 privileges and run as the specified user. The user can either
                 be a name or a numerical user id.

                 [ Optional ]

     VirusAction
                 This is a command to run when a virus is found. See the VIRUS
                 ACTION section in clamsmtpd(8) for a discussion of this
                 option.

                 [ Default: off ]

     XClient     Send an XCLIENT command to the receiving server. This is
                 useful for forwarding client addresses and connection info to
                 servers that support this feature.

                 [ Default: off ]

ADDRESSES
     Addresses can be specified in multiple formats:

     •   Unix local addresses can be specified by specifying their full path.
         (ie: '/var/run/clamav/clamd.sock').

     •   IP addresses can be specified using dotted notation with a colon
         before the port number (ie: '127.0.0.1:3310').

     •   IPv6 addresses are implemented but disabled. The code needs testing.
