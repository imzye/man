IICHID(4)              FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual              IICHID(4)

NAME
     iichid – I2C HID transport driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device iichid

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           iichid_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The iichid driver provides a interface to I2C Human Interface Devices
     (HIDs).

SYSCTL VARIABLES
     Next parameters are available as sysctl(8) variables.  Debug parameter is
     available as loader(8) tunable as well.

     dev.iichid.*.sampling_rate_fast
             Active sampling rate in num/second (for sampling mode).

     dev.iichid.*.sampling_rate_slow
             Idle sampling rate in num/second (for sampling mode).

     dev.iichid.*.sampling_hysteresis
             Number of missing samples before enabling of slow mode (for
             sampling mode).

     hw.iichid.debug
             Debug output level, where 0 is debugging disabled and larger
             values increase debug message verbosity.  Default is 0.

SEE ALSO
     ig4(4)

BUGS
     The iichid does not support GPIO interrupts yet.  In that case iichid
     enables sampling mode with periodic polling of hardware by driver means.
     See dev.iichid.*.sampling_* sysctl(4) variables for tuning of sampling
     parameters.

HISTORY
     The iichid driver first appeared in FreeBSD 13.0.
