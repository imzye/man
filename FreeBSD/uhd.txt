       -b GRC_BLOCKS, --grc-blocks GRC_BLOCKS
              Path to directory of GRC block descriptions (needed for
              --grc-config only)

              Just generate files without building the FPGA

       -W, --ignore-warnings
              Run build even when there are warnings in the build process.

       -S SECURE_CORE, --secure-core SECURE_CORE
              Build a secure image core instead of a bitfile. This argument
              provides the name of the generated YAML.

       -K SECURE_KEY, --secure-key SECURE_KEY
              Path to encryption key file to use for secure core.

              n320, x410, x440]. Needs to be specified either here, or in the
              configuration file.

              either here, on the configuration file.

       -g, --GUI
              Open Vivado GUI during the FPGA building process.

       -Y, --SYNTH
              Stop the FPGA build process after Synthesis.

              Run elaboration only to check HDL syntax.

       -s, --save-project
              Save Vivado project to disk.

       -P, --ip-only
              Build only the required IPs.

       -j JOBS, --jobs JOBS
              Number of parallel jobs to use with make.

       -c, --clean-all
              Cleans the IP before a new build.

       -p VIVADO_PATH, --vivado-path VIVADO_PATH
              Path to the base install for Xilinx Vivado if not in default
              location (e.g., /tools/Xilinx/Vivado).

       -H, --no-hash
              Do not include source YAML hash in the generated source code.

       -D, --no-date
              Do not include date or time in the generated source code.

       --color {never,auto,always}
              Enable colorful output. When set to 'auto' will only show color
              output in TTY environments (e.g., interactive shells).

DESCRIPTION
       This tool takes a YAML configuration file and generates an FPGA bitfile
       that can be used with an RFNoC-capable UHD device. The YAML
       configuration file describes the RFNoC blocks that are to be included
       in the FPGA image, along with the connections between the blocks, and
       any additional configuration that is required for the blocks.
