NAME
       doctorj - Javadoc analyzer and spell-checker

SYNOPSIS
       doctorj [--emacs] [--level=LEVEL] [--warning=LEVEL] [--tabwidth=NUM]
               [--dictionaries=LIST] [--source=VERSION] [--verbose] {FILE...}


DESCRIPTION
       doctorj is an application to analyze Javadoc comments against Java
       code, verifying its integrity and format. It also spell-checks Javadoc
       comments.


OPTIONS
       --emacs
              Whether to list violations in Emacs form, i.e., a single line of
              the form:

              8:48:9:4: An error occurred on this line.

              By default, violations are displayed in ``long form'', showing
              the context.


       --level=LEVEL
              Sets the warning/error level. A level of 0 will result in only
              errors reported. A level of 1 means that Javadoc for public and
              abstract items (classes, interfaces, methods, constructors, and
              fields) will be checked. A level of 2 will result in the
              addition of checking of protected-access items; 3 is for
              package-access items, and 4 will check all items. The default is
              4.


       --warning=LEVEL
              This is the same as --level; it exists for backward
              compatibility, and is deprecated.


       --tabwidth=NUM
              Sets the number of spaces to use for alignment with tabs. By
              default, this value is 4.


       --dictionaries=LIST
              Sets the dictionaries (word lists) to use for spell-checking.
              LIST is a comma-delimited string of paths to the word list
              files. By default, doctorj uses the word list at
              /usr/share/doctorj/words.LOCALE, where LOCALE is of the standard
              Java form. doctorj is distributed with three word lists:
              words.en_CA (Canadian English), words.en_UK (United Kingdom
              English), and words.en_US (United States English).


       --verbose
              Produces debugging output. Note that this signficantly impedes
              performance.


       --source=VERSION
              Sets the source version, which is used to determine the type of
              grammar with which to parse the input files. VERSION may be 1.3,
              1.4, or 1.5. The default is 1.4.


       FILE   Specifies the files to check. If the argument specified is a
              directory, all files ending in ``.java'' under that directory
              will be analyzed.


EXAMPLES
       To check a single file:


              % doctorj String.java


       To check multiple files:


              % doctorj String.java StringBuffer.java Object.java


       To check all files below a directory:


              % doctorj /proj/app/src


       To run at the maximum warning level:


              % doctorj --warning=4 .


       To specify a different dictionary:


              % doctorj --dictionaries=/usr/share/dict/words .


CONFIGURATION
       $HOME/.doctorjrc


       The run-control file, of the form:



                  emacs: true
                  warning: 4
                  tabwidth: 8
                  dictionaries: /usr/share/dict/words,/home/me/etc/terms
                  verbose: false



       Dictionary (word list) files contain one word per line, for example:





                  adaxial
                  cepaceous
                  sabaton
                  vespiaries
                  eujifferous
