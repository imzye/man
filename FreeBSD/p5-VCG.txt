NAME
       VCG - Interface to the VCG graphing tool

SYNOPSIS
         use VCG;
         my $vcg = VCG->new(outfile=>'resulta.vcg');
         $vcg->add_node(title => 'aaa');
         $vcg->add_node(title => 'bbb', label='b');
         $vcg->add_node(title => 'ccc', color=>'yellow');

         $vcg->add_edge(source => 'aaa', target=>'bbb');

         $vcg->output_as_pbm('mygraph.pbm');

         $vcg->output_as_ps(filename=>'mygraph.ps');

         my $data = $vcg->as_ppm();
         open (OUTFILE, 'outfile.ppm') or die "error $!\n";
         print OUTFILE $data;
         close OUTFILE;

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides an interface to to the vcg graphing tool. It
       supports a limited selection of options and file formats. The vcg
       graphing tool homepage is currently
       http://rw4.cs.uni-sb.de/users/sander/html/gsvcg1.html but is being
       actively developed elsewhere.

       This module is based on Leon Brocard's GraphViz module, it tries to
       provide a similar interface to offer some sense of consistency.

       VCG is now in active development and although Graph::Writer::VCG
       already exists, this module provides a similar interface to graphviz
       and will be more closely tied into vcg as it becomes more actively
       developed - see James Micheal DuPont's announcement at
       http://mail.gnome.org/archives/dia-list/2003-February/msg00029.html.

METHODS
   new
       new objects are created using the constructor method 'new'.

       This method accepts name attributes in the form :

       my $vcg = VCG->new(outfile=>'foo.pbm')

       my $vcg = VCG->new(title=>'Dia Dependancies Diagram',debug=>1);

       my $vcg = VCG->new();

       my %config = ( xmax => 700, ymax=>700, program=>'xvcg', x=>30, y=>30 );
       my $vcg = VCG->new(%config);

       my $vcg = VCG->new( outfile=>'diagram.ps', landscape=>1,
       paper=>'tabloid', spline=>1 );

   add_edge
       add_edge allows you to add edges to your vcg object (edges are the
       lines or relationships between nodes).

       In a Finite State Diagram, edges would represent transitions between
       states.

       This method accepts the source, target and colour of the edge :

       $vcg->add_edge( source=>'from_node', target=>'to_node');

       $vcg->add_edge( source=>'aaa', target=>'bbb', color=>'grey');

   add_node
       add_node allows you to add nodes to your vcg object (nodes are the
       things connected, while edges are the connections).

       In a Finite State Diagram, nodes would be the individual states.

       This method accepts the label, title and background colour of the node
       :

       $vcg->add_node( title=>'aaa' );

       $vcg->add_node( label=>'aaa' );

       $vcg->add_node( label=>'aaa', title=>'A', color=>'yellow' );

   get_vcg_version
       You can get the version and copyright message as a string using the vcg
       object (requires vcg be installed)

       my $version = $vcg->get_vcg_version() or die "couldn't get version :
       $vcg->error() \n";

   as_ps, as_pbm, as_ppm, as_vcg, as_plainvcg
       The VCG object allows you to access the output of the vcg tool
       directly, suitable for using with graphic libraries - although some
       libraries or older versions may not be able to cope with these formats.

       You can access the output in any of postscript, pbm, ppm, vcg
       (annotated) and vcg (plain) :

       my $image_as_ppm = $vcg->as_ppm(); # string of image as formatted as
       ppm

       my $vcg_with_coords = $vcg->as_vcg(); # handy for building a pixmap or
       something or converting to dia xml for example

   output_as_ps, output_as_pbm, output_as_ppm
       The VCG object allows you to output straight to a file through the vcg
       tool in any of postscript, pbm and ppm. This functionality requires
       that the vcg tool be installed.

       $vcg->output_as_ps('my_diagram.ps'); # now open the file in the gimp or
       import into LaTeX and you can get this free Mad Scientist (TM) white
       coat and bunsen burner.

   output_as_vcg, output_as_plainvcg
       The VCG object also allows you to output straight to file in annotated
       vcg with coordinates, or plain vcg syntax. The plain syntax does not
       require the vcg tool to be installed.

       $vcg->output_as_plainvcg('compiler_graph.vcg'); # just in case you want
       to generate a diagram but don't have vcg installed.

       $vcg->output_as_vcg('compiler_graph_with_coords.vcg'); # lovely jubbly
