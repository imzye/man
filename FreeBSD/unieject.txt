DESCRIPTION

       unieject is a simple commandline tool that allows to eject, close the
       tray, set the speed, lock and unlock a CD-Rom drive. The main
       difference from the usual eject tool you find in many distributions is
       that it uses libcdio and its then portable on non-Linux operating
       system, as far as libcdio is ported, too.
ACTIONS

       The default action is, of course, to eject the CD in the drive, but
       there are a few extra actions that are present, mainly for
       compatibility with classic eject command.

       --trayclose, -t
           Close the tray of the drive instead of ejecting the CD in it.

       --traytoggle, -T
           If the tray is closed, eject, if it´s open, close the tray. This
           function relies on the drive being able to provide the tray
           information.

       --speed speed, -x speed
           Set the maximum speed for the CD-Rom drive, if applicable.

       --lock, -l, --unlock, -L
           Allows to lock or unlock the tray of the CD-Rom drive to disable
           and then re-enable the manual eject by button.
COMMON OPTIONS

       --noop, -n
           Don´t actually do anything, just print what it would have been done
           to execute the required command.

       --verbose, -V
           Show more information while executing the command (increase
           verbosity).

       --quiet, -Q
           Hides error while executing the command (decrease verbosity).

       --ignore-caps
           Ignore the capabilities stated by the device to eject, and try to
           run the command anyway, useful if a device is known not to report
           them correctly. On FreeBSD systems this is forced while using ioctl
           access.

       --no-ignore-caps
           Don´t ignore the capabilities stated by the device (this is the
           default behavior, this option is used to override unieject.conf(5)
           file).

       --accessmode mode
           Change the default access mode for the command. This is used to
           override the default access mode imposed by libcdio in case it
           doesn´t work correctly. Leave the default if you don´t know how to
           change this.

       --debugcdio level
           Sets the debug level for libcdio information messages.  0 means the
           most debug output is generated.
EJECTION OPTIONS

       --no-unmount, -m
           Don´t unmount the device if it´s mounted (eject will fail if the
           device is mounted).

       --unmount, -u
           Unmount the device if it´s mounted (this is the default behavior,
           this option is used to override unieject.conf(5) file).

       --force, -f
           Force unmounting of the device if it´s mounted, this works only if
           the operating system supports it.

       --no-force
           Don´t force unmounting of device (this is the default behavior,
           this option is used to override unieject.conf(5) file).

       --umount-wrapper wrapper, -W wrapper
           Use the given wrapper to unmount the device instead of library´s
           functions. The device name will be passed right after the wrapper.
ENVIRONMENT

       The following environment variables changes the behavior of unieject.

       EJECT
           Used for compatibility with FreeBSD´s eject command; when it´s set
           the default device to eject is take from there instead of libcdio
           defaults.
