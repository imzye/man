NAME
       Tk::Sugar - Sugar syntax for Tk

VERSION
       version 1.093190

SYNOPSIS
           use Tk::Sugar qw{ :pack :state };

           $widget->pack( top, xfill2, pad10 );
           # equivalent to those pack options:
           #     -side   => 'top'
           #     -expand => 1
           #     -fill   => 'both'
           #     -padx   => 10
           #     -pady   => 10

           $widget->configure( enabled );
           # equivalent to: -state => 'enabled'

DESCRIPTION
       Tk is a great graphical toolkit to write desktop applications.
       However, one can get bothered with the constant typing of quotes and
       options. Tk::Sugar provides handy subs for common options used when
       programming Tk.

       Benefits are obvious:

       •   Reduced typing.

           The constant need to type "=>" and '' is fine for one-off cases,
           but the instant you start using Tk it starts to get annoying.

       •   More compact statements.

           Reduces much of the redundant typing in most cases, which makes
           your life easier, and makes it take up less visual space, which
           makes it faster to read.

       •   No string worries.

           Strings are often problematic, since they aren't checked at
           compile- time. Sometimes it makes spotting an error a difficult
           task. Using this alleviates that worry.

EXPORTS
       This module is using Sub::Exporter underneath, so you can use all its
       shenanigans to change the export names.

   Exported subs
       Look below for the list of available subs.

       Pack options

       Traditional packer sides (available as ":side" export group):

       •   top - equivalent to "( -side => 'top' )"

       •   bottom - ditto for "bottom"

       •   left - ditto for "left"

       •   right - ditto for "right"

       Packer expand and filling (available as ":fill" export group):

       •   fillx - equivalent to "( -fill => 'x' )"

       •   filly - equivalent to "( -fill => 'y' )"

       •   fill2 - equivalent to "( -fill => 'both' )"

       •   xfillx - same as "fillx" with "( -expand => 1 )"

       •   xfilly - ditto for "filly"

       •   xfill2 - ditto for "fill2"

       •   expand - equivalent to "( -expand => 1 )" if you don't like the
           "xfill*" notation

       Packer padding (available as ":pad" export group):

       •   pad1 - equivalent to "( -padx => 1, -pady => 1 )"

       •   pad2 - ditto with 2 pixels

       •   pad5 - ditto with 5 pixels

       •   pad10 - ditto with 10 pixels

       •   pad20 - ditto with 20 pixels

       •   pad($n) - ditto with $n pixels (function call with one argument)

       •   padx($n) - x padding with $n pixels (function call with one
           argument)

       •   pady($n) - y padding with $n pixels (function call with one
           argument)

       Packer padding (available as ":ipad" export group):

       •   ipad1 - equivalent to "( -ipadx => 1, -ipady => 1 )"

       •   ipad2 - ditto with 2 pixels

       •   ipad5 - ditto with 5 pixels

       •   ipad10 - ditto with 10 pixels

       •   ipad20 - ditto with 20 pixels

       •   ipad($n) - ditto with $n pixels (function call with one argument)

       •   ipadx($n) - internal x padding with $n pixels (function call with
           one argument)

       •   ipady($n) - internal y padding with $n pixels (function call with
           one argument)

       Common options

       Widget state (available as ":state" export group):

       •   enabled - equivalent to "( -state => 'normal' )"

       •   disabled - ditto for "disabled"

       Widget anchor (available as ":anchor" export group). Note that those
       subs are upper case, otherwise the sub "s" would clash with the regex
       substitution:

       •   N - equivalent to "( -anchor => 'n' )"

       •   S - ditto with "s"

       •   E - ditto with "e"

       •   W - ditto with "w"

       •   C - ditto with "center"

       •   NE - ditto with "ne"

       •   NW - ditto with "nw"

       •   SE - ditto with "se"

       •   SW - ditto with "sw"

       Widget orientation (available as ":orient" export group).:

       •   horizontal - equivalent to "( -orient => 'horizontal' )"

       •   vertical - ditto with "vertical"

   Export groups
       Beside the individual groups outlined above, the following export
       groups exist for your convenience:

       :default
           This exports all existing subs.

       :pack
           This exports subs related to Tk::pack options. Same as ":side",
           ":fill", ":pad" and ":ipad".

       :options
           This exports subs related to widget configure options. Same as
           ":state", ":anchor" and ":orient".
