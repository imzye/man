NAME
       lmdb - an interface to the Lightning Memory-Mapped Database (LMDB)

SYNOPSIS
       lmdb version
       lmdb env
       lmdb open

DESCRIPTION
       LMDB is a Btree-based database management library with an API similar
       to BerkeleyDB. The library is thread-aware and supports concurrent
       read/write access from multiple processes and threads. The DB structure
       is multi-versioned, and data pages use a copy-on-write strategy, which
       also provides resistance to corruption and eliminates the need for any
       recovery procedures. The database is exposed in a memory map, requiring
       no page cache layer of its own.

       This extension provides an easy to use interface for accessing LMDB
       database files from Tcl.
