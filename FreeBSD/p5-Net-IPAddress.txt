NAME
       Net::IPAddress - Functions used to manipulate IP addresses, masks and
       FQDN's.

SYNOPSIS
       use Net::IPAddress;

       @ISA = qw(Net::IPAddress);

DESCRIPTION
       "Net::IPAddr" is a collection of helpful functions used to convert IP
       addresses to/from 32-bit integers, applying subnet masks to IP
       addresses, validating IP address strings, and splitting a FQDN into its
       host and domain parts.

       No rocket science here, but I have found these functions to very, very
       handy.  For example, have you ever tried to sort a list of IP addresses
       only to find out that they don't sort the way you expected?  Here is
       the solution!  If you convert the IP addresses to 32-bit integer
       addresses, they will sort in correct order.

       ip2num( STRING )
           Returns the 32-bit integer of the passed IP address string.

           "$ipnum = ip2num("10.1.1.1");" $ipnum is 167837953.

       num2ip( INTEGER )
           Returns the IP address string of the passed 32-bit IP address.

           "$IP = num2ip(167837953);" $IP is "10.1.1.1".

       validaddr( STRING )
           Returns true (1) if the IP address string is a valid and properly
           formatted IP address, and false (0) otherwise.

           "$valid = validaddr("10.1.2.1");"  # returns true

           "$valid = validaddr("10.1.2.");"   # returns false!

           If you have your own IP address validator, try the last one.  Most
           will incorrectly compute that as a valid address.

       mask( IPADDRESS, MASK )
           Returns the result of binary (IPADDRESS & MASK).  IPADDRESS can be
           either an IP address string or a 32-bit integer address. MASK can
           be either an IP address string, or the number of bits in the mask.
           The returned value will be in the same format as the passed IP
           address.  If you pass an IP address string, then an IP address
           string is returned, if you pass a 32-bit integer address then a
           32-bit integer address is returned.

           Examples

             "$subnet = mask("10.96.3.2",16);" # $subnet = "10.96.0.0"

             "$subnet = mask("10.21.4.22","255.240.0.0");"
             # $subnet = "10.16.0.0"

             "$subnet = mask(167837953,"255.255.255.0");"
             # $subnet = 167837952>

           This function, when used with the others, is very useful for
           computing IP addresses.  For example, you need to add another
           server to a subnet that an existing server is on.  You want the new
           server to be the ".17" address of a /24 subnet. This is done easily
           in the following example:

             "use Net::IPAddress"

             "$server = "10.8.9.12";" "$newserver = num2ip(ip2num(mask($server,24)) + 17);" "print "New server IP is $newserver\n";"

             "New server IP is 10.8.9.17"

             The following code does exactly the same thing:

             "use Net::IPAddress;"

             "$server = "10.8.9.12";" "$newserver = num2ip(mask(ip2num($server),24) + 17);" "print "New server IP is $newserver\n";"

       fqdn( FQDN )
           This function returns the host and domain of the passed FQDN (fully
           qualified domain name).

           "($host,$domain) = fqdn("www.cpan.perl.org");"
           # $host = "www", $domain = "cpan.perl.org"

EXPORTS
       "Net::IPAddress" exports five functions "ip2num", "num2ip",
       "validaddr", "mask", and "fqdn".
