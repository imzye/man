SIBA(4)                FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                SIBA(4)

NAME
     siba – Sonic Inc. Silicon Backplane driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, add the following lines to the
     kernel configuration file:

           device bhnd
           device siba

     To load the driver as a module at boot, add this line to loader.conf(5):

           siba_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The siba driver provides bhnd(4) support for devices based on the Sonic
     Inc. Silicon Backplane, an interblock communications architecture found
     in earlier Broadcom Home Networking Division wireless chipsets and
     embedded systems.

     A common interconnect connects all of the Silicon Backplane's functional
     blocks.  These functional blocks, known as cores, use the Open Core
     Protocol (OCP) interface to communicate with agents attached to the
     Silicon Backplane.

     Each core can have an initiator agent that passes read and write requests
     onto the system backplane and a target agent that returns responses to
     those requests.  Not all cores contain both an initiator and a target
     agent.  Initiator agents are present in cores that contain host
     interfaces (PCI, PCMCIA), embedded processors (MIPS), or DMA processors
     associated with communications cores.

HISTORY
     The siba device driver first appeared in FreeBSD 8.0.  The driver was
     rewritten for FreeBSD 11.0 to support the common Broadcom bhnd(4) bus
     interface.

AUTHORS
     The siba driver was originally written by Bruce M. Simpson
     <bms@FreeBSD.org> and Weongyo Jeong <weongyo@FreeBSD.org>.  The driver
     was rewritten for FreeBSD 11.0 by Landon Fuller <landonf@FreeBSD.org>.
