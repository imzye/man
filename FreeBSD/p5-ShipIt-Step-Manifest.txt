ShipIt::Step::Manifest(3)                  User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       ShipIt::Step::Manifest - ShipIt step for recreating the MANIFEST

SYNOPSIS
       None.

DESCRIPTION
       This step recreates the MANIFEST by effectively running "make
       manifest", or the equivalent in your build process.

       I use this as I don't have superfluous files lying around in the
       distribution directories, and have set the relevant "svk ignore"
       properties.

       To use it, just list in your ".shipit" file.
