PTHREAD_DETACH(3)      FreeBSD Library Functions Manual      PTHREAD_DETACH(3)

NAME
     pthread_detach – detach a thread

LIBRARY
     POSIX Threads Library (libpthread, -lpthread)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <pthread.h>

     int
     pthread_detach(pthread_t thread);

DESCRIPTION
     The pthread_detach() function is used to indicate to the implementation
     that storage for the thread thread can be reclaimed when the thread
     terminates.  If thread has not terminated, pthread_detach() will not
     cause it to terminate.  The effect of multiple pthread_detach() calls on
     the same target thread is unspecified.

RETURN VALUES
     If successful, the pthread_detach() function will return zero.  Otherwise
     an error number will be returned to indicate the error.  Note that the
     function does not change the value of errno as it did for some drafts of
     the standard.  These early drafts also passed a pointer to pthread_t as
     the argument.  Beware!

ERRORS
     The pthread_detach() function will fail if:

     [EINVAL]           The implementation has detected that the value
                        specified by thread does not refer to a joinable
                        thread.

     [ESRCH]            No thread could be found corresponding to that
                        specified by the given thread ID, thread.

SEE ALSO
     pthread_join(3)

STANDARDS
     The pthread_detach() function conforms to ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996
     (“POSIX.1”).
