Encode::MIME::EncWords(3)                  User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Encode::MIME::EncWords -- MIME 'B' and 'Q' header encoding
       (alternative)

SYNOPSIS
           use Encode::MIME::EncWords;
           use Encode qw/encode decode/;

           # decode header:
           $utf8   = decode('MIME-EncWords', $header);

           # encode header with default charset, UTF-8:
           $header = encode('MIME-EncWords', $utf8);

           # encode header with another charset:
           Encode::MIME::EncWords->config(Charset => 'GB2312');
           $header = encode('MIME-EncWords', $utf8);

ABSTRACT
       This module implements MIME header encoding described in RFC 2047.
       There are three variant encoding names and one shorthand special to a
       charset:

         Encoding name              Result of encode()     Comment
         -------------------------------------------------------------------
         MIME-EncWords              (auto-detect B or Q)
         MIME-EncWords-B            =?XXXX?B?...?=         Default is UTF-8.
         MIME-EncWords-Q            =?XXXX?Q?...?=                ,,
         MIME-EncWords-ISO_2022_JP  =?ISO-2022-JP?B?...?=

       All encodings generate the same result by decode().

DESCRIPTION
       This module is intended to be an alternative of "MIME-*" encodings
       provided by Encode::MIME::Header core module.  To find out how to use
       this module in detail, see Encode.

   Module specific feature
       config(KEY => VALUE, ...);
           Class method. Set options by KEY => VALUE pairs.  Following options
           are available.

           Charset
               [encode] Name of character set by which data elements will be
               converted.  Default is "UTF-8".  On "MIME-EncWords-ISO_2022_JP"
               it is fixed to "ISO-2022-JP".

           Detect7bit
               [decode/encode] Try to detect 7-bit charset on unencoded
               portions.  Default is "YES".

           Field
               [encode] Name of the header field which will be considered on
               the first line of encoded result in its length.  Default is
               "undef".

           Mapping
               [decode/encode] Specify mappings actually used for charset
               names.  Default is "EXTENDED".

           MaxLineLen
               [encode] Maximum line length excluding newline.  Default is 76.

           Minimal
               [encode] Whether to do minimal encoding or not.  Default is
               "YES".

           For more details about options see MIME::EncWords.

CAVEAT
       •   The encoding modules for MIME header encoding are not the magic
           porridge pot to cook complex header fields properly.

           To decode address header fields (From:, To:, ...), at first parse
           mailbox-list; then decode each element by encoding module.  To
           encode them, at first encode each element by encoding module; then
           construct mailbox-list of encoded elements.  To construct or parse
           mailbox-list, some modules such as Mail::Address may be used.

       •   Lines are delimited with LF ("\n").  RFC5322 states that lines in
           Internet messages are delimited with CRLF ("\r\n").
