EMAILRELAY-FILTER-COPY(1)                      FreeBSD General Commands Manual

NAME
       emailrelay-filter-copy - an E-MailRelay filter for pop-by-name

SYNOPSIS
       emailrelay-filter-copy <emailrelay-content-file>

       emailrelay-filter-copy [--help]

DESCRIPTION
       The emailrelay-filter-copy utility can be used as an E-MailRelay
       --filter pre-processor program to copy e-mail messages from the main
       spool directory into all available sub-directories. When using the
       --pop-by-name feature of the E-MailRelay server this results in
       messages being copied to all POP clients.

       Only the message envelope is copied; the content file stays in the main
       directory.
