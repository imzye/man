NAME
       rsfetch - a blazingly fast fetch program for Linux and *BSD.

SYNOPSIS
       rsfetch --<info field> --<info field> [--help]

DESCRIPTION
       rsfetch is a fast, somwhat(?) minimal information utility written in
       Rust, similar to Neofetch or ufetch. It currently supports Linux and
       (Open|Net|Free)BSD. All information fields are disabled by default, and
       must be manually enabled via configuration flags.

       rsfetch has no configuration file, making it even more fast. Users may
       instead create aliases in their ~/.${SHELL}rc.

       In addition, no automatic package manager or ASCII logo mechanism is
       present, but must instead be manually specified.

       rsfetch currently supports the "pacman", "apt", "xbps", "dnf", "pkg",
       "eopkg", "rpm", "apk", "pip" "portage", and "cargo" package managers.
