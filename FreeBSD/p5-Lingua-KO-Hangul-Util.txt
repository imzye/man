DESCRIPTION
       A Hangul syllable consists of Hangul jamo (Hangul letters).

       Hangul letters are classified into three classes:

         CHOSEONG  (the initial sound) as a leading consonant (L),
         JUNGSEONG (the medial sound)  as a vowel (V),
         JONGSEONG (the final sound)   as a trailing consonant (T).

       Any Hangul syllable is a composition of (i) L + V, or (ii) L + V + T.

   Composition and Decomposition
       "$resultant_string = decomposeSyllable($string)"
           It decomposes a precomposed syllable ("LV" or "LVT") to a sequence
           of conjoining jamo ("L + V" or "L + V + T") and returns the result
           as a string.

           Any characters other than Hangul syllables are not affected.

       "$resultant_string = composeSyllable($string)"
           It composes a sequence of conjoining jamo ("L + V" or "L + V + T")
           to a precomposed syllable ("LV" or "LVT") if possible, and returns
           the result as a string.  A syllable "LV" and final jamo "T" are
           also composed.

           Any characters other than Hangul jamo and syllables are not
           affected.

       "$resultant_string = decomposeJamo($string)"
           It decomposes a complex jamo to a sequence of simple jamo if
           possible, and returns the result as a string.  Any characters other
           than complex jamo are not affected.

             e.g.
                 CHOSEONG SIOS-PIEUP to CHOSEONG SIOS + PIEUP
                 JUNGSEONG AE        to JUNGSEONG A + I
                 JUNGSEONG WE        to JUNGSEONG U + EO + I
                 JONGSEONG SSANGSIOS to JONGSEONG SIOS + SIOS

       "$resultant_string = composeJamo($string)"
           It composes a sequence of simple jamo ("L1 + L2", "V1 + V2 + V3",
           etc.)  to a complex jamo if possible, and returns the result as a
           string.  Any characters other than simple jamo are not affected.

             e.g.
                 CHOSEONG SIOS + PIEUP to CHOSEONG SIOS-PIEUP
                 JUNGSEONG A + I       to JUNGSEONG AE
                 JUNGSEONG U + EO + I  to JUNGSEONG WE
                 JONGSEONG SIOS + SIOS to JONGSEONG SSANGSIOS

       "$resultant_string = decomposeFull($string)"
           It decomposes a syllable/complex jamo to a sequence of simple jamo.
           Equivalent to "decomposeJamo(decomposeSyllable($string))".

   Composition and Decomposition (Old-interface, deprecated!)
       "$string_decomposed = decomposeHangul($code_point)"
       "@codepoints = decomposeHangul($code_point)"
           If the specified code point is of a Hangul syllable, it returns a
           list of code points (in a list context) or a string (in a scalar
           context) of its decomposition.

              decomposeHangul(0xAC00) # U+AC00 is HANGUL SYLLABLE GA.
                 returns "\x{1100}\x{1161}" or (0x1100, 0x1161);

              decomposeHangul(0xAE00) # U+AE00 is HANGUL SYLLABLE GEUL.
                 returns "\x{1100}\x{1173}\x{11AF}" or (0x1100, 0x1173, 0x11AF);

           Otherwise, returns false (empty string or empty list).

              decomposeHangul(0x0041) # outside Hangul syllables
                 returns empty string or empty list.

       "$string_composed = composeHangul($src_string)"
       "@code_points_composed = composeHangul($src_string)"
           Any sequence of an initial jamo "L" and a medial jamo "V" is
           composed to a syllable "LV"; then any sequence of a syllable "LV"
           and a final jamo "T" is composed to a syllable "LVT".

           Any characters other than Hangul jamo and syllables are not
           affected.

              composeHangul("\x{1100}\x{1173}\x{11AF}.")
              # returns "\x{AE00}." or (0xAE00,0x2E);

       "$code_point_composite = getHangulComposite($code_point_here,
       $code_point_next)"
           It returns the codepoint of the composite if both two code points,
           $code_point_here and $code_point_next, are in Hangul, and
           composable.

           Otherwise, returns "undef".

   Hangul Syllable Name
       The following functions handle only a precomposed Hangul syllable (from
       "U+AC00" to "U+D7A3"), but not a Hangul jamo or other Hangul-related
       character.

       Names of Hangul syllables have a format of "HANGUL SYLLABLE %s".

       "$name = getHangulName($code_point)"
           If the specified code point is of a Hangul syllable, it returns its
           name; otherwise it returns undef.

              getHangulName(0xAC00) returns "HANGUL SYLLABLE GA";
              getHangulName(0x0041) returns undef.

       "$codepoint = parseHangulName($name)"
           If the specified name is of a Hangul syllable, it returns its code
           point; otherwise it returns undef.

              parseHangulName("HANGUL SYLLABLE GEUL") returns 0xAE00;

              parseHangulName("LATIN SMALL LETTER A") returns undef;

              parseHangulName("HANGUL SYLLABLE PERL") returns undef;
               # Regrettably, HANGUL SYLLABLE PERL does not exist :-)

   Standard Korean Syllable Block
       Standard Korean syllable block consists of "L+ V+ T*" (a sequence of
       one or more L, one or more V, and zero or more T) according to
       conjoining jamo behabior revised in Unicode 3.2 (cf. UAX #28).  A
       sequence of "L" followed by "T" is not a syllable block without "V",
       but consists of two nonstandard syllable blocks: one without "V", and
       another without "L" and "V".

       "$bool = isStandardForm($string)"
           It returns boolean whether the string is encoded in the standard
           form without a nonstandard sequence. It returns true only if the
           string contains no nonstandard sequence.

       "$resultant_string = insertFiller($string)"
           It transforms the string into standard form by inserting fillers
           into each syllables and returns the result as a string.  Choseong
           filler ("Lf", "U+115F") is inserted into a syllable block without
           "L". Jungseong filler ("Vf", "U+1160") is inserted into a syllable
           block without "V".

       "$type = getSyllableType($code_point)"
           It returns the Hangul syllable type (cf. HangulSyllableType.txt)
           for the specified code point as a string: "L" for leading jamo, "V"
           for vowel jamo, "T" for trailing jamo, "LV" for LV syllables, "LVT"
           for LVT syllables, and "NA" for other code points (as Not
           Applicable).
