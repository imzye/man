NAME
       Devel::Required - automatic update of required modules documentation

VERSION
       This documentation describes version 0.16.

SYNOPSIS
               eval "use Devel::Required";
               use ExtUtils::MakeMaker; # check README and lib/Your/Module.pm
               WriteMakefile (
                       NAME         => "Your::Module",
                       VERSION_FROM => "lib/Your/Module.pm",
                       PREREQ_PM    => { 'Foo' => '1.0', 'Bar::Baz' => '0.05' }
               );

                       text => 'INSTALL',
                       pod  => [ qw( lib/Your/Module.pod ) ];
               CODE

               WriteMakefile (
                       NAME         => "Your::Module",
                       VERSION_FROM => "lib/Your/Module.pm",
                       PREREQ_PM    => { 'Foo' => '1.0', 'Bar::Baz' => '0.05' }
               );

       ...

               eval "use Devel::Required maint_blead => 5.014";
               use ExtUtils::MakeMaker; # specify maint / blead installation information

DESCRIPTION
       The Devel::Required module only serves a purpose in the development
       environment of an author of a CPAN module (or more precisely: a user of
       the ExtUtils::MakeMaker module).  It makes sure that any changes to the
       required modules specified in the Makefile.PL are automatically
       reflected in the appropriate text file and in the appropriate source
       files (either explicitely or implicitely specified).

       It takes the information given with the PREREQ_PM parameter and by
       default writes this to the README file, as well as to the POD of the
       file specified with the VERSION_FROM parameter.  Both these defaults
       can be overridden with the "text" and "pod" parameters in the "use
       Devel::Required" specification.

       Optionally, it will also update installation information, specifically
       for distributions that have a "maint" and "blead" version internally.

       This module should only be installed on the system of the developer.

       Note that as 0.17 the module should be used in an eval BEFORE loading
       +ExtUtils::MakeMaker, not afterwards as in previous versions. This
       version +should work on any version of perl.

FILES CHANGED
       By default the following types of files will be changed:

       text file
         A text file should at least have one of these marker texts:

          Version:                     <- must start at beginning of line
                                       <- empty line
                                       <- another empty line

          Required Modules:            <- must start at beginning of line
                                       <- empty line
                                       <- another empty line

         Optionally it may have an "Installation:" marker:

          Installation:                <- must start at beginning of line
                                       <- empty line
                                       <- another empty line
                                       <- yet another empty line

         After Makefile.PL is executed (using the example of the SYNOPSIS),
         the above will be changed to:

          Version:                                    <- must start at beginning of line
           This documentation describes version #.##. <- added
                                                      <- empty line

          Required Modules:              <- must start at beginning of line
           Foo (1.0)                     <- added
           Bar::Baz (0.05)               <- added
                                         <- empty line

          Installation:                  <- must start at beginning of line
          (extensive installation info)  <- added
                                         <- empty line
                                         <- another empty line

         No changes will be made if none of the marker texts are not found.

         If no "text" file specification is specified, then the file "README"
         in the current directory will be assumed.

       pod file
         The pod file(s) that are (implicitely) specified, will be searched
         for any marker texts that consist of the lines:

          =head1 VERSION               <- must start at beginning of line
                                       <- empty line
          =(anything)                  <- any other pod directive

          =head1 REQUIRED MODULES      <- must start at beginning of line
                                       <- empty line
          =(anything)                  <- any other pod directive

         Optionally it may have an "INSTALLATION" marker:

          =head1 INSTALLATION          <- must start at beginning of line
                                       <- empty line
          =(anything)                  <- any other pod directive

         After Makefile.PL is executed (using the example of the SYNOPSIS, the
         above will be changed to:

          =head1 VERSION                              <- must start at beginning of line
                                                      <- empty line
          This documentation describes version #.##.  <- added
                                                      <- added
          =(anything)                                 <- any other pod directive

          =head1 REQUIRED MODULES                     <- must start at beginning of line
                                                      <- empty line
           Foo (1.0)                                  <- added
           Bar::Baz (0.05)                            <- added
                                                      <- added
          =(anything)                                 <- any other pod directive

          =head1 INSTALLATION                         <- must start at beginning of line
                                                      <- empty line
          (extensive installation info)               <- added
                                                      <- added
          =(anything)                                 <- any other pod directive

         No changes will be made if none of the marker texts are not found.

         If no "pod" file specification is specified, then the file specified
         with the "VERSION_FROM" parameter of the call to "WriteMakefile" will
         be assumed.

SPECIFYING YOUR OWN FILES
       It is possible to specify which text and which pod files should be
       searched for the text markers and possibly updated.  The "import"
       routine of Devel::Required takes a list of parameters, each pair of
       which is considered to be a key-value pair.  The following keys are
       recognized:

       text
         The value of this parameter is either the name of the text file to
         check, or a reference to a list with the names of one or more text
         files.

       pod
         The value of this parameter is either the name of a file containing
         pod to check, or a reference to a list withe the names of one or more
         files containing pod.

ADDING MAINT / blead INSTALLATION INFORMATION
        use Devel::Required maint_blead => $version;

       By specifying a version number with the <maint_blead> key, the text /
       pod files will be searched for an "Installation" marker.  The value
       should be the Perl version below which the "maint" version of the code
       should be installed.

       The actual installation text is more or less fixed, but may be adapted
       in the future to provide more clarity for developers and packagers.

REQUIRED MODULES
        ExtUtils::MakeMaker

THEORY OF OPERATION
       Loading this module steals the "WriteMakefile" subroutine of the
       calling package and inserts its own logic for updating the necessary
       text-files.  The version information is read from the generated
       "Makefile".
