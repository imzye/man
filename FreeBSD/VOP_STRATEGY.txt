NAME
     VOP_STRATEGY – read or write a file system buffer

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <sys/vnode.h>

DESCRIPTION
     The arguments are:

     vp  The vnode that the buffer is for.

     bp  The buffer to be read or written.

     This call either reads or writes data from a file, depending on the value
     of bp->b_io.bio_cmd.

     The call may block.

RETURN VALUES
     Always zero.  Errors should be signalled by setting BIO_ERROR on
     b_ioflags field in struct buf, and setting b_error to the appropriate
     errno value.
