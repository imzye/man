NAME
       Test::Manifest - interact with a t/test_manifest file

SYNOPSIS
               # in Makefile.PL
               eval "use Test::Manifest 2.00";

               # in Build.PL
               my $class = do {
                       if( eval 'use Test::Manifest 2.00; 1' ) {
                               Test::Manifest->get_module_build_subclass;
                               }
                       else {
                               'Module::Build';
                               }
                       };

               my $build = $class->new( ... )

               # in the file t/test_manifest, list the tests you want
               # to run in the order you want to run them

DESCRIPTION
       "Test::Harness" assumes that you want to run all of the .t files in the
       t/ directory in ASCII-betical order during "make test" or "./Build
       test" unless you say otherwise.  This leads to some interesting naming
       schemes for test files to get them in the desired order. These
       interesting names ossify when they get into source control, and get
       even more interesting as more tests show up.

       "Test::Manifest" overrides the default test file order. Instead of
       running all of the t/*.t files in ASCII-betical order, it looks in the
       t/test_manifest file to find out which tests you want to run and the
       order in which you want to run them.  It constructs the right value for
       the build system to do the right thing.

       In t/test_manifest, simply list the tests that you want to run.  Their
       order in the file is the order in which they run.  You can comment
       lines with a "#", just like in Perl, and "Test::Manifest" will strip
       leading and trailing whitespace from each line.  It also checks that
       the specified file is actually in the t/ directory.  If the file does
       not exist, it does not put its name in the list of test files to run
       and it will issue a warning.

       Optionally, you can add a number after the test name in test_manifest
       to define sets of tests. See "get_t_files" for more information.

   ExtUtils::MakeMaker
       To override the test order behaviour in "MakeMaker", "Test::Manifest"
       inserts itself in the "test_via_harness" step by providing its own test
       runner. In "Makefile.PL", all you have to do is load "Test::Manifest"
       before you call "WriteMakefile". To make it optional, load it in an
       eval:

               eval "use Test::Manifest";

   Module::Build
       Overriding parts of "Module::Build" is tricker if you want to use the
       subclassing mechanism and still make "Test::Manifest" optional. If you
       can load "Test::Manifest" (version 2.00 or later), "Test::Manifest" can
       create the subclass for you.

               my $class = do {
                       if( eval 'use Test::Manifest 2.00; 1' ) {
                               Test::Manifest->get_module_build_subclass;
                               }
                       else {
                               'Module::Build' # if Test::Manifest isn't there
                               }
                       };

               $class->new( ... );
               $class->create_build_file;

       This is a bit of a problem when you already have your own subclass.
       "Test::Manifest" overrides "find_test_files", so you can get just that
       code to add to your own subclass code string:

               my $code = eval 'use Test::Manifest 2.00; 1'
                               ?
                       Test::Manifest->get_module_build_code_string
                               :
                       '';

               my $class = Module::Build->subclass(
                       ...,
                       code => "$code\n...your subclass code string...",
                       );

   Class methods
       get_module_build_subclass
           For "Module::Build" only.

           Returns a "Module::Build" subclass that overrides
           "find_test_files". If you want to have your own "Module::Build"
           subclass and still use "Test::Manifest", you can get just the code
           string with "get_module_build_code_string".

       get_module_build_code_string
           For "Module::Build" only.

           Returns the overridden "find_test_files" as Perl code in a string
           suitable for the "code" key in "Module::Build-"subclass()>. You can
           add this to other bits you are overriding or extending.

           See "Module::Build::Base::find_test_files" to see the base
           implementation.

   Functions
       run_t_manifest( TEST_VERBOSE, INST_LIB, INST_ARCHLIB, TEST_LEVEL )
           For "MakeMaker" only. You don't have to mess with this at the user
           level.

           Run all of the files in t/test_manifest through
           "Test::Harness:runtests" in the order they appear in the file. This
           is inserted automatically

                   eval "use Test::Manifest";

       get_t_files( [LEVEL] )
           In scalar context it returns a single string that you can use
           directly in WriteMakefile(). In list context it returns a list of
           the files it found in t/test_manifest.

           If a t/test_manifest file does not exist, get_t_files() returns
           nothing.

           get_t_files() warns you if it can't find t/test_manifest, or if
           entries start with t/. It skips blank lines, and strips Perl style
           comments from the file.

           Each line in t/test_manifest can have three parts: the test name,
           the test level (a floating point number), and a comment. By
           default, the test level is 1.

                   test_name.t 2  #Run this only for level 2 testing

           Without an argument, get_t_files() returns all the test files it
           finds. With an argument that is true (so you can't use 0 as a
           level) and is a number, it skips tests with a level greater than
           that argument. You can then define sets of tests and choose a set
           to run. For instance, you might create a set for end users, but
           also add on a set for deeper testing for developers.

           Experimentally, you can include a command to grab test names from
           another file. The command starts with a ";" to distinguish it from
           a true filename. The filename (currently) is relative to the
           current working directory, unlike the filenames, which are relative
           to "t/". The filenames in the included are still relative to "t/".

                   ;include t/file_with_other_test_names.txt

           Also experimentally, you can stop "Test::Manifest" from reading
           filenames with the ";skip" directive. "Test::Manifest" will skip
           the filenames up to the ";unskip" directive (or end of file):

                   run_this1
                   ;skip
                   skip_this
                   ;unskip
                   run_this2

           To select sets of tests, specify the level in the environment
           variable "TEST_LEVEL":

                   make test # run all tests no matter the level
                   make test TEST_LEVEL=2  # run all tests level 2 and below

           Eventually this will end up as an option to Build.PL:

                   ./Build test --testlevel=2  # Not yet supported

       make_test_manifest()
           Creates the test_manifest file in the t directory by reading the
           contents of the t/ directory.

           TO DO: specify tests in argument lists.

           TO DO: specify files to skip.

       manifest_name()
           Returns the name of the test manifest file, relative to t/.
