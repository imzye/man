XML::Parser::Style::Elemental(3)           User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       XML::Parser::Style::Elemental - a slightly more advanced and flexible
       object tree style for XML::Parser

SYNOPSIS
        #!/usr/bin/perl -w
        use XML::Parser;
        use Data::Dumper;
        my $p = XML::Parser->new( Style => 'Elemental', Pkg => 'E' );
        my $doc = <<DOC;
        <foo>
            <bar key="value">The world is foo enough.</bar>
        </foo>
        DOC
        my ($e) = $p->parse($doc);
        print Data::Dumper->Dump( [$e] );

        my $test_node = $e->contents->[0];
        print "root: ".$test_node->root." is ".$e."\n";
        print "text content of ".$test_node->name."\n";
        print $test_node->text_content;

DESCRIPTION
       This module is similar to the XML::Parser Objects style, but slightly
       more advanced and flexible. Like the Objects style, an object is
       created for each element. Elemental uses a dynamic class factory to
       create objects with accessor methods or can use any supplied classes
       that support the same method signatures. This module also provides full
       namespace support when the "Namespace" option is in use in addition to
       a "No_Whitespace" option for stripping out extraneous non-markup
       characters that are commonly introduced when formatting XML to be human
       readable.

CLASS TYPES
       Elemental style creates its parse tree with three class types --
       Document, Element and Character. Developers have the option of using
       the built-in dynamic classes or registering their own.  The following
       explains the purpose and method prototypes of each class type.

       Document - The root of the tree.
           contents - An array reference of direct decendents.
           root - Return reference of itself.
       Element - The tags in the document.
           name - The tag name. If the Namespace options is set to true, the
           extend name is stored.
           parent - A reference to the parent object.
           contents - An ordered array reference of direct
           descendents/children objects.
           attributes - A hash reference of key-value pairs representing the
           tags attributes.
           text_content - The text content of all siblings, whitespace
           included.
           root - A reference to the Document object.
       Characters - Non-markup text.
           data - A string of non-markup characters.
           parent - A reference to the parent object.
           root - A reference to the Document object.

OPTIONS
       Elemental specific options are set in the XML::Parser constructor
       through a hash element with a key of 'Elemental', The value of
       Elemental is expected to be a hash reference with one of more of the
       option keys detailed in the following sections.

   USING DYNAMIC CLASS OBJECTS
       When parsing a document, Elemental uses a dynamic class factory to
       create minimal lightweight objects with accessor methods. These classes
       implement the pattern detailed in "CLASS TYPES" in addition to a
       parameterless constructor method of "new". Similar to the Objects style
       these classes are blessed into the package set with the "Pkg" option.

       Here we create a parser that uses Elemental to create Document, Element
       and Characters objects in the E package.

        my $p = XML::Parser->new( Style => 'Elemental', Pkg => 'E' );

   REGISTERING CLASSES
       If you require something more functional then the generated dynamic
       classes you can register your own with Elemental. Like the Elemental
       class types, the option keys are "Document", "Element" and
       "Characters". Here we register three classes and turn on the
       "No_Whitespace" option.

        my $p = XML::Parser->new(  Style => 'Elemental',
                                   Namespace => 1,
                                   Elemental=>{
                                           Document=>'Foo::Doc',
                                           Element=>'Foo::El',
                                           Characters=>'Foo::Chars',
                                           No_Whitespace=>1
                                   }
                                );

       Note that, the same class can be registered for more then one class
       type as long as it supports all of the necessary method prototypes it
       is being registered to handle. See "CLASS TYPES" for more detail.

   NO_WHITESPACE
       When set to true, "No_Whitespace" causes Elemental to pass over
       character strings of all whitespace instead of creating a new Character
       object. This options is helpful in stripping out extraneous non-markup
       characters that are commonly introduced when formatting XML to be human
       readable.
