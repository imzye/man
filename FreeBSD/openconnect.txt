DESCRIPTION
       The program openconnect connects to VPN servers which use standard
       TLS/SSL, DTLS, and ESP protocols for data transport.

       It was originally written to support Cisco "AnyConnect" VPN servers,
       and has since been extended with experimental support for Juniper
       Network Connect (--protocol=nc), Junos/Ivanti Pulse VPN servers
       (--protocol=pulse), PAN GlobalProtect VPN servers (--protocol=gp), F5
       Big-IP VPN servers (--protocol=f5), Fortinet Fortigate VPN servers
       (--protocol=fortinet), and Array Networks SSL VPN servers
       (--protocol=array).

       The connection happens in two phases. First there is a simple HTTPS
       connection over which the user authenticates somehow - by using a
       certificate, or password or SecurID, etc.  Having authenticated, the
       user is rewarded with an authentication cookie which can be used to
       make the real VPN connection.

       The second phase uses that cookie to connect to a tunnel via HTTPS, and
       data packets can be passed over the resulting connection. When
       possible, a UDP tunnel is also configured: AnyConnect uses DTLS, while
       Juniper and GlobalProtect use UDP-encapsulated ESP. The UDP tunnel may
       be disabled with --no-dtls, but is preferred when correctly supported
       by the server and network for performance reasons. (TCP performs poorly
       and unreliably over TCP-based tunnels; see
       http://sites.inka.de/~W1011/devel/tcp-tcp.html.)


OPTIONS
       --config=CONFIGFILE
              Read further options from CONFIGFILE before continuing to
              process options from the command line. The file should contain
              long-format options as would be accepted on the command line,
              but without the two leading -- dashes. Empty lines, or lines
              where the first non-space character is a # character, are
              ignored.

              Any option except the config option may be specified in the
              file.

       -b,--background
              Continue in background after startup

       --pid-file=PIDFILE
              Save the pid to PIDFILE when backgrounding

       -c,--certificate=CERT [,--mca-certificate=CERT]
              Use SSL client certificate CERT which may be either a file name
              or, if OpenConnect has been built with an appropriate version of
              GnuTLS, a PKCS#11 URL.

              The --mca-certificate option sets the secondary certificate for
              multi-certificate authentication (according to Cisco's
              terminology, the SSL client certificate is called the "machine"
              certificate, and the second certificate is called the "user"
              certificate).

       -e,--cert-expire-warning=DAYS
              Give a warning when SSL client certificate has DAYS left before
              expiry

       -k,--sslkey=KEY [,--mca-key=KEY]
              Use SSL private key KEY which may be either a file name or, if
              OpenConnect has been built with an appropriate version of
              GnuTLS, a PKCS#11 URL.

              The --mca-key option sets the private key for the secondary
              certificate (see --mca-certificate).

       -C,--cookie=COOKIE
              Use authentication cookie COOKIE.

       --cookie-on-stdin
              Read cookie from standard input.

       -d,--deflate
              Enable all compression, including stateful modes. By default,
              only stateless compression algorithms are enabled.

       -D,--no-deflate
              Disable all compression.

       --compression=MODE
              Set compression mode, where MODE is one of stateless, none, or
              all.

              By default, only stateless compression algorithms which do not
              maintain state from one packet to the next (and which can be
              used on UDP transports) are enabled. By setting the mode to all
              stateful algorithms (currently only zlib deflate) can be
              enabled. Or all compression can be disabled by setting the mode
              to none.

       --force-dpd=INTERVAL
              Use INTERVAL as Dead Peer Detection interval (in seconds). This
              will cause the client to use DPD at the specified interval even
              if the server hasn't requested it, or at a different interval
              from the one requested by the server.

              DPD mechanisms vary by protocol and by transport (TLS or
              DTLS/ESP), but are all functionally similar: they enable either
              the VPN client or the VPN server to transmit a signal to the
              peer, requesting an immediate reply which can be used to confirm
              that the link between the two peers is still working.

       -g,--usergroup=GROUP
              Set the URL path of the initial HTTPS connection to the server.

              With some protocols, this path may function as a login group or
              realm, hence the naming of this option. For example, the
              following invocations of OpenConnect are equivalent:
              openconnect --usergroup=loginPath vpn.server.com
              openconnect https://vpn.server.com/loginPath


       -F,--form-entry=FORM:OPTION[=VALUE]
              Provide authentication form input, where FORM and OPTION are the
              identifiers from the form and the specific input field, and
              VALUE is the string to be filled in automatically. For example,
              the standard username field (also handled by the --user option)
              could also be provided with this option thus: --form-entry
              main:username=joebloggs.

              If VALUE is not specified, this option will cause a hidden form
              field to be treated as a standard text-input field.

              This option should not be used to enter passwords.
              --passwd-on-stdin should be used for that purpose. Not only will
              this option expose the password value via the OpenConnect
              process's command line, but unlike --passwd-on-stdin this option
              will not recognize the case of an incorrect password, and stop
              trying to re-enter it repeatedly.

       -h,--help
              Display help text

       --http-auth=METHODS
              Use only the specified methods for HTTP authentication to a
              server.  By default, only Negotiate, NTLM and Digest
              authentication are enabled.  Basic authentication is also
              supported but because it is insecure it must be explicitly
              enabled. The argument is a comma-separated list of methods to be
              enabled. Note that the order does not matter: OpenConnect will
              use Negotiate, NTLM, Digest and Basic authentication in that
              order, if each is enabled, regardless of the order specified in
              the METHODS string.

       --external-browser=BROWSER
              Set BROWSER as the executable used by OpenConnect to handle the
              authentication process with gateways that support the
              single-sign-on-external-browser authentication method.

       -i,--interface=IFNAME
              Use IFNAME for tunnel interface

       -l,--syslog
              After tunnel is brought up, use syslog for further progress
              messages

       --timestamp
              Prepend a timestamp to each progress message

       --passtos
              Copy TOS / TCLASS of payload packet into DTLS and ESP packets.
              This is not set by default because it may leak information about
              the payload (for example, by differentiating voice/video
              traffic).

       -U,--setuid=USER
              Drop privileges after connecting, to become user USER

       --csd-user=USER
              Drop privileges during execution of trojan binary or script
              (CSD, TNCC, or HIP).

       --csd-wrapper=SCRIPT
              Run SCRIPT instead of the trojan binary or script.

       --force-trojan=INTERVAL
              Use INTERVAL as interval (in seconds) for repeat execution of
              Trojan binary or script, overriding default and/or server-set
              interval.

       -m,--mtu=MTU
              Request MTU from server as the MTU of the tunnel.

       --base-mtu=MTU
              Indicate MTU as the path MTU between client and server on the
              unencrypted network. Newer servers will automatically calculate
              the MTU to be used on the tunnel from this value.

       -p,--key-password=PASS [,--mca-key-password=PASS]
              Provide passphrase for certificate file, or SRK (System Root
              Key) PIN for TPM

              --mca-key-password provides the passphrase for the secondary
              certificate (see --mca-certificate).

       -P,--proxy=PROXYURL
              Use HTTP or SOCKS proxy for connection. A username and password
              can be provided in the given URL, and will be used for
              authentication. If authentication is required but no credentials
              are given, GSSAPI and automatic NTLM authentication using
              Samba's ntlm_auth helper tool may be attempted.

       --proxy-auth=METHODS
              Use only the specified methods for HTTP authentication to a
              proxy.  By default, only Negotiate, NTLM and Digest
              authentication are enabled. Basic authentication is also
              supported but because it is insecure it must be explicitly
              enabled. The argument is a comma-separated list of methods to be
              enabled. Note that the order does not matter: OpenConnect will
              use Negotiate, NTLM, Digest and Basic authentication in that
              order, if each is enabled, regardless of the order specified in
              the METHODS string.

       --no-proxy
              Disable use of proxy

       --libproxy
              Use libproxy to configure proxy automatically (when built with
              libproxy support)

       --key-password-from-fsid
              Passphrase for certificate file is automatically generated from
              the fsid of the file system on which it is stored. The fsid is
              obtained from the statvfs(2) or statfs(2) system call, depending
              on the operating system. On a Linux or similar system with GNU
              coreutils, the fsid used by this option should be equal to the
              output of the command:
              stat --file-system --printf=%i\\n $CERTIFICATE
              It is not the same as the 128-bit UUID of the file system.

       -q,--quiet
              Less output

       -Q,--queue-len=LEN
              Set packet queue limit to LEN packets. The default is 32. A high
              value may allow better overall bandwidth but at a cost of
              latency. If you run Voice over IP or other interactive traffic
              over the VPN, you don't want those packets to be queued behind
              thousands of other large packets which are part of a bulk
              transfer.

              This option sets the maximum inbound and outbound packet queue
              sizes in OpenConnect itself, which control how many packets will
              be sent and received in a single batch, as well as affecting
              other buffering such as the socket send buffer (SO_SNDBUF) for
              network connections and the OS tunnel device.

              Ultimately, the right size for a queue is "just enough packets
              that it never quite gets empty before more are pushed to it".
              Any higher than that is simply introducing bufferbloat and
              additional latency with no benefit. With the default of 32, we
              are able to saturate a single Gigabit Ethernet from modest
              hardware, which is more than enough for most VPN users.

              If OpenConnect is built with vhost-net support, it will only be
              used if the queue length is set to 16 or more. This is because
              vhost-net introduces a small amount of additional latency, but
              improves total bandwidth quite considerably for those operating
              at high traffic rates. Thus it makes sense to use it when the
              user has indicated a preference for bandwidth over latency, by
              increasing the queue size.


       -s,--script=SCRIPT
              Invoke SCRIPT to configure the network after connection. Without
              this, routing and name service are unlikely to work correctly.
              The script is expected to be compatible with the vpnc-script
              which is shipped with the "vpnc" VPN client. See
              https://www.infradead.org/openconnect/vpnc-script.html for more
              information. This version of OpenConnect is configured to use
              /usr/local/sbin/vpnc-script by default.

              On Windows, a relative directory for the default script will be
              handled as starting from the directory that the openconnect
              executable is running from, rather than the current directory.
              The script will be invoked with the command-based script host
              cscript.exe.

       -S,--script-tun
              Pass traffic to 'script' program over a UNIX socket, instead of
              to a kernel tun/tap device. This allows the VPN IP traffic to be
              handled entirely in userspace, for example by a program which
              uses lwIP to provide SOCKS access into the VPN.

       --server=[https://]HOST[:PORT][/PATH]
              Define the VPN server as a simple HOST or as an URL containing
              the HOST and optionally the PORT number and the PATH; with some
              protocols, the path may function as a login group or realm, and
              it may equivalently be specified with --usergroup.

              As an alternative, define the VPN server as non-option command
              line argument.

       -u,--user=NAME
              Set login username to NAME

       -V,--version
              Report version number

       -v,--verbose
              More output (may be specified multiple times for additional
              output)

       -x,--xmlconfig=CONFIG
              XML config file

       --authgroup=GROUP
              Select GROUP from authentication dropdown or list entry.

              Many VPNs require a selection from a dropdown or list during the
              authentication process. This selection may be known as authgroup
              (on Cisco VPNs), realm (Juniper, Pulse, Fortinet), domain (F5),
              and gateway (GlobalProtect).  This option attempts to
              automatically fill the appropriate protocol-specific field with
              the desired value.

       --authenticate
              Authenticate to the VPN, output the information needed to make
              the connection in a form which can be used to set shell
              environment variables, and then exit.

              When invoked with this option, OpenConnect will not actually
              create the VPN connection or configure a tunnel interface, but
              if successful will print something like the following to stdout:
              COOKIE='3311180634@13561856@1339425499@B315A0E29D16C6FD92EE...'
              HOST='10.0.0.1'
              CONNECT_URL='https://vpnserver.example.com'
              FINGERPRINT='469bb424ec8835944d30bc77c77e8fc1d8e23a42'
              RESOLVE='vpnserver.example.com:10.0.0.1'
              Thus, you can invoke openconnect as a non-privileged user (with
              access to the user's PKCS#11 tokens, etc.)  for authentication,
              and then invoke openconnect separately to make the actual
              connection as root:
              eval `openconnect --authenticate https://vpnserver.example.com`;
              [ -n ["$COOKIE"] ] && echo ["$COOKIE"] |
                sudo openconnect --cookie-on-stdin $CONNECT_URL --servercert $FINGERPRINT --resolve $RESOLVE

              Earlier versions of OpenConnect produced only the HOST variable
              (containing the numeric server address), and not the CONNECT_URL
              or RESOLVE variables. Subsequently, we discovered that servers
              behind proxies may not respond correctly unless the correct DNS
              name is present in the connection phase, and we added support
              for VPN protocols where the server URL's path component may be
              significant in the connection phase, prompting the addition of
              CONNECT_URL and RESOLVE, and the recommendation to use them as
              described above.  If you are not certain that you are invoking a
              newer version of OpenConnect which outputs these variables, use
              the following command-line (compatible with most Bourne shell
              derivatives) which will work with either a newer or older
              version:
              sudo openconnect --cookie-on-stdin ${CONNECT_URL:-$HOST} --servercert $FINGERPRINT ${RESOLVE:+--resolve=$RESOLVE}

       --cookieonly
              Fetch and print cookie only; don't connect (this is essentially
              a subset of --authenticate).

       --printcookie
              Print cookie to stdout before connecting (see --authenticate for
              the meaning of this cookie)

       --cafile=FILE
              Additional CA file for server verification. By default, this
              simply causes OpenConnect to trust additional root CA
              certificate(s) in addition to those trusted by the system. Use
              --no-system-trust to prevent OpenConnect from trusting the
              system default certificate authorities.

       --no-system-trust
              Do not trust the system default certificate authorities. If this
              option is given, only certificate authorities given with the
              --cafile option, if any, will be trusted automatically.

       --disable-ipv6
              Do not advertise IPv6 capability to server

       --dtls-ciphers=LIST
              Set OpenSSL ciphers to support for DTLS

       --dtls12-ciphers=LIST
              Set OpenSSL ciphers for Cisco's DTLS v1.2

       --dtls-local-port=PORT
              Use PORT as the local port for DTLS and UDP datagrams

       --dump-http-traffic
              Enable verbose output of all HTTP requests and the bodies of all
              responses received from the server.


       --pfs  Enforces Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS). That ensures that if the
              server's long-term key is compromised, any session keys
              established before the compromise will be unaffected. If this
              option is provided and the server does not support PFS in the
              TLS channel the connection will fail.

              PFS is available in Cisco ASA releases 9.1(2) and higher; a
              suitable cipher suite may need to be manually enabled by the
              administrator using the ssl encryption setting.


       --no-dtls
              Disable DTLS and ESP

       --no-http-keepalive
              Version 8.2.2.5 of the Cisco ASA software has a bug where it
              will forget the client's SSL certificate when HTTP connections
              are being re-used for multiple requests. So far, this has only
              been seen on the initial connection, where the server gives an
              HTTP/1.0 redirect response with an explicit Connection:
              Keep-Alive directive. OpenConnect as of v2.22 has an
              unconditional workaround for this, which is never to obey that
              directive after an HTTP/1.0 response.

              However, Cisco's support team has failed to give any competent
              response to the bug report and we don't know under what other
              circumstances their bug might manifest itself. So this option
              exists to disable ALL re-use of HTTP sessions and cause a new
              connection to be made for each request. If your server seems not
              to be recognizing your certificate, try this option. If it makes
              a difference, please report this information to the
              openconnect-devel@lists.infradead.org mailing list.

       --no-passwd
              Never attempt password (or SecurID) authentication.

       --no-external-auth
              Prevent OpenConnect from advertising to the server that it
              supports any kind of authentication mode that requires an
              external browser.

              Some servers will force the client to use such an authentication
              mode if the client advertises it, but fallback to a more
              "scriptable" authentication mode if the client doesn't appear to
              support it.

       --no-xmlpost
              Do not attempt to post an XML authentication/configuration
              request to the server; use the old style GET method which was
              used by older clients and servers instead.

              This option is a temporary safety net, to work around potential
              compatibility issues with the code which falls back to the old
              method automatically. It causes OpenConnect to behave more like
              older versions (4.08 and below) did. If you find that you need
              to use this option, then you have found a bug in OpenConnect.
              Please see https://www.infradead.org/openconnect/mail.html and
              report this to the developers.

       --allow-insecure-crypto
              The ancient, broken 3DES and RC4 ciphers are insecure; we
              explicitly disable them by default. However, some still-in-use
              VPN servers can't do any better.

              This option enables use of these insecure ciphers, as well as
              the use of SHA1 for server certificate validation.

       --non-inter
              Do not expect user input; exit if it is required.

       --passwd-on-stdin
              Read password from standard input

       --protocol=PROTO
              Select VPN protocol PROTO to be used for the connection.
              Supported protocols are anyconnect for Cisco AnyConnect (the
              default), nc for experimental support for Juniper Network
              Connect (also supported by most Junos/Ivanti Pulse servers),
              pulse for experimental support for Junos/Ivanti Pulse, gp for
              experimental support for PAN GlobalProtect, f5 for experimental
              support for F5 Big-IP, fortinet for experimental support for
              Fortinet Fortigate, and array for experimental support for Array
              Networks SSL VPN.

              See https://www.infradead.org/openconnect/protocols.html for
              details on features and deficiencies of the individual
              protocols.

              OpenConnect does not yet support all of the authentication
              options used by Pulse, nor does it support Host Checker/TNCC
              with Pulse. If your Junos/Ivanti Pulse VPN is not yet supported
              with --protocol=pulse, then --protocol=nc may be a useful
              fallback option.

       --token-mode=MODE
              Enable one-time password generation using the MODE algorithm.
              --token-mode=rsa will call libstoken to generate an RSA SecurID
              tokencode, --token-mode=totp will generate an RFC 6238 time-
              based password, and --token-mode=hotp will generate an RFC 4226
              HMAC-based password. Yubikey tokens which generate OATH codes in
              hardware are supported with --token-mode=yubioath.
              --token-mode=oidc will use the provided OpenIDConnect token as
              an RFC 6750 bearer token.

       --token-secret={ SECRET[,COUNTER] | @FILENAME }
              The secret to use when generating one-time
              passwords/verification codes.  Base 32-encoded TOTP/HOTP secrets
              can be used by specifying "base32:" at the beginning of the
              secret, and for HOTP secrets the token counter can be specified
              following a comma.

              RSA SecurID secrets can be specified as an Android/iPhone URI or
              a raw numeric CTF string (with or without dashes).

              For Yubikey OATH the token secret specifies the name of the
              credential to be used. If not provided, the first OATH
              credential found on the device will be used.

              For OIDC the secret is the bearer token to be used.

              FILENAME, if specified, can contain any of the above strings.
              Or, it can contain a SecurID XML (SDTID) seed.

              If this option is omitted, and --token-mode is "rsa", libstoken
              will try to use the software token seed saved in ~/.stokenrc by
              the "stoken import" command.

       --reconnect-timeout=SECONDS
              After disconnection or Dead Peer Detection, keep trying to
              reconnect for SECONDS.  The default is 300 seconds, which means
              that openconnect can recover a VPN connection after a temporary
              network outage lasting up to 300 seconds.

       --resolve=HOST:IP
              Automatically resolve the hostname HOST to IP instead of using
              the normal resolver to look it up.

       --sni=HOST
              When creating new TLS connections, always present the hostname
              HOST as the SNI (Server Name Indication) in place of the correct
              hostname, which will still be sent in the HTTP 'Host:' header,
              and expect the peer's certificate to match the SNI rather than
              the correct hostname.  This may be useful for Domain Fronting,
              by which some filtered or censored Internet connections can be
              bypassed.

              Note that sending different values for the SNI and 'Host:'
              header violates HTTP standards and is prevented by many cloud
              hosting providers.

       --servercert=HASH
              Accept server's SSL certificate only if it matches the provided
              fingerprint.  This option implies --no-system-trust, and may be
              specified multiple times in order to accept multiple possible
              fingerprints.

              The allowed fingerprint types are SHA1, SHA256, and PIN-SHA256.
              They are distinguished by the 'sha1:', 'sha256:' and 'pin-
              sha256:' prefixes to the encoded hash. The first two are custom
              identifiers providing hex encoding of the peer's public key,
              while 'pin-sha256:' is the RFC7469 key PIN, which utilizes
              base64 encoding. To ease certain testing use-cases, a partial
              match of the hash will also be accepted, if it is at least 4
              characters past the prefix.

       --useragent=STRING
              Use STRING as 'User-Agent:' field value in HTTP header.

              Some VPN servers may require specific values matching those sent
              by proprietary VPN clients in order to successfully authenticate
              or connect. For example, when connecting to a Cisco VPN server,
              --useragent 'AnyConnect Windows 4.10.06079' or --useragent
              'Cisco AnyConnect VPN Agent for Windows 2.2.0133', or when
              connecting to a Pulse server, --useragent 'Pulse-
              Secure/9.1.11.6725'.

       --version-string=STRING
              Use STRING as the software version reported to the head end.
              (e.g. --version-string '2.2.0133')

       --local-hostname=STRING
              Use STRING as 'X-CSTP-Hostname:' field value in HTTP header. For
              example --local-hostname 'mypc', will advertise the value 'mypc'
              as the suggested hostname to point to the provided IP address.

       --os=STRING
              OS type to report to gateway.  Recognized values are: linux,
              linux-64, win, mac-intel, android, apple-ios.  Reporting a
              different OS type may affect the dynamic access policy (DAP)
              applied to the VPN session.  If the gateway requires CSD, it
              will also cause the corresponding CSD trojan binary to be
              downloaded, so you may need to use --csd-wrapper if this code is
              not executable on the local machine.

SIGNALS
       In the data phase of the connection, the following signals are handled:

       SIGINT / SIGTERM
              performs a clean shutdown by logging the session off,
              disconnecting from the gateway, and running the vpnc-script to
              restore the network configuration.

       SIGHUP disconnects from the gateway and runs the vpnc-script, but does
              not log the session off; this allows for reconnection later
              using --cookie.

       SIGUSR1
              writes progress message with detailed connection information and
              statistics.

       SIGUSR2
              forces an immediate disconnection and reconnection; this can be
              used to quickly recover from LAN IP address changes.

LIMITATIONS

       features that we wish OpenConnect had, and
       https://www.infradead.org/openconnect/protocols.html for information on
       the quirks and limitations of the individual VPN protocols.
