DESCRIPTION
       This is a wrapper around Net::SSLeay providing a simple interface for
       the use of Business::OnlinePayment.

       It used to allow switching between Net::SSLeay and Crypt::SSLeay
       implementations, but that was obsoleted.  If you need to do that, use
       LWP instead.  You can set $Net::HTTPS::SSL_SOCKET_CLASS = "Net::SSL"
       for Crypt::SSLeay instead of the default Net::SSLeay (since 6.02).

FUNCTIONS
   https_get HASHREF | FIELD => VALUE, ...
       Accepts parameters as either a hashref or a list of fields and values.

       Parameters are:

       host
       port
       path
       headers (hashref)
           For example: { 'X-Header1' => 'value', ... }

       args
           CGI arguments, either as a hashref or a listref.  In the latter
           case, ordering is preserved (see Tie::IxHash to do so when passing
           a hashref).

       debug
           Set true to enable debugging.

       Returns a list consisting of the page content as a string, the HTTP
       response code and message (i.e. "200 OK" or "404 Not Found"), and a
       list of key/value pairs representing the HTTP response headers.

   https_post HASHREF | FIELD => VALUE, ...
       Accepts parameters as either a hashref or a list of fields and values.

       Parameters are:

       host
       port
       path
       headers (hashref)
           For example: { 'X-Header1' => 'value', ... }

       Content-Type
           Defaults to "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" if not specified.

       args
           CGI arguments, either as a hashref or a listref.  In the latter
           case, ordering is preserved (see Tie::IxHash to do so when passing
           a hashref).

       content
           Raw content (overrides args).  A simple scalar containing the raw
           content.

       debug
           Set true to enable debugging in the underlying SSL module.

       Returns a list consisting of the page content as a string, the HTTP
       response code and message (i.e. "200 OK" or "404 Not Found"), and a
       list of key/value pairs representing the HTTP response headers.
