CLOJURE(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             CLOJURE(1)

NAME
       clj, clojure - runners to launch Clojure programs


SYNOPSIS
       clj [clj-opts] [-Aaliases]
       clojure [clj-opts] -X[aliases] my/fn? [kpath v ...] kv-map?
       clojure [clj-opts] -T[name|aliases] my/fn [kpath v ...] kv-map?
       clojure [clj-opts] -M[aliases] [init-opts] [main-opts] [args]


DESCRIPTION
       The clojure tool is a runner for Clojure programs.  clj is a wrapper
       for clojure that uses rlwrap to provide a better interactive
       experience.  Users will typically run clj.


EXAMPLES
       You can launch a Clojure REPL by running clj.

       See the Deps and CLI Guide below for more complex usage.


OPTIONS
       The clj and clojure scripts can take three types of options, as shown
       in the synopsis.  clj-opts are used to build the java-opts and
       classpath.  init-opts refer to Clojure code to execute.  main-opts are
       options to clojure.main.


   clj-opts
       -Jopt  Pass opt through in java_opts, ex: -J-Xmx512m


       -Aaliases
              Concatenated aliases for REPL execution, ex: -A:dev:mem


       -Xaliases_fn KPATH V
              Exec alias to invoke one or more functions that take a map, with
              keypath/value overrides. Function must either be supplied or be
              in :exec-fn argmap for alias


       -Maliases
              Exec clojure.main, either from opts in alias or command line


       -P     Prepare - download libs, cache classpath without executing


       -Sdeps EDN
              Deps data to use as the last deps file to be merged


       -Spath Compute classpath and echo to stdout only


       -Stree Print dependency tree


       -Scp CP
              Do NOT compute or cache classpath, use this one instead


       -Srepro
              Ignore the ~/.clojure/deps.edn config file


       -Sforce
              Force recomputation of the classpath (don't use the cache)


       -Sverbose
              Print important path info to console


       -Sdescribe
              Print environment and command parsing info as data


       -Sthreads N
              Set specific number of download threads


       -Strace
              Write a trace.edn file that traces deps expansion


       --     Stop parsing dep options and pass remaining arguments to
              clojure.main


       --version
              Write version to stdout and exit


       -version
              Write version to stderr and exit


   init-opts
       -i, --init path
              Load a file or resource located at path


       -e, --eval string
              Eval exprs in string; print non-nil values


       --report target
              Report uncaught exception to target: "file" (default), "stderr",
              or "none", overrides System property clojure.main.report


   main-opts
       -m, --main ns-name
              Call the -main function from namespace w/args


       -r, --repl
              Run a repl


       path   Run a script from a file or resource located at path


       -      Run a script from standard input


       -h, -?,  --help
              Print this help message and exit


CONFIGURATION
       This script reads configuration from deps.edn files. It will check
       against deps.edn files in the system root location, the user
       configuration directory (usually ~/.clojure), and the local directory.
       Files in each of these locations, if they exist, are merged to form one
       combined configuration file. The last specified configuration file's
       options overwrites any earlier files (e.g. local configs take
       priority).
