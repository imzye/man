TPM(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 TPM(4)

NAME
     tpm – Trusted Platform Module

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device tpm

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           tpm_load="YES"

     In /boot/device.hints:
     hint.tpm.0.at="isa"
     hint.tpm.0.maddr="0xfed40000"
     hint.tpm.0.msize="0x5000"
     hint.tpm.1.at="isa"
     hint.tpm.1.maddr="0xfed40000"
     hint.tpm.1.msize="0x1000"

DESCRIPTION
     The tpm driver provides support for various trusted platform modules
     (TPM) that can store cryptographic keys.

     Supported modules:

           •   Atmel 97SC3203
           •   Broadcom BCM0102
           •   Infineon IFX SLD 9630 TT 1.1 and IFX SLB 9635 TT 1.2
           •   Intel INTC0102
           •   Sinosun SNS SSX35
           •   STM ST19WP18
           •   Winbond WEC WPCT200

     The driver can be configured to use an IRQ by providing a free ISA
     interrupt vector in /boot/device.hints.
