ORPIE(1)                a console-based RPN calculator                ORPIE(1)

NAME
       orpie is a console-based RPN calculator with an interactive visual
       stack.

SYNOPSIS
       orpie

QUICK START
       CAUTION: while this manpage should be suitable as a quick reference, it
       may be subject to miscellaneous shortcomings in typesetting. The
       definitive documentation is the user manual provided with Orpie in PDF
       format.

       This section describes how to use Orpie in its default configuration.
       After familiarizing yourself with the basic operations as outlined in
       this section, you may wish to consult the orpierc(5) manpage to see how
       Orpie can be configured to better fit your needs.

   OVERVIEW
       The interface has two panels. The left panel combines status
       information with context-sensitive help; the right panel represents the
       calculator's stack. (Note that the left panel will be hidden if Orpie
       is run in a terminal with less than 80 columns.)

       In general, you perform calculations by first entering data on to the
       stack, then executing functions that operate on the stack data. As an
       example, you can hit 1<enter>2<enter>+ in order to add 1 and 2.

   ENTERING REAL NUMBERS
       To enter a real number, just type the desired digits and hit enter. The
       space bar will begin entry of a scientific notation exponent. The 'n'
       key is used for negation. Here are some examples:

       _ Keypresses            Resulting Entry
       _ 1.23<enter>           1.23
       1.23<space>23n<enter>   1.23e-23
       1.23n<space>23<enter>   -1.23e23
       _

   ENTERING COMPLEX NUMBERS
       Orpie can represent complex numbers using either cartesian
       (rectangular) or polar coordinates. See PERFORMING BASIC COMMAND
       OPERATIONS to see how to change the complex number display mode.

       A complex number is entered by first pressing '(', then entering the
       real part, then pressing ',' followed by the imaginary part.
       Alternatively, you can press '(' followed by the magnitude, then '<'
       followed by the phase angle. The angle will be interpreted in degrees
       or radians, depending on the current setting of the angle mode (see
       PERFORMING BASIC COMMAND OPERATIONS).  Examples:

       _ Keypresses                  Resulting Entry
       _ (1.23, 4.56<enter>          (1.23, 4.56)
       (0.7072<45<enter>             (0.500065915655126,
                                     0.50006591...
       (1.23n,4.56<space>10<enter>   (-1.23, 45600000000)
       _

   ENTERING MATRICES
       You can enter matrices by pressing '['. The elements of the matrix may
       then be entered as described in the previous sections, and should be
       separated using ','. To start a new row of the matrix, press '[' again.
       On the stack, each row of the matrix is enclosed in a set of brackets;
       for example, the matrix

       1   2
       3   4

       would appear on the stack as [[1, 2][3, 4]].

       Examples of matrix entry:

       _ Keypresses                   Resulting Entry
       _ [1,2[3,4<enter>              [[1, 2][3, 4]]
       [1.2<space>10,0[3n,5n<enter>   [[ 12000000000, 0 ][ -3,
                                      -5 ]]
       [(1,2,3,4[5,6,7,8<enter>       [[ (1, 2), (3, 4) ][ (5,
                                      6), (...
       _

   ENTERING DATA WITH UNITS
       Real and complex scalars and matrices can optionally be labeled with
       units. After typing in the numeric portion of the data, press '_'
       followed by a units string. The format of units strings is described in
       the UNITS FORMATTING section.

       Examples of entering dimensioned data:

       _ Keypresses              Resulting Entry
       _ 1.234_N*mm^2/s<enter>   1.234_N*mm^2*s^-1
       (2.3,5_s^-4<enter>        (2.3, 5)_s^-4
       [1,2[3,4_lbf*in<enter>    [[ 1, 2 ][ 3, 4 ]]_lbf*in
       _nm<enter>                1_nm
       _

   ENTERING EXACT INTEGERS
       An exact integer may be entered by pressing '#' followed by the desired
       digits. The base of the integer will be assumed to be the same as the
       current calculator base mode (see PERFORMING BASIC COMMAND OPERATIONS
       to see how to set this mode).  Alternatively, the desired base may be
       specified by pressing space and appending one of {b, o, d, h}, to
       represent binary, octal, decimal, or hexadecimal, respectively. On the
       stack, the representation of the integer will be changed to match the
       current base mode. Examples:

       _ Keypresses             Resulting Entry
       _ #123456<enter>         #123456`d
       #ffff<space>h<enter>     #65535`d
       #10101n<space>b<enter>   #-21`d
       _

       Note that exact integers may have unlimited length, and the basic
       arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
       will be performed using exact arithmetic when both arguments are
       integers.

   ENTERING VARIABLE NAMES
       A variable name may be entered by pressing '@' followed by the desired
       variable name string. The string may contain alphanumeric characters,
       dashes, and underscores. Example:

       _ Keypresses   Resulting Entry
       _ @myvar       @ myvar
       _

       Orpie also supports autocompletion of variable names. The help panel
       displays a list of pre-existing variables that partially match the name
       currently being entered.  You can press '<tab>' to iterate through the
       list of matching variables.

       As a shortcut, keys <f1>-<f4> will enter the variables (``registers'')
       @ r01 through @ r04.

   ENTERING PHYSICAL CONSTANTS
       Orpie includes definitions for a number of fundamental physical
       constants. To enter a constant, press 'C', followed by the first few
       letters/digits of the constant's symbol, then hit enter. Orpie offers
       an autocompletion feature for physical constants, so you only need to
       type enough of the constant to identify it uniquely. A list of matching
       constants will appear in the left panel of the display, to assist you
       in finding the desired choice.

       The following is a list of Orpie's physical constant symbols:

       _ Symbol   Physical Constant
       _ NA       Avagadro's number
       k          Boltzmann constant
       Vm         molar volume
       R          universal gas constant
       stdT       standard temperature
       stdP       standard pressure
       sigma      Stefan-Boltzmann constant
       c          speed of light
       eps0       permittivity of free space
       u0         permeability of free space
       g          acceleration of gravity
       G          Newtonian gravitational
                  constant
       h          Planck's constant
       hbar       Dirac's constant
       e          electron charge
       me         electron mass
       mp         proton mass
       alpha      fine structure constant
       phi        magnetic flux quantum
       F          Faraday's constant
       Rinf       ``infinity'' Rydberg
                  constant
       a0         Bohr radius
       uB         Bohr magneton
       uN         nuclear magneton
       lam0       wavelength of a 1eV photon
       f0         frequency of a 1eV photon
       lamc       Compton wavelength
       c3         Wien's constant
       _

       All physical constants are defined in the Orpie run-configuration file;
       consult the orpierc(5) manpage if you wish to define your own constants
       or change the existing definitions.

   ENTERING DATA WITH AN EXTERNAL EDITOR
       Orpie can also parse input entered via an external editor. You may find
       this to be a convenient method for entering large matrices. Pressing
       'E' will launch the external editor, and the various data types may be
       entered as illustrated by the examples below:

       _ Data Type       Sample Input String
       _ exact integer   #12345678`d, where the
                         trailing  letter is one of
                         the base characters {b, o,
                         d, h}
       real number       -123.45e67
       complex number    (1e10, 2) or (1 <90)
       real matrix       [[1, 2][3.1, 4.5e10]]
       complex matrix    [[(1, 0), 5][1e10, (2
                         <90)]]
       variable          @myvar
       _

       Real and complex numbers and matrices may have units appended; just add
       a units string such as ``_N*m/s'' immediately following the numeric
       portion of the expression.

       Notice that the complex matrix input parser is quite flexible; real and
       complex matrix elements may be mixed, and cartesian and polar complex
       formats may be mixed as well.

       Multiple stack entries may be specified in the same file, if they are
       separated by whitespace. For example, entering (1, 2) 1.5 into the
       editor will cause the complex value (1, 2) to be placed on the stack,
       followed by the real value 1.5.

       The input parser will discard whitespace where possible, so feel free
       to add any form of whitespace between matrix rows, matrix elements,
       real and complex components, etc.

   EXECUTING BASIC FUNCTION OPERATIONS
       Once some data has been entered on the stack, you can apply operations
       to that data. For example, '+' will add the last two elements on the
       stack. By default, the following keys have been bound to such
       operations:

       _ Keys                      Operations
       _ +                         add last two stack
                                   elements
       -                           subtract element 1 from
                                   element 2
       *                           multiply last two stack
                                   elements
       /                           divide element 2 by
                                   element 1
       ^T}&T{ raise element 2 to
       the power of element 1
       n                           negate last element
       i                           invert last element
       s                           square root function
       a                           absolute value function
       e                           exponential function
       l                           natural logarithm function
       c                           complex conjugate function
       !                           factorial function
       %T}&T{ element 2 mod
       element 1
       S                           store element 2 in
                                   (variable) element 1
       ;                           evaluate variable to
                                   obtain contents
       _

       As a shortcut, function operators will automatically enter any data
       that you were in the process of entering. So instead of the sequence
       2<enter>2<enter>+, you could type simply 2<enter>2+ and the second
       number would be entered before the addition operation is applied.

       As an additional shortcut, any variable names used as function
       arguments will be evaluated before application of the function. In
       other words, it is not necessary to evaluate variables before
       performing arithmetic operations on them.

   EXECUTING FUNCTION ABBREVIATIONS
       One could bind nearly all calculator operations to specific keypresses,
       but this would rapidly get confusing since the PC keyboard is not
       labeled as nicely as a calculator keyboard is. For this reason, Orpie
       includes an abbreviation syntax.

       To activate an abbreviation, press ''' (quote key), followed by the
       first few letters/digits of the abbreviation, then hit enter. Orpie
       offers an autocompletion feature for abbreviations, so you only need to
       type enough of the operation to identify it uniquely. The matching
       abbreviations will appear in the left panel of the display, to assist
       you in finding the appropriate operation.

       To avoid interface conflicts, abbreviations may be entered only when
       the entry buffer (the bottom line of the screen) is empty.

       The following functions are available as abbreviations:

       _ Abbreviations   Functions
       _ inv             inverse function
       pow               raise element 2 to the

       Entering abbreviations can become tedious when performing repetitive
       calculations.  To save some keystrokes, Orpie will automatically bind
       recently-used operations with no prexisting binding to keys <f5>-<f12>.
       The current autobindings can be viewed by pressing 'h' to cycle between
       the various pages of the help panel.

   EXECUTING BASIC COMMAND OPERATIONS
       In addition to the function operations listed in the section EXECUTING
       BASIC FUNCTION OPERATIONS, a number of basic calculator commands have
       been bound to single keypresses:

       _ Keys                       Operations
       _ \T}&T{ drop last element

       <enter>                      duplicate last element
                                    (when entry buffer is
                                    empty)

       E                            create a new stack element
                                    using an external editor

       Q                            quit Orpie
       _

   EXECUTING COMMAND ABBREVIATIONS
       In addition to the function operations listed in the section EXECUTING
       FUNCTION ABBREVIATIONS, there are a large number of calculator commands
       that have been implemented using the abbreviation syntax:

       _ Abbreviations   Calculator Operation
       _ drop            drop last element
       clear             clear all stack elements

                         between 0 and 1 (uniformly
                         distributed)

       about             display a nifty ``About
                         Orpie'' screen
       quit              quit Orpie
       _

   BROWSING THE STACK
       Orpie offers a stack browsing mode to assist in viewing and
       manipulating stack data. Press <up> to enter stack browsing mode; this
       should highlight the last stack element. You can use the up and down
       arrow keys to select different stack elements. The following keys are
       useful in stack browsing mode:

       _ Keys    Operations
       _ q       quit stack browsing mode
       <left>    scroll selected entry to
                 the left
       <right>   scroll selected entry to
                 the right
       r         cyclically ``roll'' stack
                 elements downward, below
                 the selected element
                 (inclusive)
       R         cyclically ``roll'' stack
                 elements upward, below the
                 selected element
                 (inclusive)
       v         view the currently
                 selected element in a
                 fullscreen editor
       E         edit the currently
                 selected element with an
                 external editor
       <enter>   duplicate the currently
                 selected element
       _

       The left and right scrolling option may prove useful for viewing very
       lengthy stack entries, such as large matrices. The edit option provides
       a convenient way to correct data after it has been entered on the
       stack.

   UNITS FORMATTING
       A units string is a list of units separated by '*' to indicate
       multiplication and '/' to indicate division. Units may be raised to
       real-valued powers using the '^'character. A contrived example of a
       valid unit string would be "N*nm^2*kg/s/in^-3*GHz^2.34".

       Orpie supports the standard SI prefix set, {y, z, a, f, p, n, u, m, c,
       d, da, h, k, M, G, T, P, E, Z, Y} (note the use of 'u' for micro-).
       These prefixes may be applied to any of the following exhaustive sets
       of units:

       _ String   Length Unit
       _ m        meter
       ft         foot
       in         inch
       yd         yard
       mi         mile
       pc         parsec
       AU         astronomical unit

       _ String   Time Unit
       _ s        second
       min        minute
       hr         hour
       day        day

       _ String   Temperature Unit
       _ K        Kelvin
       R          Rankine
       _

       Note: No, Celsius and Fahrenheit will not be supported. Because these
       temperature units do not share a common zero point, their behavior is
       ill-defined under many operations.

       _ String   ``Amount of Substance''
                  Unit
       _ mol      Mole
       _

       _ cd       candela
       lm         lumen
       lx         lux
       _

       Note: Although the lumen is defined by 1_lm = 1_cd * sr, Orpie drops
       the steridian because it is a dimensionless unit and therefore is of
       questionable use to a calculator.

       _ String   Volume Unit
       _ ozfl     fluid ounce (US)
       cup        cup (US)
       pt         pint (US)
       qt         quart (US)
       gal        gallon (US)
       L          liter
       _

       All units are defined in the Orpie run-configuration file; consult the
       orpierc(5) manpage if you wish to define your own units or change the
       existing definitions.
