NAME
       japana - HTTP proxy converting Japanese characters into ASCII

SYNOPSIS
       japana [ --addr addr ] [ --auth ] [ --configfile configfile ]
       [ --kakasioptions options ] [ --port port ] [ --proxy proxy ]
       [ --userfile userfile ] [ --version ]

       japana [ -a addr ] [ -A ] [ -c configfile ] [ -o options ] [ -p port ]
       [ -P proxy ] [ -u userfile ] [ -V ]

OVERVIEW
       japana is a small and simple proxy written in Perl.  The proxy converts
       Japanese characters (Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji etc.) into ASCII
       (Romaji) on the fly.  The conversion is done using the KAKASI library.

DESCRIPTION
       Just start japana.  This will by default create a proxy running on
       http://localhost:8080 (it will fail if something else is already
       running on this port).  Then point your browser to the proxy.  Browse
       some Japanese website (e.g. http://amazon.co.jp) and see all those
       Japanese characters converted to plain ascii text.

   Switches
       --addr addr | -a addr
            This is the IP address that japana will bind to.  This address
            (together with the correct port) must be configured in your
            browser to make use of the japana proxy.

            Be careful: Everybody who can reach the japana port on this
            address can use your proxy.  Consider enabling authentication
            (--auth option).  You might also bind to an address only reachable
            from your local net or use a packet filter to 'guard' japana from
            the outside.

            The address '0.0.0.0' will bind japana to all of your network
            devices.

            Default is to bind to address '127.0.0.1' as this address can only
            be accessed from your local computer and is not accessible from
            the network.  Please take care when binding to another address.

       --auth | -A
            This enables the "basic proxy authentication scheme" as described
            in RFC 2617.  If enabled, you must enter a valid username and
            password before you can use the japana proxy.  Note that the
            passwords are not encrypted in any way, so don't use important
            ones.

            Default is to use no authentication.

       --configfile configfile | -c configfile
            The options from the given configuration file will be read.  These
            options can be overridden by other command line arguments.

            Default is not to read a configuration file.

       --kakasioptions options | -o options
            These options are passed directly to kakasi and affect the
            conversion process.  See the kakasi documentation for details.

            Default options are '-ja -ga -ka -Ea -Ka -Ha -Ja -U -s' and should
            be reasonable.

       --port port | -p port
            This is the port on which japana listens to your incoming
            requests.  This port (together with the correct address) must be
            configured in your browser to make use of the japana proxy.

            Default setting is port 8080.

       --proxy proxy | -P proxy
            If this variable contains a value, the given proxy is used by
            japana.  This allows you to chain multiple proxies together.

            Example: If you need a proxy to access the Internet then point
            your browser to the japana proxy and in turn point japana to your
            original proxy.

            Set this to 'none' to use no proxy at all.

            Default is to use the environment variable ${http_proxy}.

       --userfile userfile | -u userfile
            This file contains the usernames and passwords to use when
            authentication is enabled.

            Default userfile is '/usr/local/etc/japana.users'.

       --version | -V
            This prints the current version of japana and exits.

   Configuration file format
       Configuration is also possible via configuration files.  Every command
       line switch is possible in a configuration file.  Empty lines and lines
       starting with # are ignored.

       Instead of --port 3128 you would put this line in the configuration
       file:

        port = 3128

       -o '-ja -ga -ka -U -s' will become

        kakasioptions = -ja -ga -ka -U -s

       and so on and so forth.

   Userfile file format
       This file contains the usernames and passwords used for authentication.
       Every line must contain one username and the corresponding password
       separated by a colon.  Empty lines and lines starting with # are
       ignored.

       This example file contains the user 'japana' with the password
       'simple':

        # This is just an example.
        # Consider changing your password before using japana.
        japana:simple

MODULES NEEDED
        use AppConfig;
        use HTTP::Daemon;
        use LWP::UserAgent;
        use Text::Kakasi;

       These modules can be obtained at <http://www.cpan.org> and Text::Kakasi
       can be found here: <http://www.daionet.gr.jp/~knok/kakasi/>.

       If setting up kakasi is too complicated, you might try the old 1.0.x
       version of japana.  It does not use kakasi (and because of that can't
       convert Kanji).

OPTIONAL MODULES
        use Compress::Zlib;

       This module can be obtained at <http://www.cpan.org>.

       When this module is installed, gzipped data transfer is available
       between your browser, japana and web servers.

BUGS
       In the default configuration, japana supports NO ACCESS CONTROL!
       Everyone with access to the japana port on your system will be able to
       use the proxy.  Please consider the use of password authentication
       (--auth) or bind japana to a port that is either only available from
       your local network or protected by a packet filter.

       Please report bugs the project website <http://sf.net/projects/japana/>
       or send a mail to <japana-bugs@cgarbs.de>.
