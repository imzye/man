NAME
       exonerate-server - a sequence comparison server for exonerate


SYNOPSIS
       exonerate-server [ options ] <index path>


DESCRIPTION
       exonerate-server is a multi-threaded server for the exonerate sequence
       alignment program.

       It uses a set of sequences and a corresponding index file to allow fast
       of large datasets.


OVERVIEW
       Firstly, an .esd file must be made from the sequence files.  The .esd
       file is an Exonerate Sequence Dataset file, and can be used to group
       together any set of sequences where each sequences containing unique
       identifiers.  This is done by using the fasta2esd utility.

              fasta2esd genome.fasta genome.esd

       Next, an .esi file my be made from the .esd file.  The .esi file is an
       Exonerate Sequence Index file, and contains an index or set of indices
       corresponding to a particular dataset.  This is done by using the
       esd2esi utility.

              esd2esi genome.esd genome.esi

       Once the .esi file has been generated, the exonerate-server may be
       started.

              exonerate-server genome.esi

       While the server is running, exonerate may be used to query the server
       by replacing the target sequences in the command line with the name of
       the server and port number.  The default port number for the exonerate-
       server is 12886.

OPTIONS
       Some of the command line options for the exonerate-server are the same
       as for the exonerate client, and these are documented in the man page
       for exonerate.  The other options which are specific to
       exonerate-server are documented here.

       --port <port>
              Specify the port on which the server should listen.  By default,
              exonerate-server will listen on port 12886, but alternative
              ports may be specified with this option.

       --input <index file>
              Specify the index file to be used when the server is started.
              This option is mandatory.  The index file is a .esi file
              generated by the esd2esi utility.

       --preload <boolean>
              By default the indices contained in the .esi file, and the
              sequences referenced in the corresponding .esd file are loaded
              into memory when the server is started.  This is necessary to
              achieve fast performance that would otherwise be hampered by
              frequent disk accesses.  This option allows the index and
              sequence preloading to be turned off, which allows the server to
              run much more slowly, but with faster startup and a smaller
              memory footprint.  It is not advised to turn preloading off
              unless testing or debugging the server.

       --maxconnections <count>
              The server is multithreaded.  This option sets the number client
              processes which are allowed to connect to the server
              simultaneously.  For good performance, it should not be set to
              more than the number of CPUs on the machine on which the server
              is running.

       --verbosity <level>
              Set the verbosity level for the server.  If it is zero, the
              server will be silent, and the higher the number, the more
              messages are reported by the server about what is happening.


INTERFACE
       This section documents the communication interface between the client
       and server.  The interface is documented for people wishing to write
       their own custom server to sit behind exonerate - for normal use of
       exonerate, it is not necessary to know this.

       The interface works by the client sending simple command lines and the
       server sending simple reply lines over a socket.  All the commands and
       replies are simple lines of ASCII text, so it is possible to use telnet
       as a client for testing a server.

       Any command is a single line of text, but a reply may contain many
       lines of text.  The replies are in the form of <tag>: <message>

       Any reply can include lines with the tag warning: or error: These
       warning: and error: tags are echoed by the client, and the client will
       exit after receiving any error: reply.

       When the server is returning a multiline reply, the first line must
       show the number of lines in the whole reply as: linecount: <count> For
       examples, see the replies from the get hsps commands in the example
       session below.

       The client will only open a single connection to any server, although a
       multithreaded server is obviously required to allow multiple clients to
       connect simultaneously.

   Commands and replies used in for the interface.
       Command:  version
       Reply:    version <server name> <server version>

       Command:  exit
       Reply:    ( no reply - server closes connection )

       Command:  dbinfo
       Reply:    dbinfo: <type> <masked> <num_seqs> <max_seq_len>
                 <total_seq_len>

                 The dbinfo command returns information about the database
                 loaded on the server.  The returned fields are:

                 <type>          either dna or protein
                 <masked>        either softmasked or unmasked
                 <num_seqs>      the number of sequences in the database
                 <max_seq_len>   the length of the longest sequence in the
                                 database
                 <total_seq_len> the total length of all the sequences in the
                                 database

       Command:  lookup <eid>
       Reply:    lookup: <iid>

                 The lookup command is used to map an external identifier to
                 an internal identifier.

       Command:  get info <iid>
       Reply:    seqinfo: <len> <checksum> <eid> [ <def> ]

                 The get info command returns information about a sequence in
                 the database.  The returned fields are:

                 <len>           the sequence length
                 <checksum>      a gcg format checksum (see below)
                 <eid>           the external id (eg. from fasta header)
                 <def>           a description line for the sequence (also
                                 from the fasta header), this field is
                                 optional an may be ommitted.

       Command:  get seq <iid>
       Reply:    seq: <seq>

                 The get seq command returns a whole sequence on one line.

       Command:  get subseq <iid> <start> <len>
       Reply:    subseq: <sequence>

                 The get subseq command returns part of a sequence.  The start
                 of the sequence is position zero.  eg. get subseq 0 0 10 will
                 return the first 10 bases of the first sequence in the
                 database.

       Command:  set query <seq>
       Reply:    ok: <len> <checksum>

                 The seq query command is used to send a query sequence to the
                 server.  It returns the length of the sequence and a gcg
                 checksum

       Command:  revcomp <query | target>
       Reply:    ok: <query | target> strand <forward | revcomp>

                 The revcomp query command makes the server reverse complement
                 the query.  This is to save the bandwidth of sending the
                 query twice.

                 The revcomp target command is to tell the server to treat the
                 database as its reverse complement.  The client only sends
                 this command when searching a translated database, so need
                 not be implemented for most types of search.

       Command:  set param <name> <value>
       Reply:    ok: <set | ignored>

                 The set parameter command sends parameters from the exonerate
                 command line to the server.  This commands can all be ignored
                 by the client for a basic implementation, but cannot be
                 ignored for optimal performance.

       Command:  get hsps
       Reply:    hspset: <iid> { <query_pos> <target_pos> <length> }
       Or:       hspset: empty

                 The get hsps command is the main command for getting sets of
                 hsps.  The server may return multiple hspsets.  The returned
                 fields are:

                 <iid>           The internal id of the target sequence for
                                 these HSPsets.
                 <query_pos>     The hsp query start position
                 <target_pos>    The hsp target start position
                 <length>        The hsp length

                 The last three fields represent an HSP, and may be repeated
                 many times on one hspset: reply line.
