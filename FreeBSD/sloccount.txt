       sloccount [--version] [--cached] [--append] [ --datadir directory ]
       [--follow] [--duplicates] [--crossdups] [--autogen] [--multiproject]
       [--filecount] [--wide] [--details] [ --effort F E ] [ --schedule F E ]
       [ --personcost cost ] [ --overhead overhead ] [ --addlang language ] [
       --addlangall ] [--] directories

DESCRIPTION
       sloccount counts the physical source lines of code (SLOC) contained in
       descendants of the specified set of directories.  It automatically
       determines which files are source code files, and it automatically
       determines the computer language used in each file.  By default it
       summarizes the SLOC results and presents various estimates (such as
       effort and cost to develop), but its output can be controlled by
       various options.

       If you give sloccount a list of two or more directories, the counts
       will be broken up according to that list.  There is one important
       limitation: the basenames of the directories given as parameters must
       be different, because those names are used to group summary
       information.  Thus, you can't run "sloccount /usr/src/hello
       /usr/local/src/hello".  This limitation only applies to parameters of
       sloccount - subdirectories descended from the top directories can have
       the same basename.

       If you give sloccount only a single directory, sloccount tries to
       automatically find a reasonable breakdown for purposes of reporting (so
       it'll produce a useful report).  In this case, if the directory has at
       least two subdirectories, then those subdirectories will be used as the
       breakdown.  If the single directory contains files as well as
       directories (or if you give sloccount some files as parameters), those
       files will be assigned to the directory "top_dir" so you can tell them
       apart from other contents.  Finally, if there's a subdirectory named
       "src", then that subdirectory is again broken down, with all the
       further subdirectories prefixed with "src_".  Thus, if directory "X"
       has a subdirectory "src", which contains subdirectory "modules",
       sloccount will report a separate count for "src_modules".

       sloccount normally considers all descendants of these directories,
       though unless told otherwise it ignores symbolic links.

       sloccount is the usual front-end of the package of tools named
       "SLOCCount".  Note that the name of the entire package has capital
       letters, while the name of this front-end program does not.

       sloccount will normally report estimates of schedule time, effort, and
       cost, and for single projects it also estimates the average number of
       active developers.  These are merely estimates, not etched in stone;
       you can modify the parameters used to improve the estimates.



OPTIONS
       --version   Report the version number of SLOCCount and immediately
                   exit.  This option can't be usefully combined with any
                   other option.


       --cached    Do not recalculate; instead, use cached results from a
                   previous execution.  Without the --cached or --append
                   option, sloccount automatically removes the data directory
                   and recreates it.


       --append    Do not remove previous calculations from the data
                   directory; instead, add the analysis to the current
                   contents of the data directory.


       --datadir directory
                   Store or use cached data in the given data directory;
                   default value is "~/.slocdata".


       --follow    Follow symbolic links.


       --duplicates
                   Count all duplicates.  Normally, if files have equal
                   content (as determined using MD5 hash values), only one is
                   counted.


       --crossdups Count duplicates if they occur in different portions of the
                   breakdown.  Thus, if the top directory contains many
                   different projects, and you want the duplicates in
                   different projects to count in each project, choose this
                   option.


       --autogen   Count source code files that appear to be automatically
                   generated.  Normally these are excluded.


       --multiproject
                   The different directories represent different projects;
                   otherwise, it's assumed that all of the source code belongs
                   to a single project.  This doesn't change the total number
                   of files or SLOC values, but it does affect the effort and
                   schedule estimates.  Given this option, effort is computed
                   separately for each project (and then summed), and the
                   schedule is the estimated schedule of the largest project.


       --filecount Display counts of files instead of SLOC.


       --wide      Display in the "wide" (tab-separated) format.


       --details   Display details, that is, results for every source code
                   file.


       --effort F E
                   Change the factor and exponent for the effort model.
                   Effort (in person-months) is computed as F*(SLOC/1000)^E.


       --schedule F E
                   Change the factor and exponent for the schedule model.
                   Schedule (in months) is computed as F*(effort)^E.


       --personcost cost
                   Change the average annual salary to cost.


       --overhead overhead
                   Change the overhead value to overhead.  Estimated cost is
                   computed as effort * personcost * overhead.


       --addlang language
                   Add a language not considered by default to be a
                   ``language'' to be reported.  Currently the only legal
                   values for language are "makefile", "sql", and "html".
                   These files are not normally included in the SLOC counts,
                   although their SLOCs are internally calculated and they are
                   shown in the file counts.  If you want to include more than
                   one such language, do it by passing --addlang more than
                   once, e.g., --addlang makefile --addlang sql.


       --addlangall
                   Add all languages not normally included in final reports.


NOTES
       As with many other programs using Unix-like options, directories whose
       names begin with a dash (``-'') can be misinterpreted as options.  If
       the directories to be analyzed might begin with a dash, use the double-
       dash (``- -'') to indicate the end of the option list before listing
       the directories.


BUGS
       Filenames with embedded newlines (in the directories or their
       descendants) won't be handled correctly; they will be interpreted as
       separate filenames where the newlines are inserted.  An attacker could
       prevent sloccount from working by creating filenames of the form
       /normal/directory ... NEWLINE/dev/zero.  Such filenames are exceedingly
       rare in source code because they're a pain to work with using other
       tools, too.  Future versions of sloccount may internally use NUL-
       separated filenames (like GNU find's -print0 command) to fix this.

       There are many more languages not yet handled by SLOCCount.

       SLOCCount only reports physical source lines of code.  It would be very
       useful if it could also report logical lines of code, and perhaps other
       common metrics such as McCabe's complexity measures and complexity
       density (complexity/SLOC for each function or procedure).
