NAME
       GraphQL - Perl implementation of GraphQL

SYNOPSIS
         use GraphQL::Schema;
         use GraphQL::Type::Object;
         use GraphQL::Type::Scalar qw($String);
         use GraphQL::Execution qw(execute);

         my $schema = GraphQL::Schema->from_doc(<<'EOF');
         type Query {
           helloWorld: String
         }
         EOF
         post '/graphql' => sub {
           send_as JSON => execute(
             $schema,
             body_parameters->{query},
             { helloWorld => 'Hello world!' },
             undef,
             body_parameters->{variables},
             body_parameters->{operationName},
             undef,
           );
         };

       The above is from the sample Dancer 2 applet
       <https://github.com/graphql-perl/sample-dancer2>.

DESCRIPTION
       This module is a port of the GraphQL reference implementation, graphql-
       js <https://github.com/graphql-js/graphql-js>, to Perl 5.

       It now supports Promises, allowing asynchronous operation. See
       Mojolicious::Plugin::GraphQL for an example of how to take advantage of
       this.

       As of 0.39, supports GraphQL subscriptions.

       See GraphQL::Type for description of how to create GraphQL types.

   Introduction to GraphQL
       GraphQL is a technology that lets clients talk to APIs via a single
       endpoint, which acts as a single "source of the truth". This means
       clients do not need to seek the whole picture from several APIs.
       Additionally, it makes this efficient in network traffic, time, and
       programming effort:

       Network traffic
           The request asks for exactly what it wants, which it gets, and no
           more. No wasted traffic.

       Time
           It gets all the things it needs in one go, including any connected
           resources, so it does not need to make several requests to fill its
           information requirement.

       Programming effort
           With "fragments" that can be attached to user-interface components,
           keeping track of what information a whole page needs to request can
           be automated. See Relay <https://facebook.github.io/relay/> or
           Apollo <http://dev.apollodata.com/> for more on this.

   Basic concepts
       GraphQL implements a system featuring a schema, which features various
       classes of types, some of which are objects. Special objects provide
       the roots of queries (mandatory), and mutations and subscriptions (both
       optional).

       Objects have fields, each of which can be specified to take arguments,
       and which have a return type. These are effectively the properties
       and/or methods on the type. If they return an object, then a query can
       specify subfields of that object, and so on - as alluded to in the
       "time-saving" point above.

       For more, see the JavaScript tutorial in "SEE ALSO".

   Hooking your system up to GraphQL
       You will need to decide how to model your system in GraphQL terms. This
       will involve deciding on what output object types you have, what fields
       they have, and what arguments and return-types those fields have.

       Additionally, you will need to design mutations if you want to be able
       to update/create/delete data. This requires some thought for return
       types, to ensure you can get all the information you need to proceed to
       avoid extra round-trips.

       The easiest way to achieve these things is to make a
       GraphQL::Plugin::Convert subclass, to encapsulate the specifics of your
       system. See the documentation for further information.

       Finally, you should consider whether you need "subscriptions". These
       are designed to hook into WebSockets. Apollo has a JavaScript module
       <https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-subscriptions> for this.

       Specifying types and fields is straightforward. See the document for
       how to make resolvers.
