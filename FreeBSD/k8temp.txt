K8TEMP(8)               FreeBSD System Manager's Manual              K8TEMP(8)

NAME
     k8temp – display on-die temperature readings from AMD K8 and K10
     processors

SYNOPSIS
     k8temp [-nd] [selector ...] | [-v | -h]

DESCRIPTION
     The k8temp utility displays temperature readings from AMD K8 and K10
     processors using their on-die thermal diode(s).

     k8temp requires read-write access to /dev/pci, and thus must be run as
     root.

     The following options are available:

     -v      Display version and copyright information.

     -h      Display help text.

     -n      Show only temperature values.

     -d      Display debug information, including raw register contents and
             interpreted subvalues, and an Advanced Power Management feature
             dump.

     Selectors specify which CPU, core and sensor to read, and are of the form
     cpu[:core[:sensor]].  Note, output order is fixed, and not (yet) defined
     by the order of selectors.

EXAMPLES
     k8temp 1:0:0
              Display reading for CPU1, core 0, sensor 0.

     k8temp 1:0
              Display reading for CPU1, core 0, all available sensors.

     k8temp -d 0 2
              Display reading for CPU 0 and CPU2, all available cores and
              sensors.  Display debug output.

BUGS
     k8temp may cause unsupported systems to reboot, crash or explode.

     Core numbers on single core systems may be incorrect (e.g. core 1 but no
     core 0).

     Running multiple copies of k8temp at once could result in readings being
     taken from incorrect cores.

     Readings from K10's are experimental.  Limited testing suggests they're
     10-20 degrees too low.

HISTORY
     0.1.0, 2007-10-21
             First release.

     0.1.1, 2007-10-22
             Fixes a serious error resulting in writes to a bogus PCI
             register.

     0.2.0, 2007-10-25
             Add support for diode offset correction and debugging options.
             Add CPUID check.

     0.3.0, 2007-12-04
             Add tentative support for OpenBSD and NetBSD.  Remove
             (meaningless) diode offset correction.  Introduce value-only
             output mode and sensor selector arguments.

     0.4.0, 2008-06-22
             Add preliminary K10 (Barcelona/Phenom) support.
