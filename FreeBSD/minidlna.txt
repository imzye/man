NAME
       minidlna

DESCRIPTION
       minidlna is a light weight but very functional DLNA server. In most
       cases, the defaults do not need modifications. The global configuration
       file is /etc/minidlna.conf but local users without system root access
       can run minidlna with their own configuration file.


OPTIONS
       The following are user configurable options in /etc/minidlna.conf.
       minidlna runs by default as user nobody, so make sure system
       permissions are set correctly for read access to media and write access
       to cache and log dirs.


       friendly_name
              The name you want your media server seen as, EG:
              friendly_name=Home Media Server


       port
              Port for HTTP (descriptions, SOAP, media transfer) traffic etc, defaults to 8200.
              There should be no need to change this.


       network_interface
              Network interfaces to serve, comma delimited. Maximum is 8
              interfaces. Defaults to all.


       strict_dlna
              Set this to strictly adhere to DLNA standards.
              This will allow server-side downscaling of very large JPEG images,
              which may hurt JPEG serving performance on (at least) Sony DLNA products.


       notify_interval
              Notify interval in seconds. The default is 895 seconds.



       minissdpdsocket
              Specify the path to the MiniSSDPd socket,
              EG: minissdpdsocket=/var/run/minissdpd.sock


       serial
              Serial number the daemon will report to clients in its XML description.
              Defaults to 12345678


       model
              Model number the daemon will report to clients in its XML description.
              Defaults to 1


       media_dir
              Path to the directory containing the media files minidlna should share.
              Use this option multile times if you have more than one directory to share.

              Example:
               media_dir=/opt/multimedia/videos
               media_dir=/opt/multimedia/movies

       You can also restrict an entry to a specific media type, you do this by
       using the following syntax:
          the letter 'A', 'V' or 'P', followed by a comma (',') followed by the path.
          The meaning of the first letter is as follows:
                             'A' for audio files
                             'V' for video files
                             'P' for image files

           For example, if you want to include only video files located
           in /opt/multimedia/videos directory, and only music
           in /opt/multimedia/music, then you would use
                              media_dir=V,/opt/multimedia/videos
                              media_dir=A,/opt/multimedia/music

           Another example would be
                              media_dir=V,/opt/multimedia/videos
                              media_dir=V,/opt/multimedia/movies
                              media_dir=A,/opt/multimedia/music

           Or, if you did not care what type it finds, then you could use
                              media_dir=/opt/multimedia/videos
                              media_dir=/opt/multimedia/movies
                              media_dir=/opt/multimedia/music

           You can mix it up, find anything in music, but only Videos, in videos and movies
                              media_dir=V,/opt/multimedia/videos
                              media_dir=V,/opt/multimedia/movies
                              media_dir=/opt/multimedia/music



       presentation_url
              Default presentation url is http address on port 80
              EG: presentation_url=http://www.mediaserver.lan/index.php


       db_dir Where minidlna stores the data files, including Album cache
              files, by default this is /var/cache/minidlna


       log_dir
              Path to the directory where the log file upnp-av.log should be
              stored, this defaults to /var/log


       log_level
              Set this to change the verbosity of the information that is
              logged each section can use a different level: off, fatal,
              error, warn, info, or debug

              Example
              log_level=general,artwork,database,inotify,scanner,metadata,http,ssdp,tivo=warn


       inotify
              Set to 'yes' to enable inotify monitoring of the files under
              media_dir to automatically discover new files. Set to 'no' to
              disable inotify.


       album_art_names
              This should be a list of file names to check for when searching
              for album art and names should be delimited with a forward slash
              ("/").

              Example
              album_art_names=Cover.jpg/cover.jpg/AlbumArtSmall.jpg/albumartsmall.jpg/AlbumArt.jpg
              /albumart.jpg/Album.jpg/album.jpg/Folder.jpg/folder.jpg/Thumb.jpg/thumb.jpg



       enable_tivo
              Set this to yes to enable support for streaming .jpg and .mp3
              files to a TiVo supporting HMO, default is no.


       tivo_discovery
              Set this to 'beacon' to use the legacy TiVo broadcast discovery
              method. Defaults to using Bonjour if Avahi support is available.


       root_container
              Use a different container as the root of the tree exposed to
              clients.
              The possible values are:
                           '.' to use the standard container (this is the default)
                           'B' to use the "Browse Directory" container;
                           'M' to use the "Music" container;
                           'V' to use the "Video" container;
                           'P' to use the "Pictures" container.
                If you specify 'B' and the client device is audio only, then
                "Music/Folders" will be used as root container and you wont see Videos.


       force_sort_criteria
              Always force SortCriteria to this value, regardless of the
              SortCriteria passed by the client.
              You may prepend the sort criteria with "!" to alter the titles of the objects so that they
              will be alphanumerically sorted in the order you specify here, to work around clients that do
              their own alphanumeric sorting.

              Example
              force_sort_criteria=+upnp:class,+upnp:originalTrackNumber,+dc:title



       wide_links
              Set to 'yes' to allow symlinks that point outside user-defined
              media_dirs.  By default, wide symlinks are not followed.


       enable_subtitles
              Set to 'no' to disable subtitle support on unknown clients.  By
              default, subtitles are enabled for unknown or generic clients.
