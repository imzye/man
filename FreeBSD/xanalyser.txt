NAME
       xanalyser - a frequence spectrum analyser for X


SYNOPSIS
       xanalyser [options]


DESCRIPTION
       The program xanalyser reads audio data from the soundcard, performs a
       fast fourier transformation on these data and displays the resulting
       spectrum in a X Window.

       It has no facilities to control the audio mixer. This must be done by
       another program.


OPTIONS
       -rate int
               Set the sample rate. The possible values are limited by your
               soundcard.

       -length int
               Set the length of each set of sampled data. The length must be
               a power of two and is limited by your soundsystem.

       -resolution int
               Set the sample resolution. Must be 16 or 32, but not all values
               are supported by all sound srivers.

       -device string
               Sets the audio device. This also automatically select the sound
               driver. Devices names starting with "/dev/" use the OSS driver
               and names starting with "plughw:" use the ALSA 0.9 driver. Some
               drivers may not be available on your system.

       -soundcard
               Select the soundcard as input.

       -diskfile
               Select a diskfile as input. Use the option filename to specify
               the name of the file.

       -filename string
               Selects the file to play. The file must be 2 channels, 16 bits,
               44100 Hz and in CDR or WAV format. Note: This is mainly
               intended for testing.
