GSS_VERIFY_MIC(3)   FreeBSD Library Functions Manual (prm)   GSS_VERIFY_MIC(3)

NAME
     gss_verify_mic, gss_verify – Check a MIC against a message; verify
     integrity of a received message

SYNOPSIS
     #include <gssapi/gssapi.h>

     OM_uint32
     gss_verify_mic(OM_uint32 *minor_status,
         const gss_ctx_id_t context_handle, const gss_buffer_t message_buffer,
         const gss_buffer_t token_buffer, gss_qop_t *qop_state);

     OM_uint32
     gss_verify(OM_uint32 *minor_status, gss_ctx_id_t context_handle,
         gss_buffer_t message_buffer, gss_buffer_t token_buffer,
         gss_qop_t *qop_state);

DESCRIPTION
     Verifies that a cryptographic MIC, contained in the token parameter, fits
     the supplied message.  The qop_state parameter allows a message recipient
     to determine the strength of protection that was applied to the message.

     Since some application-level protocols may wish to use tokens emitted by
     gss_wrap() to provide "secure framing", implementations must support the
     calculation and verification of MICs over zero-length messages.

     The gss_verify() routine is an obsolete variant of gss_verify_mic().  It
     is provided for backwards compatibility with applications using the GSS-
     API V1 interface.  A distinct entrypoint (as opposed to #define) is
     provided, both to allow GSS-API V1 applications to link and to retain the
     slight parameter type differences between the obsolete versions of this
     routine and its current form.

PARAMETERS
     minor_status        Mechanism specific status code.

     context_handle      Identifies the context on which the message arrived.

     message_buffer      Message to be verified.

     token_buffer        Token associated with message.

     qop_state           Quality of protection gained from MIC.  Specify NULL
                         if not required.

RETURN VALUES
     GSS_S_COMPLETE             Successful completion

     GSS_S_DEFECTIVE_TOKEN      The token failed consistency checks

     GSS_S_BAD_SIG              The MIC was incorrect

     GSS_S_DUPLICATE_TOKEN      The token was valid, and contained a correct
                                MIC for the message, but it had already been
                                processed

     GSS_S_OLD_TOKEN            The token was valid, and contained a correct
                                MIC for the message, but it is too old to
                                check for duplication

     GSS_S_UNSEQ_TOKEN          The token was valid, and contained a correct
                                MIC for the message, but has been verified out
                                of sequence; a later token has already been
                                received.

     GSS_S_GAP_TOKEN            The token was valid, and contained a correct
                                MIC for the message, but has been verified out
                                of sequence; an earlier expected token has not
                                yet been received

     GSS_S_CONTEXT_EXPIRED      The context has already expired

     GSS_S_NO_CONTEXT           The context_handle parameter did not identify
                                a valid context
