Catalyst::Plugin::LogWarnings(3)           User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Catalyst::Plugin::LogWarnings - Log perl warnings to your Catalyst log
       object

VERSION
       Version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
       In MyApp.pm:

           use Catalyst qw/LogWarnings/;

       After that, any "warn" statement that's executed during action
       processing is sent to the log "$c-"log> as a warning (instead of being
       dumped to STDERR).

       Example:

           package MyApp::Controller::Foo;
           sub foo : Local() { warn 'foobar!'; }
           1;

       Output (if you're using the standard Catalyst::Log logger):

           [info] MyApp running on Catalyst 5.7001
           [warn] foobar at Foo.pm line 2

CONFIGURATION
       None.

OVERRIDES
   execute
       Wraps "Catalyst::execute" and catches warnings with a $SIG{__WARN__}
       statement.

BUGS
       Warnings are caught after perl's rewritten them, so the line number and
       filename will be tacked on.

       Please report any bugs or feature requests to
       "bug-catalyst-plugin-logwarnings at rt.cpan.org", or through the web
       interface at

       progress on your bug as I make changes.
