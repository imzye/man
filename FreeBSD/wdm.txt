wdm(1x)                                                                wdm(1x)

NAME
       wdm - WINGs Display Manager

SYNOPSIS
       wdm [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       wdm is an X display manager based on the original X11 X Display Manager
       (xdm).  It features numerous functionality improvements, including the
       ability
        to reboot or halt the machine (once the proper password has been
       supplied) and to select from a list of available X sessions to start.
       The look of the login panel is somewhat configurable, too.

OPTIONS
       Except for -config, all of these options can be specified as resources.

       -config configuration_file
              Names the configuration file, which specifies resources to
              control the behavior of wdm. /usr/local/lib/X11/wdm/wdm-config
              is the default.

       -nodaemon
              Specifies ``false'' as the value for the
              DisplayManager.daemonMode resource. This suppresses the normal
              daemon behavior, which is for wdm to close all file descriptors,
              disassociate itself from the controlling terminal, and put
              itself in the background when it first starts up.

       -debug debug_level
              Specifies the numeric value for the DisplayManager.debugLevel
              resource.  A non-zero value causes wdm to print lots of
              debugging statements to the terminal; it also disables the
              DisplayManager.daemonMode resource, forcing wdm to run
              synchronously.  To interpret these debugging messages, a copy of
              the source code for wdm is almost a necessity.  No attempt has
              been made to rationalize or standardize the output.

       -error error_log_file
              Specifies the value for the DisplayManager.errorLogFile
              resource.  This file contains errors from wdm as well as
              anything written to stderr by the various scripts and programs
              run during the progress of the session.

       -syslog facility
              Specifies the value for the DisplayManager.syslogFacility
              resource. This is factility to use with all messages if log is
              redirected to syslog.

       -usesyslog
              Specifies ``true'' as the value for the
              DisplayManager.useSyslogP resource. This will force all messages
              go to syslog with facility specified by
              DisplayManager.syslogFacility resource.

       -useerrfile
              Specifies ``false'' as the value for the
              DisplayManager.useSyslogP resource. This will force all messages
              go to log file specified by DisplayManager.errorLogFile
              resource.

       -resources resource_file
              Specifies the value for the DisplayManager*resources resource.
              This file is loaded using xrdb to specify configuration
              parameters for the authentication widget.

       -server server_entry
              Specifies the value for the DisplayManager.servers resource.

       -udpPort port_number
              Specifies the value for the DisplayManager.requestPort resource.
              This sets the port-number which wdm will monitor for XDMCP
              requests.  As XDMCP uses the registered well-known UDP port 177,
              this resource should not be changed except for debugging. If set
              to 0 wdm will not listen for XDMCP or Chooser requests.

       -session session_program
              Specifies the value for the DisplayManager*session resource.
              This indicates the program to run as the session after the user
              has logged in.

       -xrm resource_specification
              Allows an arbitrary resource to be specified, as in most X
              Toolkit applications.

RESOURCES
       At many stages the actions of wdm can be controlled through the use of
       its configuration file, which is in the X resource format.  Some
       resources modify the behavior of wdm on all displays, while others
       modify its behavior on a single display.  Where actions relate to a
       specific display, the display name is inserted into the resource name
       between ``DisplayManager'' and the final resource name segment.

       For local displays, the resource name and class are as read from the
       Xservers file.

       For remote displays, the resource name is what the network address of
       the display resolves to.  See the removeDomain resource.  The name must
       match exactly; wdm is not aware of all the network aliases that might
       reach a given display.  If the name resolve fails, the address is used.
       The resource class is as sent by the display in the XDMCP Manage
       request.

       Because the resource manager uses colons to separate the name of the
       resource from its value and dots to separate resource name parts, wdm
       substitutes underscores for both dots and colons when generating the
       resource name.  For example, DisplayManager.expo_x_org_0.startup is the
       name of the resource which defines the startup shell file for the
       ``expo.x.org:0'' display.

       DisplayManager.servers
              This resource either specifies a file name full of server
              entries, one per line (if the value starts with a slash), or a
              single server entry.  See the section Local Server Specification
              for the details.

       DisplayManager.requestPort
              This indicates the UDP port number which wdm uses to listen for
              incoming XDMCP requests.  Unless you need to debug the system,
              leave this with its default value of 177.

       DisplayManager.errorLogFile
              Error output is normally directed at the system console.  To
              redirect it, set this resource to a file name.  A method to send
              these messages to syslog should be developed for systems which
              support it; however, the wide variety of interfaces precludes
              any system-independent implementation.  This file also contains
              any output directed to stderr by the Xsetup, Xstartup, Xsession
              and Xreset files, so it will contain descriptions of problems in
              those scripts as well.

       DisplayManager.debugLevel
              If the integer value of this resource is greater than zero,
              reams of debugging information will be printed.  It also
              disables daemon mode, which would redirect the information into
              the bit-bucket, and allows non-root users to run wdm, which
              would normally not be useful.

       DisplayManager.daemonMode
              Normally, wdm attempts to make itself into a daemon process
              unassociated with any terminal.  This is accomplished by forking
              and leaving the parent process to exit, then closing file
              descriptors and releasing the controlling terminal.  In some
              environments this is not desired (in particular, when
              debugging).  Setting this resource to ``false'' will disable
              this feature.

       DisplayManager.pidFile
              The filename specified will be created to contain an ASCII
              representation of the process-id of the main wdm process.  Xdm
              also uses file locking on this file to attempt to eliminate
              multiple daemons running on the same machine, which would cause
              quite a bit of havoc.

       DisplayManager.lockPidFile
              This is the resource which controls whether wdm uses file
              locking to keep multiple display managers from running amok.  On
              System V, this uses the lockf library call, while on BSD it uses
              flock.

       DisplayManager.authDir
              This names a directory under which wdm stores authorization
              files while initializing the session.  The default value is
              /usr/local/lib/X11/wdm. Can be overridden for specific displays
              by DisplayManager.DISPLAY.authFile.

       DisplayManager.autoRescan
              This boolean controls whether wdm rescans the configuration,
              servers, access control and authentication keys files after a
              session terminates and the files have changed.  By default it is
              ``true.''  You can force wdm to reread these files by sending a
              SIGHUP to the main process.

       DisplayManager.removeDomainname
              When computing the display name for XDMCP clients, the name
              resolver will typically create a fully qualified host name for
              the terminal.  As this is sometimes confusing, wdm will remove
              the domain name portion of the host name if it is the same as
              the domain name of the local host when this variable is set.  By
              default the value is ``true.''

       DisplayManager.keyFile
              XDM-AUTHENTICATION-1 style XDMCP authentication requires that a
              private key be shared between wdm and the terminal.  This
              resource specifies the file containing those values.  Each entry
              in the file consists of a display name and the shared key.  By
              default, wdm does not include support for XDM-AUTHENTICATION-1,
              as it requires DES which is not generally distributable because
              of United States export restrictions.

       DisplayManager.accessFile
              To prevent unauthorized XDMCP service and to allow forwarding of
              XDMCP IndirectQuery requests, this file contains a database of
              hostnames which are either allowed direct access to this
              machine, or have a list of hosts to which queries should be
              forwarded to.  The format of this file is described in the
              section XDMCP Access Control.

       DisplayManager.exportList
              A list of additional environment variables, separated by white
              space, to pass on to the Xsetup, Xstartup, Xsession, and Xreset
              programs.

       DisplayManager.randomFile
              A file to checksum to generate the seed of authorization keys.
              This should be a file that changes frequently.  The default is
              /dev/mem.

       DisplayManager.greeterLib
              On systems that support a dynamically-loadable greeter library,
              the name of the library.  The default is
              /usr/lib/X11/xdm/libXdmGreet.so.  This not used in Debian.

       DisplayManager.choiceTimeout
              Number of seconds to wait for display to respond after user has
              selected a host from the chooser.  If the display sends an XDMCP
              IndirectQuery within this time, the request is forwarded to the
              chosen host.  Otherwise, it is assumed to be from a new session
              and the chooser is offered again.  Default is 15.

       DisplayManager.sourceAddress
              Use the numeric IP address of the incoming connection on
              multihomed hosts instead of the host name. This is to avoid
              trying to connect on the wrong interface which might be down at
              this time.

       DisplayManager.willing
              This specifies a program which is run (as) root when an an XDMCP
              BroadcastQuery is received and this host is configured to offer
              XDMCP display management. The output of this program may be
              displayed on a chooser window.  If no program is specified, the
              string Willing to manage is sent.

       DisplayManager.DISPLAY.resources
              This resource specifies the name of the file to be loaded by
              xrdb as the resource database onto the root window of screen 0
              of the display.  The Xsetup program, the Login widget, and
              chooser will use the resources set in this file.  This resource
              data base is loaded just before the authentication procedure is
              started, so it can control the appearance of the login window.
              See the section Authentication Widget, which describes the
              various resources that are appropriate to place in this file.
              There is no default value for this resource, but
              /usr/local/lib/X11/wdm/Xresources is the conventional name.

       DisplayManager.DISPLAY.chooser
              Specifies the program run to offer a host menu for Indirect
              queries redirected to the special host name CHOOSER.
              /usr/X11R6/bin/chooser is the default.  See the sections XDMCP
              Access Control and Chooser.

       DisplayManager.DISPLAY.xrdb
              Specifies the program used to load the resources.  By default,
              wdm uses /usr/X11R6/bin/xrdb.

       DisplayManager.DISPLAY.cpp
              This specifies the name of the C preprocessor which is used by
              xrdb.

       DisplayManager.DISPLAY.setup
              This specifies a program which is run (as root) before offering
              the Login window.  This may be used to change the appearance of
              the screen around the Login window or to put up other windows
              (e.g., you may want to run xconsole here).  By default, no
              program is run.  The conventional name for a file used here is
              Xsetup.  See the section Setup Program.

       DisplayManager.DISPLAY.startup
              This specifies a program which is run (as root) after the
              authentication process succeeds.  By default, no program is run.
              The conventional name for a file used here is Xstartup.  See the
              section Startup Program.

       DisplayManager.DISPLAY.session
              This specifies the session to be executed (not running as root).
              By default, /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm is run.  The conventional name
              is Xsession.  See the section Session Program.

       DisplayManager.DISPLAY.reset
              This specifies a program which is run (as root) after the
              session terminates.  By default, no program is run.  The
              conventional name is Xreset.  See the section Reset Program.

       DisplayManager.DISPLAY.openDelay

       DisplayManager.DISPLAY.openRepeat

       DisplayManager.DISPLAY.openTimeout

       DisplayManager.DISPLAY.startAttempts
              These numeric resources control the behavior of wdm when
              attempting to open intransigent servers.  openDelay is the
              length of the pause (in seconds) between successive attempts,
              openRepeat is the number of attempts to make, openTimeout is the
              amount of time to wait while actually attempting the open (i.e.,
              the maximum time spent in the connect(2) system call) and
              startAttempts is the number of times this entire process is done
              before giving up on the server.  After openRepeat attempts have
              been made, or if openTimeout seconds elapse in any particular
              attempt, wdm terminates and restarts the server, attempting to
              connect again.  This process is repeated startAttempts times, at
              which point the display is declared dead and disabled.  Although
              this behavior may seem arbitrary, it has been empirically
              developed and works quite well on most systems.  The default
              values are 5 for openDelay, 5 for openRepeat, 30 for openTimeout
              and 4 for startAttempts.

       DisplayManager.DISPLAY.pingInterval

       DisplayManager.DISPLAY.pingTimeout
              To discover when remote displays disappear, wdm occasionally
              pings them, using an X connection and XSync calls.  pingInterval
              specifies the time (in minutes) between each ping attempt,
              pingTimeout specifies the maximum amount of time (in minutes) to
              wait for the terminal to respond to the request.  If the
              terminal does not respond, the session is declared dead and
              terminated.  By default, both are set to 5 minutes.  If you
              frequently use X terminals which can become isolated from the
              managing host, you may wish to increase this value.  The only
              worry is that sessions will continue to exist after the terminal
              has been accidentally disabled.  wdm will not ping local
              displays.  Although it would seem harmless, it is unpleasant
              when the workstation session is terminated as a result of the
              server hanging for NFS service and not responding to the ping.

       DisplayManager.DISPLAY.terminateServer
              This boolean resource specifies whether the X server should be
              terminated when a session terminates (instead of resetting it).
              This option can be used when the server tends to grow without
              bound over time, in order to limit the amount of time the server
              is run.  The default value is ``false.''

       DisplayManager.DISPLAY.userPath
              Xdm sets the PATH environment variable for the session to this
              value.  It should be a colon separated list of directories; see
              sh(1) for a full description.
              ``:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/ucb'' is a common setting.
              The default value can be specified at build time in the X system
              configuration file with DefaultUserPath.

       DisplayManager.DISPLAY.systemPath
              Xdm sets the PATH environment variable for the startup and reset
              scripts to the value of this resource.  The default for this
              resource is specified at build time by the DefaultSystemPath
              entry in the system configuration file;
              ``/etc:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/ucb'' is a common
              choice.  Note the absence of ``.'' from this entry.  This is a
              good practice to follow for root; it avoids many common Trojan
              Horse system penetration schemes.

       DisplayManager.DISPLAY.systemShell
              Xdm sets the SHELL environment variable for the startup and
              reset scripts to the value of this resource.  It is /bin/sh by
              default.

       DisplayManager.DISPLAY.failsafeClient
              If the default session fails to execute, wdm will fall back to
              this program.  This program is executed with no arguments, but
              executes using the same environment variables as the session
              would have had (see the section Session Program).  By default,
              /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm is used.

       DisplayManager.DISPLAY.grabServer

       DisplayManager.DISPLAY.grabTimeout
              To improve security, wdm grabs the server and keyboard while
              reading the login name and password.  The grabServer resource
              specifies if the server should be held for the duration of the
              name/password reading.  When ``false,'' the server is ungrabbed
              after the keyboard grab succeeds, otherwise the server is
              grabbed until just before the session begins.  The default is
              ``false.''  The grabTimeout resource specifies the maximum time
              wdm will wait for the grab to succeed.  The grab may fail if
              some other client has the server grabbed, or possibly if the
              network latencies are very high.  This resource has a default
              value of 3 seconds; you should be cautious when raising it, as a
              user can be spoofed by a look-alike window on the display.  If
              the grab fails, wdm kills and restarts the server (if possible)
              and the session.

       DisplayManager.DISPLAY.authorize

       DisplayManager.DISPLAY.authName
              authorize is a boolean resource which controls whether wdm
              generates and uses authorization for the local server
              connections.  If authorization is used, authName is a list of
              authorization mechanisms to use, separated by white space.
              XDMCP connections dynamically specify which authorization
              mechanisms are supported, so authName is ignored in this case.
              When authorize is set for a display and authorization is not
              available, the user is informed by having a different message
              displayed in the login widget.  By default, authorize is
              ``true.''  authName is ``MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1,'' or, if XDM-
              AUTHORIZATION-1 is available, ``XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 MIT-MAGIC-
              COOKIE-1.''

       DisplayManager.DISPLAY.authFile
              This file is used to communicate the authorization data from wdm
              to the server, using the -auth server command line option.  It
              should be kept in a directory which is not world-writable as it
              could easily be removed, disabling the authorization mechanism
              in the server.  If not specified, a name is generated from
              DisplayManager.authDir and the name of the display.

       DisplayManager.DISPLAY.authComplain
              If set to ``false,'' disables the use of the unsecureGreeting in
              the login window.  See the section Authentication Widget. The
              default is ``true.''

       DisplayManager.DISPLAY.resetSignal
              The number of the signal wdm sends to reset the server.  See the
              section Controlling the Server. The default is 1 (SIGHUP).

       DisplayManager.DISPLAY.termSignal
              The number of the signal wdm sends to terminate the server.  See
              the section Controlling the Server. The default is 15 (SIGTERM).

       DisplayManager.DISPLAY.resetForAuth
              The original implementation of authorization in the sample
              server reread the authorization file at server reset time,
              instead of when checking the initial connection.  As wdm
              generates the authorization information just before connecting
              to the display, an old server would not get up-to-date
              authorization information.  This resource causes wdm to send
              SIGHUP to the server after setting up the file, causing an
              additional server reset to occur, during which time the new
              authorization information will be read.  The default is
              ``false,'' which will work for all MIT servers.

       DisplayManager.DISPLAY.userAuthDir
              When wdm is unable to write to the usual user authorization file
              ($HOME/.Xauthority), it creates a unique file name in this
              directory and points the environment variable XAUTHORITY at the
              created file.  It uses /tmp by default.

       DisplayManager.wdmLogin
              Specifies the path to wdmLogin(1x)

       DisplayManager.wdmWm
              Is a colon separated list of window managers to use as options
              in the login panel. Note that if you include the path to the
              window manager, it will look ugly. You may set this resource to
              None if you want only NoChange to appear.

       DisplayManager.wdmLogo
              Path to the logo pixmap, several formats are accepted, read
              wdmLogin(1x) to find out more.

       DisplayManager.wdmHelpFile
              Path to a text file which will be displayed in the help panel,
              read wdmLogin(1x) to find out more.

       DisplayManager.wdmDefaultUser
              a default username which will be used if no username is typed.

       DisplayManager.wdmDefaultPasswd
              the clear text password of the default user above. BE VERY
              CAREFUL when using this two resources, and don't forget to do:
              chmod 600 wdm-config ; chown root.root wdm-config

       DisplayManager.wdmBg
              Background specification. Read the BACKGROUND IMAGE
              SPECIFICATION section to find out about the format.  If this is
              not specified, then the background is not set.

       DisplayManager.wdmReboot
              Reboot command.

       DisplayManager.wdmHalt
              Halt command.

       DisplayManager.wdmVerify
              If true, verify user's identity for reboot/halt/exit.

       DisplayManager.wdmRoot
              If true, user must be root to exit.

       DisplayManager.wdmAnimations
              If true, enable animations consisting of shaking the panel (if
              an error) and rolling up the panel (when closing it).  If false,
              animations are disabled.

       DisplayManager.wdmLocale
              LANG environment variable will be set to value of this resource
              before starting wdmLogin.

       DisplayManger.wdmCursorTheme
              If you have recent version of XFree with support for transparent
              cursors you can select cursor theme to use on login panel.
              XCURSOR_THEME environment variable will be set to value of this
              resource before starting wdmLogin.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       The default location of the wdm configuration file is
       /usr/local/lib/X11/wdm/wdm-config

       Here is a reasonable configuration file, which could be named wdm-
       config:


            DisplayManager.servers:            /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers
            DisplayManager.errorLogFile:       /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-errors
            DisplayManager*resources:          /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources
            DisplayManager*startup:            /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/Xstartup
            DisplayManager*session:            /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession
            DisplayManager.pidFile:            /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-pid
            DisplayManager._0.authorize:       true
            DisplayManager*authorize:          false


       Note that this file mostly contains references to other files.  Note
       also that some of the resources are specified with ``*'' separating the
       components.  These resources can be made unique for each different
       display, by replacing the ``*'' with the display-name, but normally
       this is not very useful.  See the Resources section for a complete
       discussion.  If the entry is a host name, all comparisons are done
       using network addresses, so any name which converts to the correct
       network address may be used.  For patterns, only canonical host names
       are used in the comparison, so ensure that you do not attempt to match
       aliases.  Preceding either a host name or a pattern with a `!'
       character causes hosts which match that entry to be excluded.

       To only respond to Direct queries for a host or pattern, it can be
       followed by the optional ``NOBROADCAST'' keyword.  This can be used to
       prevent an wdm server from appearing on menus based on Broadcast
       queries.

       An Indirect entry also contains a host name or pattern, but follows it
       with a list of host names or macros to which indirect queries should be
       sent.

       A macro definition contains a macro name and a list of host names and
       other macros that the macro expands to.  To distinguish macros from
       hostnames, macro names start with a `%' character.  Macros may be
       nested.

       Indirect entries may also specify to have wdm run chooser to offer a
       menu of hosts to connect to.  See the section Chooser.

       When checking access for a particular display host, each entry is
       scanned in turn and the first matching entry determines the response.
       Direct and Broadcast entries are ignored when scanning for an Indirect
       entry and vice-versa.

       Blank lines are ignored, `#' is treated as a comment delimiter causing
       the rest of that line to be ignored, and `\newline' causes the newline
       to be ignored, allowing indirect host lists to span multiple lines.

       Here is an example Xaccess file:

       #
       # Xaccess - XDMCP access control file
       #

       #
       # Direct/Broadcast query entries
       #

       !xtra.lcs.mit.edu   # disallow direct/broadcast service for xtra
       bambi.ogi.edu       # allow access from this particular display
       *.lcs.mit.edu       # allow access from any display in LCS

       *.deshaw.com        NOBROADCAST         # allow only direct access
       *.gw.com                                # allow direct and broadcast

       #
       # Indirect query entries
       #

       %HOSTS              expo.lcs.mit.edu xenon.lcs.mit.edu \
                           excess.lcs.mit.edu kanga.lcs.mit.edu

       extract.lcs.mit.edu xenon.lcs.mit.edu   #force extract to contact xenon
       !xtra.lcs.mit.edu   dummy               #disallow indirect access
       *.lcs.mit.edu       %HOSTS              #all others get to choose

RESOURCES FILE
       The Xresources file is loaded onto the display as a resource database
       using xrdb.  As the authentication widget reads this database before
       starting up, it usually contains parameters for that widget:

            xlogin*login.translations: #override\
                 Ctrl<Key>R: abort-display()\n\
                 <Key>F1: set-session-argument(failsafe) finish-field()\n\
                 <Key>Return: set-session-argument() finish-field()
            xlogin*borderWidth: 3
            xlogin*greeting: CLIENTHOST
            #ifdef COLOR
            xlogin*greetColor: CadetBlue
            xlogin*failColor: red
            #endif


       Please note the translations entry; it specifies a few new translations
       for the widget which allow users to escape from the default session
       (and avoid troubles that may occur in it).  Note that if #override is
       not specified, the default translations are removed and replaced by the
       new value, not a very useful result as some of the default translations
       are quite useful (such as ``<Key>: insert-char ()'' which responds to
       normal typing).

       This file may also contain resources for the setup program and chooser.

SETUP PROGRAM
       The Xsetup file is run after the server is reset, but before the Login
       window is offered.  The file is typically a shell script.  It is run as
       root, so should be careful about security.  This is the place to change
       the root background or bring up other windows that should appear on the
       screen along with the Login widget.

       In addition to any specified by DisplayManager.exportList, the
       following environment variables are passed:

            DISPLAY        the associated display name
            PATH           the value of DisplayManager.DISPLAY.systemPath
            SHELL          the value of DisplayManager.DISPLAY.systemShell
            XAUTHORITY     may be set to an authority file

       Note that since wdm grabs the keyboard, any other windows will not be
       able to receive keyboard input.  They will be able to interact with the
       mouse, however; beware of potential security holes here.  If
       DisplayManager.DISPLAY.grabServer is set, Xsetup will not be able to
       connect to the display at all.  Resources for this program can be put
       into the file named by DisplayManager.DISPLAY.resources.

       Here is a sample Xsetup script:

            #!/bin/sh
            # Xsetup_0 - setup script for one workstation
            xcmsdb < /usr/X11R6/lib/monitors/alex.0
            xconsole -geometry 480x130-0-0 -notify -verbose -exitOnFail &


BACKGROUND IMAGE SPECIFICATION
       There are several possible ways of specifing a background image. The
       generic format is type:image. type can be any of:

       none   The backgound is not set.

       solid  it renders a solid backgroud, and image is a color name

       hgradient, vgradient, dgradient
              a gradient (either horizontal, vertical or diagonal) will be
              rendered. image is comma separated of color names, and any
              number of colors can be specified.

       pixmap a pixmap will be used for the background. image is the full path
              to an image file (tiff, png, jpeg and xpm allowed) and it will
              be scaled to use the full screen.
