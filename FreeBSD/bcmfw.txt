BCMFW(8)                FreeBSD System Manager's Manual               BCMFW(8)

NAME
     bcmfw – firmware download utility for Broadcom BCM2033 chip based
     Bluetooth USB devices

SYNOPSIS
     bcmfw [-h] -f firmware_file_name -m mini-driver_file_name -n device_name

DESCRIPTION
     The bcmfw utility downloads the specified mini-driver and firmware files
     to the specified device.

     This utility will only work with Broadcom BCM2033 chip based Bluetooth
     USB devices.  The identification is currently based on USB vendor
     ID/product ID pair.  The vendor ID should be 0x0a5c (USB_VENDOR_BROADCOM)
     and the product ID should be 0x2033.

     Due to copyright issues I will no longer provide mini-driver and firmware
     files for the device.  These files can be obtained from the Linux BlueZ
     bluez-firmware package.

     Visit http://www.bluez.org/download.html for details.

     I am using the following files from the bluez-firmware-1.0 package:

           MD5 (BCM2033-MD.hex) = 5580317158d07fc4ace90af04f8e1c73
           MD5 (BCM2033-FW.bin) = b4e142b3272cfe5a84b32fda6b4b032f

     The options are as follows:

     -f firmware_file_name
             Specify firmware file name for download.

     -h      Display usage message and exit.

     -m mini-driver_file_name
             Specify mini-driver file name for download.

     -n device_name
             Specify device name.

FILES
     BCM2033-MD.hex                              Mini-driver image.
     BCM2033-FW.bin                              Firmware image.
     /dev/ubtbcmfwN.EE                           Endpoint EE of device N.

EXIT STATUS
     The bcmfw utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     To download the firmware into the /dev/ubtbcmfw0 device:

           bcmfw -n ubtbcmfw0 -m BCM2033-MD.hex -f BCM2033-FW.bin
