        Available Hashes

       CRC32: The crc32 algorithm is used to compute checksums. The two
       variants used in mhash are: MHASH_CRC32 (like the one used in ethernet)
       and MHASH_CRC32B (like the one used in ZIP programs).

       ADLER32: The adler32 algorithm is used to compute checksums. It is
       faster than CRC32 and it is considered to be as reliable as CRC32. This
       algorithm is defined as MHASH_ADLER32.

       MD5: The MD5 algorithm by Ron Rivest and RSA. In mhash this algorithm
       is defined as MHASH_MD5.

       MD4: The MD4 algorithm by Ron Rivest and RSA. This algorithm is
       considered broken, so don't use it. In mhash this algorithm is defined
       as MHASH_MD4.

       SHA1/SHA256: The SHA algorithm by US. NIST/NSA. This algorithm is
       specified for use in the NIST's Digital Signature Standard. In mhash
       these algorithm are defined as MHASH_SHA1 and MHASH_SHA256.

       HAVAL: HAVAL is a one-way hashing algorithm with variable length of
       output.  HAVAL is a modification of MD5.  Defined in mhash as:
       MHASH_HAVAL256, MHASH_HAVAL192, MHASH_HAVAL160, MHASH_HAVAL128.

       RIPEMD160: RIPEMD-160 is a 160-bit cryptographic hash function,
       designed by Hans Dobbertin, Antoon Bosselaers, and Bart Preneel. It is
       intended to be used as a secure replacement for the 128-bit hash
       functions MD4, MD5, and RIPEMD. MD4 and MD5 were developed by Ron
       Rivest for RSA Data Security, while RIPEMD was developed in the
       framework of the EU project RIPE (RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation,
       1988-1992).  In mhash this algorithm is defined as MHASH_RIPEMD160.

       TIGER: Tiger is a fast hash function, by Eli Biham and Ross Anderson.
       Tiger was designed to be very fast on modern computers, and in
       particular on the state-of-the-art 64-bit computers, while it is still
       not slower than other suggested hash functions on 32-bit machines.  In
       mhash this algorithm is defined as: MHASH_TIGER, MHASH_TIGER160,
       MHASH_TIGER128.

       GOST: GOST algorithm is a russian standard and it uses the GOST
       encryption algorithm to produce a 256 bit hash value. This algorithm is
       specified for use in the Russian Digital Signature Standard.  In mhash
       this algorithm is defined as MHASH_GOST.

        Available Key Generation algorithms

       KEYGEN_MCRYPT: The key generator used in mcrypt.

       KEYGEN_ASIS: Just returns the password as binary key.

       KEYGEN_HEX: Just converts a hex key into a binary one.

       KEYGEN_PKDES: The transformation used in Phil Karn's DES encryption
       program.

       KEYGEN_S2K_SIMPLE: The OpenPGP (rfc2440) Simple S2K.

       KEYGEN_S2K_SALTED: The OpenPGP Salted S2K.

       KEYGEN_S2K_ISALTED: The OpenPGP Iterated Salted S2K.

DESCRIPTION
       The mhash library provides an easy to use C interface for several hash
       algorithms (also known as "one-way" algorithms). These can be used to
       create checksums, message digests and more. Currently, MD5, SHA1, GOST,
       TIGER, RIPE-MD160, HAVAL and several other algorithms are supported.
       mhash support HMAC generation (a mechanism for message authentication
       using cryptographic hash functions, and is described in rfc2104). HMAC
       can be used to create message digests using a secret key, so that these
       message digests cannot be regenerated (or replaced) by someone else.  A
       key generation mechanism was added to mhash since key generation
       algorithms usually involve hash algorithms.

API FUNCTIONS
       We will describe the API of mhash in detail now. The order follows the
       one in the SYNOPSIS directly.

       size_t mhash_count(void);
           This returns the "hashid" of the last available hash. Hashes are
           numbered from 0 to "mhash_count()".

       size_t mhash_get_block_size(hashid type);
           If type exists, this returns the used blocksize of the hash type in
           bytes. Otherwise, it returns 0.

       char *mhash_get_hash_name(hashid type);
           If type exists, this returns the name of the hash type. Otherwise,
           a "NULL" pointer is returned. The string is allocated with
           malloc(3) seperately, so do not forget to free(3) it.

       const char *mhash_get_hash_name_static(hashid type);
           If type exists, this returns the name of the hash type. Otherwise,
           a "NULL" pointer is returned.

       size_t mhash_get_hash_pblock(hashid type);
           It returns the block size that the algorithm operates. This is used
           in mhash_hmac_init. If the return value is 0 you shouldn't use that
           algorithm in HMAC.

       hashid mhash_get_mhash_algo(MHASH src);
           Returns the algorithm used in the state of src.

       MHASH mhash_init(hashid type);
           This setups a context to begin hashing using the algorithm type. It
           returns a descriptor to that context which will result in leaking
           memory, if you do not call mhash_deinit(3) later. Returns
           "MHASH_FAILED" on failure.

       MHASH mhash_hmac_init(const hashid type, void *key, int keysize, int
       block);
           This setups a context to begin hashing using the algorithm type in
           HMAC mode.  key should be a pointer to the key and keysize its len.
           The block is the block size (in bytes) that the algorithm operates.
           It should be obtained by mhash_get_hash_pblock(). If its 0 it
           defaults to 64.  After calling it you should use mhash() to update
           the context.  It returns a descriptor to that context which will
           result in leaking memory, if you do not call mhash_hmac_deinit(3)
           later.  Returns "MHASH_FAILED" on failure.

       MHASH mhash_cp(MHASH src);
           This setups a new context using the state of src.

       int mhash(MHASH thread, const void *plaintext, size_t size);
           This updates the context described by thread with plaintext. size
           is the length of plaintext which may be binary data.

       int mhash_save_state_mem( MHASH thread, void *mem, int* mem_size);
           Saves the state of a hashing algorithm such that it can be restored
           at some later point in time using mhash_restore_state_mem().
           mem_size should contain the size of the given mem pointer. If it is
           not enough to hold the buffer the required value will be copied
           there.

       MHASH mhash_restore_state_mem(void* mem);
           Restores the state of a hashing algorithm that was saved using
           mhash_save_state_mem(). Use like mhash_init().

       void *mhash_end(MHASH thread);
           This frees all resources associated with thread and returns the
           result of the whole hashing operation (the ``digest'').

       void mhash_deinit(MHASH thread, void* digest);
           This frees all resources associated with thread and stores the
           result of the whole hashing operation in memory pointed by digest.
           digest may be null.

       void *mhash_hmac_end(MHASH thread);
           This frees all resources associated with thread and returns the
           result of the whole hashing operation (the ``mac'').

       int mhash_hmac_deinit(MHASH thread, void* digest);
           This frees all resources associated with thread and stores the
           result of the whole hashing operation in memory pointed by digest.
           Digest may be null. Returns non-zero in case of an error.

       void *mhash_end_m(MHASH thread, void* (*hash_malloc)(size_t));
           This frees all resources associated with thread and returns the
           result of the whole hashing operation (the ``digest''). The result
           will be allocated by using the hash_malloc() function provided.

       void *mhash_hmac_end(MHASH thread, void* (*hash_malloc)(size_t));
           This frees all resources associated with thread and returns the
           result of the whole hashing operation (the ``mac''). The result
           will be allocated by using the hash_malloc() function provided.

KEYGEN API FUNCTIONS
       We will now describe the Key Generation API of mhash in detail.

       int mhash_keygen_ext(keygenid algorithm, KEYGEN algorithm_data, void*
       keyword, int keysize, unsigned char* password, int passwordlen);
           This function, generates a key from a password. The password is
           read from password and it's len should be in passwordlen.  The key
           generation algorithm is specified in algorithm, and that algorithm
           may (internally) use the KEYGEN structure. The KEYGEN structure
           consists of:
            typedef struct keygen {
                   hashid          hash_algorithm[2];
                   unsigned int    count;
                   void*           salt;
                   int             salt_size;
            } KEYGEN;

           The algorithm(s) specified in algorithm_data.hash_algorithm, should
           be hash algorithms and may be used by the key generation algorithm.
           Some key generation algorithms may use more than one hash
           algorithms (view also mhash_keygen_uses_hash_algorithm()).  If it
           is desirable (and supported by the algorithm, eg.
           KEYGEN_S2K_SALTED) a salt may be specified in algorithm_data.salt
           of size algorithm_data.salt_size or may be NULL.

           The algorithm may use the algorithm_data.count internally (eg.
           KEYGEN_S2K_ISALTED).  The generated keyword is stored in keyword,
           which should be (at least) keysize bytes long.  The generated
           keyword is a binary one. Returns a negative number on failure.

       int mhash_keygen_uses_salt( keygenid algorithm);
           This function returns 1 if the specified key generation algorithm
           needs a salt to be specified.

       int mhash_keygen_uses_count( keygenid algorithm);
           This function returns 1 if the specified key generation algorithm
           needs the algorithm_data.count field in mhash_keygen_ext(). The
           count field tells the algorithm to hash repeatedly the password and
           to stop when count bytes have been processed.

       int mhash_get_keygen_salt_size( keygenid algorithm);
           This function returns the size of the salt size, that the specific
           algorithm will use. If it returns 0, then there is no limitation in
           the size.

       int mhash_get_keygen_max_key_size( keygenid algorithm);
           This function returns the maximum size of the key, that the key
           generation algorithm may produce.  If it returns 0, then there is
           no limitation in the size.

       int mhash_keygen_uses_hash_algorithm( keygenid algorithm);
           This function returns the number of the hash algorithms the key
           generation algorithm will use. If it is 0 then no hash algorithm is
           used by the key generation algorithm. This is for the
           algorithm_data.hash_algorithm field in mhash_keygen_ext(). If

       size_t mhash_keygen_count(void);
           This returns the "keygenid" of the last available key generation
           algorithm.  Algorithms are numbered from 0 to
           "mhash_keygen_count()".

       char *mhash_get_keygen_name(keygenid type);
           If type exists, this returns the name of the keygen type.
           Otherwise, a "NULL" pointer is returned. The string is allocated
           with malloc(3) seperately, so do not forget to free(3) it.

       const char *mhash_get_keygen_name_static(keygenid type);
           If type exists, this returns the name of the keygen type.
           Otherwise, a "NULL" pointer is returned.

EXAMPLE

        #include <mhash.h>
        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <stdlib.h>

        int main(void)
        {
               int i;
               MHASH td;
               unsigned char buffer;
               unsigned char hash[16]; /* enough size for MD5 */

               td = mhash_init(MHASH_MD5);

               if (td == MHASH_FAILED) exit(1);

               while (fread(&buffer, 1, 1, stdin) == 1) {
                       mhash(td, &buffer, 1);
               }

               mhash_deinit(td, hash);

               printf("Hash:");
               for (i = 0; i < mhash_get_block_size(MHASH_MD5); i++) {
                       printf("%.2x", hash[i]);
               }
               printf("\n");

               exit(0);
        }

        {

               char password[] = "Jefe";

               int j;

               td = mhash_hmac_init(MHASH_MD5, password, keylen,
                                   mhash_get_hash_pblock(MHASH_MD5));

               mhash(td, data, datalen);
               mhash_hmac_deinit(td, mac);

        /*
