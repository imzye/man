FDCONTROL(8)            FreeBSD System Manager's Manual           FDCONTROL(8)

NAME
     fdcontrol – display and modify floppy disk parameters

SYNOPSIS
     fdcontrol [-F] [-d dbg] [-f fmt] [-s fmtstr] [-v] device

DESCRIPTION
     The fdcontrol utility allows the modification of the run-time behavior of
     the fdc(4) driver for the device specified by device.

     Commands are implemented to query the current device density settings as
     well as the underlying device hardware as registered with the driver, to
     manipulate debugging levels, and to adjust the device density settings.
     All the operations that manipulate the kernel settings are restricted to
     the superuser (by the device driver), while all inquiry requests only
     require read access to device.

     The device argument should always be given as a full path name, e.g.
     /dev/fd0.

   Inquiry Commands
     Running the fdcontrol utility without any of the optional flags will
     report the drive type that is registered with the device driver.  In the
     shortest form, a single string describing the drive type will be
     returned.  Possible values are: “360K”, “1.2M”, “720K”, “1.44M”, “2.88M”,
     or “unknown”.  This information is primarily intended to be easily
     parsable by scripts.

     In order to add some descriptive text that makes the output better human
     readable, the flag -v can be added.

     Specifying flag -F will report the device's density settings in a form
     that is suitable as input to the -s fmtstr option (see below).  Again,
     together with -v, some more text will be returned, including the total
     capacity of the density settings in kilobytes.

   Debug Control
     The fdc(4) control utilities support two different options how to specify
     device density settings.  The first form uses -f fmt to specify the
     format of the medium in kilobytes.  Depending on the underlying drive
     type, the value is compared against a table of known commonly used device
     density settings for that drive, and if a match is found, those settings
     will be used.  Currently, the following values for the respective drive
     types are acceptable:

     2.88M and 1.44M drives:

     The second form to specify a device density uses -s fmtstr to explicitly
     specify each parameter in detail.  The argument fmtstr is a comma-
     separated list of values of the form:

     sectrac,secsize,datalen,gap,ncyls,speed,heads,f_gap,f_inter,offs2,flags

     The meaning of the parameters is:

     sectrac      The number of sectors per track.

     secsize      The sector size code, 0 = 128 bytes (or less), 1 = 256
                  bytes, 2 = 512 bytes, 3 = 1024 bytes.

     datalen      The actual sector size if the size code is 0, or the
                  (ignored) value 0xFF for larger size codes.

     gap          The length of the gap 3 parameter for read/write operations.

     ncyls        The number of cylinders.

     speed        The transfer speed in kilobytes per second.  Can be 250,
                  300, 500, or 1000, but each drive type only supports a
                  subset of these values.

     heads        The number of heads.

     f_gap        The length of the gap 3 when formatting media.

     f_inter      The sector interleave to be applied when formatting.  0
                  means no interleave, 1 means 1:1 etc.

     offs2        The offset of the sector numbers on side 2 (i.e., head
                  number 1).  Normally, sector numbering on both sides starts
                  with 1.

     flags        A list from one of the following flag values:

                  +mfm          Use MFM encoding.
                  -mfm          Use FM (single-density) encoding.
                  +2step        Use 2 steps per each cylinder (for accessing
                                40-cylinder media in 80-cylinder drives).
                  -2step        Do not use 2 steps per cylinder, i.e., access
                                each physical cylinder of the drive.
                  +perpend      Use perpendicular recording (for 2.88 MB
                                media, currently not supported).
                  -perpend      Use longitudinal recording.

     For any missing parameter, the current value will be used, so only actual
     changes need to be specified.  Thus to turn off a flag bit (like +mfm
     which is the default for all drive types), the form with a leading minus
     sign must explicitly be used.

EXAMPLES
     A simple inquiry about the drive type:

           $ fdcontrol /dev/fd0
           1.44M

     Same as above, but with verbose output.  Note that the result is about
     the drive type, as opposed to a device density, so it is independent from
     the actual subdevice being used for device.

           $ fdcontrol -v /dev/fd0
           /dev/fd0: 1.44M drive (3.5" high-density)

     Inquiry about the density settings:

           $ fdcontrol -F /dev/fd0
           18,512,0xff,0x1b,80,500,2,0x6c,1,0,+mfm

     The verbose flag makes this human readable:

           /dev/fd0: 1440 KB media type
                   Format:         18,512,0xff,0x1b,80,500,2,0x6c,1,0,+mfm
                   Sector size:    512
                   Sectors/track:  18
                   Heads/cylinder: 2
                   Cylinders/disk: 80
                   Transfer rate:  500 kbps
                   Sector gap:     27
                   Format gap:     108
                   Interleave:     1
                   Side offset:    0
                   Flags           <MFM>

     As indicated, trailing commas in the parameter list may be omitted.

     In order to access archaic 160 KB single-density (FM encoded) 5.25 media
     in a modern 1.2M drive, something like the following definition would be
     needed.  (Note that not all controller hardware is actually capable of
     handling FM encoding at all.)

     # fdcontrol -s 16,128,0x80,0x2,40,300,,0x10,,,-mfm,+2step /dev/fd1.1

     It is still possible to hook up 8" drives to most modern floppy
     controllers, given the right cable magic.  (On PC hardware, tell the BIOS
     that it is a 5.25" drive.)  The classical 128/26/2/77 format can be read
     with this entry

           fdcontrol -s  26,128,0x80,0x2,77,500,2,0x10,,,-mfm /dev/fd0
