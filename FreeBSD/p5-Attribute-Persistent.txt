NAME
       Attribute::Persistent - Really lazy persistence

SYNOPSIS
           use Attribute::Persistent;

           my %hash :persistent;
           $hash{counter}++; # Value retained between calls to the program.

           my %hash2 :persistent(SessionTable); # Explicitly provide a filename.

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a way of abstracting away persistence of array and
       hash variables.

       It's useful for quick hacks when you don't care about pulling in the
       right DBM library and calling "tie" and so on. Its job is to reduce
       fuss for the lazy programmer at the cost of flexibility.

       It uses "MLDBM", so you can use complex data structures in your arrays
       and hashes. It uses "AnyDBM_File", so if you really care about which
       DBM you get, you can modify "AnyDBM_File::ISA" in a "BEGIN" block after
       loading this module.

       It works out which DBMs belong to it by taking an md5 sum of the source
       code. This means that if you change your code, you lose your data.  If
       you like to keep your data while messing about with your code, you need
       to explicitly give "Attribute::Persistent" a key, like this:

           BEGIN { $Attribute::Persistent::KEY = "MyProgram"; }
           use Attribute::Persistent; # Order is important.

       This uniquely identifies your program, meaning that the module doesn't
       have to grub around with $0 and md5 sums.

       But hell, it's not supposed to be this complex. Just use the module and
       slap ":persistent" onto your lexicals where appropriate, and it just
       works. That's all most people need to care about.
