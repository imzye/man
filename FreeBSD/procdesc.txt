PROCDESC(4)            FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual            PROCDESC(4)

NAME
     procdesc – process descriptor facility

DESCRIPTION
     procdesc is a file-descriptor-oriented interface to process signalling
     and control, which supplements historic UNIX fork(2) and kill(2),
     primitives with new system calls such as pdfork(2) and pdkill(2),
     procdesc is designed for use with capsicum(4), replacing process
     identifiers with capability-oriented references.  However, it can also be
     used independently of capsicum(4), displacing PIDs, which may otherwise
     suffer from race conditions.  Given a process descriptor, it is possible
     to query its conventional PID using pdgetpid(2).
