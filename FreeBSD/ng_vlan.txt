NG_VLAN(4)             FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual             NG_VLAN(4)

NAME
     ng_vlan – IEEE 802.1Q VLAN tagging netgraph node type

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <netgraph.h>
     #include <netgraph/ng_vlan.h>

DESCRIPTION
     The vlan node type multiplexes frames tagged according to the IEEE 802.1Q
     standard between different hooks.

     Each node has two special hooks, downstream and nomatch, and an arbitrary
     number of “vlan” hooks, each associated with a particular VLAN tag.

     An ETHERTYPE_VLAN frame received on the downstream hook with a tag that
     the node has been configured to filter is sent out the corresponding
     “vlan” hook.  If it does not match any of the configured tags, or is not
     of a type ETHERTYPE_VLAN, it is sent out the nomatch hook.  If the
     nomatch hook is not connected, the packet is dropped.

     An Ethernet frame received on the nomatch hook is passed unmodified to
     the downstream hook.

     An Ethernet frame received on any of the “vlan” hooks is tagged
     accordingly and sent out the downstream hook.

HOOKS
     This node type supports the following hooks:

     downstream            Typically this hook would be connected to a
                           ng_ether(4) node, using the lower hook.

     nomatch               Typically this hook would also be connected to an
                           ng_ether(4) type node using the upper hook.

     ⟨any valid name⟩      Any other hook name will be accepted and should
                           later be associated with a particular tag.
                           Typically this hook would be attached to an
                           ng_eiface(4) type node using the ether hook.

CONTROL MESSAGES
     This node type supports the generic control messages, plus the following:

     NGM_VLAN_ADD_FILTER (addfilter)
          Associates a hook with the tag.

     NGM_VLAN_DEL_FILTER (delfilter)
          Disassociates a hook from the tag.

     NGM_VLAN_GET_TABLE (gettable)
          Returns a table of all hook/tag associations.

EXAMPLES
     #!/bin/sh

     ETHER_IF=rl0

     ngctl -f- <<EOF
     shutdown ${ETHER_IF}:
     mkpeer ${ETHER_IF}: vlan lower downstream
     name ${ETHER_IF}:lower vlan
     connect ${ETHER_IF}: vlan: upper nomatch
     EOF

     ngctl mkpeer vlan: eiface vlan123 ether
     ngctl msg vlan: addfilter '{ vlan=123 hook="vlan123" }'

SHUTDOWN
     This node shuts down upon receipt of a NGM_SHUTDOWN control message, or
     when all hooks have been disconnected.
