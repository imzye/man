SYNOPSIS
         use Net::Google::PicasaWeb;

         my $service = Net::Google::PicasaWeb->new;

         # Login via one of these
         $service->login('jondoe@gmail.com', 'north23AZ');

         # Working with albums (see Net::Google::PicasaWeb::Album)
         my @albums = $service->list_albums( user_id => 'jondoe');
         $album->title('Quick Trip To Italy');

         # Listing photos (see Net::Google::PicasaWeb::MediaEntry)
         my @photos      = $album->list_media_entries;
         my @recent      = $album->list_media_entries( max_results => 10 );
         my @puppies     = $album->list_media_entries( q => 'puppies' );
         my @all_puppies = $service->list_media_entries( q => 'puppies' );

ATTRIBUTES
       This module uses Moose to handle attributes and such. These attributes
       are readable, writable, and may be passed to the constructor unless
       otherwise noted.

   authenticator
       This is an Net::Google::AuthSub object used to handle authentication.
       The default is an instance set to use a service of "lh2" and a source
       of "Net::Google::PicasaWeb-VERSION".

   user_agent
       This is an LWP::UserAgent object used to handle web communication.

   service_base_url
       This is the base URL of the API to contact. This should probably always
       be "http://picasaweb.google.com/data/feed/api/" unless Google starts
       providing alternate URLs or someone has a service providing the same
       API elsewhere..

   xml_namespaces
       When parsing the Google Data API response, these are the namespaces
       that will be used. By default, this is defined as:

           {
               'http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/'         => 'media',
               'http://schemas.google.com/photos/2007' => 'gphoto',
               'http://www.georss.org/georss'          => 'georss',
               'http://www.opengis.net/gml'            => 'gml',
           }

       You may add more namespaces to this list, if needed.

METHODS
   new
         my $service = Net::Google::PicasaWeb->new(%params);

       See the "ATTRIBUTES" section for a list of possible parameters.

   login
         my $success = $service->login($username, $password, %options);

       This is a shortcut for performing:

         $service->authenticator->login($username, $password, %options);

       It has some additional error handling. This method will return a true
       value on success or die on error.

       See Net::Google::AuthSub.

   list_albums
         my @albums = $service->list_albums(%params);

       This will list a set of albums available from Picasa Web Albums. If no
       %params are set, then this will list the albums belonging to the
       authenticated user. If the user is not authenticated, this will
       probably not return anything. Further control is gained by specifying
       one or more of the following parameters:

       user_id
           This is the user ID to request a list of albums from. The defaults
           to "default", which lists those belonging to the current
           authenticated user.

       This method also takes the "STANDARD LIST OPTIONS".

   get_album
         my $album = $service->get_album(
             user_id  => 'hanenkamp',
             album_id => '5143195220258642177',
         );

       This will fetch a single album from the Picasa Web Albums using the
       given "user_id" and "album_id". If "user_id" is omitted, then "default"
       will be used instead.

       This method returns "undef" if no such album exists.

   list_tags
       Returns a list of tags that have been used by the logged user or the
       user named in the "user_id" parameter.

       This method accepts this parameters:

       user_id
           The ID of the user to find tags for. Defaults to the current user.

       This method also takes all the "STANDARD LIST OPTIONS".

   list_comments
       Returns comments on photos for the current account or the account given
       by the "user_id" parameter.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       user_id
           This is the ID of the user to search for comments within. The
           comments returned will be commons on photos owned by this user. The
           default is to search the comments of the authenticated user.

       This method also accepts the "STANDARD LIST OPTIONS".

   get_comment
         my $comment = $service->get_comment(
             user_id    => $user_id,
             album_id   => $album_id,
             photo_id   => $photo_id,
             comment_id => $comment_id,
         );

       Retrieves a single comment from Picasa Web via the given "user_id",
       "album_id", "photo_id", and "comment_id". If "user_id" is not given,
       "default" will be used.

       Returns "undef" if no matching comment is found.

   list_media_entries
   list_photos
   list_videos
       Returns photos and videos based on the query options given. If a
       "user_id" option is set, the photos returned will be those related to
       the named user ID. Without a user ID, the photos will be pulled from
       the general community feed.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       user_id
           If given, the photos will be limited to those owned by this user.
           If it is set to "default", then the authenticated user will be
           used. If no "user_id" is set, then the community feed will be used
           rather than a specific user. This option may not be combined with
           "featured".

       featured
           This can be set to a true value to fetch the current featured
           photos on PicasaWeb. This option is not compatible with "user_id".

       This method also accepts the "STANDARD LIST OPTIONS".

       The "list_photos" and "list_videos" methods are synonyms for
       "list_media_entries".

   get_media_entry
   get_photo
   get_video
         my $media_entry = $service->get_media_entry(
             user_id  => $user_id,
             album_id => $album_id,
             photo_id => $photo_id,
         );

       Returns a specific photo or video entry when given a "user_id",
       "album_id", and "photo_id". If "user_id" is not given, "default" will
       be used.

       If no such photo or video can be found, "undef" will be returned.

HELPERS
       These helper methods are used to do some of the work.

   request
         my $response = $service->request($method, $path, $query, $content);

       This handles the details of making a request to the Google Picasa Web
       API.

   get_entry
         my $entry = $service->get_entry($class, $path, %params);

       This is used by the "get_*" methods to pull and initialize a single
       object from Picasa Web.

   list_entries
         my @entries = $service->list_entries($class, $path, %params);

       This is used by the "list_*" methods to pull and initialize lists of
       objects from feeds.

STANDARD LIST OPTIONS
       Several of the listing methods return entries that can be modified by
       setting the following options.

       access
           This is the

       thumbsize
           This option is only used when listing albums and photos or videos.

           By passing a single scalar or an array reference of scalars, e.g.,

           items returned. Please see the
           <http://code.google.com/apis/picasaweb/reference.html#Parameters|parameters>
           documentation for a description of valid values.

       imgmax
           This option is only used when listing albums and photos or videos.

           This is a single scalar selecting the size of the main image to
           return with the items found. Please see the

           documentation for a description of valid values.

       tag This option is only used when listing albums and photos or videos.

           4 values given in the following order: west, south, east, north.

       l   This option is only used when listing albums and photos or videos.

           This may be set to the name of a geo location to search for items
