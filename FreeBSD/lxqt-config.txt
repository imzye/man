NAME
       lxqt-config-appearance - GUI appearance application of LXQt: The
       Lightweight Qt Desktop Environment

SYNOPSIS
       lxqt-config-appearance

DESCRIPTION
       With this application you can set and configure the Qt / LXQt GUI
       appearance. Options include configuring widget style, color palette,
       application toolbar, icon theme, LXQt theme, font, cursor, and
       optionally GTK 2/3 style.

       On Linux/Unix, the look of a GUI application depends on the toolkit it
       is based on.  For LXQt, the overall look of many apps relies on the Qt
       framework GUI. The lxqt-config-appearance application provides all
       aspects of configuring the appearance of the LXQt desktop.

       All the remaining major aspects of LXQt appearance rely on the active
       Qt widget style because the LXQt DE is based on the Qt framework.

OPTIONS
       -v, --version  Displays version information.
       -h, --help     Displays help on command line options.
       --help-all     Displays help, including generic Qt options.
