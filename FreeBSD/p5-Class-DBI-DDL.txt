Class::DBI::DDL::Pg(3)                     User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Class::DBI::DDL::Pg - Perform driver dependent work for PostgreSQL

DESCRIPTION
       Do not use this package directly. Intead, it will automatically be
       imported and used by Class::DBI::DDL when the underlying database uses
       the DBD::Pg driver.

       The only method here that works different from the default is
       "pre_create_table". This method uses the PostgreSQL "SERIAL" type to
       perform auto-increment and sets the "sequence" method since Class::DBI
       doesn't properly handle PostgreSQL auto-numbering.
