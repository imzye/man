DESCRIPTION
       wmenu is a dynamic menu for Wayland, which reads a list of newline-
       separated items from stdin. When the user selects an item and presses
       Return, their choice is printed to stdout and wmenu terminates.
       Entering text will narrow the items to those matching the tokens in the
       input.

       wmenu-run is a special invocation of wmenu which lists programs in the
       user's $PATH and runs the result.
