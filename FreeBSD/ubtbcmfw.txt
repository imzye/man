UBTBCMFW(4)            FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual            UBTBCMFW(4)

NAME
     ubtbcmfw – Firmware driver for Broadcom BCM2033 chip based Bluetooth USB
     devices

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following line in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device ubtbcmfw

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           ubtbcmfw_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The ubtbcmfw is a firmware driver for Broadcom BCM2033 chip based
     Bluetooth USB devices.  It provides minimal access to the parts of the
     device required to download firmware.

     The ubtbcmfw driver creates three fixed endpoint device nodes.

     The control transfers can only happen on the control endpoint which is
     always endpoint 0.  Control requests are issued by ioctl(2) calls.

     Only incoming transfers are supported on an interrupt endpoint.  To
     perform I/O on an interrupt endpoint, read(2) should be used.  All I/O
     operations on an interrupt endpoint are unbuffered.  Interrupt endpoint
     is always endpoint 1.

     Only outgoing bulk transfers are supported on a bulk endpoint.  To
     perform I/O on a bulk endpoint, write(2) should be used.  All I/O
     operations on a bulk endpoint are unbuffered.  Outgoing bulk endpoint is
     always endpoint 2.

     The control endpoint (endpoint 0) handles the following ioctl(2) calls:

     USB_GET_DEVICE_DESC (usb_device_descriptor_t)
             Return the device descriptor.

FILES
     /dev/ubtbcmfwN.EE                           Endpoint EE of device N.
