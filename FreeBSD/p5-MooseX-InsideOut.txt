MooseX::InsideOut(3)  User Contributed Perl Documentation MooseX::InsideOut(3)


NAME
       MooseX::InsideOut - inside-out objects with Moose

VERSION
       version 0.106

SYNOPSIS
         package My::Object;

         use MooseX::InsideOut;

         # ... normal Moose functionality
         # or ...

         package My::Subclass;

         use MooseX::InsideOut;
         extends 'Some::Other::Class';

DESCRIPTION
       MooseX::InsideOut provides metaroles for inside-out objects.  That is,
       it sets up attribute slot storage somewhere other than inside $self.
       This means that you can extend non-Moose classes, whose internals you
       either don't want to care about or aren't hash-based.

METHODS
   init_meta
       Apply the instance metarole necessary for inside-out storage.

TODO
       •   dumping (for debugging purposes)

       •   serialization (for e.g. storable)

       •   (your suggestions here)
