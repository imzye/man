NAME
       jewel - a minimalistic window manager for X11

SYNOPSIS
       jewel -display [display], -fn [font], -fg|-bg|-bd [color], -fm
       [follow|sloppy|click], -bw [width], -md [max desktops], -tj
       [left|center|right], -es [true|false], -wm [true|false],
       -new1|-new2|-newkey [cmd]


DESCRIPTION
       jewel is an X11 window manager with a minimal set of features. It
       provides the most common features found in a window manager. For
       instance you can iconify, maximize, shade and close windows. You can
       separate your windows via virtual desktops. Virtual desktops are
       separate workspaces in which to perform work.  Switching them is as
       easy as pressing alt+ctrl+page up or alt+ctrl+page down key
       combinations.  Alternatively, rolling the mouse wheel on the backdrop
       also works. By default there are 4 virtual desktops.

       jewel was forked from the aewm++ source code. The reason behind this is
       simple. aewm is probably the most popular window manager for hackers to
       fork and hack on. Many window managers were written from its source.
       However the source code is in C and there are hackers out there I am
       sure that would like to hack a small window manager written in C++.
       Hence aewm+ was born. While aewm has minimal features aewm++ will try
       to build upon it with more features that the author feels necessary in
       a good minimal window manager. Jewel was then forked from aewm++ to
       provide extra functionality to the project.

       The titlebar has a lot of functionality. Double clicking with the 1st
       button will maximize a window.  Double clicking a maximized window
       returns it to its original size, Double clicking a shaded window
       unshades the window. Clicking with the first button and dragging will
       move the window. Using the middle button and clicking the titlebar will
       shade the window. Do this again on a shaded window and it unshades it.
       Middle clicking in the box on the right edge of the titlebar will allow
       you to resize the window. Clicking with the 1st button will iconify the
       window. Clicking with the 3rd button will delete the window.

       If there are windows which are iconified you can press the middle
       button on the root window and it will pop up an icon menu. Clicking on
       items in the icon menu will uniconify them.

       Virtual Desktops are cycled with the page up and page down keys. If you
       don't specify the -md [max number of desks]  on the command line then
       you will start with 4 virtual desktops. To move windows between
       desktops right click on the title bar and use the Send to Desktop menu
       item to send it to any of the other desktops.

       jewel is meant to be used with a 3 button mouse. If you don't have one
       feel free to hack the code to change the functionality of the buttons.

       If you middle click on the root window you will see the icon menu,
       listing all windows, iconified or not. If you middle click on the root
       window again while the menu is open it will hide. Icons for the current
       desktop are the only ones that show. Once you switch desktops whatever
       icons on that desktop will show.

       To get the real effect of jewel I highly recommend you use it with
       fspanel. This will give you a nice task bar which will show icons, a
       clock and buttons to switch virtual desktops.


OPTIONS
       -display display
              Specifies which display to start jewel on. This is useful if you
              want to test jewel inside of Xnest.


       -md number
              Specifies the number of max virtual desktops to start with. The
              default number of desktops is 4.


       -tj left|center|right
              Specifies the text justification for window titles in the
              titlebar. The options are left, center or right.


       -es true|false
              Specifies if edge snapping is turned on or not. Edge snapping
              occurs when a window is dragged within 10 pixels of the edge. It
              is then snapped to the edge. Specify true or false with this
              option. Default is true.


       -wm true|false
              Specifies if wire move is on or not. If its off then windows are
              moved via an opaque move. In other words the entire contents of
              the window are moved when the window is dragged. You specify
              true or false with this option. Default is true.


       -fn font-spec
               Draw window titles with the user defined font.


       -fm follow|sloppy|click
              Defines what focus model you wish to use. The choices are follow
              which is focus follows the mouse pointer, sloppy provides focus
              follows mouse with the exception that the root window doesn't
              get focus, and last but not least there is click which provides
              the click to focus model. Clicking on a window will give it
              focus until another client is clicked then focus is transferred
              to that client.

              Defines how wide window borders will be.

              Change the command executed when each mouse button is clicked on
              the root window, or when Ctrl-Alt-Enter is pressed.
