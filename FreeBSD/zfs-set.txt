ZFS-SET(8)              FreeBSD System Manager's Manual             ZFS-SET(8)

NAME
     zfs-set – set properties on ZFS datasets

SYNOPSIS
     zfs set property=value [property=value]… filesystem|volume|snapshot…
     zfs get [-r|-d depth] [-Hp] [-o field[,field]…] [-s source[,source]…]
         [-t type[,type]…] all|property[,property]…
         [filesystem|volume|snapshot|bookmark]…
     zfs inherit [-rS] property filesystem|volume|snapshot…

DESCRIPTION
     zfs set property=value [property=value]… filesystem|volume|snapshot…
       Only some properties can be edited.  See zfsprops(7) for more
       information on what properties can be set and acceptable values.
       Numeric values can be specified as exact values, or in a human-readable
       form with a suffix of B, K, M, G, T, P, E, Z (for bytes, kilobytes,
       megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes, petabytes, exabytes, or zettabytes,
       respectively).  User properties can be set on snapshots.  For more
       information, see the User Properties section of zfsprops(7).

     zfs get [-r|-d depth] [-Hp] [-o field[,field]…] [-s source[,source]…] [-t
       type[,type]…] all|property[,property]…
       [filesystem|volume|snapshot|bookmark]…
       Displays properties for the given datasets.  If no datasets are
       specified, then the command displays properties for all datasets on the
       system.  For each property, the following columns are displayed:
           name      Dataset name
           property  Property name
           value     Property value
           source    Property source local, default, inherited, temporary,
                     received, or - (none).

       All columns are displayed by default, though this can be controlled by
       using the -o option.  This command takes a comma-separated list of
       properties as described in the Native Properties and User Properties
       sections of zfsprops(7).

       The value all can be used to display all properties that apply to the
       given dataset's type (filesystem, volume, snapshot, or bookmark).

       -H         Display output in a form more easily parsed by scripts.  Any
                  headers are omitted, and fields are explicitly separated by
                  a single tab instead of an arbitrary amount of space.

       -d depth   Recursively display any children of the dataset, limiting
                  the recursion to depth.  A depth of 1 will display only the
                  dataset and its direct children.

       -o field   A comma-separated list of columns to display, defaults to
                  name,property,value,source.

       -p         Display numbers in parsable (exact) values.

       -r         Recursively display properties for any children.

       -s source  A comma-separated list of sources to display.  Those
                  properties coming from a source other than those in this
                  list are ignored.  Each source must be one of the following:
                  local, default, inherited, temporary, received, or none.
                  The default value is all sources.

       -t type    A comma-separated list of types to display, where type is
                  one of filesystem, snapshot, volume, bookmark, or all.

     zfs inherit [-rS] property filesystem|volume|snapshot…
       Clears the specified property, causing it to be inherited from an
       ancestor, restored to default if no ancestor has the property set, or
       with the -S option reverted to the received value if one exists.  See
       zfsprops(7) for a listing of default values, and details on which
       properties can be inherited.

       -r  Recursively inherit the given property for all children.

       -S  Revert the property to the received value if one exists; otherwise
           operate as if the -S option was not specified.
