NAME
       Chemistry::File::PDB - Protein Data Bank file format reader/writer

SYNOPSIS
           use Chemistry::File::PDB;

           # read a PDB file
           my $macro_mol = Chemistry::MacroMol->read("myfile.pdb");

           # write a PDB file
           $macro_mol->write("out.pdb");

           # read all models in a multi-model file
           my @mols = Chemistry::MacroMol->read("models.pdb");

           # read one model at a time
           my $file = Chemistry::MacroMol->file("models.pdb");
           $file->open;
           while (my $mol = $file->read_mol($file->fh)) {
               # do something with $mol
           }

DESCRIPTION
       This module reads and writes PDB files. The PDB file format is commonly
       used to describe proteins, particularly those stored in the Protein
       Data Bank (<http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/>). The current version of this
       module only reads the following record types, ignoring everything else:

           ATOM
           HETATM
           ENDMDL
           END

       This module automatically registers the 'pdb' format with
       Chemistry::Mol, so that PDB files may be identified and read by
       Chemistry::Mol->read(). For autodetection purpuses, it assumes that
       files ending in .pdb or having a line matching /^(ATOM  |HETATM)/ are
       PDB files.

       The PDB reader and writer is designed for dealing with
       Chemistry::MacroMol objects, but it can also create and use
       Chemistry::Mol objects by throwing some information away.

   Properties
       When reading and writing files, this module stores or gets some of the
       information in the following places:

       $domain->type
           The residue type, such as "ARG".

       $domain->name
           The type and sequence number, such as "ARG114".

       $domain->attr("pdb/sequence_number")
           The residue sequence number as given in the PDB file.

       $domain->attr("pdb/chain_id")
           The chain to which this residue belongs (one character).

       $domain->attr("pdb/insertion_code")
           The residue insertion code (see the PDB specification for details).

       $atom->name
           The PDB atom name, such as "CA".

       $atom->attr("pdb/residue_name")
           The name of the residue, as discussed above.

       $atom->attr("pdb/serial_number")
           The serial number for the atom, as given in the PDB file.

       If some of this information is not available when writing a PDB file,
       this module tries to make it up (by counting the atoms or residues, for
       example).  The default residue name for writing is UNK (unknown). Atom
       names are just the atomic symbols.

   Multi-model files
       If a PDB file has multiple models (separated by END or ENDMDL records),
       each call to read_mol will return one model.

   Output features
       On writing Chemistry::Mol objects, which don't have macromolecule
       information and usually don't have atom names, the atom names are made
       up by concatenating the atomic symbol with a unique ID (up to 1296
       atoms are possible). The ID can be disabled by setting the option
       'noid':

           $mol->write("out.pdb", noid => 1);

       The molecule's name is written as a HEADER record; A REMARK record is
       added listing the version of Chemistry::File::PDB that was used.

       There is another PDB reader in Perl, as part of the BioPerl project:
       Bio::Structure::IO::pdb.
