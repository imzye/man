Term::App::Role::Attrs(3)                  User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Term::App::Role::Attrs - Role for terminal-related attributes

VERSION
       This document describes version 0.031 of Term::App::Role::Attrs (from
       Perl distribution Term-App-Roles), released on 2020-06-08.

DESCRIPTION
       This role gives several options to turn on/off terminal-oriented
       features like whether to use UTF8 characters, whether to use colors,
       and color depth. Defaults are set from environment variables or by
       detecting terminal software/capabilities.

ATTRIBUTES
   use_utf8 => BOOL (default: from env, or detected from terminal)
       The default is retrieved from environment: if "UTF8" is set, it is
       used.  Otherwise, the default is on if terminal emulator software
       supports Unicode and language (LANG/LANGUAGE) setting has /utf-?8/i in
       it.

   use_box_chars => BOOL (default: from env, or detected from OS)
       Default is 0 for Windows.

   interactive => BOOL (default: from env, or detected from terminal)
   use_color => BOOL (default: from env, or detected from terminal)
       For convenience, this attribute is "linked" with "color_depth". Setting
       "use_color" will also set "color_depth" when the value is not ''/1/0
       and matches color depth pattern. For example, setting "use_color" to
       256 or '8bit' will also set "color_depth" to 256.

   color_depth => INT (or STR, default: from env, or detected from terminal)
       Get/set color depth. When setting, you can use string like '8 bit' or
       '24b' and it will be converted to 256 (2**8) or 16777216 (2**24).

       For convenience, this attribute is "linked" with "use_color". Setting
       "color_depth" to non-zero value will enable "use_color", while setting
       it to 0 will disable "use_color".

   term_width => INT (default: from env, or detected from terminal)
   term_height => INT (default: from env, or detected from terminal)

METHODS
   detect_terminal() => HASH
       Call Term::Detect::Software's "detect_terminal_cached".

ENVIRONMENT
       •   UTF8 => BOOL

           Can be used to set "use_utf8".

       •   INTERACTIVE => BOOL

           Can be used to set "interactive".

       •   NO_COLOR

       •   COLOR => BOOL (or INT or STR)

           Can be used to set "use_color". Can also be used to set
           "color_depth" (if "COLOR_DEPTH" is not defined).

       •   COLOR_DEPTH => INT (or STR)

           Can be used to set "color_depth". Can also be used to
           enable/disable "use_color".

       •   BOX_CHARS => BOOL

           Can be used to set "use_box_chars".

       •   COLUMNS => INT

           Can be used to set "term_width".

       •   LINES => INT

           Can be used to set "term_height".
