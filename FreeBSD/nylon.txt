NAME
     nylon – a lightweight and highly configurable proxy server

SYNOPSIS
     nylon [-h] [-v] [-V] [-f] [-s] [-n] [-4] [-5] [-a list] [-d list]
           [-m addr] [-p port] [-i ip/if] [-I ip/if] [-P file] [-c file]

DESCRIPTION
     nylon is a proxy server.  This version supports SOCKS 4 and SOCKS 5
     protocols, as well as a mirror mode.  nylon is fully configurable, and
     can be configured from either the command line or a provided
     configuration file.

     The options are as follows:

     -h           Displays help.

     -v           Increases the verbosity level (can be specified multiple
                  times).

     -V           Prints version.

     -f           Runs nylon in the foreground and prints all output to the
                  terminal.

     -s           Forces all output to syslog.

     -n           Shows all network addresses as numbers.

     -4           Disables SOCKS4 support

     -5           Disables SOCKS5 support

     -a list      Sets the host allow list to list.

     -d list      Sets the host deny list to list.

     -m addr      Runs nylon in mirror mode.  In this mode, any proxy protocol
                  negotiations are disregarded, and the address provided is
                  simply mirrored.  addr is in "host:port" format and
                  specifies the target machine and port to mirror.  If no
                  local binding port is specified (via the p switch, or in the
                  configuration file), nylon will bind to a local port
                  matching the remote port specified.

     -p port      Bind server to port port.  By default, nylon will bind to
                  the "socks" port (1080).

     -i ip/if     Bind server to the interface or address ip/if.

     -I ip/if     Make outgoing connections through the interface or address
                  ip/if.

     -P file      Specify PID file file.  By default, /var/run/nylon.pid is
                  used.

     -c file      Specify configuration file file.

     The configuration file can be used as a replacement for the command line
     options.  Please see the provided file nylon.conf for more information.

ACCESS
     Access to the services provided by nylon are governed by the the host
     allow and deny lists.  These are lists composed of hosts and networks.
     Hosts can be specified either by their hostname, or their IP address.
     Networks are specified by a network address and mask in the form
     "address/bits", where "bits" specifies how many bits of the address are
     to be used to represent the network mask.

     Given an address, whether access is given or not is determined as such.
     If the address matches any address in the deny list, access is explicitly
     denied.  If the address matches any address in the allow list, access is
     explititly allowed, unless it is also matched in the deny list.  If the
     deny list is empty, only addresses in the allow list are allowed.  If the
     allow list is empty, all addresses, except for those that are in the deny
     list, are allowed

     By default, the allow list is set to "localhost" and the deny list set to
     "" (empty).

EXAMPLES
     nylon -i fxp1 -a "localhost trusted.com 10.0.0.0/24" -m cnn.com:http

     Mirrors the http service on cnn.com onto the local http port.  Only hosts
     coming from localhost, trusted.com and the network 10.0.0.0/24 are
     allowed to use this mirroring service.  Additionally, the server binds to
     the IP address belonging to the ethernet interface fxp1.

     nylon -f -a "" -d "nasty.com intruders.com" -vvvvvv

     Runs nylon as a SOCKS server in the foreground.  All hosts except for
     nasty.com and intruders.com are allowed to access the service.  nylon
     runs with a high verbosity level.

STANDARDS
     The nylon server complies with the SOCKS5 (RFC 1928) and SOCKS4
     specifications.
