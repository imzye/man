NAME
       dvbcut - Qt application for cutting parts out of DVB streams

SYNOPSIS
       dvbcut [ -idx indexfile ] [ mpegfile ]
       dvbcut projectfile
       dvbcut -generateidx -idx indexfile mpegfile

DESCRIPTION
       DVBCUT is a Qt application that allows you to select certain parts of
       an MPEG transport stream (as received via Digital Video Broadcasting,
       DVB) and save these parts into a single MPEG output file. It follows a
       ``keyhole surgery'' approach where the input video and audio data is
       mostly kept unchanged, and only very few frames at the beginning and/or
       end of the selected range are re-encoded in order to obtain a valid
       MPEG file.
       DVBCUT needs to create index information on an MPEG file first.
       Therefore, when loading an MPEG transport stream file, it also asks you
       for a filename of an index file. If you choose an existing file, it is
       loaded and used as index if suitable. (That means, that dvbcut performs
       some sanity checks on the index itself and also checks if the index
       describes the chosen MPEG file.) If you select a file which does not
       yet exist, dvbcut creates the necessary index in place.

OPTIONS
       -idx indexfile
              Use indexfile as index.

       -generateidx
              Do not show the graphical user interface, only generate an
              index.
