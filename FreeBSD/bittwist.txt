NAME
       bittwist -- pcap based ethernet packet generator

SYNOPSIS
       bittwist [ -djvh ] [ -i interface ] [ -s len ] [ -l loop ]
                [ -c count ] [ -p pps ] [ -r rate ] [ -t gap ]
                pcap-file(s)

DESCRIPTION
       This document describes the bittwist program, the pcap(3) based
       Ethernet packet generator. Bittwist is designed to work under Ethernet
       II (IEEE 802.3) network with an MTU of up to 1500 bytes on 10Mbps
       (10Base-T), 100Mbps (100BASE-TX), 1Gbps (1000BASE-T), or 10Gbps
       (10GBASE-T) link speed. Packets are generated from saved tcpdump(1)
       capture file referred to as trace file in this document. Some
       familiarity with tcpdump(1) and its basic options are assumed in this
       document. Since bittwist uses functions provided by pcap(3) library,
       e.g. pcap_open_live() and pcap_sendpacket(), to write packets onto the
       network, it may require that you have special privileges, e.g. read
       access to /dev/bpf* on BSD or root access on Linux, to generate packets
       or to enumerate network devices with, for example, the -d flag.

       Bittwist will, if not run with the -s flag, inject each packet up to
       its actual length (on-wire) instead of its captured length. If the
       captured length is less than the actual length, bittwist will pad the
       packet with zeros up to its actual length prior to injection. Bittwist
       will, if not run with the -p, -r, or -t flag, inject packets from a
       trace file based on the captured intervals, in particular, the
       timestamp difference between two adjacent packets, except for the first
       packet in a trace file, which is always injected immediately. Bittwist
       is designed to not to interfere with the packet data; it merely read a
       packet and inject it as is onto the network. If modification is desired
       prior to injection of a packet, you can use the bittwiste(1) program,
       which does just that.

OPTIONS
       -d     Print a list of network interfaces available.

       -j     Enable jumbo frame with an MTU of up to 9000 bytes. Specify this
              flag if you wish to send packets with length greater than the
              typical MTU of 1500 bytes.

       -v     Print timestamp for each packet.

       -vv    Print timestamp and hex data for each packet.

       -i interface
              Send pcap-file(s) out onto the network through interface.

       -s len Packet length to send (in bytes). Set len to:

               0 : Send the actual packet length. This is the default.
              -1 : Send the captured length.

              or any other value from 14 to 9014. Value greater than 1514
              requires -j flag to be specified.

       -l loop
              Send pcap-file(s) out onto the network for loop times. Set loop
              to 0 to send pcap-file(s) until stopped. To stop, type Control-
              C.

       -c count
              Send up to count packets. Default is to send all packets from
              pcap-file(s).

       -p pps Send pps packets per second. Value for pps must be between 1 to
              1000000. This flag takes precedence over the -r flag.

       -r rate
              Limit the sending to rate Mbps. Value for rate must be between 0
              to 10000. This flag is intended to set the desired packet
              throughput. If you want to send packets at line rate of 1000
              Mbps, try -r 1000. If you want to send packets without rate
              limit, try -r 0. This flag is typically used with -l 0 to send
              pcap-file(s) until stopped.  This flag takes precedence over the
              -t flag.

       -t gap Set inter-packet gap in seconds, ignoring the captured interval
              between packets in pcap-file(s). Value for gap must be between 1
              to 86400.

       -h     Print version information and usage.

BUGS
       File your bug report and send to:

              Addy Yeow <ayeowch@gmail.com>

       Make sure you are using the latest stable version before submitting
       your bug report.

       If you run bittwist with -r flag, pcap_sendpacket() may return an error
       with the following error string:

              send: No buffer space available

       We recommend that you adjust the value for -r flag to limit the packet
       throughput to a lower level that is supported by your interface, e.g.
       start from -r 10 to inject packets at a maximum rate of 10Mbps and
       adjust the value accordingly.
