NAME
       assp - Anti-Spam SMTP Proxy

SYNOPSIS
       assp [ base_dir [ admin_port ] ]

       %%RC_SCRIPT%% start|stop|restart|status

DESCRIPTION
       Anti-Spam SMTP Proxy is a spam filter that sits on port 25 in front of
       your regular SMTP server (exim(8), postfix(8), qmail(8), sendmail(8),
       etc).

       ASSP relays the SMTP dialog between an incoming client and your SMTP
       server, intercepting the dialog as needed.  ASSP performs a number of
       configurable spam checks and on detecting a spam message provides an
       immediate 5xx SMTP error code back to the client.  Non-spam messages
       are passed to your regular SMTP server for further processing and
       delivery.  Spam messages can be blocked from delivery or subject-tagged
       and delivered.

       ASSP offers:

              - a whitelist of known good senders

              - Bayesian checks on message headers and contents

              - local user validation using RFC822 checks, flat lists or LDAP
                lookup

              - relay denial

              - HELO checking

              - SPF (Sender Policy Framework) checking

              - DNSBL (DNS Block List) checking using many block list services

              - delaying of messages from unknown senders

              - Virus detection

       ASSP is entirely administrator-managed and is almost totally
       transparent to users.  In particular, users do not need to manage
       procmail(1) spam filters or challenge-response systems of their own.

       The base_dir argument gives the name of ASSP's working directory.  If
       omitted it defaults to the current directory.

       ASSP is configured using a web interface.  The admin_port argument
       gives the network port for accessing ASSP's configuration menu.  It
       defaults to 55555.  To access the configuration menu, start ASSP and
       then point your browser at http://localhost:55555.  The default admin
       password is nospam4me.

       Initial setup of ASSP involves several steps:

       1.     Review ASSP's configuration options and adjust as necessary.  Be
              sure to change the admin password.  By default ASSP's filters
              are all set to Test Mode which means all messages will be
              delivered to their recipients.  Leave everything in Test Mode
              for now.

       2.     Decide on which network port(s) ASSP will listen and on which
              your normal SMTP server will listen.  Typically, ASSP will
              listen on port 25 and your SMTP server will be moved to
              something like port 125 or 587.

       3.     Reconfigure your SMTP server to its new port.

       4.     Reconfigure ASSP to port 25 and restart ASSP.  Since ASSP is in
              Test Mode, all messages will be delivered to their recipients.

       5.     Arrange for all users' outbound email to be processed by ASSP.
              This is necessary for ASSP to be able to automatically maintain
              its whitelist.  If a user's MUA uses SMTP to port 25, this will
              happen without further intervention.  If an MUA invokes
              /usr/sbin/sendmail and you're using the default sendmail(8)
              configuration with submit queues, this will also happen without
              further intervention.  Otherwise, you need to take whatever
              steps are necessary for each MUA that's being used.

       6.     Optionally, send a message containing a list of email addresses
              that you want to receive email from to asspwhite@yourdomain.com.
              Have all your users do this.  This will seed ASSP's whitelist.
              Messages from senders on the whitelist will never be blocked.
              An address can be removed from the whitelist by emailing it to
              asspnotwhite@yourdomain.com.

       7.     To set up the Bayesian word list filtering, do the following:

              7a.    Ensure some senders' addresses are in the whitelist,
                     either by sending email to them or by seeding the
                     whilelist as described above.

              7b.    Allow some time (could be hours or days, depending on the
                     volume of email you receive) for enough email to collect.
                     Mesages from senders on the whitelist will be copied in
                     the notspam directory.  Other messages will either be
                     passed or be copied in the spam directory based on word
                     scores in the initial greylist.

              7c.    Periodically examine the messages in ASSP's notspam and
                     spam directories to make sure they're sorted correctly.
                     Move any to the other directory as needed.  If you're
                     unsure about a particular message, just delete it.  Also,
                     examine maillog.txt for information about what ASSP is
                     doing.

              7d.    After about 400 messages have collected, filtering mode
                     can be enabled.  In the /var/db/assp directory, run the
                     /usr/local/lib/assp/rebuildspamdb.pl script to create the
                     spam database from the logged messages.  This is the part
                     where the Bayesian filter ``learns'' about the words in
                     your spam and notspam collections.

              7e.    Uncheck the appropriate Test Mode box in ASSP's
                     configuration menu to enable message blocking.

              7f.    It is recommended that the UseSubjectsAsMaillogNames
                     configuration option is eventually unchecked and that the
                     script /usr/local/lib/assp/move2num.pl is run in the
                     /var/db/assp directory.  This causes messages to be
                     stored with numeric filenames, and overwritten after some
                     time.  The benefits of this are that the size of the
                     stored messages will be limited and that older messages
                     are removed from the collection.  This keeps the Bayesian
                     word list current.  This need not be done immediately;
                     you can do this once you no longer feel the need to
                     examine the spam messages in detail.

       8.     ASSP's other filtering options (local user validation, RFC822
              conformance, client HELO validation, SPF validation, the Delay
              List, the use of DNSBLs and the ClamAV virus checker) can be
              enabled by examining and adjusting their configuration options
              as needed and then unchecking the appropriate Test Mode boxes.

       Once ASSP is live, users should forward a copy of any spam message that
       still gets through to asspspam@yourdomain.com in order to add it to
       ASSP's spam database.  Any non-spam that was mis-classified as spam can
       be copied to asspnotspam@yourdomain.com.

       The rebuildspamdb.pl script needs to be re-run periodically to update
       the spam database from the latest logged messages.  There is a
       periodic(8) script that will do this overnight.
