NAME
     pom – display the phase of the moon

SYNOPSIS
     pom [-p] [-d yyyy.mm.dd] [-t hh:mm:ss]

DESCRIPTION
     The pom utility displays the current phase of the moon.  Useful for
     selecting software completion target dates and predicting managerial
     behavior.

     Use the -p option to print just the phase as a percentage.

     Use the arguments -d and -t to specify a specific date and time for which
     the phase of the moon has to be calculated.  If -d but not -t has been
     specified, it will calculate the phase of the moon on that day at
     midnight.
