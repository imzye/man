NAME
       DNS::LDNS - Perl extension for the ldns library

SYNOPSIS
         use DNS::LDNS ':all'

DESCRIPTION
       DNS::LDNS is a perl OO-wrapper for the ldns library. A complete list of
       object methods is found in the perldoc for each of the individual
       classes. You may also read the documentation of the ldns library
       (http://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/ldns).

   Brief examples of usage
         use DNS::LDNS ':all';

         my $z = new DNS::LDNS::Zone(filename => '/path/to/myzone');
         print DNS::LDNS::last_error;
         my $rr = new DNS::LDNS::RR('mylabel 3600 IN A 168.10.10.10');
         print $z->soa->to_string;
         my $rrlist = $z->rrs->push($rr);
         print $z->to_string;

         my $kl = new DNS::LDNS::KeyList;
         $kl->push(new DNS::LDNS::Key(filename => 'key');
         $kl->key(0)->set_pubkey_owner(
             new DNS::LDNS::RData(LDNS_RDF_TYPE_DNAME, 'myzone.org'));
         my $signedz = $z->sign($kl);
         print $signedz->to_string;

         my $r = new DNS::LDNS::Resolver(filename => '/my/resolv.conf');
         my $p = $r->send(
           new DNS::LDNS::RData(LDNS_RDF_TYPE_DNAME, 'www.google.com'),
           LDNS_RR_TYPE_A, LDNS_RR_CLASS_IN, LDNS_RD);
         print $p->answer->to_string;
         print $p->authority->to_string;

   Classes
       A description of the classes included and how they map to the ldns
       library structures:

                           to represent an RRSet if all the dnames and types
                           are equal, (maps to the the ldns_rr_list struct)

       DNS::LDNS::RR       Represents a resource record (RR), (maps to the
                           ldns_rr struct)

       DNS::LDNS::RData    Represents an rdata field or a dname in an RR (maps
                           to the ldns_rdf struct)

       DNS::LDNS::DNSSecZone
                           Represents a zone with dnssec data (maps to the
                           ldns_dnssec_zone struct)

       DNS::LDNS::RBTree   Represents a tree of DNSSecName nodes (maps to the
                           ldns_rbtree struct)

       DNS::LDNS::RBNode   Represents a node in the RBTree (maps to the
                           ldns_rbnode struct)

       DNS::LDNS::DNSSecName
                           Represents a dname in a DNSSecZone and holds a
                           DNSSecRRSets list for this  dname, possibly with
                           signatures (maps to the ldns_dnssec_name struct)

       DNS::LDNS::DNSSecRRSets
                           Represents a linked list of DNSSec RR sets,
                           possibly with signatures (maps  to the
                           ldns_dnssec_rrsets struct)

       DNS::LDNS::DNSSecRRs
                           Represents a linked list of RRs (maps to the
                           ldns_dnssec_rrs struct)

       DNS::LDNS::DNSSecDataChain
                           Represents a chain of RR, DNSKEY, and DS data used
                           for building a dnssec  trust tree (maps to the
                           ldns_dnssec_data_chain struct)

       DNS::LDNS::DNSSecTrustTree
                           Represents a tree of chained trust relationships
                           from a signed RR to a set  of trust anchors (maps
                           to the ldns_dnssec_trust_tree struct).

       DNS::LDNS::GC       Garbage collector. Handles ownership dependencies
                           and freeing data used by  the other classes. Used
                           internally only.

       One thing to note is that some of the classes have a seemingly
       overlapping  functionality. The Zone and RRList are used to represent a
       generic zone. It  may contain dnssec data but treats it like any other
       dns data and does not  have any knowledge of its structure. The DNSSec*
       and RB* classes are  building blocks for representing a signed zone in
       a more structured way.

   Static functions
         str = rr_type2str(type)
         str = rr_class2str(class)
         type = rr_type_by_name(str)
         class = rr_class_by_name(str)
         str = pkt_opcode2str(opcode)
         str = pkt_rcode2str(rcode)
         error = errorstr_by_id(status)
         str = DNS::LDNS::last_error
         status = DNS::LDNS::last_status
         rr = dnssec_create_nsec(from, to, type)
         rr = dnssec_create_nsec3(from, to, algorithm, flags, iterations, salt)
         rr = create_nsec(current, next, rrs)
         rr = create_nsec3(cur_owner, cur_zone, algorithm, flags,
                           iterations, salt, empty_nonterminals)
         algo = signing_algorithm_by_name(name)
         bool = key_algorithm_supported(algorithm)
         rr = read_anchor_file(filename)

   Object references and cloning
       Since some of the objects are found as sub objects within other
       objects, it  is important to know how the wrapper classes handle object
       references,  dependencies and cloning. The general rule is that
       accessor methods just  return a reference to the object while methods
       inserting data inserts inserts  a clone of the object. Most classes
       have a clone method which can be used if  a cloned object is what you
       really want.

       Examples

       DNS::LDNS::Zone::rrs returns a reference to the DNS::LDNS::RRList
       within  the zone, so if you make changes to the RRList you also changes
       the Zone  object.

       DNS::LDNS::RRList::push(rr) clones the rr, then pushes the cloned rr to
       the  list. Changing the rr afterwards will not change the list.

       An exception is the Key class which does not have a clone mechanism. In
       this  case we allow a free Key to be added to only one KeyList. Adding
       it to  multiple lists will provoke an error.

       The wrapper keeps track of allocated data structures and references.
       Whenever data is no longer referred to by a perl object, it will be
       freed.

   ERROR HANDLING
       The purpose for writing this wrapper class has been to be able to
       process zone file data with good time performance. Data checking and
       error handling is a bit sparse.

       Most constructors will update the DNS::LDNS::last_status variable if
       they fail (return undef). Wrapper methods to ldns functions which would
       return a status will update the static DNS::LDNS::last_status variable.
       Most methods do not return a status and will not reset this variable
       even though they succeeds.

   EXPORT
       None by default.
