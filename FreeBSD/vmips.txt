NAME
       vmips - VMIPS R3000-based MIPS simulator (running and customizing)

SYNOPSIS
               vmips [-n] [-F FILE] [-o option_string] ... rom_file
               vmips --help
               vmips --version
               vmips --print-config

DESCRIPTION
       When you invoke vmips, it loads a ROM file specified on the command
       line, initializes and resets the MIPS processor, and begins execution
       at the first address of the ROM file, which is normally loaded at
       address 0xbfc00000.

OPTIONS
       This is what the different command line options mean:

       -F FILE
           Read options from FILE instead of the .vmipsrc in your home
           directory.

       -n  Do not read the system-wide configuration file, usually called
           /usr/local/etc/vmipsrc.

       --help
           Prints a short summary of VMIPS command line options, and exits
           successfully.

       --version
           Prints a short summary of VMIPS version and copyright information,
           and exits successfully.

       --print-config
           Prints a short summary of VMIPS compile-time configuration
           information, and exits successfully.

       -o something
           Set the option "something" as if "something" were in your .vmipsrc
           file.  See the "VMIPS options" section of the "Customizing" chapter
           for more information on what kind of things can go in your .vmipsrc
           file. You can use as many -o options on the command line as your
           shell will let you.

       rom_file
           Use the named file as the ROM file VMIPS should boot. This option
           is mandatory.

FILES
   VMIPS options
       The VMIPS simulator gets runtime options from four different sources,
       in this order: first, it checks its compile-time defaults, which are
       set by the site administrator in the source file optiontbl.h. Then, the
       system-wide configuration file is read, unless you specify the -n
       option; usually this file is called /usr/local/etc/vmipsrc, but it may
       have been moved by the site administrator or by the maintainers of your
       distribution.  (This is configurable in the source file options.h, and
       by specifying the --prefix and --sysconfdir options to the GNU
       configure script when building VMIPS.) Next, it checks the user's own
       configuration file, usually the file .vmipsrc in your home directory,
       or whatever file you specify using the -F option. Last, it reads the
       command line, and gets any options listed there.

   Format of the configuration file
       The configuration file may contain as many options per line as you
       want, provided no single line exceeds 1,024 characters in length.
       Whitespace separates options from one another.  Single quotes and
       backslash are valid in the configuration file. Their meanings are
       similar to those found in the Bourne shell: any text within paired
       single quotes is uninterpreted, as is any character immediately
       following a backslash.  A comment is any text starting from a hash mark
       to the end of the line, inclusive.

       A string or number option named NAME can appear as NAME=VALUE, where
       VALUE is the string or number in question.  If the number begins with
       0x, it will be interpreted as a 32-bit hexadecimal number, and if it
       begins with 0, it will be interpreted as octal. Otherwise, it will be
       interpreted as a decimal number. Numbers are always unsigned. A Boolean
       option named NAME can appear as either NAME (to set it to TRUE) or
       noNAME (to set it to FALSE).

   Summary of configuration options
       The following is a list of the configuration options present in this
       version of VMIPS.

       haltdumpcpu (type: Boolean)

        Controls whether the CPU registers and stack will be dumped
       on halt. For the output format, please see the description of the
       B<dumpcpu> option, below.  The default value is FALSE.

       haltdumpcp0 (type: Boolean)

        Controls whether the system control coprocessor (CP0) registers
       and the contents of the translation lookaside buffer (TLB) will be
       dumped on halt. For the output format, please see the description
       of the B<dumpcp0> option, below.  The default value is FALSE.

       excpriomsg (type: Boolean)

        Controls whether exception prioritizing messages will
       be printed.  These messages attempt to explain which of
       a number of exceptions caused by the same instruction
       will be reported.  The default value is FALSE.

       excmsg (type: Boolean)

        Controls whether every exception will cause a message
       to be printed. The message gives the exception code, a
       short explanation of the exception code, its priority,
       the delay slot state of the virtual CPU, and states
       what type of memory access the exception was caused by,
       if applicable. Interrupt exceptions are only printed if
       B<reportirq> is also set; when they occur, they also have Cause
       and Status register information printed. TLB misses will have fault
       address and user/kernel mode information printed.  The default value is FALSE.

       bootmsg (type: Boolean)

        Controls whether boot-time and halt-time messages will be printed.
       These include ROM image size, self test messages, reset and halt
       announcements, and possibly other messages.  The default value is TRUE.

       instdump (type: Boolean)

        Controls whether every instruction executed will be disassembled
       and printed.  The default value is FALSE. The output is in the following format:

               PC=0xbfc00000 [1fc00000]    24000000 li $zero,0

       The first column contains the PC (program counter), followed by the
       physical translation of that address in brackets. The third column
       contains the machine instruction word at that address, followed by the
       assembly language corresponding to that word.  All of the constants
       except for the assembly language are in hexadecimal.

       dumpcpu (type: Boolean)

        Controls whether the CPU registers and stack will be dumped after every
       instruction.  The default value is FALSE. The output is in the following format:

               Reg Dump: [ PC=bfc00180  LastInstr=0000000d  HI=00000000  LO=00000000
                           DelayState=NORMAL  DelayPC=bfc00308  NextEPC=bfc00308
                R00=00000000  R01=00000000  R02=00000000  R03=a00c000e  R04=0000000a
                ...
                R30=00000000  R31=bfc00308  ]
               Stack: 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 a2000008 a2000008 ...

       (Some values have been omitted for brevity.)  Here, PC is the program
       counter, LastInstr is the last instruction executed, HI and LO are the
       multiplication/division result registers, DelayState and DelayPC are
       used in delay slot processing, NextEPC is what the Exception PC would
       be if an exception were to occur, and R00 ... R31 are the CPU general
       purpose registers. Stack represents the top few words on the stack.
       All values are in hexadecimal.

       dumpcp0 (type: Boolean)

        Controls whether the system control coprocessor (CP0)
       registers and the contents of the translation lookaside buffer
       (TLB) will be dumped after every instruction.   The default value is FALSE.
       The output is in the following format:

               CP0 Dump Registers: [        R00=00000000  R01=00003200
                R02=00000000  R03=00000000  R04=001fca10  R05=00000000
                R06=00000000  R07=00000000  R08=7fb7e0aa  R09=00000000
                R10=00000000  R11=00000000  R12=00485e60  R13=f0002124
                R14=bfc00308  R15=0000703b ]
               Dump TLB: [
               Entry 00: (00000fc000000000) V=00000 A=3f P=00000 ndvg
               Entry 01: (00000fc000000000) V=00000 A=3f P=00000 ndvg
               Entry 02: (00000fc000000000) V=00000 A=3f P=00000 ndvg
               Entry 03: (00000fc000000000) V=00000 A=3f P=00000 ndvg
               Entry 04: (00000fc000000000) V=00000 A=3f P=00000 ndvg
               Entry 05: (00000fc000000000) V=00000 A=3f P=00000 ndvg
               ...
               Entry 63: (00000fc000000000) V=00000 A=3f P=00000 ndvg
               ]

       Each of the R00 .. R15 are coprocessor zero registers, in hexadecimal.
       The Entry 00 .. 63 lines are TLB entries. The 64-bit number in
       parentheses is the hexadecimal raw value of the entry. V is the virtual
       page number. A is the ASID. P is the physical page number. NDVG are the
       Non-cacheable, Dirty, Valid, and Global bits, uppercase if on,
       lowercase if off.

       haltibe (type: Boolean)

        If B<haltibe> is set to TRUE, the virtual machine will halt
       after an instruction fetch causes a bus error (exception
       code 6, Instruction bus error). This is useful if you
       are expecting execution to jump to nonexistent addresses in
       memory, and you want it to stop instead of calling the
       exception handler.  It is important to note that the machine
       halts after the exception is processed.  The default value is TRUE.

       haltbreak (type: Boolean)

        If B<haltbreak> is set to TRUE, the virtual machine will halt
       when a breakpoint exception is encountered (exception
       code 9). This is equivalent to halting when a C<break>
       instruction is encountered. It is important to note that the
       machine halts after the breakpoint exception is processed.  The default value is TRUE.

       haltdevice (type: Boolean)

        If B<haltdevice> is set to TRUE, the halt device is mapped into
       physical memory, otherwise it is not.  The default value is TRUE.

       instcounts (type: Boolean)

        Set B<instcounts> to TRUE if you want to see instruction
       counts, a rough estimate of total runtime, and execution
       speed in instructions per second when the virtual
       machine halts.  The default value is FALSE.  The output is printed
       at the end of the run, and is in the following format:

               7337 instructions in 0.0581 seconds (126282.271 instructions per second)

       romfile (type: string)

        This is the name of the file which will be initially
       loaded into memory (at the address given in B<loadaddr>,
       typically 0xbfc00000) and executed when the virtual
       machine is reset.  The default value is "romfile.rom".

       loadaddr (type: number)

        This is the virtual address where the ROM will be loaded.
       Note that the MIPS reset exception vector is always 0xbfc00000
       so unless you're doing something incredibly clever you should
       plan to have some executable code at that address. Since the
       caches and TLB are in an indeterminate state at the time of
       reset, the load address must be in uncacheable memory which
       is not mapped through the TLB (kernel segment "kseg1"). This
       effectively constrains the valid range of load addresses to
       between 0xa0000000 and 0xc0000000.  The default value is 0xbfc00000.

       memsize (type: number)

        This variable controls the size of the virtual CPU's "physical"
       memory in bytes.  The default value is 0x100000.

       memdump (type: Boolean)

        If B<memdump> is set, then the virtual machine will dump its RAM
       into a file, whose name is given by the B<memdumpfile> option,
       at the end of the simulation run.  The default value is FALSE.

       memdumpfile (type: string)

        This is the name of the file to which a RAM dump will be
       written at the end of the simulation run.  The default value is "memdump.bin".

       reportirq (type: Boolean)

        If B<reportirq> is set, then any change in the interrupt
       inputs from a device will be reported on stderr. Also, any
       Interrupt exception will be reported, if B<excmsg> is also
       set.  The default value is FALSE.

       spimconsole (type: Boolean)

        When set, configure the SPIM-compatible console device.
       This is incompatible with B<decserial>.  The default value is TRUE.

       ttydev (type: string)

        This pathname will be used as the device from which reads from the
       SPIM-compatible console device's Keyboard 1 will take their data, and
       to which writes to Display 1 will send their data. If the OS supports
       ttyname(3), that call will be used to guess the default pathname.
       If the pathname is the single word B<off>, then the device will be
       disconnected.
       If the pathname is the single word B<stdout>, then the device
       will be connected to standard output, and input will be disabled.  The default value is "/dev/tty".

       ttydev2 (type: string)

        See B<ttydev> option; this one is just like it, but pertains
       to Keyboard 2 and Display 2.   The default value is "off".

       debug (type: Boolean)

        If debug is set, then the gdb remote serial protocol backend will
       be enabled in the virtual machine. This will cause the machine to
       wait for gdb to attach and B<continue> before booting the ROM file.
       If debug is not set, then the machine will boot the ROM file
       without pausing.  The default value is FALSE.

       debugport (type: number)

        If debugport is set to something nonzero, then the gdb remote
       serial protocol backend will use the specified TCP port.  The default value is 0.

       realtime (type: Boolean)

        If B<realtime> is set, then the clock device will cause simulated
       time to run at some fraction of real time, determined by the
       B<timeratio> option. If realtime is not set, then simulated time
       will run at the speed given by the B<clockspeed> option.   The default value is FALSE.

       timeratio (type: number)

        If the B<realtime> option is set, this option gives the
       number of times slower than real time at which simulated time will
       run. It has no effect if B<realtime> is not set.  The default value is 1.

       clockspeed (type: number)

        If the B<realtime> option is not set, you should set this
       option to the average speed in MIPS instructions per second at which
       your system runs VMIPS. You can get suitable values from turning
       on the B<instcounts> option and running some of your favorite
       programs. If you increase the value of B<clockspeed>, time will
       appear to pass more slowly for the simulated machine; if you decrease
       it, time will pass more quickly. (To be precise, one instruction is
       assumed to take 1.0e9/B<clockspeed> nanoseconds.) This option
       has no effect if B<realtime> is set.  The default value is 250000.

       clockintr (type: number)

        This option gives the frequency of clock interrupts, in nanoseconds
       of simulated time, for the clock device. It does not affect the
       DECstation-compatible realtime clock.  The default value is 200000000.

       clockdeviceirq (type: number)

        This option gives the interrupt line to which the clock device is
       connected. Values must be a number 2-7 corresponding to an interrupt
       line reserved for use by hardware.  The default value is 7.

       clockdevice (type: Boolean)

        If this option is set, then the clock device is enabled. This will
       allow MIPS programs to take advantage of a high precision clock.  The default value is TRUE.

       dbemsg (type: Boolean)

        If this option is set, then the physical addresses of accesses
       that cause data bus errors (DBE exceptions) will be printed.  The default value is FALSE.

       decrtc (type: Boolean)

        If this option is set, then the DEC RTC device will be
       configured.  The default value is FALSE.

       deccsr (type: Boolean)

        If this option is set, then the DEC CSR (Control/Status Register)
       will be configured.  The default value is FALSE.

       decstat (type: Boolean)

        If this option is set, then the DEC CHKSYN and ERRADR registers
       will be configured.  The default value is FALSE.

       decserial (type: Boolean)

        If this option is set, then the DEC DZ11 serial device
       will be configured. This is incompatible with B<spimconsole>.  The default value is FALSE.

       tracing (type: Boolean)

        If this option is set, VMIPS will keep a trace of the last few
       instructions executed in memory, and write it out when the machine
       halts.  This incurs a substantial performance penalty.  Use the
       B<tracesize> option to set the size of the trace you want.  The default value is FALSE.

       tracesize (type: number)

        Set this option to the maximum number of instructions to keep in the
       dynamic instruction trace. This has no effect if B<tracing> is
       not set.  The default value is 100000.

       bigendian (type: Boolean)

        If this option is set, then the emulated MIPS CPU will be in
       Big-Endian mode.  Otherwise, it will be in Little-Endian mode. You
       must set it to correspond to the type of binaries that your
       assembler and compiler are configured to produce, which is not
       necessarily the same as the endianness of the CPU on which you
       are running VMIPS.  (The default may not be meaningful for your
       setup!)  The default value is FALSE.

       tracestartpc (type: number)

        If the tracing option is set, then this is the PC value which will
       trigger the start of tracing.  Otherwise it has no effect.  The default value is 0.

       traceendpc (type: number)

        If the tracing option is set, then this is the PC value which will
       trigger the end of tracing. Otherwise it has no effect.  The default value is 0.

       mipstoolprefix (type: string)

        vmipstool uses this option to locate your MIPS-targetted cross
       compilation tools, if you have them installed. If your MIPS GCC
       is installed as /opt/mips/bin/mips-elf-gcc, then you should set
       this option to "/opt/mips/bin/mips-elf-". vmipstool looks for
       the "gcc", "ld", "objcopy" and "objdump" programs starting with
       this prefix. This option should be set in your installed
       system-wide VMIPS configuration file (vmipsrc) by the "configure"
       script; the compiled-in default is designed to cause an error.  The default value is "/nonexistent/mips/bin/mipsel-ecoff-".

       execname (type: string)

        Name of executable to be loaded by automatic kernel loader. This
       is an experimental, unfinished feature. The option value
       must be the name of a MIPS ECOFF executable file, or 'none'
       to disable the option.  The executable's headers must specify
       load addresses in KSEG0 or KSEG1 (0x80000000 through
       0xbfffffff).   The default value is "none".

       fpu (type: Boolean)

        True to enable hooks in the CPU to communicate with a
       floating-point unit as coprocessor 1. The floating-point unit
       is not implemented; only the hooks in the CPU are. This is an
       experimental, unfinished feature.  The default value is FALSE.

       testdev (type: Boolean)

        True to enable a memory-mapped device that is used to test
       the memory-mapped device interface. The VMIPS test suite turns
       this device on as necessary; you should not normally need
       to enable it.  The default value is FALSE.
