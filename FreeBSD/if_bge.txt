BGE(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 BGE(4)

NAME
     bge – Broadcom BCM57xx/BCM590x Gigabit/Fast Ethernet driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device miibus
           device bge

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_bge_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The bge driver provides support for various NICs based on the Broadcom
     BCM570x, 571x, 572x, 575x, 576x, 578x, 5776x and 5778x Gigabit Ethernet
     controller chips and the 590x and 5779x Fast Ethernet controller chips.

     All of these NICs are capable of 10, 100 and 1000Mbps speeds over CAT5
     copper cable, except for the SysKonnect SK-9D41 which supports only
     1000Mbps over multimode fiber.  The BCM570x builds upon the technology of
     the Alteon Tigon II.  It has two R4000 CPU cores and is PCI v2.2 and PCI-
     X v1.0 compliant.  It supports IP, TCP and UDP checksum offload for both
     receive and transmit, multiple RX and TX DMA rings for QoS applications,
     rules-based receive filtering, and VLAN tag stripping/insertion as well
     as a 256-bit multicast hash filter.  Additional features may be provided
     via value-add firmware updates.  The BCM570x supports TBI (ten bit
     interface) and GMII transceivers, which means it can be used with either
     copper or 1000baseX fiber applications.  Note however the device only
     supports a single speed in TBI mode.

     Most BCM5700-based cards also use the Broadcom BCM5401 or BCM5411
     10/100/1000 copper gigabit transceivers, which support autonegotiation of
     10, 100 and 1000Mbps modes in full or half duplex.

     The BCM5700, BCM5701, BCM5702, BCM5703, BCM5704, BCM5714, BCM5717,
     BCM5719, BCM5720, BCM5780 and BCM57765 also support jumbo frames, which
     can be configured via the interface MTU setting.  Selecting an MTU larger
     than 1500 bytes with the ifconfig(8) utility configures the adapter to
     receive and transmit jumbo frames.  Using jumbo frames can greatly
     improve performance for certain tasks, such as file transfers and data
     streaming.

     The bge driver supports the following media types:

     autoselect       Enable autoselection of the media type and options.  The
                      user can manually override the autoselected mode by
                      adding media options to rc.conf(5).

     10baseT/UTP      Set 10Mbps operation.  The ifconfig(8) mediaopt option
                      can also be used to select either full-duplex or
                      half-duplex modes.

     100baseTX        Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.  The ifconfig(8)
                      mediaopt option can also be used to select either
                      full-duplex or half-duplex modes.

     1000baseTX       Set 1000baseTX operation over twisted pair.  Only
                      full-duplex mode is supported.

     1000baseSX       Set 1000Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) operation.  Both
                      full-duplex and half-duplex modes are supported.

     The bge driver supports the following media options:

     full-duplex      Force full duplex operation.

     half-duplex      Force half duplex operation.

     For more information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

LOADER TUNABLES
     The following tunables can be set at the loader(8) prompt before booting
     the kernel, or stored in loader.conf(5).

     hw.bge.allow_asf
             Allow the ASF feature for cooperating with IPMI.  Can cause
             system lockup problems on a small number of systems.  Enabled by
             default.

     dev.bge.%d.msi
             Non-zero value enables MSI support on the Ethernet hardware.  The
             default value is 1.

SYSCTL VARIABLES
     The following variables are available as both sysctl(8) variables and
     loader(8) tunables:

     dev.bge.%d.forced_collapse
             Allow collapsing multiple transmit buffers into a single buffer
             to increase transmit performance with the cost of CPU cycles.
             The default value is 0 to disable transmit buffer collapsing.

     dev.bge.%d.forced_udpcsum
             Enable UDP transmit checksum offloading even if controller can
             generate UDP datagrams with checksum value 0.  UDP datagrams with
             checksum value 0 can confuse receiver host as it means sender did
             not compute UDP checksum.  The default value is 0 which disables
             UDP transmit checksum offloading.  The interface need to be
             brought down and up again before a change takes effect.

DIAGNOSTICS
     bge%d: couldn't map memory  A fatal initialization error has occurred.

     bge%d: couldn't map ports  A fatal initialization error has occurred.

     bge%d: couldn't map interrupt  A fatal initialization error has occurred.

     bge%d: no memory for softc struct!  The driver failed to allocate memory
     for per-device instance information during initialization.

     bge%d: failed to enable memory mapping!  The driver failed to initialize
     PCI shared memory mapping.  This might happen if the card is not in a
     bus-master slot.

     bge%d: firmware handshake timed out, found 0xffffffff  The device was
     physically disconnected from the system, or there is a problem with the
     device causing it to stop responding to the host it is attached to.

     bge%d: no memory for jumbo buffers!  The driver failed to allocate memory
     for jumbo frames during initialization.

     bge%d: watchdog timeout  The device has stopped responding to the
     network, or there is a problem with the network connection (cable).

HISTORY
     The bge device driver first appeared in FreeBSD 4.5.

AUTHORS
     The bge driver was written by Bill Paul <wpaul@windriver.com>.

BUGS
     Hotplug is not currently supported in FreeBSD, hence, Thunderbolt
     interfaces need to be connected prior to system power up on Apple systems
     in order for the interface to be detected.  Also, due to the lack of
     hotplug support, Thunderbolt-based interfaces must not be removed while
     the system is up as the kernel is currently unable to cope with a bge
     interface disappearing.
