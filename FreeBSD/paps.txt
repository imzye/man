PAPS(1)                 FreeBSD General Commands Manual                PAPS(1)

NAME
       paps - text to PostScript converter using Pango


SYNOPSIS
       paps [options] files...


DESCRIPTION
       paps reads an input file and writes a PostScript language or user
       specified format rendering of the file to standard output. paps accepts
       international text in any locale and provides internationalized text
       layout including text shaping and bidirectional text rendering.

       If no filename argument is provided, paps reads the standard input. If
       the standard input is a terminal, input is terminated by an EOF signal,
       usually Control-d.


OPTIONS
       paps follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options
       starting with two dashes (`-'). A summary of options is included below.

       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

       --landscape
              Landscape output. Default is portrait.

       --columns=cl
              Format output into cl columns. Default is 1.
              Please notice this option isn't related to the terminal length
              as in a "80 columns terminal".

       --font=desc
              Use font based on description desc. Default is "Monospace 12".
              The format of the string representation is:

              "[family-list] [style-options] [size]"

              where family-list is a comma separated list of families
              optionally terminated by a comma, style-options is a whitespace
              separated list of words where each word describes one of style,
              variant, weight, or stretch, and size is a decimal number for
              size in points, e.g. "Courier,Monospace Bold Italic 10".

       -o, --output=file
              Output file. Default is stdout. Output format is set based on
              file's extension when --format is not provided.

       --rtl  Do right-to-left (RTL) text layout and align text to the right.
              Text direction is detected automatically. Use this option for
              explicit RTL layout and right alignment.

       --justify
              Justify the layout. Stretch complete lines to fill the entire
              width.

       --wrap=wm
              Use line wrapping mode wm. Default is word-char.


              word
                         Wrap lines at word boundaries


              char
                         Wrap lines at character boundaries


              word-char
                         Wrap lines at word boundaries, but fall back to
                         character boundaries if there is not enough space for
                         a full word

       --show-wrap
              Mark wrapped lines with special characters.

       --paper=ps
              Choose paper size. Accepted paper sizes are 'legal', 'letter',
              'A3' and 'A4'.  Default is A4.

       --gravity=gr
              Set base glyph orientation. Default is auto.


              south
                         Glyphs stand upright


              east
                         Glyphs are rotated 90 degrees clockwise


              north
                         Glyphs are upside-down


              west
                         Glyphs are rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise


              auto
                         Gravity is resolved from the context


       --gravity-hint=gh
              Set how horizontal scripts behave in a vertical context. Default
              is natural.


              natural
                         Scripts will take their natural gravity based on the
                         base gravity and the script


              strong
                         Always use the base gravity, regardless of the script


              line
                         For scripts not in their natural direction (e.g.
                         Latin in East gravity), choose per-script gravity
                         such that every script respects the line progression.
                         This means, Latin and Arabic will take opposite
                         gravities and both flow top-to-bottom for example.

       --format=fmt
              Choose output format. Default is ps.


              ps
                         PostScript


              pdf
                         Portable Document Format


              svg
                         Scalable Vector Graphics

       Postscript points
              Each postscript point equals to 1/72 of an inch. 36 points are
              1/2 of an inch.

       --bottom-margin=bm
              Set bottom margin. Default is 36 postscript points.

       --top-margin=tm
              Set top margin. Default is 36 postscript points.

       --left-margin=lm
              Set left margin. Default is 36 postscript points.

       --right-margin=rm
              Set right margin. Default is 36 postscript points.

       --gutter-width=gw
              Set gutter width. Default is 40 postscript points.

       --header
              Draw page header with document name, date and page number for
              each page. Header is not printed by default.

       --header-left=fmt
              Sets the formatting for the left side of the header. See FORMAT
              for an explanation of the header and footer formatting. Default
              is the current localized date.

       --header-center=fmt
              Sets the formatting for the center of the header. See FORMAT for
              an explanation of the header and footer formatting. Default is
              the filename.

       --header-right=fmt
              Sets the formatting for the center of the header. See FORMAT for
              an explanation of the header and footer formatting. Default is
              the Page number.

       --footer
              Draw page footer with document name, date and page number for
              each page. Footer is not printed by default.

       --footer-left=fmt
              Sets the formatting for the left side of the footer. See FORMAT
              for an explanation of the footer and footer formatting. The
              default formatting is an empty string.

       --footer-center=fmt
              Sets the formatting for the center of the footer. See FORMAT for
              an explanation of the footer and footer formatting. The default
              formatting is an empty string.

       --footer-right=fmt
              Sets the formatting for the center of the footer. See FORMAT for
              an explanation of the footer and footer formatting. The default
              formatting is an empty string.

       --title="text"
              Use text as the title string for page header. By default the
              input filename or "stdin" is used.

       --markup
              Interpret input as pango markup. Pango Text Attribute Markup
              Language allows marking parts of the text with tags defining
              additional attributes such as font face, size, weight, colors or
              text decoration such as underline or strikethrough.

       --encoding=enc
              Assume encoding of the input text is enc. By default the
              encoding of the current locale is used (e.g. UTF-8).

       --lpi=lines
              Set number of lines per inch. This determines the line spacing.

       --cpi=chars
              Set number of characters per inch. This is an alternative method
              of specifying the font size.

       --g-fatal-warnings
              Make all glib warnings fatal.


EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values are returned:

       0
             Successful completion.

       1
             An error occurred.


HEADER AND FOOTER FORMATTING
       The header and footers may be formatted by a mini language based on the
       python f-strings. Text outside of squiggly brackets are entered
       literally in the output. Text inside squiggly brackets contain one of
       the following predefined list of variables:



              now
                         The current time


              mtime
                         The modification time of the file being printed


              page_idx
                         The page index of the page


              num_pages
                         The total number of pages in the document


              filename
                         The filename (basename) of the document


              path
                         The full path of the document


EXAMPLES
       Example 1 Printing UTF-8 text file

       The following command can be used to print a file in any of the UTF-8
       based locales if the file is in UTF-8 or compatible codeset.

         $ paps en_US_UTF-8.txt

       By default paps will print PostScript rendering to standard output.
       Send the output to a printer using lp

         $ paps en_US_UTF-8.txt | lp

       or to a file using redirection or the -o option

         $ paps en_US_UTF-8.txt > out.ps
         $ paps -o out.ps en_US_UTF-8.txt




       Example 2 Specify encoding

       To print a file in specific encoding regardless of the current locale
       setting use the --encoding option. An example for Japanese EUC encoded
       input file:

         $ paps --encoding eucjp ja_JP_eucjp.txt > out.ps

       paps will still use current locale setting to prioritize the available
       fonts for current language.


       Example 3 Specify locale

       Override the LC_ALL environment variable to run paps in a different
       locale.

         $ LC_ALL=ja_JP.eucjp paps ja_JP_eucjp.txt > out.ps

       Here paps will assume the input is in Japanese EUC encoding and will
       use Japanese eucjp locale to render the output. If --header is added,
       the date is printed in Japanese.


       Example 4 Change the header and footer

       Override the header and the footer to show only the page in the middle
       of the footer.

         $ paps --separation-lines -o /tmp/foo.pdf --header --header-left='' \
          --header-center='{path}' --header-right='' --footer \
          --footer-left='Printed {now:%c}' \
          --footer-right='Page {page_idx}/{num_pages}' \
          `pwd`/paps.ccx

       Here paps will assume the input is in Japanese EUC encoding and will
       use Japanese eucjp locale to render the output. If --header is added,
       the date is printed in Japanese.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       paps uses locale environment variables to determine its behavior. The
       following categories are used:

       LC_CTYPE
                       to assume the encoding of the input. This can be
                       overridden by --encoding.

       LC_TIME
                       to format the date for header.

       Font selection is also affected by current locale. Example 3 describes
       how to run paps in a different locale.
