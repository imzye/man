CONFIG_STATUS_DEMO(1)                      User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       config_status_demo.pl - demonstrate using Nagios::Config and
       Nagios::StatusLog together.

USAGE
       perl config_status_demo.pl -c /etc/opt/nagios/nagios.cfg -l
       /var/opt/nagios/status.log

NOTES
       Please send the benchmark outputs to duncs@cpan.org so I can see how
       the performance is on boxes and configs other than my own.

       This setup is very sensitive to mistmatches between the configuration
       and the status log.
