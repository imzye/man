NAME
       File::PathConvert - DEPRECATED: USE File::Spec and Cwd::abs_path().

SYNOPSIS
           *** THIS MODULE (File::PathConvert) IS DEPRECATED. ****

           There are several known bugs, and it is not being actively
           maintained since all functionality is now available in
           modules (Cwd.pm and File::Spec) bundled in every Perl
           distribution of recent vintage.  This version is provided to
           fix a few bugs and to get the word out about the
           deprecation.

           Please use Cwd::abs_path() instead of
           File::PathConvert::realpath() and File::Spec methods instead
           of all other path manipulation functions in this module.

           If you use setfstype, you probably want to access a File::Spec::Foo
           module for the appropriate operating system.

           There is also a version of File::Spec on CPAN for backwards
           compatability.

           Thank you,

BUGS
       "realpath" is not fully multiplatform.

       "abs2rel" is broken in MacOS mode.

LIMITATIONS
       •   In URLs, paths not ending in '/' are split such that the last name
           in the path is a filename.  This is not intuitive: many people use
           such URLs for directories, and most servers send a redirect.  This
           may cause programers using this package to code in bugs, it may be
           more pragmatic to always assume all names are directory names.
           (Note that the query portion is always part of the filename).

       •   If the relative and base paths are on different volumes, no error
           is returned.  A silent, hopefully reasonable assumption is made.

       •   No detection of unix style paths is done when other filesystems are
           selected, like File::Basename does.
