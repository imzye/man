NAME
     snmp_target – Target addresses and notifications module for bsnmpd(1)

LIBRARY
     (begemotSnmpdModulePath."target" = /usr/lib/snmp_target.so)

DESCRIPTION
     The snmp_target module implements SNMPv3 Management Target MIB and basic
     functionality from Notification MIB as defined in RFC 3413. The module is
     used to manage the internal list of SNMPv3 notification target addresses
     in bsnmpd and their associated transport and encapsulation parameters.
     The module must be loaded for bsnmpd to send SNMPv3 Trap-PDUs to the
     configured notification target addresses.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
     A short description of the objects implemented in the module follows.

     snmpTargetSpinLock
                An advisory lock used to coordinate several Command Generator
                Applications when altering the SNMP Target addresses and their
                associated parameters.

     snmpTargetAddrTable
                The table contains the transport addresses to be used in
                generation of SNMP messages.  The table contains the following
                objects

                snmpTargetAddrName         A unique local identifier used as
                                           entry key. Not accessible for GET
                                           or SET operations.

                snmpTargetAddrTDomain      The transport domain of the target
                                           address. Currently only UDP over
                                           IPv4 is supported and any attempt
                                           to SET the value of this object
                                           will return an "inconsistentValue"
                                           error. Additional transport domains
                                           will be supported in future via the
                                           object definitions in TRANSPORT-
                                           ADDRESS-MIB (RFC 3419).

                snmpTargetAddrTAddress     The transport address of this entry
                                           interpreted within the context of
                                           the value of snmpTargetAddrTDomain.
                                           For UDP over IPv4, this is a 6-byte
                                           long octetstring, with the first 4
                                           bytes representing the IPv4 address
                                           and the last 2 bytes the UDP port
                                           number in network-byte order.

                snmpTargetAddrTimeout      The value of this object is only
                                           relevant when the receiver of the
                                           SNMP message is to send an
                                           acknowledgment that the message was
                                           received, i.e for SNMP
                                           notifications it is relevant if the
                                           notification is SNMP Inform rather
                                           than SNMP Trap. Currently bsnmpd
                                           supports only SNMP Trap
                                           notifications, so the value of this
                                           object is meaningless.

                snmpTargetAddrRetryCount   As with snmpTargetAddrTimeout the
                                           value of this object currently is
                                           meaningless.

                snmpTargetAddrTagList      A list of human-readable tag values
                                           used to select target addresses for
                                           a particular operation. Recognized
                                           ASCII delimiting characters between
                                           tags are space (0x20), tab (0x20),
                                           carriage return (0xOD) and line
                                           feed (0x0A).

                snmpTargetAddrParams       The value of this object contains
                                           the value of a key in
                                           snmpTargetParamsTable containing
                                           SNMP parameters used when
                                           generating messages to this
                                           transport address.

                snmpTargetAddrStorageType  This column always has either of
                                           two values. Entries created via
                                           bsnmpd's configuration file always
                                           have this column set to readOnly
                                           (5) and it is not possible to
                                           modify those entries. Entries
                                           created by Command Generator
                                           Applications always have this
                                           column set to volatile(2) and such
                                           entries are lost when the module is
                                           restarted. A SET operation on this
                                           column is not allowed.

                snmpTargetAddrRowStatus    This column is used to create new
                                           target address entries or delete
                                           existing ones from the table.

     snmpTargetParamsTable
                The table contains the target information to be used in
                generation of SNMP messages.  The table contains the following
                objects

                snmpTargetParamsName         A unique local identifier used as
                                             entry key. Not accessible for GET
                                             or SET operations.

                snmpTargetParamsMPModel      The Message Processing Model to
                                             be used when generating SNMP PDUs
                                             using this entry. Supported
                                             values are 0 for SNMPv1, 1 for
                                             SNMPv2c and 3 for SNMPv3.

                snmpTargetParamsSecurityModel
                                             The Security Model to be used
                                             when generating SNMP PDUs using
                                             this entry.  Supported values are
                                             1  for SNMPv1, 2 for SNMPv2c and
                                             3 for SNMPv3 User-Based Security
                                             Model.

                snmpTargetParamsSecurityName
                                             The securityName which identifies
                                             the Principal on whose behalf
                                             SNMP PDUs will be generated using
                                             this entry. For SNMPv1 and
                                             SNMPv2c this is the name of a
                                             community configured in bsnmpd,
                                             and for SNMPv3 USM, this is the
                                             name of an existing user
                                             configured via the snmp_usm
                                             module.

                snmpTargetParamsSecurityLevel
                                             The Security Level to be used
                                             when generating SNMP PDUs using
                                             this entry.  Supported values are
                                             noAuthNoPriv(1) for plain-text
                                             PDUs with no authentication,
                                             authNoPriv(2) for authenticated
                                             plain-text PDUs and authPriv(3)
                                             for encrypted PDUs.

                snmpTargetParamsStorageType  As with snmpTargetAddrStorageType
                                             this column always has either of
                                             two values. Entries created via
                                             bsnmpd's configuration file
                                             always have this column set to
                                             readOnly (5), while entries
                                             created by Command Generator
                                             Applications always have this
                                             column set to volatile(2). A SET
                                             operation on this column is not
                                             allowed.

                snmpTargetParamsRowStatus    This column is used to create new
                                             target address parameters entries
                                             or delete existing ones from the
                                             table.

     snmpNotifyTable
                The table is used to select the management targets which
                should receive SNMP notifications.  The table contains the
                following objects

                snmpNotifyName         A unique local identifier used as entry
                                       key. Not accessible for GET or SET
                                       operations.

                snmpNotifyTag          This object contains a single tag value
                                       used to select target addresses from
                                       the snmpTargetAddrTable to which the
                                       notifications will be send.

                snmpNotifyType         The type of SNMP notifications that
                                       will be send to the target addresses
                                       matching the corresponding
                                       snmpNotifyTag.  Possible values are
                                       Trap (1) or Inform (2). Currently only
                                       SNMP Traps are supported and any
                                       attempt to SET the value of this object
                                       will return an "inconsistentValue"
                                       error.

                snmpNotifyStorageType  Again this column always has either of
                                       two values. Entries created via
                                       bsnmpd's configuration file always have
                                       this column set to readOnly (5), while
                                       entries created by Command Generator
                                       Applications always have this column
                                       set to volatile(2). A SET operation on
                                       this column is not allowed.

                snmpNotifyRowStatus    This column is used to create new
                                       notification target entries or delete
                                       existing ones from the table.

     The snmpNotifyFilterProfileTable and snmpNotifyFilterTable tables from
     the SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB are not supported by the module.  Notification
     filtering is supported via the snmp_vacm(3) module instead.
