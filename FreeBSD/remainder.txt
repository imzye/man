REMAINDER(3)           FreeBSD Library Functions Manual           REMAINDER(3)

NAME
     remainder, remainderf, remainderl, remquo, remquof, remquol – minimal
     residue functions

LIBRARY
     Math Library (libm, -lm)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <math.h>

     double
     remainder(double x, double y);

     float
     remainderf(float x, float y);

     long double
     remainderl(long double x, long double y);

     double
     remquo(double x, double y, int *quo);

     float
     remquof(float x, float y, int *quo);

     long double
     remquol(long double x, long double y, int *quo);

DESCRIPTION
     remainder(), remainderf(), remainderl(), remquo(), remquof(), and
     remquol() return the remainder r := x - n∗y where n is the integer
     nearest the exact value of x/y; moreover if |n - x/y| = 1/2 then n is
     even.  Consequently the remainder is computed exactly and |r| ≤ |y|/2.
     But attempting to take the remainder when y is 0 or x is ±infinity is an
     invalid operation that produces a NaN.

     The remquo(), remquof(), and remquol() functions also store the last k
     bits of n in the location pointed to by quo, provided that n exists.  The
     number of bits k is platform-specific, but is guaranteed to be at least
     3.

STANDARDS
     The remainder(), remainderf(), remainderl(), remquo(), remquof(), and
     remquol() routines conform to ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (“ISO C99”).  The
     remainder is as defined in IEEE Std 754-1985.

HISTORY
     The remainder() and remainderf() functions appeared in 4.3BSD and
     FreeBSD 2.0, respectively.  The remquo() and remquof() functions were
     added in FreeBSD 6.0, and remainderl() and remquol() were added in
     FreeBSD 8.0.
