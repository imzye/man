Text::MultiMarkdown::ApacheHandler(3)      User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Text::MultiMarkdown::ApacheHandler - Processes files with MultiMarkdown
       syntax for Apache

VERSION
       Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
       Processes files containing MultiMarkdown syntax into HTML files and
       serves them, optionally applying CSS styles according to rules in your
       httpd.conf or (more likely) .htaccess files. Optionally applies
       SmartyPants post-processing using Text::Typography.

       You might put some lines like this in your ".htaccess" or "httpd.conf"
       file:

               AddType text/multimarkdown .markdown .mkd .mhtml
               <Files ~ "\.(markdown|mkd|mhtml)$">
                       SetHandler perl-script
                       PerlHandler Text::MultiMarkdown::ApacheHandler
                       PerlSetVar mm_useSmartyPants 1
               </Files>

TODO
       Tests. I haven't yet looked into how to do tests for an Apache module
       like this; I want to do them more for the experience than the
       necessity, since there is practically nothing in this module.
