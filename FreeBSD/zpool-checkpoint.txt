ZPOOL-CHECKPOINT(8)     FreeBSD System Manager's Manual    ZPOOL-CHECKPOINT(8)

NAME
     zpool-checkpoint – check-point current ZFS storage pool state

SYNOPSIS
     zpool checkpoint [-d [-w]] pool

DESCRIPTION
     Checkpoints the current state of pool , which can be later restored by
     zpool import --rewind-to-checkpoint.  The existence of a checkpoint in a
     pool prohibits the following zpool subcommands: remove, attach, detach,
     split, and reguid.  In addition, it may break reservation boundaries if
     the pool lacks free space.  The zpool status command indicates the
     existence of a checkpoint or the progress of discarding a checkpoint from
     a pool.  zpool list can be used to check how much space the checkpoint
     takes from the pool.

OPTIONS
     -d, --discard
             Discards an existing checkpoint from pool.

     -w, --wait
             Waits until the checkpoint has finished being discarded before
             returning.
