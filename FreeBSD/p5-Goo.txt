DESCRIPTION
       "The Goo" helps you stick "Things" together in your working
       environment.

       Things include Perl modules, Perl scripts, log files, javascripts,
       configuration files, database tables, templates etc.

       The Goo records a "Trail" as you jump quickly from Thing to Thing in a
       simple, text-based console. It remembers how you associate Things in
       your environment.

       Accelerate your work by quickly traversing the Trail of associations
       between Things.

METHODS
       check_environment
           Check and set up the environment.

       do_action
           Take a command line switch (e.g., -p) and map it to an action
           handler (e.g., [P]rofile) and perform the action on the Thing.
