DESCRIPTION
       The ugrep utility searches any given input files, selecting files and
       lines that match one or more patterns specified as regular expressions
       or as fixed strings.  A pattern matches multiple input lines when the
       pattern's regular expression matches one or more newlines.  An empty
       pattern matches every line.  Each input line that matches at least one
       of the patterns is written to the standard output.

       The ug command is intended for interactive searching, using a `.ugrep'
       configuration file located in the working directory or, if not found,
       in the home directory, see CONFIGURATION.  ug is equivalent to ugrep
       --config --pretty --sort to load a configuration file, enhance the
       terminal output, and to sort files by name.

       The ugrep+ and ug+ commands are the same as the ugrep and ug commands,
       but also use filters to search pdfs, documents, e-books, and image
       metadata, when the corresponding filter tools are installed.

       A list of matching files is produced with option -l (--files-with-
       matches).  Option -c (--count) counts the number of matching lines.
       When combined with option -o, counts the total number of matches.  When
       combined with option -m1, (--min-count=1), skips files with zero
       matches.

       The default pattern syntax is an extended form of the POSIX ERE syntax,
       same as option -E (--extended-regexp).  Try ug --help regex for help
       with pattern syntax and how to use logical connectives to specify
       Boolean search queries with option -% (--bool) to match lines and -%%
       (--bool --files) to match files.  Options -F (--fixed-strings), -G
       (--basic-regexp) and -P (--perl-regexp) specify other pattern syntaxes.

       Option -i (--ignore-case) ignores letter case in patterns.  Option -j
       (--smart-case) enables -i only if the search patterns are specified in
       lower case.

       Fuzzy (approximate) search is specified with option -Z (--fuzzy) with
       an optional argument to control character insertions, deletions, and/or
       substitutions.  Try ug --help fuzzy for help with fuzzy search.

       Note that pattern `.' matches any non-newline character.  Pattern `\n'
       matches a newline character.  Multiple lines may be matched with
       patterns that match one or more newline characters.

       The empty pattern "" matches all lines.  Other empty-matching patterns
       do not.  For example, the pattern `a*' will match one or more a's.
       Option -Y forces empty matches for compatibility with other grep tools.

       Option -f FILE matches patterns specified in FILE.

       By default Unicode patterns are matched.  Option -U (--ascii or
       --binary) disables Unicode matching for ASCII and binary pattern
       matching.  Non-Unicode matching is more efficient.

       ugrep accepts input of various encoding formats and normalizes the
       output to UTF-8.  When a UTF byte order mark is present in the input,
       the input is automatically normalized.  An input encoding format may be
       specified with option --encoding.

       If no FILE arguments are specified and standard input is read from a
       terminal, recursive searches are performed as if -r is specified.  To
       force reading from standard input, specify `-' as a FILE argument.

       Directories specified as FILE arguments are searched without recursing
       deeper into subdirectories, unless -R, -r, or -2...-9 is specified to
       search subdirectories recursively (up to the specified depth.)

       Option -I (--ignore-binary) ignores binary files.  A binary file is a
       file with non-text content.  A file with zero bytes or invalid UTF
       formatting is considered binary.

       Hidden files and directories are ignored in recursive searches.  Option
       -. (--hidden) includes hidden files and directories in recursive
       searches.

       To match the names of files to search and the names of directories to
       recurse, one or more of the following options may be specified.  Option
       -O specifies one or more filename extensions to match.  Option -t
       specifies one or more file types to search (-t list outputs a list of
       types.)  Option -g specifies a gitignore-style glob pattern to match
       filenames.  Option --ignore-files specifies a file with gitignore-style
       globs to ignore directories and files.  Try ug --help globs for help
       with filename and directory name matching.  See also section GLOBBING.

       Compressed files and archives are searched with option -z
       (--decompress).  When used with option --zmax=NUM, searches the
       contents of compressed files and archives stored within archives up to
       NUM levels.

       Output to a terminal for viewing is enhanced with --pretty, which is
       enabled by default with the ug command.

       A query terminal user interface (TUI) is opened with -Q (--query) to
       interactively specify search patterns and view search results.  A
       PATTERN argument requires -e PATTERN to start the query TUI with the
       specified pattern.

       A terminal output pager is enabled with --pager that accepts an
       optional COMMAND to view the output.

       Customized output is produced with option --format or --replace.  Try
       ug --help format for help with custom formatting of the output.  See
       also section FORMAT.  Predefined formats include CSV with option --csv,
       JSON with option --json, and XML with option --xml.  Hexdumps are
       output with option -X (--hex) or with option --hexdump to customize
       hexdumps.

       A `--' signals the end of options; the rest of the parameters are FILE
       arguments, allowing filenames to begin with a `-' character.

       Long options may start with `--no-' to disable, when applicable.

       ug --help WHAT displays help on options related to WHAT.

       The following options are available:

       -A NUM, --after-context=NUM
              Output NUM lines of trailing context after matching lines.
              Places a --group-separator between contiguous groups of matches.
              If -o is specified, output the match with context to fit NUM
              columns after the match or shortens the match.  See also options
              -B, -C and -y.

       -a, --text
              Process a binary file as if it were text.  This is equivalent to
              the --binary-files=text option.  This option might output binary
              garbage to the terminal, which can have problematic consequences
              if the terminal driver interprets some of it as terminal
              commands.

       --all, -@
              Search all files except hidden: cancel previous file and
              directory search restrictions and cancel --ignore-binary and
              --ignore-files when specified.  Restrictions specified after
              this option, i.e. to the right, are still applied.  For example,
              -@I searches all non-binary files and -@. searches all files
              including hidden files.  Note that hidden files and directories
              are never searched, unless option -. or --hidden is specified.

       --and [-e] PATTERN
              Specify additional PATTERN that must match.  Additional -e
              PATTERN following this option is considered an alternative
              pattern to match, i.e. each -e is interpreted as an OR pattern
              enclosed within the AND.  For example, -e A -e B --and -e C -e D
              matches lines with (`A' or `B') and (`C' or `D').  Note that
              multiple -e PATTERN are alternations that bind more tightly
              together than --and.  Option --stats displays the search
              patterns applied.  See also options --not, --andnot, --bool,
              --files and --lines.

       --andnot [-e] PATTERN
              Combines --and --not.  See also options --and, --not and --bool.

       -B NUM, --before-context=NUM
              Output NUM lines of leading context before matching lines.
              Places a --group-separator between contiguous groups of matches.
              If -o is specified, output the match with context to fit NUM
              columns before the match or shortens the match.  See also
              options -A, -C and -y.

       -b, --byte-offset
              The offset in bytes of a pattern match is displayed in front of
              the respective matched line.  When -u or --ungroup is specified,
              displays the offset for each pattern matched on the same line.
              Byte offsets are exact for ASCII, UTF-8 and raw binary input.
              Otherwise, the offset in the UTF-8-normalized input is
              displayed.

       --binary-files=TYPE
              Controls searching and reporting pattern matches in binary
              files.  TYPE can be `binary', `without-match`, `text`, `hex` and
              `with-hex'.  The default is `binary' to search binary files and
              to report a match without displaying the match.  `without-match'
              ignores binary matches.  `text' treats all binary files as text,
              which might output binary garbage to the terminal, which can
              have problematic consequences if the terminal driver interprets
              some of it as commands.  `hex' reports all matches in
              hexadecimal.  `with-hex' only reports binary matches in
              hexadecimal, leaving text matches alone.  Files having NUL
              (zero) bytes are binary and files with invalid UTF encoding are
              binary unless option -U or --ascii or --binary is specified.
              Short options are -a, -I, -W, -X.

       --bool, -%, -%%
              Specifies Boolean query patterns.  A Boolean query pattern is
              composed of `AND', `OR', `NOT' operators and grouping with `('
              `)'.  Spacing between subpatterns is the same as `AND', `|' is
              the same as `OR' and a `-' is the same as `NOT'.  The `OR'
              operator binds more tightly than `AND'.  For example, --bool
              'A|B C|D' matches lines with (`A' or `B') and (`C' or `D'),
              --bool 'A -B' matches lines with `A' and not `B'.  Operators
              `AND', `OR', `NOT' require proper spacing.  For example, --bool
              'A OR B AND C OR D' matches lines with (`A' or `B') and (`C' or
              `D'), --bool 'A AND NOT B' matches lines with `A' without `B'.
              Quoted subpatterns are matched literally as strings.  For
              example, --bool 'A "AND"|"OR"' matches lines with `A' and also
              either `AND' or `OR'.  Parentheses are used for grouping.  For
              example, --bool '(A B)|C' matches lines with `A' and `B', or
              lines with `C'.  Note that all subpatterns in a Boolean query
              pattern are regular expressions, unless -F is specified.
              Options -E, -F, -G, -P and -Z can be combined with --bool to
              match subpatterns as strings or regular expressions (-E is the
              default.)  This option does not apply to -f FILE patterns.  The
              double short option -%% enables options --bool --files.  Option
              --stats displays the Boolean search patterns applied.  See also
              options --and, --andnot, --not, --files and --lines.

       --break
              Adds a line break between results from different files.  This
              option is enabled by --heading.

       -C NUM, --context=NUM
              Output NUM lines of leading and trailing context surrounding
              each matching line.  Places a --group-separator between
              contiguous groups of matches.  If -o is specified, output the
              match with context to fit NUM columns before and after the match
              or shortens the match.  See also options -A, -B and -y.

       -c, --count
              Only a count of selected lines is written to standard output.
              When -o or -u is specified, counts the number of patterns
              matched.  When -v is specified, counts the number of
              non-matching lines.  When -m1, (with a comma or --min-count=1)
              is specified, counts only matching files without outputting zero
              matches.

       --color[=WHEN], --colour[=WHEN]
              Mark up the matching text with the colors specified with option
              --colors or the GREP_COLOR or GREP_COLORS environment variable.
              WHEN can be `never', `always', or `auto', where `auto' marks up
              matches only when output on a terminal.  The default is `auto'.

       --colors=COLORS, --colours=COLORS
              Use COLORS to mark up text.  COLORS is a colon-separated list of
              one or more parameters `sl=' (selected line), `cx=' (context
              line), `mt=' (matched text), `ms=' (match selected), `mc='
              (match context), `fn=' (file name), `ln=' (line number), `cn='
              (column number), `bn=' (byte offset), `se=' (separator), `qp='
              (TUI prompt), `qe=' (TUI errors), `qr=' (TUI regex), `qm=' (TUI
              regex meta characters), `ql=' (TUI regex lists and literals),
              `qb=' (TUI regex braces).  Parameter values are ANSI SGR color
              codes or `k' (black), `r' (red), `g' (green), `y' (yellow), `b'
              (blue), `m' (magenta), `c' (cyan), `w' (white), or leave empty
              for no color.  Upper case specifies background colors.  A `+'
              qualifies a color as bright.  A foreground and a background
              color may be combined with font properties `n' (normal), `f'
              (faint), `h' (highlight), `i' (invert), `u' (underline).
              Parameter `hl' enables file name hyperlinks.  Parameter `rv'
              reverses the `sl=' and `cx=' parameters when option -v is
              specified.  Selectively overrides GREP_COLORS.  Legacy grep
              single parameter codes may be specified, for example
              --colors='7;32' or --colors=ig to set ms (match selected).

       --config[=FILE], ---[FILE]
              Use configuration FILE.  The default FILE is `.ugrep'.  The
              working directory is checked first for FILE, then the home
              directory.  The options specified in the configuration FILE are
              parsed first, followed by the remaining options specified on the
              command line.  The ug command automatically loads a `.ugrep'
              configuration file when present, unless --config=FILE or
              --no-config is specified.

       --no-config
              Do not automatically load the default .ugrep configuration file.

       --no-confirm
              Do not confirm actions in -Q query TUI.  The default is confirm.

       --cpp  Output file matches in C++.  See also options --format and -u.

       --csv  Output file matches in CSV.  When -H, -n, -k, or -b is
              specified, additional values are output.  See also options
              --format and -u.

       -D ACTION, --devices=ACTION
              If an input file is a device, FIFO or socket, use ACTION to
              process it.  By default, ACTION is `skip', which means that
              devices are silently skipped.  When ACTION is `read', devices
              read just as if they were ordinary files.

       -d ACTION, --directories=ACTION
              If an input file is a directory, use ACTION to process it.  By
              default, ACTION is `skip', i.e., silently skip directories
              unless specified on the command line.  When ACTION is `read',
              warn when directories are read as input.  When ACTION is
              `recurse', read all files under each directory, recursively,
              following symbolic links only if they are on the command line.
              This is equivalent to the -r option.  When ACTION is
              `dereference-recurse', read all files under each directory,
              recursively, following symbolic links.  This is equivalent to
              the -R option.

       --delay=DELAY
              Set the default -Q key response delay.  Default is 3 for 300ms.

       --depth=[MIN,][MAX], -1, -2, -3, ... -9, -10, -11, ...
              Restrict recursive searches from MIN to MAX directory levels
              deep, where -1 (--depth=1) searches the specified path without
              recursing into subdirectories.  The short forms -3 -5, -3-5 and
              -3,5 search 3 to 5 levels deep.  Enables -r if -R or -r is not
              specified.

       --dotall
              Dot `.' in regular expressions matches anything, including
              newline.  Note that `.*' matches all input and should not be
              used.

       -E, --extended-regexp
              Interpret patterns as extended regular expressions (EREs). This
              is the default.

       -e PATTERN, --regexp=PATTERN
              Specify a PATTERN to search the input.  An input line is
              selected if it matches any of the specified patterns.  This
              option is useful when multiple -e options are used to specify
              multiple patterns, or when a pattern starts with a dash (`-'),
              or to specify a pattern after option -f or after the FILE
              arguments.

       --encoding=ENCODING
              The encoding format of the input.  The default ENCODING is
              binary or UTF-8 which are treated the same.  Therefore,
              --encoding=binary has no effect.  Contrast this with option -U
              or --ascii or --binary that specifies raw binary PATTERN
              matching.  ENCODING can be: `binary', `ASCII', `UTF-8',
              `UTF-16', `UTF-16BE', `UTF-16LE', `UTF-32', `UTF-32BE',
              `UTF-32LE', `LATIN1', `ISO-8859-1', `ISO-8859-2', `ISO-8859-3',
              `ISO-8859-4', `ISO-8859-5', `ISO-8859-6', `ISO-8859-7',
              `ISO-8859-8', `ISO-8859-9', `ISO-8859-10', `ISO-8859-11',
              `ISO-8859-13', `ISO-8859-14', `ISO-8859-15', `ISO-8859-16',
              `MAC', `MACROMAN', `EBCDIC', `CP437', `CP850', `CP858',
              `CP1250', `CP1251', `CP1252', `CP1253', `CP1254', `CP1255',
              `CP1256', `CP1257', `CP1258', `KOI8-R', `KOI8-U', `KOI8-RU',
              `null-data'.

       --exclude=GLOB
              Exclude files whose name matches GLOB, same as -g ^GLOB.  GLOB
              can use **, *, ?, and [...] as wildcards and \ to quote a
              wildcard or backslash character literally.  When GLOB contains a
              `/', full pathnames are matched.  Otherwise basenames are
              matched.  When GLOB ends with a `/', directories are excluded as
              if --exclude-dir is specified.  Otherwise files are excluded.
              Note that --exclude patterns take priority over --include
              patterns.  GLOB should be quoted to prevent shell globbing.
              This option may be repeated.

       --exclude-dir=GLOB
              Exclude directories whose name matches GLOB from recursive
              searches, same as -g ^GLOB/.  GLOB may use **, *, ?, and [...]
              as wildcards and \ to quote a wildcard or backslash character
              literally.  When GLOB contains a `/', full pathnames are
              matched.  Otherwise basenames are matched.  Note that
              --exclude-dir patterns take priority over --include-dir
              patterns.  GLOB should be quoted to prevent shell globbing.
              This option may be repeated.

       --exclude-from=FILE
              Read the globs from FILE and skip files and directories whose
              name matches one or more globs.  A glob may use **, *, ?, and
              [...] as wildcards and \ to quote a wildcard or backslash
              character literally.  When a glob contains a `/', full pathnames
              are matched.  Otherwise basenames are matched.  When a glob ends
              with a `/', directories are excluded as if --exclude-dir is
              specified.  Otherwise files are excluded.  A glob starting with
              a `!' overrides previously-specified exclusions by including
              matching files.  Lines starting with a `#' and empty lines in
              FILE are ignored.  When FILE is a `-', standard input is read.
              This option may be repeated.

       --exclude-fs=MOUNTS
              Exclude file systems specified by MOUNTS from recursive
              searches.  MOUNTS is a comma-separated list of mount points or
              pathnames to directories.  When MOUNTS is not specified, only
              descends into the file systems associated with the specified
              file and directory search targets, i.e. excludes all other file
              systems.  Note that --exclude-fs=MOUNTS take priority over
              --include-fs=MOUNTS.  This option may be repeated.

       -F, --fixed-strings
              Interpret pattern as a set of fixed strings, separated by
              newlines, any of which is to be matched.  This makes ugrep
              behave as fgrep.  If a PATTERN is specified, or -e PATTERN or -N
              PATTERN, then this option has no effect on -f FILE patterns to
              allow -f FILE patterns to narrow or widen the scope of the
              PATTERN search.

       -f FILE, --file=FILE
              Read newline-separated patterns from FILE.  White space in
              patterns is significant.  Empty lines in FILE are ignored.  If
              FILE does not exist, the GREP_PATH environment variable is used
              as path to FILE.  If that fails, looks for FILE in
              /usr/local/share/ugrep/patterns.  When FILE is a `-', standard
              input is read.  Empty files contain no patterns; thus nothing is
              matched.  This option may be repeated.

       --filter=COMMANDS
              Filter files through the specified COMMANDS first before
              searching.  COMMANDS is a comma-separated list of `exts:command
              arguments', where `exts' is a comma-separated list of filename
              extensions and `command' is a filter utility.  Files matching
              one of `exts' are filtered.  A `*' matches any file.  The
              specified `command' may include arguments separated by spaces.
              An argument may be quoted to include spacing, commas or a `%'.
              A `%' argument expands into the pathname to search.  For
              example, --filter='pdf:pdftotext % -' searches PDF files.  The
              `%' expands into a `-' when searching standard input.  When a
              `%' is not specified, the filter command should read from
              standard input and write to standard output.  Option
              --label=.ext may be used to specify extension `ext' when
              searching standard input.  This option may be repeated.

       --filter-magic-label=[+]LABEL:MAGIC
              Associate LABEL with files whose signature "magic bytes" match
              the MAGIC regex pattern.  Only files that have no filename
              extension are labeled, unless +LABEL is specified.  When LABEL
              matches an extension specified in --filter=COMMANDS, the
              corresponding command is invoked.  This option may be repeated.

       --format=FORMAT
              Output FORMAT-formatted matches.  For example
              --format='%f:%n:%O%~' outputs matching lines `%O' with filename
              `%f` and line number `%n' followed by a newline `%~'.  If -P is
              specified, FORMAT may include `%1' to `%9', `%[NUM]#' and
              `%[NAME]#' to output group captures.  A `%%' outputs `%'.  See
              `ugrep --help format' and `man ugrep' section FORMAT for
              details.  When option -o is specified, option -u is also
              enabled.  Context options -A, -B, -C and -y are ignored.

       --free-space
              Spacing (blanks and tabs) in regular expressions are ignored.

       --from=FILE
              Read additional pathnames of files to search from FILE.  When
              FILE is a `-', standard input is read.  This option is useful
              with `find

       -G, --basic-regexp
              Interpret patterns as basic regular expressions (BREs).

       -g GLOBS, --glob=GLOBS, --iglob=GLOBS
              Only search files whose name matches the specified
              comma-separated list of GLOBS, same as --include='glob' for each
              `glob' in GLOBS.  When a `glob' is preceded by a `!' or a `^',
              skip files whose name matches `glob', same as --exclude='glob'.
              When `glob' contains a `/', full pathnames are matched and
              option -r is enabled to recurse into directories if -d, -r or -R
              is not already specified.  Otherwise basenames are matched.
              When `glob' ends with a `/', directories are matched, same as
              --include-dir='glob' and --exclude-dir='glob'.  A leading `./'
              or just `/' matches the working directory.  Option --iglob=GLOBS
              performs case-insensitive name matching.  This option may be
              repeated and may be combined with options -M, -O and -t.  For
              more details, see `ugrep --help globs' and `man ugrep' section
              GLOBBING for details.

       --glob-ignore-case
              Perform case-insensitive glob matching in general.

       --group-separator[=SEP]
              Use SEP as a group separator for context options -A, -B and -C.
              The default is a double hyphen (`--').

       --no-group-separator
              Removes the group separator line from the output for context
              options -A, -B and -C.

       -H, --with-filename
              Always print the filename with output lines.  This is the
              default when there is more than one file to search.

       -h, --no-filename
              Never print filenames with output lines.  This is the default
              when there is only one file (or only standard input) to search.

       --heading, -+
              Group matches per file.  Adds a heading and a line break between
              results from different files.  This option is enabled by
              --pretty when the output is sent to a terminal.

       --help [WHAT], -? [WHAT]
              Display a help message on options related to WHAT when
              specified.  In addition, `--help regex' displays an overview of
              regular expressions, `--help globs' displays an overview of glob
              syntax and conventions, `--help fuzzy' displays details of fuzzy
              search, and `--help format' displays a list of option
              --format=FORMAT fields.

       --hexdump[=[1-8][a][bch][A[NUM]][B[NUM]][C[NUM]]]
              Output matches in 1 to 8 columns of 8 hexadecimal octets.  The
              default is 2 columns or 16 octets per line.  Argument `a'
              outputs a `*' for all hex lines that are identical to the
              previous hex line, `b' removes all space breaks, `c' removes the
              character column, `h' removes hex spacing, `A' includes up to
              NUM hex lines after a match, `B' includes up to NUM hex lines
              before a match and `C' includes up to NUM hex lines before and
              after a match.  Arguments `A', `B' and `C' are the same as
              options -A, -B and -C when used with --hexdump.  See also
              options -U, -W and -X.

       --hidden, -.
              Search hidden files and directories (enabled by default in grep
              compatibility mode).

       --hyperlink[=[PREFIX][+]]
              Hyperlinks are enabled for file names when colors are enabled.
              Same as --colors=hl.  When PREFIX is specified, replaces file://
              with PREFIX:// in the hyperlink.  A `+' includes the line number
              in the hyperlink and when option -k is specified, the column
              number.

       -I, --ignore-binary
              Ignore matches in binary files.  This option is equivalent to
              the --binary-files=without-match option.  Files having NUL
              (zero) bytes are binary.  Also files with invalid UTF encoding
              are binary unless option -U or --ascii or --binary is specified.

       -i, --ignore-case
              Perform case insensitive matching.  By default, ugrep is case
              sensitive.

       --ignore-files[=FILE]
              Ignore files and directories matching the globs in each FILE
              that is encountered in recursive searches.  The default FILE is
              `.gitignore'.  Matching files and directories located in the
              directory of the FILE and in subdirectories below are ignored.
              Globbing syntax is the same as the --exclude-from=FILE gitignore
              syntax, but files and directories are excluded instead of only
              files.  Directories are specifically excluded when the glob ends
              in a `/'.  Files and directories explicitly specified as command
              line arguments are never ignored.  This option may be repeated
              to specify additional files.

       --no-ignore-files
              Do not ignore files, i.e. cancel --ignore-files when specified.

       --include=GLOB
              Only search files whose name matches GLOB, same as -g GLOB.
              GLOB may use **, *, ?, and [...] as wildcards and \ to quote a
              wildcard or backslash character literally.  When GLOB contains a
              `/', full pathnames are matched and option -r is enabled to
              recurse into directories if -d, -r or -R is not already
              specified.  Otherwise basenames are matched.  When GLOB ends
              with a `/', directories are included as if --include-dir is
              specified.  Otherwise files are included.  Note that --exclude
              patterns take priority over --include patterns.  GLOB should be
              quoted to prevent shell globbing.  This option may be repeated.

       --include-dir=GLOB
              Only directories whose name matches GLOB are included in
              recursive searches, same as -g GLOB/.  GLOB may use **, *, ?,
              and [...] as wildcards and \ to quote a wildcard or backslash
              character literally.  When GLOB contains a `/', full pathnames
              are matched and option -r is enabled to recurse into directories
              if -d, -r or -R is not already specified.  Otherwise basenames
              are matched.  Note that --exclude-dir patterns take priority
              over --include-dir patterns.  GLOB should be quoted to prevent
              shell globbing.  This option may be repeated.

       --include-from=FILE
              Read the globs from FILE and search only files and directories
              whose name matches one or more globs.  A glob may use **, *, ?,
              and [...] as wildcards and \ to quote a wildcard or backslash
              character literally.  When a glob contains a `/', full pathnames
              are matched.  Otherwise basenames are matched.  When a glob ends
              with a `/', directories are included as if --include-dir is
              specified.  Otherwise files are included.  A glob starting with
              a `!' overrides previously-specified inclusions by excluding
              matching files.  Lines starting with a `#' and empty lines in
              FILE are ignored.  When FILE is a `-', standard input is read.
              This option may be repeated.

       --include-fs=MOUNTS
              Only file systems specified by MOUNTS are included in recursive
              searches.  MOUNTS is a comma-separated list of mount points or
              pathnames to directories.  When MOUNTS is not specified,
              restricts recursive searches to the file system of the working
              directory, same as --include-fs=. (dot). Note that
              --exclude-fs=MOUNTS take priority over --include-fs=MOUNTS.
              This option may be repeated.

       --index
              Perform fast index-based recursive search.  This option assumes,
              but does not require, that files are indexed with ugrep-indexer.
              This option also enables option -r or --recursive.  Skips
              indexed non-matching files, archives and compressed files.
              Significant acceleration may be achieved on cold (not
              file-cached) and large file systems, or any file system that is
              slow to search.  Note that the start-up time to search may be
              increased when complex search patterns are specified that
              contain large Unicode character classes combined with `*' or `+'
              repeats, which should be avoided.  Option -U or --ascii or
              --binary improves performance.  Option --stats displays an index
              search report.

       -J NUM, --jobs=NUM
              Specifies the number of threads spawned to search files.  By
              default an optimum number of threads is spawned to search files
              simultaneously.  -J1 disables threading: files are searched in
              the same order as specified.

       -j, --smart-case
              Perform case insensitive matching, unless a pattern is specified
              with a literal upper case letter.

       --json Output file matches in JSON.  When -H, -n, -k, or -b is
              specified, additional values are output.  See also options
              --format and -u.

       -K [MIN,][MAX], --range=[MIN,][MAX], --min-line=MIN, --max-line=MAX
              Start searching at line MIN, stop at line MAX when specified.

       -k, --column-number
              The column number of a pattern match is displayed in front of
              the respective matched line, starting at column 1.  Tabs are
              expanded in counting columns, see also option --tabs.

       -L, --files-without-match
              Only the names of files not containing selected lines are
              written to standard output.  Pathnames are listed once per file
              searched.  If the standard input is searched, the string
              ``(standard input)'' is written.

       -l, --files-with-matches
              Only the names of files containing selected lines are written to
              standard output.  ugrep will only search a file until a match
              has been found, making searches potentially less expensive.
              Pathnames are listed once per file searched.  If the standard
              input is searched, the string ``(standard input)'' is written.

       --label=LABEL
              Displays the LABEL value when input is read from standard input
              where a file name would normally be printed in the output.
              Associates a filename extension with standard input when LABEL
              has a suffix.  The default value is `(standard input)'.

       --line-buffered
              Force output to be line buffered instead of block buffered.

       --lines
              Boolean line matching mode for option --bool, the default mode.

       -M MAGIC, --file-magic=MAGIC
              Only search files matching the magic signature pattern MAGIC.
              The signature "magic bytes" at the start of a file are compared
              to the MAGIC regex pattern.  When matching, the file will be
              searched.  When MAGIC is preceded by a `!' or a `^', skip files
              with matching MAGIC signatures.  This option may be repeated and
              may be combined with options -O and -t.  Every file on the
              search path is read, making recursive searches potentially more
              expensive.

       -m [MIN,][MAX], --min-count=MIN, --max-count=MAX
              Require MIN matches, stop after MAX matches when specified.
              Output MIN to MAX matches.  For example, -m1 outputs the first
              match and -cm1, (with a comma) counts nonzero matches.  When -u
              or --ungroup is specified, each individual match counts.  See
              also option -K.

       --match
              Match all input.  Same as specifying an empty pattern to search.

       --max-files=NUM
              Restrict the number of files matched to NUM.  Note that --sort
              or -J1 may be specified to produce replicable results.  If
              --sort is specified, then the number of threads spawned is
              limited to NUM.

       --mmap[=MAX]
              Use memory maps to search files.  By default, memory maps are
              used under certain conditions to improve performance.  When MAX
              is specified, use up to MAX mmap memory per thread.

       -N PATTERN, --neg-regexp=PATTERN
              Specify a negative PATTERN to reject specific -e PATTERN matches
              with a counter pattern.  Note that longer patterns take
              precedence over shorter patterns, i.e. a negative pattern must
              be of the same length or longer to reject matching patterns.
              Option -N cannot be specified with -P.  This option may be
              repeated.

       -n, --line-number
              Each output line is preceded by its relative line number in the
              file, starting at line 1.  The line number counter is reset for
              each file processed.

       --not [-e] PATTERN
              Specifies that PATTERN should not match.  Note that -e A --not
              -e B matches lines with `A' or lines without a `B'.  To match
              lines with `A' that have no `B', specify -e A --andnot -e B.
              Option --stats displays the search patterns applied.  See also
              options --and, --andnot, --bool, --files and --lines.

       --null, -0
              Output a zero byte after the file name.  This option can be used
              with commands such as `find -print0' and `xargs -0' to process
              arbitrary file names, even those that contain newlines.  See
              also options -H or --with-filename and --null-data.

       --null-data, -00
              Input and output are treated as sequences of lines with each
              line terminated by a zero byte instead of a newline; effectively
              swaps NUL with LF in the input and the output.  When combined
              with option --encoding=ENCODING, output each line terminated by
              a zero byte without affecting the input specified as per
              ENCODING.  Instead of option --null-data, option
              --encoding=null-data treats the input as a sequence of lines
              terminated by a zero byte without affecting the output.  Option
              --null-data is not compatible with UTF-16/32 input.  See also
              options --encoding and --null.

       -O EXTENSIONS, --file-extension=EXTENSIONS
              Only search files whose filename extensions match the specified
              comma-separated list of EXTENSIONS, same as -g '*.ext' for each
              `ext' in EXTENSIONS.  When an `ext' is preceded by a `!' or a
              `^', skip files whose filename extensions matches `ext', same as
              -g '^*.ext'.  This option may be repeated and may be combined
              with options -g, -M and -t.

       -o, --only-matching
              Only the matching part of a pattern match is output.  When -A,
              -B or -C is specified, fits the match and its context on a line
              within the specified number of columns.

       --only-line-number
              Only the line number of a matching line is output.  The line
              number counter is reset for each file processed.

       --files, -%%
              Boolean file matching mode, the opposite of --lines.  When
              combined with option --bool, matches a file if all Boolean
              conditions are satisfied.  For example, --bool --files 'A B|C
              -D' matches a file if some lines match `A', and some lines match
              either `B' or `C', and no line matches `D'.  See also options
              --and, --andnot, --not, --bool and --lines.  The double short
              option -%% enables options --bool --files.

       -P, --perl-regexp
              Interpret PATTERN as a Perl regular expression using PCRE2.
              Note that Perl pattern matching differs from the default grep
              POSIX pattern matching.

       -p, --no-dereference
              If -R or -r is specified, do not follow symbolic links, even
              when symbolic links are specified on the command line.

       --pager[=COMMAND]
              When output is sent to the terminal, uses COMMAND to page
              through the output.  COMMAND defaults to environment variable
              PAGER when defined or `less'.  Enables --heading and
              --line-buffered.

       --pretty[=WHEN]
              When output is sent to a terminal, enables --color, --heading,
              -n, --sort, --tree and -T when not explicitly disabled.  WHEN
              can be `never', `always', or `auto'.  The default is `auto'.

       -Q[=DELAY], --query[=DELAY]
              Query mode: start a TUI to perform interactive searches.  This
              mode requires an ANSI capable terminal.  An optional DELAY
              argument may be specified to reduce or increase the response
              time to execute searches after the last key press, in increments
              of 100ms, where the default is 3 (300ms delay).  No whitespace
              may be given between -Q and its argument DELAY.  Initial
              patterns may be specified with -e PATTERN, i.e. a PATTERN
              argument requires option -e.  Press F1 or CTRL-Z to view the
              help screen.  Press F2 or CTRL-Y to invoke a command to view or
              edit the file shown at the top of the screen.  This command can
              be specified with option --view and defaults to environment
              variable PAGER when defined, or VISUAL or EDITOR.  Press TAB or
              SHIFT-TAB to navigate directories and to select a file to
              search.  Press ENTER to select lines to output.  Press ALT-l for
              option -l to list files, ALT-n for -n, etc.  Non-option commands
              include ALT-] to increase context and ALT-} to increase
              fuzzyness.  If ALT or OPTION keys are not available, then press
              CTRL-O + KEY to switch option `KEY', or press F1 or CTRL-Z for
              help and press KEY.  See also options --no-confirm, --delay,
              --split and --view.

       -q, --quiet, --silent
              Quiet mode: suppress all output.  Only search a file until a
              match has been found.

       -R, --dereference-recursive
              Recursively read all files under each directory, following
              symbolic links to files and directories, unlike -r.

       -r, --recursive
              Recursively read all files under each directory, following
              symbolic links only if they are on the command line.  Note that
              when no FILE arguments are specified and input is read from a
              terminal, recursive searches are performed as if -r is
              specified.

       --replace=FORMAT
              Replace matching patterns in the output by FORMAT with `%'
              fields.  If -P is specified, FORMAT may include `%1' to `%9',
              `%[NUM]#' and `%[NAME]#' to output group captures.  A `%%'
              outputs `%' and `%~' outputs a newline.  See also option
              --format, `ugrep --help format' and `man ugrep' section FORMAT
              for details.

       -S, --dereference-files
              When -r is specified, follow symbolic links to files, but not to
              directories.  The default is not to follow symbolic links.

       -s, --no-messages
              Silent mode: nonexistent and unreadable files are ignored and
              their error messages and warnings are suppressed.

       --save-config[=FILE] [OPTIONS]
              Save configuration FILE to include OPTIONS.  Update FILE when
              first loaded with --config=FILE.  The default FILE is `.ugrep',
              which is automatically loaded by the ug command.  When FILE is a
              `-', writes the configuration to standard output.  Only part of
              the OPTIONS are saved that do not cause searches to fail when
              combined with other options.  Additional options may be
              specified by editing the saved configuration file.  A
              configuration file may be modified by adding one or more
              config=FILE to include configuration files, but recursive
              configuration file inclusion is not permitted.

       --separator[=SEP], --context-separator=SEP
              Use SEP as field separator between file name, line number,
              column number, byte offset and the matched line.  The default
              separator is a colon (`:') and a bar (`|') for multi-line
              pattern matches, and a dash (`-') for context lines.  See also
              option --group-separator.

       --split
              Split the -Q query TUI screen on startup.

       --sort[=KEY]
              Displays matching files in the order specified by KEY in
              recursive searches.  Normally the ug command sorts by name
              whereas the ugrep batch command displays matches in no
              particular order to improve performance.  The sort KEY can be
              `name' to sort by pathname (default), `best' to sort by best
              match with option -Z (sort by best match requires two passes
              over files, which is expensive), `size' to sort by file size,
              `used' to sort by last access time, `changed' to sort by last
              modification time and `created' to sort by creation time.
              Sorting is reversed with `rname', `rbest', `rsize', `rused',
              `rchanged', or `rcreated'.  Archive contents are not sorted.
              Subdirectories are sorted and displayed after matching files.
              FILE arguments are searched in the same order as specified.

       --stats
              Output statistics on the number of files and directories
              searched and the inclusion and exclusion constraints applied.

       -T, --initial-tab
              Add a tab space to separate the file name, line number, column
              number and byte offset with the matched line.

       -t TYPES, --file-type=TYPES
              Search only files associated with TYPES, a comma-separated list
              of file types.  Each file type corresponds to a set of filename
              extensions passed to option -O and filenames passed to option
              -g.  For capitalized file types, the search is expanded to
              include files with matching file signature magic bytes, as if
              passed to option -M.  When a type is preceded by a `!' or a `^',
              excludes files of the specified type.  Specifying the initial
              part of a type name suffices when the choice is unambiguous.
              This option may be repeated.  The possible file types can be
              (-tlist displays a list): `actionscript', `ada', `adoc', `asm',
              `asp', `aspx', `autoconf', `automake', `awk', `Awk', `basic',
              `batch', `bison', `c', `c++', `clojure', `cpp', `csharp', `css',
              `csv', `dart', `Dart', `delphi', `elisp', `elixir', `erlang',
              `fortran', `gif', `Gif', `go', `groovy', `gsp', `haskell',
              `html', `jade', `java', `jpeg', `Jpeg', `js', `json', `jsp',
              `julia', `kotlin', `less', `lex', `lisp', `lua', `m4', `make',
              `markdown', `matlab', `node', `Node', `objc', `objc++', `ocaml',
              `parrot', `pascal', `pdf', `Pdf', `perl', `Perl', `php', `Php',
              `png', `Png', `prolog', `python', `Python', `r', `rpm', `Rpm',
              `rst', `rtf', `Rtf', `ruby', `Ruby', `rust', `scala', `scheme',
              `seed7', `shell', `Shell', `smalltalk', `sql', `svg', `swift',
              `tcl', `tex', `text', `tiff', `Tiff', `tt', `typescript',
              `verilog', `vhdl', `vim', `xml', `Xml', `yacc', `yaml', `zig'.

       --tabs[=NUM]
              Set the tab size to NUM to expand tabs for option -k.  The value
              of NUM may be 1 (no expansion), 2, 4, or 8.  The default size is
              8.

       --tag[=TAG[,END]]
              Disables colors to mark up matches with TAG.  END marks the end
              of a match if specified, otherwise TAG.  The default is `___'.

       --tree, -^
              Output directories with matching files in a tree-like format for
              option -c or --count, -l or --files-with-matches, -L or
              --files-without-match.  This option is enabled by --pretty when
              the output is sent to a terminal.

       -U, --ascii, --binary
              Disables Unicode matching for ASCII and binary matching.
              PATTERN matches bytes.  For example, -U '\xa3' matches byte A3
              (hex) instead of the Unicode code point U+00A3 represented by
              the UTF-8 sequence C2 A3.  Input is not flagged as "binary" for
              having invalid UTF, only for having NUL (zero) bytes.

       -u, --ungroup
              Do not group multiple pattern matches on the same matched line.
              Output the matched line again for each additional pattern match.

       -V, --version
              Display version with linked libraries and exit.

       -v, --invert-match
              Selected lines are those not matching any of the specified
              patterns.

       --view[=COMMAND]
              Use COMMAND to view/edit a file in -Q query TUI by pressing
              CTRL-Y.

       -W, --with-hex
              Output binary matches in hexadecimal, leaving text matches
              alone.  This option is equivalent to the --binary-files=with-hex
              option.  To omit the matching line from the hex output, use both
              options -W and --hexdump.  See also options -U.

       -w, --word-regexp
              The PATTERN is searched for as a word, such that the matching
              text is preceded by a non-word character and is followed by a
              non-word character.  Word-like characters are Unicode letters,
              digits and connector punctuations such as underscore.

       --width[=NUM]
              Truncate the output to NUM visible characters per line.  The
              width of the terminal window is used if NUM is not specified.
              Note that double-width characters in the output may result in
              wider lines.

       -X, --hex
              Output matches and matching lines in hexadecimal.  This option
              is equivalent to the --binary-files=hex option.  To omit the
              matching line from the hex output use option --hexdump.  See
              also option -U.

       -x, --line-regexp
              Select only those matches that exactly match the whole line, as
              if the patterns are surrounded by ^ and $.

       --xml  Output file matches in XML.  When -H, -n, -k, or -b is
              specified, additional values are output.  See also options
              --format and -u.

       -Y, --empty
              Empty-matching patterns match all lines.  Normally, empty
              matches are not output, unless a pattern starts with `^' or ends
              with `$'.  With this option, empty-matching patterns, such as
              x*y?, x*y*z*, and x*(y?|z) match all lines, not only the
              expected pattern.  This option is enabled by default in grep
              compatibility mode; specify option --no-empty to prevent
              matching all lines.

       -y, --any-line, --passthru
              Any line is output (passthru).  Non-matching lines are output as
              context with a `-' separator.  See also options -A, -B and -C.

       -Z[best][+-~][MAX], --fuzzy[=[best][+-~][MAX]]
              Fuzzy mode: report approximate pattern matches within MAX
              errors.  The default is -Z1: one deletion, insertion or
              substitution is allowed.  If `+`, `-' and/or `~' is specified,
              then `+' allows insertions, `-' allows deletions and `~' allows
              substitutions.  For example, -Z+~3 allows up to three insertions
              or substitutions, but no deletions.  If `best' is specified,
              then only the best matching lines are output with the lowest
              cost per file.  Option -Zbest requires two passes over a file
              and cannot be used with standard input or Boolean queries.
              Option --sort=best orders matching files by best match.  The
              first character of an approximate match always matches a
              character at the beginning of the pattern.  To fuzzy match the
              first character, replace it with a `.' or `.?'.  Option -U
              applies fuzzy matching to ASCII and bytes instead of Unicode
              text.  No whitespace may be given between -Z and its argument.

       -z, --decompress
              Search compressed files and archives.  Archives (.cpio, .pax,
              .tar) and compressed archives (e.g. .zip, .7z, .taz, .tgz, .tpz,
              .tbz, .tbz2, .tb2, .tz2, .tlz, .txz, .tzst) are searched and
              matching pathnames of files in archives are output in braces.
              When used with option --zmax=NUM, searches the contents of
              compressed files and archives stored within archives up to NUM
              levels.  When -g, -O, -M, or -t is specified, searches archives
              for files that match the specified globs, filename extensions,
              file signature magic bytes, or file types, respectively; a
              side-effect of these options is that the compressed files and
              archives searched are only those with filename extensions that
              match known compression and archive types.  Supported
              compression formats: gzip (.gz), compress (.Z), zip, 7z, bzip2
              (.bz, .bz2, .bzip2, .tbz, .tbz2, .tb2, .tz2), xz (.xz, .txz) and
              lzma (requires suffix .lzma, .tlz), zstd (.zst, .zstd, .tzst),
              lz4 (requires suffix .lz4), brotli (requires suffix .br).

       --zmax=NUM
              When used with option -z or --decompress, searches the contents
              of compressed files and archives stored within archives by up to
              NUM expansion stages.  The default --zmax=1 only permits
              searching uncompressed files stored in cpio, pax, tar, zip and
              7z archives; compressed files and archives are detected as
              binary files and are effectively ignored.  Specify --zmax=2 to
              search compressed files and archives stored in cpio, pax, tar,
              zip and 7z archives.  NUM may range from 1 to 99 for up to 99
              decompression and de-archiving steps.  Increasing NUM values
              gradually degrades performance.

EXIT STATUS
       The ugrep utility exits with one of the following values:

       0      One or more lines were selected.

       1      No lines were selected.

       >1     An error occurred.

       If -q or --quiet or --silent is used and a line is selected, the exit
       status is 0 even if an error occurred.

CONFIGURATION
       The ug command is intended for interactive searching and is equivalent
       to the ugrep --config --pretty --sort command to load the `.ugrep`
       configuration file located in the working directory or, when not found,
       in the home directory.

       A configuration file contains `NAME=VALUE' pairs per line, where `NAME`
       is the name of a long option (without `--') and `=VALUE' is an
       argument, which is optional and may be omitted depending on the option.
       Empty lines and lines starting with a `#' are ignored.

       The --config=FILE option and its abbreviated form ---FILE load the
       specified configuration file located in the working directory or, when
       not found, in the home directory.  An error is produced when FILE is
       not found or cannot be read.

       Command line options are parsed in the following order: the
       configuration file is loaded first, followed by the remaining options
       and arguments on the command line.

       The --save-config option saves a `.ugrep' configuration file to the
       working directory with a subset of the options specified on the command
       line.  Only part of the specified options are saved that do not cause
       searches to fail when combined with other options.  The --save-
       config=FILE option saves the configuration to FILE.  The configuration
       is written to standard output when FILE is a `-'.

GLOBBING
       Globbing is used by options -g (--glob and --iglob), --include,
       --include-dir, --include-from, --exclude, --exclude-dir, --exclude-from
       and --ignore-files to match pathnames or basenames in recursive
       searches.  Glob arguments for these options should be quoted to prevent
       shell globbing.

       Globbing supports gitignore syntax and the corresponding matching
       rules, except that a glob normally matches files but not directories.
       If a glob ends in a path separator `/', then it matches directories but
       not files, as if --include-dir or --exclude-dir is specified.  When a
       glob contains a path separator `/', the full pathname is matched.
       Otherwise the basename of a file or directory is matched.  For example,
       *.h matches foo.h and bar/foo.h.  bar/*.h matches bar/foo.h but not
       foo.h and not bar/bar/foo.h.  Use a leading `./' or just `/' to force
       /*.h to match foo.h in the working directory but not bar/foo.h.

       When a glob starts with a `^' or a `!' as in -g^GLOB, the match is
       negated.  Likewise, a `!' (but not a `^') may be used with globs in the
       files specified --include-from, --exclude-from, and --ignore-files to
       negate the glob match.  Empty lines or lines starting with a `#' are
       ignored.

       Glob Syntax and Conventions

       *      Matches anything except /.

       ?      Matches any one character except /.

       [abc-e]
              Matches one character a,b,c,d,e.

       [^abc-e]
              Matches one character not a,b,c,d,e,/.

       [!abc-e]
              Matches one character not a,b,c,d,e,/.

       /      When used at the start of a glob, matches the working directory.
              When used at the end of a glob, matches directories only.

       **/    Matches zero or more directories.

       /**    When used at the end of a glob, matches everything after the /.

       \?     Matches a ? or any other character specified after the
              backslash.

       Glob Matching Examples

       Note that exclude glob patterns take priority over include glob
       patterns when specified with options -g, --exclude, --exclude-dir,
       --include and include-dir.

       Glob patterns specified with prefix `!' in any of the files associated
       with --include-from, --exclude-from and --ignore-files will negate a
       previous glob match.  That is, any matching file or directory excluded
       by a previous glob pattern specified in the files associated with
       --exclude-from or --ignore-file will become included again.  Likewise,
       any matching file or directory included by a previous glob pattern
       specified in the files associated with --include-from will become
       excluded again.

ENVIRONMENT
       GREP_PATH
              May be used to specify a file path to pattern files.  The file
              path is used by option -f to open a pattern file, when the
              pattern file does not exist.  Defaults to
              /usr/local/share/ugrep/patterns when GREP_PATH is undefined.

       GREP_COLOR
              May be used to specify ANSI SGR parameters to highlight matches
              when option --color is used, e.g. 1;35;40 shows pattern matches
              in bold magenta text on a black background.  Deprecated in favor
              of GREP_COLORS, but still supported.

       GREP_COLORS
              May be used to specify ANSI SGR parameters to highlight matches
              and other attributes when option --color is used.  Its value is
              a colon-separated list of ANSI SGR parameters that defaults to
              cx=33:mt=1;31:fn=1;35:ln=1;32:cn=1;32:bn=1;32:se=36 with
              additional parameters for TUI colors
              :qp=1;32:qe=1;37;41:qm=1;32:ql=36:qb=1;35.  The mt=, ms=, and
              mc= capabilities of GREP_COLORS take priority over GREP_COLOR.
              Option --colors takes priority over GREP_COLORS.

GREP_COLORS
       Colors are specified as string of colon-separated ANSI SGR parameters
       of the form `what=substring', where `substring' is a semicolon-
       separated list of ANSI SGR codes or `k' (black), `r' (red), `g'
       (green), `y' (yellow), `b' (blue), `m' (magenta), `c' (cyan), `w'
       (white).  Upper case specifies background colors.  A `+' qualifies a
       color as bright.  A foreground and a background color may be combined
       with one or more font properties `n' (normal), `f' (faint), `h'
       (highlight), `i' (invert), `u' (underline).  Substrings may be
       specified for:

       sl=    selected lines.

       cx=    context lines.

       rv     swaps the sl= and cx= capabilities when -v is specified.

       mt=    matching text in any matching line.

       ms=    matching text in a selected line.  The substring mt= by default.

       mc=    matching text in a context line.  The substring mt= by default.

       fn=    filenames.

       ln=    line numbers.

       cn=    column numbers.

       bn=    byte offsets.

       se=    separators.

       rv     a Boolean parameter, switches sl= and cx= with option -v.

       hl     a Boolean parameter, enables filename hyperlinks (\33]8;;link).

       ne     a Boolean parameter, disables ``erase in line'' \33[K.

       qp=    TUI prompt.

       qe=    TUI errors.

       qr=    TUI regex.

       qm=    TUI regex meta characters.

       ql=    TUI regex lists and literals.

       qb=    TUI regex braces.

FORMAT
       Option --format=FORMAT specifies an output format for matches.  Option
       --replace=FORMAT only replaces the matching patterns.  Fields may be
       used in FORMAT, which expand into the following values:

              group %9, same as %[1]#; requires option -P.

       %[NUM]#
              the regex group capture NUM; requires option -P.

       %[NUM]b
              the byte offset of the group capture NUM; requires option -P.
              Use e for the ending byte offset and d for the byte length.

       %[NUM1|NUM2|...]#
              the first group capture NUM that matched; requires option -P.

       %[NUM1|NUM2|...]b
              the byte offset of the first group capture NUM that matched;
              requires option -P.  Use e for the ending byte offset and d for
              the byte length.

       %[NAME]#
              the NAMEd group capture; requires option -P and capturing
              pattern `(?<NAME>PATTERN)', see also %G.

       %[NAME]b
              the byte offset of the NAMEd group capture; requires option -P

       %[NAME1|NAME2|...]#
              the first NAMEd group capture that matched; requires option -P
              and capturing pattern `(?<NAME>PATTERN)', see also %G.

       %[NAME1|NAME2|...]b
              the byte offset of the first NAMEd group capture that matched;
              requires option -P and capturing pattern `(?<NAME>PATTERN)'.
              Use e for the ending byte offset and d for the byte length.

       %G     list of group capture indices/names that matched; requires

       %%     the percentage sign.

       Formatted output is written without a terminating newline, unless %~ or
       `\n' is explicitly specified in the format string.

       The [TEXT] part of a field is optional and may be omitted.  When
       present, the argument must be placed in [] brackets, for example %[,]F
       to output a comma, the pathname, and a separator.

       %[SEP]$ and %u are switches and do not send anything to the output.

       The separator used by the %F, %H, %I, %N, %K, %B, %S and %G fields may
       be changed by preceding the field by %[SEP]$.  When [SEP] is not
       provided, this reverts the separator to the default separator or the
       separator specified with --separator.

       Formatted output is written for each matching pattern, which means that
       a line may be output multiple times when patterns match more than once
       on the same line.  If field %u is specified anywhere in a format
       string, matching lines are output only once, unless option -u,
       --ungroup is specified or when more than one line of input matched the
       search pattern.

       Additional formatting options:

       --format-begin=FORMAT
              the FORMAT when beginning the search.

       --format-open=FORMAT
              the FORMAT when opening a file and a match was found.

       --format-close=FORMAT
              the FORMAT when closing a file and a match was found.

       --format-end=FORMAT
              the FORMAT when ending the search.

       The context options -A, -B, -C, -y, and display options --break,
       --heading, --color, -T, and --null have no effect on formatted output.
