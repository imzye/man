LED(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 LED(4)

NAME
     led – API for manipulating LED's, lamps and other annunciators

SYNOPSIS
     #include <dev/led/led.h>

     typedef void led_t(void *priv, int onoff);

     struct cdev *
     led_create_state(led_t *func, void *priv, char const *name, int state);

     struct cdev *
     led_create(led_t *func, void *priv, char const *name);

     void
     led_destroy(struct cdev *);

DESCRIPTION
     The led driver provides generic support for handling LEDs, lamps and
     other annunciators.

     The hardware driver must supply a function to turn the annunciator on and
     off and the device name of the annunciator relative to /dev/led/.  The
     priv argument is passed back to this on/off function and can be used
     however the hardware driver sees fit.

     The lamp can be controlled by opening and writing ASCII strings to the
     /dev/led/bla device.

     In the following, we will use this special notation to indicate the
     resulting output of the annunciator:

           *       The annunciator is on for 1/10th second.
           _       The annunciator is off for 1/10th second.

     State can be set directly, and since the change happens immediately, it
     is possible to flash the annunciator with very short periods and
     synchronize it with program events.  It should be noted that there is a
     non-trivial overhead, so this may not be usable for benchmarking or
     measuring short intervals.

           0       Turn the annunciator off immediately.
           1       Turn the annunciator on immediately.

     Flashing can be set with a given period.  The pattern continues
     endlessly.

           f       _*
           f1      _*
           f2      __**
           f3      ___***
           ...
           f9      _________*********

     Three high-level commands are available:

           d%d     Numbers.  Each digit is blinked out at 1/10th second, zero
                   as ten pulses.  Between digits a one second pause and after
                   the last digit a two second pause after which the sequence
                   is repeated.

           s%s     String.  This gives full control over the annunciator.
                   Letters ‘A’ ... ‘J’ turn the annunciator on for from 1/10th
                   to one full second.  Letters ‘a’ ... ‘j’ turn the
                   annunciator off for 1/10th to one full second.  Letters ‘u’
                   and ‘U’ turn the annunciator off and on respectively when
                   the next UTC second starts.  Unless terminated with a ‘.’,
                   the sequence is immediately repeated.

           m%s     Morse.

                         ‘.’     becomes ‘_*’
                         ‘-’     becomes ‘_***’
                         ‘ ’     becomes ‘__’
                         ‘\n’    becomes ‘____’

     The sequence is repeated after a one second pause.
