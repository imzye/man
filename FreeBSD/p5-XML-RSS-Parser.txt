NAME
       XML::RSS::Parser - A liberal object-oriented parser for RSS feeds.

SYNOPSIS
        #!/usr/bin/perl -w
        use strict;

        use XML::RSS::Parser;
        use FileHandle;

        my $p = XML::RSS::Parser->new;

        foreach my $i ( $feed->query('//item') ) {
            my $node = $i->query('title');
            print '  '.$node->text_content;
            print "\n";
        }

DESCRIPTION
       XML::RSS::Parser is a lightweight liberal parser of RSS feeds. This
       parser is "liberal" in that it does not demand compliance of a specific
       RSS version and will attempt to gracefully handle tags it does not
       expect or understand.  The parser's only requirements is that the file
       is well-formed XML and remotely resembles RSS. Roughly speaking, well
       formed XML with a "channel" element as a direct sibling or the root tag
       and "item" elements etc.

       There are a number of advantages to using this module then just using a
       standard parser-tree combination. There are a number of different RSS
       formats in use today. In very subtle ways these formats are not
       entirely compatible from one to another. XML::RSS::Parser makes a
       couple assumptions to "normalize" the parse tree into a more consistent
       form. For instance, it forces "channel" and "item" into a parent-child
       relationship. For more detail see "SPECIAL PROCESSING NOTES".

       This module is leaner then XML::RSS -- the majority of code was for
       generating RSS files. It also provides a XPath-esque interface to the
       feed's tree.

       While XML::RSS::Parser creates a normalized parse tree, it still leaves
       the mapping of overlapping and alternate tags common in the RSS format
       space to the developer. For this look at the XML::RAI (RSS Abstraction
       Interface) package which provides an object-oriented layer to
       XML::RSS::Parser trees that transparently maps these various tags to
       one common interface.

       XML::RSS::Parser is based on XML::Elemental, a a SAX-based package for
       easily parsing XML documents into a more native and mostly object-
       oriented perl form.

   SPECIAL PROCESSING NOTES
       There are a number of different RSS formats in use today. In very
       subtle ways these formats are not entirely compatible from one to
       another. What's worse is that there are unlabeled versions within the
       standard in addition to tags with overlapping purposes and vague
       definitions. (See Mark Pilgrim's "The myth of RSS compatibility"
       "/diveintomark.org/archives/2004/02/04/incompatible- rss" in http: for
       just a sampling of what I mean.) To ease working with RSS data in
       different formats, the parser does not create the feed's parse tree
       verbatim. Instead it makes a few assumptions to "normalize" the parse
       tree into a more consistent form.

       With the refactoring of this module and the switch to a true tree
       structure, the normalization process has been simplified. Some of the
       version 2x proved to be problematic with more advanced and complex
       feeds.

       •   The RSS namespace (if any) is extracted from the first sibling of
           the root tag. We don't use the root tag because in RSS 1.0 the root
           tag is in the RDF namespace and not RSS. That namespace is treated
           as the '#default' (no prefix) namespace for the parse tree.

       •   The parser will not include the root tags of "rss" or "RDF" in the
           tree. Namespace declaration information is still extracted.

       •   The parser forces "channel" and "item" into a parent-child
           relationship. In versions 0.9 and 1.0, "channel" and "item" tags
           are siblings.


       Two significant changes were made with the release of version 4.0.

       XML::RSS::Parser is not a subclass of XML::Elemental.
           This change should be transparent in most cases, but deemed
           necessary for the error handling and special handling of RSS data.

       XML::RSS::Parser uses Clarkian Notation for element and attribute
       names.
           This change is inherited from recent changes in XML::Elemental. The
           previous system was flawed and not widely adopted. Clarkian
           notation is the form used by XML::SAX and XML::Simple to name a
           few. Use the "process_name" in XML::Elemental::Util to parse
           element and attribute names intoo their namespace URI and local
           name parts.

NAMESPACE PREFIXES
       The following prefix and namespace combinations are recognized by
       default. Use "register_ns_prefix" to add more as needed.

METHODS
       The following objects and methods are provided in this package.

       XML::RSS::Parser->new
           Constructor. Returns a reference to a new XML::RSS::Parser object.

       $parser->parse =item $parser->parse_file =item $parser->parse_string
       =item $parser->parse_uri
           These methods are mostly pass-thru to the underlying SAX parser
           provided by XML::Elemental. (See XML::SAX::Base for more.)

           XML::RSS::Parser wraps these calls in eval statements and rather
           then dying returns undefined. Any parsing errors can be retreived
           by using the "errstr" method inherited from Class::ErrorHandler.

           Once the markup has been parsed it is automatically passed through
           the "rss_normalize" method before the parse tree is returned to the
           caller.

       XML::RSS::Parser->register_ns_prefix(prefix,curi)
           Registers the given path with namespace URI for XPath lookups. Both
           parameters are required.

       XML::RSS::Parser->ns_qualify(element, namespace_uri)
           An simple utility implemented as an abstract method that will
           return a fully namespace qualified string for the supplied element.
           Return values are now in Clarkian notation.

       XML::RSS::Parser->prefix(namespace_uri)
           Returns the prefix to the given namespace URI. Returns "undef" if
           the prefix is not known.

       XML::RSS::Parser->namespace(prefix)
           Returns the namespace URI to the given prefix. Returns "undef" if
           the namespace is not registered.

       error
           Sets an error message for later retreival and returns "undef".
           Inherited from Class::ErrorHandler.

       errstr
           Returns the last error message set by "error". Inherited from
           Class:ErrorHandler.

DEPENDENCIES
       XML::SAX, XML::Elemental, Class::ErrorHandler, Class::XPath 1.4*

       Versions up to 1.4 have a design flaw that would cause it to choke on
       feeds with the / character in an attribute value.  For example the
       Yahoo! feeds.
