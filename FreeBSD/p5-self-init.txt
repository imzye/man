NAME
       self::init - Invoke package init methods at compile time

VERSION
       Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
           # At compile time
           use self::init
               \-x => qw( y z ), # same as BEGIN { CLASS->x('y','z'); }
           ;

           # At runtime
           self::init
               \-a => qw(a b),
               \-b => (),
               \-c => qw( c c ),
           ;

           # Same as
           CLASS->a('a','v');
           CLASS->b();
           CLASS->c('c','c');

           # With bad arguments (scalarrefs, containing string, beginning from -)
           self::init
               [ a => \'-arg1', \'-arg2' ],
               [ b => 'arg3', 'arg4' ],
           ;

           # ! Warning!
           # Mixed syntax is not allowed
           self::init
               \-a => qw(arg1 arg2),
               [ b => \'-arg1', \'-arg2' ],
           ;

           # will be invoked as

           CLASS->a('arg1','arg2', [ 'b', \'-arg1', \'-arg2' ] );

           # So be aware

DESCRIPTION
       This module is just a helper to avoid repetiotion of ugly
       __PACKAGE__->method();

INTERFACE
       self::init pragma
               use self::init ARGS;

       self::init statement
               self::init ARGS;

       ARGS
           Synopsis 1:

           Method name is constructed as a reference to string, containing
           method name, prefixed with '-'.  Rest in list is threated as
           arguments to that method, until next method name or end of whole
           statement.  So, if your arguments not written by hand or in some
           way could receive value of SCALARREF, containing string, beginning
           from -, invocation will be wrong (see Synopsis 2)

           When writing method names not quoted (hash key bareword), the whole
           statement looks like an ASCII tree, where methods are descendants
           of self::init ;)

               self::init
                   \-method1 => (1,2,3),
                   \-method_another => ('some', 'args'),
                   \-_private_method => (), # no args,
                   # so on
               ;

           Synopsis 2:

           Single method invocation is constructed as ARRAYREF, containing
           first element as method name and rest as arguments.  It is reliable
           to any arguments, but don't mix both synopsises in a single call

               self::init
                   [ method1 => 1,2,3 ],
                   [ method_another => 'some', 'args' ],
                   [ _private_method => (), ],  # no args
                   # so on
               ;
