COURIERPASSD(8)                 Authentication                 COURIERPASSD(8)

NAME
       courierpassd - change passwords from across the network using the
       Courier authentication library

SYNOPSIS
       courierpassd [-hV] [-s SERVICE] [--stderr]

       courierpassd -s, --service SERVICE

       courierpassd --stderr

       courierpassd -h, --help

       courierpassd -V, --version

DESCRIPTION
       courierpassd allows users to change their passwords from remote
       locations using the Courier authentication library. Usernames can be up
       to 64 characters long while passwords can be up to 128 characters long.


       courierpassd uses the poppassd protocol for obtaining authentication
       tokens from the network. courierpassd is intended to be run from a
       super-server such as tcpserver or xinetd.


       The service specified by the -s switch will depend on the particular
       authentication modules installed. Often 'login' will be appropriate but
       other possibilities include 'imap' and 'pop3'. This value defaults to
       'login'. See the Courier documentation for a further explanation of
       this switch.


       The minimum uid that courierpassd will attempt to change a password for
       can be set at compile time using the configure option --with-minuid.
       courierpassd will refuse to change the password of a user whose uid is
       below this value. The default value is 100. This value should never be
       set to 0 as this would allow root's password to be changed from a
       remote location.


       A second configure option, --with-badpassdelay, can be used to set the
       delay in seconds that courierpassd sleeps after an unsuccessful
       password change attempt. This feature is designed to make brute force
       attacks against passwords harder to perform. The default value is 3.


LOGGING
       Logging is done to syslog by default or to stderr if the --stderr
       switch is used.  courierpassd logs all password change attempts whether
       they are successful or not.

       courierpassd does certain checks on command line arguments so it is
       important to put --stderr first in the argument list if it is to be
       used in order for these checks to be logged properly.


EXAMPLE CLIENT-SERVER CONVERSATION
       All messages passed between server and client are text based allowing a
       client session to be easily mimicked with telnet. Using telnet,
       changing a user's password would look like this:

            Connected to localhost.localdomain (127.0.0.1).
            Escape character is '^]'.
            200 courierpassd 1.1.2 hello, who are you?\r\n
            user <username>\r\n
            200 Your password please.\r\n
            pass <current password>
            200 Your new password please.\r\n
            newpass <new password>\r\n
            200 Password changed, thank-you.\r\n
            quit\r\n
            200 Bye.\r\n
            Connection closed by foreign host.
