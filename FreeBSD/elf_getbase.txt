NAME
     elf_getbase – get the base offset for an object file

LIBRARY

SYNOPSIS

     to regular objects, the returned offset is (vacuously) zero.

RETURN VALUES
     Function elf_getbase() returns a valid file offset if successful, or
     (off_t) -1 in case of an error.

ERRORS
     Function elf_getbase() may fail with the following errors:

     [ELF_E_ARGUMENT]  Argument elf was NULL.
