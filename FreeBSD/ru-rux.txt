RUX(1)                  FreeBSD General Commands Manual                 RUX(1)

NAME
     rux – used for reading of files in Cyrillic encoding.

SYNOPSIS
     rux [-egtT] [-i incp] [-o outcp] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The rux is a simple and at the same time powerful utility for texts
     recoding from one encoding to another. At present time several the most
     popular Cyrillic code pages such as koi8-r, cp866, cp1251, iso-8859-5,
     mac-cyrillic and utf-8 are supported. Also rux gives the opportunity to
     recode box-drawing characters, which exists in some Cyrillic code pages,
     to replace them by their non-graphic analogues ('-', '+', etc.).

     Besides, the rux can detect a code page of the input files automatically.

     Usually rux is used without any options because some values are accepted
     by default. There are -o utf-8, -e, -t, -s 10240.

     However you can use the following options:

     -e    Replace box-drawing characters by their non-graphic analogues.
           Accepted by default.

     -g    Inverse of -e option. (Overrides any previous -e option).

     -t    Attempt to detect a code page of the input files. Accepted by
           default.

     -T    Same as -t, but don't actually recode the input files, just show
           their code pages.

     -i    Specify an input code page. Use -h option to determine the
           supported code pages list.

     -o    Specify an output code page. Default is ‘koi8-r’.

     -q    Suspress all warnings.

     -h    Show the short help message with the accepted flags and the
           supported code pages.

     The expectancy value of the presence of every Cyrillic characters in the
     some text were taken from the dump of Russian translation of the ‘FreeBSD
     Handbook’.

EXAMPLES
     The following is an example of usage of the rux command:

           $ ls -la *-text
           -rw-r--r-- 1 ghos users 24 Nov 18 18:03 dos-text
           -rw-r--r-- 1 ghos users 24 Nov 18 18:03 windows-text

           $ rux -T *-text
           dos-text: cp866
           windows-text: cp1251

     For example, this alias can be set for cp1251 encoding:

           $ alias cp1251='rux -i cp1251'
           $ cat windows-text | cp1251
           ..

     But this shell-script can be created:

           #!/bin/sh
           rux $@ | less

     and called as ruless :-):

           $ ruless cyr-text-file
           ..
           $ cat cyr-text-file | ruless
           ..
