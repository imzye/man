RPC_GSS_SECCREATE(3)   FreeBSD Library Functions Manual   RPC_GSS_SECCREATE(3)

NAME
     rpc_gss_seccreate – create a security context using the RPCSEC_GSS
     protocol

LIBRARY
     RPC GSS-API Authentication Library (librpcsec_gss, -lrpcsec_gss)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <rpc/rpcsec_gss.h>

     AUTH *
     rpc_gss_seccreate(CLIENT *clnt, const char *principal,
         const char  *mechanism, rpc_gss_service_t service, const char *qop,
         rpc_gss_options_req_t *options_req,
         rpc_gss_options_ret_t *options_ret);

DESCRIPTION
     This function is used to establish a security context between an
     application and a remote peer using the RPSEC_GSS protocol.

PARAMETERS
     clnt         An RPC handle which is connected to the remote peer

     principal    The name of the service principal on the remote peer.  For
                  instance, a principal such as "nfs@server.example.com" might
                  be used by an application which needs to contact an NFS
                  server

     mechanism    The desired mechanism for this security context.  The value
                  of mechanism should be the name of one of the security
                  mechanisms listed in /etc/gss/mech.

     service      Type of service requested.

                  rpc_gss_svc_default    The default - typically the same as
                                         rpc_gss_svc_none.

                  rpc_gss_svc_none       RPC headers only are integrity
                                         protected by a checksum.

                  rpc_gss_svc_integrity  RPC headers and data are integrity
                                         protected by a checksum.

                  rpc_gss_svc_privacy    RPC headers are integrity protected
                                         by a checksum and data is encrypted.

     qop          Desired quality of protection or NULL for the default.
                  Available values are listed in /etc/gss/qop

     options_req  Extra security context options to be passed to the
                  underlying GSS-API mechanism.  Pass NULL to supply default
                  values.

     options_ret  Various values returned by the underlying GSS-API mechanism.
                  Pass NULL if these values are not required.

RETURN VALUES
     If the security context was created successfully, a pointer to an AUTH
     structure that represents the context is returned.  To use this security
     context for subsequent RPC calls, set clnt->cl_auth to this value.
