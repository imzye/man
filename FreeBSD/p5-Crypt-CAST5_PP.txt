CAST5_PP(3)           User Contributed Perl Documentation          CAST5_PP(3)


NAME
       Crypt::CAST5_PP - CAST5 block cipher in pure Perl

SYNOPSIS
           use Crypt::CBC;

           my $crypt = Crypt::CBC->new({
               key    => "secret key",
               cipher => "CAST5_PP",
           });

           my $message = "All mimsy were the borogoves";
           my $ciphertext = $crypt->encrypt($message);
           print unpack("H*", $ciphertext), "\n";

           my $plaintext = $crypt->decrypt($ciphertext);
           print $plaintext, "\n";

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a pure Perl implementation of the CAST5 block
       cipher.  CAST5 is also known as CAST-128. It is a product of the CAST
       design procedure developed by C. Adams and S. Tavares.

       The CAST5 cipher is available royalty-free.

FUNCTIONS
   blocksize
       Returns the CAST5 block size, which is 8 bytes. This function exists so
       that Crypt::CAST5_PP can work with Crypt::CBC.

   keysize
       Returns the maximum CAST5 key size, 16 bytes.

   new
           $cast5 = Crypt::CAST5_PP->new($key);

       Create a new encryption object. If the optional key parameter is given,
       it will be passed to the init() function.

   init
           $cast5->init($key);

       Set or change the encryption key to be used. The key must be from 40
       bits (5 bytes) to 128 bits (16 bytes) in length. Note that if the key
       used is 80 bits or less, encryption and decryption will be somewhat
       faster.

       It is best for the key to be random binary data, not something
       printable like a password. A message digest function may be useful for
       converting a password to an encryption key; see Digest::SHA1 or
       Digest::MD5.  Note that Crypt::CBC runs the given "key" through MD5 to
       get the actual encryption key.

   encrypt
           $ciphertext = $cast5->encrypt($plaintext);

       Encrypt a block of plaintext using the current encryption key, and
       return the corresponding ciphertext. The input must be 8 bytes long,
       and the output has the same length. Note that the encryption is in ECB
       mode, which means that it encrypts each block independently. That can
       leave you vulnerable to dictionary attacks, so it is generally best to
       use some form of chaining between blocks; see Crypt::CBC.

   decrypt
           $plaintext = $cast5->decrypt($ciphertext);

       Decrypt the ciphertext and return the corresponding plaintext.

LIMITATIONS
       Always produces untainted output, even if the input is tainted, because
       that's what perl's pack() function does.
