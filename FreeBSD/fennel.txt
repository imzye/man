NAME
       fennel - a lisp programming language that runs on Lua

SYNOPSIS
       fennel [--repl] | [--compile filename] | [--eval source] | [filename]
       [args ...]


DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the fennel command.

       fennel is the main entry point for Fennel, a lisp programming language
       that runs on Lua runtimes. With no options or arguments, it runs an
       interactive Read-Eval-Print loop (REPL).

       Given a filename as its first argument, it runs that file and passes it
       the subsequent arguments. Ahead-of-time compilation can be invoked with
       the --compile flag, while short snippets can be evaluated with the
       --eval argument.


OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       --repl Start an interactive repl session. This is the default when
              given no arguments.

       --compile filename
              Perform ahead-of-time compilation on the provided file and write
              the Lua output to standard out.

       --eval source
              Evaluate a given piece of source code and print the result.

       --no-searcher
              When running a repl or a file, fennel.searcher is installed by
              default so that the require function can load Fennel files in
              addition to Lua files. This flag disables that behavior. Has no
              effect for ahead-of-time compilation.

       --add-package-path path
              Add the given path to package.path so that the require function
              will know to look there when searching for Lua modules.

       --add-fennel-path path
              Same as above, but for Fennel's path used when searching for
              Fennel modules.

       --globals VAR1[,VAR2...]
              Allow VAR1, VAR2, etc as globals in addition to the standard set
              of globals. This enables strict global checking even in ahead-
              of-time compilation where it otherwise would be disabled. Use
              "*" to disable globals checking.

       --globals-only VAR1[,VAR2...]
              Same as above, but without the inclusion of the standard set of
              globals.

       --require-as-include
              Instead of loading required modules at runtime, compile them
              inline into the main file being compiled. Only useful during
              ahead-of-time compilation.

       --assert-as-repl
              Calls to the built-in function assert from Fennel will be
              replaced with calls to assert-repl so that when the assertion
              fails, a REPL will be started in which you can interactively
              debug.

       --use-bit-lib
              Compile bitwise operations to use LuaJIT's bitop library instead
              of Lua 5.3+ bitwise operators.

       --load FILE
              Load the specified file before any command is run.

       --compile-binary FILE OUT LUA_LIB LUA_DIR
              Compile FILE to a standalone binary OUT using LUA_LIB and the
              Lua header files in LUA_DIR. See --compile-binary --help for
              details.

       --no-compiler-sandbox
              Do not limit compiler environment (used in macros) to minimal
              sandbox.

       --keywords KEYWORD1[,KEYWORD2...]
              Treat these symbols as reserved Lua keywords.

       -h, --help
              Print a help message and exit

       -v, --version
              Print the version number and exit

       Use the NO_COLOR environment variable to disable escape codes in error
       messages.


SEE ALSO
       The semantics are very close to Lua, so Lua's reference manual is also
       helpful.
