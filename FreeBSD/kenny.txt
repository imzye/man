NAME
       kenny.pl -- translate from and to KennySpeak

SYNOPSIS
       kenny.pl [ -h ] [ -u ] [ -k | -d ] [ file1 ] [ file2 ] ...

OVERVIEW
       kenny.pl translates a given text from or to KennySpeak. KennySpeak
       looks like this:

           "Ppfmfp ppmffm mfmppfmpm, fmpmfpmppffm'fpmmpp
            pmpmffpmfpmfmppmpm Pmpmppppppppffm!"

DESCRIPTION
       kenny.pl will read the given filenames, translate them and print the
       results on stdout. If you don't give a filename, stdin is used. A - as
       a filename means stdin.

       Without any parameters, kenny.pl will look at the first line of input
       and guess which way you want to translate. If kenny.pl guesses wrong,
       you must select the translation mode using the -k or -d switch.

   Switches
       -h   This will print a short notice and a quick summary of the
            available switches.

       -u   This will convert German umlauts to Ae, Oe, Ue, ae, oe, ue and ss
            so that they can be kennyfied correctly.

       -k   Kennyfy. This forces the input to be translated into KennySpeak.

       -d   Dekennyfy. This forces the input to be translated back from
            KennySpeak.

VERSION
       This is $Revision: 1.7 $.

BUGS
       The -u switch might not work for charsets other than Latin-1. You might
       try to convert the kenny.pl script using recode to change it from
       Latin-1 to your preferred charset.
