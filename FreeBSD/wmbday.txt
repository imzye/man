WMBDAY(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              WMBDAY(1)

NAME
       wmbday - dockable birthday reminder


SYNOPSIS
       wmbday [OPTIONS]


DESCRIPTIOIN
       wmbday displays the next 4 coming birthdays in a WindowMaker dock app.

       While running left clicking on one of the names will give information
       about the certain name in an xmessage box. A left click somewhere in
       the window while wmbday notifies you about a birthday will stop the
       animation.

       As of version 0.3 wmbday provides a modern look which is similar to
       various other dockapps. By pressing the right mouse button you can now
       switch the backlight on or off.

OPTIONS
        -d name, --display=name
              Specifies the X server to contact. See X(7x).

        -t, --text
              Enables the classical look.

        -f file, --file=file
              Use file as data file instead of ~/.wmbday/data

        -B color, --bgcolor=color
              Specifies either the color string (see section "Colors") used
              for filling the background or the backlight color.

        -F color, --fontcolor=color
              Specifies the color string (see section "Colors") used for
              painting normal text (also valid when using the new GUI).

        -H color, --hicolor=color
              Specifies the color string (see section "Colors") used for
              painting blinking text (also valid when using the new GUI).

        -h, --help
              Gives some help text.

        -v, --version
              Outputs the program version.


FORMAT OF THE DATA FILE
       Since version 0.2 wmbday supports two types of data files: vCard or
       simple.

       The format of the usual data file is quite simple. The first column
       contains the date and the second one the name. They are separated by an
       arbitrary amount of whitespaces (" ", "\r", "\t", "\n").

       dd.mm.yyyy[whitespace]name

       Notice that the date format is German and not English here.

       Names given in quotation can also be handled by wmbday.

       Also note that a line must not exceed 100 characters. But this should
       not be a problem due to the limited space of the dockapp.

       On the other hand you can use a vCard-address-book like it is used by
       KAddressbook for example. wmbday will only read the "FN" and "BDAY"
       lines. For more information on vCards see RFC 2426.


SIGNALS
       wmbday responds to the SIGHUP signal which makes it reload the data
       file.


COLORS
       Colors for wmbday can be specified in two ways. Either by the name
       ("red", "blue", "green") or by RGB values. For a complete list of color
       names supported by the Xlib please refer to /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rgb.txt.
       It would go beyond the scope of this manpage. For exotic colors you
       would have to use the second method anyway. But you have to note that
       different monitors show those colors differently. Names by Colors are
       more portable.

       If you want to specify the RGB value the format must be "#rrrrggggbbbb"
       where "r", "g" and "b" indicate the amount of the corresponding primary
       color in the target color in hexadecimal numbers. Numbers with less
       than 12 digits are filled with zeros so you can easily use "#rrggbb"
       instead. Note that you maybe have to escape the leading "#" in the
       shell.

FILES
        ~/.wmbday/data
              wmbday data file.


VERSION
       This man page is conform to version 0.3 of wmbday.
