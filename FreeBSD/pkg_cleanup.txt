PKG_CLEANUP(1)          FreeBSD General Commands Manual         PKG_CLEANUP(1)

NAME
       pkg_cleanup - deinstall 'leaf' packages

SYNOPSIS
       pkg_cleanup

DESCRIPTION
       pkg_rmleaves Finds packages that are not required by any other
       installed package and lets you decide (in a dialog interface) for each
       one if you want to delete it. The package comment is shown at the top
       of the screen and F1 will display the full package description.

       you'll be asked if you want to do another run (to see packages that
       have become 'leaves' now because you've deinstalled the package(s) that
       depended on them). In every run you will be shown only packages that
       you haven't marked for keeping, yet.

       functional difference is that this version shows the package comment
       and F1 will show the package description.

BUGS
       pkg_cleanup does not display the help line for the first selected
       package
