CRUNCHIDE(1)            FreeBSD General Commands Manual           CRUNCHIDE(1)

NAME
     crunchide – hides symbol names from ld, for crunching programs together

SYNOPSIS
     crunchide [-f keep-list-file] [-k keep-symbol] [object-file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The crunchide utility hides the global symbols of object-file such that
     they are ignored by subsequent runs of the linker, ld(1).  Some symbols
     may be left visible via the -k keep-symbol and -f keep-list-file options.
     The keep-list-file must contain a list of symbols to keep visible, one
     symbol per line.  The names given by keep-symbol or in keep-list-file
     should be C names.  For example, to keep the C function “foo” visible,
     the option “-k foo” should be used.

     The crunchide utility is designed as a companion program for
     crunchgen(1), which automates the process of creating crunched binaries
     from multiple component programs.

SEE ALSO
     crunchgen(1), ld(1)
