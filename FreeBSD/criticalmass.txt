       criticalmass [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents the game Critical Mass.  This manual page
       was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original
       program does not have a manual page.

       criticalmass is a space shootemup similar to Galaxian.  The basic idea
       is simple: you move your ship back and forth at the bottom of the
       screen, shooting up, while bad guys fly around and shoot down.

       Additional documentation is available in
