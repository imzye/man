NAME
       urclock (oUR CLOCK) -- clock and appointment reminder for X11

SYNOPSIS
          urclock [options]

DESCRIPTION
       urclock -- version 9.31 -- is an analog clock for X intended as an
       xclock(1) replacement that conserves memory and has extra features:
       urclock enters reverse video if there is mail waiting; an appointment
       reminder is also builtin.

   OPTIONS
       The options supported by urclock:

       -display displayname
           Attempt to open a window on the named X display. In the absence of
           this option, the display specified by the "DISPLAY" environment
           variable is used.

       -geometry geom
           Create the window with the specified X window geometry [default
           "80x80"].

       -bg color
           Window background color [default "white"].

       -fg color
           Window foreground color [default "black"].

       -fn fontname
           Select font used for reminders [default "7x14"].

       -nodate
           Do not display today's date on the face of the clock.

       -iconic
           Start iconified, if supported by the window manager.

       -adjust ddhhmm
           Adjust the clock by +/- ddhhmm (dd = days, hh = hours, mm =
           minutes) to fix an incorrect clock without being root or for
           working in another time-zone.

       -update n
           Update clock face every n seconds [default 30]. If n=1, a seconds
           hand is displayed.

       -mail n
           Check for new mail every n seconds [default 60]. The actual
           interval is a multiple of the clock update interval.

       -mailfile mailfile
           Override environmental variable "MAIL" with mailfile as location
           for mail.

       -mailspawn cmd
           Execute cmd when the face of the clock is clicked by the mouse
           button.

       #geom
           Specify the preferred icon window size [default "65x65"].

       Some of these options may not be available based on how urclock was
       compiled. Run urclock -help to determine which features are available.

X RESOURCES
       No X resources are used -- only command-line options.

TITLES AND ICONS
       The window and icon titles are set to the day of the week and the date.
       The date is also displayed on the lower half of the clock unless the
       -nodate option is specified. The icon window is "active" and will show
       the time, if supported by the window manager.

REMINDERS
       The ~/.rclock file (note: not ~/.urclock) lists the messages to display
       and/or the programs to run at specified times and dates. At the
       specified time, urclock will pop-up a window in the center of the
       screen to display the message or will simply run the scheduled program.
       urclock will read the ~/.rclock file at startup, and every 10 minutes
       (to look for changes) and after a message window has been dismissed (to
       find the next appointment).

       An entry in ~/.rclock may be one of two formats (blank and comment
       lines will be ignored):

       hh:mm  [dd]  MM/DD/YY message[; program]

       or

       [hh:mm  [dd]  MM/DD/YY [message]]; program

       hh - hour (0-23; * = current)

       mm - minute (0-59; * = 0)

       dd - days-of-week (some/all/none of umtwrfs; * = all)

       MM - month (1-12; * = current)

       DD - day of month (1-31; * = current)

       YY - year (0-99 or 1900-????; * = current)

       message - message to display

       program - program to execute

       The days-of-the-week use the following abbreviations: u=Sunday,
       m=Monday, t=Tuesday, w=Wednesday, r=Thursday, f=Friday, s=Saturday,
       *=all.

       If message is empty and program has been specified, it is executed
       without a dialog box. If time/date are also not specified, program is
       executed on start-up. Note message may contain escape values (\n:
       newline, \;: semicolon).

       Here's a silly example file that shows some of the permissible
       constructs:

          # ~/.rclock - My appointment file

          # startup functions
          ; xsetroot -solid Black &

          # cron functions

          10:00; xsetroot -solid Grey25 &
          14:00; xsetroot -solid Grey75 &

          # daily/weekly reminders

ENVIRONMENT
       urclock uses the environment variable MAIL to determine the location of
       the user's mail spool file unless the -mailfile option is specified.

BUGS
       urclock is not very smart about dealing with errors encountered while
       reading the ~/.rclock file. Each reminder must be a single line not
       exceeding 255 characters. Reminder windows are sometimes not redrawn
       (left blank) when raised or uncovered.

HISTORY
       When "unicodifying" rxvt to urxvt-unicode, other programs than rxvt
       were dropped, as they would be identical to their rxvt counterparts,
       and therefore could still be installed independently by installing
       rxvt.

       Since distributions have started dropping rxvt (and thus rclock), the
       rclock program has been added to the rxvt-unicode package under the
       name urclock. It should be functionally identical to rxvt's rclock
       program, including using the same configuration file name.
