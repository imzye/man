ECHO(1)                 FreeBSD General Commands Manual                ECHO(1)

NAME
     echo – write arguments to the standard output

SYNOPSIS
     echo [-n] [string ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The echo utility writes any specified operands, separated by single blank
     (‘ ’) characters and followed by a newline (‘\n’) character, to the
     standard output.

     The following option is available:

     -n    Do not print the trailing newline character.

     The end-of-options marker -- is not recognized and written literally.

     The newline may also be suppressed by appending ‘\c’ to the end of the
     string, as is done by iBCS2 compatible systems.  Note that the -n option
     as well as the effect of ‘\c’ are implementation-defined in IEEE Std
     1003.1-2001 (“POSIX.1”) as amended by Cor. 1-2002.  For portability, echo
     should only be used if the first argument does not start with a hyphen
     (‘-’) and does not contain any backslashes (‘\’).  If this is not
     sufficient, printf(1) should be used.

     Most shells provide a builtin echo command which tends to differ from
     this utility in the treatment of options and backslashes.  Consult the
     builtin(1) manual page.

EXIT STATUS
     The echo utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

STANDARDS
     The echo utility conforms to IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (“POSIX.1”) as amended
     by Cor. 1-2002.

HISTORY
     The echo command appeared in Version 2 AT&T UNIX.
