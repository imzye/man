Plack::Middleware::MethodOverride(3)       User Contributed Perl Documentation


Name
       Plack::Middleware::MethodOverride - Override REST methods to Plack apps
       via POST

Version
       version 0.20

Synopsis
       In your Plack app:

         use Plack::Builder;
         builder {
             enable MethodOverride;
             $app;
         };

       PUT via a query parameter in your POST forms:

         <form method="POST" action="/foo?x-tunneled-method=PUT">
           <!-- ... -->
         </form>

       Or override it via the "X-HTTP-Method-Override" header in a request:

         my $req = HTTP::Request->new(POST => '/foo', [
             'X-HTTP-Method-Override' => 'PUT'
         ]);

Description
       Writing REST
       <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer>ful apps
       is a good thing, but if you're also trying to support web browsers, it
       would be nice not to be reduced to "GET" and "POST" for everything.

       This middleware allows for "POST" requests that pretend to be something
       else: by adding either a header named "X-HTTP-Method-Override" to the
       request, or a query parameter named "x-tunneled-method" to the URI, the
       client can say what method it actually meant. That is, as long as it
       meant one of these:

       •   GET

       •   POST

       •   HEAD

       •   PUT

       •   DELETE

       •   OPTIONS

       •   TRACE

       •   CONNECT

       •   PATCH

       If so, then the "REQUEST_METHOD" in the PSGI environment will be
       replaced with the client's desired value. The original request method
       is always stored under the "plack.original_request_method" key.

Configuration
       These are the named arguments you can pass to "new". Or, more likely,
       on the "enable" line in your "builder" block, as in

          enable 'MethodOverride', header => 'X-HTTP-Method', param => 'my_method';

   "header"
       Specifies the HTTP header name which specifies the overriding HTTP
       method.

       Defaults to "X-HTTP-Method-Override", as used by Google for its APIs.

   "param"
       Specifies the query parameter name to specify the overriding HTTP
       method.

       Defaults to "x-tunneled-method".

Acknowledgements
       This module gleefully steals from
       Catalyst::TraitFor::Request::REST::ForBrowsers by Dave Rolsky and the
       original version by Tatsuhiko Miyagawa (which in turn stole from
       HTTP::Engine::Middleware::MethodOverride). Thanks to Aristotle
       Pagaltzis <http://plasmasturm.org/> for the shove in this direction, to
       Matt S Trout <http://www.trout.me.uk/> for suggesting that it be
       implemented as middleware, and to Hans Dieter Pearcey
       <http://www.weftsoar.net/> for convincing me not to parse body
       parameters.
