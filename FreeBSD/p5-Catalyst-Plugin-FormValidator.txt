NAME
       Catalyst::Plugin::FormValidator - Data::FormValidator plugin for
       Catalyst.

SYNOPSIS
           use Catalyst 'FormValidator';

           $c->form( optional => ['rest'] );
           print $c->form->valid('rest');

       Note that not only is this plugin disrecommended (as it takes over the
       global "$c->form" method, rather than being applyable in only part of
       your application), but Data::FormValidator itself is not recommended
       for use.

DESCRIPTION
       This plugin uses Data::FormValidator to validate and set up form data
       from your request parameters. It's a quite thin wrapper around that
       module, so most of the relevant information can be found there.

   EXTENDED METHODS
   METHODS
       form

       Merge values with FormValidator.

           $c->form( required => ['yada'] );

       Returns a Data::FormValidator::Results object.

           $c->form->valid('rest');

       The actual parameters sent to $c->form are the same as the profile in
       Data::FormValidator's check function.
