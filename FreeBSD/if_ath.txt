ATH(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 ATH(4)

NAME
     ath – Atheros IEEE 802.11 wireless network driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device ath
           device ath_pci
           device ath_hal
           device ath_rate_sample
           device wlan

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_ath_load="YES"
           if_ath_pci_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The ath driver provides support for wireless network adapters based on
     the Atheros AR5210, AR5211, AR5212, AR5416 and AR9300 programming APIs.
     These APIs are used by a wide variety of chips; most all chips with a
     PCI, PCIe and/or CardBus interface are supported.

     Supported features include 802.11 and 802.3 frames, power management,
     BSS, IBSS, MBSS, WDS/DWDS TDMA, and host-based access point operation
     modes.  All host/device interaction is via DMA.

     Please note that from FreeBSD-9.0, the ath driver does not include the
     PCI/PCIe bus glue.  The same driver supports multiple underlying bus
     types, including PCI/PCIe, but also embedded (AHB) and USB in the future.

     To enable use for PCI/PCIe systems, see the ath_pci(4) driver.  For
     embedded systems which use the AHB to connect the wireless MAC, see the
     ath_ahb(4) driver.

     The ath driver encapsulates all IP and ARP traffic as 802.11 frames,
     however it can receive either 802.11 or 802.3 frames.  Transmit speed and
     operating mode is selectable and depends on the specific chipset.
     AR5210-based devices support 802.11a operation with transmit speeds of 6
     Mbps, 9 Mbps, 12 Mbps, 18 Mbps, 24 Mbps, 36 Mbps, 48 Mbps, and 54 Mbps.
     AR5211-based devices support 802.11a and 802.11b operation with transmit
     speeds as above for 802.11a operation and 1Mbps, 2Mbps, 5.5 Mbps and
     11Mbps for 802.11b operation.  AR5212-based devices support 802.11a,
     802.11b, and 802.11g operation with transmit speeds appropriate to each.
     AR5416 and later class devices are capable of 802.11n operation.  Most
     chips also support an Atheros Turbo Mode (TM) that operates in the 5GHz
     frequency range with 2x the transmit speeds.  Some chips also support
     Turbo mode in the 2.4GHz range with 802.11g though this support is not
     presently available due to regulatory requirements.  (Note that Turbo
     modes are, however, only interoperable with other Atheros-based devices.)
     AR5212-based and AR5416-based devices also support half- (10MHz) and
     quarter-width (5MHz) channels.  The actual transmit speed used is
     dependent on signal quality and the “rate control” algorithm employed by
     the driver.  All chips support WEP encryption.  AR5212, AR5416 and later
     parts have hardware support for the AES-CCM, TKIP, and Michael
     cryptographic operations required for WPA.  To enable encryption, use
     ifconfig(8) as shown below.

     The driver supports station, adhoc, adhoc-demo, hostap, mesh, wds, and
     monitor mode operation.  Multiple hostap virtual interfaces may be
     configured for simultaneous use on cards that use a 5212 or later part.
     When multiple interfaces are configured each may have a separate mac
     address that is formed by setting the U/L bits in the mac address
     assigned to the underlying device.  Any number of wds virtual interfaces
     may be configured together with hostap interfaces.  Multiple station
     interfaces may be operated together with hostap interfaces to construct a
     wireless repeater device.  The driver also support tdma operation when
     compiled with options IEEE80211_SUPPORT_TDMA (which also enables the
     required 802.11 support).  For more information on configuring this
     device, see ifconfig(8).

     Devices supported by the ath driver come in Cardbus, ExpressCard, Mini-
     PCI and Mini-PCIe packages.  Wireless cards in Cardbus and ExpressCard
     slots may be inserted and ejected on the fly.

HARDWARE
     The ath driver supports all Atheros Cardbus, ExpressCard, PCI and PCIe
     cards, except those that are based on the AR5005VL chipset.

EXAMPLES
     Join a specific BSS network with WEP encryption:

           ifconfig wlan0 create wlandev ath0
           ifconfig wlan0 inet 192.168.0.20 netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_net \
                   wepmode on wepkey 0x8736639624

     Join/create an 802.11b IBSS network with network name “my_net”:

           ifconfig wlan0 create wlandev ath0 wlanmode adhoc
           ifconfig wlan0 inet 192.168.0.22 netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_net \
                   mode 11b

     Create an 802.11g host-based access point:

           ifconfig wlan0 create wlandev ath0 wlanmode hostap
           ifconfig wlan0 inet 192.168.0.10 netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_ap \
                   mode 11g

     Create an 802.11a mesh station:

           ifconfig wlan0 create wlandev ath0 wlanmode mesh
           ifconfig wlan0 meshid my_mesh mode 11a inet 192.168.0.10/24

     Create two virtual 802.11a host-based access points, one with WEP enabled
     and one with no security, and bridge them to the fxp0 (wired) device:

           ifconfig wlan0 create wlandev ath0 wlanmode hostap \
                   ssid paying-customers wepmode on wepkey 0x1234567890 \
                   mode 11a up
           ifconfig wlan1 create wlandev ath0 wlanmode hostap bssid \
                   ssid freeloaders up
           ifconfig bridge0 create addm wlan0 addm wlan1 addm fxp0 up

     Create a master node in a two slot TDMA BSS configured to use 2.5
     millisecond slots.

           ifconfig wlan0 create wlandev ath0 wlanmode tdma \
                   ssid tdma-test tmdaslot 0 tdmaslotlen 2500 \
                   channel 36 up

DIAGNOSTICS
     ath%d: unable to attach hardware; HAL status %u  The Atheros Hardware
     Access Layer was unable to configure the hardware as requested.  The
     status code is explained in the HAL include file
     sys/dev/ath/ath_hal/ah.h.

     ath%d: failed to allocate descriptors: %d  The driver was unable to
     allocate contiguous memory for the transmit and receive descriptors.
     This usually indicates system memory is scarce and/or fragmented.

     ath%d: unable to setup a data xmit queue!  The request to the HAL to set
     up the transmit queue for normal data frames failed.  This should not
     happen.

     ath%d: unable to setup a beacon xmit queue!  The request to the HAL to
     set up the transmit queue for 802.11 beacon frames failed.  This should
     not happen.

     ath%d: 802.11 address: %s  The MAC address programmed in the EEPROM is
     displayed.

     ath%d: hardware error; resetting  An unrecoverable error in the hardware
     occurred.  Errors of this sort include unrecoverable DMA errors.  The
     driver will reset the hardware and continue.

     ath%d: rx FIFO overrun; resetting  The receive FIFO in the hardware
     overflowed before the data could be transferred to the host.  This
     typically occurs because the hardware ran short of receive descriptors
     and had no place to transfer received data.  The driver will reset the
     hardware and continue.

     ath%d: unable to reset hardware; hal status %u  The Atheros Hardware
     Access Layer was unable to reset the hardware as requested.  The status
     code is explained in the HAL include file sys/dev/ath/ath_hal/ah.h.  This
     should not happen.

     ath%d: unable to start recv logic  The driver was unable to restart frame
     reception.  This should not happen.

     ath%d: device timeout  A frame dispatched to the hardware for
     transmission did not complete in time.  The driver will reset the
     hardware and continue.  This should not happen.

     ath%d: bogus xmit rate 0x%x  An invalid transmit rate was specified for
     an outgoing frame.  The frame is discarded.  This should not happen.

     ath%d: ath_chan_set: unable to reset channel %u (%u MHz)  The Atheros
     Hardware Access Layer was unable to reset the hardware when switching
     channels during scanning.  This should not happen.

     ath%d: failed to enable memory mapping  The driver was unable to enable
     memory-mapped I/O to the PCI device registers.  This should not happen.

     ath%d: failed to enable bus mastering  The driver was unable to enable
     the device as a PCI bus master for doing DMA.  This should not happen.

     ath%d: cannot map register space  The driver was unable to map the device
     registers into the host address space.  This should not happen.

     ath%d: could not map interrupt  The driver was unable to allocate an IRQ
     for the device interrupt.  This should not happen.

     ath%d: could not establish interrupt  The driver was unable to install
     the device interrupt handler.  This should not happen.

HISTORY
     The ath device driver first appeared in FreeBSD 5.2.

CAVEATS
     Revision A1 of the D-LINK DWL-G520 and DWL-G650 are based on an Intersil
     PrismGT chip and are not supported by this driver.

BUGS
     The driver does supports optional station mode power-save operation.

     The AR5210 can only do WEP in hardware; consequently hardware assisted
     WEP is disabled in order to allow software implementations of TKIP and
     CCMP to function.  Hardware WEP can be re-enabled by modifying the
     driver.
