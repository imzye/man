CTASSERT(9)            FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual           CTASSERT(9)

NAME
     CTASSERT – compile time assertion macro

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <sys/systm.h>

     CTASSERT(expression);

DESCRIPTION
     The CTASSERT() macro is deprecated and the C11 standard _Static_assert()
     should be used instead.  The header sys/cdefs.h should be included to
     provide compatibility for pre-C11 compilers.

     The CTASSERT() macro evaluates expression at compile time and causes a
     compiler error if it is false.

     The CTASSERT() macro is useful for asserting the size or alignment of
     important data structures and variables during compilation, which would
     otherwise cause the code to fail at run time.

EXAMPLES
     Assert that the size of the uuid structure is 16 bytes.

           CTASSERT(sizeof(struct uuid) == 16);
