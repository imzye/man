String::HexConvert(3)                      User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       String::HexConvert - Converts ascii strings to hex and reverse

SYNOPSIS
        use String::HexConvert ':all';

        print ascii_to_hex("hello world"); # writes: 68656c6c6f20776f726c64

        print hex_to_ascii("68656c6c6f20776f726c64"); # writes: hello world

DESCRIPTION
       It is a wrapper around pack and unpack of perl to convert a string of
       hex digits to ascii and other way around.

REQUIRES
       Exporter

METHODS
   ascii_to_hex
        my $hex = ascii_to_hex($ascii);

       Converts a string to pairs of hex digits

   hex_to_ascii
        my $ascii = hex_to_ascii($hex);

       Converts pairs of hex digits to asci

WHY?
       In know the comments like "is that realy needed?". IMHO yes, because I
       forget the exact syntax and possibilities of pack and unpack but
       hex_to_ascii tells me directly what pack "H*" does.
