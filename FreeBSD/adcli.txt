GENERAL OVERVIEW
       adcli is a command line tool that can perform actions in an Active
       Directory domain. Among other things it can be used to join a computer
       to a domain.

       See the various sub commands below. The following global options can be
       used:

       -D, --domain=domain
           The domain to connect to. If a domain is not specified, then the
           domain part of the local computer's host name is used.

       -R, --domain-realm=REALM
           Kerberos realm for the domain. If not specified, then the upper
           cased domain name is used.

       -S, --domain-controller=server
           Connect to a specific domain controller. If not specified, then an
           appropriate domain controller is automatically discovered.

       --use-ldaps
           Connect to the domain controller with LDAPS. By default the LDAP
           port is used and SASL GSS-SPNEGO or GSSAPI is used for
           authentication and to establish encryption. This should satisfy all
           requirements set on the server side and LDAPS should only be used
           if the LDAP port is not accessible due to firewalls or other
           reasons.

           Please note that the place where CA certificates can be found to
           validate the AD DC certificates must be configured in the OpenLDAP
           configuration file, e.g.  /etc/openldap/ldap.conf. As an
           alternative it can be specified with the help of an environment
           variable, e.g.

               $ LDAPTLS_CACERT=/path/to/ad_dc_ca_cert.pem adcli join --use-ldaps -D domain.example.com
               ...

           Please see ldap.conf(5) for details.

       -C
           Use the default Kerberos credential cache to authenticate with the
           domain.

       --login-ccache[=ccache_name]
           Use the specified Kerberos credential cache to authenticate with
           the domain. If no credential cache is specified, the default
           Kerberos credential cache will be used. Credential caches of type
           FILE can be given with the path to the file. For other credential
           cache types, e.g. DIR, KEYRING or KCM, the type must be specified
           explicitly together with a suitable identifier.

           Please note that since the ccache_name is optional the =(equal)
           sign is mandatory. If = is missing the parameter is treated as
           optionless extra argument. How this is handled depends on the
           specific sub-command.

       -U, --login-user=User
           Use the specified user account to authenticate with the domain. If
           not specified, then the name 'Administrator' will be used.

       --no-password
           Don't show prompts for or read a password from input.

       -W, --prompt-password
           Prompt for a password if necessary. This is the default.

       --stdin-password
           Read a password from stdin input instead of prompting for a
           password.

       -v, --verbose
           Run in verbose mode with debug output.

QUERYING DOMAIN INFORMATION
       adcli info displays discovered information about an Active Directory
       domain or an Active Directory domain controller.

           $ adcli info domain.example.com
           ...

           $ adcli info --domain-controller=dc.domain.example.com
           ...

       adcli info will output as much information as it can about the domain.
       The information is designed to be both machine and human readable. The
       command will exit with a non-zero exit code if the domain does not
       exist or cannot be reached.

       To show domain info for a specific domain controller use the
       --domain-controller option to specify which domain controller to query.

       Use the --verbose option to show details of how the domain is
       discovered and queried. Many of the global options, in particular
       authentication options, are not usable with the adcli info command.

JOINING THE LOCAL MACHINE TO A DOMAIN
       adcli join creates a computer account in the domain for the local
       machine, and sets up a keytab for the machine. It does not configure an
       authentication service (such as sssd).

           $ adcli join domain.example.com
           Password for Administrator:

       In addition to the global options, you can specify the following
       options to control how this operation is done.

       -N, --computer-name=computer
           The short non-dotted name of the computer account that will be
           created in the domain. If not specified, then the first portion of
           the --host-fqdn is used.

       -O, --domain-ou=OU=xxx
           The full distinguished name of the OU in which to create the
           computer account. If not specified, then the computer account will
           be created in a default location.

       -H, --host-fqdn=host
           Override the local machine's fully qualified domain name. If not
           specified, the local machine's hostname will be retrieved via
           gethostname(). If gethostname() only returns a short name
           getaddrinfo() with the AI_CANONNAME hint is called to expand the
           name to a fully qualified domain name.

       -K, --host-keytab=/path/to/keytab
           Specify the path to the host keytab where host credentials will be
           written after a successful join operation. If not specified, the
           default location will be used, usually /etc/krb5.keytab.

       --login-type={computer|user}
           Specify the type of authentication that will be performed before
           creating the machine account in the domain. If set to 'computer',
           then the computer must already have a preset account in the domain.
           If not specified and none of the other --login-xxx arguments have
           been specified, then will try both 'computer' and 'user'
           authentication.

       --os-name=name
           Set the operating system name on the computer account. The default
           depends on where adcli was built, but is usually something like
           'linux-gnu'.

       --os-service-pack=pack
           Set the operating system service pack on the computer account. Not
           set by default.

       --os-version=version
           Set the operating system version on the computer account. Not set
           by default.

       --description=description
           Set the description attribute on the computer account. Not set by
           default.

       --service-name=service
           Additional service name for a Kerberos principal to be created on
           the computer account. This option may be specified multiple times.

       --user-principal=host/name@REALM
           Set the userPrincipalName field of the computer account to this
           Kerberos principal. If you omit the value for this option, then a
           principal will be set in the form of host/host.example.com@REALM

       --one-time-password
           Specify a one time password for a preset computer account. This is
           equivalent to using --login-type=computer and providing a password
           as input.

       --trusted-for-delegation=yes|no|true|false
           Set or unset the TRUSTED_FOR_DELEGATION flag in the
           userAccountControl attribute to allow or not allow that Kerberos
           tickets can be forwarded to the host.

       --dont-expire-password=yes|no|true|false
           Set or unset the DONT_EXPIRE_PASSWORD flag in the
           userAccountControl attribute to indicate if the machine account
           password should expire or not. By default adcli will set this flag
           while joining the domain which corresponds to the default behavior
           of Windows clients.

           Please note that if the password will expire
           (--dont-expire-password=false) a renewal mechanism has to be
           enabled on the client to not loose the connectivity to AD if the
           password expires.

       --add-service-principal=service/hostname
           Add a service principal name. In contrast to the --service-name the
           hostname part can be specified as well in case the service should
           be accessible with a different host name as well.

       --setattr=name=value
           Add the LDAP attribute name with the given value to the new LDAP
           host object. This option can be used multiple times to add multiple
           different attributes. Multi-value attributes are currently not
           supported.

           Please note that the account used to join the domain must have the
           required privileges to add the given attributes. Some attributes
           might have constraints with respect to syntax and allowed values
           which must be met as well. Attributes managed by other adcli
           options cannot be set with this option.

       --show-details
           After a successful join print out information about join operation.
           This is output in a format that should be both human and machine
           readable.

       --show-password
           After a successful join print out the computer machine account
           password. This is output in a format that should be both human and
           machine readable.

       --add-samba-data
           After a successful join add the domain SID and the machine account
           password to the Samba specific databases by calling Samba's net
           utility.

           Please note that Samba's net requires some settings in smb.conf to
           create the database entries correctly. Most important here is
           currently the workgroup option, see smb.conf(5) for details.

       --samba-data-tool=/path/to/net
           If Samba's net cannot be found at /usr/bin/net, this option can be
           used to specific an alternative location with the help of an
           absolute path.

       --ldap-passwd
           Use LDAP add/mod operations to set the machine account password
           instead of Kerberos. This might help in some situations where
           Kerberos fails or is unreliable. But please note that 'Change
           password' or 'Reset password' permissions or similar might be
           needed to make the LDAP operation work. Additionally there will be
           no read-only domain controller (RODC) support as there is with
           Kerberos.

       If supported on the AD side the msDS-supportedEncryptionTypes attribute
       will be set as well. Either the current value or the default list of
       AD's supported encryption types filtered by the permitted encryption
       types of the client's Kerberos configuration are written.

UPDATING THE MACHINE ACCOUNT PASSWORD AND OTHER ATTRIBUTES
       adcli update updates the password of the computer account on the domain
       controller for the local machine, write the new keys to the keytab and
       removes older keys. It keeps the previous key on purpose because AD
       will need some time to replicate the new key to all DCs hence the
       previous key might still be used.

           $ adcli update

       If used with a credential cache, other attributes of the computer
       account can be changed as well if the principal has sufficient
       privileges.

           $ kinit Administrator
           $ adcli update --login-ccache=/tmp/krbcc_123

       In addition to the global options, you can specify the following
       options to control how this operation is done.

       -N, --computer-name=computer
           The short non-dotted name of the computer account that will be
           created in the domain. If not specified, it will be retrieved from
           the keytab entries.

       -H, --host-fqdn=host
           The local machine's fully qualified domain name. If not specified,
           the local machine's hostname will be retrieved from the keytab
           entries.

       -K, --host-keytab=/path/to/keytab
           Specify the path to the host keytab where current host credentials
           are stored and the new ones will be written to. If not specified,
           the default location will be used, usually /etc/krb5.keytab.

       --os-name=name
           Set the operating system name on the computer account. Not set by
           default.

       --os-service-pack=pack
           Set the operating system service pack on the computer account. Not
           set by default.

       --os-version=version
           Set the operating system version on the computer account. Not set
           by default.

       --description=description
           Set the description attribute on the computer account. Not set by
           default.

       --service-name=service
           Additional service name for a Kerberos principal to be created on
           the computer account. This option may be specified multiple times.

       --user-principal=host/name@REALM
           Set the userPrincipalName field of the computer account to this
           Kerberos principal.

       --computer-password-lifetime=lifetime
           Only update the password of the computer account if it is older
           than the lifetime given in days. By default the password is updated
           if it is older than 30 days.

       --trusted-for-delegation=yes|no|true|false
           Set or unset the TRUSTED_FOR_DELEGATION flag in the
           userAccountControl attribute to allow or not allow that Kerberos
           tickets can be forwarded to the host.

       --dont-expire-password=yes|no|true|false
           Set or unset the DONT_EXPIRE_PASSWORD flag in the
           userAccountControl attribute to indicate if the machine account
           password should expire or not. By default adcli will set this flag
           while joining the domain which corresponds to the default behavior
           of Windows clients.

           Please note that if the password will expire
           (--dont-expire-password=false) a renewal mechanism has to be
           enabled on the client to not loose the connectivity to AD if the
           password expires.

       --account-disable=yes|no|true|false
           Set or unset the ACCOUNTDISABLE flag in the userAccountControl
           attribute to disable or enable the computer account.

       --add-service-principal=service/hostname
           Add a service principal name. In contrast to the --service-name the
           hostname part can be specified as well in case the service should
           be accessible with a different host name as well.

       --remove-service-principal=service/hostname
           Remove a service principal name from the keytab and the AD host
           object.

       --setattr=name=value
           Add the LDAP attribute name with the given value to the LDAP host
           object. This option can be used multiple times to add multiple
           different attributes. Multi-value attributes are currently not
           supported.

           Please note that the account used to update the host object must
           have the required privileges to modify the given attributes. Some
           attributes might have constraints with respect to syntax and
           allowed values which must be met as well. Attributes managed by
           other adcli options cannot be set with this option.

       --delattr=name
           Remove the LDAP attribute name from the LDAP host object. This
           option can be used multiple times to remove multiple different
           attributes.

           Please note that the account used to update the host object must
           have the required privileges to delete the given attributes.
           Attributes managed by other adcli options cannot be removed.

       --show-details
           After a successful join print out information about join operation.
           This is output in a format that should be both human and machine
           readable.

       --add-samba-data
           After a successful join add the domain SID and the machine account
           password to the Samba specific databases by calling Samba's net
           utility.

           Please note that Samba's net requires some settings in smb.conf to
           create the database entries correctly. Most important here is
           currently the workgroup option, see smb.conf(5) for details.

           Note that if the machine account password is not older than 30
           days, you have to pass --computer-password-lifetime=0 to force the
           update.

       --samba-data-tool=/path/to/net
           If Samba's net cannot be found at /usr/bin/net, this option can be
           used to specific an alternative location with the help of an
           absolute path.

       --ldap-passwd
           Use LDAP add/mod operations to set the machine account password
           instead of Kerberos. This might help in some situations where
           Kerberos fails or is unreliable. But please note that 'Change
           password' or 'Rest password' permissions or similar might be needed
           to make the LDAP operation work. Additionally there will be no
           read-only domain controller (RODC) support as there is with
           Kerberos.

       If supported on the AD side the msDS-supportedEncryptionTypes attribute
       will be set as well. Either the current value or the default list of
       AD's supported encryption types filtered by the permitted encryption
       types of the client's Kerberos configuration are written.

TESTING IF THE MACHINE ACCOUNT PASSWORD IS VALID
       adcli testjoin uses the current credentials in the keytab and tries to
       authenticate with the machine account to the AD domain. If this works
       the machine account password and the join are still valid. If it fails
       the machine account password or the whole machine account have to be
       refreshed with adcli join or adcli update.

           $ adcli testjoin

       Only the global options not related to authentication are available,
       additionally you can specify the following options to control how this
       operation is done.

       -K, --host-keytab=/path/to/keytab
           Specify the path to the host keytab where current host credentials
           are stored and the new ones will be written to. If not specified,
           the default location will be used, usually /etc/krb5.keytab.

CREATING A USER
       adcli create-user creates a new user account in the domain.

           $ adcli create-user Fry --domain=domain.example.com \
                --display-name="Philip J. Fry" --mail=fry@domain.example.com

       In addition to the global options, you can specify the following
       options to control how the user is created.

       --display-name="Name"
           Set the displayName attribute of the new created user account.

       -O, --domain-ou=OU=xxx
           The full distinguished name of the OU in which to create the user
           account. If not specified, then the computer account will be
           created in a default location.

       --mail=email@domain.com
           Set the mail attribute of the new created user account. This
           attribute may be specified multiple times.

       --unix-home=/home/user
           Set the unixHomeDirectory attribute of the new created user
           account, which should be an absolute path to the user's home
           directory.

       --unix-gid=111
           Set the gidNumber attribute of the new created user account, which
           should be the user's numeric primary group id.

       --unix-shell=/bin/shell
           Set the loginShell attribute of the new created user account, which
           should be a path to a valid shell.

       --unix-uid=111
           Set the uidNumber attribute of the new created user account, which
           should be the user's numeric primary user id.

       --nis-domain=nis_domain
           Set the msSFU30NisDomain attribute of the new created user account,
           which should be the user's NIS domain is the NIS/YP service of
           Active Directory's Services for Unix (SFU) are used. This is needed
           to let the 'UNIX attributes' tab of older Active Directory versions
           show the set UNIX specific attributes. If not specified adcli will
           try to determine the NIS domain automatically if needed.

DELETING A USER
       adcli delete-user deletes a user account from the domain.

           $ adcli delete-user Fry --domain=domain.example.com

       The various global options can be used.

(RE)SETTING THE PASSWORD OF A USER WITH AN ADMINISTRATIVE ACCOUNT
       adcli passwd-user sets or resets the password of user account. The
       administrative account used for this operation must have privileges to
       set a password.

           $ adcli passwd-user Fry --domain=domain.example.com

       The various global options can be used.

CREATING A GROUP
       adcli create-group creates a new group in the domain.

           $ adcli create-group Pilots --domain=domain.example.com \
                --description="Group for all pilots"

       In addition to the global options, you can specify the following
       options to control how the group is created.

       --description="text"
           Set the description attribute of the new created group.

       -O, --domain-ou=OU=xxx
           The full distinguished name of the OU in which to create the group.
           If not specified, then the group will be created in a default
           location.

DELETING A GROUP
       adcli delete-group deletes a group from the domain.

           $ adcli delete-group Pilots --domain=domain.example.com

       The various global options can be used.

ADDING A MEMBER TO A GROUP
       adcli add-member adds one or more users to a group in the domain. The
       group is specified first, and then the various users or computers to be
       added. You must use dollar sign for computer account (computername$)

           $ adcli add-member --domain=domain.example.com Pilots Leela Scruffy
           $ adcli add-member --domain=domain.example.com servers srv-smb$

       The various global options can be used.

REMOVING A MEMBER FROM A GROUP
       adcli remove-member removes a user from a group in the domain. The
       group is specified first, and then the various users to be removed.

           $ adcli remove-member --domain=domain.example.com Pilots Scruffy

       The various global options can be used.

PRESET COMPUTER ACCOUNTS
       adcli preset-computer pre-creates one or more computer accounts in the
       domain for machines to later use when joining the domain. By doing this
       machines can join using a one time password or automatically without a
       password.

           $ adcli preset-computer --domain=domain.example.com \
                host1.example.com host2
           Password for Administrator:

       If the computer names specified contain dots, then they are treated as
       fully qualified host names, otherwise they are treated as short
       computer names. The computer accounts must not already exist.

       In addition to the global options, you can specify the following
       options to control how this operation is done.

       -O, --domain-ou=OU=xxx
           The full distinguished name of the OU in which to create the
           computer accounts. If not specified, then the computer account will
           be created in a default location.

       --one-time-password
           Specify a one time password to use when presetting the computer
           accounts. If not specified, then a default password will be used,
           which allows for later automatic joins.

       --os-name=name
           Set the operating system name on the computer account. The default
           depends on where adcli was built, but is usually something like
           'linux-gnu'.

       --os-service-pack=pack
           Set the operating system service pack on the computer account. Not
           set by default.

       --os-version=version
           Set the operating system version on the computer account. Not set
           by default.

       --service-name=service
           Additional service name for a Kerberos principal to be created on
           the computer account. This option may be specified multiple times.

       --user-principal
           Set the userPrincipalName field of the computer account to this
           Kerberos principal in the form of host/host.example.com@REALM

RESET COMPUTER ACCOUNT
       adcli reset-computer resets a computer account in the domain. If the
       appropriate machine is currently joined to the domain, then its
       membership will be broken. The account must already exist.

           $ adcli reset-computer --domain=domain.example.com host2

       If the computer names specified contain dots, then they are treated as
       fully qualified host names, otherwise they are treated as short
       computer names.

       In addition to the global options, you can specify the following
       options to control how this operation is done.

       --login-type={computer|user}
           Specify the type of authentication that will be performed before
           creating the machine account in the domain. If set to 'computer',
           then the computer must already have a preset account in the domain.
           If not specified and none of the other --login-xxx arguments have
           been specified, then will try both 'computer' and 'user'
           authentication.

DELETE COMPUTER ACCOUNT
       adcli delete-computer deletes a computer account in the domain. The
       account must already exist.

           $ adcli delete-computer --domain=domain.example.com host2
           Password for Administrator:

       If the computer name contains a dot, then it is treated as fully
       qualified host name, otherwise it is treated as short computer name.

       If no computer name is specified, then the host name of the computer
       adcli is running on is used, as returned by gethostname().

       The various global options can be used.

SHOW COMPUTER ACCOUNT ATTRIBUTES
       adcli show-computer show the computer account attributes stored in AD.
       The account must already exist.

           $ adcli show-computer --domain=domain.example.com host2
           Password for Administrator:

       If the computer name contains a dot, then it is treated as fully
       qualified host name, otherwise it is treated as short computer name.

       If no computer name is specified, then the host name of the computer
       adcli is running on is used, as returned by gethostname().

       The various global options can be used.

CREATE A MANAGED SERVICE ACCOUNT
       adcli create-msa creates a managed service account (MSA) in the given
       Active Directory domain. This is useful if a computer should not fully
       join the Active Directory domain but LDAP access is needed. A typical
       use case is that the computer is already joined an Active Directory
       domain and needs access to another Active Directory domain in the same
       or a trusted forest where the host credentials from the joined Active
       Directory domain are not valid, e.g. there is only a one-way trust.

           $ adcli create-msa --domain=domain.example.com
           Password for Administrator:

       The managed service account, as maintained by adcli, cannot have
       additional service principals names (SPNs) associated with it. An SPN
       is defined within the context of a Kerberos service which is tied to a
       machine account in Active Directory. Since a machine can be joined to a
       single Active Directory domain, managed service account in a different
       Active Directory domain will not have the SPNs that otherwise are part
       of another Active Directory domain's machine.

       Since it is expected that a client will most probably join to the
       Active Directory domain matching its DNS domain the managed service
       account will be needed for a different Active Directory domain and as a
       result the Active Directory domain name is a mandatory option. If
       called with no other options adcli create-msa will use the short
       hostname with an additional random suffix as computer name to avoid
       name collisions.

       LDAP attribute sAMAccountName has a limit of 20 characters. However,
       machine account's NetBIOS name must be at most 16 characters long,
       including a trailing '$' sign. Since it is not expected that the
       managed service accounts created by adcli will be used on the NetBIOS
       level the remaining 4 characters can be used to add uniqueness. Managed
       service account names will have a suffix of 3 random characters from
       number and upper- and lowercase ASCII ranges appended to the chosen
       short host name, using '!' as a separator. For a host with the
       shortname 'myhost', a managed service account will have a common name
       (CN attribute) 'myhost!A2c' and a NetBIOS name (sAMAccountName
       attribute) will be 'myhost!A2c$'. A corresponding Kerberos principal in
       the Active Directory domain where the managed service account was
       created would be 'myhost!A2c$@DOMAIN.EXAMPLE.COM'.

       A keytab for the managed service account is stored into a file
       specified with -K option. If it is not specified, the file is named
       after the default keytab file, with lowercase Active Directory domain
       of the managed service account as a suffix. On most systems it would be
       /etc/krb5.keytab with a suffix of 'domain.example.com', e.g.
       /etc/krb5.keytab.domain.example.com.

       adcli create-msa can be called multiple times to reset the password of
       the managed service account. To identify the right account with the
       random component in the name the corresponding principal is read from
       the keytab. If the keytab got deleted adcli will try to identify an
       existing managed service account with the help of the fully-qualified
       name, if this fails a new managed service account will be created.

       The managed service account password can be updated with

           $ adcli update --domain=domain.example.com --host-keytab=/etc/krb5.keytab.domain.example.com

       and the managed service account can be deleted with

           $ adcli delete-computer --domain=domain.example.com 'myhost!A2c'

       In addition to the global options, you can specify the following
       options to control how this operation is done.

       -N, --computer-name=computer
           The short non-dotted name of the managed service account that will
           be created in the Active Directory domain. The long option name
           --computer-name is kept to underline the similarity with the same
           option of the other sub-commands. If not specified, then the first
           portion of the --host-fqdn or its default is used with a random
           suffix.

       -O, --domain-ou=OU=xxx
           The full distinguished name of the OU in which to create the
           managed service account. If not specified, then the managed service
           account will be created in a default location.

       -H, --host-fqdn=host
           Override the local machine's fully qualified DNS domain name. If
           not specified, the local machine's hostname will be retrieved via
           gethostname(). If gethostname() only returns a short name
           getaddrinfo() with the AI_CANONNAME hint is called to expand the
           name to a fully qualified DNS domain name.

       -K, --host-keytab=/path/to/keytab
           Specify the path to the host keytab where credentials of the
           managed service account will be written after a successful
           creation. If not specified, the default location will be used,
           usually /etc/krb5.keytab with the lower-cased Active Directory
           domain name added as a suffix e.g.
           /etc/krb5.keytab.domain.example.com.

       --show-details
           After a successful creation print out information about the created
           object. This is output in a format that should be both human and
           machine readable.

       --show-password
           After a successful creation print out the managed service account
           password. This is output in a format that should be both human and
           machine readable.

DELEGATED PERMISSIONS
       It is common practice in AD to not use an account from the Domain
       Administrators group to join a machine to a domain but use a dedicated
       account which only has permissions to join a machine to one or more OUs
       in the Active Directory tree. Giving the needed permissions to a single
       account or a group in Active Directory is called Delegation. A typical
       example on how to configured Delegation can be found in the Delegation
       section of the blog post Who can add workstation to the domain[1].

       When using an account with delegated permissions with adcli basically
       the same applies as well. However some aspects are explained here in a
       bit more details to better illustrate different concepts of Active
       Directory and to make it more easy to debug permissions issues during
       the join. Please note that the following is not specific to adcli but
       applies to all applications which would like to modify certain
       properties or objects in Active Directory with an account with limited
       permissions.

       First, as said in the blog post it is sufficient to have "Create
       computer object" permissions to join a computer to a domain. But this
       would only work as expected if the computer object does not exist in
       Active Directory before the join. Because only when a new object is
       created Active Directory does not apply additional permission checks on
       the attributes of the new computer object. This means the delegated
       user can add any kind of attribute with any value to a new computer
       object also long as they meet general constraints like e.g. that the
       attribute must be defined in the schema and is allowed in a objectclass
       of the object, the value must match the syntax defined in the schema or
       that the sAMAccountName must be unique in the domain.

       If you want to use the account with delegated permission to remove
       computer objects in Active Directory (adcli delete-computer) you should
       of course make sure that the account has "Delete computer object"
       permissions.

       If the computer object already exists the "Create computer object"
       permission does not apply anymore since now an existing object must be
       modified. Now permissions on the individual attributes are needed. e.g.
       "Read and write Account Restrictions" or "Reset Password". For some
       attributes Active Directory has two types of permissions the plain
       "Read and Write" permissions and the "Validated Write" permissions. For
       the latter case there are two specific permissions relevant for adcli,
       namely

       •   Validated write to DNS host name

       •   Validated write to service principal name

       Details about the validation of the values can be found in the
       "Validated Writes" section of [MS-ADTS], especially dNSHostName[2] and
       servicePrincipalName[3]. To cut it short for "Validated write to DNS
       host name" the domain part of the fully-qualified hostname must either
       match the domain name of the domain you want to join to or must be
       listed in the msDS-AllowedDNSSuffixes attribute. And for "Validated
       write to service principal name" the hostname part of the service
       principal name must match the name stored in dNSHostName or some other
       attributes which are not handled by adcli. This also means that
       dNSHostName cannot be empty or only contain a short name if the service
       principal name should contain a fully-qualified name.

       To summarize, if you only have validated write permissions you should
       make sure the domain part of the hostname matches the domain you want
       to join or use the --host-fqdn with a matching name.

       The plain read write permissions do not run additional validations but
       the attribute values must still be in agreement with the general
       constraints mentioned above. If the computer object already exists
       adcli might need the following permissions which are also needed by
       Windows clients to modify existing attributes:

       •   Reset Password

       •   Read and write Account Restrictions

       •   Read and (validated) write to DNS host name

       •   Read and (validated) write to service principal name

       additionally adcli needs

       •   Read and write msDS-supportedEncryptionTypes

       This is added for security reasons to avoid that Active Directory
       stores Kerberos keys with (potentially weaker) encryption types than
       the client supports since Active Directory is often configured to still
       support older (weaker) encryption types for compatibility reasons.

       All other attributes are only set or modified on demand, i.e. adcli
       must be called with an option the would set or modify the given
       attribute. In the following the attributes adcli can modify together
       with the required permissions are listed:

       •   userPrincipalName

           •   Read/Write userPrincipal Name

       •   msDS-supportedEncryptionTypes

           •   Read/Write msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes

       •   dNSHostName

           •   Read/Write dNSHostName

           •   Read and write DNS host name attributes

           •   Validated write to DNS host name

       •   servicePrincipalName

           •   Read/Write servicePrincipalName

           •   Validated write to service principal name

       •   operatingSystem

           •   Read/Write Operating System

       •   operatingSystemVersion

           •   Read/Write Operating System Version

       •   operatingSystemServicePack

           •   Read/Write operatingSystemServicePack

       •   userAccountControl

           •   Read/Write userAccountControl

       •   description

           •   Read/Write Description

       For the management of users and groups (adcli create-user, adcli
       delete-user, adcli create-group, adcli delete-group) the same applies
       only for different types of objects, i.e. users and groups. Since
       currently adcli only supports the creation and the removal of user and
       group objects it is sufficient to have the "Create/Delete User objects"
       and "Create/Delete Group objects" permissions.

       If you want to manage group members as well (adcli add-member, adcli
       remove-member) "Read/Write Members" permissions are needed as well.

       Depending on the version of Active Directory the "Delegation of Control
       Wizard" might offer some shortcuts for common task like e.g.

       •   Create, delete and manage user accounts

       •   Create, delete and manage groups

       •   Modify the membership of a group

       The first 2 shortcuts will provided full access to user and group
       objects which, as explained above, is more than currently is needed.
       After using those shortcut it is a good idea to verify in the
       "Security" tab in the "Properties" of the related Active Directory
       container that the assigned permissions meet the expectations.
