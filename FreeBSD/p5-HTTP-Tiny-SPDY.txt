NAME
       HTTP::Tiny::SPDY - A subclass of HTTP::Tiny with SPDY support

VERSION
       version 0.020

SYNOPSIS
           use HTTP::Tiny::SPDY;

           my $response = HTTP::Tiny::SPDY->new->get('https://example.com/');

           die "Failed!\n" unless $response->{success};

           print "$response->{status} $response->{reason}\n";

           while (my ($k, $v) = each %{$response->{headers}}) {
               for (ref $v eq 'ARRAY' ? @$v : $v) {
                   print "$k: $_\n";
               }
           }

           print $response->{content} if length $response->{content};

DESCRIPTION
       This is a subclass of HTTP::Tiny with added support for the SPDY
       protocol. It is intended to be fully compatible with HTTP::Tiny so that
       it can be used as a drop-in replacement for it.

METHODS
   new
           $http = HTTP::Tiny::SPDY->new( %attributes );

       Constructor that returns a new HTTP::Tiny::SPDY object. It accepts the
       same attributes as the constructor of HTTP::Tiny, and one additional
       attribute:

       •   "enable_SPDY"

           A boolean that indicates if a SPDY connection should be negotiated
           for HTTPS requests (default is true)
