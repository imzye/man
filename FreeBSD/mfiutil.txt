DESCRIPTION
     The mfiutil utility can be used to display or modify various parameters
     on LSI MegaRAID SAS RAID controllers.  Each invocation of mfiutil
     consists of zero or more global options followed by a command.  Commands
     may support additional optional or required arguments after the command.

     Currently one global option is supported:

     -u unit
             unit specifies the unit of the controller to work with.  If no
             unit is specified, then unit 0 is used.

     Various commands accept either or both of the two options:

     -d      Print numeric device IDs as drive identifier.  This is the
             default.  Useful in combination with -e to print both, numeric
             device IDs and enclosure:slot information.

     -e      Print drive identifiers in enclosure:slot form.  See next
             paragraph on format details in context of input rather than
             output.

     Drives may be specified in two forms.  First, a drive may be identified
     by its device ID.  The device ID for configured drives can be found in
     show config.  Second, a drive may be identified by its location as
     [Exx:]Syy where xx is the enclosure and yy is the slot for each drive as
     displayed in show drives.

     Volumes may be specified in two forms.  First, a volume may be identified
     by its target ID.  Second, on the volume may be specified by the
     corresponding mfidX device, such as mfid0.

     The mfiutil utility supports several different groups of commands.  The
     first group of commands provide information about the controller, the
     volumes it manages, and the drives it controls.  The second group of
     commands are used to manage the physical drives attached to the
     controller.  The third group of commands are used to manage the logical
     volumes managed by the controller.  The fourth group of commands are used
     to manage the drive configuration for the controller.  The fifth group of
     commands are used to manage controller-wide operations.

     The informational commands include:

     version
             Displays the version of mfiutil.

     show adapter
             Displays information about the RAID controller such as the model
             number.

     show battery
             Displays information about the battery from the battery backup
             unit.

     show config
             Displays the volume and drive configuration for the controller.
             Each array is listed along with the physical drives the array is
             built from.  Each volume is listed along with the arrays that the
             volume spans.  If any hot spare drives are configured, then they
             are listed as well.

     show drives
             Lists all of the physical drives attached to the controller.

     show events [-c class] [-l locale] [-n count] [-v] [start [stop]]
             Display entries from the controller's event log.  The controller
             maintains a circular buffer of events.  Each event is tagged with
             a class and locale.

             The class parameter limits the output to entries at the specified
             class or higher.  The default class is “warn”.  The available
             classes from lowest priority to highest are:

             debug   Debug messages.

             progress
                     Periodic progress updates for long-running operations
                     such as background initializations, array rebuilds, or
                     patrol reads.

             info    Informational messages such as drive insertions and
                     volume creations.

             warn    Indicates that some component may be close to failing.

             crit    A component has failed, but no data is lost.  For
                     example, a volume becoming degraded due to a drive
                     failure.

             fatal   A component has failed resulting in data loss.

             dead    The controller itself has died.

             The locale parameter limits the output to entries for the
             specified part of the controller.  The default locale is “all”.
             The available locales are “volume”, “drive”, “enclosure”,
             “battery”, “sas”, “controller”, “config”, “cluster”, and “all”.

             The count parameter is a debugging aid that specifies the number
             of events to fetch from the controller for each low-level
             request.  The default is 15 events.

             By default, matching event log entries from the previous shutdown
             up to the present are displayed.  This range can be adjusted via
             the start and stop parameters.  Each of these parameters can
             either be specified as a log entry number or as one of the
             following aliases:

             newest  The newest entry in the event log.

             oldest  The oldest entry in the event log.

             clear   The first entry since the event log was cleared.

             shutdown
                     The entry in the event log corresponding to the last time
                     the controller was cleanly shut down.

             boot    The entry in the event log corresponding to the most
                     recent boot.

     show firmware
             Lists all of the firmware images present on the controller.

     show foreign
             Displays detected foreign configurations on disks for importation
             or removal.

     show logstate
             Display the various sequence numbers associated with the event
             log.

     show patrol
             Display the status of the controller's patrol read operation.

     show progress
             Report the current progress and estimated completion time for
             active operations on all volumes and drives.

     show volumes
             Lists all of the logical volumes managed by the controller.

     The physical drive management commands include:

     fail drive
             Mark drive as failed.  Drive must be an online drive that is part
             of an array.

     good drive
             Mark drive as an unconfigured good drive.  Drive must not be part
             of an existing array.

     rebuild drive
             Mark a failed drive that is still part of an array as a good
             drive suitable for a rebuild.  The firmware should kick off an
             array rebuild on its own if a failed drive is marked as a rebuild
             drive.

     syspd drive
             Present the drive to the host operating system as a disk SYSPD
             block device in the format /dev/mfisyspdX.  Clear this flag with
             good drive

     drive progress drive
             Report the current progress and estimated completion time of
             drive operations such as rebuilds or patrol reads.

     drive clear drive {start | stop}
             Start or stop the writing of all 0x00 characters to a drive.

     start rebuild drive
             Manually start a rebuild on drive.

     abort rebuild drive
             Abort an in-progress rebuild operation on drive.  It can be
             resumed with the start rebuild command.

     locate drive {on | off}
             Change the state of the external LED associated with drive.

     The logical volume management commands include:

     cache volume [setting [value] [...]]
             If no setting arguments are supplied, then the current cache
             policy for volume is displayed; otherwise, the cache policy for
             volume is modified.  One or more setting arguments may be given.
             Some settings take an additional value argument as noted below.
             The valid settings are:

             enable  Enable caching for both read and write I/O operations.

             disable
                     Disable caching for both read and write I/O operations.

             reads   Enable caching only for read I/O operations.

             writes  Enable caching only for write I/O operations.

             write-back
                     Use write-back policy for cached writes.

             write-through
                     Use write-through policy for cached writes.

             read-ahead value
                     Set the read ahead policy for cached reads.  The value
                     argument can be set to either “none”, “adaptive”, or
                     “always”.

             bad-bbu-write-cache value
                     Control the behavior of I/O write caching if the battery
                     is dead or missing.  The value argument can be set to
                     either “disable” or “enable”.  In general this setting
                     should be left disabled to avoid data loss when the
                     system loses power.

             write-cache value
                     Control the write caches on the physical drives backing
                     volume.  The value argument can be set to either
                     “disable”, “enable”, or “default”.

                     In general this setting should be left disabled to avoid
                     data loss when the physical drives lose power.  The
                     battery backup of the RAID controller does not save data
                     in the write caches of the physical drives.

     name volume name
             Sets the name of volume to name.

     volume progress volume
             Report the current progress and estimated completion time of
             volume operations such as consistency checks and initializations.

     The configuration commands include:

     clear   Delete the entire configuration including all volumes, arrays,
             and spares.

     create type [-v] [-s stripe_size] drive[,drive[,...]]
             [drive[,drive[,...]]]
             Create a new volume.  The type specifies the type of volume to
             create.  Currently supported types include:

             jbod    Creates a RAID0 volume for each drive specified.  Each
                     drive must be specified as a separate argument.

             raid0   Creates one RAID0 volume spanning the drives listed in
                     the single drive list.

             raid1   Creates one RAID1 volume spanning the drives listed in
                     the single drive list.

             raid5   Creates one RAID5 volume spanning the drives listed in
                     the single drive list.

             raid6   Creates one RAID6 volume spanning the drives listed in
                     the single drive list.

             raid10  Creates one RAID10 volume spanning multiple RAID1 arrays.
                     The drives for each RAID1 array are specified as a single
                     drive list.

             raid50  Creates one RAID50 volume spanning multiple RAID5 arrays.
                     The drives for each RAID5 array are specified as a single
                     drive list.

             raid60  Creates one RAID60 volume spanning multiple RAID6 arrays.
                     The drives for each RAID6 array are specified as a single
                     drive list.

             concat  Creates a single volume by concatenating all of the
                     drives in the single drive list.

             Note: Not all volume types are supported by all controllers.

             If the -v flag is specified after type, then more verbose output
             will be enabled.  Currently this just provides notification as
             drives are added to arrays and arrays to volumes when building
             the configuration.

             The -s stripe_size parameter allows the stripe size of the array
             to be set.  By default a stripe size of 64K is used.  Valid
             values are 512 through 1M, though the MFI firmware may reject
             some values.

     delete volume
             Delete the volume volume.

     add drive [volume]
             Mark drive as a hot spare.  Drive must be in the unconfigured
             good state.  If volume is specified, then the hot spare will be
             dedicated to arrays backing that volume.  Otherwise, drive will
             be used as a global hot spare backing all arrays for this
             controller.  Note that drive must be as large as the smallest
             drive in all of the arrays it is going to back.

     remove drive
             Remove the hot spare drive from service.  It will be placed in
             the unconfigured good state.

     The controller management commands include:

     patrol command [interval [start]]
             Set the patrol read operation mode.  The command argument can be
             one of the following values:

             disable
                     Disable patrol reads.

             auto    Enable periodic patrol reads initiated by the firmware.
                     The optional interval argument specifies the interval in
                     seconds between patrol reads.  If patrol reads should be
                     run continuously, then interval should consist of the
                     word “continuously”.  The optional start argument
                     specifies a non-negative, relative start time for the
                     next patrol read.  If an interval or start time is not
                     specified, then the existing setting will be used.

             manual  Enable manual patrol reads that are only initiated by the
                     user.

     start patrol
             Start a patrol read operation.

     stop patrol
             Stop a currently running patrol read operation.

     foreign scan
             Scan for foreign configurations and display the number found. The
             config argument for the commands below takes the form of a number
             from 0 to the total configurations found.

     foreign clear [config]
             Clear the specified foreign config or all if no config argument
             is provided.

     foreign diag [config]
             Display a diagnostic display of the specified foreign config or
             all if no config argument is provided.

     foreign preview [config]
             Preview the specified foreign config after import or all if no
             config argument is provided.

     foreign import [config]
             Import the specified foreign config or all if no config argument
             is provided.

     flash file
             Updates the flash on the controller with the firmware stored in
             file.  A reboot is required for the new firmware to take effect.

     start learn
             Start a battery relearn.  Note that this seems to always result
             in the battery being completely drained, regardless of the BBU
             mode.  In particular, the controller write cache will be disabled
             during the relearn even if transparent learning mode is enabled.

     bbu setting value
             Update battery backup unit (BBU) properties related to battery
             relearning.  The following settings are configurable:

             learn-delay
                     Add a delay to the next scheduled battery relearn event.
                     This setting is given in hours and must lie in the range
                     of 0 to 255.

             autolearn-mode
                     Enable or disable automatic periodic battery relearning.
                     The setting may be set to “enable” or “disable” to
                     respectively enable or disable the relearn cycle.
                     Alternatively, a mode of 0, 1 or 2 may be given.  Mode 0
                     enables periodic relearning, mode 1 disables it, and mode
                     2 disables it and logs a warning to the event log when it
                     detects that a battery relearn should be performed.

             bbu-mode
                     Set the BBU's mode of operation. This setting is not
                     supported by all BBUs.  Where it is supported, the
                     possible values are the integers between 1 and 5
                     inclusive.  Modes 1, 2 and 3 enable a transparent learn
                     cycle, whereas modes 4 and 5 do not.  The BBU's data
                     retention time is greater when transparent learning is
                     not used.

     ctrlprop rebuild [rate]
             With no arguments display the rate of rebuild (percentage)a for
             volumes.  With an integer argument (0-100), set that value as the
             new rebuild rate for volumes.

     ctrlprop alarm [0/1]
             With no arguments display the current alarm enable/disable
             status.  With a 0, disable alarms.  With a 1, enable alarms.

EXAMPLES
     Configure the cache for volume mfid0 to cache only writes:

           mfiutil cache mfid0 writes
           mfiutil cache mfid0 write-back

     Create a RAID5 array spanning the first four disks in the second
     enclosure:

           mfiutil create raid5 e1:s0,e1:s1,e1:s2,e1:s4

     Configure the first three disks on a controller as JBOD:

           mfiutil create jbod 0 1 2

     Create a RAID10 volume that spans two arrays each of which contains two
     disks from two different enclosures:

           mfiutil create raid10 e1:s0,e1:s1 e2:s0,e2:s1

     Add drive with the device ID of 4 as a global hot spare:

           mfiutil add 4

     Add the drive in slot 2 in the main chassis as a hot spare for volume
     mfid0:

           mfiutil add s2 mfid0

     Reconfigure a disk as a SYSPD block device with no RAID

           mfiutil syspd 0

     Configure the adapter to run periodic patrol reads once a week with the
     first patrol read starting in 5 minutes:

           mfiutil patrol auto 604800 300

     Display the second detected foreign configuration:

           mfiutil show foreign 1

     Set the current rebuild rate for volumes to 40%:
           mfiutil ctrlprop rebuild 40
