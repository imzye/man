BDFRESIZE(1)            FreeBSD General Commands Manual           BDFRESIZE(1)

NAME
       bdfresize - Resize BDF Format Font

SYNOPSIS
       bdfresize [-v] [-b number] [-[whf] factor] [bdf-file]

DESCRIPTION
       Bdfresize is a command to magnify or reduce fonts which are described
       with the standard BDF format.  If bdf-file is not specified, it reads
       from stdin.  Bdfresize outputs the result to stdout in BDF format.
       Some COMMENT lines are inserted to the result font.  FONT name is
       modified depending on the resize factor if the name is described in
       XLFD format.  SIZE, FONTBOUNDINGBIX, SWIDTH, DWIDTH, BBX and some
       property lines are also modified.  Other lines are copied from source.
       If a syntax error occurs in a source font, bdfresize notices it and
       stops the whole process.

OPTIONS
       -v      Show the version number and exit.

       -b number
               Specify the blackness.  Pixel values of a resized font are
               decided by this value.  Default is 4.

       -w factor
               Specify the resize factor for the font width.

       -h factor
               Specify the resize factor for the font height.

       -f factor
               Same as ``-w factor -h factor''.

       factor is described in either of following forms.
            <digits>
            <digits>/<digits>
