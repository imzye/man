Test::Data(3)         User Contributed Perl Documentation        Test::Data(3)


NAME
       Test::Data -- test functions for particular variable types

SYNOPSIS
       use Test::Data qw(Scalar Array Hash Function);

DESCRIPTION
       Test::Data provides utility functions to check properties and values of
       data and variables.

   Functions
       Plug-in modules define functions for each data type.  See the
       appropriate module.

   How it works
       The Test::Data module simply emports functions from Test::Data::*
       modules.  Each module defines a self-contained function, and puts that
       function name into @EXPORT.  Test::Data defines its own import
       function, but that does not matter to the plug-in modules.

       If you want to write a plug-in module, follow the example of one that
       already exists.   Name the module Test::Data::Foo, where you replace
       Foo with the right name.  Test::Data should automatically find it.

BUGS
       I'm not a very good Windows Perler, so some things don't work as they
       should on Windows. I recently got a Windows box so I can test things,
       but if you run into problems, I can use all the patches or advice you
       care to send.
