NAME
       Calcoo - scientific calculator (GTK+).

SYNOPSIS
       calcoo [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       Calcoo is a scientific calculator designed to provide maximum
       usability. The features that make Calcoo attractive are:

       *      bitmapped button labels and display digits to improve
              readability

       *      no double-function buttons - you need to click only one button
              for any operation (except for arc-hyp trigonometric functions)

       *      undo/redo buttons

       *      both RPN and algebraic modes

       *      display marks to separate thousands

       *      copy/paste interaction with the X clipboard

       *      two memory registers with displays

       *      displays for Y, Z, and T registers

OPERATION
       Like in a regular calculator. Settings (switching between RPN and
       algebraic modes, rounding, RPN stack behavior) can be accessed by
       pressing the button labelled "!". The button labelled "?" brings up the
       help/info window.
