NAME
       PostScript::PPD - Read PostScript Printer Definition files

SYNOPSIS
           use PostScript::PPD;

           my $ppd = PostScript::PPD->new( $file );

           print "Maker: ", $ppd->Manufacturer, "\n",
                 "Mode: ", $ppd->ModelName;

           # Also:
           print "Maker: ", $ppd->get( 'Manufacturer' ), "\n",
                 "Mode: ", $ppd->get( 'ModelName' );

           # Get a list of UI groups
           my @groups = $ppd->Groups;

           # Get one UI group
           my $G = $ppd->Group( $groups[0] );

           # Get a list of UI options in that group
           my @UIs = $G->UIs;

           # Get one UI option
           my $ui = $G->UI( $UIs[0] );

           print "Default $groups[0] $UIs[0]: ", $ui->default;

ABSTRACT
       PostScript::PPD reads and parses PostScript Printer Definition files,
       called PPDs.

DESCRIPTION
       PostScript::PPD reads and parses PostScript Printer Definition files,
       called PPDs.

       PPDs contain key/value tuples that describe the printer, its
       capabilities and the printing options available.  The printing options
       are classified as User Interface (UI) options, which are grouped into
       groups.

       I huge database of PPDs is available from
       <http://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/OpenPrinting/Database/Foomatic>.

   Schema
       A PPD is a series of key/value pairs in two groups.  The first group
       provides information about the printer and some of its features.  The
       second group describe all the options that the PPD provides, as well as
       an organised UI for setting them.  This UI is organised into a
       hierarchy :

           Group1
               Option1
                   key1: value
                   key2: value
               Option2
                   key1: value
                   key2: value
           Group2
               OtherOption1
                   key1: value
                   key2: value

       A value can be a block of PostScript, to be executed on the printer, or
       a value to be passed to "lp -o".

       Very simple example:

           *OpenGroup: General/General
           *OpenUI *PageSize/Page Size: PickOne
           *OrderDependency: 100 AnySetup *PageSize
           *DefaultPageSize: Letter
           *PageSize Letter/US Letter: "<</PageSize[612 792]/ImagingBBox null>>setpagedevice"
           *CloseGroup: General

       So if you wanted to use "US Letter" sized paper, you would use the
       following command:

           lp -o PageSize=Letter

METHODS
   new
           my $ppd = PostScript::PPD->new;
           my $ppd = PostScript::PPD->new( $ppdfile );

       Create the object, optionally loading $ppdfile.

   load
           $ppd->load( $ppdfile );

       Load a PPD file.

   parse
           $ppd->parse( $text );

       Parses a PPD as a string.  Uses "\n" as line sepperators.

   get
           my $value = $ppd->get( $name );
           my $value = $ppd->get( $name, $subkey );

           my $value = $ppd->$name();
           my $value = $ppd->$name( $subkey );

       Returns one value from the PPD.

           my $ps = $ppd->CustomPageSize( 'True' );
           my $ps = $ppd->get( 'CustomPageSize', 'True' );

       No, this doesn't set the CustomPageSize to True; it returns the
       PostScript needed by the printer to set CustomPageSize to True.

       The value returned is a "PostScript::PPD::Subkey" object or a simple
       string for information keys.

   AUTOLOAD
       "AUTOLOAD" is used to implement accessor methods for all keys in the
       PPD.

   Groups
           my @groups = $ppd->Groups;
           my $arrayref = $ppd->Groups;

       Returns a list of available groups, in the order they are defined in
       the PPD.

   Group
           my $group = $ppd->Group( $groupname );

       Returns one UI option group named $groupname.  An option group would be
       displayed as one tab in the printer configuration widget.

       Syntatic sugar for

           my $group = $ppd->get( group => $groupname );

PostScript::PPD::Subkey
       A "PostScript::PPD::Subkey" represents a group of UI options, a single
       UI option, or the value of one UI option key.

   get
       Get a key from this subkey.  Itself returning either a
       "PostScript::PPD::Subkey" or a simple scalar.

   AUTOLOAD
           my $text = $PageSize->Letter

       Syntatic sugar for

           my $text = $PageSize->get( 'Letter' );

   as_string
           print "$subkey";
           print $subkey->get('value')||$subkey;

       A PPD subkey will stringies to it's "value".

   name
       Returns the name of this UI group, option or key.

   default
       Get the default value for this UI option.  That is, for option
       PageSize, returns the option PageSizeBDefault.

   text
       Returns the text you will want to display.

   UIs
       Get a list of all UI options in a group.

   UI
       Get a single UI option from a group.

list
       Returns a list of all values for this UI option.

sorted_list
       Returns a list of all values for this UI option, sort by their "text".

   Dump
       Handy method to dump out the object.  Because Data::Dumper will print
       the entire PPD.
