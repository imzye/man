CIDR(1)                 FreeBSD General Commands Manual                CIDR(1)

NAME
       cidr - RFC 1878 subnet helper

SYNOPSIS
       cidr [-v]

       cidr <ipaddress/prefix> [-H]

       cidr <-b|-q|-h|-d> <ipaddress> <-b|-q|-h|-d|-p> <mask|prefix> [-H]

DESCRIPTION
       cidr is a utility for determining the network address and broadcast
       address for a CIDR subnet.  It takes as input an ip address and netmask
       in binary, dotted-quad, hexadecimal, decimal or prefix formats.  It
       outputs the network address, broadcast address, and a count (and
       optionally a list) of valid host addresses for the corresponding
       subnet.

OPTIONS
       -v     print version information

       -b <ipaddress|mask>
              IP address or mask as a binary number

       -q <ipaddress|mask>
              ip address or mask as a dotted-quad

       -h <ipaddress|mask>
              ip address or mask as a hexadecimal number

       -d <ipaddress|mask>
              ip address or mask as a decimal number

       -p <prefix>
              netmask as a CIDR prefix (decimal integer 1-32)

       -H     print a list of valid host addresses

       ipaddress
              ip address in the form specified by option -b, -q, -h, or -d

       mask   netmask in the form specified by option -b, -q, -h, or -d

       prefix netmask as a CIDR prefix (decimal integer 1-32)

EXAMPLES
       cidr 192.168.14.56/27

       cidr 192.168.14.56/27 -H

       Note:  The above forms only support dotted-quad ip address and prefix
       netmask.

       cidr -q 192.168.14.56 -h ffffff00

       cidr -q 192.168.14.56 -q 255.255.255.0 -H

       cidr -h 0xfe12abcf -b 11111111111111111111111100000000

       cidr -d 2929937821 -p 32

       cidr -b 11110000101010100101010111001100 -p 24 -H

BUGS
       Hangs on calculation of 255.255.255.255/32
