blt chrom-lens(1)       FreeBSD General Commands Manual      blt chrom-lens(1)





SYNOPSIS
       blt chrom-lens < file.fasta


DESCRIPTION
       blt chrom-lens Generates TSV (tab separated values) output containing
       chromosome names and lengths as required by kallisto and other tools.
       Since the lengths are taken directly from the FASTA reference file,
       this eliminates the need to locate and trust other sources of this
       information.


EXAMPLES
       blt chrom-lens < file.fasta
       xzcat file.fasta.xz | blt chrom-lens
