DN(3)                 User Contributed Perl Documentation                DN(3)


NAME
       X500::DN - handle X.500 DNs (Distinguished Names), parse and format
       them

SYNOPSIS
         use X500::DN;

         my $dn = X500::DN->ParseRFC2253 ('cn=John Doe, o=Acme\\, Inc., c=US') or die;
         print $dn->getRFC2253String(), "\n";

         $dn = new X500::DN (new X500::RDN ('c'=>'US'), new X500::RDN ('cn'=>'John Doe'));
         my $rdn0 = $dn->getRDN (0);
         my $c = $rdn0->getAttributeValue ('c');

NOTE
       The RFC 2253 syntax is explicitely backwards in relation to the ASN.1
       SEQUENCE.

       So the RFC 2253 string "cn=John Doe, c=US" has the same meaning as the
       X.500 string "c=US, cn=John Doe".  The X500::DN objects keep the RDNs
       in X.500 order!

DESCRIPTION
       This module handles X.500 DNs (Distinguished Names).  Currently, it
       parses DN strings formatted according to RFC 2253 syntax into an
       internal format and produces RFC 2253 formatted string from it.

   Methods
       •   $object = new X500::DN (rdn, rdn, ...);

           Creates a DN object from zero or more arguments of type X500::RDN.

       •   $object = X500::DN->ParseRFC2253 ('cn=John Doe, o=Acme\\, Inc.,
           c=US');

           Creates a DN object from an RFC 2253 formatted DN string notation.

       •   $object->getRFC2253String();

           Returns the DN as a string formatted according to RFC 2253 syntax.

       •   $object->getOpenSSLString();

           Returns the DN as a string formatted suitable for "openssl req
           -subj" and "openssl ca -subj".

       •   $object->getX500String();

           Returns the DN as a string formatted according to X.500 syntax.
           NOTE: This is a hack, there is no definition for a X.500 string
           syntax!

       •   $object->hasMultivaluedRDNs();

           Returns whether the DN contains multi-valued RDNs.

       •   $object->getRDN (num);

           Returns the DN's RDN at position num as an X500::RDN object.  num
           starts with 0, which will return the first RDN in ASN.1 SEQUENCE
           order.

       •   $object->getRDNs();

           Returns the DN's RDNs, a list of objects of type X500::RDN, in
           ASN.1 SEQUENCE order.

   EXPORT
       None.

BUGS
       •   Due to Parse::RecDescent's greedyness, white space after attribute
           values gets into the parsed value.  It might be possible to work
           around this.
