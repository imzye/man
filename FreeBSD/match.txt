DESCRIPTION
       This program is designed to match up items in two different lists,
       which may have two different systems of coordinates.  The program
       allows the two sets of coordinates to be related by a linear,
       quadratic, or cubic transformation.  It is an implementation of the
       algorithm described in Valdes et al., Publications of the Astronomical
       Society of the Pacific, vol 107, page 1119 (1995); see also Droege et
       al., Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, vol 118,
       page 1666 (2006).


       The basic idea is to select the brightest nobj objects from each list,
       then to create a (very large) set of triangles using the stars in each
       list.  By finding similar triangles in the two sets, one can identify
       matching stars from the two lists.  This method is insensitive to
       translation, rotation, scaling, and inversion, but it can take a long
       time.  After finding candidate matching pairs, the program enters a
       loop in which it computes a geometric transformation, determines the
       residuals between the actual and transformed coordinates, and discards
       the the most discrepant items; the user can set parameters controlling
       the iteration of this loop using command-line arguments max_iter and
       halt_sigma.



OPTIONS
       id1=N  column in fileA containing "ID" value of items


       id2=N  column in fileB containing "ID" value of items (the values must
              be unique within each list; the program will not check, and
              strange behavior will result if duplicate IDs occur)


       outfile=abc
              place output in files with base name "abc"
                  abc.mtA    items from list A which had matches in list B
                  abc.mtB    items from list B which had matches in list A
                  abc.unA    items from list A which had no matches in list B
                  abc.unB    items from list B which had no matches in list A


       trirad=0.001
              critical value for counting triangles as a match (default value
              0.002; see below)



       nobj=30
              use the brightest 'nobj' values in each list during the matching
              process (default value 20)


       matchrad=4
              after applying transformation to listA, so that both lists are
              in coordinate system of listB, items from the two lists must be
              within this distance to count as 'matched' (default value 5)


       scale=2.0
              if present, only triangles with the given scale factor are
              counted as matches (in this example, only triangles in coord
              system A which are about 2.0 times larger than triangles in
              coord system B are counted as matches)


       min_scale=1.5
              if present, only triangles with ratios greater than the given
              scale factor are counted as matches


       max_scale=2.5
              if present, only triangles with ratios less than the given scale
              factor are counted as matches


       max_iter=3
              during the solution process, there is a loop in which the code
              matches stars in the two lists, finds the residuals for each
              pair, and discards pairs with big residuals.  This argument sets
              a limit on the number of times this loop can be entered.
              Default value is given by AT_MATCH_MAXITER parameter in
              atpmatch.h, currently 3.


       halt_sigma=1.0e-12
              during the solution process, if the typical residual between
              pairs of stars in the two lists drops to this level, stop
              iterating and declare success.  The units are the square of the
              units in the second list of stars; often, radians squared.
              Default value is given by AT_MATCH_HALTSIGMA parameter in
              atpmatch.h, currently 1.0e-12.


       transonly
              if present, stop after having derived a transformation which
              best takes the 'nobj' objects from list A into objects in list
              B.  Don't go on to find the matching objects explicitly.


       recalc if present, after having derived a transformation with the
              brightest 'nobj' objects, and having applied that transformation
              to ALL the objects in list A, derive a transformation again,
              this time using ALL the objects in list A and list B


       linear use a linear transformation (the default)


       quadratic
              use a quadratic transformation


       cubic  use a cubic transformation

       medtf  calculate the MEDTF statistics (see below); assumes that a
              simple translation connects the two lists


       medsigclip=N
              discard matched pairs more than N stdev from the median offset
              before calculating MEDTF statistics


       identity
              as an initial guess, use a linear TRANS in which there is no
              rotation, change in scale, or translation (unless xsh= and ysh=
              are specified)


       xsh=   in initial guess, use linear TRANS with the given translation in
              the 'x' direction


       ysh=   in initial guess, use linear TRANS with the given translation in
              the 'x' direction


       intrans=file
              as an initial guess, use the TRANS which is given in the ASCII
              text file 'file' (see below for the format)


       --version
              print the current version number and exit


       --help print list of command-line options


       help   print list of command-line options




       The argument "trirad" may need some extra explanation.  For a full
       desciption, see the paper by Valdes et al.  In short, stars are grouped
       into triangles, the sides of which are labelled "a", "b" and "c" in
       order of decreasing size.  The normalized ratios b/a and c/a
       are formed for each triangle.  In order for a triangle, t1, from one
       list to be considered identical to a triangle, t2, in the other list,
       it must satisfy the equation

            sqrt[ (t1.ba - t2.ba)^2 + (t1.ca - t2.ca)^2 ] <= trirad

       So the value of "trirad" has units of neither list; it exists in a two-
       dimensional "triangle-space" formed by the coordinates b/a and c/a
       (each of which ranges from 0.0 to 1.0).


       One way the user can control the matching of triangles is to specify a
       "scale factor".  Only triangles with a ratio of size falling with a
       particular window will be counted as matches.  The user can control the
       "scale factor window" in two ways:

            using the scale= option alone; for example, scale=1.5 The window
            is centered on the given factor, and extends a percentage
            (AT_MATCH_PERCENT) above it and below it.

            using both min_scale and max_scale together; for example,
            min_scale=1.3 max_scale=1.7 The window extends from the min_scale
            to max_scale, including both boundaries.


       If the two lists are known to have the same scale and rotation, the
       user may use the identity keyword to force an initial guess at the
       TRANS: a linear model with
            a=0.0   b=1.0   c=0.0
            d=0.0   e=0.0   f=1.0
       The program will use this initial TRANS structure to match up the items
       in the two lists, rather than trying to figure out the transformation
       itself.  After looking for matched items with this fixed model, the
       program will use the matched pairs it finds to define an improved
       TRANS.


       In a similar vein, if the user knows that the scale and rotation of the
       two sets of objects are identical, but there is a fixed and known
       translation of XX units in the x-direction and YY units in the y-
       direction, he can use the identity keyword with additional arguments
            xsh=XX  ysh=YY
       which will create an initial TRANS with
            a=XX    b=1.0   c=0.0
            d=YY    e=0.0   f=1.0


       Finally, for ultimate control, the user may specify the exact values of
       the coefficients for the initial TRANS via the intrans=filename option.
       The program will look for an ASCII text file with the given filename,
       which must have the following format:
         a)  blank lines are skipped
         b)  lines starting with the '#' character are skipped
         c)  the first non-skipped line must describe the order of the model,
                either by one of the following keywords

                    linear quadratic cubic

                or by a line like norder=NN, in which
                NN has value 1 for linear, 2 for quadratic, or 3 for cubic.
         d) all following non-blank lines must give values for the coefficients
                of the specified TRANS model, in the general form

                    a=33.34
                    b=1.3e-4
                    c 99.01
                    d -5.323e1
               Note that the equals sign between the coefficient and the value
                 is optional


       In any case, if the user specifies the initial TRANS, either via the
       identity or intrans method, that initial model is used to convert the
       coordinates of objects in list A into the system of list B.  The
       program then looks for matches within the matchrad units.  It then uses
       only the matched pairs to generate an improved TRANS model.


       On the other hand, if the user does NOT provide an initial TRANS model,
       the program searches for one itself.  After its first guess, the code
       matches up candidate pairs of stars from the two lists.  It then enters
       a loop in which it calculates a plate solution, applies the solution to
       the stars in list A, then compares the predicted positions from list A
       to the actual positions of stars in list B.  Based on those residuals,
       the code marks some of the pairs as "bad", discards them, and goes back
       to the top of the loop.  The max_iter and halt_sigma arguments can be
       used to control the number of times the code enters this loop and
       discards possible matches.  Note that, if one uses the project_coords
       routine to turn (RA, Dec) positions from a catalog into an input list,
       the units will of this list will be radians; hence, the residuals from
       a solution against this list will be in radians squared.  A typical
       residual of 1 arcsec corresponds to halt_sigma of 2.4e-11 radians
       squared.
