NAME
       archey4 - A simple system information tool written in Python


SYNOPSIS
       archey [options]
       archey4 [options]


DESCRIPTION
       Archey4 is a maintained fork of the original Archey Linux system tool.
       The original Archey program had been written by Melik Manukyan in 2009,
       and quickly abandoned in 2011.
       At first, it only supported Arch Linux distribution, further support
       had been added afterwards.
       Many forks popped in the wild due to inactivity, but this one attends
       since 2017 to succeed where the others failed:
       Remain maintained, community-driven and highly-compatible with
       yesterday's and today's systems.
