TERASIC_MTL(4)         FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual         TERASIC_MTL(4)

NAME
     terasic_mtl – driver for the Terasic/Cambridge Multi-Touch LCD device

SYNOPSIS
     device terasic_mtl

     In /boot/device.hints:
     hint.terasic_mtl.0.at="nexus0"
     hint.terasic_mtl.0.reg_maddr=0x70400000
     hint.terasic_mtl.0.reg_msize=0x1000
     hint.terasic_mtl.0.pixel_maddr=0x70000000
     hint.terasic_mtl.0.pixel_msize=0x177000
     hint.terasic_mtl.0.text_maddr=0x70177000
     hint.terasic_mtl.0.text_msize=0x2000

DESCRIPTION
     The terasic_mtl device driver provides support for the Terasic Multi-
     Touch LCD combined as controlled by a University of Cambridge's IP Core.
     Three device nodes are instantiated, representing various services
     supported by the device:

     terasic_regX    Memory-mapped register interface, including touch screen
                     input.

     terasic_pixelX  Memory-mapped pixel-oriented frame buffer.

     terasic_textX   Memory-mapped text-oriented frame buffer.

     terasic_mtl devices are also attached to the syscons(4) framework, which
     implements a VT-compatible terminal connected to the tty(4) framework.
     ttyvX device nodes may be added to ttys(5) in order to launch login(1)
     sessions at boot.

     Register, text, and pixel devices may be accessed using read(2) and
     write(2) system calls, and also memory mapped using mmap(2).

SEE ALSO
     login(1), ioctl(2), mmap(2), poll(2), read(2), write(2), syscons(4),
     tty(4), ttys(5)

HISTORY
     The terasic_mtl device driver first appeared in FreeBSD 10.0.

AUTHORS
     The terasic_mtl device driver and this manual page were developed by SRI
     International and the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory under
     DARPA/AFRL contract (FA8750-10-C-0237) (“CTSRD”), as part of the DARPA
     CRASH research programme.  This device driver was written by Robert N. M.
     Watson.

BUGS
     The syscons(4) attachment does not support the hardware cursor feature.

     A more structured interface to control registers using the ioctl(2)
     system call, would sometimes be preferable to memory mapping.  For touch
     screen input, it would be highly desirable to offer a streaming interface
     whose events can be managed using poll(2) and related system calls, with
     the kernel performing polling rather than the userspace application.

     terasic_mtl supports only a nexus bus attachment, which is appropriate
     for system-on-chip busses such as Altera's Avalon bus.  If the IP core is
     configured off of another bus type, then additional bus attachments will
     be required.
