NAME
       KinoSearch1 - search engine library

VERSION
       1.01

STABLE FORK
       KinoSearch1 is a fork of KinoSearch version 0.165 intended to provide
       stability and backwards compatibility.  For the latest features, see
       the main branch.

SYNOPSIS
       First, write an application to build an inverted index, or "invindex",
       from your document collection.

           use KinoSearch1::InvIndexer;
           use KinoSearch1::Analysis::PolyAnalyzer;

           my $analyzer
               = KinoSearch1::Analysis::PolyAnalyzer->new( language => 'en' );

           my $invindexer = KinoSearch1::InvIndexer->new(
               invindex => '/path/to/invindex',
               create   => 1,
               analyzer => $analyzer,
           );

           $invindexer->spec_field(
               name  => 'title',
               boost => 3,
           );
           $invindexer->spec_field( name => 'bodytext' );

           while ( my ( $title, $bodytext ) = each %source_documents ) {
               my $doc = $invindexer->new_doc;

               $doc->set_value( title    => $title );
               $doc->set_value( bodytext => $bodytext );

               $invindexer->add_doc($doc);
           }

           $invindexer->finish;

       Then, write a second application to search the invindex:

           use KinoSearch1::Searcher;
           use KinoSearch1::Analysis::PolyAnalyzer;

           my $analyzer
               = KinoSearch1::Analysis::PolyAnalyzer->new( language => 'en' );

           my $searcher = KinoSearch1::Searcher->new(
               invindex => '/path/to/invindex',
               analyzer => $analyzer,
           );

           my $hits = $searcher->search( query => "foo bar" );
           while ( my $hit = $hits->fetch_hit_hashref ) {
               print "$hit->{title}\n";
           }

DESCRIPTION
       KinoSearch1 is a loose port of the Java search engine library Apache
       Lucene, written in Perl and C. The archetypal application is website
       search, but it can be put to many different uses.

   Features
       •   Extremely fast and scalable - can handle millions of documents

       •   Incremental indexing (addition/deletion of documents to/from an
           existing index).

       •   Full support for 12 Indo-European languages.

       •   Support for boolean operators AND, OR, and AND NOT; parenthetical
           groupings, and prepended +plus and -minus

       •   Algorithmic selection of relevant excerpts and highlighting of
           search terms within excerpts

       •   Highly customizable query and indexing APIs

       •   Phrase matching

       •   Stemming

       •   Stoplists

   Getting Started
       KinoSearch1 has many, many classes, but you only need to get aquainted
       with three to start with:

       •   KinoSearch1::InvIndexer

       •   KinoSearch1::Searcher

       •   KinoSearch1::Analysis::PolyAnalyzer

       Probably the quickest way to get something up and running is to cut and
       paste the sample applications out of KinoSearch1::Docs::Tutorial and
       adapt them for your purposes.

History
       Search::Kinosearch 0.02x, no longer supported, is this suite's
       forerunner.  Plucene is a pure-Perl port of Lucene 1.3. KinoSearch is a
       from-scratch project which attempts to draws on the lessons of both.
       The API is not compatible with either.

       KinoSearch is named for Kino, the main character in John Steinbeck's
       novella, "The Pearl".

SUPPORT
       Please direct support questions to the KinoSearch mailing list:

BUGS
       UTF-8 scalars are not indexed properly.  This is fixed in KinoSearch
       0.3x, but cannot be fixed in KinoSearch1 without breaking index
       compatibility with KinoSearch 0.165 from which KinoSearch1 was forked.

       Not thread-safe.

       Indexing crashes reliably on Solaris 2.9 or other systems which are
       fussy about pointer alignment.
