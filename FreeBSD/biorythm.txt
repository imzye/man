SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
       The biorythm program calculates a simple biorythm plot based on the
       given date of birth. The plot starts at the given first day of plot,
       and includes the number of days indicated on the command line.

       Dates must be entered according to ISO date format, that is: YYYY-MM-
       DD, four digit year, two digit month, and two digit day of month.

       The default plot includes emotional, intellectual and physical curves.
       This may be overridden by command line options.

       The author has no idea how to interpret the plot, so please don't ask
       him about it.
