NAME
       Number::Phone::JP - Validate Japanese phone numbers

SYNOPSIS
        use Number::Phone::JP;

        my $tel = Number::Phone::JP->new('012', '34567890');
        print "This is valid!!\n" if $tel->is_valid_number;

        $tel->set_number('098 7654 3210');
        print "This is valid!!\n" if $tel->is_valid_number;

        $tel->import(qw(mobile PHS));
        $tel->set_number('090-0123-4567');
        print "This is valid!!\n" if $tel->is_valid_number;

DESCRIPTION
       Number::Phone::JP is a simple module to validate Japanese phone number
       formats. The Japanese phone numbers are regulated by Ministry of
       Internal Affairs and Communications of Japan.  You can validate what a
       target number is valid from this regulation point of view.

       There are many categories for type of telephones in Japan. This module
       is able to be used narrowed down to the type of phones.

       This module only validates what a phone number agrees on the
       regulation. Therefore, it does NOT validate what a phone number
       actually exists.

       This validation needs only an area (or category) prefix and behind it.
       The separator of number behind the prefix is ignored.

METHODS
   new
       This method constructs the Number::Phone::JP instance. you can put some
       argument of a phone number to it.  It needs a two stuff for validation,
       area prefix (or carrier's prefix) and following (means local-area
       prefix, subscriber's number, and something).

       If you put only one argument, this module will separate it by the first
       non-number character. And it will be ignored any non-number characters.

   import
       It exists to select what categories is used for validation. You should
       pass some specified categories to this method.

       Categories list is as follows:

        Class1   ... Class1 undertaking associations
        Class2   ... Class2 undertaking associations
        Freedial ... Freedials
        Home     ... Household phones
        IPPhone  ... IP phones
        Mobile   ... Mobile phones
        Pager    ... Pager (called "pocketbell")
        PHS      ... Personal Handy-phone Systems
        Q2       ... Dial Q2 services
        United   ... United phone number
        FMC      ... Fixed Mobile Convergence
                     (was started in 2007 in Japan)
        UPT      ... Universal Personal Telecommunication
                     (was merged to FMC category in 2007 in Japan.
                      this class works same as FMC.
                      it's left for backward compatibility.)

       The category's names are ignored case. Actually, the import method
       calls others "Number::Phone::JP::Table::"Category module and import
       this. The default importing table, "Number::Phone::JP::Table" module is
       including all the categories table.

       For importing, you can import by calling this method, and you can
       import by calling this module with some arguments.

        Example:
         # by calling import method
         use Number::Phone::JP; # import all the categories (default)
         my $tel = Number::Phone::JP->new->import(qw(mobile PHS));

         # by calling this module
         use Number::Phone::JP qw(Mobile Phs);
         my $tel = Number::Phone::JP->new; # same as above

   set_number
       Set/change the target phone number. The syntax of arguments for this
       method is same as new() method (see above).

   is_valid_number
       This method validates what the already set number is valid on your
       specified categories. It returns true if the number is valid, and
       returns false if the number is invalid.

Number::Phone COMPATIBLE METHODS
   is_valid
       Simply you can call is_valid() method instead of "is_valid_number".

   is_mobile
       It checks that is the prefix of the number which you set is used for
       mobile numbers. It just checks only prefix.

   is_pager
       It checks that is the prefix of the number which you set is used for
       pager (a.k.a pocketbell) numbers. It just checks only prefix.

   is_ipphone
       It checks that is the prefix of the number which you set is used for IP
       phone numbers. It just checks only prefix.

   is_tollfree
       It checks that is the prefix of the number which you set is used for IP
       tollfree (a.k.a. freedial) numbers. It just checks only prefix.

   is_specialrate
       It checks that is the prefix of the number which you set is used for
       specialrate (a.k.a. dial Q2) numbers. It just checks only prefix.
