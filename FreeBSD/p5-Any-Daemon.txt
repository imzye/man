NAME
       Any::Daemon - basic needs for a daemon

INHERITANCE
        Any::Daemon is extended by
          Any::Daemon::HTTP

SYNOPSIS
         use Any::Daemon;
         use Log::Report;

         # Prepare a daemon for the Operating System
         my $daemon = Any::Daemon->new(@os_opts);

         # Start logging to syslog (see Log::Report::Dispatcher)
         dispatcher SYSLOG => 'syslog';

         # Run managing daemon
         $daemon->run(@run_opts);

DESCRIPTION
       This module delivers the basic needs for any daemon on UNIX systems.
       There are other standard daemon implementations available on CPAN, with
       as main common difference that this module is not dedicated to a
       specific task. By using Log::Report, you can easily redirect error
       reports to any logging mechanism you like.

       The code for this module is in use for many different daemons, some
       with heavy load (a few dozen requests per second)  Have a look in the
       examples directory!  Also, you may like Any::Daemon::HTTP

METHODS
   Constructors
       Any::Daemon->new(%options)
           With new() you provide the operating system integration %options,
           where run() gets the activity related parameters: the real action.

           Be warned that the user, group, and workdir will not immediately be
           effected: delayed until run().

            -Option  --Default
             group     undef
             pid_file  undef
             user      undef
             workdir   current working directory

           group => GID|GROUPNAME
             Change to this group (when started as root)

           pid_file => FILENAME
           user => UID|USERNAME
             Change to this user (when started as root)  If you want to run
             your daemon as root, then explicitly specify that with this
             option, to avoid a warning.

           workdir => DIRECTORY
             Change DIRECTORY so temporary files and such are not written in
             the random directory where the daemon got started.

             If the directory does not exist yet, it will be created with mode
             0700 when the daemon object is initialized. We only move to that
             directory when the daemon is run. The working directory does not
             get cleaned when the daemon stops.

   Accessors
       $obj->pidFilename()
       $obj->workdir()
           [0.90] assigned working directory of the daemon in the file-system.

   Action
       $obj->run(%options)
           The "run" method gets the activity related parameters.

           You specify either "run_task", for the function to be called by
           this deamon itself, or "child_task" when you wish to manage child
           tasks which run the action.

           [0.96] When you pass a method name, it will be called on this
           object.  This is very clean when you have extended this daemon
           class.

            -Option     --Default
             background   <true>
             child_died   'childDied'
             child_task   undef
             kill_childs  'killChilds'
             max_childs   10
             reconfigure  'reconfigDaemon'
             run_task     undef

           background => BOOLEAN
             Run the managing daemon in the background. During testing, it is
             prefered to run the daemon in the foreground, to be able to stop
             the daemon with Crtl-C and to see errors directly on the screen
             in stead of only in some syslog file.

           child_died => CODE|METHOD
             The "child_died" routine handles dieing kids and the restart of
             new ones.  It gets two parameters: the maximum number of childs
             plus the task to perform per kid.

           child_task => CODE|METHOD
             The CODE will be run for each child which is started, also when
             they are started later on. If the task is not specified, only a
             warning is produced. This may be useful when you start
             implementing the daemon: you do not need to care about the task
             to perform yet.

             The returned value of thise CODE is used as exit code of the
             child process, where zero means 'ok'.

           kill_childs => CODE|METHOD
             The CODE terminates all running children, maybe to start new
             ones, maybe to terminate the whole daemon.

           max_childs => INTEGER
             The maximum (is usual) number of childs to run.

           reconfigure => CODE|METHOD
             The CODE is run when a SIGHUP is received; signal 1 is used by
             most daemons as trigger for reconfiguration.

           run_task => CODE|METHOD
             [0.96] The CODE which will be run by this process.  This implies:
             no managed children.
