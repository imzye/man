NAME
       Class::DBI::Loader::Relationship - Easier relationship specification in
       CDBI::Loader

SYNOPSIS
         use Class::DBI::Loader::Relationship;

         my $loader = Class::DBI::Loader->new( dsn => "mysql:beerdb",
                                               namespace => "BeerDB");

       Now instead of saying

           BeerDB::Brewery->has_many(beers => "BeerDB::Beer");
           BeerDB::Beer->has_a(brewery => "BeerDB::Brewery");

           BeerDB::Handpump->has_a(beer => "BeerDB::Beer");
           BeerDB::Handpump->has_a(pub => "BeerDB::Pub");
           BeerDB::Pub->has_many(beers => [ BeerDB::Handpump => 'beer' ]);
           BeerDB::Beer->has_many(pubs => [ BeerDB::Handpump => 'pub' ]);

       Just say

           $loader->relationship( "a brewery produces beers" );
           $loader->relationship( "a pub has beers on handpumps" );

       And something like ( upgraded in v1.3 )

           MyApp::Page->has_a( author => 'MyApp::User' );
           MyApp::Page->has_many( revisions => 'MyApp::PageRevision' );

       Just say

           $loader->relationship( "a page has an user as author" );
           $loader->relationship( "a page has many page_revisions as revisions" );

DESCRIPTION
       This module acts as a mix-in, adding the "relationship" method to
       "Class::DBI::Loader". Since "Class::DBI::Loader" knows how to map
       between table names and class names, there ought to be no need to
       replicate the names.

       In addition, it is common (but not universal) to want reverse
       relationships defined for has-many relationships, and for has-a
       relationships to be defined for the linkages surrounding a many-to-many
       table.

       The aim of "CDBIL::Relationship" is to simplify the declaration of
       common database relationships by providing both of these features.

       The "relationship" takes a string. It recognises table names (singular
       or plural, for convenience) and extracts them from the "sentence".
