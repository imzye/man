XML::Handler::AxPoint(3)                   User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       XML::Handler::AxPoint - AxPoint XML to PDF Slideshow generator

SYNOPSIS
       Using SAX::Machines:

         use XML::SAX::Machines qw(Pipeline);
         use XML::Handler::AxPoint;

         Pipeline( XML::Handler::AxPoint->new() )->parse_uri("presentation.axp");

       Or using directly:

         use XML::SAX;
         use XML::Handler::AxPoint;

         my $parser = XML::SAX::ParserFactory->parser(
             Handler => XML::Handler::AxPoint->new(
                 Output => "presentation.pdf"
                 )
             );

         $parser->parse_uri("presentation.axp");

DESCRIPTION
       This module is a port and enhancement of the AxKit presentation tool,
       AxPoint. It takes an XML description of a slideshow, and generates a
       PDF. The resulting presentations are very nice to look at, possibly
       rivalling PowerPoint, and almost certainly better than most other
       freeware presentation tools on Unix/Linux.

       The presentations support slide transitions, PDF bookmarks, bullet
       points, source code (fixed font) sections, images, SVG vector graphics,
       tables, colours, bold and italics, hyperlinks, and transition effects
       for all the bullet points, source, and image sections.

SYNTAX
   <slideshow>
       This is the outer element, and must always be present.

       Optional attributes:

       •   default-transition - contains the transition to be used for each
           slide in the slideshow. See the details of transitions below.

       •   coordinates - either "svg" or "old". By default the AxPoint
           graphics are drawn using SVG-style coordinates, however prior to
           cvs id 1.45 the coordinates were inverted due to lazy coding. If
           you have presentations prior to this version, or you want
           coordinates to start at the top of the screen, specify
           coordinates="old".

   <title>
         <slideshow>
           <title>My First Presentation</title>

       The title of the slideshow, used on the first (title) slide.

   <metadata>
         <metadata>
            <speaker>Matt Sergeant</speaker>
            <email>matt@axkit.com</email>
            <organisation>AxKit.com Ltd</organisation>
            <link>http://axkit.com/</link>
            <logo scale="0.4">ax_logo.png</logo>
            <background scale="1.1page">redbg.png</background>
            <bullet level="1">n</bullet>
            <bullet level="2">l</bullet>
            <bullet level="3">u</bullet>
            <bullet level="4">F</bullet>
            <numbers level="3">item#$1 -</numbers>
            <numbers level="4">($a)</numbers>
         </metadata>

       Metadata for the slideshow. Speaker and Organisation are used on the
       first (title) slide, and the email and link are turned into hyperlinks.

       The background and logo are used on every slide.

       The bullet tags define the bullet characters (taken from the
       ZapfDingbats font) to be used for various point levels.

       Using the numbers tag, you can customize list numbering. The text
       contained is used as-is, with special sequences replaced by the current
       point number: $1 = plain arabic digits, $a/$A = lower-/uppercase
       letters, $i/$I = lower/uppercase roman numbers and $$ = a plain dollar
       sign.

       You are allowed to put <metadata> sections between slides to override
       settings for all following slides.

   <slideset>
         <slideset>
           <title>A subset of the show</title>
           <subtitle>And a subtitle for it</subtitle>

       A slideset groups slides into relevant subsets, with a title and a new
       level in the bookmarks for the PDF.

       The title and subtitle tags can have "href" attributes which turn those
       texts into links.

       Slidesets may be nested, in which case you can create a
       chapter-section-subsection-... structure. Mixing slides and slidesets
       on the same level will likewise produce the expected results.

   <slide>
         <slide transition="dissolve">
           <title>Introduction</title>
           <list>
             <point>Perl's XML Capabilities</point>
           </list>
           <source-code>use XML::SAX;</source-code>
         </slide>

       The slide tag defines a single slide. Each top level tag in the slide
       can have a "transition" attribute, which either defines a transition
       for the entire slide, or for the individual top level items.

       The valid settings for transition are:

       replace
           The default. Just replace the old page. Use this on top level page
           items to make them appear one by one.

       split
           Two lines sweeping across the screen reveal the page

       blinds
           Multiple lines sweep across the screen to reveal the page

       box A box reveals the page

       wipe
           A single line sweaping across the screen reveals the page

       dissolve
           The old page dissolves to reveal the new page

       glitter
           The dissolve effect moves from one screen edge to another

       For example, to have each point on a slide reveal themselves one by
       one:

         <slide>
           <title>Transitioning Bullet Points</title>
           <list>
             <point transition="replace">Point 1</point>
             <point transition="replace">Point 2</point>
             <point transition="replace">Final Point</point>
           </list>
         </slide>

   <list>/<point>
       The point specifies a bullet point to place on your slide.

       The point may have a "href" attribute, a "transition" attribute, and a
       "level" attribute. The "level" attribute is still supported and
       defaults to 1.  However, it is recommended to use <list> tags to
       indicate nesting.  The level can go down as far as you please, though
       you might need to define bullets with <bullet> in <metadata> for levels
       greater than 4.

       The list optionally takes a flag, ordered="ordered", to indicate that
       the points below should be numbered. <numbers> in <metadata> can be
       used to customize numbering style.

   <plain>
       The <plain> tag denotes plain text to be put on the page without any
       bullet point. It takes an optional attribute "align" with values
       "left", "center", or "right".

   <source-code> or <source_code>
       The source-code tag identifies a piece of verbatim text in a fixed font
       - originally designed for source code.

   <image>
       The image tag works in one of two ways. For backwards compatibility it
       allows you to specify the URI of the image in the text content of the
       tag:

         <image>foo.png</image>

       Or for compatibility with SVG, you can use xlink:

         <image xlink:href="foo.png"
                xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>

       By default, the image is placed centered in the current column (which
       is the middle of the slide if you are not using tables) and at the
       current text position. However you can override this using x and y
       attributes for absolute positioning. You may also specify a scale
       attribute to scale the image.

       Scaling specifiers can look like this:

       •   0.5 (single float) denotes a scaling multiplier, 0.5 means "half
           size".
            The image's DPI value is correctly used.

       •   1.5em (float + unit) denotes a fixed width/height. Supported units
           are: 'em', 'ex', 'pt', 'px', 'line', 'page'. ("M" height/width, "x"
           height/width, points, pixels, line height/width, page height/width)

       •   0.5*1.0 (two floats) denotes non-uniform scaling, in this case
           "half width, but full height"

       •   1.5em*0.1line (likewise with units)

       The supported image formats are those supported by the underlying
       pdflib library: gif, jpg, png and tiff.

   <colour> or <color>
       The colour tag specifies a colour for the text to be output. To define
       the colour, either use the "name" attribute, using one of the 16 HTML
       named colours, or use the "rgb" attribute and use a hex triplet like
       you can in HTML.

   <i>, <b> and <u>
       Use these tags for italics, bold and underline within text.

   <span style="...">
       Using this tag, you can specify many text attributes in CSS syntax.

   <table>
         <table>
           <row>
             <col width="40%">
             ...
             </col>
             <col width="60%">
             ...
             </col>
           </row>
         </table>

       AxPoint has some rudimentary table support, as you can see above. This
       is fairly experimental, and does not do any reflowing like HTML - it
       only supports fixed column widths and only as percentages. Using a
       table allows you to layout a slide in two columns, and also have multi-
       row descriptions of source code with bullet points.

   <box>
         <box x="450" y="250" width="150" height="200">
           <plain>Some content, as if this were a full page</plain>
         </box>

       The box tag allows you to position arbitrary content anywhere on the
       page.  Coordinates are specified in PDF-points, i.e., (0,0) is at the
       bottom left, and (612,450) is at the top right. Note that you may only
       specify this tag at the top level of a slide, and it is recommended to
       use it before or after all regular content of that page, but after the
       title. A slide may contain any number of box tags, however, and they
       need not be at the same place in the source. Note also that the height
       tag is effectively ignored - there is no clipping.

   <value>
         <value type="current-slide"/>
         <value type="today" format="%d.%m.%Y"/>

       Inserts a special variable. The type attribute selects which one:
       slideshow-title, slide-title, logo, background, today, current-slide,
       total-slides, current-slideset, speaker, organisation, email, link.

       Notes: The "logo" and "background" types insert the image as specified
       by the corresponding
        tag in <metadata>, using the same size, at the current text position.
       The 'today' type uses an additional 'format' attribute containing a
       sprintf() style format string (optional). The total-slides tag is
       actually cheating - it reads the value from the same named tag in
       <metadata>. This is useful if you have a preprocessing step to insert
       the correct value. With all tags, you may encounter problems if you use
       them outside of <title>, <point> or <plain>.

SVG Support
       AxPoint has some SVG support so you can do vector graphics on your
       slides.  Note that the coordinate system is different from the regular
       coordinate system, (0,0) is at the left top with positive y values
       going down, which makes it easier to import graphics from external
       sources.

       All SVG items allow the "transition" attribute as defined above.

   <rect>
         <rect x="100" y="100" width="300" height="200"
           style="stroke: blue; stroke-width=5; fill: red"/>

       As you can see, AxPoint's SVG support uses CSS to define the style. The
       above draws a rectangle with a thick blue line around it, and filled in
       red.

   <circle>
         <circle cx="50" cy="100" r="50" style="stroke: black"/>

   <ellipse>
         <ellipse cx="100" cy="50" rx="30" ry="60" style="fill: aqua;"/>

   <line>
         <line x1="50" y1="50" x2="200" y2="200" style="stroke: black;"/>

   <text>
         <text x="200" y="200"
           style="stroke: black; fill: none; font: italic 24pt serif"
         >Some Floating Text</text>

       This tag allows you to float text anywhere on the screen.
