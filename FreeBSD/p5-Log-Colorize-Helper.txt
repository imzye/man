SYNOPSIS
           use Log::Colorize::Helper;
           use Getopt::Std;

           #gets the options
           my %opts=();
           getopts('efhtn:g:ivlFGJ', \%opts);

           #init it
           my $clog=Log::Colorize::Helper->new;

           #set tail/head stuff if needed
           if ( ! defined( $opts{n} ) ){
               $opts{n}=10;
           }

               $opts{h}=$opts{n};
           }

           $clog->colorize(
               {
                       echo=>$opts{e},
                       log=>$ARGV[0],

       This module uses Error::Helper for error reporting.

METHODS
   new
       Creates a new object. This method will never error.

           my $clog=Log::Colorize::Helper->new;

   colorize
       args hash

       bzip2

       The log is compressed using bzip2.

       echo

       Print the command used.

       follow

       A Perl boolean for if it should follow while tailing.

       Default is false.

       If set to true and tail is not specified it is set to 10.

       head

       How many lines to print at the top of the file.

       The default is 0, false. This means head will not be used.

       Can't be combined with tail.

       grep

       An optional string to grep for.

       grep-first

       A Perl boolean to run grep infront of the head/tail instead of after.

       The default is false.

       grep-insensitive

       This is a Perl boolean value for if grep should be case insensitive.

       The default is false.

       grep-invert

       This is a Perl boolean value for if grep should be inverted or not.

       The default is false.

       gzip

       The log is compressed using gzip.

       less

       A Perl boolean value for if it should pass it to 'less -R'

       log

       The log file to colorize.

       tail

       How many lines to print at the bottom of the file.

       The default is 0, false. This means tail will not be used.

       Can't be combined with head.

           #gets the options
           my %opts=();
           getopts('efhtn:g:ivlFGJ', \%opts);

           #init it
           my $clog=Log::Colorize::Helper->new;

           #set tail/head stuff if needed
           if ( ! defined( $opts{n} ) ){
               $opts{n}=10;
           }
           if ( $opts{t} ){
               $opts{t}=$opts{n};
           }
           if ( $opts{h} ){
               $opts{h}=$opts{n};
           }

           $clog->colorize(
               {
                       echo=>$opts{e},

                       'grep-insensitive'=>$opts{i},
                       'grep-invert'=>$opts{v},
                       'grep-first'=>$opts{F},
                       bzip2=>$opts{J},
