LIBRARY
     Math Library (libm, -lm)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <math.h>

DESCRIPTION
     The math library includes the following components:
           <math.h>       basic routines and real-valued functions
           <complex.h>    complex number support
           <tgmath.h>     polymorphic (type-generic) versions of functions
           <fenv.h>       routines to control rounding and exceptions
     The rest of this manual page describes the functions provided by
     <math.h>.  Please consult complex(3), tgmath(3), and fenv(3) for
     information on the other components.

LIST OF FUNCTIONS
     Each of the following double functions has a float counterpart with an
     ‘f’ appended to the name and a long double counterpart with an ‘l’
     appended.  As an example, the float and long double counterparts of
     double acos(double x) are float acosf(float x) and long double acosl(long
     double x), respectively.  The classification macros and silent order
     predicates are type generic and should not be suffixed with ‘f’ or ‘l’.

     The routines in this section might not produce a result that is correctly
     rounded, so reproducible results cannot be guaranteed across platforms.
     For most of these functions, however, incorrect rounding occurs rarely,
     and then only in very-close-to-halfway cases.

HISTORY
     A math library with many of the present functions appeared in Version 7
     AT&T UNIX.  The library was substantially rewritten for 4.3BSD to provide
     better accuracy and speed on machines supporting either VAX or IEEE 754
     floating-point.  Most of this library was replaced with FDLIBM, developed
     at Sun Microsystems, in FreeBSD 1.1.5.  Additional routines, including
     ones for float and long double values, were written for or imported into
     subsequent versions of FreeBSD.

BUGS
     Many of the routines to compute transcendental functions produce
     inaccurate results in other than the default rounding mode.

     On the i386 platform, trigonometric argument reduction is not performed
     accurately for huge arguments, resulting in large errors for such
     arguments to cos(), sin(), and tan().
