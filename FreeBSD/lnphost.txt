lnpdump(1)               Lego Infrared Packet Monitor               lnpdump(1)

NAME
       lnpdump - Packet monitor for Lego infrared communication


SYNOPSIS
       lnpdump [ options ]


DESCRIPTION
       lnpdump is a packet monitor that decodes transmissions from Lego bricks
       that are equipped with an infrared transceiver. A lego tower must be
       connected to the PC for this program to work.


OPTIONS
       Below is a summary of the lnpdump options:

       -a, --all
              Dump data of packets even if they are broken or cannot be
              interpreted.

       -d DEVICE, --device=DEVICE
              Set the device the Lego tower is connected to. If this option is
              not present, the device name is taken from the RCXTTY
              environment variable or the built-in default value in the given
              order.

       -f, --fast
              Set the transmission speed to 4800 baud instead of 2400 baud.

       -h, --help
              Show this summary.

       -m N, --mask N
              Set the host:port bit mask value used to decode LNP addressing
              layer messages.  The default value is 0xf0 so that address 0x85
              is decoded as 0x08:0x05 (host 8, port 5).

       -p, --noparity
              Turn on legOS compatibility mode. BrickOS/legOS Versions before
              0.2.5.2 used a slightly different serial protocol (no parity bit
              instead of odd parity).

       -r, --raw (implies --all)
              Dump all received data, including keepalive bytes and broken
              packets. However, bytes that form a valid package are still
              displayd as a block.


NOTES
       This program is based on the lnphost library and should work on any
       posix compilant operating system. USB support is currently only
       available under Linux.
