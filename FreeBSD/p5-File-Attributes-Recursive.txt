File::Attributes::Recursive(3)             User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       File::Attributes::Recursive - Inherit file attributes from parent
       directories.

VERSION
       Version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
       Works like "File::Attributes", but will recurse up the directory tree
       until a matching attribute is found.

EXPORT
       None, by default.  Specify the functions you'd like to use as arguments
       to the module.  ":all" means export everything.

FUNCTIONS
   get_attribute_recursively($file, [$top], $attribute)
       Returns the value of attribute $attribute.  If $top is specified, then
       the search will terminate when the path no longer contains $top.  (i.e.
       if $file is "/foo/bar/baz/quux" and $top is

   get_attributes_recursively($file, [$top])
       Returns a hash of key value pairs for all attributes that apply to
       $file.  Only the closest attributes are returned.  Given:

             /a            (a = yes, foo = bar)
             /a/b          (b = yes, foo = baz)
             /a/b/c        (c = yes)

       "get_attributes_recursively('/a/b/c', '/a')" will return:

            (a => yes, b => yes, c => yes, foo => baz).

       The "foo => bar" is masked by the "closer" "foo => baz".

   list_attributes_recursively($file, [$top])
       Returns a list of attributes that are defined and apply to $file.  Like
       "keys get_attributes_recursively($file, [$top])", but faster.

NOTABLY ABSENT FUNCTIONS
   unset_attribute_recursively
       There are two possible ways for this function to behave -- either
       recurse until the attribute is removed, or recurse to "top", removing
       the attribute at each level.  The first doesn't make sense, and the
       second is dangerous.  If you need this function, write it for the
       specific needs of your application; I think that's the safest thing to
       do.

       (Note that "rm" refuses to "rm ..", so I think there's some precedent
       here.)
