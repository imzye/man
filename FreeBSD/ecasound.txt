DESCRIPTION
       Ecatools are simple command line utils for audio file processing.  Each
       tool is designed to perform one specific operation. Most of the tools
       also support batch processing.

       ECACONVERT

       A tool for converting a set of files to a common target format.  This
       target format is given as the first command line argument, and its
       syntax is .ext.

       ECAFIXDC

       A simple command-line tool for fixing DC-offset.

       ECALENGTH

       See the separate ecalength(1) man page.

       ECAMONITOR

       Ecamonitor is a util program that can be used to monitor an active
       ecasound session. Ecamonitor is able to show information about the
       current chainsetup such as list of inputs, outputs, current position,
       effects, the engine status and numerous other things.

       By default ecamonitor will try to connect to IP4 address "localhost",
       to port "2868".  A different address can be specified when starting
       ecamonitor, for example "ecamonitor foo.mynetwork.com" or "ecamonitor
       foo.mynetwork.com:4500".

       To enable inbound connections, ecasound has to be started with the
       --daemon option. Ecamonitor is implemented in Python using the NetECI
       API.

       ECANORMALIZE

       Ecanormalize is a command-line tool for normalizing audio files to
       utilize the full available sample resolution. Ecanormalize first finds
       out how much the input file can be amplified without clipping and if
       there is room for increase, a static gain will be applied to the file.

       ECAPLAY

       Ecaplay is a command-line tool for playing audio files. Ecaplay uses
       the libecasound engine and is thus able to handle all audio formats
       supported by the library.

       Files can be selected for playback either by specifying the filenames
       on the command-line, or by using the playlist mechanism. In playlist
       mode, files can be added to the playlist using the -q option. The -p
       option can then be used to play all tracks on the playlist. Ecaplay
       will repeat the playlist tracks until explicitly stopped (with double
       Ctrl-C).  Playlist can be flushed with -f and its contents listed with
       -l option.

       If not otherwise specified, ecaplay will use the audio output device
       specified in ~/.ecasound/ecasoundrc for playback. A different output
       device can be selected with ECAPLAY_OUTPUT_DEVICE shell environment
       variable or with the -o:output_device command-line option.

       Playback can be stopped at any time with Ctrl-C. If multiple files are
       played, first Ctrl-C will stop the current file and move on to play the
       next one. Issuing Ctrl-C twice (within one second), will cause ecaplay
       to exit.

       -d:debuglevel
              Set libecasound debug level. See ecasound(1).

       -f     Flush the playlist contents. See also options -l, -p and -q.

       -h     Print usage information and exit.

       -k:number
              Skip ’number’ of files.

       -l     List the current playlist contents to stdout. See also options
              -f, -p and -q.

       -o:output_device
              Use ’output_device’ instead of the default output device (as
              specified in ~/.ecasound/ecasoundrc). Syntax is same as used by
              "-o" ecasound option (see ecasound(1) man page).  This option
              overrides the ECAPLAY_OUTPUT_DEVICE environment variable (more
              info below).

       -p     Play tracks in the playlist (in looped mode). See also options
              -f, -l and -q.

       -q     Queue new tracks to the playlist. All filenames given on the
              command-line will be added to the the playlist. It is possible
              to queue new tracks while another instance of ecaplay is using
              the playlist. See also options -f, -l and -p.

              ECASIGNALVIEW

       Ecasignalview is meant for monitoring signal amplitude and peak
       statistics. It accepts the following options:

       input  The first option not starting with a ’-’ is interpreted as an
              input string. This can be a device or a filename. All formats
              supported by libecasound are accepted. Defaults to ’/dev/dsp’.

       output Similarly to input, second option not starting with a ’-’ is
              interpreted as output. Defaults to ’null’.

       -b:buffersize
              Buffersize in sample frames. Defaults to 128.

       -c     Enable cumulative mode. Counters are not reseted after refresh.
              *deprecated*

       -d     Enable debug mode.

       -f:format_string
              Specify default audio format. See ecasound(1) for details.

       -r:rate_msec
              Specify screen refresh rate in milliseconds.

       -I     Use linear scale for showing audio sample amplitude.

       -L     Use logarithmic scale for showing audio sample amplitude.

       -G, -B, -M*, -r, -z
              Ecasound options use to modify the engine behaviour, see
              ecasound(1) manpage for details.

              When ecasignalview is running, the following keyboard commands
              can be used to control the operation (requires system support
              for UNIX terminal interface control):

       spacebar
              Reset statistics (max-peak, avg-amplitude and clipped samples
              count).

       q or Q or Esc
              Quit ecasignalview.

              It is also possible to reset the max-peak and clipped-samples
              counters by sending a SIGHUP signal to the process (i.e.  from
              another console: "killall -v -HUP ecasignalview").

       More complete documentation for ecasignalview can be found from
       "Ecasound User’s Guide" (see ’’http://nosignal.fi/ecasound ->
       Documentation’’).

       ~/.ecasound/ecasoundrc The default ecasound resource file. See
       ecasoundrc(5) for details.

       ~/.ecasound/ecaplay_queue File used to store the ecaplay playlist (one
       track per line with full path).
