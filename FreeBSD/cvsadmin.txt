NAME
       cvsadmin - administrate users of a CVS repository

SYNOPSIS
       cvsadmin [options] [action] [parameters]

DESCRIPTION
       cvsadmin is a program to administer users of a CVS repository easily.
       You can use it to administer a local or a remote repository (see the -c
       option).  There can be at most one option per invocation, since there
       are no way to distinguish between action name and parameters).

       Options modify general how cvsadmin works generally.

       c       This tells cvsadmin to use cvs(1) to checkout the files.  This
               allows you to administer a remote repository, to use SSH, etc.
               (just like your normal CVS setup works)

       C       This tells cvsadmin to accept pre-encrypted hashes instead of
               plain-text passwords when changing password, adding users, etc.
               This is good for administrators that don't want to see their
               users' passwords.

       d <repository>
               Tells cvsadmin what CVS repository location to use.  By
               default, it uses $CVSROOT, and if it's not set, defaults to
               :local:/usr/local/cvsroot

       v       Shows cvsadmin 's version

       Actions can be any of :

           add  - Add users, parameters are user names
           list - List users, no parameters
           del  - Delete users, parameters are user names
           email - Change users' email addresses, parameters are user names
           rename  - Rename users, parameters are pairs of old/new usernames
           misc - Do misc change on a user's account, parameters are user names
           sys - Change users' system username, parameters are usernames
           pass - Change users' passwords, parameters are usernames

EXAMPLES
        Here is a sample session that will give you a good idea about how
       cvsadmin works.

               % cvsadmin list
               No users in database
               Can't get users list
               % cvsadmin add foo
               User foo
               Password? [entering password, not shown on screen]
               System user? [] foouser
               Email address? foo@foo.com
               % cvsadmin list
               foo<foo@foo.com>: foouser on sys
               % cvsadmin email foo
               New email for foo? foo@bar.com
               % cvsadmin list
               foo<foo@bar.com>: foouser on sys
               % cvsadmin sys foo
               New system user for foo? [foouser] ? blah
               % cvsadmin list
               foo<foo@bar.com>: blah on sys
               % cvsadmin misc foo
               User foo
               Password? [nothing entered, keep current]
               System user? [blah] [nothing entered, keep current]
               Email address? [foo@bar.com] foo@newbar.com
               % cvsadmin list
               foo<foo@newbar.com>: blah on sys
