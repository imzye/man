X-ON-RESIZE(1)          FreeBSD General Commands Manual         X-ON-RESIZE(1)

NAME
       x-on-resize - monitor for hotplug or screen reconfigure events

SYNOPSIS
       x-on-resize [--help] [--display display] [--config config-script]
       [--resize resize-script] [--start]

DESCRIPTION
       X-on-resize is used to monitor the X display for output configuration
       changes and/or screen resize events. When these occur, it can call
       external programs to respond to the new display environment.


OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Print out a summary of the usage and exit.

       -d, --display name
              This option selects the X display to use. Note this refers to
              the X screen abstraction, not the monitor (or output).

       -c, --config config-script
              This option selects the external script to run when the set of
              available outputs has changed. If not provided, x-on-resize
              prints "config" on stdout.

       -r, --resize resize-script
              This option selects the external script to run when the size of
              the root window has changed. If not provided, x-on-resize prints
              "resize" on stdout.

       -a, --auto
              This is the same as --config "xrandr --auto", which sets the
              system to a reasonable configuration each time the connected set
              of outputs changes.

       -s, --start
              This directs x-on-resize to run any defined scripts at startup
              time in addition to when the specified conditions occur.
