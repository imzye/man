TECO(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual (con)             TECO(1)

NAME
     teco – The grand old text editor

SYNOPSIS
     tecoc make [-noini] [-nomemory] file
     tecoc teco [-inspect] [-nocreate] [-noini] [-nomemory] [-nopage]
     [-norename] [+nnn] file
     tecoc mung [-noini] file

DESCRIPTION
     This description section is sufficiently long that it has been split into
     a number of subsections.

   Command names
     teco is actually invoked by the command tecoc.  It takes a first argument
     of make, teco, or mung to control its operating mode. In the FreeBSD
     version, the base name of the invoking command is tested to provide this
     first argument. For ease of use, it is recommended that aliases are set
     up. The recommended (and usual) mappings are:

     Make     to tecoc make (note the uppercase first letter to avoid
              confusion with make(1))

     teco     to tecoc teco

     mung     to tecoc mung

     inspect  to tecoc teco -inspect

     These mappings are assumed in the Options and Command invocations
     sections below.

   Options
     Options may be abbreviated; for each option, the part shown in brackets
     can be omitted.  The following options are available for the teco
     command:

     -in[spect]
               read the file only, don't create an output file.

     -noc[reate]
               if the file doesn't exist, don't create it.

     -noi[ni]  don't execute the initialisation file. This is valid for Make
               or mung as well.

     -nom[emory]
               don't remember the filename (see Filename memory below). This
               is valid for Make also.

     -nop[age]
               don't separate input into pages. Instead, treat form feeds as
               normal characters.

     -nor[ename]
               don't rename files, but copy them to keep references correct

     +nnn      where nnn is any number of digits. Go to line number nnn and
               set -nopage.

   Command invocations
     There are a number of different ways of starting teco.

     Make file
             starts teco to create file.
             This is equivalent to EWfile$$

     teco file
             starts teco to edit file.
             This is equivalent to EBfile$Y$$

     teco file2=file1
             starts teco to edit file1, writing to file2.
             This is equivalent to ERfile1$EWfile2$Y$$

     teco    starts teco to edit the last edited file.  By default, the name
             of that file is saved in a file named tecoN.tmp in the current
             directory, where N is the process ID of the parent process to
             teco.  This can be overridden, as described in Filename memory
             below.

     mung file args
             starts teco to execute file.
             This is equivalent to I<args>$JEIfile$$
             Instead of mung, the command teco @file args can be used.

   Key Bindings
     The keys mentioned in the teco.doc file are somewhat confusing. This
     should help:

     <DELIM>   The Esc echoes as $, however the teco.doc file shows it as `.

     <BS>      Type as Control-H; this isn't the Backspace key.

     <DELETE>  The Backspace key; this isn't the Delete key.

     <CR>      The Enter key.

     <LF>      Type as Control-J.

     Note that the assignments for <BS> and <DELETE> shown here are swapped.
     <BS> can be Backspace and <DELETE> can be Control-H by clearing ET&2048,
     e.g.  2048,0ET

   Initialisation file
     teco mungs (executes as teco commands) the file TECO.INI (yes, in
     uppercase) in the current directory before processing the command line.
     Initialisation can be done instead by defining an environment variable
     named TEC_INIT.  The value is either the list of teco commands to
     execute, or a $ followed by the pathname of the initialisation file. This
     allows a single, centrally located initialisation file. Remember that the
     $ must be escaped with a backslash character.

     The initialisation file can be used to make initial settings. It can
     return a value, but the value setting is somewhat obscure.

     For example, the following will both cause successful searches to auto-
     display in all teco sessions.

           Example (csh):   setenv TEC_INIT 1es
           Example (bash):  TEC_INIT=1es
                            export TEC_INIT

     The following will each cause the file ~/.tecrc to be used as the
     initialisation file.
           Example (csh):   setenv TEC_INIT \$~/.tecrc
           Example (bash):  TEC_INIT=\$~/.tecrc
                            export TEC_INIT

   Filename memory
     teco tries to remember the last file that it edited, so that after a file
     has been edited once, it can be re-edited without the file name having to
     be repeated on the command line.  teco implements this by writing and
     reading a file that contains the name of the last file edited. By
     default, the file name is tecoN.tmp in the current directory, where N is
     the process ID of the parent process to teco.

     To change the location of the memory file, define the environment
     variable TEC_MEMORY to be $ followed by the pathname of the file to be
     designated as the memory file.  Remember that the $ must be escaped with
     a backslash character.

     The following examples will cause the name of the last file edited to be
     stored in the file teco.mem in the home directory.

           Example (csh):   setenv TEC_MEMORY \$~/teco.mem
           Example (bash):  TEC_MEMORY=\$~/teco.mem
                            export TEC_MEMORY

   Library directory
     The environment variable TEC_LIBRARY can be set to be a directory path
     (including the final /); the path must be preceded by a $ character. This
     allows the EI command to fetch teco commands from this directory if the
     file is not found in the current directory. Remember that the $ must be
     escaped with a backslash character.

           Example (csh):   setenv TEC_LIBRARY \$/usr/local/lib/
           Example (bash):  TEC_LIBRARY=\$/usr//usr/local/lib/
                            export TEC_LIBRARY

     This will cause the directory /usr/local/lib to be searched for teco
     command files.

   Implemented flags
     There are a number of flags that can be set inside teco, using the ED and
     ET mode control commands. To add functionality, teco is also sensitive to
     bits in an extra mode control flag, EZ.  Bits in the EZ mode control
     command are used in different ways by different operating systems; only
     those relevant to FreeBSD are described here.

           ED&1      Allow the caret ^ character in string searches.
           ED&2      Allow yank and _ unconditionally.
           ED&16     Failed searches preserve dot.
           ED&64     Move dot by one after each match in multiple occurrence
                     searches.

           ET&1      Type out in image mode.
           ET&2      Use scope for delete and Control-U (default=1)
           ET&4      Accept lowercase input (default=1).
           ET&8      Control-T reads without echo.
           ET&32     Control-T reads with no wait.
           ET&128    mung mode (abort on error); cleared by * prompt.
           ET&2048   Swap backspace and delete.
           ET&4096   We are using 8 bit characters (default=1).
           ET&32768  Trap Control-C.

           EZ&128    If set, don't stop on form feeds when reading. If clear,
                     a form feed in the input stream stops the read (the
                     standard teco style).  This bit is off by default.
           EZ&256    If set, use UNIX-style newline terminators. This means
                     when files are read in, carriage-returns are not added to
                     the end of lines, and when the user types the RETURN key,
                     only a newline is entered into the command line (usually
                     a carriage-return/line-feed pair is entered). Old macros
                     (and old teco users) may get confused if this bit is set.
           EZ&16384  Normally, the backup file name is created by replacing
                     the file extension with .bak - foo.c becomes foo.bak;
                     however, if this bit is set then the backup file name is
                     created by simply adding .bak to the name - foo.c becomes
                     foo.c.bak.  This choice is overridden by EZ&1 = 0.

ENVIRONMENT
     The following environment variables are used by teco:

     TECO_INIT     The value of this variable can be either a teco command
                   string, or the name of a file containing teco commands. The
                   filename must be preceded by a $ character. Remember that
                   the $ must be escaped with a backslash character.  See also
                   Initialisation file.

     TECO_LIBRARY  The value of this variable should be a path to the
                   directory that contains files of teco commands, to be
                   accessed using XX.  The pathname should include the
                   trailing /.  Remember that the $ must be escaped with a
                   backslash character.  See also Library directory.

     TECO_MEMORY   The value of this variable should be the name of a file To
                   be used for remembereing the name of the last file edited
                   by teco.  The filename must be preceded by a $ character.
                   Remember that the $ must be escaped with a backslash
                   character.  See also Filename memory.

SEE ALSO
     A variety of documentation files may be installed in
     /usr/local/share/doc/teco.  Apart from the ones mentioned in the FILES
     section, they are  of limited use, because they refer to slightly
