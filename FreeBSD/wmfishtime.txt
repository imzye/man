NAME
       wmfishtime - dockable clock app for WMaker, BlackBox, E, SawFish etc.
       window manager

SYNOPSIS
       wmfishtime

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the wmfishtime command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
       because the original program does not have a manual page. It originated
       from the original source README file (see authors).

       wmfishtime is a dockable clock application for WMaker, BlackBox, E,
       SawFish etc.  window manager.

       The features include gradient backdrop, anti-aliased hour|minute|second
       hands, alpha-blended bubbles, a real-time sprite engine, precision
       accuracy and indicates unread mail (in the form of swaying weed
       blocking the day/month numbers).

       Well, this is just your standard time dockapp. Top part has the clock
       face, bottom part has day of the week, followed by day, followed by
       month. Yellow hand counts seconds, green hand counts minutes, red hand
       counts hours. Few seconds after startup there are at least 32 bubbles
       floating up behind the clock face.  There are 4 fishes randomly
       swimming back and forth. If you move your mouse inside the dockapp
       window, the fish will get scared and run away.  If you enabled mail
       checking (disabled for default), then whenever you get new mail in the
       file pointed to by the $MAIL variable, it will display green weed
       partially blocking the day/month counter, to remind you to read your
       mail.  If $MAIL is not set, nothing happens.
