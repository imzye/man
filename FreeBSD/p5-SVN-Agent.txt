NAME
       SVN::Agent - simple svn manipulation.

SYNOPSIS
         use SVN::Agent;

         my $sa = SVN::Agent->load({ path => 'my_checkout_dir' });

         # find out modified files
         print join(',', @{ $sa->modified }) . "\n";

         # usual svn operations
         $sa->add('file.pl');
         $sa->commit("Message");

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides regular svn operations on check out directory. It
       tries to do this in a simplest form possible.

       All operations are currently performed by running svn binary directly.
       Thus it is probably unportable.

       For a much more powerful way of working with svn repository see
       SVN::Client.
