NAME
       qqwing - A tool for generating and solving Sudoku puzzles


SYNOPSIS
       qqwing --generate [OPTIONS...]
       qqwing --solve [OPTIONS...]


DESCRIPTION
       qqwing is a Sudoku puzzle generator and solver. It offers the following
       features:

       • Fast. It can solve 1000 puzzles in 1 second and generate 1000 puzzles
       in 25 seconds.

       • Uses logic. Uses as many solve techniques as possible when solving
       puzzles rather than guessing.

       • Rates puzzles. Most generators don't give an indication of the
       difficulty of a Sudoku puzzle. QQwing does.

       • Can print solve instructions. Tells steps that need to be taken to
       solve any puzzle.

       • Customizable output style, including a CSV style that is easy to
       import into a database.
