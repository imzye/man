     viapm – VIA chipsets Power Management controller driver

SYNOPSIS
     device iicbb
     device iicbus
     device iicsmb
     device smbus
     device smb
     device viapm

DESCRIPTION
     This driver provides access to the VIA chipset Power Management Unit
     family.  They are VT82C586B, VT82C596A, VT82C596B, VT82C686A and VT8233.

     The embedded controller of the VIA chipset may give you access to the
     monitoring facilities of your mainboard.

     The 586B support is made by software whereas other controllers support
     the SMBus protocol by hardware.  See smb(4) for writing user code to
     fetch voltages, temperature and so on from the monitoring chip of your
     mainboard.
