NAME
       HOP::Lexer - "Higher Order Perl" Lexer

VERSION
       Version 0.032

SYNOPSIS
        use HOP::Lexer 'string_lexer';

        my @input_tokens = (
            [ 'VAR',   qr/[[:alpha:]]+/    ],
            [ 'NUM',   qr/\d+/             ],
            [ 'OP',    qr/[+=]/            ],
            [ 'SPACE', qr/\s*/, sub { () } ],
        );

        my $text  = 'x = 3 + 4';
        my $lexer = string_lexer( $text, @input_tokens );

        my @tokens;
        while ( my $token = $lexer->() ) {
            push @tokens, $token;
        }

EXPORT
       Two functions may be exported, "make_lexer" and "string_lexer".

FUNCTIONS
   make_lexer
        my $lexer = make_lexer( $input_iterator, @tokens );

       The "make_lexer" function expects an input data iterator as the first
       argument and a series of tokens as subsequent arguments. It returns a
       stream of lexed tokens. The output tokens are two element arrays:

        [ $label, $matched_text ]

       The iterator should be a subroutine reference that returns the next
       value merely by calling the subroutine with no arguments.  If you have
       a single block of text in a scalar that you want lexed, see the
       "string_lexer" function.

       The input @tokens array passed into "make_lexer" is expected to be a
       list of array references with two mandatory items and one optional one:

        [ $label, qr/$match/, &transform ]

       •   $label

           The $label is the name used for the first item in an output token.

       •   $match

           The $match is either an exact string or regular expression which
           matches the text the label is to identify.

       •   &transform

           The &transform subroutine reference is optional. If supplied, this
           will take the matched text and should return a token matching an
           output token or an empty list if the token is to be discarded. For
           example, to discard whitespace (the label is actually irrelevant,
           but it helps to document the code):

            [ 'WHITESPACE', /\s+/, sub {()} ]

           The two arguments supplied to the transformation subroutine are the
           label and value. Thus, if we wish to force all non-negative
           integers to have a unary plus, we might do something like this:

            [
              'REVERSED INT',  # the label
              /[+-]?\d+/,      # integers with an optional unary plus or minus
              sub {
                my ($label, $value) = @_;
                $value = "+$value" unless $value =~ /^[-+]/;
                [ $label, $value ]
              }
            ]

       For example, let's say we want to convert the string "x = 3 + 4" to the
       following tokens:

         [ 'VAR', 'x' ]
         [ 'OP',  '=' ]
         [ 'NUM', 3   ]
         [ 'OP',  '+' ]
         [ 'NUM', 4   ]

       One way to do this would be with the following code:

         my $text = 'x = 3 + 4';
         my @text = ($text);
         my $iter = sub { shift @text };

         my @input_tokens = (
             [ 'VAR',   qr/[[:alpha:]]+/    ],
             [ 'NUM',   qr/\d+/             ],
             [ 'OP',    qr/[+=]/            ],
             [ 'SPACE', qr/\s*/, sub { () } ],
         );

         my $lexer = make_lexer( $iter, @input_tokens );

         my @tokens;
         while ( my $token = $lexer->() ) {
             push @tokens, $token;
         }

       @tokens would contain the desired tokens.

       Note that the order in which the input tokens are passed in might cause
       input to be lexed in different ways, thus the order is significant
       ("/\w+/" might slurp up numbers before "/\b\d+\b/" can read them).

   string_lexer
        my $lexer = string_lexer( $string, @tokens );

       This function is identical to "make_lexer", but takes a string as the
       first argument.  This is merely syntactic sugar for the common case
       where we have our data in a string but don't want to create an
       iterator.  The following are equivalent.

        my $lexer = string_lexer( $text, @input_tokens );

       Versus:

        my @text  = ($text);
        my $iter  = sub { shift @text };
        my $lexer = make_lexer( $iter, @input_tokens );

DEBUGGING
       The following caveats (or pitfalls, if you prefer), should be kept in
       mind while lexing data.

       •   Unlexed data

           The tokens returned by the lexer are array references.  If any data
           cannot be lexed, it will be returned as a string, unchanged.

       •   Capturing parens

           Internally, Hop::Lexer uses capturing parentheses to extract the
           data from the provided regular expressions.  If you need to group
           data in regular expressions, use the non-capturing parentheses
           "(?:...)".  Otherwise, your code will break.

       •   Precedence

           It's important to note that the order of the described tokens is
           important.  If you have keywords such as "while", "if", "unless",
           and so on, and any text which matches "qr/[[:word:]]+/" is
           considered a variable, the following fails:

             my @input_tokens = (
                 [ 'VAR',     qr/[[:word:]]+/         ],
                 [ 'KEYWORD', qr/(?:while|if|unless)/ ],
             );

           This is because the potential keywords will be matched as "VAR".
           To deal with this, place the higher precedence tokens first:

             my @input_tokens = (
                 [ 'KEYWORD', qr/(?:while|if|unless)/ ],
                 [ 'VAR',     qr/[[:word:]]+/         ],
             );
