DESCRIPTION
       Apache::XMLRPC serves Userland XML-RPC requests from Apache/mod_perl
       using the Frontier::RPC2 module.

       Configuring Apache::XMLRPC to work under mod_perl is a two step
       process.  First, you must declare a "<Location>" directive in your
       Apache configuration file which tells Apache to use the content handler
       found in the Apache::XMLRPC module and defines a variable which tells
       the module where to find your services.  Then, you must define the
       services.

   Apache Configuration
       Apache configuration is as simple as the "<Location>" directive shown
       in the synopsis above.  Any directive allowed by Apache inside a
       "<Location>" block is allowed here, but the three lines shown above are
       required.  Pay close attention to the 'PerlSetVar XMLRPC_Config ...'
       line as this is where you tell Apache where to find your services.
       This file may reside anywhere accessable by Apache.

   Defining Services
       To actually define the XML-RPC routines that will be served, they must
       reside in the file referenced by the 'PerlSetVar XMLRPC_Config ...'
       directive in the Apache configuration file.  In this file you may place
       as many Perl subroutines as you like, but only those which are
       explicitly published will be available to your XML-RPC clients.

       To publish a subroutine, it must be included in the hash reference
       named $map (the hash reference must have this name as this is the
       variable that the Apache::XMLRPC passes to Frontier::RPC2::serve to
       actually service each request) The hash reference must be defined in
       this "services" file.

       The keys of the hash are the service names visible to the XML-RPC
       clients while the hash values are references to the subroutines you
       wish to make public.  There is no requirement that the published
       service names match those of their associated subroutines, but it does
       make administration a little easier.
