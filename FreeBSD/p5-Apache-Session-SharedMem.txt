Apache::Session::SharedMem(3)              User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Apache::Session::SharedMem - Session management via shared memory

SYNOPSIS
        use Apache::Session::SharedMem;

        tie %s, 'Apache::Session::SharedMem', $sessionid, { expires_in => 86400 }

DESCRIPTION
       This module is an implementation of Apache::Session. It uses IPC::Cache
       to store session variables in shared memory.

       The advantage of this is that it is fairly fast (about the same speed,
       if not faster than Apache::Session::File and is very easy to set up
       making it perfect for when you want to test sessions but can't be
       bothered to set up a database or don't want cgi scripts writing temp
       files.

   CAVEATS
       It probably isn't very scaleable (i.e you probably shouldn't use this
       in production code which is going to get hit hard.

       I have no idea if it leaks memory yet. I've only just written it :)

       Apparently it IPC::ShareLite (and hence IPC::Cache) don't work under
       Perl 5.6.

USAGE
       Just the same as all the other Apache::Session modules. You can
       optionally pass the parameter expires_in which will tell the Session to
       expire in a certain time.

PREREQUISITES
       Apache::Session::SharedMem needs Apache::Session and IPC:Cache, both
       available from the CPAN.
