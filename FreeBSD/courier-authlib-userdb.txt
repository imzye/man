MAKEUSERDB(8)               Double Precision, Inc.               MAKEUSERDB(8)

NAME
       makeuserdb - create /usr/local/etc/userdb

SYNOPSIS
       makeuserdb [-f filename]

       pw2userdb

       vchkpw2userdb [--vpopmailhome=dir] [--todir=dir]

DESCRIPTION
       makeuserdb creates /usr/local/etc/userdb.dat from the contents of
       /usr/local/etc/userdb.  /usr/local/etc/userdb's contents are described
       later in this document.  Maildrop, Courier, and other applications use
       /usr/local/etc/userdb.dat as a substitute/complement for your system
       password file. The usual purpose for /usr/local/etc/userdb.dat is to
       specify "virtual" accounts - accounts that do not have an associated
       system login. Usually (but not necessarily) all virtual accounts share
       the same system userid.  /usr/local/etc/userdb.dat may also replace
       your system password file. Because the system password file is a text
       file, when there's a large number of accounts it will be significantly
       faster to search @userdb.dat@, which is a binary database, instead of a
       flat text file that the system password file usually is.

       The makeuserdb command can be safely executed during normal system
       activity.

       The -f option creates filename.dat from filename, instead of the
       default /usr/local/etc/userdb.dat from /usr/local/etc/userdb.

   Format of /usr/local/etc/userdb
       /usr/local/etc/userdb is a plain text file that can be created using
       any text editor. Blank lines are ignored. Lines that start with the #
       character are comments, and are also ignored. Other lines define
       properties of a single "account", one line per account.
       /usr/local/etc/userdb may be a directory instead of a plain file. In
       that case all files in /usr/local/etc/userdb are essentially
       concatenated, and are treated as a single file. Each line takes the
       following format:

           name<TAB>field=value|field=value...

       name is the account name.  name MUST contain only lowercase characters
       If Courier is configured to treat lowercase and uppercase account names
       as identical, name is followed by exactly one tab character, then a
       list of field/value pairs separated by vertical slashes.  field is the
       name of the field, value is the field value. Fields and values themself
       cannot contain slashes or control characters. Fields may be specified
       in any order. Here are all the currently defined fields. Note that not
       every field is used by every application that reads
       /usr/local/etc/userdb.dat.

       uid - value is a (possibly) unique numerical user ID for this account.

       gid - value is a (possibly) unique numerical group ID for this account.

       home - value is the account's home directory.

       shell - value is the account's default login shell.

       systempw - value is the account's password. See userdbpw(8)[1] for
       details on how to set up this field.

       pop3pw, esmtppw, imappw... - value specifies a separate password used
       only for authenticating access using a specific service, such as POP3,
       IMAP, or anything else. If not defined, systempw is always used. This
       allows access to an account to be restricted only to certain services,
       such as POP3, even if other services are also enabled on the server.

       mail - value specifies the location of the account's Maildir mailbox.
       This is an optional field that is normally used when userdb is used to
       provide aliases for other mail accounts. For example, one particular
       multi-domain E-mail service configuration that's used by both Qmail and
       Courier servers is to deliver mail for a mailbox in a virtual domain,
       such as "user@example.com", to a local mailbox called "example-user".
       Instead of requiring the E-mail account holder to log in as
       "example-user" to download mail from this account, a userdb entry for
       "user@example.com" is set up with mail set to the location of
       example-user's Maildir mailbox, thus hiding the internal mail
       configuration from the E-mail account holder's view.

       quota - value specifies the maildir quota for the account's Maildir.
       This has nothing to do with actual filesystem quotas.  Courier has a
       software-based Maildir quota enforcement mechanism which requires
       additional setup and configuration. See maildirquota(7)[2] for
       additional information.

   /usr/local/etc/userdbshadow.dat
       All fields whose name ends with 'pw' will NOT copied to
       /usr/local/etc/userdb.dat. These fields will be copied to
       /usr/local/etc/userdbshadow.dat.  makeuserdb creates
       /usr/local/etc/userdbshadow.dat without any group and world
       permissions. Note that makeuserdb reports an error if
       /usr/local/etc/userdb has any group or world permissions.

   CONVERTING /etc/passwd and vpopmail to /usr/local/etc/userdb format
       pw2userdb reads the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files and converts all
       entries to the /usr/local/etc/userdb format, printing the result on
       standard output. The output of pw2userdb can be saved as
       /usr/local/etc/userdb (or as some file in this subdirectory). Linear
       searches of /etc/passwd can be very slow when you have tens of
       thousands of accounts. Programs like maildrop always look in
       /usr/local/etc/userdb first. By saving the system password file in
       /usr/local/etc/userdb it is possible to significantly reduce the amount
       of time it takes to look up this information.

       After saving the output of pw2userdb, you must still run makeuserdb to
       create /usr/local/etc/userdb.dat.

       vchkpw2userdb converts a vpopmail-style directory hierarchy to the
       /usr/local/etc/userdb format. This is an external virtual domain
       management package that's often used with Qmail servers.

       Generally, an account named 'vpopmail' is reserved for this purpose. In
       that account the file users/vpasswd has the same layout as /etc/passwd,
       and performs a similar function, except that all userid in
       users/vpasswd have the same userid. Additionally, the domains
       subdirectory stores virtual accounts for multiple domains. For example,
       domains/example.com/vpasswd has the passwd file for the domain
       example.com. Some systems also have a soft link, domains/default, that
       points to a domain that's considered a "default" domain.

       The vchkpw2userdb reads all this information, and tries to convert it
       into the /usr/local/etc/userdb format. The --vpopmailhost option
       specifies the top level directory, if it is not the home directory of
       the vpopmail account.

       The vchkpw2userdb script prints the results on standard output. If
       specified, the --todir option tries to convert all vpasswd files one at
       a time, saving each one individually in dir. For example:

           mkdir /usr/local/etc/userdb
           vchkpw2userdb --todir=/usr/local/etc/userdb/vpopmail
           makeuserdb

       It is still necessary to run makeuserdb, of course, to create the
       binary database file /usr/local/etc/userdb.dat

       NOTE: You are still required to create the /usr/local/etc/userdb entry
       which maps system userids back to accounts, "uid=<TAB>name", if that's
       applicable.  vchkpw2userdb will not do it for you.

       NOTE: makeuserdb may complain about duplicate entries, if your
       "default" entries in users/vpasswd or domains/default/vpasswd are the
       same as anything in any other /usr/local/etc/userdb file. It is also
       likely that you'll end up with duplicate, but distinct, entries for
       every account in the default domain. For example, if your default
       domain is example.com, you'll end up with duplicate entries - you'll
       have entries for both user and user@example.com.

       If you intend to maintain the master set of accounts using
       vchkpw/vpopmail, in order to avoid cleaning this up every time, you
       might want to consider doing the following: run vchkpw2userdb once,
       using the --todir option. Then, go into the resulting directory, and
       replace one of the redundant files with a soft link to /dev/null. This
       allows you to run vchkpw2userdb without having to go in and cleaning up
       again, afterwards.

BUGS
       makeuserdb is a Perl script, and uses Perl's portable locking. Perl's
       documentation notes that certain combinations of locking options may
       not work with some networks.
