NPMount(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             NPMount(1)

NAME
       npmount - Non-privileged mount tool




SYNOPSIS
       npmount mount /mount/point
       npmount umount /mount/point



DESCRIPTION
       NPmount is a command-line tool to provide limited mount and unmount
       capabilities to non-privileged users, such as mounting and unmounting
       external media including optical discs and thumb drives.

       NPMount can be used directly from the command-line or as a platform-
       independent backend for GUI applications such as file managers and the
       qmediamanager(1) application.

       It is more convenient than other methods because it is fully portable,
       and never requires the user to enter a password.

       NPMount is safer than sudo, since it never allows the execution of
       arbitrary code under escalated privileges.  Only mount and umount
       commands for authorized mount points are ever run as root.


CONFIGURATION
       The configuration file is simple.  It indicates which mount points can
       be controlled by members of a given group.  The default configuration
       shown below indicates that members of the operator group can mount and
       unmount all directories under /media, which commonly contains mount
       points for USB sticks and optical discs.

       # Group     Mount-points
       operator    /media/*

       Mounting also requires that the mount point be listed in /etc/fstab or
       equivalent.  The Unix mount command is issued with a mount point alone.
       Most mounts of external media are performed by an automount service,
       anyway, so use of npmount to mount media should not often be necessary.

       Unmounting does not require a listing in /etc/fstab, since the Unix
       umount command needs only a mount point or device.


USAGE
       Using the configuration above as an example, members of the operator
       group can run the following without authenticating:

       npmount umount /media/cd0

       If /media/cd0 is configured in /etc/fstab or equivalent, then members
       of the operator group can also run

       npmount mount /media/cd0


FILES
       ${PREFIX}/etc/npmount.conf
