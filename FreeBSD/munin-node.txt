Name
       munin-get - a simple tool for managing plugins from remote repositories

Features
       The small management tool "munin-get" supports the following actions:

       clone one or more git repositories containing munin plugins
       multiple remote repositories can be used
       list all found plugins (including change timestamp and description)
       "install" a plugin (by default to: /var/munin/munin-get-plugins)
       "enable" a plugin (create a symlink to /usr/local/etc/munin/plugins/)
       upgrade plugins (and review changes before)

       The primary purpose of this tool is the simplification of the process
       of using plugins from munin's contrib repository.

Usage
       All actions except "install", "enable" and "disable" can be run as a
       regular user.  Please note that the non-privileged commands use
       directories relative to $HOME by default (can be overridden).  Thus
       sudo or a similar tool should be used for gaining privileges.  Of
       course, everything can also be done as root.

       The separate "install" step works around potential problems with
       systemd hardening flags or other security policies, which may prevent
       files in /root/ or below /home/ from being accessed by the "munin-node"
       service process.

Examples
   Discover, inspect, install, enable and test a plugin
           munin-get update
           munin-get list
           munin-get search throughput
           munin-get doc contrib/traffic
           munin-get install contrib/traffic
           munin-get enable contrib/traffic
           munin-run traffic
           service munin-node restart   # for systemd: systemctl restart munin-node

   Review and apply changes from the upstream repository
           munin-get update
           munin-get list-upgradeable
           munin-get diff-upgradeable
           munin-get upgrade

   Add custom 3rd party git repositories
           munin-get add-repository foo http://example.org/repos/munin-plugins.git
           munin-get add-repository bar http://example.org/repos/munin-stuff.git branch-tested plugins/
           munin-get update

Internals
       Repositories are cloned below ~/.cache/munin/munin-get/repositories
       (see REPOSITORY_CACHE_BASE_DIR).

       Manual changes in the cloned repositories should be avoided.

       The separate "install" and "enable" procedure is necessary due to
       possible process namespace / hardening features enabled for "munin-
       node". Thus the target of the symlink is located in a path that can be
       expected to be usable even for a restricted "munin-node" process.

       Additionally the separate "install" location allows the manual review
       of upstream changes before applying these locally.
