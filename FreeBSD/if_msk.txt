NAME
     msk – Marvell/SysKonnect Yukon II Gigabit Ethernet adapter driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device miibus
           device msk

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_msk_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The msk device driver provides support for various NICs based on the
     Marvell/SysKonnect Yukon II Gigabit Ethernet controller chip.

     All NICs supported by the msk driver have TCP/UDP/IP checksum offload for
     transmit, TCP segmentation offload (TSO), hardware VLAN tag
     stripping/insertion features and an interrupt moderation mechanism as
     well as a 64-bit multicast hash filter.  The Yukon II supports TBI (ten
     bit interface) and GMII transceivers, which means it can be used with
     either copper or 1000baseX fiber applications.

     The Yukon II also supports Jumbo Frames (up to 9022 bytes), which can be
     configured via the interface MTU setting.  Selecting an MTU larger than
     1500 bytes with the ifconfig(8) utility configures the adapter to receive
     and transmit Jumbo Frames.

     The msk driver supports the following media types:

     autoselect       Enable autoselection of the media type and options.  The
                      user can manually override the autoselected mode by
                      adding media options to rc.conf(5).

     10baseT/UTP      Set 10Mbps operation.  The ifconfig(8) mediaopt option
                      can also be used to select either full-duplex or
                      half-duplex modes.

     100baseTX        Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.  The ifconfig(8)
                      mediaopt option can also be used to select either
                      full-duplex or half-duplex modes.

     1000baseTX       Set 1000baseTX operation over twisted pair.  The
                      ifconfig(8) mediaopt option can also be used to select
                      either full-duplex or half-duplex modes.

     1000baseSX       Set 1000Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) operation.  Both
                      full-duplex and half-duplex modes are supported.

     The msk driver supports the following media options:

     full-duplex      Force full duplex operation.

     half-duplex      Force half duplex operation.

     For more information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

LOADER TUNABLES
     Tunables can be set at the loader(8) prompt before booting the kernel or
     stored in loader.conf(5).

     hw.msk.msi_disable
             This tunable disables MSI support on the Ethernet hardware.  The
             default value is 0.

SYSCTL VARIABLES
     The following variables are available as both sysctl(8) variables and
     loader(8) tunables:

     dev.mskc.%d.int_holdoff
             Maximum number of time to delay interrupts.  The valid range is 0
             to 34359738 for 125MHz clock in units of 1us, the default is 100
             (100us).  The interface need to be brought down and up again
             before a change takes effect.

     dev.mskc.%d.process_limit
             Maximum amount of Rx events to be processed in the event loop
             before rescheduling a taskqueue.  The accepted range is 30 to
             256, the default value is 128 events.  The interface does not
             need to be brought down and up again before a change takes
             effect.
