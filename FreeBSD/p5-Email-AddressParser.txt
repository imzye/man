Email::AddressParser(3)                    User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Email::AddressParser - RFC 2822 Address Parsing and Creation

SYNOPSIS
         use Email::AddressParser;

         my @addresses = Email::AddressParser->parse($line);
         my $address   = Email::AddressParser->new(Tony => 'tony@localhost');

         print $address->format;

VERSION
       version 0.01

DESCRIPTION
       This class is a near drop-in replacement for the regex parsing of
       Email::Address, which has serious issues for production use
       (exponential to infinite computation time in some cases). It uses code
       from Mark Crispin's c-client library to implement the parsing. The
       resulting parser is much more stable than the regex-based version of
       Email::Address.

       Note, RFC2822 comments are removed by this version (you can pass them
       in, and you can ask for them, but they will always be empty).

   Class Methods
       parse
             my @addrs = Email::Address->parse(
               q[me@local, Tony <me@local>, "Tony" <me@local>]
             );

           This method returns a list of "Email::Address" objects it finds in
           the input string.

           There are no comment nesting limitations on this method, though all
           comments will be ignored.

       new
             my $address = Email::Address->new(undef, 'tony@local');
             my $address = Email::Address->new('tony kay', 'tony@local');
             my $address = Email::Address->new(undef, 'tony@local', '(tony)');

           Constructs and returns a new "Email::AddressParser" object. Takes
           four positional arguments: phrase, email, and comment.

   Instance Methods
       phrase
             my $phrase = $address->phrase;
             $address->phrase( "Me oh my" );

           Accessor for the phrase portion of an address.

       address my $addr = $address->address; $addr->address(
       "me@PROTECTED.com" );
           Accessor for the address portion of an address.

       comment
             my $comment = $address->comment;
             $address->comment( "(Work address)" );

           Accessor for the comment portion of an address. Currently a no-op.

       format
             my $printable = $address->format;

           Returns a properly formatted RFC 2822 address representing the
           object.
