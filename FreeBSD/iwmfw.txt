IWMFW(4)               FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual               IWMFW(4)

NAME
     iwmfw – Firmware Module for Intel Wireless driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this module into the kernel, place the following line in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device iwmfw

     This will include firmware images for all iwm(4) devices inside the
     kernel.  If you want to pick only the firmware image for your network
     adapter choose one of the following:

           device iwm3160fw
           device iwm3168fw
           device iwm7260fw
           device iwm7265fw
           device iwm8000Cfw
           device iwm8265fw
           device iwm9000fw
           device iwm9260fw

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place one of
     the following lines in loader.conf(5):

           iwm3160fw_load="YES"
           iwm3168fw_load="YES"
           iwm7260fw_load="YES"
           iwm7265fw_load="YES"
           iwm7265Dfw_load="YES"
           iwm8000Cfw_load="YES"
           iwm8265fw_load="YES"
           iwm9000fw_load="YES"
           iwm9260fw_load="YES"
