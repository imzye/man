NAME
       dbmail-deliver - inserts messages into DBMail.

SYNOPSIS
       dbmail-deliver [common options] --to-address address [options]
       dbmail-deliver [common options] --to-header headerfield [options]
       dbmail-deliver [common options] --to-user usernames [options]

DESCRIPTION
       The dbmail-deliver program inserts messages from the commandline or
       from any MTA into DBMail. The program reads from standard input.

OPTIONS
       -d, --to-address addresses...
           Deliver messages to the recipients specified by addresses. This
           option is mostly used for delivery from an MTA. Separate multiple
           addresses by spaces.

       -t, --to-header headerfield
           Deliver messages to the recipient MIME header specified in
           headerfield. The default header to use is the "Delivered-To:"
           header. The headerfield should be lower case e.g. delivered-to

       -u, --to-user usernames...
           Deliver messages straight to the given username. Separate multiple
           usernames with spaces.

       -m, --mailbox mailboxname
           Deliver messages to mailbox mailboxname of the recipient. If this
           mailbox does not exist yet, it is created. Sieve scripts will be
           run normally, possibly altering the destination mailbox.

       -M, --mailbox-force mailboxname
           Deliver messages to mailbox mailboxname of the recipient. If this
           mailbox does not exist yet, it is created. Sieve scripts are not
           run. Permission checks are not performed for mailbox creation or
           message delivery.

       -r, return-path returnpath
           Set return path for bounces and other error reports to return path.

COMMON OPTIONS
       -f, --config configfile
           Specify an alternate config file.

           Use dbmail-<utility> --help to show the default location.

       -q, --quiet
           Quietly skip interactive prompts and helpful status messages which
           would otherwise be printed to stdout. Use two -q’s to silence
           errors which would otherwise be printed to stderr.

       -v, --verbose
           Operate verbosely. Some of the utilities in the DBMail suite can
           take two -v’s for extra verbosity. Those which don’t understand
           this convention won’t complain about having the extra -v and will
           simply operate at their normal verbosity.

       -V, --version
           Show the version and copyright, then exit.

       -h, --help
           Show a brief summary of options, then exit.
