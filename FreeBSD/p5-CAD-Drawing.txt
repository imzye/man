NAME
       CAD::Drawing - Methods to create, load, and save vector graphics

SYNOPSIS
       The primary intention of this module is to provide high-level
       operations for creating, loading, saving and manipulating vector
       graphics without having to be overly concerned about smile floormats.
       As the code has seen more use, it has also drifted into a general
       purpose geometry API.

       The syntax of this works something like the following:
           A simple example of a (slightly misbehaved) file converter:

             use CAD::Drawing;
             $drw = CAD::Drawing->new;
             $drw->load("file.dwg");
             my %opts = (
               layer => "smudge",
               height => 5,
               );
             $drw->addtext([10, 2, 5], "Kilroy was here", \%opts);
             $drw->save("file.ps");

           This is a very basic example, and will barely scratch the surface
           of this module's capabilities.  See the details for each function
           below and in the documentation for the backend modules.

SEE ALSO
       These modules are required by Drawing.pm and will be automatically
       included by the single use Drawing; statement.  No functions are
       exported to the main program's namespace (unless you try to use
       CAD::Drawing::Defined from your main code (don't do that.))

       CAD::Drawing::Defined
           Generally useful constants and definitions used throughout the
           CAD::Drawing toolkit.

       CAD::Drawing::Manipulate
           Entity manipulation methods.

       CAD::Drawing::Manipulate::Transform
           Matrix transform methods.

       CAD::Drawing::Manipulate::Graphics
           Deals with embedded image definitions.

       CAD::Drawing::Calculate
           Calculations and coordinate system transforms.

       CAD::Drawing::Calculate::Finite
           Fitting and bounding.

       CAD::Drawing::IO
           Input/Output plugin mechanism.

       All of the backend IO::* modules are optional, and will be
       automagically discovered as they are installed.  See CAD::Drawing::IO
       for details.

Constructor
   new
       Returns a blessed reference to a new CAD::Drawing object.

         $drw = CAD::Drawing->new(%options);

       %options becomes a part of the data structure, so be careful what you
       %ask for, because you'll get it (I check nothing!)

       Currently useful options:
       nocolortrack => 1
           Disables loading of colortrack hash (breaking select by color
           methods, but saving a few milliseconds of time on big drawings.)

       isbig => 1
           Stores geometry data in package global variables (one per object.)
           This allows programs to exit more quickly, but will result in
           memory leaks if used inside of a loop. Do not use this option if
           you expect the memory used by the object to be freed when it goes
           out of scope.

           The rule of thumb is:

             my $drw = CAD::Drawing->new(); # lexically scoped (in a loop or sub)
             or
             $drw = CAD::Drawing->new(isbig=>1); # $main::drw

add functions
       All of these take a small set of required arguments and a reference to
       an options hash.

       The standard options are as follows:

         layer     => $layername
         color     => $color (as name or number (0-256))
         linetype  => $linetype (marginally supported in most formats)
         id        => $id

   addline
       Add a line between @pts.  No special options.

         @pts = ([$x1, $y1], [$x2, $y2]);
         $drw->addline(\@pts, \%opts);

   add_x
       Adds an "X" to the drawing, with the intersection at @pt and each of
       the two legs having $length at $opt{ang}.

         @lines = $drw->add_x(\@pt, $length, \%opt);

   add_fake_ray
       Adds an open polyline which has a small hook (nubbin) at one end.  This
       can be used to represent a directional line (vector.)

         $drw->add_fake_ray(\@pts, \%opts);

       Options are the same as for addpolygon but closed is forced to false.

   addpolygon
       Add a polyline through (2D) @points.

         %opts = ( closed => BOOLEAN );
         $drw->addpolygon(\@points, \%opts);

   addrec
       A shortcut to addpolygon. Specify the opposite corners with @rec, which
       will look like a diagonal line of the rectangle.

         @rec = ( [$x1, $y1], [$x2, $y2] );

         $drw->addrec(\@rec, $opts);

   addtext
       Adds text $string at @pt.  Height should be specified in $opts{height},
       which may contain font and other options in the future.

         $drw->addtext(\@pt, $string, \%opts);

   addtextlines
       Returns @addr_list for new entities.

       Similar to the syntax of addtext() , but @point is the insert point for
       the top line.  The %opts hash should contain at least 'height' and
       'spacing', and can also include 'layer', 'color', and 'linetype' (but
       defaults can be automatically set for all of these.)

         $drw->addtextlines(\@point, "string\nstring\n", \%opts);

   addtexttable
       @table is a 2D array of strings.  $opts{spaces} must (currently)
       contain a ref to a list of column widths.

         $drw->addtexttable(\@point, \@table, \%opts);

   addpoint
         $drw->addpoint(\@pt, \%opts);

   addcircle
         $drw->addcircle(\@pt, $rad, \%opts);

   addarc
         $drw->addarc(\@pt, $rad, \@angs, \%opts);

   addimage
         $drw->addimage();

Query Functions
   getImgByName
   getLayerList
       Deprecated.  See list_layers().

         @list = $drw->getLayerList(\%opts);

   list_layers
       Get list of layers in drawing with options as follows:

         %options = (
           matchregex => qr/name/,
               );
         @list = $drw->list_layers(\%opts);

   addr_by_layer
       Returns a list of addresses for all objects on $layer.

         my @addr_list = $drw->addr_by_layer($layer);

   getAddrByLayer
       deprecated

   addr_by_type
       Returns a list of addresses for $type entities on $layer.

         $drw->addr_by_type($layer, $type);

   getAddrByType
       deprecated

   addr_by_regex
         @list = $drw->addr_by_regex($layer, qr/^model\s+\d+$/, $opts);

   getAddrByRegex
       deprecated

   addr_by_color
         @list = $drw->addr_by_color($layer, $type, $color);

   getAddrByColor
       deprecated

   getEntPoints
       Returns the point or points found at $addr as a list.

       If the entity has only one point, the list will be (x,y,z), while a
       many-pointed entity will give a list of the form ([x,y,z],[x,y,z]...)

         $drw->getEntPoints($addr);

   addr_by_id
         $drw->addr_by_id($layer, $type, $id);

   Get
       Gets the thing from entity found at $addr.

       Returns the value of the thing (even if it is a reference) with the
       exception of things that start with "p", which will result in a call to
       getEntPoints (and return a list.)

         $drw->Get("thing", $addr);

   Set
         $drw->Set(\%items, $addr);

Internal Functions
   setdefaults
       internal use only

       Performs in-place modification on \%opts and creates a new place for an
       entity of $type to live on $opt->{layer} with id $opts->{id} (opts are
       optional.)

         $drw->setdefaults($type, $opts);

   getobj
       Internal use only.

       Returns a reference to the entity found at $addr.

         $drw->getobj($addr);

   remove
       Removes the entity at $addr from the data structure.

         $drw->remove($addr);

   select_addr
       Selects geometric entities from the Drawing object based on the hash
       key-value pairs.  Aside from the options supported by check_select()
       this also supports the option "all", which, if true, will select all
       entities (this is the default if no hash reference is passed.)

       Furthermore, if you already have in-hand a list of addresses, if the
       reference passed is actually an array reference, it will be returned
       directly, or you can store this in $opts{addr_list} and that list will
       be returned.  This allows you to pass the list directly as part of a
       larger set of options, or by itself.

         $drw->select_addr(\%opts);
