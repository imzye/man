NAME
       pcheck - popcheck client

SYNOPSIS
       pcheck [-s SERVER, --server=SERVER] [-p PORT, --port=PORT] [-t TIMEOUT,
       --timeout=TIMEOUT] [--help] [--version]

DESCRIPTION
       This command is used for checking the proper function of the pcheckd.
       It will send a UDP request to the pcheckd running on the machine server
       (default: 127.0.0.1) on port port (default: 50110). It will wait for
       timeout seconds for an answer. The answer is printed on stdout.

       There are two types of requests: The mailbox request (-m) will ask the
       server about the state of the named mailbox and will output it ('0 no
       mail', '1 mail', '2 new mail', or '3 load too high'). The load request
       (-l) will ask the server for the load avarage for the last minute.

       The output of the command is the answer to the request returned by the
       server. It has the general format '+OK some message' if the request was
       successfull or '-ERR error message' if some error occured on the server
       side.
