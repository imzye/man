FUNCTIONS
   INDEXhash
       This parses the FreeBSD ports index file and a hash of it. Upon error
       it returns undef.

       If a path to it is not passed to this function, it chooses the file
       automatically. The PORTSDIR enviromental varaiable is respected if
       using automatically.

HASH FORMAT
       Each entry, minus 'originsN2D' and 'originsD2N'.

   ports hash
       info

       This is a short description of the port.

       prefix

       This is the install prefix the port will try to use.

       maintainer

       This is the email address for the port's maintainer.

       www

       This is the web site of a port inquestion.

       Edeps

       This is the extract depends of a port. This is a array.

       Bdeps

       This is the build depends for the port. This is a array.

       Pdeps

       This is the package depends for a port. This is a array.

       Rdeps

       This is the run depends of a port. This is a array.

       Fdeps

       This is the fetch depends of a port. This is a array.

       categories

       This is all the categories a specific port falls under. This is a
       array.

   originsN2D
       This contains a mapping of port names to the directory they are in.

   originsD2N
       This contains a mapping of directories to port names.

   soriginsD2N
       This is the same as 'originsD2N', but does not everything prior to the
       ports directory is removed. This is to make it easy for matching
       packages to ports.

   originsN2D
       This is the same as 'originsN2D', but does not everything prior to the
       ports directory is removed.
