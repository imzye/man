NAME
       btcheck - Bittorrent downloaded data checker

SYNOPSIS
       btcheck [ -h ] [ -V ] [ -v ] [ -q ] [ -n ] [ -z ] [ -i ] [ -l ]
       file.torrent


DESCRIPTION
       btcheck(1) is a tool to list torrent file content (torrent hash value,
       tracker announce, comments, files list with sizes) and to check hashes
       of downloaded data associated with this torrent file.

OPTIONS
       -h     Show summary of options and exit.

       -V     Show the current version number and exit.

       -v     Verbose output (can be used many times to increase verbosity
              level).

       -q     Quiet output, check success or failure is set in return code.

       -n     Do not check data (useful with -i option and default with -l).

       -z     Fill missing data with zeros when checking (this forces hash
              computation).

       -i     Show the content of the given torrent file. This includes the
              files list with their size, the tracker announce, the torrent
              hash value.

       -l     List filenames with size of the given torrent file and don't
              check data.

       file.torrent
              The torrent file to use.

EXAMPLES
       Here is some examples.

   DEFAULT USAGE (CHECKING MODE)
           btcheck foo.torrent


   LIST FILES DECLARED
           btcheck -l bar.torrent


NOTE
       This program tries to check data in the directory declared in torrent
       file. If this directory doesn't exist, check is done in the current
       directory.

BUGS
       None as far as I know.
