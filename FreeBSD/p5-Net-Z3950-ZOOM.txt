NAME
       Net::Z3950::ZOOM - Perl extension for invoking the ZOOM-C API.

SYNOPSIS
        use Net::Z3950::ZOOM;
        $conn = Net::Z3950::ZOOM::connection_new($host, $port);
        $errcode = Net::Z3950::ZOOM::connection_error($conn, $errmsg, $addinfo);
        Net::Z3950::ZOOM::connection_option_set($conn, databaseName => "foo");
        # etc.

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a simple thin-layer through to the ZOOM-C
       functions in the YAZ toolkit for Z39.50 and SRW/U communication.  You
       should not be using this very nasty, low-level API.  You should be
       using the "ZOOM" module instead, which implements a nice, Perlish API
       on top of this module, conformant to the ZOOM Abstract API described at
       http://zoom.z3950.org/api/

       To enforce the don't-use-this-module prohibition, I am not even going
       to document it.  If you really, really, really want to use it, then it
       pretty much follows the API described in the ZOOM-C documentation at
       http://www.indexdata.dk/yaz/doc/zoom.tkl

       The only additional (non-ZOOM-C) function provided by this module is
       event_str(), which takes as its argument an event code such as
       "Net::Z3950::ZOOM::EVENT_SEND_APDU", and returns a corresponding short
       string.

SEE ALSO
       The "ZOOM" module, included in the same distribution as this one.
