List::Rotation::Cycle(3)                   User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       List::Rotation::Cycle - Cycle through a list of values via a singleton
       object implemented as closure.

SYNOPSIS
           use List::Rotation::Cycle;

           my @array = qw( A B C );

           my $first_cycle  = List::Rotation::Cycle->new(@array);
           my $second_cycle = List::Rotation::Cycle->new(@array);

           print $first_cycle->next;  ## prints A
           print $second_cycle->next; ## prints B
           print $first_cycle->next;  ## prints C
           print $second_cycle->next; ## prints A, looping back to beginning

DESCRIPTION
       Use "List::Rotation::Cycle" to loop through a list of values.  Once you
       get to the end of the list, you go back to the beginning.

       "List::Rotation::Cycle" is implemented as a Singleton Pattern. You
       always just get 1 (the very same) Cycle object even if you use the new
       method several times.  This is done by using "Memoize" on the "new"
       method. It returns the same object for every use of "new" that comes
       with the same List of parameters.

OBJECT METHODS
       new Create a Cycle object for the list of values in the list.

       next
           Return the next element.  This method is implemented as a closure.
