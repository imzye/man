PTHREAD_RWLOCKATTR_SETPSHARED(3)              FreeBSD Library Functions Manual

NAME
     pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared – set the process shared attribute

LIBRARY
     POSIX Threads Library (libpthread, -lpthread)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <pthread.h>

     int
     pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared(pthread_rwlockattr_t *attr, int pshared);

DESCRIPTION
     The pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared() function sets the process shared
     attribute of attr to the value referenced by pshared.  The pshared
     argument may be one of two values:

     PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED   Any thread of any process that has access to the
                              memory where the read/write lock resides can
                              manipulate the lock.

     PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE  Only threads created within the same process as
                              the thread that initialized the read/write lock
                              can manipulate the lock.  This is the default
                              value.

RETURN VALUES
     If successful, the pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared() function will return
     zero.  Otherwise an error number will be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     The pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared() function will fail if:

     [EINVAL]           The value specified by attr or pshared is invalid.

STANDARDS
     The pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared() function is expected to conform to
     Version 2 of the Single UNIX Specification (“SUSv2”).

     The pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared() function first appeared in
     FreeBSD 3.0.  Support for process-shared read/write locks appeared in
     FreeBSD 11.0.
