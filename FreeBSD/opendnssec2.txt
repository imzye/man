NAME
       ods-hsmspeed - OpenDNSSEC HSM speed tester

SYNOPSIS
       ods-hsmspeed [-c config] -r repository [-i iterations] [-s keysize] [-t
       threads]

DESCRIPTION
       The ods-hsmspeed utility is part of OpenDNSSEC and can be used to test
       the performance of the configured HSMs.

       The components of OpenDNSSEC do not talk directly to the HSMs, but uses
       an internal library called libhsm. It then talks to the HSMs using
       PKCS#11.  The libhsm simplifies the process of creating keys and
       signatures for the other components of OpenDNSSEC.

       ods-hsmspeed will measure the speed by using the libhsm. The result
       that you get is somewhat lower than what the manufactures promises,
       because the libhsm creates some overhead to the pure PKCS#11
       environment.

OPTIONS
       -c config
              Path to an OpenDNSSEC configuration file.

              (defaults to /usr/local/etc/opendnssec/conf.xml)

       -i iterations
              Specify the number of iterations for signing an RRset.  A higher
              number of iterations will increase the performance.

              (defaults to 1 iteration)

       -r repository
              The speed test will be performed on this repository.

       -s keysize
              A temporary RSA key with the given keysize will be used for
              signing.

              (defaults to 1024 bit)

       -t threads
              The number of threads to use.  Most HSMs will be utilized better
              with multiple threads.

              (defaults to 1 thread)
