NAME
       Lingua::ZH::WordSegmenter - Simplified Chinese Word Segmentation

VERSION
       Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
           use Lingua::ZH::WordSegmenter;

           my $segmenter = Lingua::ZH::WordSegmenter->new();
           print encode('gbk', $segmenter->seg($_) );

Description
       This is a perl version of simplified Chinese word segmentation.

       The algorithm for this segmenter is to search the longest word at each
       point from both left and right directions, and choose the one with
       higher frequency product.

       The original program is from the CPAN module Lingua::ZH::WordSegment
       (http://search.cpan.org/~chenyr/) I did the follwing changes: 1) make
       the interface object oriented; 2) make the internal string into utf8;
       3) using sogou's dictionary (http://www.sogou.com/labs/dl/w.html) as
       the default dictionary.

METHODS
       $segmenter = Lingua::ZH::WordSegmenter->new(%opinions)
           This method constructs a new "Lingua::ZH::WordSegmenter" object and
           returns it.  Key/value pair arguments may be provided to set up the
           initial state.  The following options correspond to attribute
           methods described below:

       $segmenter->seg($input,[$encoding])
           Segment a input string, you can specify the encoding by the
