DWARF_DIENAME(3)       FreeBSD Library Functions Manual       DWARF_DIENAME(3)

NAME
     dwarf_diename – retrieve the name associated with a debugging information
     entry

LIBRARY
     DWARF Access Library (libdwarf, -ldwarf)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <libdwarf.h>

     int
     dwarf_diename(Dwarf_Die die, char **ret_name, Dwarf_Error *err);

DESCRIPTION
     Function dwarf_diename() retrieves a pointer to the NUL-terminated string
     associated with the DW_AT_name attribute of the debugging information
     entry descriptor referenced by argument die.  If the pointer was
     successfully retrieved, it is stored in the location pointed to by
     argument ret_name.

RETURN VALUES
     Function dwarf_diename() returns DW_DLV_OK on success.

     If the debugging information entry descriptor denoted by argument die
     does not contain a DW_AT_name attribute, the function returns
     DW_DLV_NO_ENTRY and sets argument err.  For other errors, it returns
     DW_DLV_ERROR and sets argument err.

ERRORS
     Function dwarf_diename() can fail with the following errors:

     [DW_DLE_ARGUMENT]       Either of arguments die or ret_name was NULL.

     [DW_DLE_NO_ENTRY]       Argument die had no DW_AT_name attribute.
