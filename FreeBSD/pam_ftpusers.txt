PAM_FTPUSERS(8)         FreeBSD System Manager's Manual        PAM_FTPUSERS(8)

NAME
     pam_ftpusers – ftpusers PAM module

SYNOPSIS
     [service-name] module-type control-flag pam_ftpusers [options]

DESCRIPTION
     The ftpusers service module for PAM, pam_ftpusers provides functionality
     for only one PAM category: account management.  In terms of the
     module-type parameter, this is the “account” feature.

   Ftpusers Account Management Module
     The ftpusers account management component (pam_sm_acct_mgmt()), succeeds
     if and only if the user is listed in /etc/ftpusers.

     The following options may be passed to the authentication module:

     debug         syslog(3) debugging information at LOG_DEBUG level.

     no_warn       suppress warning messages to the user.  These messages
                   include reasons why the user's authentication attempt was
                   declined.

     disallow      reverse the semantics; pam_ftpusers will succeed if and
                   only if the user is not listed in /etc/ftpusers.
