NAME
       Net::Frame - the base framework for frame crafting

SYNOPSIS
          # Basic example, send a TCP SYN to a target, using all modules
          # the framework comprises. It also waits for the response, and
          # prints it.

          my $target = '192.168.0.1';
          my $port   = 22;

          use Net::Frame::Device;
          use Net::Write::Layer3;
          use Net::Frame::Simple;
          use Net::Frame::Dump::Online;

          use Net::Frame::Layer::IPv4;
          use Net::Frame::Layer::TCP;

          my $oDevice = Net::Frame::Device->new(target => $target);

          my $ip4 = Net::Frame::Layer::IPv4->new(
             src => $oDevice->ip,
             dst => $target,
          );
          my $tcp = Net::Frame::Layer::TCP->new(
             dst     => $port,
             options => "\x02\x04\x54\x0b",
             payload => 'test',
          );
          my $oWrite = Net::Write::Layer3->new(dst => $target);

          my $oDump = Net::Frame::Dump::Online->new(dev => $oDevice->dev);
          $oDump->start;

          my $oSimple = Net::Frame::Simple->new(
             layers => [ $ip4, $tcp ],
          );
          $oWrite->open;
          $oSimple->send($oWrite);
          $oWrite->close;

          until ($oDump->timeout) {
             if (my $recv = $oSimple->recv($oDump)) {
                print "RECV:\n".$recv->print."\n";
                last;
             }
          }

          $oDump->stop;

DESCRIPTION
       Net::Frame is a fork of Net::Packet. The goal here was to greatly
       simplify the use of the frame crafting framework. Net::Packet does many
       things undercover, and it was difficult to document all the thingies.

       Also, Net::Packet may suffer from unease of use, because frames were
       assembled using layers stored in L2, L3, L4 and L7 attributes.
       Net::Frame removes all this, and is split into different modules, for
       those who only want to use part of the framework, and not whole
       framework.

       Finally, anyone can create a layer, and put it on his CPAN space,
       because of the modularity Net::Frame offers. For an example, see
       Net::Frame::Layer::ICMPv4 on my CPAN space.

       Net::Frame does ship with basic layers, to start playing.
