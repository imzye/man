NAME
       fsp - an all-in-one FSP client

SYNOPSIS
       fsp [-dvV] [[macro [parameters]] | [host [port [directory]]]]

DESCRIPTION
       fsp is an ftp like client for an anonymous-ftp style archive system
       called FSP.  See fspd(1) for further details on FSP.  When given the -d
       flag, the client enters debugging mode; this is generally not a good
       idea, and only exists for development purposes.  The -v and -V flags
       print out a copyright banner; they differ in that -V causes the program
       to immediately exit rather than continuing into interactive mode.

       When started fsp attempts to read a startup file (see FILES below).  If
       the input is a terminal, it then enters interactive mode, and awaits
       user commands.  If no host has been specified on the command line, then
       one must be specified before any remote commands can be executed.  If
       the input is not a tty, then commands are read until end-of-file is
       reached.  If an unquoted `|' is the first character in a command line
       argument then the rest of the line is considered to be a shell command,
       and the output of the command preceeding the `|' is sent to that
       command.  The available remote commands are:

       cat [-r] file [files...]
                 Same as get but the files are written to the screen rather
                 than to files.  If the -r flag is specified, then directories
                 that are found are entered and searched recursively for files
                 to view.  See the environment variable PAGER and the command
                 pager for how to make this command automatically pass output
                 into another program (for example, more ).

       close     Closes session to remote system.

       cd [directory]
                 Change directory on the remote system.  The permissions on
                 the remote directory are printed if the command was
                 successful.

       du [-rcas] [files...]
                 Calculate the disk usage of the files specified; if no files
                 given, default to the current directory (`.').  If the -r
                 flag is given, descend into subdirectories.  If -c is given,
                 give a grand total of filesizes at the end (assuming there is
                 more than one file given on the command line).  If -a is
                 given, show all files rather than just directory totals.  If
                 -s is given, then summarise the totals for each of the
                 arguments given on the command line rather than showing
                 subdirectories individually.  -s and -a are incompatible.

       get [-r] file [files...]
                 Download a copy of the list of files specified; globbing is
                 performed on the filenames given in the style of the Bourne
                 shell.  If the -r flag is given, then the remote directory
                 structure is copied locally; directories are entered, and
                 files within them copied.  Without the -r flag all files are
                 copied into to the local directory, and directories in the
                 arguments are ignored.

       grab file [files...]
                 An atomic action which performs a get followed by a delete.
                 Two attempts to grab the same file will result in only one of
                 them actually suceeding.  There is no -r version.

       ls [flags] [files]
                 Get a directory listing of remote files.  This behaves
                 practically identically to BSD4.2 ls; see the manual page for
                 ls(1) for options if you are using a BSD system, or guess if
                 you aren't.  The fsp ls command behaves differently to
                 standard FTP ls.  Notably, once it has fetched a directory
                 listing it does not query the remote server for that listing
                 again:  the listing is held on the local end.  This has 2
                 effects; the second directory listing you request is
                 (practically) instantaneous since it is not necessary to ask
                 for it again; and, secondly, if there are any modifications
                 to the remote directory whilst you are connected, you will
                 not see them.  Use the rehash command if you want to scratch
                 the clients copy of the remote systems directory listings and
                 protections.

       dir       Remote directory listing in long format. Dir is built-in
                 alias for ls -l.

       mkdir directory [directories...]
                 Make the specified directories on the remote system.  The
                 site that created the directories is labelled their owner.

       mv oldfile newfile
                 Renames specified file on the remote system. You must have
                 permission rename in target and source directory.

       pro [[-|+][permission]] [files...]
                 Return or set the protection for the remote directory.  If
                 the server is an advanced server then this command also gives
                 the local client knowledge about what operations can and
                 can't be done in the remote directory; these will be rejected
                 by the client rather than the server in order to save
                 bandwidth.  No facilities that the server allows will be
                 restricted; only commands which are guaranteed to fail will
                 be prevented.  permission can be either `c' or `d' in the
                 standard server; these refer to `create' and `delete'
                 permissions.  Prefixing by `+' sets the permission, `-'
                 removes it.  Only the owner of a directory can set the
                 permissions.  If no permissions are given, the current
                 settings are printed.

       put file [files...]
                 Upload a copy of the list of files specified; as for get,
                 globbing is performed on the filenames.  In order to upload a
                 file, you must have `create' permission on the remote
                 directory.

       rm file [files...]
                 Remove the specified files.  Globbing is performed as for
                 get.  In order for this command to succeed you must have
                 `delete' permission on the remote directory.

       rmdir directory [directories...]
                 Remove the specified directories on the remote system.  Only
                 the owner can do this, and the remote directories must be
                 empty for it to work.

       tar [-r] tarfile file [files...]
                 Create a tarfile locally called tarfile which is made up of
                 the listed files.  If the -r flag is given, then behave in a
                 similar recursive manner to get.  The names of the files
                 within the archive are precisely those that would be created
                 if the command was get.

       touch file [files...]
                 If the specified files do not exist on the remote server,
                 then the files are created zero-length.  If they do exist,
                 then nothing is done.  This is a much better method than
                 using mkdir to send messages!

       ver       Return the version string of the remote system.  This
                 information is cached locally.  If the server is an advanced
                 server, then this command also gives the local client
                 knowledge about what can and cannot be done; for example, the
                 client will prevent attempts to upload to a read-only server
                 since attempts to perform that operation are guaranteed to be
                 rejected.

       In addition to these commands, there is a set of commands which are
       purely local in their action.  Note that some of the commands you would
       have expected to be remote are in fact local.  Primarily, open does not
       contact the remote site.  Contact is only ever made with the server
       when you want to ask it something.  Further, ls is remote for only as
       long as it needs to be; as soon as the directory information is
       transferred, further ls purely locally.

       buffer [size|?]
                 Set the size of the data packets to be transferred.  This can
                 be at most 1024 bytes, but some systems may need the number
                 to be lowered in order to get the packets through gateways.

       builtin command [args]
                 Guarantee that the builtin version of command is executed.
                 This can be abbreviated to @.  i.e., @ls is identical to
                 builtin ls and both run the `proper' version of ls.

       burst [count|?]
                 When a request is made from the server for another piece of
                 information, either the request or reply can get lost.  In
                 this case, the client needs to try again; and again, and
                 again...  The current method of doing this is to try once,
                 wait a bit, try again, wait for a bit longer, etc, with the
                 retry period increasing at each failure.  The burst command
                 sets the number of `quick' retries that are made at each of
                 these increasing time steps; the long retry period can
                 stretch to about 10 minutes -- this command allows the number
                 of attempts made after each 10 minute period to be set.  (The
                 default is 1; you don't gain much by setting it at more than
                 about 4.)

       datestamp [on|off|?]
                 When a file is downloaded, this controls whether the access
                 dates on the file are set to the same as those on the remote
                 end.  This may or may not be useful...

       debug [level]
                 Set the debug level to the value specified, or print the
                 current level if no argument is given.  Most people won't
                 want to see the output that this generates... (specifying
                 `debug n' is the same as giving `n' -d flags on the command
                 line).

       delay [period|?]
                 Set the minimum retry period (in milliseconds); the default
                 is 1340, the minimum allowed is 1000.  This value is used as
                 a baseline and each retry has progressively longer gaps.
                 Note that this value is modified by performance of the
                 connection -- if the connection generally allows faster
                 communication, the retry period will be automatically changed
                 to take account of it.

       echo [text]

       echon [text]
                 Echo the supplied text to the user; these commands differ in
                 whether they also print a newline character at the end of the
                 text; echon does not.  These commands are only of any real
                 use in files that are to be sourced, or in macros.

       iferror command
                 If the last command caused an error, execute command.

       ifok command
                 If the last command completed successfully, execute command.

       onerror command
                 Whenever an error occurs, execute command.

       skipto label
                 Ignore all input lines until a line which begins with label:
                 Execute the command on that line (possibly a null command).
                 This is useful in scripts for ignoring a block of commands
                 depending on the error code of a command.

       exit [n]  This command terminates the client with the error code of the
                 previous command.  If the optional argument is supplied, then
                 the program exits with that value as the return code.

       flush     Stronger version of rehash All cached information about
                 remote system are cleared.

       help [ all | name ... ]
                 With no parameters, this prints out a list of the commands
                 and macros that are defined.  With the argument all a long
                 description of each command is given, as well as a long
                 description of each macro for which a help string was
                 provided.  Otherwise, the argument list is assumed to be a
                 list of commands, and the long help string for each command
                 is printed.  ?  is an alias for this command.

       host      Same as open.

       lcd directory
                 Change directory on the local machine.

       macro [-[rl]] name [help]
                 Without either the -r or -l flags, this defines a macro
                 called name and, if the help string is supplied (which must
                 be a quoted single argument to the command), then this will
                 be printed when help is invoked on the macro name.  If a
                 macro is defined, then it will be executed whenever its name
                 is typed as a command.  Macros take precedence over builtin
                 commands; this means that you can alias commands out of
                 existence.  If you want to guarantee that you execute the
                 builtin version of a command precede it by the command
                 builtin.  Enter the macro line-by-line, and terminate it with
                 a single `.' on a line of its own (no leading whitespace).
                 Macros can not (currently) be either self-recursive or
                 mutually recursive; if a recursion loop is detected then the
                 attempt to recurse is ignored and the macro continues
                 regardless.

                 If the -r flag is given then the specified macro is removed.
                 If -l is given, then the macro is listed.

       maxdelay [period|?]
                 Set the maximum retry period (in milliseconds); the default
                 is 60000, the minimum allowed is 1000, but setting this
                 bellow  3000 is useless most time.

       open name [port [directory]]
                 Set the host of the remote system; also, possibly set the
                 port number and directory.  Note that if either the port or
                 the directory are omitted, they default to the values 21 and
                 / respectively.

       pager [command]
                 Set the `pager' to the command specified.  The pager is
                 invoked by the cat command, which filters its output though
                 it.  The value will tend to be something like more or less.
                 Supplying no parameter turns off the pager.  The initial
                 pager command is given by the environment variable PAGER.
                 When the pager command is invoked, the environment variable
                 FSPFILE is set to the name of the file that is being cat

       port number
                 Set the port number of the connection.

       prompt [on|off|?]
                 When a download operation is performed, a check is made to
                 see if the file that you are trying to download already
                 exists; if it does, you are prompted for whether you want to
                 continue the download, or whether you want to restart it.
                 This turns on/off those questions.  If it is set to `off'
                 then the a continue operation is always performed.

       pwd       Print the current host, port, and directory on the remote
                 system.  The client holds all this information.

       quit      Finish your interaction with fsp.  The program exits with a
                 return value of 0.  This is the same as exit 0 .

       readme [never|once|always]
                 Determine how often (if ever) README files should be read.
                 The options are (hopefully) self explanatory.  A README can
                 be force-read for the current directory by typing the command
                 without any arguments.

       rehash    Drop all information about the remote site.  The local copies
                 of the remote directory structure, permissions and server
                 flags will be lost.

       shell command [args]
                 Run a `shell' command on the specified command and arguments.
                 In fact, this is currently a lie.  The command is executed by
                 a direct fork; in a future version this will be implemented
                 properly.  shell can be replaced by `!' (no space needed
                 after the `!').

       since [time|local-file]
                 When a `ls' is performed the date stamps on files are
                 compared against the time specified to determine whether they
                 are printed.  The interface to this command leaves a lot to
                 be desired; the time must be specified as the number of
                 seconds since 1st January 1970, or it can be specified as the
                 date stamp on a local file.  (Only the latter form is really
                 any use.)

       source file [files...]
                 Treat the contents of the specified as if they were typed at
                 the keyboard.

       timeout n If a single communication attempt (i.e., one packet of any
                 transfer) takes longer than n seconds, then cause the command
                 to return an error.  If n is set to 0, then assume an
                 infinite timeout period.  This is useful when combined with
                 the iferror command -- it allows a script to terminate a
                 session if the remote server is not detected.

       touch file [files...]
                 Create the specified files in the remote directory.  If the
                 file already exists, nothing is done, otherwise a zero length
                 file is `uploaded'.  You must have `create' permission in the
                 remote directory.

       trace [off|on|all|hash|?]
                 Sets the type of tracing used on file transfers.  `off'
                 ensures that FSP keeps quiet during file transfers; no
                 information is printed about the transaction.  `on' causes
                 the number of Kbytes transferred to be printed, as well as
                 retry information (the character `R', which turns into a
                 spinning bar for each retry of a get/put of a Kbyte of data).
                 `hash' behaves rather more like ftp; each Kbyte transferred
                 causes a hash to be printed, and information about file size
                 and speed are printed.  `all' causes statistics about the
                 packet transfers to be printed after each file copy
                 operation.  If `?' is given, the current mode is printed.  If
                 no parameter is supplied then the current value is advanced
                 (with wrap-around) through the list given above.

FILES
       ~/.fsprc  If this file exists it is used as a start-up script.  It is
                 useful for executing personalisation commands and macro
                 definitions.

ENVIRONMENT
       FSPRC  If this variable is set, then it overrides the default file from
              which start-up instructions are read.

       PAGER  Determine the initial setting of the pager used by the cat
              command.

       FSPFILE
              This environment variable is set by the cat command to allow the
              pager command to know the name of the file it is being fed.

AUTHORS
       The original (individual) clients were written by Wen-King Su <wen-
       king@vlsi.cs.caltech.edu>.  They, and some library code, was then
       modified, and the front-end parser, macro's, local commands and general
       glue were written by Phil Richards <pgr@prg.oxford.ac.uk> in order to
       form this client.  The initial globbing code was written by Rene
       Seindal for an ftpd, and modified minutely to fit with the scheme of
       things by Phil Richards. After 10 years or so, this code is now
       maintained by Radim Kolar.

BUGS
       Quite a lot, thank you very much.  As they are found, they are listed
       and slowly fixed.  Pipes inside macros can cause unexpected behaviour
       if the macro is then fed into another pipe (unexpected = I don't know
       what will happen).  Other major ones that have to fixed at the moment
       are: brace expansion needs adding to the globbing code; positional
       parameters, environment variables, and local variables should be added
       (this would allow a number of parameter setting commands to be removed,
       or turned into macro's); the shell command should be one -- there
       should also be a non-shell command for fast exec'ing of commands.

       All bug reports on this code should be directed to
       http://fspclient.sourceforge.net
