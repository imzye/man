       -m, --minimal-length size in bytes
              minimum size of file to process.

       -o, --optimize-memory
              reduce memory usage, but increase process time. (This option is

       -x, --excessive-size size in bytes
              files that exceed this limit won't be read using mmap.

       Try for more info.

EXAMPLES
       The following command line will report duplicate pictures, using
       libpuzzle (-I) whose sizes are greater than 8192 bytes ( -m 8192 )
       found recursively (-r) starting in your home directory.

       $ ftwin -m 8192 -v -r -I ${HOME}


       This line will report duplicate files (no more in "image mode", but
       according to their content) whose extension is .txt and that are not in
       a .svn directory:

       $ ftwin -e ".*/\.svn/.*" -w ".*\.txt$" -v -r ${HOME}
