NAME
     sandboxfs – A virtual file system for sandboxing

SYNOPSIS
     sandboxfs [--allow who] [--cpu_profile path] [--input path] [--help]
               [--mapping type:mapping:target] [--node_cache] [--output path]
               [--reconfig_threads count] [--ttl duration] [--version]
               [--xattrs] mount_point

DESCRIPTION
     sandboxfs is a FUSE file system that exposes a combination of multiple
     files and directories from the host's file system in the form of a
     virtual tree with an arbitrary layout.  You can think of a sandbox as an
     arbitrary view into the host's file system with different access
     privileges per directory.

     sandboxfs is designed to allow running commands with limited access to
     the file system by using the virtual tree as their new root, and to do so
     consistently across a variety of platforms.

     The sandbox instance mounted at mount_point is initially configured with
     the mapping specifications provided via repeated instances of --mapping.
     Once running, the mount point can be reconfigured any number of times:
     sandboxfs listens for reconfiguration requests on the file specified by
     --input and reconfigures the mappings as requested, emiting a response on
     the file specified by --output.

     The following flags are recognized:

     --allow who
           Specifies who should have access to the file system.  who must be
           one of: ‘other’ to indicate that everyone, including root, can
           access the file system; ‘root’ to indicate that only the current
           user and root can access the file system; and ‘self’ to indicate
           that only the current user can access the file system.

           The default value is ‘self’ because the standard FUSE configuration
           does not allow more relaxed permissions, and it would be a pity if
           you couldn't run sandboxfs successfully without additional
           configuration.  To change this behavior, add ‘user_allow_other’ to
           /etc/fuse.conf on Linux or set the
           ‘vfs.generic.osxfuse.tunables.allow_other’ sysctl(8) tunable to 1
           on macOS.

           Note that, at least on macOS, you will need to consider granting
           ‘other’ permissions if you intend to run signed binaries through
           the sandbox.  This is because the amfid(8) daemon, which implements
           the signature validation, runs as a different user and must be able
           to access the executables.

     --cpu_profile path
           Enables CPU profiling and stores the pprof log to the given path.
           This feature is only available if sandboxfs was built with
           gperftools support (i.e. with the compile-time ‘profiler’ feature).
           Passing this flag when support is not enabled results in an error.

     --input path
           Points to the file from which to read new configuration requests,
           or ‘-’ (the default) for stdin.  See the Reconfigurations
           subsection for details on the contents and behavior of the input
           file.

     --help
           Prints global help details and exits.  Specifying this flag causes
           all other valid flags and arguments to be ignored.

     --mapping type:mapping:target
           Registers a new mapping.  This flag can be given an arbitrary
           number of times as long as the same mapping is not repeated.  See
           the Mapping specifications subsection for details on how a mapping
           is specified.

     --node_cache
           Enables the path-based node cache, which causes nodes to be reused
           across reconfigurations when they map to the same underlying paths.
           This should offer a performance boost when the same set of files
           are mapped over and over again across different reconfiguration
           operations.

           This cache used to be enabled by default but it turned out to be
           problematic.  For example, on macOS, OSXFUSE seems to keep track of
           the path where a node first appeared, which causes trouble if the
           node disappears and then reappears in a different location (for
           example, dladdr(3) returns invalid paths).  For this reason, the
           cache is now disabled by default but is still kept around in the
           code for experimentation.  The cache may be removed in a future
           release altogether if these problems cannot be worked around.

     --output path
           Points to the file to which to write confirmations of
           reconfiguration, or ‘-’ (the default) for stdout.  See the
           Reconfigurations subsection for details on the contents and
           behavior of the output file.

     --ttl duration
           Specifies how long the kernel is allowed to cache file metadata
           for.  The duration is currently specified as a number of seconds
           followed by the ‘s’ suffix.

     --reconfig_threads count
           Sets the number of threads to use to process reconfiguration
           requests.  Defaults to the number of logical CPUs in the system.

     --version
           Prints version information and exits.  Specifying this flag causes
           all other valid flags and arguments to be ignored except for
           --help, which has priority over this one.

           The first line printed to stdout is machine parseable and follows
           the following structure:

                 sandboxfs MAJOR.MINOR[.ADDITIONAL OPTIONAL QUALIFIERS]

           Programs automating invocations of sandboxfs can use this
           information to determine the correct command-line syntax to use.

     --xattrs
           Enables support for extended attributes, which causes all extended
           attribute operations to propagate to the underlying files.

           When disabled (the default), the behavior of extended attribute
           operations is platform-dependent: they may either fail as not
           supported or they may act as no-op stubs.  The reason is that this
           feature is disabled by telling the kernel that none of these
           operations are implemented in sandboxfs, which then causes the
           kernel to never contact the daemon for them.  Keeping extended
           attributes disabled can result in a performance boost.

   Mapping specifications
     The basic concept behind a sandboxfs instance is the mapping
     specification.  A mapping specification defines how an arbitrary location
     within the sandbox relates to another arbitrary location on the host file
     system.  Mapping specifications have three components: the target, which
     is a path to a file or directory into the host file system (i.e. outside
     of the mount point); the mapping, which is an absolute path within the
     mount point in which the target is exposed; and the type, which specifies
     the permissions of the mapping.

     The target must exist but the mapping may not: in particular, any path
     subcomponents of the mapping that have not been previously mapped within
     the sandbox will be created as virtual read-only nodes.  This means that
     the ordering of the mappings matters.

     For example: consider a sandboxfs instance mounted onto /mnt that maps
     /my/custom/bin to the /usr/bin target.  With this setup,
     /mnt/my/custom/bin will expose the contents of the real /usr/bin
     directory.

     The following types are currently supported:

     ro    A read-only mapping.  The contents of the target are exposed
           verbatim at the mapping point and they cannot be modified through
           the mount point.  Any write access will result in an EPERM.

     rw    A read/write mapping.  The contents of the target are exposed
           verbatim at the mapping point and they can be modified at will
           through the mount point.  Writes through the moint point are
           applied immediately to the underlying target directory.

   Reconfigurations
     While a mount point is live, sandboxfs listens for reconfiguration
     requests on the file specified by --input and writes reconfiguration
     responses to the file specified by --output.  These two files essentially
     implement a rudimentary RPC system subject to change.

     The mount point can be configured any number of times while mounted,
     which allows for processes to efficiently change the view of the sandbox
     at will without having to remount it.  Closing the input file causes
     sandboxfs to freeze its configuration and not accept any more requests
     for reconfiguration, but the file system will continue to operate
     normally until it is either unmounted or signaled.

     Reconfiguration requests can be issued at any time.  However, it is
     impossible for sandboxfs to properly deal with ongoing file system
     operations or with open file handles in a deterministic manner.  Due to
     this, the behavior of ongoing file system activity while a
     reconfiguration happens is unspecified but can be assumed to be stable
     (i.e.  sandboxfs will not deadlock nor crash).  As a result, it is highly
     recommended that you only send reconfiguration requests when you know
     that the file system is quiescent.

     Configuration requests are provided as a stream of JSON objects.  Each
     request is an object with just one of the following keys:
     ‘CreateSandbox’, which requests the creation of a new top-level directory
     with a given set of mappings; and ‘DestroySandbox’, which requests the
     deletion of the mappings at an existing top-level directory.

     A ‘CreateSandbox’ operation contains an object with three keys: ‘id’
     specifies the name of the top-level directory to create, ‘mappings’
     contains an array of all mappings to apply within that directory, and
     ‘prefixes’ contains a dictionary of all new prefixes to register for
     prefix-encoded paths.  Each mapping entry is an object with the following
     keys: ‘path’ and ‘underlying_path’, which define the mapping paths;
     ‘path_prefix’ and ‘underlying_path_prefix’, which identify the prefixes
     for the provided paths, respectively; and ‘writable’, which if set to
     true indicates a read/write mapping.  The mapping must not yet exist in
     the file system.  Each entry in the prefixes dictionary is keyed by the
     numerical identifier of the prefix (supplied as a string due to JSON
     limitations), and the value is the absolute path for that prefix.

     Prefix-encoded paths serve to minimize the size of the requests but their
     use is optional.  To specify a path in its prefix-encoded form, ‘path’
     and/or ‘underlying_path’ must be relative and ‘path_prefix’ and/or
     ‘underlying_path_prefix’ must indicate a positive non-zero integer.  The
     referenced prefix must be registered in the same request or a previous
     request, but if the prefix is repeated across requests, it must point to
     the same location.  To avoid prefix-encoded form, paths must be given as
     absolute and they need to reference the special prefix 0.

     A ‘DestroySandbox’ operation simply contains the ‘id’ of a previously-
     created sandbox as a string.  The whole tree hierarchy is unmapped.

     Each configuration request is paired with a response, which are also
     provided as a stream of JSON objects.  Each response is a map with an
     optional field, which corresponds to the identifier given in the request,
     and an optional ‘error’ field, which is empty if the request was
     successful and contains an error message otherwise.  Responses with a
     missing identifier indicate fatal failures during the reconfiguration
     (e.g. due to a syntax error) and are not recoverable.

     To minimize the size of the requests, all fields support aliases and
     default values as follows:

           ‘CreateSandbox’           Alias: ‘C’.
           ‘DestroySandbox’          Alias: ‘D’.
           ‘id’                      Alias: ‘i’.
           ‘mappings’                Alias: ‘m’.  Default value: empty array.
           ‘prefixes’                Alias: ‘q’.  Default value: empty object.
           ‘path’                    Alias: ‘p’.
           ‘path_prefix’             Alias: ‘x’.  Default value: ‘0’.
           ‘underlying_path’         Alias: ‘u’.
           ‘underlying_path_prefix’  Alias: ‘y’.  Default value: ‘0’.
           ‘writable’                Alias: ‘w’.  Default value: ‘false’.

EXIT STATUS
     sandboxfs exits with 0 if the file system was both mounted and unmounted
     cleanly; 1 on a controlled error condition encountered during the
     execution of a command; or 2 on a usage error.

     Sending a termination signal to sandboxfs will cause the file system to
     exit in a controlled manner, ensuring that the mount point is released.
     If the file system is busy, the signal will be queued until all open file
     descriptors on the file system are released at which point the file
     system will try to exit cleanly again.  Note that, due to limitations in
     signal handling in Rust (which is the language in which sandboxfs is
     implemented), the reception of a signal will cause sandboxfs to return 1
     instead of terminating with a signal condition.

ENVIRONMENT
     sandboxfs recognizes the following environment variables:

     RUST_LOG
           Sets the maximum level of logging messages sent to stderr.
           Possible values include ‘error’, ‘warn’, ‘info’ and ‘debug’, though
           many more syntaxes are supported.  See the documentation for Rust's
           ‘env_logger’ crate for more details.

     sandboxfs may recognize other standard Rust variables like RUST_BACKTRACE
     but the list above attempts to describe the ones a user may find most
     useful.

EXAMPLES
   Command-line invocation
     This example configures a sandbox that maps the whole host's file system
     but clears /tmp to point into a sandbox-specific writable directory:

           sandboxfs --mapping=ro:/:/ --mapping=rw:/tmp:/tmp/fresh-tmp /mnt

   Reconfiguration request
     This example creates a new sandbox under /first with a single mapping
     that will appear as /first/tmp and that is mapped to /tmp/abc; then
     deletes said sandbox, and then creates a different sandbox under /second
     with a single mapping that will appear as /foo/bar and that is mapped to
     /tmp/x/y:

           [
               {"CreateSandbox": {
                   "id": "first",
                   "mappings": [
                       {"path": "/tmp", "underlying_path": "/tmp/abc", "writable": true}
                   ]
               }},
               {"DestroySandbox": "first"}
               {"CreateSandbox": {
                   "id": "second",
                   "mappings": [
                       {"path": "/foo/bar", "underlying_path": "/tmp/x/y",
                        "writable": false}
                   ]
               }}
           ]

     When sending this request, we obtain the following response:

           {"id": "first", "error": null}
           {"id": "first", "error": null}
           {"id": "second", "error": null}

   Prefix-encoded reconfiguration request
     This example is the same as above, but this time using prefix-encoded
     paths:

           [
               {"CreateSandbox": {
                   "id": "first",
                   "mappings": [
                       {"path": "", "path_prefix": 1,
                        "underlying_path": "abc", "underlying_path_prefix": 1,
                        "writable": true}
                   ],
                   "prefixes": {
                       "1": "/tmp"
                   }
               }},
               {"DestroySandbox": "first"}
               {"CreateSandbox": {
                   "id": "second",
                   "mappings": [
                       {"path": "bar", "path_prefix": 2,
                        "underlying_path": "x/y", "underlying_path_prefix": 1,
                        "writable": false}
                   ],
                   "prefixes": {
                       "2": "/foo"
                   }
               }}
           ]

   Minimized reconfiguraton request
     This example is the same as above, but this time using field aliases and
     default values to minimize the message:

           [
               {"C": {
                   "i": "first",
                   "m": [
                       {"p": "", "x": 1, "u": "abc", "y": 1, "w": true}
                   ],
                   "q": {
                       "1": "/tmp"
                   }
               }},
               {"D": "first"}
               {"C": {
                   "i": "second",
                   "m": [
                       {"p": "bar", "x": 2, "u": "x/y", "y": 1}
                   ],
                   "q": {
                       "2": "/foo"
                   }
               }}
           ]

AUTHORS
     The sandboxfs was originally developed as a Go program by Pallav Agarwal
     ⟨pallavag@google.com⟩ with guidance from Julio Merino ⟨jmmv@google.com⟩.
     The program was later reimplemented in Rust by the latter.

BUGS
     The following are known limitations of sandboxfs:

     •   Hard links are not supported.

     •   Mapping the same external file or directory under two different
         locations within the mount point results in undefined behavior.
         Writes may not be reflected at both mapped locations at the same
         time, which can lead to data corruption.  This is true even for read-
         only mappings because each separate view within the mount point may
         have cached different contents, returning different data than what's
         truly on disk.  Using --node_cache may help mitigate this issue but
         it doesn't always do.

     •   The --allow root setting does not work on Linux; use --allow other as
         the alternative.  See https://github.com/bazil/fuse/issues/144 for
         details.

     •   It is currently impossible to terminate sandboxfs cleanly while the
         file system is busy.  Signals received while the file system is in
         use will be queued as described in EXIT STATUS and fatal signals will
         cause sandboxfs to leak the mount point (possibly irrecoverably
         without a reboot because of kernel bugs).

     •   Any explicitly-mapped directories and any scaffold directories (those
         directories that appear to represent intermediate path components
         that do not exist anywhere else in the file system) cannot be
         removed.  Attempts to remove them will result in a “permission
         denied” error.  While it could be possible to implement some
         different behavior, this is what sandboxfs currently exposes.  You
         may or may not consider this to be a bug.

     •   If --node_cache is enabled, node data is cached in-memory for all
         files accessed through a sandboxfs instance in order to offer good
         performance across reconfigurations.  However, this cache does not
         currently implement any expiration policy, which means that memory
         usage can grow unboundedly if many different files are mapped and
         accessed through the sandbox.

     •   If a FIFO is used for -input, sandboxfs will block until a separate
         process opens the FIFO for writing.  This happens even before the
         file system starts serving, which means the file system is not usable
         until the FIFO is opened.

     •   While it is possible to reconfigure the entries of the root directory
         of a running file system, it is not possible to reconfigure the root
         mapping itself to point to a different location or to change its
         writability properties.

     •   Unmapping entries doesn't fully work.  The FUSE library that
         sandboxfs currently uses does not support sending cache invalidation
         requests to the kernel, which means unmapped entries will not vanish
         immediately from the file system.  You may be able to mitigate this
         by setting a low node TTL with the --ttl flag, but this doesn't work
         on macOS either because OSXFUSE does not honor node TTLs.

     •   Handling of extended attributes on open-but-deleted-files does not
         work properly.  Those files will appear as if they didn't have any
         extended attributes any longer, and attempts to modify them will
         fail.
