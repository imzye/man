NAME
       syncterm - BBS terminal program

SYNOPSIS
       syncterm [-46chqrts] [-blist] [-edelay] [-iinterface] [-llines]
       [-nconfig] [URL]

       syncterm -T

       syncterm -v

DESCRIPTION
       SyncTERM is a terminal program designed specifically for connecting to
       a Bulletin Board System (BBS)

   Options
       -4     Only resolve IPv4 addresses

       -6     Only resolve IPv6 addresses

       -blist Specify an alternative BBS list path

       -c     Hide the status line

       -edelay
              Specify the "escape delay" in milliseconds for curses(3) mode.
              Since curses uses the escape key for its own purposes, using the
              escape key for other control requires a timeout.  If this
              timeout is too low, extended keystrokes such as arrow keys will
              be interpreted as an escape keypress followed by other
              characters.  If this delay is too high, there will be a large
              delay after a single escape is pressed.  If an escape delay of
              less than 10ms is specified, it is forced to 25ms.

       -h     Specifies the default scheme for URL to be ssh://

       -iinterface
              Specify the interface to use.  Depending on compile options and
              library availability, not all interfaces will be available for
              all installations.  If -i is not specified, SyncTERM will choose
              the "best" mode in the following order: X11, GDI, SDL, Win32
              Console, curses, ANSI.  The SDL mode specifically can fail in
              ways that the automatic fallback can not properly detect (most
              notably with libGGI when it is enabled in SDL.)  When this
              occurs, a specific mode will need to be forced.

              When -i is specified, only the specified mode will be attempted.
              No automatic fallback will be performed.

              For the items with [F|W], an F or W may be added to indicate
              Fullscreen or Windowed mode respectively

              The possible values for iface are:

              A      ANSI mode.  This mode as well as the curses modes have
                     Special caveats (see TEXT MODE CAVEATS)

              C      Ccurses mode.  Special caveats listed in TEXT MODE
                     CAVEATS

              F      Curses mode and assume that the display in use will
                     display Codepage 437 glyphs for characters above 127.
                     Special caveats listed in TEXT MODE CAVEATS

              G[F|W] Windows GDI output mode.  Uses the Win32 API directly.

              I      Curses mode, and force ASCII only.  Special caveats
                     listed in TEXT MODE CAVEATS

              S[F|W] Require SyncTERM to run in SDL mode.  This requires SDL
                     support to have been compiled in, and the library
                     ``libSDL.so'' to be in the library search path.

              W      Run in Windows Console mode.

              X      Require SyncTERM to run in X11 mode. This requires X11
                     support to have been compiled in, and the library
                     ``libX11.so'' to be in the library search path.

       -llines
              Sets the number of screen lines to lines.  Only specific values
              are allowed for lines and they are: 14, 21, 25, 28, 43, 50, and
              60.  If any other value is chosen, a value of 50 is used.

       -nconfig
              Specify an alternative INI file

       -q     Quiet mode.  Hides various popups during a connect.

       -r     Specifies the default scheme for URL to be rlogin://

       -s     Run in "safe mode" which disables the modification of local
              files such as the

       -t     Specifies the default scheme for URL to be telnet://

       -T     When this is the ONLY argument, dumps terminfo entry to stdout
              and exits.

       -v     When this is the ONLY argument, dumps version info to stdout and
              exits.

RUN-TIME LINKING
       For some features, such as SDL support, and X11 support, run-time
       linking is employed using dlopen().  Using this, it is possible to
       build a version which will use SDL, and X11 if they are present, but
       not fail to run if they are not.

TEXT MODE CAVAETS
       When running in one of the text modes such as curses or ANSI, many of
       the control functions are modified since there is no reliable way to
       use extra modifier keys. As a result, CTRL-S and CTRL-Q can not be sent
       to the remote system. Since these are the flow control characters, this
       should not present major usability issues.

       The escape character (ASCII 27) is used in curses and ANSI modes to
       begin a control sequence. As such, there is a delay to detect if the
       next character continues the escape sequence or is a base escape.
       Because of this, there will be a perceptible delay when the escape key
       is used. This delay can be adjusted using the -e parameter, but
       selecting the "correct" value is a dark art since any value is provably
       incorrect.

       The curses and ANSI modes are not necessarily the correct number of
       lines for a traditional screen mode. As such, filler will be added
       around the terminal screen. For some display sizes, unpredictable
       results may occur.

FILES
       /wrkdirs/usr/ports/comms/syncterm/work/stage/usr/local/etc/syncterm.lst
              The system wide dialing directory.

       syncterm.lst
              The users dialing directory.  The location of this file varies
              by OS and can be viewed in SyncTERM in the "File Locations"
              option of the "SyncTERM Settings" menu.

       syncterm.ini
              The users SyncTERM configuration file.  The location of this
              file varies by OS and can be viewed in SyncTERM in the "File
              Locations" option of the "SyncTERM Settings" menu.
