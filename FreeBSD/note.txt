NAME
       NOTEDB::binary - module lib for accessing a notedb from perl

SYNOPSIS
               # include the module
               use NOTEDB;

               # create a new NOTEDB object
               $db = new NOTEDB("binary", "/home/tom/.notedb", 4096, 24);

               # decide to use encryption
               # $key is the cipher to use for encryption
               # $method must be either Crypt::IDEA or Crypt::DES
               # you need Crypt::CBC, Crypt::IDEA and Crypt::DES to have installed.
               $db->use_crypt($key,$method);

               # do not use encryption
               # this is the default
               $db->no_crypt;

               # get a single note
               ($note, $date) = $db->get_single(1);

               # search for a certain note
               %matching_notes = $db->get_search("somewhat");
               # format of returned hash:
               #$matching_notes{$numberofnote}->{'note' => 'something', 'date' => '23.12.2000 10:33:02'}

               # get all existing notes
               %all_notes = $db->get_all();
               # format of returnes hash like the one from get_search above

               # get the next noteid available
               $next_num = $db->get_nextnum();

               # modify a certain note
               $db->set_edit(1, "any text", "23.12.2000 10:33:02");

               # create a new note
               $db->set_new(5, "any new text", "23.12.2000 10:33:02");

               # delete a certain note
               $db->set_del(5);

               # turn on encryption. CryptMethod must be IDEA, DES or BLOWFISH
               $db->use_crypt("passphrase", "CryptMethod");

               # turn off encryption. This is the default.
               $db->no_crypt();

DESCRIPTION
       You can use this module for accessing a note database. There are
       currently two versions of this module, one version for a SQL database
       and one for a binary file (note's own database-format).  However, both
       versions provides identical interfaces, which means, you do not need to
       change your code, if you want to switch to another database format.

       Currently, NOTEDB module is only used by note itself. But feel free to
       use it within your own project! Perhaps someone want to implement a
       webinterface to note...

USAGE
       please see the section SYNOPSIS, it says it all.
