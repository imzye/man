NAME
       Benchmark::Forking - Run benchmarks in separate processes

SYNOPSIS
         use Benchmark::Forking qw( timethis timethese cmpthese );

         timethis ($count, "code");

         timethese($count, {
             'Name1' => sub { ...code1... },
             'Name2' => sub { ...code2... },
         });

         cmpthese($count, {
             'Name1' => sub { ...code1... },
             'Name2' => sub { ...code2... },
         });

         Benchmark::Forking->enabled(0);  # Stop using forking feature
         ...
         Benchmark::Forking->enabled(1);  # Begin using forking again

DESCRIPTION
       The Benchmark::Forking module changes the behavior of the standard
       Benchmark module, running each piece of code to be timed in a separate
       forked process. Because each child exits after running its timing loop,
       the computations it performs can't propogate back to affect subsequent
       test cases.

       This can make benchmark comparisons more accurate, because the separate
       test cases are mostly isolated from side-effects caused by the others.
       Benchmark scripts typically don't depend on those side-effects, so in
       most cases you can simply use or require this module at the top of your
       existing code without having to change anything else. (A few key
       exceptions are noted in "BUGS".)

   Background
       The standard Benchmark module can sometimes report inaccurate or
       misleading results, in part because it doesn't isolate its test cases
       from one another. This means that the order that cases are run in can
       influence the results, because side effects, either obvious or obscure,
       can accumulate and affect later tests.

       Data in global variables is an obvious source of side effects; in the
       below example, the grep takes longer as more items are pushed onto the
       array, so the test functions that run later will be reported by
       Benchmark as being slower, despite their code being identical:

         cmpthese( 1000, {
           "test_1" => sub { push @global, scalar grep 1, @global },
           "test_2" => sub { push @global, scalar grep 1, @global },
           "test_3" => sub { push @global, scalar grep 1, @global },
         } );

       More cryptic sources of side effects can include cache priming,
       idiosyncrasies of the underlying Perl implementation, or the state of
       the operating system and environment. For example, if the code to be
       benchmarked require a lot of in-process RAM, earlier tests may be
       slowed down by having to allocate the memory the first time, or later
       tests may be slowed down by having to pick through the heap looking for
       free space.  These effects are difficult to predict and can be
       laborious to identify and compensate for.

       This module provides a solution to most aspects of this problem.  Once
       you use Benchmark::Forking, the example benchmark above will report the
       correct conclusion that the three identical tests run at approximately
       the same speed.

   Implementation
       Benchmark::Forking replaces the private runloop() function in the
       Benchmark module with a wrapper that forks before calling the original
       function. Forking is accomplished by the special "open(F,"-|")" call
       described in "open" in perlfunc, and the results are passed back as
       text from the child to the parent through an interprocess filehandle.

       When comparing several test cases with the "timethese" or "cmpthese"
       functions, the main process will fork off a child and wait for it to
       complete its timing of all of the repetitions of one piece of code,
       then fork off a new child to handle the next case and wait again.

INTERFACE
       You can use this module in the same way you would use the standard
       Benchmark module.

   Exports
       This module re-exports the same functions provided by Benchmark:
       countit, timeit, timethis, timethese, and cmpthese.

       For a description of these functions, see Benchmark.

   Methods
       The benchmark forking functionality is automatically enabled once you
       load this module, but you can also disable and re-enable it at run-time
       using the following class methods.

       enabled   If called without arguments, reports the current status:

                     my $boolean = Benchmark::Forking->enabled;

                 If passed an additional argument, enables or disable forking:

                     Benchmark::Forking->enabled( 1 );
                     $t = timeit(10, '$Global = 5 * $Global');
                     Benchmark::Forking->enabled( 0 );

       enable    Enables benchmark forking.

                     Benchmark::Forking->enable();

       disable   Disables benchmark forking.

                     Benchmark::Forking->disable();

BUGS
       Because this depends on Perl's implementation of fork, it will not work
       as expected on platforms which lack this feature, notably Microsoft
       Windows.

       Some external resources may not work when opened in the parent process
       and then accessed from multiple forked instances. If using this module
       causes your file, network, or database code to fail with an unusual
       error, this issue may be the culprit.

       Some Benchmark scripts either accidentally or deliberately rely on the
       side-effects that this module avoids. If using this module causes your
       Perl code to behave differently than expected, you may be relying on
       this behavior; you can either revise your code to remove the dependency
       or continue to use the non-forking Benchmark.

       If the standard Benchmark module were more fully object-oriented, this
       functionality could be added via subclassing, rather than by fiddling
       with Benchmark's internals, but the current implemenation doesn't seem
       to allow for this.
