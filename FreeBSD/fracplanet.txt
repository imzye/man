NAME
       fracplanet - Create and view random fractal terrain and planets.


SYNOPSIS
       fracplanet [ <QtOptions> ] [ --help ] [ --verbose ] [ --display-list ]
       [ --invert-mouse-y ] [ --wireframe ]


DESCRIPTION
       Fracplanet generates random planets and terrain with oceans, mountains,
       icecaps and rivers.  Parameters are specified interactively and the
       results displayed using OpenGL.  The generated objects can be exported
       for Pov-Ray or Blender.

       A document fully describing usage via the application's GUI is
       accessible from the application's "About" menu once it is running.


GENERAL OPTIONS
       <QtOptions> Standard options recognised by the Qt toolkit (for example
       -geometry <width>x<height> Note that these use the single-dash option
       style.  ).

       --help, -h Display a list of recognised arguments.

       --verbose, -v Display information about fracplanet and the GL graphics
       system it's running on.


RENDERING OPTIONS
       These affect the initial settings on the render controls tab, which
       controls the OpenGL display.

       --display-list, -d Start up the application with rendering in display
       list mode by default (c.f immediate mode).  This is particularly useful
       when the application is running remotely as the generated meshes are
       then only sent to the local OpenGL display hardware once.

       --invert-mouse-y, -y Start application with mouse in non-joystick mode
       for flight.

       --wireframe, -w Start application with rendering set to wireframe mode.
