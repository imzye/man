NAME
     ural – Ralink Technology RT2500USB IEEE 802.11 driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device ehci
           device uhci
           device ohci
           device usb
           device ural
           device wlan
           device wlan_amrr

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_ural_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The ural driver supports USB 2.0 wireless adapters based on the RT2500USB
     chipset.

     The RT2500USB chipset consists of two integrated chips, a RT2570 MAC/BBP
     and a radio transceiver (the model of which depends on the card
     revision).

     The RT2522, RT2523, RT2524, RT2525, RT2525e and RT2526 radio transceivers
     operate in the 2.4GHz band (802.11b/g) whereas the RT5222 is a dual-band
     radio transceiver that can operate in the 2.4GHz and 5.2GHz bands
     (802.11a).

     ural supports station, adhoc, hostap, and monitor mode operation.  Only
     one virtual interface may be configured at any time.  For more
     information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

EXAMPLES
     Join an existing BSS network (i.e., connect to an access point):

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev ural0 inet 192.168.0.20 \
               netmask 0xffffff00

     Join a specific BSS network with network name “my_net”:

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev ural0 ssid my_net up

     Join a specific BSS network with 64-bit WEP encryption:

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev ural0 ssid my_net \
                   wepmode on wepkey 0x1234567890 weptxkey 1 up

     Join a specific BSS network with 128-bit WEP encryption:

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev ural0 wlanmode adhoc ssid my_net \
               wepmode on wepkey 0x01020304050607080910111213 weptxkey 1

DIAGNOSTICS
     ural%d: device timeout  The driver will reset the hardware.  This should
     not happen.

HISTORY
     The ural driver first appeared in OpenBSD 3.7.

AUTHORS
     The original ural driver was written by Damien Bergamini
     <damien.bergamini@free.fr>.

BUGS
     Host AP mode doesn't support client power save.  Clients using power save
     mode will experience packet loss (disabling power saving on the client
     will fix this).
