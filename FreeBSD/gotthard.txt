GOTTHARD(8)             FreeBSD System Manager's Manual            GOTTHARD(8)

NAME
     gotthard – ssh through https proxy tunnel

SYNOPSIS
     gotthard [-hv] [-c configfile]

DESCRIPTION
     gotthard is a daemon which tunnels ssh(1) sessions through an https
     proxy.

     The options are as follows:

     -h      Prints short listing of gotthard options.

     -v      Shows version.

     -c configfile
             Choose an alternate configuration file.  The default
             configuration file is /etc/gotthard.conf.

     In the configuration file you define on which address gotthard shall
     listen for client connections, the address the https proxy listens on,
     and which external address to connect to after passing through the https
     proxy.  The external host is the one running sshd(8).  After gotthard has
     been started you can establish connections like in this example:

           ssh -p 2222 hacki@localhost

     If the https proxy needs user authentication, you can do so by using the
     auth option in the configuration file.  This string must be in the format
     <username>:<password>.

EXAMPLES
     The following is an example configuration file:

           auth user:password
           listen 127.0.0.1:2222
           proxy 10.0.0.1:3128
           external 192.168.0.1:22

FILES
     /etc/gotthard.conf            default configuration file
     ~HOME/.gotthard/gotthard.log  log file
     ~HOME/.gotthard/gotthard.pid  pid file

HISTORY
     First version of gotthard was written in 2001.
