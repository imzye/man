NAME
       fwbuilder - Multiplatform firewall configuration tool

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/bin/fwbuilder [-ffile.fwb] [-d] [-h] [-ofile] [-Pobject_name] [-r]
       [-v]



DESCRIPTION
       fwbuilder is the Graphic User Interface (GUI) component of Firewall
       Builder.

       Firewall Builder consists of a GUI and set of policy compilers for
       various firewall platforms. It helps users maintain a database of
       objects and allows policy editing using simple drag-and-drop
       operations. GUI generates firewall description in the form of XML file,
       which compilers then interpret and generate platform-specific code.
       Several algorithms are provided for automated network objects discovery
       and bulk import of data. The GUI and policy compilers are completely
       independent, this provides for a consistent abstract model and the same
       GUI for different firewall platforms.

       Firewall Builder supports firewalls based on iptables (Linux kernel
       2.4.x and 2.6.x, see fwb_ipt(1)), ipfilter (variety of platforms
       including *BSD, Solaris and others, see fwb_ipf(1)), pf (OpenBSD and
       FreeBSD, see fwb_pf(1)), ipfw (FreeBSD and others), Cisco PIX (v6.x and
       7.x) and Cisco IOS extended access lists.



OPTIONS
       -f FILE
              Specify the name of the file to be loaded when program starts.


       -r     When this command line option is given in combination with -f
              file, the program automatically opens RCS head revision of the
              file if file is in RCS. If file is not in RCS, this option does
              nothing and the file is opened as usual.


       -d     Turns on debug mode. Note that in this mode the program
              generates lots of output on standard error. This is used for
              debugging.


       -h     Prints brief help message


       -o file
              Specify the name of the file for the print output, see option
              "-P".


       -P object_name
              Print rules and objects for the firewall object "object_name"
              and immediately exit. The program does not go into interactive
              mode. Print output will be placed in the file specified with
              "-o" option.  If file name is not given with option "-o", print
              output is stored in the file "print.pdf" in the current
              directory.
