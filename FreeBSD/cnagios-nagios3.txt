NAME
       cnagios - colorized console display for viewing Nagios status
       information

SYNOPSIS
       cnagios [-bdhV] [-A age] [-a age] [-g /perl_regex/] [-i interval] [-l
       u|d|o|w|c] [-m h|s] [-P rows] [-p rows] [-s n|a] [-v /perl_regex/]

DESCRIPTION
       cnagios is a full-screen terminal interface for viewing Nagios HOST and
       SERVICE objects, and the durations of their current states.

       It's quite fast, much faster than the Nagios web interface, because
       it's written in C using the curses library.  And it's very flexible,
       because it uses hooks directly into the Perl C library to shorten host,
       service and plugin output, and also filter the displayed HOSTs or
       SERVICEs.

       The following summarizes the options:
       -A <age>         filter UP/OKAY objects by age less than <age>
       -a <age>         filter objects by age less than <age>
       -b               display in black and white
       -d               print debug info to stderr
       -g /perl_regex/  filter host/service/plugin-output with /perl_regex/
       -h               print (this) usage info
       -i <integer>     set polling interval to <integer> seconds (default is 90)
       -l <u|d|o|w|c>   display objects with UP/DOWN/OK/WARNING/CRITICAL status
       -m <h|s>         display HOST objects or SERVICE objects
       -P <integer>     set header padding to <integer> (default is 2)
       -p <integer>     set row/column padding to <integer> (default is 1)
       -s <n|a>         sort objects by-name or by-age
       -V               print version and exit
       -v /perl_regex/  negative filter host/service/plugin-output with /perl_regex/
       fi

FILES
       <inst_dir>/etc/cnagios.pl  Perl hooks for shortening/altering output
       <inst_dir>/etc/cnagiosrc   System-wide startup file
       $HOME/.cnagiosrc           User defined startup file

ENVIRONMENT
       TERM and TERMINFO will be used to control the display, as per
       ncurses(3.)

TRIVIA
       cnagios has a very venerable history.  It's a clone of the "Internet
       Rover" display that was used to monitor NSFNET (the progenitor to the
       Internet) as early as 1987.
