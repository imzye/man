       This should probably be better done with Moose and roles. It would
       however require a major overhaul to everything inside Net::DRI, so this
       would probably not happen very soon, maybe with a Perl6 port.

       This class was introduced very late in Net::DRI, multiple parts of this
       framework should be modified to take advantage of this class.
