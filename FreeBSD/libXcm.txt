Detailed Description
Macro Definition Documentation
   #define XCM_COLOR_DESKTOP   '_ICC_COLOR_DESKTOP'
       The XCM_COLOR_DESKTOP macro The atom is attached on the root window to
       tell about a color servers activity. The content is of type XA_STRING
       and has four sections separated by a empty space char ' '. The
       _ICC_COLOR_DESKTOP atom is a string with following usages:

       • uniquely identify the colour server

       • tell the name of the colour server

       • tell the colour server is alive All sections are separated by one
         space char ' ' for easy parsing.

       The first section contains the process id (pid_t) of the color server
       process, which has set the atom. The second section contains time since
       epoch GMT as returned by time(NULL). The thired section contains the
       bar '|' separated and surrounded capabilities:

       • ICP _ICC_COLOR_PROFILES - support per region profiles

       • ICM _ICC_COLOR_MANAGEMENT - color server is active

       • ICO _ICC_COLOR_OUTPUTS - support per window and output configuration

       • ICR _ICC_COLOR_REGIONS - support regions

       • ICA _ICC_COLOR_DISPLAY_ADVANCED - use CMS advanced settings, e.g.
         proofing

       • V0.3 indicates version compliance to the _ICC_Profile in X spec The
         fourth section contains the servers name identifier.

       As of this specification the third section must contain ICR and the
       supported _ICC_PROFILE in X version.

       A example of a valid atom might look like: _ICC_COLOR_DESKTOP(STRING) =
       '4518 1274001512 |ICR|ICM|V0.3| compiz_colour_desktop'

       Referenced by XcmColorServerCapabilities(), XcmeContext_Setup(), and
       XcmeContext_Setup2().

   #define XCM_COLOR_OUTPUTS   '_ICC_COLOR_OUTPUTS'
       The XCM_COLOR_OUTPUTS macro is attached to windows and specifies on
       which output the window should look correctly. The type is XA_STRING.

       Referenced by XcmeContext_Setup(), and XcmeContext_Setup2().

   #define XCM_COLOR_PROFILES   '_ICC_COLOR_PROFILES'
       The XCM_COLOR_PROFILES macro represents a atom name for under which
       XcolorProfile data can be stored.

       Referenced by XcmeContext_Setup(), XcmeContext_Setup2(),
       XcolorProfileDelete(), and XcolorProfileUpload().

   #define XCM_COLOR_REGIONS   '_ICC_COLOR_REGIONS'
       The XCM_COLOR_REGIONS macro represents a atom name for under which
       XcolorRegions data can be stored.

       Referenced by XcmeContext_Setup(), XcmeContext_Setup2(),
       XcmePrintWindowRegions(), xcmePrintWindowRegions(),
       XcolorRegionDelete(), XcolorRegionFetch(), and XcolorRegionInsert().

   #define XCM_DEVICE_PROFILE   '_ICC_DEVICE_PROFILE'
       The _ICC_DEVICE_PROFILE atom The atom will hold a native ICC profile
       with the exposed device characteristics at the compositing window
       manager level. The colour server shall if no _ICC_DEVICE_PROFILE(_xxx)
       is set, copy the _ICC_PROFILE(_xxx) profiles to each equivalent
       _ICC_DEVICE_PROFILE(_xxx) atom. The _ICC_PROFILE(_xxx) profiles shall
       be replaced by a sRGB ICC profile. The counting in the atoms (_xxx)
       name section follows the rules outlined in the ICC Profile in X
       recommendation. After finishing the session the the old state has to be
       recovered by copying any _ICC_DEVICE_PROFILE(_xxx) atoms content into
       the appropriate _ICC_PROFILE(_xxx) atoms and removing all
       _ICC_DEVICE_PROFILE(_xxx) atoms. The colour server must be aware about
       change property events indicating that a _ICC_PROFILE(_xxx) atom has
       changed by a external application and needs to move that profile to the
       appropriate _ICC_DEVICE_PROFILE(_xxx) atom and set the
       _ICC_PROFILE(_xxx) atom to sRGB as well. The modification of the
       _ICC_DEVICE_PROFILE(_xxx) atoms by external applications is undefined.

Enumeration Type Documentation
   anonymous enum
       The XCM_COLOR_SERVER_ enums describe colour server capabilities as
       specified in XCM_COLOR_DESKTOP atom.

Function Documentation
   int XcmColorServerCapabilities (Display *dpy)
       informs which colour server services are available Function
       XcmColorServerCapabilities Query the capabilities of a colour server.
       In case no colour server is running, the function should return zero.
       The return value consists of a bit mask of XCM_COLOR_SERVER_ properties
       from the XCM_COLOR_DESKTOP atom.

       XCM_COLOR_SERVER_MANAGEMENT, XCM_COLOR_SERVER_PROFILES, and
       XCM_COLOR_SERVER_REGIONS.

   int XcolorProfileDelete (Display *dpy, XcolorProfile *profile)
       Decreases the ref-count of the profile. Function XcolorProfileDelete
       You shouldn't use the profile anymore after this call because it could
       have been removed from the internal database in the compositing
       manager. If you do, nothing bad will happen, just that color management
       won't work on regions that use this profile.

       References XcolorProfile::length, and XCM_COLOR_PROFILES.

   int XcolorProfileUpload (Display *dpy, XcolorProfile *profile)
       Uploads the profile into all screens of the display. Function
       XcolorProfileUpload Uploads the profile into all screens of the
       display. Profiles are ref-counted inside the compositing manager, so
       make sure to call XcolorProfileDelete() before your application exits
       or when you don't need the profile anymore.

       References XcolorProfile::length, and XCM_COLOR_PROFILES.

   int XcolorRegionActivate (Display *dpy, Windowwin, unsigned longstart,
       unsigned longcount)
       Activates regions. Function XcolorRegionActivate Activates 'count'
       regions starting at positiong 'start' in the stack. Unlike the other
       functions it does not check whether 'start + count' extends beyond the
       stack end. To disable all regions pass zero to 'count'.

   int XcolorRegionDelete (Display *dpy, Windowwin, unsigned longstart,
       unsigned longcount)
       Deletes regions. Function XcolorRegionDelete Deletes 'count' regions
       starting at 'start' in the stack. If 'start + count' in beyond the
       stack end, nothing will be done and the function returns '-1'.

       References XCM_COLOR_REGIONS, and XcolorRegionFetch().

   XcolorRegion* XcolorRegionFetch (Display *dpy, Windowwin, unsigned long
       *nRegions)
       Fetches the existing regions. Function XcolorRegionFetch Fetches the
       existing regions and returns an array of 'XcolorRegion'. After you're
       done, free the array using XFree(). The number of regions is put into
       'nRegions'.

   int XcolorRegionInsert (Display *dpy, Windowwin, unsigned longpos,
       XcolorRegion *region, unsigned longnRegions)
       Inserts the supplied regions into the stack. Function
       XcolorRegionInsert Inserts the supplied regions into the stack at the
       position 'pos', shifting the existing profiles upwards in the stack. If
       'pos' is beyond the stack end, nothing will be done and the function
       returns '-1'.
