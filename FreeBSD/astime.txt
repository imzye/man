DESCRIPTION
       The astime is a X11 application that acts as an analogue clock that we
       all are familiar with.  It shows the current time on the dial. The day
       of the week is in the upper left corner and the current date is at the
       bottom. The AM/PM indicator is in the top right corner.


CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
       -h or -H
              Prints a short description and usage message.

       -V
              Version control. Prints out the version of the program.

       -rc <file name>
              Read the configuration from the given resource file.  The
              default resource file read if none are given on the command line
              is ~/.astimerc. The settings on the command line overwrite any
              settings read from the resource file.  A single '#' character
              can be used to "comment out" any line in the .astimerc file,
              which is useful for making temporary changes.

       -geometry [WxH][+|-]x[+|-]y
              Displays the window at the specified location on the screen and
              resizes the window to the specified size WxH. This works as
              standard X Windows geometry option. (See XParseGeometry (3x)).

       -iconic
              Starts the astime application in the iconized mode.  The icon
              has the same appearance with the main window.  When this option
              is given, the -position refers to the position of the icon
              window as well as the main window.

       -withdrawn
              Starts the astime application in the withdrawn mode.  This
              option is necessary to be able to dock the astime in the
              WindowMaker dock.  When this option is given, the -position
              refers to the position of the icon window as well as the main
              window.  astime ignores the -iconic option when started in
              withdrawn mode.

       -standout
              This changes the appearance of the astime display from "pushed-
              in" to "popped-out". The first is the default look.  The
              "popped-out" applets look much better in WindowMaker's dock
              according to some opinions. Give it a try in any case.

       -noborder
              The clock looses its border effectively becoming a 2D clock
              instead of having a raised or lowered faceplate.  This option is
              reportedly recommended for FVWM use.  When this option is used
              "-standout" is ignored.

       -u <update rate>
              Changes the polling rate for updating the clock.  The update
              rate is specified in seconds. The value of 1 is the minimum.
              Default value is 1 second.  Updating at a different value is
              hardly a good idea when you have the seconds hand on. Switch it
              off with the "-nosec" option.

       -exe <program name>
              Specifies which program should be executed when you click on the
              clock's face. If this switch is not specified, astime does not
              intercept the mouse clicks at all. So, by default, nothing is
              run. This option uses system(3) call to execute the specified
              program. The maximum length of the command is restricted to 255
              characters (for no particular reason).

              The icon does not usually respond to mouse clicks (you would
              want to be able to de-iconify the window, right?) unless you are
              running in the "withdrawn" mode (-withdrawn option).  Then the
              icon responds the same way the clock face does.

       -shift <hours>
              Shifts the clock by the specified number of hours. This is a
              simple way of putting a clock in a different timezone.  Useful
              when you want several clocks showing the current time in
              different places. The value can be both positive and negative.
              The values above 23 and below -23 are silently ignored.

              Note that the date and day of the week are not adjusted.

       -ns
              Do not draw the seconds hand of the clock. Only the minutes and
              hours hands are drawn.

       -nd
              Do not show the current date.

       -nap
              Do not show the AM/PM indicator.

       -display <name>
              The name of the display to start the window in.  It works just
              as X Windows display option.

       -title <name>
              Set the window title and the icon title to the specified name.

       -bg <color>
              Changes the color of the background of the dial.  Default colour
              is #385971.

       -fg <color>
              Changes the color of the foreground of the dial.  Default colour
              is #ffffff.

       -sec <color>
              Changes the color of the second hand of the clock.  Default
              colour is #efc669.

       -min <color>
              Changes the color of the minute hand of the clock.  Default
              colour is #ff3030.

       -hour <color>
              Changes the color of the hour hand of the clock.  Default colour
              is #ef3838.

       -day <color>
              Changes the color of the day-of-the-week display.  Default
              colour is #a0a0a0.

       -date <color>
              Changes the color of the date display.  Default colour is
              #a0a0a0.

       -ampm <color>
              Changes the color of the AM/PM display.  Default colour is
              #a0a0a0.

       -nt
              Don't draw the second ticks on the clock face.

       -at
              Draw all ticks, not only every 5 seconds.

       -fs
              "Floating" second indicator in the style of xclock.

       -ts
              Use a thin second hand - default in the regular mode.  Use it to
              change the appearance of the second hand while in the -fh mode.
              It looks very good with the normal hands of large thickness too.

       -fh
              Fancy hands mode. Renders fancy xclock-style hands.

       -nh
              "Neon" hands. Try this with the fancy hands mode.

       -ht <number>
              Hand thickness. Can be a number from 0 to 200.

       -ot <number>
              Hand outline thickness. Can be a number from 0 to 200.

       -nf
              No foreground. Equal to "-nd -nap -nt".

       -label <text>
              Asks the astime to label the clock's face with the specified
              text. Useful when you want to distinguish between different
              instances of astime running on your desktop.

       -fn <font name>
              Use the specified font for the label. The default font is
              "-*-helvetica-medium-r-*-*-9-240-*-*-*-*-*-*". Don't ask me why,
              I do not know, I just found it fits my desktop well. If you have
              a better idea - send me a mail. The font is loaded only if you
              specify a label and has otherwise no effect.

       -lcol <label color>
              Draw the label using the specified color. The default color is
              #a0a0a0. Has no effect if you did not specify a label.

       -ltop
              Draw the label on the top of the clock's face instead of drawing
              it at the bottom by default. Does not do anything if a label was
              not specified.

RESOURCE FILE SYNTAX
       astime can read and parse a configuration file.  This configuration
       file describes the desired look of the applet (there are equialents to
       all command-line options) and specifies actions to be taken on
       particular events.  The configuration file is usually ~/.astimerc but
       astime can be forced to read any file using the -rc option.  Any
       options read from the configuration file may be overridden with the
       command-line options (if a corresponding command-line option exists,
       naturally).

       The configuration file may contain only one option per line.  Empty
       lines and lines starting with # are ignored.

              be drawn. When zero is specified only the clock hands appear.

       floatSeconds <0 | 1>
              A boolean variable specifying if the second indicator should be
              a floating pointer (a bit like in xclock) rather than a hand.

       execProg <command line>
              Specifies a command to be executed when the clock face is
              clicked.  The command line must be enclosed in double quotes.

       withdrawn <0 | 1>
              A boolean variable (0 | 1). This option is necessary when
              running with WindowMaker. Produces a withdrawn window that can
              be docked.

       iconic <0 | 1>
              A boolean variable (0 | 1). Specifies if the applet should start
              as an icon rather than a full window.

       standout <0 | 1>
              A boolean variable (0 | 1). Changes the appearance of the
              display from "pushed-in" to the "standing out".

       noborder <0 | 1>
              A boolean variable (0 | 1). Changes the appearance of the
              display from 3D to plain 2D by removing the shaded border around
              the faceplate.

       shift <+-hours>
              Specifies that the clock should show the local time shifted by
              the given number of hours. Useful to see the time in different
              timezones.

       title <name>
              Specifies which title should be given to this clock.

       at hh:mm:ss <command line>
              Specifies program to be run at a particular time.  The command
              line must be enclosed in double quotes.

       Label <text>
              Asks the astime to label the clock's face with the specified
              text. Useful when you want to distinguish between different
              instances of astime running on your desktop.  Equivalent to the
              command-line '-label' option.

       Font <font name>
              Use the specified font for the label. The default font is
              "-*-helvetica-medium-r-*-*-9-240-*-*-*-*-*-*". Don't ask me why,
              I do not know, I just found it fits my desktop well. If you have
              a better idea - send me a mail. The font is loaded only if you
              specify a label and has otherwise no effect.  Equivalent to the
              command-line '-fn' option.

       LabelColor <color>
              Draw the label using the specified color. The default color is
              #a0a0a0. Has no effect if you did not specify a label.
              Equivalent to the command-line '-lcolor' option.

       LabelTop <0 | 1>
              If the value is 1 draws the label on the top of the clock's
              face; if the value is 0 - at the bottom (default). Does not do
              anything if a label was not specified.

INVOCATION
       astime can be called in different ways.  The most common invocation is
       the command line:

            user@host[1]% astime -bg blue -fg white &

       Another way to call astime is from the window manager:

            *Wharf "astime" nil Swallow "astime" astime -nosec &

       This line, when placed in the wharf file in the user's Afterstep
       configuration directory will cause astime to be a button on the Wharf
       (1) button bar under the afterstep (1) window manager.

       If you run WindowMaker then you should use the "-withdrawn" option:

            user@host[1]% astime -withdrawn -standout &

       and then drag the icon to the dock.

       If you run fvwm2 I think you will like to try this one:

            astime -geometry 120x120+890+0 -bg black
            -fg \#0000ff -sec \#efc669 -min \#20b2aa
            -hour \#8141d7 -day \#7766aa -ampm \#7766aa
            -date \#7766aa -at -fs -fh -nh

       Of course, it looks less scary if you put all those settings in the
       ~/.astimerc file. The example .astimerc file (sample.astimerc) included
       in the distribution provides the aforementioned settings.

BUGS
       My programs do not have bugs, they just develop random features ;-)

       Well, there are limitations. All the strings for the color names,
       display name, and the geometry have the length limit of 64 characters
       (terminating zero included).  The string copying routine cuts the names
       that are longer.
