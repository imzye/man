HEXAGONS(6)                  FreeBSD Games Manual                  HEXAGONS(6)

NAME
       xhexagons - Hexagons X widget

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/games/xhexagons [-geometry
       [{width}][x{height}][{+-}{xoff}[{+-}{yoff}]]] [-display
       [{host}]:[{vs}]] [-[no]mono] [-[no]{reverse|rv}] [-{foreground|fg}
       {color}] [-{background|bg} {color}] [-{border|bd} {color}] [-tile
       {color}] [-size {int}] [-[no]corners] [-base {int}] [-username
       {string}]

DESCRIPTION
       The puzzle was thought up by the author, though he believes he saw one
       in a toy museum in Germany or Austria.  Also Bernhard Wiezorke has the
       "Hexafax, the New Fifteen Puzzle" which is similar.

FEATURES
       If in corners mode: Press "mouse-left" button to move a tile, then
       release "mouse-left" button on a space.  It will not move if blocked.
       One can only move one tile at a time. The only tiles that can be moved
       are the tile(s) next to both spaces.
       If in nocorners mode: Click "mouse-left" button to move a tile.  One
       can move more than one tile at a time and one is not constrained by
       parity.

       Click "mouse-right" button, or press "R" or "r" keys, to randomize the
       puzzle.  One must double click on "mouse-right" if the puzzle is being
       worked on.

       Press "I" or "i" keys to increase the number of tiles.

       Press "D" or "d" keys to decrease the number of tiles.

       Press "C" or "c" keys to toggle corners mode.  (Default is on).

       "S" or "s" keys reserved for the auto-solver (unimplemented).

       Press "U" or "u" keys to undo move.

       Press "G" or "g" keys to get a saved puzzle.

       Press "W" or "w" keys to write or save a puzzle.

       Press "Q", "q", or "CTRL-C" keys to kill program.

       Use the key pad, "R" keys, or arrow keys to move without the mouse.
       Key pad is defined for Hexagons as:
       7   9   Upper Left, Upper Right

         ^

       4< >6   Left, Right

         v

       1   3   Lower Left, Lower Right

       The title is in the following format (non-motif version):
              xhexagons: <size> @ (<Number of moves>/{<Record number of moves>
              <username>|"NEVER noaccess"}) - <Comment>
       If there is no record of the current puzzle, it displays "NEVER
       noaccess".

OPTIONS
       -geometry {+|-}X{+|-}Y
               This option sets the initial position of the hexagons window
               (resource name "geometry").

       -display host:dpy
               This option specifies the X server to contact.

       -{foreground|fg} color
               This option specifies the foreground of the hexagons window
               (resource name "foreground").

       -{background|bg} color
               This option specifies the background of the hexagons window
               (resource name "background").

       -{border|bd} color
               This option specifies the border color of the tiles in the
               hexagons window (resource name "borderColor").

       -tile color
               This option specifies the tile color of the tiles in the
               hexagons window (resource name "tileColor").

       -size <int>
               This option allows you to change the number of hexagons in a
               row (resource name "sizeA").

       -corners
               This option specifies the mode where movement is very
               restrictive (resource name "corners").

       -nocorners
               This option specifies the mode where movement is very easy
               (resource name
                "corners").

       -base int
               This option specifies the base used (default is base 10)
               (resource name "base").

       -username string
               This option specifies the user name for any records made or
               else it will get your login name (resource name "userName").

SAVE FORMAT
       The format is not standard.  The reason for this is that this is simple
       and I do not know what the standard is.

              size: 1-12 <number of tiles in a row>
              corners: 0-1 <0 false, 1 true; if 0 then hexagon corners are all
              snipped>
              moves: 0-MAXINT <total number of moves>

              startingPosition: <array where 0 is the empty space for the HIGH
              hexagon and -1 is the empty space for the LOW hexagon>

       This is then followed by the moves, starting from 1.
              move #: <direction>
       Direction is represented as 0 upper right, 1 right, 2 lower right, 3
       lower left, 4 left, and 5 upper left.

       Caution: the program may crash on corrupted input.
