RRENUMD(8)              FreeBSD System Manager's Manual             RRENUMD(8)

NAME
     rrenumd – router renumbering daemon

SYNOPSIS
     rrenumd [-df] [-c conf_file | -s]

DESCRIPTION
     The rrenumd utility transmits router renumbering request packets, to
     renumber the routers in the site network.

     On KAME-based systems, router renumbering requests are received and
     processed by rtadvd(8).  For other systems, refer to relevant documents.

     The program will daemonize itself on invocation.  It reads configuration
     information from standard input if -s is specified, or from conf_file if
     -c conf_file is specified.

     The contents of configuration information are described in
     rrenumd.conf(5).

     After successful configuration, rrenumd sends router renumbering messages
     periodically to configured destinations.  Messages contain prefixes
     configured to be renumbered.

     -d      Debug mode.

     -f      Foreground mode.  Do not become daemon.

     -s      Script mode.  Configuration information is obtained from standard
             input.

     -c conf_file
             Specify a configuration file where configuration information is
             kept.

EXIT STATUS
     The program exits with 0 on success, and non-zero on failures.
