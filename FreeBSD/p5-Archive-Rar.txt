NAME
       Archive::Rar - Interface with the 'rar' command

SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
       •   Windows

       •   Linux

SYNOPSIS
        use Archive::Rar;
        my $rar = Archive::Rar->new();
        $rar->Add(
               -size => $size_of_parts,
               -archive => $archive_filename,
               -files => \@list_of_files,
        );

       To extract files from archive:

        use Archive::Rar;
        my $rar = Archive::Rar->new( -archive => $archive );
        $rar->List( );
        my $res = $rar->Extract( );
        print "Error $res in extracting from $archive\n" if ( $res );

       To list archived files:

        use Archive::Rar;
        my $rar = Archive::Rar->new( -archive => $archive );
        $rar->List( );
        $rar->PrintList( );

       Using further options:

        use Archive::Rar;
        my $rar = Archive::Rar->new( -archive => $archive );
        my $res = $rar->Extract(-donotoverwrite => 1, -quiet => 1 );
        print "Error $res in extracting from $archive\n" if ( $res );

DESCRIPTION
       This is a module for the handling of rar archives.

       Locates the rar command (from PATH or from regedit for Win32) and
       encapsulate it to create, extract and list rar archives.

       Note: There are a few things that have gone awry. Have a look at the
       Archive::Rar::Passthrough module that is part of this distribution. It
       is a lower-level interface to the "rar" command, but it does some
       things in a safer way than this module (namely shell escaping or lack
       thereof).

       At the moment these methods are implemented:

       new()
           Returns a new Rar object. You can pass defaults options.

       Add(%options)
           Add file to an archive.

       Extract(%options)
           Extract the contains of an archive.

       List(%options)
           Fill the 'list' variable of the object whith the index of an
           archive.  Returns 0 on success or a numerical error code.

       PrintList(%options)
           Prints the file contents list that was previously generated using
           List() to STDOUT.

       GetBareList(%options)
           Returns an array with the file contents list that was previously
           generated using List().  Adding the -excludepaths option and
           setting it to true, the pathnames will be excluded and a simple
           basename of the listed files will be returned.

OPTIONS
       "-archive"
           Archive filename.

       "-files"
           List of files to add. You can use a scalar value or an array
           reference.

       "-quiet"
           No output for the rar command if True.

       "-sfx"
           Create self-extracting archive.

       "-size"
           Size of the parts in bytes.

       "-verbose"
           Level of verbosity.

       "-excludepaths"
           Exclude paths from names.

       "-donotoverwrite"
           Do not overwrite existing files if True.

       "-lowprio"
           For Unix-like systems only, this options runs the extraction with
           low scheduling priority, if Ture.

KNOWN BUGS
       As of the current version, the system commands calling 'rar' are
       assembled as a string.  This means that some parameters which take a
       string may have problems with shell quoting.
