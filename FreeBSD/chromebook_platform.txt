CHROMEBOOK_PLATFORM(4)                        FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual

NAME
     chromebook_platform – support driver for hardware on various Chromebook
     models

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines into
     the kernel configuration file:

           device chromebook_platform

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           chromebook_platform_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The chromebook_platform driver provides automatic configuration for
     devices that cannot be enumerated or safely probed.  In particular, I2C
     peripherals are different from model to model.  chromebook_platform has a
     model-specific information about the I2C peripherals, their drivers,
     their bus attachments and slave addresses.

     Note that chromebook_platform does not load driver modules for the
     peripherals.  Those have to be compiled into the kernel or loaded
     separately.
