DESCRIPTION
       This package provides a Perl interface to the F5 BigIP iControl API.

       The F5 BigIP iControl API is an open SOAP/XML for communicating with
       supported F5 BigIP products.

       The primary aim of this package is to provide a simplified interface to
       an already simple and intutive API and to allow the user to do more
       with less code.  By reducing the API invocations to methods returning
       simple types, it is hoped that this module will provide a simple
       alternative for common tasks.

       The secondary aim for this package is to provide a simple interface for
       accessing statistical data from the iControl API for monitoring,
       recording, archival and display in other systems.  This objective has
       largely been obsoleted in v11 with the introduction of new statistical
       monitoring and display features in the web UI.

       This package generally provides two methods for each each task; a raw
       method typically returning the response as received from iControl, and
       a "stringified" method returning a parsed response.

       In general, the stringified methods will typically fufill most
       requirements and should usually be easier to use.

   METHODS
       new (%args)

               my $ic = BigIP::iControl->new(
                                       server          => 'bigip.company.com',
                                       username        => 'api_user',
                                       password        => 'my_password',
                                       port            => 443,
                                       proto           => 'https',
                                       verify_hostname => 0
                               );

       Constructor method.  Creates a new BigIP::iControl object representing
       a single interface into the iControl API of the target system.

       Required parameters are:

       server
          The target F5 BIGIP device.  The supplied value may be either an IP
          address, FQDN or resolvable hostname.

       username
          The username with which to connect to the iControl API.

       password
          The password with which to connect to the iControl API.

       port
          The port on which to connect to the iControl API.  If not specified
          this value will default to 443.

       proto
          The protocol with to use for communications with the iControl API
          (should be either http or https).  If not specified this value will
          default to https.

       verify_hostname
          If TRUE when used with a secure connection then the client will
          ensure that the target server has a valid certificate matching the
          expected hostname.

       suffixed to the filename if missing from the supplied filename.

       Specifying no optional filename parameter or using the filename today

       file in the format YYYYMMDD.

       save_base_configuration ()

               $ic->save_base_configuration();

       the list is returned as a hash with the name of the configuration
       archive as the key, and the creation date of the configuration archive
       as the value.

       The creation date uses the native date format of:

               Day Mon D HH:MM:SS YYYY

       Where Day is the three-letter common abbreviation of the day name, Mon
       is the three letter common abbreviation of the month name and D has the
       value range 1-31 with no leading zeros.

       a pre-parsed hash in an easy-to-digest format.

       get_interface_statistics_stringified ($interface)

               my $inet        = ($ic->get_interface_list())[0];
               my %stats       = $ic->get_interface_statistics_stringified($inet);

       Returns all statistics for the specified interface as a hash having the
       following structure;

               {
               timestamp       => 'YYYY-MM-DD-hh-mm-ss',
               stats           =>      {
                                       statistic_1     => value
                                       ...

                                               );

       Creates an event subscription with the target system.  This method
       requires the following parameters:

       name
          A user-friendly name for the subscription.

       url
          The target URL endpoint for the event notification interface to send
          event notifications.

       username
          The basic authentication username required to access the URL
          endpoint.

       password
          The basic authentication password required to access the URL
          endpoint.

       ttl
          The time to live (in seconds) for this subscription. After the ttl
          is reached, the subscription will be removed from the system. A
          value of -1 indicates an infinite life time.

       min_events_per_timeslice
          The minimum number of events needed to trigger a notification. If
          this value is 50, then this means that when 50 events are queued up
          they will be sent to the notification endpoint no matter what the
          max_timeslice is set to.

       max_timeslice
          This maximum time to wait (in seconds) before event notifications
          are sent to the notification endpoint. If this value is 30, then
          after 30 seconds a notification will be sent with the events in the
          subscription queue.

NOTES
       Statistic Methods

       Within iControl, statistical values are a 64-bit unsigned integer
       represented as a Common::ULong64 object.  The ULong64 object is a stuct
       of two 32-bit values.  This representation is used as there is no
       native support for the encoding of 64-bit numbers in SOAP.

       The ULong object has the following structure;

               ({
                       STATISTIC_NAME  => {
                                       high    => long
                                       low     => long
                               }
               }, bless Common::ULong64)

       Where high is the unsigned 32-bit integer value of the high-order
       portion of the measured value and low is the unsigned 32-bit integer
       value of the low-order portion of the measured value.

       In non-stringified statistic methods, these return values are ULong64
       objects as returned by the iControl API.  In stringified statistic
       method calls, the values are processed on the client side into a local
       64-bit representation of the value using the following form.

               $value = ($high<<32)|$low;

       Stringified method calls are guaranteed to return a correct localised
       64-bit representation of the value.

       It is the callers responsibility to convert the ULong struct for all
       other non-stringified statistic method calls.
