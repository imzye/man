NAME
       SWF - an autoloadable interface module for Ming - a library for
       generating ShockWave Flash format movies.

SYNOPSIS
               # Don't import other modules
               use SWF;

               # import all SWF modules
               use SWF qw(:ALL);

               # import SWF::Shape and SWF::Movie only.
               use SWF qw(Shape Movie);

DESCRIPTION
       By default, SWF doesn't import other SWF classes. You may, however,
       instruct SWF to import all modules by using the following syntax:

               use SWF qw(:ALL);

METHODS
       SWF::setScale($scale);
           Sets scale to $scale.

       SWF::getScale();
           Get the current scale. 20 means 20 twips (1/20 of a pixel) and is
           the default value.

       SWF::setVersion($version);
           Sets SWF version for the header of flashfiles. Choose a value
           between 4 and 7 for your flashmovies. If you are unsure take 5.

       SWF::setCubicThreshold($num)
           Sets the threshold error for drawing cubic beziers.  Lower is more
           accurate, hence larger file size.

       SWF::setSWFCompression($level);
           Set output compression level.  Returns previous value.  $level is
           integer between 0 and 9.  Note: This function is called automatic
           too by    $movie->save($filename[,$level]) and
                $movie->output([$level]) if the optional parameter $level is
           given.

       SWF::useConstants($flags);
           ?
