DESCRIPTION
       wmconfig is a program that will produce output consisting of menu
       definitions compatible with the selected window manager. You can
       include that output in your .rc file or have the output read through a
       pipe for dynamic configurations.


   How does it work ?
       wmconfig will read all the files located in /usr/local/etc/wmconfig. It
       will then read the files from the .wmconfig directory in the user's
       home directory. Therefore, the user's settings will override the
       system-wide settings. If optionally any extra files are given as an
       argument on the command line, those will be read last and merged with
       the others (possibly overriding the settings in system and user home
       dir files)

       Each of these files have the following format. For example, here's the
       gv package:

            gv name "Ghostview"
            gv icon "ghostview.bmp"
            gv mini-icon "mini-gv.xpm"
            gv exec "gv &"
            gv group "Graphics/Viewers"
            gv terminal "true"

            gv restart "quit"

   Config File Definition
       The format of the config file is:
       <package> <tag string>

   package
       denotes the name of the package, and is used internally by wmconfig to
       group together multiple tags intended for the same application. This
       item does not have any other special meaning.

   tag
       This can have several possible values. Among them:

       name   This is the name of the application, as it should be displayed
              in the menu.
              Example: name "My Cute Application"

       icon   This is the filename of an icon for this application. Use of
              full paths is discouraged because not all window managers can
              read and cope with full paths in icon names. Try to put your
              icons in a place where your window manager can find them by
              default.
              Example: icon "my-icon.xpm"

       mini-icon
              Some window managers support mini icons in menus or title bars,
              etc. This tag is intended for those kind of window managers
              (among them, mwm, fvwm2, fvwm95, icewm). The same remarks from
              the icon tag apply here. See the example from icon.

       copy   This will result in the configuration (entries) for this
              application being completed (by copying) from another
              application.
              Example: copy anotherpackage

       exec   This is the command that will be excuted by the window manager
              when this menu entry is selected.
              Example: exec "pine"

       group  This is the group you want to have you application listed under.
              The group items are separated by / (that is a forward slash).
              Groups are created on the fly, so you do have to be careful with
              typos!.
              Example: group "Applications/Graphics Utilities/Viewers"
              The above example will generate code (for the window manager of
              your choice) to generate a menu entry named Applications with
              another menu entry under it named Graphics Utilities and finaly
              a menu entry under that one named Viewers containing your
              application as an entry.

       mimetype
              The Mimetype description is used for KDE, KDE2, KDE3 and KDE4
              output to describe that the Application can be used for several
              Filetypes. Use semicolons for more than one mimetype. The last
              semicolon is not needed.
              Example: mimetype "text/enligsh;text/x-csrc"

       terminal
              This option describes that Wmconfig should append a terminal
              line to the exec entry. If you don't want to start the
              application with a terminal, delete the line. Wmconfig only
              checks if the terminal line exists.
              Example: terminal "yup"

       restart
              This option signals Wmconfig to create a special quit, restart
              or restart with Windowmanager menu entry. If the quit option is
              specified, Wmconfig will create a Quit entry. A restart entry is
              created with the restart option. Other options will be used as a
              name of a Windowmanager. A restart entry for the specified
              Windowmanager will be created.
              Examples: restart "quit"
                        restart "restart"
                        restart "startkde"

       User config files in $HOME/.wmconfig can have multiple packages defined
       in there; order does not matter. The only way to have an app in two
       different groups is to use copy to copy another package and override
       the group setting.


OPTIONS
       --output=manager
              Where manager can currently be one of: debug, fvwm95, fvwm2,
              afterstep, mwm, icewm, blackbox, wmaker, kde1, twm, olwm, fvwm,
              mlvwm, kde2, kde3, kde4, qvwm, pekwm, golem, fluxbox, gnome2,
              openbox, aewm, amiwm, kahakai, pwm, e16, enlightenment, e17,
              ede, equinox, ude, xfce, wmx, flwm, tvtwm, vtwm, piewm, ctwm,
              freedesktop, jvm, sithwm, sawfish.
              The only entry which is special in this list is the debug entry,
              which will produce a nice tree-like output to debug your
              settings and show you how the data is represented internally by
              wmconfig.


       --flag=flags
              Where flags can be one of:
              no-icons - this will tell wmconfig not to produce any icon-
              related output. You might want to do this if you don't want to
              have Icon styles applied to your application in your window
              manager.  For instance, if you don't want to have iconified
              windows on the desktop.
              no-mini-icons - the same thing, except for mini-icons (currently
              only supported by fvwm2, fvwm95 and afterstep).
              directories - some window managers are expecting their menu
              configuration as a hierarchy of directories/files. This option
              is working together with --output setting. Currently it is known
              to work only when invoked with --output=afterstep, and it will
              create the directories/files in
              ~/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep/start. This path can be changed
              using --outputdir switch.
              newstyle-directories - enhanced version of directories. Menu has
              mini-icons. Only for AfterStep >= 1.5.
              no-check-existence - By default, Wmconfig checks if the app
              defined in the configuration file exists. If not, no menu entry
              is created. By using this flag, you can turn off this behaviour.
              promote - Some people find it irritating to have menus with only
              one app in. This flag entry will be promoted to the higher level
              menu.
              If you want to specify more than one flag at a time, you can
              either repeat the --flag switch, or list all the flags comma-
              separated with no spacing in between.
              Example:
                   --flag=flag1,flag2,flag3 or
                   --flag=flag1 --flag=flag2 ...


       --sysdir=system_directory
              This switch is used to set the system directory instead of using
              the default (which is /usr/local/etc/wmconfig).


       --userdir=user_directory
              The default value for this switch is .wmconfig. This means that
              a directory called $HOME/.wmconfig will be searched for files
              containing valid wmconfig entries, and will be read after the
              system directory is read. By using --userdir you have a way to
              change that value.

       --rootmenu=root_menu_name
              By default, the name of the root menu is RootStart. If you want
              wmconfig to begin generating entryies starting at a certain
              point in your already-existing menu tree, you will want to use
              this switch.


       --outputdir=output_directory
              The default output directory is
              ~/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep/start.  For the Enlightenment DR16
              directory output the default directory is
              ~/.enlightenment/wmconfig.  For the Freedesktop output this
              switch describes where the menu XML configuration will be
              created. This enhances compatiblity with several XDG
              configuration scenarios. As example if
              /etc/xdg/menus/e17-applications.menu is the E17 system menu
              configuration choosing ~/.config/menus/e17-merged as option will
              let Wmconfig create the menu definition at the given place. This
              enhances compatiblity with several desktop environments and
              should ensure the Wmconfig menu is always shown.  Using this
              switch you can tell wmconfig to generate menu tree in specified
              path. Works only for --output=afterstep with directories or
              newstyle-directories flags, for --output=enlightenment, for
              --output=kde1, --output=kde2, --output=kde3,
              --output=freedesktop and for --output=kde4.


       --terminal=terminal_name
              This option is used for menu entries that require a terminal to
              start. If Wmconfig finds the terminal option, it automatically
              appends xterm to the exec line.  If you do not want to use
              xterm, you may specify an alternative terminal with this option.


       --no-icons
              Does the same thing as --flag=no-icons

       --no-mini-icons
              Does the same thing as --flag=no-mini-icons

       --directories
              Does the same thing as --flag=directories

       --newstyle-directories
              Does the same thing as --flag=newstyle-directories

       --promote
              Does the same thing as --flag=no-promote

       --no-sysdir
              Do not parse the files from the system-wide settings
              (/usr/local/etc/wmconfig) directory.

       --no-userdir
              Do not parse the files from the user's $HOME/.wmconfig
              directory.


       --help This is the popular "show me the help-screen !" switch.


       --version
              This is the popular "what version was that ?" switch.
