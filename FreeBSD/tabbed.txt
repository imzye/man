TABBED(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              TABBED(1)

NAME
       tabbed - generic tabbed interface

SYNOPSIS
       tabbed [-c] [-d] [-k] [-s] [-v] [-g geometry] [-n name] [-p
       [s{+/-}]pos] [-o normbgcol] [-O normfgcol] [-t selbgcol] [-T selfgcol]
       [-u urgbgcol] [-U urgfgcol] [-r narg] [command ...]

DESCRIPTION
       tabbed is a simple tabbed container for applications which support
       XEmbed. Tabbed will then run the provided command with the xid of
       tabbed as appended argument. (See EXAMPLES.) The automatic spawning of
       the command can be disabled by providing the -s parameter. If no
       command is provided tabbed will just print its xid and run no command.

OPTIONS
       -c     close tabbed when the last tab is closed. Mutually exclusive
              with -f.

       -d     detaches tabbed from the terminal and prints its XID to stdout.

       -f     fill up tabbed again by spawning the provided command, when the
              last tab is closed. Mutually exclusive with -c.

       -g geometry
              defines the X11 geometry string, which will fixate the height
              and width of tabbed.  The syntax is
              [=][width{xX}height][{+-}xoffset{+-}yoffset].  See
              XParseGeometry(3) for further details.

       -k     close foreground tabbed client (instead of tabbed and all
              clients) when WM_DELETE_WINDOW is sent.

       -n name
              will set the WM_CLASS attribute to name.

       -p [s{+-}]pos
              will set the absolute or relative position of where to start a
              new tab. When pos is is given without 's' in front it is an
              absolute position. Then negative numbers will be the position
              from the last tab, where -1 is the last tab.  If 's' is given,
              then pos is a relative position to the current selected tab. If
              this reaches the limits of the tabs; those limits then apply.

       -r narg
              will replace the narg th argument in command with the window id,
              rather than appending it to the end.

       -s     will disable automatic spawning of the command.

       -o normbgcol
              defines the normal background color.  #RGB, #RRGGBB, and X color
              names are supported.

       -O normfgcol
              defines the normal foreground color.

       -t selbgcol
              defines the selected background color.

       -T selfgbcol
              defines the selected foreground color.

       -u urgbgcol
              defines the urgent background color.

       -U urgfgbcol
              defines the urgent foreground color.

       -v     prints version information to stderr, then exits.

CUSTOMIZATION
       tabbed can be customized by creating a custom config.h and
       (re)compiling the source code. This keeps it fast, secure and simple.
