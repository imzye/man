NAME
       sigrok-fwextract-hantek-dso - Extract Hantek DSO-2xxx/52xx firmware

SYNOPSIS
       sigrok-fwextract-hantek-dso [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       This tool extracts firmware from the driver that comes with the Hantek
       DSO-2xxx/52xx series USB oscilloscopes. Find the 32-bit driver
       installed on the Windows system -- typically called DSOxxxx1.sys or
       DsoxxxxX861.sys, where xxxx is your device's model.

       Use it like this:

         $ sigrok-fwextract-hantek-dso Dso2090X861.sys
         saved 4730 bytes to hantek-dso-2090.fw

       Copy the resulting file over to the location where libsigrok expects to
       find its firmware files. By default this is
       /usr/local/share/sigrok-firmware.

OPTIONS
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       Exits with 0 on success, 1 on most failures.
