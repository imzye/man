KRB524_CONVERT_CREDS_KDC(3)                   FreeBSD Library Functions Manual

NAME
     krb524_convert_creds_kdc, krb524_convert_creds_kdc_ccache – converts
     Kerberos 5 credentials to Kerberos 4 credentials

LIBRARY
     Kerberos 5 Library (libkrb5, -lkrb5)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <krb5.h>

     krb5_error_code
     krb524_convert_creds_kdc(krb5_context context, krb5_creds *in_cred,
         struct credentials *v4creds);

     krb5_error_code
     krb524_convert_creds_kdc_ccache(krb5_context context, krb5_ccache ccache,
         krb5_creds *in_cred, struct credentials *v4creds);

DESCRIPTION
     Convert the Kerberos 5 credential to Kerberos 4 credential.  This is done
     by sending them to the 524 service in the KDC.

     krb524_convert_creds_kdc() converts the Kerberos 5 credential in in_cred
     to Kerberos 4 credential that is stored in credentials.

     krb524_convert_creds_kdc_ccache() is different from
     krb524_convert_creds_kdc() in that way that if in_cred doesn't contain a
     DES session key, then a new one is fetched from the KDC and stored in the
     cred cache ccache, and then the KDC is queried to convert the credential.

     This interfaces are used to make the migration to Kerberos 5 from
     Kerberos 4 easier.  There are few services that still need Kerberos 4,
     and this is mainly for compatibility for those services.  Some services,
     like AFS, really have Kerberos 5 supports, but still uses the 524
     interface to make the migration easier.
