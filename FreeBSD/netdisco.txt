NAME
       nd-import-topology - Import a Nedisco 1.x Manual Topology File

USAGE
        ~/bin/localenv nd-import-topology /path/to/netdisco-topology.txt

DESCRIPTION
       This helper script will read and import the content of a Netdisco 1.x
       format Manual Topology file into the Netdisco 2.x database's "topology"
       table.

       It's safe to run the script multiple times on the same file - any new
       data will be imported.

       The file syntax must be like so:

        left-device
          link:left-port,right-device,right-port

       The devices can be either host names or IPs. Data will be imported even
       if the devices are currently unknown to Netdisco. All imported devices
       will have a "discover" job queued for them.
