Module::Build::SDL(3)                      User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Module::Build::SDL - Module::Build subclass for building SDL apps/games
       [not stable yet]

SYNOPSIS
       When creating a new SDL application/game you can create Build.PL like
       this:

        use Module::Build::SDL;

        my $builder = Module::Build::SDL->new(
            module_name   => 'Games::Demo',
            dist_version  => '1.00',
            dist_abstract => 'Demo game based on Module::Build::SDL',
            dist_author   => 'coder@cpan.org',
            license       => 'perl',
            requires      => {
                'SDL'     => 0,
            },
            #+ others Module::Build options
        )->create_build_script();

       Once you have created a SDL application/game via Module::Build::SDL as
       described above you can use some extra build targets/actions:

       •   you can create a PAR distribution like:

            $ perl ./Build.PL
            $ ./Build
            $ ./Build par

           There are some extra parameters related to 'par' action you can
           pass to Module::Build::SDL->new():

            parinput  => 'bin/scriptname.pl'
            paroutput => 'filename.par.exe',
            parlibs   => [ qw/SDL SDL_main SDL_gfx/ ],  #external libraries (.so/.dll) to be included into PAR
            parmods   => [ qw/Module::A Module::B/ ],   #extra modules to be included into PAR

       •   to run the game from distribution directory you can use:

            $ perl ./Build.PL
            $ ./Build
            $ ./Build run

       •   TODO: maybe some additional actions: parexe, parmsi, deb, rpm

DESCRIPTION
       Module::Build::SDL is a subclass of Module::Build created to make easy
       some tasks specific to SDL applications - e.g. packaging SDL
       application/game into PAR archive.

APPLICATION/GAME LAYOUT
       Module::Build::SDL expects the following layout in project directory:

        #example: game with the main *.pl script + data files + modules (*.pm)
        Build.PL
        lib/
            Games/
                  Demo.pm
        bin/
            game-script.pl
        data/
            whatever_data_files_you_need.jpg

       the most simple game should look like:

        #example: simple one-script apllication/game
        Build.PL
        bin/
           game-script.pl

       In short - there are 3 expected subdirectories:

       •   bin - one or more perl scripts (*.pl) to start the actual
           application/game

       •   lib - application/game specific modules (*.pm) organized in dir
           structure in "usual perl manners"

       •   data - directory for storing application data (pictures, sounds
           etc.). This subdirectory is handled as a "ShareDir" (see
           File::ShareDir for more details)

       •   As the project is (or could be) composed as a standard perl
           distribution it also support standard subdirectory 't' (with
           tests).

RULES TO FOLLOW
       When creating a SDL application/game based on Module::Build::SDL it is
       recommended to follow these rules:

       •   Use the name for your game from Games::* namespace; it will make
           the later release to CPAN much easier.

       •   Put all data files into data subdirectory and access the data
           subdir only via File::ShareDir (namely by calling distdir()
           function)

       •   TODO: maybe add more
