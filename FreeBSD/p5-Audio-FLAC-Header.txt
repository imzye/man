NAME
       Audio::FLAC::Header - interface to FLAC header metadata.

SYNOPSIS
               use Audio::FLAC::Header;
               my $flac = Audio::FLAC::Header->new("song.flac");

               my $info = $flac->info();

               foreach (keys %$info) {
                       print "$_: $info->{$_}\n";
               }

               my $tags = $flac->tags();

               foreach (keys %$tags) {
                       print "$_: $tags->{$_}\n";
               }

DESCRIPTION
       This module returns a hash containing basic information about a FLAC
       file, a representation of the embedded cue sheet if one exists,  as
       well as tag information contained in the FLAC file's Vorbis tags.
       There is no complete list of tag keys for Vorbis tags, as they can be
       defined by the user; the basic set of tags used for FLAC files include:

               ALBUM
               ARTIST
               TITLE
               DATE
               GENRE
               TRACKNUMBER
               COMMENT

       The information returned by Audio::FLAC::info is keyed by:

               MINIMUMBLOCKSIZE
               MAXIMUMBLOCKSIZE
               MINIMUMFRAMESIZE
               MAXIMUMFRAMESIZE
               TOTALSAMPLES
               SAMPLERATE
               NUMCHANNELS
               BITSPERSAMPLE
               MD5CHECKSUM

       Information stored in the main hash that relates to the file itself or
       is calculated from some of the information fields is keyed by:

               trackLengthMinutes      : minutes field of track length
               trackLengthSeconds      : seconds field of track length
               trackLengthFrames       : frames field of track length (base 75)
               trackTotalLengthSeconds : total length of track in fractional seconds
               bitRate                 : average bits per second of file
               fileSize                : file size, in bytes

CONSTRUCTORS
   "new ($filename)"
       Opens a FLAC file, ensuring that it exists and is actually an FLAC
       stream, then loads the information and comment fields.

INSTANCE METHODS
       •   info( [$key] )

           Returns a hashref containing information about the FLAC file from
           the file's information header.

           The optional parameter, key, allows you to retrieve a single value
           from the info hash.  Returns "undef" if the key is not found.

       •   tags( [$key] )

           Returns a hashref containing tag keys and values of the FLAC file
           from the file's Vorbis Comment header.

           The optional parameter, key, allows you to retrieve a single value
           from the tag hash.  Returns "undef" if the key is not found.

       •   cuesheet( )

           Returns an arrayref which contains a textual representation of the
           cuesheet metada block. Each element in the array corresponds to one
           line in a .cue file. If there is no cuesheet block in this FLAC
           file the array will be empty. The resulting cuesheet should match
           the output of metaflac's --export-cuesheet-to option, with the
           exception of the FILE line, which includes the actual file name
           instead of "dummy.wav".

       •   seektable( )

           Returns the seektable. Currently disabled for performance.

       •   application( $appId )

           Returns the application block for the passed id.

       •   picture( [$type ] )

           Returns a hash containing data from a PICTURE block if found.

           Defaults to type 3 - "Front Cover"

           When the passed variable is 'all', an array of hashes containing
           picture data from all PICTURE blocks is returned. Allows for
           multiple instances of the same picture type.

       •   set_separator( )

           For multi-value ID3 tags, set the separator string. Defaults to '/'

       •   vendor_string( )

           Returns the vendor string.

       •   set_vendor_string( $string )

           Set the vendor string. Will be written on write()

       •   write( )

           Writes the current contents of the tag hash to the FLAC file, given
           that there's enough space in the header to do so. If there's
           insufficient space available (using pre-existing padding), the file
           will remain unchanged, and the function will return a zero value.
