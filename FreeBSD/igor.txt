IGOR(1)                 FreeBSD General Commands Manual                IGOR(1)

NAME
     igor – automated proofreading for documentation files

SYNOPSIS
     igor -h
     igor [-abcdefilmnoprstuvwxyzDERSWXZ] [-C linerange] [-L linelen] [-V VID]
          [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     igor proofreads documentation files to detect problems.  The goal is to
     make formatting and problem detection easier, allowing the writer to
     concentrate on the content.

     Some tests can be performed on all files, while others are specific to
     mdoc(7) or DocBook files.  igor uses file(1) to detect a file's type and
     only runs the applicable tests on it.

     Files compressed with gzip(1) or bzip(2) are automatically decompressed.
     If multiple files are specified, filenames are displayed before each is
     analyzed.  If no files are given, input is read from stdin.

     By default, all tests are performed.  If options for individual tests are
     given, only those tests will be done.  Several shortcut options make
     testing common combinations easier; see the SHORTCUT OPTIONS section
     below.

HELP OPTIONS
     -h        Show a usage summary and exit.

DISPLAY FORMAT OPTIONS
     -R        Produce output with ANSI color highlighting, to be used with
               the -R option of less(1).  If -R is not given, "[" and "]" are
               used to mark problem areas.

     -C linerange
               Restrict output to a range of lines from the file being
               checked.  Some tests process the entire file and will be
               silently skipped when -C is used.  linerange consists of start
               and end line numbers separated by a colon or dash.  Start or
               end may be omitted:

               -C 1000-2000  Show problems on lines 1000 to 2000 of the file.

               -C 1000:      Show problems from line 1000 on.

               -C -2000      Show problems up to line 2000.

     -v        Be verbose with diagnostic and status messages.

     -V VID    Limit output to a specific VuXML vulnerability VID, or use the
               literal keyword “latest” to specify the most recent (first
               listed) vulnerability in the VuXML file.

     -X        Produce Checkstyle XML output.  This overrides -R.

SHORTCUT OPTIONS
     -D        Do all mdoc(7) tests but ignore the document date (.Dd).  Use
               this option to skip needless warnings about the document date
               while a man page is being revised.  When ready for the actual
               commit, run igor without this option to check the date.
               Equivalent to -abefmrsuw.

     -z        Run all applicable non-whitespace (content) tests on a
               document.  Use this test to find content problems that will
               require retranslation of a document.

     -Z        Run all applicable whitespace tests on a document.  Use this to
               find whitespace-only problems that can be fixed without
               requiring retranslation of a document.

TESTS FOR ALL FILE TYPES
     -a      Verify proper usage of abbreviations like "e.g." and "i.e.".

     -b      Check for usage of bad phrases like "equally as" and some
             unfortunate contractions like "gzip'd" (the preferred form is
             "gzipped" for ASCII or mdoc(7), or "<command>gzip</command>ped"
             for DocBook.)

     -f      Check for mentions of obsolete FreeBSD features like "cvsup".

     -r      Check for repeated words like "is is" or "and and".

     -s      Detect spelling errors.  This test looks for known misspellings
             found in existing FreeBSD documents.  Additional files of
             misspelled words may be added with the IGORSPELLFILES environment
             variable, or placed in the /usr/local/etc/igor/spelling
             directory.  The first word on each line, including apostrophes,
             will be included in the list of known misspellings to be checked.
             Blank lines and lines starting with a # character are ignored.
             The Debian project has a list of words at
             http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=lintian/lintian.git;a=blob_plain;f=vendors/debian/ftp-master-auto-reject/data/spelling/corrections;hb=HEAD

     -u      Identify contractions, which make translation more difficult.

     -w      Find general whitespace errors, including trailing whitespace at
             the end of lines, blank lines containing whitespace, and tabs
             following a space.

     -y      Analyze and report on the writing style used in the document.
             This test is off by default.

TESTS FOR MDOC(7) FILES
     -d      Check whether document date (.Dd) has been set to today's date,
             as it should be when there have been nontrivial changes to a man
             page.  (See the -D option below.)

     -e      Verify that sentences start on a new line.  mdoc(7) does not
             enforce this, it is a style issue.

     -g      Look for duplicated external references in the SEE ALSO section
             of a man page.

     -m      Check for minimal mdoc(7) document structure.

     -p      Check for mdoc(7) whitespace style, like no blank lines.

     -x      Check for the existence of external references (.Xr).  Due to a
             tendency for false positives with these tests, they are off by
             default.

TESTS FOR DOCBOOK FILES
     -c      Check title capitalization against AP style rules.  Portions of
             titles wrapped in tags like <filename> are ignored.

     -i      Check indentation.

     -l      Check for long lines.  The default line length is 70 characters,
             the recommended value from the FDP Primer (see SEE ALSO below).
             The line length value may be overridden with -L linelen.

     -n      Verify that sentences start with two spaces.

     -o      Verify that open and close tags like <para> and </para> occur in
             matching pairs.

     -t      Check for tag usage style problems, like using <programlisting>
             inside a <para>.

     -E      Check for DocBook writing style problems, including redundant use
             of markup and text like

                   Edit the <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> file.

             This can be expressed less redundantly as

                   Edit <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>.

     -L      Set the preferred line length (see -l above.)

     -S      Check for "straggler" tags that are on the next line when they
             should be up against the content preceding them, or undesired
             whitespace before or after the content.  Although this is
             whitespace, it is content, too.  Any change of these spaces
             inside one of these tags is a content change that should also be
             changed in translations.  Because of that, the straggler test is
             part of the content tests run with -z rather than the whitespace
             tests.

     -W      Test for DocBook-specific whitespace problems, including
             multiples of eight spaces at the start of a line which should be
             replaced with tabs, tabs hidden inside text, and odd numbers of
             spaces used for indentation.

ENVIRONMENT
     IGORSPELLFILES  A list of whitespace-delimited filenames containing
                     additional misspelled words.

FILES
     /usr/local/etc/igor/spelling/  Directory for additional misspelled word
                                    files.

EXAMPLES
     Check gpart.8.gz for all errors, showing them with ANSI highlights.

           igor -R gpart.8.gz | less -R -S

     Check tuning.7.gz for all mdoc(7) errors except document date (.Dt), then
     show a writing style analysis.

           igor -R -D -y /usr/share/man/man7/tuning.7.gz | less -RS

     Check a file from stdin, showing messages in plain text.

           cat README | igor -R

     Check a DocBook file for non-whitespace (content) errors.

           igor -Rz chapter.xml | less -RS

     Check the same DocBook file for only whitespace errors.

           igor -RZ chapter.xml | less -RS

     Check a file for all errors found on lines 829 through 1488.

           igor -R -C 829:1488 chapter.xml | less -RS

     Check all the English DocBook files.

           igor -R `find /usr/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/ -name "*.xml"` | less -RS

     Check all the man pages in a directory, ignoring the document date.

           igor -RD /usr/share/man/man8/* | less -RS
