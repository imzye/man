Try::Catch(3)         User Contributed Perl Documentation        Try::Catch(3)


NAME
       Try::Catch - Try Catch exception handler based on Try::Tiny But faster

SYNOPSIS
           use Try::Catch;

           try {
               die "something went wrong";
           } catch {

           } finally {

               ##some cleanup code

           }; ##<--- semi colon is required.

DESCRIPTION
       A small, fast, try catch blocks for perl, it's inspired and mostly
       copied from Try::Tiny but with some modifications to boost execution
       speed, see "Benchmarks".

       I published a new module instead of contributing to Try::Tiny directly
       because I had to break some features available in Try::Tiny some to
       boost speed and some because I didn't like.

Differences
       no multiple finally blocks
       try must be followed by catch, catch then finally, or finally
           this behaves exactly as how other implementations of try catch
           blocks

       if there is no catch block error will throw
           in case of try followed by finally block and no catch block,
           finally block will be fired then an exception will be thrown, this
           is also the default behaviour of try catch in other languages.

CAVEATS
       Same as "CAVEATS" in Try::Tiny

Benchmarks
       This is not totally fair but please consider Try::Catch a stripped
       Try::Tiny version with no blessing and no usage of Sub::Name, so it
       must be faster, right! :)

       This is a simple test with just a try catch blocks with no exception

           |  Module:      | Rate          | %         |
           |-------------------------------------------|
           |  Try::Tiny    | 98425/s       | -68%      |
           |  Try::Catch   | 304878/s      | 210%      |

       Test with Try Catch, Finally Blocks, No Exception

           |  Module:      | Rate          | %         |
           |-------------------------------------------|
           |  Try::Tiny    | 60423/s       | -75%      |
           |  Try::Catch   | 245700/s      | 304%      |

       Test with Try, Catch, Finally Blocks, AND Exception

           |  Module:      | Rate          | %         |
           |-------------------------------------------|
           |  Try::Tiny    | 41288/s       | -65%      |
           |  Try::Catch   | 116414/s      | 182%      |

       I've also tested against TryCatch and the results were good,
       considering that TryCatch is an XS module

           |  Module:      |  timing 500000 iterations                              |
           |----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
           |  TryCatch     |  1 secs (0.58 usr + 0.00 sys = 0.58 CPU) @ 865051.90/s |
           |  Try::Catch   |  2 secs (1.73 usr + 0.00 sys = 1.73 CPU) @ 288350.63/s |
           |  Try::Tiny    |  6 secs (6.16 usr + 0.02 sys = 6.17 CPU) @ 81011.02/s  |

Known Bugs
       When doing block jump from try { } or catch { } then finally will not
       be called.

       For example

           use Try::Catch;
           for (1) {
               try {
                   die;
               } catch {
                   goto skip;
               } finally {
                   #finally will not be called
                   print "finally was called\n";
               }
           }
           skip:

       finally will work in most cases unless there is a block jump (last,
       goto, exit, ..) so I recommend avoid using finally at all as it's
       planned to be removed in v2.0.0
