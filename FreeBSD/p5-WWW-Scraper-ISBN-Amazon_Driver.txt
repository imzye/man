WWW::Scraper::ISBN::AmazonUK_Driver(3)     User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       WWW::Scraper::ISBN::AmazonUK_Driver - Search driver for Amazon.co.uk

SYNOPSIS
       See parent class documentation (WWW::Scraper::ISBN::Driver)

DESCRIPTION
       Searches for book information from the (UK) Amazon online catalog.

METHODS
       search()
           Creates a query string, then passes the appropriate form fields to
           the Amazon (UK) server.

           The returned page should be the correct catalog page for that ISBN.
           If not the function returns zero and allows the next driver in the
           chain to have a go. If a valid page is returned, the following
           fields are returned via the book hash:

             isbn          (now returns isbn13)
             isbn10
             isbn13
             ean13         (industry name)
             author
             title
             book_link
             thumb_link
             image_link
             pubdate
             publisher
             binding       (if known)
             pages         (if known)
             weight        (if known) (in grams)
             width         (if known) (in millimetres)
             height        (if known) (in millimetres)
             depth         (if known) (in millimetres)

           The book_link, thumb_link and image_link refer back to the Amazon
           (UK) website.
