TICKIT_BUILD(3)        FreeBSD Library Functions Manual        TICKIT_BUILD(3)

NAME
       tickit_build - create a new toplevel Tickit instance with arguments

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tickit.h>

       struct TickitBuilder {
         TickitTerm *tt;
         struct TickitTermBuilder term_builder;
         ...
       };

       Tickit *tickit_build(const struct TickitBuilder *builder);

       Link with -ltickit.

DESCRIPTION
       tickit_build() creates a new toplevel Tickit instance initialised from
       the various parameters given in the builder struct. Note that the above
       definition for the struct is incomplete; the actual struct definition
       contains more fields than shown as some are for internal purposes. User
       code should only attempt to interact with those fields documented here.

       If the tt field is set, it should contain a TickitTerm instance. If
       left blank, then one will be constructed by passing the nested
       term_builder structure to tickit_term_build(3).

RETURN VALUE
       If successful, tickit_build() returns a pointer to the new instance. On
       failure, NULL is returned with errno set to indicate the failure.
