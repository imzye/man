NAME
       canonical-genetic-algorithm.pl - Canonical Genetic Algorithm on a
       simple fitness function

SYNOPSIS
         prompt% ./canonical-genetic-algorithm.pl <bits> <block size> <population> <number of generations> <selection rate>

DESCRIPTION
       A canonical GA uses mutation, crossover, binary representation, and
           roulette wheel selection. Here mainly for reference, and so that
           you can peruse to start your own programs.

       In this case, we are optimizing the Royal Road function,
       <http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mm/handbook-of-ec-rr.pdf>. By default, these
       values are used:

       •   number of bits: 64 (this is the chromosome length)

       •   size of block: 4 (RR goes by blocks)

       •   population size: 256

       •   number of generations: 200 (could end before, if solution is found)

       •   selection rate: 20% (will be replaced each generation); this means
           it's a steady state algorithm, which only changes a part of the
           population each generation.

       This program also demonstrates the use of caches in the fitness
       evaluation, so be careful if you use too many bits or too many
       generations, check the memory.

       Output shows the number of generations, the winning chromosome, and
       fitness. After finishing, it outputs time, cache ratio and some other
       things.

SEE ALSO
       First, you should obviously check
           Algorithm::Evolutionary::Op::CanonicalGA, and then these other
       classes.
