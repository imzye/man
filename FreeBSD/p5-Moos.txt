REMOOS(1)             User Contributed Perl Documentation            REMOOS(1)


Name
       remoos - Rewrite Moos.pm into Your Own Module

Synopsis
           remoos My::Base::Class > lib/My/Base/Class.pm

Description
       Moos is a Moose-esque Perl OO framework that lives in one single file.
       That makes it easy to turn it into your Perl module distribution's own
       OO base class. This remoos utility makes it easier.

       The "remoos" utility simply reads in a copy of Moos.pm, changes all the
       references of Moos to your module's name, and writes the result to
       stdout.

       It will also remove comments and documentation, and add a comment at
       the top indicating that it was derived from Moos.
