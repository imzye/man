NAME
       POE::Component::Cron - Schedule POE Events using a cron spec

SYNOPSIS
           use POE::Component::Cron;

           $s1 = POE::Session->create(
               inline_states => {
                   _start => sub {
                      $_[KERNEL]->delay( _die_, 120 );
                   }

                   Tick => sub {
                      print 'tick ', scalar localtime, "\n";
                   },
               }
           );

           # crontab schedule the easy wa
           $sched =
             POE::Component::Cron->from_cron( '* * * * *' => $s2->ID => 'Tick' );

           # delete some schedule of events
           $sched->delete();

DESCRIPTION
       This component extends POE::Component::Schedule by adding an easy way t
       specify event schedules using a simple cron spec.

METHODS
   from_cron
       Add a schedule using a simple syntax for plain old cron spec.

           POE::Component::Cron-> from_cron('*/5 */2 * * 1' => session => event);

       Accepts the cron syntax as defined by DateTime::Event::Cron which is
       pretty the same as that used by common linux cron.

SEE ALSO

       DateTime::Event::Cron.
