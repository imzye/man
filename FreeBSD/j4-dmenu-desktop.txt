SYNOPSIS
              j4-dmenu-desktop [--dmenu="dmenu -i"]
              [--term="i3-sensible-terminal"]

OPTIONS
       --dmenu=<command>
              Determines the command used to invoke dmenu Executed with your
              shell ($SHELL) or /bin/sh

       --use-xdg-de
              Enables reading $XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP to determine the desktop
              environment

       --display-binary
              Display binary name after each entry (off by default)

       --no-generic
              Do not include the generic name of desktop entries

       --term=<command>
              Sets the terminal emulator used to start terminal apps

       --usage-log=<file>
              Must point to a read-writeable file (will create if not exists).
              In this mode entries are sorted by usage frequency.

       --wait-on=<path>
              Must point to a path where a file can be created.  In this mode
              no menu will be shown. Instead the program waits for <path> to
              be written to (use echo > path). Every time this happens a menu
              will be shown.  Desktop files are parsed ahead of time.
              Perfoming 'echo -n q > path' will exit the program.

       --no-exec
              Do not execute selected command, send to stdout instead
