VCOUNT(9)              FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual             VCOUNT(9)

NAME
     vcount, count_dev – get total number of references to a device

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <sys/time.h>
     #include <sys/conf.h>
     #include <sys/vnode.h>

     int
     vcount(struct vnode *vp);

     int
     count_dev(struct cdev *dev);

DESCRIPTION
     vcount() is used to get the number of references to a particular device.
     It allows for the fact that multiple vnodes may reference the same
     device.  count_dev() does the same thing as vcount(), but takes a struct
     cdev rather than a struct vnode pointer as an argument.

RETURN VALUES
     vcount() and count_dev() both return the number of references to the
     device.

     VFS(9), vnode(9)
