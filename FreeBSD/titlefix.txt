NAME
       titlefix - rename titled files with English title case

SYNOPSIS
       titlefix [-t] [FILENAME|-a|-h|-l]

       titlefixid3 [-t] [FILENAME|-a|-h|-l]

       titleid3 [-t] [FILENAME|-a|-h|-l]

       single[fix][id3] [-t] [FILENAME|-a|-h|-l]

DESCRIPTION
       titlefix renames files, correcting titles with standard English title
       case -- all middle words in an artist or title are capitalized except:
       articles, prepositions, and conjunctions less than 5 letters long in
       the artist or title name

       When called as titleid3, it uses the formats described below to tag
       mp3s with ID3V2 and ID3V1 tag info, but does no renaming (for when case
       is to be preserved).

       When called as titlefixid3, it does both renaming and tagging, for
       example:

              titlefixid3 "12 Front 242 - One - With The Fire.mp3"


       results in this file name:

              "12 Front 242 - One - With the Fire.mp3"


       and tags the file with track number 12, artist "Front 242", and track
       title "One - With the Fire". The first dash with spaces on each side is
       considered the delimiter between artist and title. This example:

              titlefixid3 "11 Danny Elfman - To Die For - Main Titles.mp3"


       would not change the filename, since To and For are start and end words
       within the phrase separated by the spaced dash in the title.


NOTES
       One of these formats must be used for each mp3 file (titleid3 and
       titlefixid3):

              NN Artist - Title.mp3

              NN Title.mp3


       NN is used for the track number, Artist for artist, and Title for
       title. If the second format is used (i.e., there is no dash surrounded
       by spaces), no artist will be tagged, and the whole filename (minus the
       NN and .mp3) will be used as a title. When called as single[fix]id3, it
       assumes a format "Artist - Title.mp3" (i.e. no track number NN).

       -l, --list
              prints list of words to make lowercase and exits (ignores
