CATTAG(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              CATTAG(1)

NAME
       cattag - Print a random tagline


SYNOPSIS
       cattag [options] file ...

       cattag -h|--help


DESCRIPTION
       cattag prints a random tagline.  Taglines sources are specified the
       same as with gensig(1).

       See the man page for gensig(1) for more info about how cattag finds
       taglines files to use.


OPTIONS
       -a|--add
              Adds specified files to the taglines sources.  Otherwise,
              specified files replace the default tagfiles sources.


       -h|--help
              Display syntax & options.


       -d|--debug
              Display debug information (be verbose).


       -v|--version
              Display version information.


FILES
       Each line of text in a file of taglines is considered a tagline.
       Multiple-line taglines can be created by using a CR ('' in C) in the
       middle of the line.  The CR character will be replaced by a LF
       character ('0 in C) by cattag.


BUGS
       Bugs?  We don't need to steenking bugs!  (But we've probably got some
       anyway...)



WHO TO BLAME
       cattag was originally party of Andrew Arensburger's gensig package, but
       has been completely rewritten as part of the new gensig, by Rob Fugina
       (robf@geekthing.com).
