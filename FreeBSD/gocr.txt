GOCR(1)                          User's Manual                         GOCR(1)

NAME
       gocr - command line text recognition tool

SYNOPSIS
       gocr [OPTION] [-i] pnm-file

DESCRIPTION
       gocr is an optical character recognition program that can be used from
       the command line.  It takes input in PNM, PGM, PBM, PPM, or PCX format,
       and writes recognized text to stdout.  If the pnm file is a single
       dash, PNM data is read from stdin.  If gzip, bzip2 and netpbm-progs are
       installed and your system supports popen(3) also pnm.gz, pnm.bz2, png,
       jpg, jpeg, tiff, gif, bmp, ps (only single pages) and eps are supported
       as input files (not as input stream), where pnm can be replaced by one
       of ppm, pgm and pbm.

OPTIONS
       -h     show usage information

       -V     show version information

       -i file
              read input from file (or stdin if file is a single dash)

       -o file
              send output to file instead of stdout

       -e file
              send errors to file instead of stderr or to stdout if file is a
              dash

       -x file
              progress output to file (file can be a file name, a fifo name or
              a file descriptor 1...255), this is useful for GUI developpers
              to show the OCR progress, the file descriptor argument is only
              available, if compiled with __USE_POSIX defined

       -p path
              database path, a final slash must be included, default is ./db/,
              this path will be populated with images of learned characters

       -f format
              output format of the recognized text (ISO8859_1 TeX HTML XML
              UTF8 ASCII), XML will also output position and probability data

       -l level
              set grey level to level (0<160<=255, default: 0 for autodetect),
              darker pixels belong to characters, brighter pixels are
              interpreted as background of the input image

       -d size
              set dust size in pixels (clusters smaller than this are
              removed), 0 means no clusters are removed, the default is -1 for
              auto detection

       -s num set spacewidth between words in units of dots (default: 0 for
              autodetect), wider widths are interpreted as word spaces,
              smaller as character spaces

       -v verbosity
              be verbose to stderr; verbosity is a bitfield

       -c string
              only verbose output of characters from string to stderr, more
              output is generated for all characters within the string, the
              underscore stands for unknown chars, this function is usefull to
              limit debug information to the necessary one

       -C string
              only recognise characters from string, this is a filter function
              in cases where the interest is only to a part of the character
              alphabet, you can use 0-9 or a-z to specify ranges, use -- to
              detect the minus sign

       -a certainty
              set value for certainty of recognition (0..100; default: 95),
              characters with a higher certainty are accepted, characters with
              a lower certainty are treated as unknown (not recognized); set
              higher values, if you want to have only more certain recognized
              characters

       -u string
              output this string for every unrecognized character (default is
              "_")

       -m mode
              set oprational mode; mode is a bitfield (default: 0)

       -n bool
              if bool is non-zero, only recognise numbers (this is now
              obsolete, use -C "0123456789")

       The verbosity is specified as a bitfield:

       1         print more info

       2         list shapes of boxes (see -c) to stderr

       4         list pattern of boxes (see -c) to stderr

       8         print pattern after recognition for debugging

       16        print debug information about recognition of lines to stderr

       32        create outXX.png with boxes and lines marked on each general
                 OCR-step

       The operation modes are:

       2         use database to recognize characters which are not recognized
                 by other algorithms, (early development)

       4         switching on layout analysis or zoning (development)

       8         don't compare unrecognized characters to recognized one

       16        don't try to divide overlapping characters to two or three
                 single characters

       32        don't do context correction

       64        character packing, before recognition starts, similar
                 characters are searched and only one of this characters will
                 be send to the recognition engine (development)

       130       extend database, prompts user for unidentified characters and
                 extends the database with users answer (128+2, early
                 development)

       256       switch off the recognition engine (makes sense together with
                 -m 2)
