NAME
       Compress::LeadingBlankSpaces - Perl class to compress leading blank
       spaces in (HTML, JavaScript, etc.) web content.

SYNOPSIS
         use Compress::LeadingBlankSpaces;

         my $lco_r = Compress::LeadingBlankSpaces->new();
         . . .
         my $source_string = '     some content'."\n";
         . . .
         my $outgoing_string = $lco_r->squeeze_string ($source_string);
         . . .
         my $squeeze_status = $lco_r->format_status(); # to check later...

DESCRIPTION
       This class provides the functionality for the most simple web content
       compression.

       Basically, the outgoing web content (HTML, JavaScript, etc.) contains a
       lot of leading blank spaces, because of being structured on development
       stage.  Usually, the browser ignores all leading blank spaces.  Indeed,
       the amount of those blank spaces is significant and could be estimated
       as 10 to 20 percent of the length of regular web page.  We can reduce
       this part of the web traffic on busy servers with no visible impact on
       transferred web content. This could be helpful especially for old
       browsers incapable to understand modern content compression.

       The main functionality of this class is concentrated within the
       "squeeze_string" member function that is supposed to be used inside the
       data transfer loop on server side.  The rest of the class is developed
       to serve possible exceptions, like pre-formatted data within HTML.

       In this version of the class, there are three tags those produce
       compression exceptions:

       <CODE ...> ... </CODE>

       <PRE ...> ... </PRE>

       <TEXTAREA ...> ... </TEXTAREA>

       case insensitive in implementation.

       Nesting of exceptions is not supported.
