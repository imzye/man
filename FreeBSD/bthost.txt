BTHOST(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              BTHOST(1)

NAME
     bthost – look up Bluetooth host names and Protocol Service Multiplexor
     values

SYNOPSIS
     bthost [-bhp] host_or_protocol

DESCRIPTION
     The bthost utility looks for information about Bluetooth hosts and
     Protocol Service Multiplexor (PSM) values.  It gets this information from
     the /etc/bluetooth/hosts and /etc/bluetooth/protocols files.

     In host mode, it simply converts between the host names and Bluetooth
     addresses.  The argument can be either a host name or a Bluetooth
     address.  The program first attempts to interpret it as a Bluetooth
     address.  If this fails, it will treat it as a host name.  A Bluetooth
     address consists of six hex bytes separated by a colon, e.g.,
     “01:02:03:04:05:06”.  A host name consists of names separated by dots,
     e.g., “my.cell.phone”.

     In protocol mode, it simply converts between the Protocol Service
     Multiplexor names and assigned numbers.  The argument can be either a
     Protocol Service Multiplexor name or an assigned number.  The program
     first attempts to interpret it as an assigned number.

     The options are as follows:

     -b      Produce brief output.

     -h      Display usage message and exit.

     -p      Activate protocol mode.

     The bthost utility will print results to the standard output, and error
     messages to the standard error.  An output can be quite different, here
     is an example that demonstrates all of the possibilities:

           % bthost localhost
           Host localhost has address FF:FF:FF:00:00:00
           % bthost ff:ff:ff:00:00:00
           Host FF:FF:FF:00:00:00 has name localhost
           % bthost -b localhost
           FF:FF:FF:00:00:00
           % bthost -b ff:ff:ff:00:00:00
           localhost
           % bthost do.not.exists
           do.not.exists: Unknown host
           % bthost 0:0:0:0:0:0
           00:00:00:00:00:00: Unknown host
           % bthost -p sdp
           Protocol/Service Multiplexor sdp has number 1
           % bthost -p 3
           Protocol/Service Multiplexor rfcomm has number 3
           % bthost -bp HID-Control
           17
           % bthost -p foo
           foo: Unknown Protocol/Service Multiplexor

FILES
     /etc/bluetooth/hosts
     /etc/bluetooth/protocols

EXIT STATUS
     The bthost utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
