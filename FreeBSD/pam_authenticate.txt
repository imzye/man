PAM_AUTHENTICATE(3)    FreeBSD Library Functions Manual    PAM_AUTHENTICATE(3)

NAME
     pam_authenticate – perform authentication within the PAM framework

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <security/pam_appl.h>

     int
     pam_authenticate(pam_handle_t *pamh, int flags);

DESCRIPTION
     The pam_authenticate() function attempts to authenticate the user
     associated with the pam context specified by the pamh argument.

     The application is free to call pam_authenticate() as many times as it
     wishes, but some modules may maintain an internal retry counter and
     return PAM_MAXTRIES when it exceeds some preset or hardcoded limit.

     The flags argument is the binary or of zero or more of the following
     values:

     PAM_SILENT          Do not emit any messages.

     PAM_DISALLOW_NULL_AUTHTOK
                         Fail if the user's authentication token is null.

     If any other bits are set, pam_authenticate() will return
     PAM_BAD_CONSTANT.

     The pam_authenticate() function returns one of the following values:

     [PAM_SUCCESS]       Success.
