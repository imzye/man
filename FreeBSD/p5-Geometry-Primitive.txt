Geometry::Primitive(3)                     User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Geometry::Primitive - Primitive Geometry Entities

SYNOPSIS
       Geometry::Primitive is a device and library agnostic system for
       representing geometric entities such as points, lines and shapes.  It
       provides simple objects and many convenience methods you would expect
       from a simple geometry library.

           use Geometry::Primitive::Point;

           my $foo = Geometry::Primitive::Point->new(x => 1, y => 3);
           ...

DISCLAIMER
       I'm not a math guy. I hate math. I will likely learn a lot in the
       process of making this library. If you are a math person you will
       probably look at this and find many things missing or wrong. Patches
       are encouraged. I will likely find that I've done something completely
       wrong having taken geometry over 10 years ago.  C'est la vie.

ENTITIES
       Arc
       Bezier
       Circle
       Ellipse
       Line
       Point
       Polygon
       Rectangle

SERIALIZATON
       All of the entities in this library support serialization via
       MooseX::Storage.  This is primarily to support serialization in
       consumers of this library, but may be useful for other purposes.  All
       classes are set to JSON format and File IO.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
       Many of the ideas here come from my experience using the Cairo library.
