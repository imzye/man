NAME
       HTTP::Engine - Web Server Gateway Interface and HTTP Server Engine
       Drivers

SYNOPSIS
         use HTTP::Engine;
         my $engine = HTTP::Engine->new(
             interface => {
                 module => 'ServerSimple',
                 args   => {
                     host => 'localhost',
                     port =>  1978,
                 },
                 request_handler => \&handle_request,
             },
         );
         $engine->run;

         sub handle_request {
             my $req = shift;
             HTTP::Engine::Response->new( body => "Hello world" );
         }

DESCRIPTION
       HTTP::Engine abstracts handling the input and output of various web
       server environments, including CGI, mod_perl and FastCGI. Most of the
       code is ported over from Catalyst::Engine.

       If you're familiar with WSGI for Python or Rack for Ruby, HTTP::Engine
       exactly does the same thing, for Perl.

WHY WOULD YOU USE HTTP::ENGINE
       CGI.pm is popular under the CGI environment and Apache::Request is
       great for better performance under mod_perl environment. The problem
       is, these HTTP request and response handling abstractions have
       incompatible interfaces, and it's not easy to switch between them.

       HTTP::Engine prepareas a HTTP::Engine::Request object for you which is
       optimized for your current environment, and pass that to your request
       handler. Your request handler then returns a HTTP::Engine::Response
       object, which we communicate back to the server for you.

       HTTP::Engine::Request covers the bases of common request process tasks,
       like handling GET and POST parameters, parsing HTTP cookies and
       processing file uploads. Unlike CGI.pm, but like most other web
       programming languages, it allows you to mix GET and POST parameters.

       And importantly, it allows you to seamlessly move your code from CGI to
       a persistent environment (like mod_perl or FastCGI) without rewriting
       your code. At the same time, you'll maintain the possibility of
       additional performance benefits, as HTTP::Engine can transparently take
       advantage of native mod_perl functions when they are available.

MIDDLEWARE
       Middleware is a framwork to extend HTTP::Engine, much like
       Catalyst::Plugin for Catalyst. Please see HTTP::Engine::Middleware.

INTERFACES
       Interfaces are the actual environment-dependent components which
       handles the actual interaction between your clients and the
       application.

       For example, in CGI mode, you can write to STDOUT and expect your
       clients to see it, but in mod_perl, you may need to use $r->print
       instead.

       Interfaces are the actual layers that does the interaction.
       HTTP::Engine currently supports the following:

       # XXX TODO: Update the list

       HTTP::Engine::Interface::ServerSimple
       HTTP::Engine::Interface::FastCGI
       HTTP::Engine::Interface::CGI
       HTTP::Engine::Interface::Test
           for test code interface

       HTTP::Engine::Interface::ModPerl
           experimental

       HTTP::Engine::Interface::Standalone
           old style

       Interfaces can be specified as part of the HTTP::Engine constructor:

         my $interface = HTTP::Engine::Interface::FastCGI->new(
           request_handler => ...
         );
         HTTP::Engine->new(
           interface => $interface
         )->run();

       Or you can let HTTP::Engine instantiate the interface for you:

         HTTP::Engine->new(
           interface => {
             module => 'FastCGI',
             args   => {
             }
             request_handler => ...
           }
         )->run();
