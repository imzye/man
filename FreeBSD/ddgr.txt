DDGR(1)                          User Commands                         DDGR(1)

NAME
       ddgr - DuckDuckGo from the terminal

SYNOPSIS
       ddgr [OPTIONS] [KEYWORD [KEYWORD ...]]

DESCRIPTION
       ddgr is a command-line tool to search DuckDuckGo (html version). ddgr
       shows the title, URL and text context for each result. Results are
       fetched in pages. Keyboard shortcuts are available for page navigation.
       Results are indexed and a result URL can be opened in a browser using
       the index number. There is no configuration file as aliases serve the
       same purpose for this utility. Supports sequential searches in a single
       instance.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Show help text and exit.

       -n, --num=N
              Show N results per page (default 10). N must be between 0 and
              25. N=0 disables fixed paging and shows actual number of results
              fetched per page.

       -r, --reg=REG
              Region-specific search e.g. 'us-en' for US (default); visit
              https://duckduckgo.com/params.

       -C, --nocolor
              Disable color output.

       --colors=COLORS
              Set output colors. Refer to the COLORS section below for
              details.

       -j, --ducky
              Open the first result in a web browser; implies --noprompt.
              Feeling Ducky?

       -t, --time=SPAN
              Time limit search [d=past day, w=past week, m=past month, y=past
              year] (default=any time).

       -w, --site=SITE
              Search a site using DuckDuckGo.

       -x, --expand
              Expand URLs instead of showing only the domain name (default).

       -p, --proxy=URI
              Tunnel traffic through an HTTP proxy. URI is of the form
              [http[s]://][user:pwd@]host[:port]. The proxy server must
              support HTTP CONNECT tunneling and must not block port 443 for
              the relevant DuckDuckGo hosts. If a proxy is not explicitly
              given, the https_proxy or HTTPS_PROXY environment variable (if
              available) is used instead.

       --unsafe
              Disable safe search.

       --noua Disable user agent. Results are fetched faster.

       --json Output in JSON format; implies --noprompt.

       --gb, --gui-browser
              Open a bang directly in a GUI browser.

       --np, --noprompt
              Perform search and exit; do not prompt for further interactions.

       --rev, --reverse
              List the entries in reversed order.

       --url-handler=UTIL
              Custom script or command-line utility to open urls with.

       --show-browser-logs
              Do not suppress browser output when opening result in browser;
              that is, connect stdout and stderr of the browser to ddgr's
              stdout and stderr instead of /dev/null. By default, browser
              output is suppressed (due to certain graphical browsers spewing
              messages to console) unless the BROWSER environment variable is
              a known text-based browser: elinks, links, lynx, w3m or www-
              browser.

       -v, --version
              Show version number and exit.

       -d, --debug
              Enable debugging.

OMNIPROMPT KEYS
       n, p, f
              Fetch the next, previous or first set of search results.

       index  Open the result corresponding to index in browser.

       o [index|range|a ...]
              Open space-separated result indices, numeric ranges or all
              indices, if 'a' is specified, in the browser.

       O [index|range|a ...]
              Works similar to key 'o', but tries to ignore text-based
              browsers (even if BROWSER is set) and open links in a GUI
              browser.

       d keywords
              Initiate a new DuckDuckGo search for keywords with original
              options. This key should be used to search omniprompt keys
              (including itself) and indices.

       x      Toggle url expansion.

       c index
              Copy url to clipboard.

       q, ^D, double Enter
              Exit ddgr.

       ?      Show omniprompt help.

       *      Any other string initiates a new search with original options.

COLORS
       ddgr allows you to customize the color scheme via a six-letter string,
       reminiscent of BSD LSCOLORS. The six letters represent the colors of

       - indices
       - titles
       - URLs
       - metadata/publishing info
       - abstracts
       - prompts

       respectively. The six-letter string is passed in either as the argument
       to the --colors option, or as the value of the environment variable
       DDGR_COLORS.
       We offer the following colors/styles:

         ┌───────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
         │Letter │ Color/Style                                       │

         └───────┴───────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
       The default colors string is oCdgxy, which stands for

       - bright cyan indices
       - bold green titles
       - yellow URLs
       - cyan metadata/publishing info
       - normal abstracts
       - reverse video prompts

       Note that

       - Bright colors (implemented as \x1b[90m - \x1b[97m) may not be
         available in all color-capable terminal emulators;

       - Some terminal emulators draw bold text in bright colors instead;

       - Some terminal emulators only distinguish between bold and bright
         colors via a default-off switch.

       Please consult the manual of your terminal emulator as well as
       https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code for details.

EXAMPLES
       1.  DuckDuckGo hello world:


              ddgr hello world

       2.  I'm Feeling Ducky search:


              ddgr -j lucky ducks

       3.  DuckDuckGo Bang search 'hello world' in Wikipedia:


              ddgr !w hello world
              ddgr \!w hello world // bash-specific, need to escape ! on bash


           Bangs work at the omniprompt too. To look up bangs, visit
           https://duckduckgo.com/bang?#bangs-list.

       4.  Bang alias to fire from the cmdline, open results in a GUI browser
           and exit:


              alias bang='ddgr --gb --np'

              bang !w hello world
              bang \!w hello world // bash-specific, need to escape ! on bash

       5.  Website specific search:


              ddgr -w amazon.com digital camera


           Site specific search continues at omniprompt.

       6.  Search for a specific file type:


              ddgr instrumental filetype:mp3

       7.  Fetch results on IPL cricket from India in English:


              ddgr -r in-en IPL cricket


           To find your region parameter token visit
           https://duckduckgo.com/params.

       8.  Search quoted text:


              ddgr it\'s a \"beautiful world\" in spring

       9.  Show complete urls in search results (instead of only domain name):


              ddgr -x ddgr

       10. Use a custom color scheme, e.g., one warm color scheme designed for
           Solarized Dark:


              ddgr --colors bjdxxy hello world

              DDGR_COLORS=bjdxxy ddgr hello world

       11. Tunnel traffic through an HTTPS proxy, e.g., a local Privoxy
           instance listening on port 8118:


              ddgr --proxy localhost:8118 hello world


           By default the environment variable https_proxy (or HTTPS_PROXY) is
           used, if defined.

       12. Look up n, p, o, O, q, d keywords or a result index at the
           omniprompt: as the omniprompt recognizes these keys or index
           strings as commands, you need to prefix them with d, e.g.,

              d n
              d d keywords
              d 1
