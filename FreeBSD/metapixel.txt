NAME
       metapixel - generator for photomosaics

SYNOPSIS
       metapixel-prepare [options] [srcdir] [destdir]

                         prepares the pictures in srcdir by creating resized
                         images and a table file in destdir


       metapixel [options]
                 [--metapixel input.jpg output.png --library destdir]

                 creates a photomosaic output.png using input.jpg as the input
                 image and destdir/tables.mxt as table file



DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the metapixel and metapixel-prepare
       commands. For more information check the README file included in the
       distribution.


       metapixel is a program for generating photomosaics. It can generate
       classical photomosaics, in which the source image is viewed as a matrix
       of equally sized rectangles for each of which a matching image is
       substitued, as well as collage-style photomosaics, in which rectangular
       parts of the source image at arbitrary positions (i.e. not aligned to a
       matrix) are substituted by matching images.


       metapixel-prepare is a utility that needs to be run before metapixel
       can be used. It prepares your source images so that they can be used by
       metapixel to create the actual photomosaic.


USAGE
       metapixel-prepare srcdir destdir has to be run first. srcdir is the
       path to the directory containing the source images, e.g.
       ~/Pictures/Holidays. destdir, e.g. ~/.metapixel, is the path to the
       directory where you want to store the rescaled images and the
       tables.mxt index file. This directory should be created manually before
       running metapixel-prepare.


       metapixel --metapixel input.jpg output.png --library destdir is then
       used to transform an image (input.jpg) into a mosaic (output.png) using
       the source images (described by destdir/tables.mxt).


OPTIONS
       The options are described in the README file or by running metapixel or
       metapixel-prepare with the --help option.


SEE ALSO
       The README file is included in the Metapixel distribution.
