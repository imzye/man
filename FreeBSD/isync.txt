NAME
       mbsync - synchronize IMAP4 and Maildir mailboxes

SYNOPSIS
       mbsync [options ...] {{channel[:box[{,|\n}...]]|group} ...|-a}
       mbsync --list-stores [options ...] [store ...]

DESCRIPTION
       mbsync is a command line application which synchronizes mailboxes;
       currently Maildir and IMAP4 mailboxes are supported.  New messages,
       message deletions and flag changes can be propagated both ways; the
       operation set can be selected in a fine-grained manner.
       Synchronization is based on unique message identifiers (UIDs), so no
       identification conflicts can occur (unlike with some other mail
       synchronizers).  OTOH, mbsync is susceptible to UID validity changes
       (but will recover just fine if the change is unfounded).
       Synchronization state is kept in one local text file per mailbox pair;
       these files are protected against concurrent mbsync processes.
       Mailboxes can be safely modified while mbsync operates (see INHERENT
       PROBLEMS below for a minor exception).  Multiple replicas of each
       mailbox can be maintained.

OPTIONS
       -c, --config file
              Read configuration from file.  By default, the configuration is
              read from $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/isyncrc, and if that does not exist,
              ~/.mbsyncrc is tried in turn.  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to
              ~/.config if not set.

       -a, --all
              Select all configured Channels. Any Channel/Group specifications
              on the command line are ignored.

       -l, --list
              Don't synchronize anything, but list all mailboxes in the
              selected Channels and exit.

       -ls, --list-stores
              Don't synchronize anything, but list all mailboxes in the
              selected Stores and exit.  If no Stores are specified, all
              configured ones are listed.  These are raw Store contents, not
              filtered by any Channel's Patterns.  This option may be used to
              verify each Store's configuration.

       -C[f][n], --create[-far|-near]
              Override any Create options from the config file. See below.

       -R[f][n], --remove[-far|-near]
              Override any Remove options from the config file. See below.

       -X[f][n], --expunge[-far|-near]
              Override any Expunge options from the config file. See below.

       {-n|-o|-u|-g|-f|-0|-F},
       {--new|--old|--upgrade|--gone|--flags|--noop|--full}

       {-L|-H}[n][o][u][g][f],
       {--pull|--push}[-new|-old|-upgrade|-gone|-flags]
              Override any Sync options from the config file. See below.

       -h, --help
              Display a summary of command line options.

       -v, --version
              Display version information.

       -y, --dry-run
              Enter simulation mode: the Channel status is queried and all
              required operations are determined, but no modifications are
              actually made to either the mailboxes or the state files.

       -e, --ext-exit
              Return an extended exit code: Add 32 or 64 to the code if any
              modifications were made on the far or near side, respectively;
              these are not mutually exclusive, so the code may be 96 if
              changes were both pushed and pulled.  An error may be reported
              at the same time, so the code may be for example 65 if some
              changes were successfully pulled, while others failed.

       -V, --verbose
              Enable verbose mode, which displays what is currently happening.

       -D[C][d|D][m][M][n|N][s]], --debug[-crash|-driver|-driver-
       all|-maildir|-main|-net|-net-all|-sync]
              Enable debugging categories:
                  C, crash - use built-in crash handler
                  d, driver - print driver calls (metadata only)
                  D, driver-all - print driver calls (including messages)
                  m, maildir - print maildir debug info
                  M, main - print main debug info
                  n, net - print network traffic (protocol only)
                  N, net-all - print network traffic (including payloads)
                  s, sync - print synchronization debug info
              All categories except crash implicitly enable verbose mode.
              Without category specification, all categories except net-all
              are enabled.

       -q, --quiet
              Suppress progress counters (this is implicit if stdout is no
              TTY, or any debugging categories are enabled), notices, and the
              summary.  If specified twice, suppress warning messages as well.

CONFIGURATION
       The configuration file is mandatory; mbsync will not run without it.
       Lines starting with a hash mark (#) are comments and are ignored
       entirely.  Configuration items are keywords followed by one or more
       arguments; arguments containing spaces must be enclosed in double
       quotes ("), and literal double quotes and backslashes (\) must be
       backslash-escaped.  All keywords (including those used as arguments)
       are case-insensitive.  Bash-like home directory expansion using the
       tilde (~) is supported in all options which represent local paths.  The
       reference point for relative local paths is the configuration file's
       containing directory.  There are a few global options, the others apply
       to particular sections.  Sections begin with a section-starting keyword
       and are terminated by an empty line or end of file.  Every section
       defines an object with an identifier unique within that object class.

       There are two basic object classes: Stores and Channels. A Store
       defines a collection of mailboxes; basically a folder, either local or
       remote.  A Channel connects two Stores, describing the way the two are
       synchronized.
       There are two auxiliary object classes: Accounts and Groups. An Account
       describes the connection part of network Stores, so server
       configurations can be shared between multiple Stores. A Group
       aggregates multiple Channels to save typing on the command line.

       File system locations (in particular, Path and Inbox) use the Store's
       internal path separators, which may be slashes, periods, etc., or even
       combinations thereof.
       Mailbox names, OTOH, always use canonical path separators, which are
       Unix-like forward slashes.

   All Stores
       These options can be used in all supported Store types.
       The term "opposite Store" refers to the other Store within a Channel.
       The special mailbox INBOX exists in every Store; its physical location
       in the file system is Store type specific.

       Path path
              The location of the Store in the (server's) file system.  If
              this is no absolute path, the reference point is Store type
              specific.  This string is prepended to the mailbox names
              addressed in this Store, but is not considered part of them;
              this is important for Patterns and Create in the Channels
              section.  Note that you must append a slash if you want to
              specify an entire directory.  (Default: none)

       MaxSize size[k|m][b]
              Messages larger than size will have only a small placeholder
              message propagated into this Store.  This is useful for avoiding
              downloading messages with large attachments unless they are
              actually needed.  To upgrade the placeholder to the full
              message, it must be flagged, and the Upgrade operation executed.
              Caveats: Setting a size limit on a Store you never read directly
              (which is typically the case for servers) is not recommended, as
              you may never notice that affected messages were not propagated
              to it.  Also, as flagging is (ab-)used to request an upgrade,
              changes to the message's flagging state will not be propagated
              in either direction until after the placeholder is upgraded.
              K and M can be appended to the size to specify KiBytes resp.
              MeBytes instead of bytes. B is accepted but superfluous.  If
              size is 0, the maximum message size is unlimited.  (Default: 0)

       MapInbox mailbox
              Create a virtual mailbox (relative to Path) which aliases the
              INBOX. Makes sense in conjunction with Patterns in the Channels
              section, though with a Maildir near side, you probably want to
              place Inbox under Path instead.  This virtual mailbox does not
              support subfolders.

       Flatten delim
              Flatten the hierarchy within this Store by substituting the
              canonical hierarchy delimiter / with delim.  This can be useful
              when the MUA used to access the Store provides suboptimal
              handling of hierarchical mailboxes, as is the case with Mutt.  A
              common choice for the delimiter is ..
              Note that flattened sub-folders of the INBOX always end up under
              Path, including the "INBOXdelim" prefix.

       Trash mailbox
              Specifies a mailbox (relative to Path) to copy deleted messages
              to prior to expunging.  See RECOMMENDATIONS and INHERENT
              PROBLEMS below.  (Default: none)

       TrashNewOnly yes|no
              When trashing, copy only not yet propagated messages. This makes
              sense if the opposite Store has a Trash as well (with
              TrashNewOnly no).  (Default: no)

       TrashRemoteNew yes|no
              When expunging the opposite Store, copy not yet propagated
              messages to this Store's Trash.  When using this, the opposite
              Store does not need an own Trash at all, yet all messages are
              archived.  (Default: no)

   Maildir Stores
       The reference point for relative Paths is the configuration file's
       containing directory.

       As mbsync needs UIDs, but no standardized UID storage scheme exists for
       Maildir, mbsync supports two schemes, each with its pros and cons.
       The native scheme is stolen from the latest Maildir patches to c-client
       and is therefore compatible with pine. The UID validity is stored in a
       file named .uidvalidity; the UIDs are encoded in the file names of the
       messages.
       The alternative scheme is based on the UID mapping used by isync
       versions 0.8 and 0.9.x. The invariant parts of the file names of the
       messages are used as keys into a Berkeley database named
       .isyncuidmap.db, which holds the UID validity as well.
       The native scheme is faster, more space efficient, endianness
       independent and "human readable", but will be disrupted if a message is
       copied from another mailbox without getting a new file name; this would
       result in duplicated UIDs sooner or later, which in turn results in a
       UID validity change, making synchronization fail.  The alternative
       scheme would fail if a MUA changed a message's file name in a part
       mbsync considers invariant; this would be interpreted as a message
       deletion and a new message, resulting in unnecessary traffic.
       Mutt is known to work fine with both schemes.
       Use mdconvert to convert mailboxes from one scheme to the other.

       MaildirStore name
              Define the Maildir Store name, opening a section for its
              parameters.

       AltMap yes|no
              Use the alternative UID storage scheme for mailboxes in this
              Store.  This does not affect mailboxes that do already have a
              UID storage scheme; use mdconvert to change it.  See
              RECOMMENDATIONS below.  (Default: no)

       Inbox path
              The location of the INBOX. This is not relative to Path, but it
              is allowed to place the INBOX inside the Path.  (Default:
              ~/Maildir)

       InfoDelimiter delim
              The character used to delimit the info field from a message's
              basename.  The Maildir standard defines this to be the colon,
              but this is incompatible with DOS/Windows file systems.
              (Default: the value of FieldDelimiter)

       SubFolders Verbatim|Maildir++|Legacy
              The on-disk folder naming style used for hierarchical mailboxes.
              This option has no effect when Flatten is used.
              Suppose mailboxes with the canonical paths top/sub/subsub and
              INBOX/sub/subsub, the styles will yield the following on-disk
              paths:
              Verbatim - Path/top/sub/subsub and Inbox/sub/subsub (this is the
              style you probably want to use)
              Maildir++ - Inbox/.top.sub.subsub and Inbox/..sub.subsub (this
              style is compatible with Courier and Dovecot - but note that the
              mailbox metadata format is not compatible).  Note that attempts
              to set Path are rejected in this mode.
              Legacy - Path/top/.sub/.subsub and Inbox/.sub/.subsub (this is
              mbsync's historical style)
              (Default: unset; will error out when sub-folders are
              encountered)

   IMAP4 Accounts
       IMAPAccount name
              Define the IMAP4 Account name, opening a section for its
              parameters.

       Host host
              Specify the DNS name or IP address of the IMAP server.
              If Tunnel is used, this setting is needed only if TLSType is not
              None and CertificateFile is not used, in which case the host
              name is used for certificate subject verification.

       Port port
              Specify the TCP port number of the IMAP server.  (Default: 143
              for IMAP, 993 for IMAPS)
              If Tunnel is used, this setting is ignored.

       Timeout timeout
              Specify the connect and data timeout for the IMAP server in
              seconds.  Zero means unlimited.  (Default: 20)

       User username
              Specify the login name on the IMAP server.

       UserCmd [+]command
              Specify a shell command to obtain a user rather than specifying
              a user directly. This allows you to script retrieving user
              names.
              The command must produce exactly one line on stdout; the
              trailing newline is optional.  Prepend + to the command to
              indicate that it produces TTY output (e.g., a prompt); failure
              to do so will merely produce messier output.  Remember to
              backslash-escape double quotes and backslashes embedded into the
              command.

       Pass password
              Specify the password for username on the IMAP server.  Note that
              this option is not required.  If neither a password nor a
              password command is specified in the configuration file, mbsync
              will prompt you for a password.

       PassCmd [+]command
              Specify a shell command to obtain a password rather than
              specifying a password directly. This allows you to use password
              files and agents.
              See UserCmd above for details.

       UseKeychain yes|no
              Whether to use the macOS Keychain to obtain the password.
              (Default: no)

              The necessary keychain item can be created this way:

                     security add-internet-password -r imap -s Host -a User -w
                     password [ -T /path/to/mbsync ]

       Tunnel command
              Specify a command to run to establish a connection rather than
              opening a TCP socket.  This allows you to run an IMAP session
              over an SSH tunnel, for example.

       AuthMechs type ...
              The list of acceptable authentication mechanisms.  In addition
              to the mechanisms listed in the SASL registry (link below), the
              legacy IMAP LOGIN mechanism is known.  The wildcard * represents
              all mechanisms that are deemed secure enough for the current
              TLSType setting.  The actually used mechanism is the most secure
              choice from the intersection of this list, the list supplied by
              the server, and the installed SASL modules.  (Default: *)

       TLSType {None|STARTTLS|IMAPS}
              Select the connection security/encryption method:
              None - no security.  This is the default when Tunnel is set, as
              tunnels are usually secure.
              STARTTLS - security is established via the STARTTLS extension
              after connecting the regular IMAP port 143. Most servers support
              this, so it is the default (unless a tunnel is used).
              IMAPS - security is established by starting TLS negotiation
              right after connecting the secure IMAP port 993.

       TLSVersions {+|-}{1.0|1.1|1.2|1.3} ...
              Add/remove the specified TLS versions to/from the set of
              acceptable choices.  Use old versions only when the server has
              problems with newer ones.  Note that new versions are
              automatically enabled as soon as OpenSSL supports them, even if
              mbsync does not recognize them yet.  (Default: All starting with
              1.2).

       SystemCertificates yes|no
              Whether the system's default CA (certificate authority)
              certificate store should be used to verify certificate trust
              chains. Disable this if you want to trust only hand-picked
              certificates.  (Default: yes)

       CertificateFile path
              File containing additional X.509 certificates used to verify
              server identities.  It may contain two types of certificates:

              Host   These certificates are matched only against the received
                     server certificate itself.  They are always trusted,
                     regardless of validity.  A typical use case would be
                     forcing acceptance of an expired certificate.
                     These certificates may be obtained using the mbsync-get-
                     cert tool; make sure to verify their fingerprints before
                     trusting them, or transfer them securely from the
                     server's network (if it can be trusted beyond the server
                     itself).

              CA     These certificates are used as trust anchors when
                     building the certificate chain for the received server
                     certificate.  They are used to supplant or supersede the
                     system's trust store, depending on the SystemCertificates
                     setting; it is not necessary and not recommended to
                     specify the system's trust store itself here.  The trust
                     chains are fully validated.

       ClientCertificate path
              File containing a client certificate to send to the server.
              ClientKey should also be specified.
              Note that client certificate verification is usually not
              required, so it is unlikely that you need this option.

       ClientKey path
              File containing the private key corresponding to
              ClientCertificate.

       CipherString string
              Specify OpenSSL cipher string for connections secured with TLS
              up to version 1.2 (but not 1.3 and above).  The format is
              described in ciphers(1).  (Default: empty, which implies system
              wide policy).

       PipelineDepth depth
              Maximum number of IMAP commands which can be simultaneously in
              flight.  Setting this to 1 disables pipelining.  This is mostly
              a debugging option, but may also be used to limit average
              bandwidth consumption (GMail may require this if you have a very
              fast connection), or to spare flaky servers like M$ Exchange.
              (Default: unlimited)

       DisableExtension[s] extension ...
              Disable the use of specific IMAP extensions.  This can be used
              to work around bugs in servers (and possibly mbsync itself).
              (Default: empty)

   IMAP Stores
       The reference point for relative Paths is whatever the server likes it
       to be; probably the user's $HOME or $HOME/Mail on that server. The
       location of INBOX is up to the server as well and is usually
       irrelevant.

       IMAPStore name
              Define the IMAP4 Store name, opening a section for its
              parameters.

       Account account
              Specify which IMAP4 Account to use. Instead of defining an
              Account and referencing it here, it is also possible to specify
              all the Account options directly in the Store's section - this
              makes sense if an Account is used for one Store only anyway.

       UseNamespace yes|no
              Selects whether the server's first "personal" NAMESPACE should
              be prefixed to mailbox names. Disabling this makes sense for
              some broken IMAP servers.  This option is meaningless if a Path
              was specified.  (Default: yes)

       PathDelimiter delim
              Specify the server's hierarchy delimiter.  (Default: taken from
              the server's first "personal" NAMESPACE)
              Do not abuse this to re-interpret the hierarchy.  Use Flatten
              instead.

       SubscribedOnly yes|no
              Selects whether to synchronize only mailboxes that are
              subscribed to on the IMAP server. In technical terms, if this
              option is set, mbsync will use the IMAP command LSUB instead of
              LIST to look for mailboxes in this Store.  This option make
              sense only in conjunction with Patterns.  (Default: no)

   Channels
       Channel name
              Define the Channel name, opening a section for its parameters.

       {Far|Near} :store:[mailbox]
              Specify the far resp. near side Store to be connected by this
              Channel.  If Patterns are specified, mailbox is interpreted as a
              prefix which is not matched against the patterns, and which is
              not affected by mailbox list overrides.  Otherwise, if mailbox
              is omitted, INBOX is assumed.

       Pattern[s] [!]pattern ...
              Instead of synchronizing only one mailbox pair, synchronize all
              mailboxes that match the pattern(s). The mailbox names are the
              same on the far and near side. Patterns are IMAP4 patterns,
              i.e., * matches anything and % matches anything up to the next
              hierarchy delimiter. Prepending ! to a pattern makes it an
              exclusion. Multiple patterns can be specified (either by
              supplying multiple arguments or by using Pattern multiple
              times); later matches take precedence.
              Note that INBOX is not matched by wildcards, unless it lives
              under Path.
              The mailbox list selected by Patterns can be overridden by a
              mailbox list in a Channel reference (a Group specification or
              the command line).
              Example: "Patterns %_!Trash"

       MaxSize size[k|m][b]
              Analogous to the homonymous option in the Stores section, but
              applies equally to Far and Near. Note that this actually
              modifies the Stores, so take care not to provide conflicting
              settings if you use the Stores in multiple Channels.

       MaxMessages count
              Sets the maximum number of messages to keep in each near side
              mailbox.  This is useful for mailboxes where you keep a complete
              archive on the server, but want to mirror only the last messages
              (for instance, for mailing lists).  The messages that were the
              first to arrive in the mailbox (independently of the actual date
              of the message) will be deleted first.  Messages that are
              flagged (marked as important) and (by default) unread messages
              will not be automatically deleted.  If count is 0, the maximum
              number of messages is unlimited (Global default: 0).

       ExpireUnread yes|no
              Selects whether unread messages should be affected by
              MaxMessages.  Normally, unread messages are considered important
              and thus never expired.  This ensures that you never miss new
              messages even after an extended absence.  However, if your
              archive contains large amounts of unread messages by design,
              treating them as important would practically defeat MaxMessages.
              In this case you need to enable this option.  (Global default:
              no).

       ExpireSide Far|Near
              Selects on which side messages should be expired when
              MaxMessages is configured.  (Global default: Near).

       Sync {None|[Pull] [Push] [New] [Old] [Upgrade] [Gone] [Flags] [Full]}
              Select the synchronization operation(s) to perform:
              Pull - propagate changes from far to near side.
              Push - propagate changes from near to far side.
              New - propagate newly appeared messages.
              Old - propagate previously skipped, failed, and expired
              messages.  This has a (relatively) high cost and may repeatedly
              produce error messages, so it always must be specified
              explicitly.
              Upgrade - upgrade placeholders to full messages. Useful only
              with a configured MaxSize.
              Gone - propagate message disappearances. This applies only to
              messages that are actually gone, i.e., were expunged. The
              affected messages in the opposite Store are marked as deleted
              only, i.e., they won't be really deleted until that Store is
              expunged.
              Flags - propagate flag changes. Note that Deleted/Trashed is a
              flag as well; this is particularly interesting if you use mutt
              with the maildir_trash option.
              Full - alias for "New Upgrade Gone Flags".  This is the global
              default.
              None (--noop on the command line) - don't propagate anything.
              Useful if you want to expunge only.

              Pull and Push are direction flags, while New, Old, Upgrade,
              Gone, and Flags are type flags.  The two flag classes make up a
              two-dimensional matrix (a table). Its cells are the individual
              actions to perform. There are two styles of asserting the cells:
              In the first style, the flags select entire rows/colums in the
              matrix. Only the cells which are selected both horizontally and
              vertically are asserted.  Specifying no direction is like
              specifying both directions, and specifying no type is like
              specifying Full.  For example, "Sync Pull New Flags" will
              propagate new messages and flag changes from the far side to the
              near side, "Sync New Gone" will propagate message arrivals and
              deletions both ways, and "Sync Push" will propagate all changes
              from the near side to the far side.
              In the second style, direction flags are concatenated with type
              flags; every compound flag immediately asserts a cell in the
              matrix. In addition to at least one compound flag, the
              individual flags can be used as well, but as opposed to the
              first style, they immediately assert all cells in their
              respective row/column (with the exception of Old). For example,
              "Sync PullNew PullGone Push" will propagate message arrivals and
              deletions from the far side to the near side and any changes
              (except old messages) from the near side to the far side.
              Note that it is not allowed to assert a cell in two ways, e.g.
              "Sync PullNew Pull" and "Sync PullNew Gone Push" induce error
              messages.
              None may not be combined with any other operation.

       Create {None|Far|Near|Both}
              Automatically create missing mailboxes [on the far/near side].
              Otherwise print an error message and skip that mailbox pair if a
              mailbox and the corresponding sync state does not exist.
              (Global default: None)

       Remove {None|Far|Near|Both}
              Propagate mailbox deletions [to the far/near side].  Otherwise
              print an error message and skip that mailbox pair if a mailbox
              does not exist but the corresponding sync state does.
              For MailDir mailboxes it is sufficient to delete the cur/
              subdirectory to mark them as deleted. This ensures compatibility
              with SyncState *.
              Note that for safety, non-empty mailboxes are never deleted.
              (Global default: None)

       Expunge {None|Far|Near|Both}
              Permanently remove all messages [on the far/near side] which are
              marked for deletion.  Mutually exclusive with ExpungeSolo for
              the same side.  See RECOMMENDATIONS below.  (Global default:
              None)

       ExpungeSolo {None|Far|Near|Both}
              Permanently remove all messages [on the far/near side] which are
              both marked for deletion and have no corresponding message in
              the opposite Store.  Together with Sync Gone, this allows actual
              mirroring of expunges. Note, however, that this makes sense only
              if nothing else expunges the other messages which are marked for
              deletion.  Also note that this does not work for IMAP Stores
              which do not support the UIDPLUS extension.  Mutually exclusive
              with Expunge for the same side.  (Global default: None)

       CopyArrivalDate {yes|no}
              Selects whether their arrival time should be propagated together
              with the messages.  Enabling this makes sense in order to keep
              the time stamp based message sorting intact.  Note that IMAP
              does not guarantee that the time stamp (termed internal date) is
              actually the arrival time, but it is usually close enough.
              (Global default: no)

       Sync, Create, Remove, Expunge, ExpungeSolo, MaxMessages, ExpireUnread,
       ExpireSide, and CopyArrivalDate can be used before any section for a
       global effect.  The global settings are overridden by Channel-specific
       options, which in turn are overridden by command line switches.

       SyncState {*|path}
              Set the location of this Channel's synchronization state files.
              * means that the state should be saved in a file named
              .mbsyncstate in the near side mailbox itself; this has the
              advantage that you do not need to handle the state file
              separately if you delete the mailbox, but it works only with
              Maildir mailboxes, obviously.  Otherwise this is interpreted as
              a string to prepend to the near side mailbox name to make up a
              complete path. Note that you must append a slash if you want to
              specify a directory.
              This option can be used outside any section for a global effect.
              In this case the appended string is made up according to the
              pattern :far-store:far-box_:near-store:near-box (see also
              FieldDelimiter below).
              (Global default: $XDG_STATE_HOME/isync/, with a fallback to
              ~/.mbsync/ if only that exists.  $XDG_STATE_HOME defaults to
              ~/.local/state if not set.)

   Groups
       Group name [channel[:box[,...]]] ...
              Define the Group name, opening a section for its parameters.
              Note that even though Groups have an own namespace, they will
              "hide" Channels with the same name on the command line.
              One or more Channels can be specified on the same line.
              If you supply one or more boxes to a channel, they will be used
              instead of what is specified in the Channel's Patterns.  The
              same can be done on the command line, except that there newlines
              can be used as mailbox name separators as well.

       Channel[s] channel[:box[,...]] ...
              Add the specified Channels to the Group. This option can be
              specified multiple times within a Group.

   Global Options
       FSync yes|no
              Selects whether mbsync performs forced flushing, which
              determines the level of data safety after system crashes and
              power outages.  Disabling it is reasonably safe for file systems
              which are mounted with data=ordered mode.  Enabling it is a wise
              choice for file systems mounted with data=writeback, in
              particular modern systems like ext4, btrfs and xfs. The
              performance impact on older file systems may be
              disproportionate.  (Default: yes)

       FieldDelimiter delim
              The character to use to delimit fields in the string appended to
              a global SyncState.  mbsync prefers to use the colon, but this
              is incompatible with DOS/Windows file systems.  This option is
              meaningless for SyncState if the latter is *, obviously.
              However, it also determines the default of InfoDelimiter.
              (Global default: ; on Windows, : everywhere else)

       BufferLimit size[k|m][b]
              The per-Channel, per-direction instantaneous memory usage above
              which mbsync will refrain from using more memory. Note that this
              is no absolute limit, as even a single message can consume more
              memory than this.  (Default: 10M)

CONSOLE OUTPUT
       If mbsync's output is connected to a console, it will print progress
       counters by default. The output will look like this:

           C: 1/2  B: 3/4  F: +13/13 *23/42 #0/0 -0/0  N: +0/7 *0/0 #0/0 -0/0

       This represents the cumulative progress over Channels, boxes, and
       messages affected on the far and near side, respectively.  The message
       counts represent added messages, messages with updated flags, trashed
       messages, and expunged messages, respectively.  No attempt is made to
       calculate the totals in advance, so they grow over time as more
       information is gathered.

       Irrespective of output redirection, mbsync will print a summary of the
       above upon completion, except in quiet mode.

RECOMMENDATIONS
       Make sure your IMAP server does not auto-expunge deleted messages - it
       is slow, and semantically somewhat questionable. Specifically, Gmail
       needs to be configured not to do it.

       By default, mbsync will not delete any messages - expunges are
       propagated by marking the messages as deleted in the opposite Store.
       Once you have verified that your setup works, you will typically want
       to set Expunge to Both, so that deletions become effective.

       mbsync's built-in trash functionality relies on mbsync doing the
       expunging of deleted messages. This is the case when it propagates
       deletions of previously propagated messages, and the trash is on the
       target Store (typically your IMAP server).
       However, when you intend mbsync to trash messages which were not
       propagated yet, the MUA must mark the messages as deleted without
       expunging them (e.g., Mutt's maildir_trash option). Note that most
       messages are propagated a long time before they are deleted, so this is
       a corner case you probably do not want to optimize for. This also
       implies that the TrashNewOnly and TrashRemoteNew options are typically
       not very useful.

       If your server supports auto-trashing (as Gmail does), it is probably a
       good idea to rely on that instead of mbsync's trash functionality.  If
       you do that, and intend to synchronize the trash like other mailboxes,
       you should not use mbsync's Trash option at all.

       Use of the Trash option with M$ Exchange 2013 requires the use of
       DisableExtension MOVE due to a server bug.

       When using the more efficient default UID mapping scheme, it is
       important that the MUA renames files when moving them between Maildir
       folders.  Mutt always does that, while mu4e needs to be configured to
       do it:
           (setq mu4e-change-filenames-when-moving t)
       The general expectation is that a completely new filename is generated
       as if the message was new, but stripping the ,U=xxx infix is sufficient
       as well.

INHERENT PROBLEMS
       Changes done after mbsync has retrieved the message list will not be
       synchronised until the next time mbsync is invoked.

       Using Trash on IMAP Stores without the UIDPLUS extension (notably, M$
       Exchange up to at least 2010) bears a race condition: messages will be
       lost if they are marked as deleted after the message list was retrieved
       but before the mailbox is expunged.  There is no risk as long as the
       IMAP mailbox is accessed by only one client (including mbsync) at a
       time.
