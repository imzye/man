NAME
       nss_ndb.conf - BerkeleyDB nsswitch backend configuration file


DESCRIPTION
       The nss_ndb.conf configuration file can be used to specify certain
       options for the nss_ndb backend for the nsswitch.

       Please note that the use of this configuration file by default is not
       enabled and must explicitly be enabled when building the nss_ndb
       package. You can check if nss_ndb was built with support for a
       configuration file (and find the location of it) with the following
       command:

              $ strings /usr/lib/nss_ndb.so.1 | fgrep nss_ndb.conf


CONFIGURATION
       The configuration file is using a simple "option value" format.  Lines
       beginning with '#' and empty lines are ignored. The following options
       may be set in the file:

       workgroup   [ workgroup ]

       Configure a "windows" (WORKGROUP\name) workgroup to strip from user &
       group names before looking them up in the database (ADsername)

       realm       [ realm ]

       Configure a "realm" (name@realm) to strip from user & group names
       before looking them up in the database (ADsername)

       debug       level

       Increase internal debugging verbosity. Not really useful for normal
       users.
