Parse::HTTP::UserAgent(3)                  User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Parse::HTTP::UserAgent

VERSION
       version 0.43

SYNOPSIS
          use Parse::HTTP::UserAgent;
          my $ua = Parse::HTTP::UserAgent->new( $str );
          die "Unable to parse!" if $ua->unknown;
          print $ua->name;
          print $ua->version;
          print $ua->os;
          # or just dump for debugging:
          print $ua->dumper;

DESCRIPTION
       Quoting <http://www.webaim.org/blog/user-agent-string-history/>:

          " ... and then Google built Chrome, and Chrome used Webkit, and it was like
          Safari, and wanted pages built for Safari, and so pretended to be Safari.
          And thus Chrome used WebKit, and pretended to be Safari, and WebKit pretended
          to be KHTML, and KHTML pretended to be Gecko, and all browsers pretended to
          be Mozilla, (...) , and the user agent string was a complete mess, and near
          useless, and everyone pretended to be everyone else, and confusion
          abounded."

       User agent strings are a complete mess since there is no standard
       format for them. They can be in various formats and can include more or
       less information depending on the vendor's (or the user's) choice.
       Also, it is not dependable since it is some arbitrary identification
       string. Any user agent can fake another. So, why deal with such a
       useless mess? You may want to see the choice of your visitors and can
       get some reliable data (even if some are fake) and generate some nice
       charts out of them or just want to send an "HttpOnly" cookie if the
       user agent seems to support it (and send a normal one if this is not
       the case). However, browser sniffing for client-side coding is
       considered a bad habit.

       This module implements a rules-based parser and tries to identify MSIE,
       FireFox, Opera, Safari & Chrome first. It then tries to identify
       Mozilla, Netscape, Robots and the rest will be tried with a generic
       parser. There is also a structure dumper, useful for debugging.

NAME
       Parse::HTTP::UserAgent - Parser for the User Agent string

DEPRECATION NOTICE
       This module is DEPRECATED. Please use HTTP::BrowserDetect instead.

METHODS
   new STRING [, OPTIONS ]
       Constructor. Takes the user agent string as the first parameter and
       returns an object based on the parsed structure.

       The optional "OPTIONS" parameter (must be a hashref) can be used to
       pass several parameters:

       •   "extended": controls if the extended probe will be used or not.
           Default is true. Set this to false to disable:

              $ua = Parse::HTTP::UserAgent->new( $str, { extended => 0 } );

           Can be used to speed up the parser by disabling detection of non-
           major browsers, robots and most mobile agents.

   trim STRING
       Trims the string.

   as_hash
       Returns a hash representation of the parsed structure.

   dumper
       See Parse::HTTP::UserAgent::Base::Dumper.

   accessors
       See Parse::HTTP::UserAgent::Base::Accessors for the available accessors
       you can use on the parsed object.

OVERLOADED INTERFACE
       The object returned, overloads stringification ("name") and
       numification ("version") operators. So that you can write this:

           print 42 if $ua eq 'Opera' && $ua >= 9;

       instead of this

           print 42 if $ua->name eq 'Opera' && $ua->version >= 9;

ERROR HANDLING
       •   If you pass a false value to the constructor, it'll croak.

       •   If you pass a non-hashref option to the constructor, it'll croak.

       •   If you pass a wrong parameter to the dumper, it'll croak.

SEE ALSO
       This module is DEPRECATED. Please use HTTP::BrowserDetect instead.
