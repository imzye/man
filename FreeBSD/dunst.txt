NAME
       dunst - a customizable and lightweight notification-daemon

SYNOPSIS
       dunst [-conf file] [-verbosity v] [-print] [--startup_notification]

DESCRIPTION
       Dunst is a highly configurable and lightweight notification daemon.

   Autostarting dunst
       On most installations, dunst should be able to automatically be started
       by D-Bus when a notification is sent. This is not recommended when
       multiple notification daemons are installed, because D-Bus will not
       know which one to start.  Other ways of autostarting dunst include
       starting dunst with your desktop environment or window manager's
       autostart functionality or via the provided systemd service.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
       -h/-help/--help
           List all command line flags

       -conf/-config file
           Use alternative config file.  This disables the search for other
           config files.  If it cannot be opened, dunst will issue a warning
           and fall back on its internal defaults.  (Hint: `dunst -conf -
           </dev/null` can be used to enforce the defaults, i.e. for testing)

       -v/-version/--version
           Print version information.

       -verbosity (values: 'crit', 'warn', 'mesg', 'info', 'debug' default
       'mesg')
           Do not display log messages, which have lower precedence than
           specified verbosity. This won't affect printing notifications on
           the terminal. Use the '-print' option for this.

       -print/--print
           Print notifications to stdout. This might be useful for logging,
           setting up rules or using the output in other scripts.

       -startup_notification/--startup_notification
           Display a notification on startup.

   DEPRECATED OPTIONS
       Old version of dunst allowed changing the colors of different urgencies
       through command line options. This has been long removed in favour of
       RULES, see issue #328.

       -li/ni/ci icon
           Set notification icon.

       -lf/nf/cf color
           Set notification foreground color.

       -lb/nb/cb color
           Set notification background color.

       -lh/nh/ch color
           Set notification highlight color.

       -lfr/nfr/cfr color
           Set notification frame color.

       -lto/nto/cto secs
           Set notification timeout time.

CONFIGURATION
       A default configuration file is included (usually
       /usr/local/etc/dunst/dunstrc) and serves as the least important
       configuration file. Note: this was previously
       /usr/local/share/dunst/dunstrc. You can edit this file to change the
       system-wide defaults or copy it to a more important location to
       override its settings. See the FILES section for more details on where
       dunst searches for its configuration files and how settings get
       applied.

       See dunst(5) for all possible settings.

   NOTIFY-SEND HINTS
       Dunst is able to get different colors for a message via notify-send.
       In order to do that you have to add a hint via the -h option.  The
       progress value can be set with a hint, too.

       See dunst(5) for the list of accepted hints.

       Some examples:

               notify-send -h string:fgcolor:#ff4444

               notify-send -h string:bgcolor:#4444ff -h string:fgcolor:#ff4444 -h string:frcolor:#44ff44

               notify-send -h int:value:42 "Working ..."

MISCELLANEOUS
       Dunst can be paused via the `dunstctl set-paused true` command. To
       unpause dunst use `dunstctl set-paused false`.  Another way is to send
       SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 to pause and unpause respectively. Pausing using
       dunstctl is recommended over using signals, because the meaning of the
       signals isn't stable and might change in the future.

       When paused, dunst won't display any notifications, but keeps all
       notifications in a queue. This can for example be wrapped around a
       screen locker (i3lock, slock) to prevent flickering of notifications
       through the lock, and to read all missed notifications after returning
       to the computer.

FILES
       These are the base directories dunst searches for configuration files
       in descending order of importance:

       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME
               This is the most important directory. ("$HOME/.config" if unset
               or empty)

       $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS
               This, like $PATH for instance, is a :-separated list of base
               directories in descending order of importance.  (/usr/local/etc
               if unset or empty)

       Dunst will search these directories for the following relative file
       paths:

       dunst/dunstrc
               This is the base config and as such the least important in a
               particular base directory.

       dunst/dunstrc.d/*.conf
               These are "drop-ins" (mind the ".d" suffix of the directory).
               They are more important than the base dunstrc in the parent
               directory, as they are considered to be small snippets to
               override settings.  The last in lexical order is the most
               important one, so you can easily change the order by renaming
               them.  A common approach to naming drop-ins is to prefix them
               with numbers, i.e.:

                   00-least-important.conf
                   01-foo.conf
                   20-bar.conf
                   99-most-important.conf

               Only files with the .conf suffix will be read.

       Only settings from the last base config the corresponding drop-ins get
       applied.  So if a dunstrc is first found in ~/.config/dunst/dunstrc,
       drop-ins will be searched in ~/.config/dunst/dunstrc.d/*. Settings in
       more important files override those in less important ones.
