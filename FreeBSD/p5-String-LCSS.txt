NAME
       String::LCSS - Find The Longest Common Substring of Two Strings.

VERSION
       This document refers to String::LCSS version 1.00.

SYNOPSIS
           use String::LCSS;
           my $longest = lcss( "zyzxx", "abczyzefg" );
           print $longest, "\n";

           my @result = lcss( "zyzxx", "abczyzefg" );
           print "$result[0] ($result[1],$result[2])\n";

DESCRIPTION
       String::LCSS provides the function "lcss" to ferret out the longest
       common substring shared by two strings passed as arguments.

SUBROUTINES
       lcss($string1, $string2)
           "undef" is returned if the susbstring length is one char or less.

           In scalar context, returns the substring.

           When used in an array context, "lcss" will return the indexi of the
           match root in the two args.

EXPORT
       The "lcss" function is exported by default.
