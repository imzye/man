LINSYSFS(5)               FreeBSD File Formats Manual              LINSYSFS(5)

NAME
     linsysfs – Linux kernel objects file system

SYNOPSIS
     linsys          /compat/linux/sys       linsysfs        rw 0 0

DESCRIPTION
     The Linux system file system, or linsysfs, emulates a subset of the Linux
     sys file system and is required for the complete operation of some Linux
     binaries.

     The linsysfs provides a two-level view of devices.  At the highest level,
     PCI devices themselves are named, according to their bus, slot and
     function in the system hierarchy.  PCI storage devices are listed in the
     scsi_host class with a device symlink to the PCI directories of the
     devices.

     Each device node is a directory containing some files and directories:

     host        A place holder for storage host information.

     pci_id      A directory for the pci_id that contains either the device
                 information or another directory structure for a PCI bridge.

     Each host node of scsi_host is a directory containing some files and
     directories:

     proc_name      The Linux registered driver name for these devices.

     device         A symlink to the PCI device directory.

FILES
     /compat/linux/sys                         The normal mount point for
                                               linsysfs.
     /compat/linux/sys/class/scsi_host         The storage host node.
     /compat/linux/sys/devices/pci0000:00      The PCI device hierarchy node.

EXAMPLES
     The most common usage follows:

           mount -t linsysfs linsys /compat/linux/sys

     where /compat/linux/sys is a mount point.
