ZFS-JAIL(8)             FreeBSD System Manager's Manual            ZFS-JAIL(8)

NAME
     zfs-jail – attach or detach ZFS filesystem from FreeBSD jail

SYNOPSIS
     zfs jail jailid|jailname filesystem
     zfs unjail jailid|jailname filesystem

DESCRIPTION
     zfs jail jailid|jailname filesystem
       Attach the specified filesystem to the jail identified by JID jailid or
       name jailname.  From now on this file system tree can be managed from
       within a jail if the jailed property has been set.  To use this
       functionality, the jail needs the allow.mount and allow.mount.zfs
       parameters set to 1 and the enforce_statfs parameter set to a value
       lower than 2.

       You cannot attach a jailed dataset's children to another jail.  You can
       also not attach the root file system of the jail or any dataset which
       needs to be mounted before the zfs rc script is run inside the jail, as
       it would be attached unmounted until it is mounted from the rc script
       inside the jail.

       To allow management of the dataset from within a jail, the jailed
       property has to be set and the jail needs access to the /dev/zfs
       device.  The quota property cannot be changed from within a jail.

       After a dataset is attached to a jail and the jailed property is set, a
       jailed file system cannot be mounted outside the jail, since the jail
       administrator might have set the mount point to an unacceptable value.

       See jail(8) for more information on managing jails.  Jails are a
       FreeBSD feature and are not relevant on other platforms.

     zfs unjail jailid|jailname filesystem
       Detaches the specified filesystem from the jail identified by JID
       jailid or name jailname.
