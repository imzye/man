NAME
       "Net::BGP" - Border Gateway Protocol version 4 speaker/listener library

SYNOPSIS
           use Net::BGP::Process;
           use Net::BGP::Peer;

           $bgp  = Net::BGP::Process->new();
           $peer = Net::BGP::Peer->new(
               Start    => 1,
               ThisID   => '10.0.0.1',
               ThisAS   => 64512,
               PeerID   => '10.0.0.2',
               PeerAS   => 64513
           );

           $bgp->add_peer($peer);
           $peer->add_timer(\&my_timer_callback, 60);
           $bgp->event_loop();

DESCRIPTION
       This module is an implementation of the BGP-4 inter-domain routing
       protocol.  It encapsulates all of the functionality needed to establish
       and maintain a BGP peering session and exchange routing update
       information with the peer.  It aims to provide a simple API to the BGP
       protocol for the purposes of automation, logging, monitoring, testing,
       and similar tasks using the power and flexibility of perl. The module
       does not implement the functionality of a RIB (Routing Information
       Base) nor does it modify the kernel routing table of the host system.
       However, such operations could be implemented using the API provided by
       the module.

       The module takes an object-oriented approach to abstracting the
       operations of the BGP protocol. It supports multiple peering sessions
       and each peer corresponds to one instance of a Net::BGP::Peer object.
       The details of maintaining each peering session are handled and
       coordinated by an instance of a Net::BGP::Process object. BGP UPDATE
       messages and the routing information they represent are encapsulated by
       Net::BGP::Update objects.  Whenever protocol errors occur and a BGP
       NOTIFICATION is sent or received, programs can determine the details of
       the error via Net::BGP::Notification objects.

       The module interacts with client programs through the paradigm of
       callback functions. Whenever interesting protocol events occur, a
       callback function supplied by the user is called and information
       pertaining to the event is passed to the function for examination or
       action. For instance, whenever an UPDATE message is received from a
       peer, the module handles the details of decoding the message,
       validating it, and encapsulating it in an object and passing the object
       to the specific callback function supplied by the user for UPDATE
       message handling. The callback function is free to do whatever with the
       object - it might send a Net::BGP::Update object to other peers as
       UPDATE messages, perhaps after modifying some of the UPDATE attributes,
       log the routing information to a file, or do nothing at all. The
       possibilities for implementing routing policy via such a mechanism are
       limited only by the expressive capabilities of the perl language. It
       should be noted however that the module is intended for the uses stated
       above and probably would not scale well for very large BGP meshes or
       routing tables.

       The module must maintain periodic protocol keep-alive and other
       processes, so once control is passed to the module's main event loop,
       control flow only passes back to user code whenever one of the callback
       functions is invoked. To provide more interaction with user programs,
       the module allows user timers to be established and called periodically
       to perform further processing. Multiple timers may be established, and
       each is associated with a single peer. Whenever the timers expire, a
       user supplied function is called and the timer is reset. The timer
       callback functions can perform whatever actions are necessary - sending
       UPDATEs, modifying the state of the peering session, house-keeping,
       etc.

BUGS
       The connection collision resolution code is broken. As currently
       implemented, whenever a connection is received from a peer, the
       Net::BGP::Peer object is cloned and each peer object proceeds through
       the session establishment process until the collision resolution
       procedure is reached. At this point, if the cloned object is chosen by
       the collison resolution procedure, the original peer object is
       destroyed, leaving the cloned object. Unfortunately, a user program
       will only have a reference to the original peer object it created and
       will have no way of accessing the cloned object. It is therefore
       recommended that Net::BGP::Peer objects be instantiated with the Listen
       parameter set to a false value. This prevents the peer object from
       receiving connections from its BGP peer, although it will continue
       actively attempting to establish sessions. This problem will be
       addressed in a future revision of "Net::BGP".

       As an initial revision, the code has not been subjected to a thorough
       security audit. It is possible and likely that exploitable code exists
       in the packet decoding routines. Therefore, it is recommended that the
       module only be used to establish peering sessions with trusted peers,
       particularly if programs using the module will be run with root
       priviliges (which is necessary if programs want to modify the kernel
       routing table or bind to the well-known BGP port 179).
