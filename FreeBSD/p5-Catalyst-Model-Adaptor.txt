Catalyst::Helper::Model::Adaptor(3)        User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Catalyst::Helper::Model::Adaptor - helper for the incredibly lazy

SYNOPSIS
       Running:

           ./script/myapp_create.pl model SomeClass Adaptor MyApp::Backend::SomeClass create

       Will create "YourApp::Model::SomeClass" that looks like:

           package YourApp::Model::SomeClass;
           use strict;
           use warnings;
           use base 'Catalyst::Model::Adaptor';

           __PACKAGE__->config(
               class       => 'MyApp::Backend::SomeClass',
               constructor => 'create',
           );

           1;

       Why you need a script to generate that is beyond me, but here it is.

ARGUMENTS
          ./script/myapp_create.pl model <model_name> Adaptor <class> [<constructor>]

       You need to sepecify the "model_name" (the name of the model), and
       "class", the class being adapted.  If "$class->new" isn't going to do
       what you want, pass the name of $class's constructor as "constructor".
