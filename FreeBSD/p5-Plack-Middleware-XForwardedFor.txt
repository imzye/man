SYNOPSIS
         builder {
           enable "Plack::Middleware::XForwardedFor",
             trust => [qw(127.0.0.1/8)];
         };

DESCRIPTION
       "Plack::Middleware::XForwardedFor" will look for "X-Forwarded-For"
       header in the incoming request and change "REMOTE_ADDR" to the real
       client IP

PARAMETERS
       trust
           If not specified then all addressed are trusted and "REMOTE_ADDR"
           will be set to the first IP in the "X-Forwarded-For" header.

           If given, it should be a list of IPs or Netmasks that can be
           trusted. Starting with the IP of the client in "REMOTE_ADDR" then
           the IPs in the "X-Forwarded-For" header from right to left.  The
           first untrusted IP found is set to be "REMOTE_ADDR"
