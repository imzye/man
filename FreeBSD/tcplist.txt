tcplist(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             tcplist(1)

tcplist
       tcplist - list tcp connections to/from this machine

SYNOPSIS
       tcplist [ -n ] [ -N ] [ -T ] [ -s ] [ -v ] [ -V ] [ -f filename ] [ -t
       timeout ]

DESCRIPTION
       Tcplist lists all the TCP connections to or from the machine it is run
       on. If any of the remote machines are running Ident-compilant servers,
       this is queried, and the results listed for each connection. Output is
       by default in "user@address:portnum user@address:portnum" format.

       Ident queries are done using non-blocking I/O, for performance.

OPTIONS
       -T     Report results in tabular format, with header. This format is
              probably easier to read, but harder to parse.

       -n     Don't resolve hostnames, but use host IP addresses instead.

       -N     Don't resolve port names. Use port numbers instead.

       -s     Show TCP servers running on this machine as well as established
              connections.

       -v     Verbose mode: give a running commentary of what is being done.

       -V     Print version information and exit.

       -f filename
              Assume the hosts listed in the specified file are not running
              Ident servers, and should not be queried. Listing terminal
              servers, X terminals, PC's, and similar machines in this file
              can significantly speed up tcplist in some environments.

       -t timeout
              Use the specified timeout for Ident queries. The default timeout
              is 30 seconds.

BUGS
       The kernel's tables can change while tcplist is examining them,
       creating incorrect or partial displays.

       Excessively long strings returned by Ident servers may be truncated.

       If an Ident server doesn't respond within the timeout, it is presumed
       to be down.  If the machine is very slow, remote, or congested, it may
       in fact be up.  The shorter the timeout, the more likely this will be.
