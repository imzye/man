NAME
       opencpn - Chartplotter and GPS Navigation Software

SYNOPSIS
       opencpn [options]

DESCRIPTION
       OpenCPN is a chartplotter and navigation GUI program supporting
       navigation under way as well as planning. It supports a wide range of
       chart formats using a plugin system. Other plugins provides support for
       e. g. radar, AIS and weather maps. Program is localized in 20+
       languages and ported to several OS including MacOS, Windows and Linux.


OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Show help info.

       -p     Run in portable mode.

       -l, --loglevel=<level>
              Set amount of logged information. Level is any of trace, debug,
              info, message, warning or error, defaulting to info if not set
              in environment; see ENVIRONMENT.


       -fullscreen
              Switch to full screen mode on start.

       -no_opengl
              Disable OpenGL video acceleration. This setting will be
              remembered.

       -rebuild_gl_raster_cache
              Rebuild OpenGL raster cache on start.

       -parse_all_enc
              Convert all S-57 charts to OpenCPN's internal format on start.

       -unit_test_1:<num>
              Display a slideshow of <num> charts and then exit. Zero or
              negative <num> specifies no limit.


PLUGIN LOADING
       Plugin loading depends on that the opencpn main program can locate the
       plugin object file and that the plugin can locate it's own data.

       On Linux, the main program searches for plugin .so-files in a library
       named opencpn/plugins.  By default, this path is searched in
       ~/.local/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib.  The default search path can be
       overridden by the OPENCPN_PLUGIN_DIRS environment variable.

       On other platforms, all plugin object files lives in a single directory
       defined at installation.

       A plugin's data directory is a path ending with
       opencpn/plugins/<plugin_name>.  On Linux, this is by default searched
       in ~/local/share:/usr/local/share:/usr/share.  This search path is
       overridden by XDG_DATA_DIRS as defined by the freedesktop spec.  Only
       plugins adapted for this (i. e., using GetPluginDataDir()) handles this
       properly.

       On other platforms, the plugin data directories always lives in a
       common parent defined at installation time.


LIBRARY LOADING AND LD_LIBRARY_PATH
       If LD_LIBRARY_PATH exists in the environment opencpn uses it without
       modifications.

       Otherwise LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set to the same path as from which plugins
       are loaded, see above. This ensures that helper binaries can load
       possible libraries installed in the same directories as the plugin.


ENVIRONMENT
       OPENCPN_PLUGIN_DIRS
              Plugin load path, see PLUGIN LOADING

       OPENCPN_LOGLEVEL
              Default loglevel if not defined on command line using
              -l/--loglevel. See the --loglevel option for allowed values.

       OPENCPN_FATAL_ERROR
              If defined, displays the message and exits on startup.


FILES
       ~/.opencpn/opencpn.log
              System log file, a useful tool to solve problems.



NOTES
       The support for OPENCPN_PLUGIN_DIRS and XDG_DATA_DIRS was introduced in
       version 5.0.0. Prior to this, all plugins was loaded from a single
       directory and all plugin data directories had a common parent.
