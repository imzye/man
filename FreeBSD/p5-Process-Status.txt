Process::Status(3)    User Contributed Perl Documentation   Process::Status(3)


NAME
       Process::Status - a handle on process termination, like $?

VERSION
       version 0.010

OVERVIEW
       When you run a system command with "system" or "qx``" or a number of
       other mechanisms, the process termination status gets put into $? as an
       integer.  In C, it's just an integer, and it stores a few pieces of
       data in different bits.

       Process::Status just provides a few simple methods to make it easier to
       inspect.  It exists almost entirely to provide "as_struct" and
       "as_string", which provide a simple decomposition of $?.

       Methods called on "Process::Status" without first calling a constructor
       will work on an implicitly-constructed object using the current value
       of $?.  To get an object for a specific value, you can call "new" and
       pass an integer.  You can also call "new" with no arguments to get an
       object for the current value of $?, if you want to keep that ugly
       variable out of your code.

PERL VERSION
       This library should run on perls released even an extremely long time
       ago.  It should work on any version of perl released in the last ten
       years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made
       that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version
       may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

METHODS
   new
         my $ps = Process::Status->new( $status );
         my $ps = Process::Status->new; # acts as if you'd passed $?

   status_code
       This returns the value of the integer return value, as you might have
       found in $?.

   is_success
       This method returns true if the status code is zero.

   exitstatus
       This method returns the exit status encoded in the status.  In other
       words, it's the number in the top eight bits.

   signal
       This returns the signal caught by the process, or zero.

   cored
       This method returns true if the process dumped core.

   as_struct
       This method returns a hashref describing the status.  Its exact
       contents may change over time; it is meant for human, not computer,
       consumption.

   as_string
       This method returns a string describing the status.  Its exact contents
       may change over time; it is meant for human, not computer, consumption.

       Roughly, you might get things like this:

         exited 0
         exited 92
         exited 2, caught SIGDERP
         exited 2, caught SIGSEGV; dumped core

   assert_ok
         Process::Status->assert_ok($program_name);

       This method does nothing if $? is 0.  Otherwise, it croaks with a
       message like:

         your-program-name exited 13, caught SIGNES

       If a program name is not provided, "program" is used.
