NAME
       cwdaemon - morse daemon for the serial or parallel port


SYNOPSIS
       cwdaemon [options]


DESCRIPTION
       Cwdaemon is a small daemon which uses the pc parallel or serial port
       and a simple transistor switch to output morse code to a transmitter
       from a text message sent to it via udp port 6789.


OPTIONS
       cwdaemon can be configured either through command line arguments on
       start of the daemon, or through requests (escaped requests) sent over
       network. Each escaped request starts with ASCII Escape character
       (decimal 27, hex 1B). The Escape character is represented in the list
       below by "<ESC>" string. Notice that there are no space characters
       between parts of escaped requests.

       Some of the arguments and requests require passing a value (e.g. Morse
       speed [wpm], tone (frequency) [Hz] etc.). Call "cwdaemon -h" to see
       default values for these arguments/requests, and ranges of accepted
       values.

       When handling command line arguments, cwdaemon does not accept invalid,
       malformed, or out-of-range values passed through command line. It won't
       attempt to guess caller's intentions, it won't try to start with some
       fallback value of the argument. Instead it will just print a debug
       message and exit. Rejection of bad values and exiting will happen
       before attempting to fork.

       When handling escaped requests, cwdaemon usually does not accept
       invalid, malformed or out-of-range vales either. But instead of exiting
       upon receiving request with such value, it simply prints debug message,
       ignores the request containing such value, and waits for next request.
       One exception to the rule is PTT delay: requested delay values that are
       too large will be clipped to maximal allowed value and then will be
       used by cwdaemon. Requested negative or malformed values of PTT delay
       will be ignored.



       Print help text to stdout and exit

              Command line argument: -h, --help


              Escaped request: N/A




       Print version information to stdout and exit

              Command line argument: -V, --version


              Escaped request: N/A




       Set hardware keying device

              Command line argument: -d, --cwdevice <device>


              Escaped request: <ESC>8<device>


              See chapter "DEVICES" below for more information.




       Don't fork daemon, run in foreground

              Command line argument: -n, --nofork


              Escaped request: N/A


              Debug information will be printed to stdout (unless different
              debug outut is selected, or debug output is silenced by setting
              debug output verbosity).




       Set network UDP port

              Command line argument: -p, --port <port number>


              Escaped request: <ESC>9<port number>


              This escaped request is obsolete and has no effect. Command line
              argument works as expected.




       Set process priority (niceness)

              Command line argument: -P, --priority <priority>


              Escaped request: N/A




       Set Morse speed [wpm]

              Command line argument: -s, --wpm <speed>


              Escaped request: <ESC>2<speed>




       Set PTT delay [ms] (TOD, Turn On Delay)

              Command line argument: -t, --pttdelay <delay>


              Escaped request: <ESC>d<delay>




       Turn PTT keying on/off

              Command line argument: N/A


              Escaped request: <ESC>a<{0|1}>


              0 - PTT off, 1 - PTT on




       Set sound system (sound backend)

              Command line argument: -x, --system <system>


              Escaped request: <ESC>f<system>


              See chapter "SOUND SYSTEM" below for more information.




       Set sound volume for soundcard [%]

              Command line argument: -v, --volume <volume>


              Escaped request: <ESC>g<volume>




       Set Morse weighting

              Command line argument: -w, --weighting <weighting>


              Escaped request: <ESC>7<weighting>




       Set tone (frequency) of sound [Hz]

              Command line argument: -T, --tone <tone>


              Escaped request: <ESC>3<tone>


              Notice that sending escaped request with value '0' silences
              cwdaemon.



       Increase verbosity of debug output

              Command line argument: -i


              Escaped request: N/A


              The argument can be repeated up to four times (-iiii) to
              gradually increase the verbosity.  Alternatively you can use
              -y/--verbosity option.




       Set verbosity threshold for debug strings

              Command line argument: -y, --verbosity <threshold>


              Escaped request: N/A


              Alternatively you can use -i option.


              See chapter "DEBUGGING" below for more information.






       Set numeric value of libcw debug flags

              Command line argument: -I, --libcwflags <flags>


              Escaped request: N/A




       Set debug output

              Command line argument: -f, --debugfile <output>


              Escaped request: N/A


              Print debug information to <output> instead of stdout.  Value of
              <output> can be explicitly stated as "stdout" (when not
              forking).  Value of <output> can be also "stderr" (when not
              forking).  Special value of <output> being "syslog" is reserved
              for future use. For now it will be rejected as invalid.  Passing
              path to disc file as value of <output> works in both situations:
              when forking and when not forking.





       Reset some of cwdaemon parameters

              Command line argument: N/A


              Escaped request: <ESC>0


              The request resets program's parameters to cwdaemon default
              values, unless the defaults were overridden with command line
              arguments - then the values passed in command line are used.



       Abort currently sent message

              Command line argument: N/A


              Escaped request: <ESC>4




       Exit (close) daemon

              Command line argument: N/A


              Escaped request: <ESC>5





       Set word mode

              Command line argument: N/A


              Escaped request: <ESC>6




       Set SSB way

              Command line argument: N/A


              Escaped request: <ESC>b<{0|1}


              0 - microphone, 1 - soundcard




       Tune for a number of seconds

              Command line argument: N/A


              Escaped request: <ESC>c<seconds>


              Tune for <seconds> seconds. The tuning is performed by both
              selected sound system, and by current hardware keying device.




       Set band switch output

              Command line argument: N/A


              Escaped request: <ESC>e<value>


              This argument sets band switch output on parport bits 9 (MSB),
              8, 7, 2 (LSB).





DEVICES
       Any serial device that supports getting and setting the modem control
       lines can be used.  On Linux, ttyS0, ttyS1, etc. will work.  On FreeBSD
       these devices are known as ttyd0, ttyd1, etc.  On OpenBSD, these same
       devices are known as tty00, tty01, etc., but may vary with platform.

       For parallel ports on Linux try parport0 (default) or parport1, and on
       FreeBSD, ppi0 (default), ppi1, etc.  OpenBSD does not support parallel
       port operation, and defaults to 'tty00'.

       For completeness, a dummy 'null' device is provided.  This device does
       exactly nothing (no rig keying, no ssb keying, etc.).




SOUND SYSTEM
       ´sound system´ should be one of following:

       ´c´ - console buzzer (PC speaker) - default system,

       ´o´ - OSS,

       ´a´ - ALSA,

       ´p´ - PulseAudio,

       ´n´ - none - no audio,

       ´s´ - soundcard - autoselect from OSS/ALSA/PulseAudio.




DEBUGGING
       cwdaemon can print debug strings. Each debug string in cwdaemon has
       specified verbosity (verbosity level), and can be printed (or not)
       depending on current verbosity threshold specified for cwdaemon.  The
       verbosity level value for each string can be changed in future versions
       of cwdaemon. Don't depend on current setup.

       The verbosity threshold can be specified through command line
       arguments: -i, -y, or --verbosity. -y and --verbosity accept
       "threshold" value (single character) as specified below:


       ´n´ - none

       ´e´ - errors

       ´w´ - warnings (default)

       ´i´ - information

       ´d´ - details


       By default the threshold is set to "warnings" - cwdaemon will print all
       errors and warnings. Changing the threshold to "information" will make
       the cwdaemon print errors, warnings, and information.


       Debug strings can be printed to stdout, stderr, or disc file. Printing
       to stdout or stderr is available only if cwdaemon has not forked.
       Printing to disc file is available regardless of whether cwdaemon has
       forked or not.  You can specify intended debug output using -f or
       --debugfile command line argument. Values "stdout" and "stderr" passed
       to cwdaemon with these arguments are recognized as special file names.
       "syslog" value is also treated as special value, but is not supported
       at the moment. Every other value will be treated as path to disc file.
       "stdout" is a default debug output for non-forked cwdaemon. You don't
       have to specify this explicitly through command line arguments, but you
       can.


       Regardless of values passed through -f or --debugfile arguments,
       cwdaemon opens a syslog file and (when forked) prints some (few)
       messages to the syslog. There is no way to override this at the moment.
       Which messages are always printed to syslog, and which can be printed
       to other file, is settled for now, but may be changed in the future.
       Don't depend too much on current setup.




BUGS
       When an escaped request "f" (change sound system) is sent asking for
       switching to sound system that is generally supported by libcw, but not
       available on given machine, cwdaemon will not recognize that the sound
       system is not available. It will close current audio system, and will
       attempt to open unavailable audio system. That fails, and cwdaemon
       falls back to Null audio system. If the falling back fails, it will
       result in cwdaemon working without any sound system, and it may
       potentially crash the daemon on next attempt to play audio.
