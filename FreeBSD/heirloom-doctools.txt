ADDBIB(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              ADDBIB(1)

NAME
     addbib – create or extend bibliographic database

SYNOPSIS
     addbib [-p promptfile] [-a] database

DESCRIPTION
     When this program starts up, answering ‘y’ to the initial “Instructions?”
     prompt yields directions; typing ‘n’ or RETURN skips them.  addbib then
     prompts for various bibliographic fields, reads responses from the
     terminal, and sends output records to a database.  A null response ⟨just
     RETURN⟩ means to leave out that field.  A minus sign ⟨-⟩ means to go back
     to the previous field. A trailing backslash allows a field to be
     continued on the next line. The repeating “Continue?” prompt allows the
     user either to resume by typing ‘y’ or RETURN, to quit the current
     session by typing ‘n’ or ‘q’, or to edit the database with any system
     editor ⟨vi, ex, edit, ed⟩,

     The -a option suppresses prompting for an abstract; asking for an
     abstract is the default.  Abstracts are ended with a CTRL-d.  The -p
     option causes addbib to use a new prompting skeleton, defined in
     promptfile.  This file should contain prompt strings, a tab, and the key-
     letters to be written to the database.

     The most common key-letters and their meanings are given below.  addbib
     insulates you from these key-letters, since it gives you prompts in
     English, but if you edit the bibliography file later on, you will need to
     know this information.

     %A            Author's name
     %B            Book containing article referenced
     %C            City (place of publication)
     %D            Date of publication
     %E            Editor of book containing article referenced
     %F            Footnote number or label (supplied by refer)
     %G            Government order number
     %H            Header commentary, printed before reference
     %I            Issuer (publisher)
     %J            Journal containing article
     %K            Keywords to use in locating reference
     %L            Label field used by -k option of refer
     %M            Bell Labs Memorandum (undefined)
     %N            Number within volume
     %O            Other commentary, printed at end of reference
     %P            Page number(s)
     %Q            Corporate or Foreign Author (unreversed)
     %R            Report, paper, or thesis (unpublished)
     %S            Series title
     %T            Title of article or book
     %V            Volume number
     %X            Abstract — used by roffbib, not by refer
     %Y,Z          ignored by refer

     Except for ‘A’, each field should be given just once. Only relevant
     fields should be supplied.  An example is:

     %A            Bill Tuthill
     %T            Refer — A Bibliography System
     %I            Computing Services
     %C            Berkeley
     %D            1982
     %O            UNX 4.3.5.
