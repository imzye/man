LPRM(1)                 FreeBSD General Commands Manual                LPRM(1)

NAME
     lprm – remove jobs from the line printer spooling queue

SYNOPSIS
     lprm [-Pprinter] [-] [job # ...] [user ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The lprm utility will remove a job, or jobs, from a printer's spool
     queue.  Since the spooling directory is protected from users, using lprm
     is normally the only method by which a user may remove a job.  The owner
     of a job is determined by the user's login name and host name on the
     machine where the lpr(1) command was invoked.

     Options and arguments:

     -Pprinter
             Specify the queue associated with a specific printer (otherwise
             the default printer is used).

     -       If a single ‘-’ is given, lprm will remove all jobs which a user
             owns.  If the super-user employs this flag, the spool queue will
             be emptied entirely.

     user    Cause lprm to attempt to remove any jobs queued belonging to that
             user (or users).  This form of invoking lprm is useful only to
             the super-user.

     job_#   A user may dequeue an individual job by specifying its job
             number.  This number may be obtained from the lpq(1) program,
             e.g.

                   % lpq -l

                   1st:ken                         [job #013ucbarpa]
                           (standard input)        100 bytes
                   % lprm 13

     If neither arguments or options are given, lprm will delete the currently
     active job if it is owned by the user who invoked lprm.

     The lprm utility announces the names of any files it removes and is
     silent if there are no jobs in the queue which match the request list.

     The lprm utility will kill off an active daemon, if necessary, before
     removing any spooling files.  If a daemon is killed, a new one is
     automatically restarted upon completion of file removals.

ENVIRONMENT
     If the following environment variable exists, it is utilized by lprm.

     PRINTER  If the environment variable PRINTER exists, and a printer has
              not been specified with the -P option, the default printer is
              assumed from PRINTER.

FILES
     /etc/printcap       Printer characteristics file.
     /var/spool/*        Spooling directories.
     /var/spool/*/lock   Lock file used to obtain the pid of the current
                         daemon and the job number of the currently active
                         job.

DIAGNOSTICS
     ``Permission denied" if the user tries to remove files other than his
     own.

SEE ALSO
     lpq(1), lpr(1), lpd(8)

HISTORY
     The lprm command appeared in 3.0BSD.

BUGS
     Since there are race conditions possible in the update of the lock file,
     the currently active job may be incorrectly identified.
