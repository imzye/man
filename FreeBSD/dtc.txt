NAME
     dtc – device tree compiler

SYNOPSIS
     dtc [-@fhsv] [-b boot_cpu_id] [-d dependency_file] [-E [no-]checker_name]
         [-H phandle_format] [-I input_format] [-O output_format]
         [-o output_file] [-R entries] [-S bytes] [-p bytes] [-V blob_version]
         [-W [no-]checker_name] [-P predefined_properties] input_file

DESCRIPTION
     The dtc utility converts between flattened device tree (FDT)
     representations.  It is most commonly used to generate device tree blobs
     (DTB), the binary representation of an FDT, from device tree sources
     (DTS), the ASCII text source representation.

     The binary can be written in two formats, binary and assembly.  The
     binary is identical to the in-memory representation and can be used
     directly by firmware, loaders, and so on.  The assembly format,
     documented in ASM FORMAT, will produce the same binary format when
     assembled, but also includes some global variables that refer to parts of
     the table.  This format is most commonly used to produce a kernel
     specific to a device, with the device tree blob compiled in.

     The options are as follows:

     -d dependency_file
             Writes a dependency file understandable by make to the specified
             file.  This file can be included in a Makefile and will ensure
             that the output file depends on the input file and any files that
             it includes.  This argument is only useful when the input is DTS,
             as only the source format has a notion of inclusions.

     -E [no-]checker_name
             Enable or disable a specified checker.  The argument is the name
             of the checker.  The full list of checkers is given in CHECKERS.

     -@      Emit a __symbols__ node to allow plugins to be loaded.

     -f      Force the tool to attempt to generate the output, even if the
             input had errors.

     -h      Display the help text and exit.

     -H phandle_format
             Specifies the type of phandle nodes to generate in the output.
             Valid values are:

             linux   Generate the legacy linux,phandle nodes expected by older
                     systems.
             epapr   Generate the phandle nodes, as described in the ePAPR
                     specification.  This is the most sensible option for
                     device trees being used with FreeBSD.
             both    Generate both, for maximum compatibility.

     -I input_format
             Specifies the input format.  Valid values are:

             dtb     Device tree blob.  The binary representation of the FDT.
             dts     Device tree source.  The ASCII representation of the FDT.
                     This is the default if the input format is not explicitly
                     stated.

     -O output_format
             Specifies the output format.  Valid values are:

             asm     Assembler source for generating a device tree blob, as
                     described in ASM FORMAT.
             dtb     Device tree blob.  The binary representation of the FDT.
                     This is the default if the output format is not
                     explicitly stated.
             dts     Device tree source.  The ASCII representation of the FDT.

     -o output_file
             The file to which to write the output.

     -P predefined_macro
             Defines a macro, in the form name=value or name to be used for
             device tree source files that contain conditional components.
             This tool supports two extensions to the standard to support
             conditional compilation of device trees.  The first is an
             /include/if [property]/ file.dts directive that is allowed at the
             start of a file and which will only include the specified file if
             it the specified property is passed with this flag.  The second
             is the $NAME format for property values.  These allow property
             value to be specified on the command line.

     -R entries
             The number of empty reservation table entries to pad the table
             with.  This is useful if you are generating a device tree blob
             for bootloader or similar that needs to reserve some memory
             before passing control to the operating system.

     -S bytes
             The minimum size in bytes of the blob.  The blob will be padded
             after the strings table to ensure that it is the correct size.
             This is useful for environments where the device tree blob must
             be modified in place.

     -p bytes
             The number of bytes of padding to add to the blob.  The blob will
             be padded after the strings table to ensure that it is the
             correct size.  This is useful for environments where the device
             tree blob must be modified in place.

     -W [no-]checker_name
             Enable or disable a specified checker.  This is an alias for -E.

     -s      Sorts the properties and nodes in the tree.  This is mainly
             useful when using tools like diff(1) to compare two device tree
             sources.

     -V output_version
             The version of the format to output.  This is only relevant for
             binary outputs, and only a value of 17 is currently supported.

     -v      Display the tool version and exit.

     input_file
             The source file.

ASM FORMAT
     The assembly format defines several globals that can be referred to from
     other compilation units, in addition to any labels specified in the
     source.  These are:

           dt_blob_start     start of the device tree blob.
           dt_header         start of the header, usually identical to the
                             start of the blob.
           dt_reserve_map    start of the reservation map.
           dt_struct_start   start of the structure table.
           dt_struct_end     end of the structure table.
           dt_strings_start  start of the strings table.
           dt_strings_end    end of the strings table.
           dt_blob_end       end of the device tree blob.

CHECKERS
     The utility provides a number of semantic checks on the correctness of
     the tree.  These can be disabled with the -W flag.  For example, -W
     no-type-phandle will disable the phandle type check.  The supported
     checks are:

           type-compatible  Checks the type of the compatible property.
           type-model       Checks the type of the model property.
           type-compatible  Checks the type of the compatible property.
           cells-attributes
                            Checks that all nodes with children have both
                            #address-cells and #size-cells properties.
           deleted-nodes    Checks that all /delete-node/ statements refer to
                            nodes that are merged.

OVERLAYS
     The utility provides support for generating overlays, also known as
     plugins.  Overlays are a method of patching a base device tree that has
     been compiled with the -@ flag, with some limited support for patching
     device trees that were not compiled with the -@ flag.

     To denote that a DTS is intended to be used as an overlay, /plugin/;
     should be included in the header, following any applicable /dts-v1/; tag.

     Conventional overlays are crafted by creating fragment nodes in a root.
     Each fragment node must have either a target property set to a label
     reference, or a target-path string property set to a path.  It must then
     have an __overlay__ child node, whose properties and child nodes are
     merged into the base device tree when the overlay is applied.

     Much simpler syntactic sugar was later invented to simplify generating
     overlays.  Instead of creating targetted fragments manually, one can
     instead create a root node that targets a label in the base FDT using the
     &label syntax supported in conventional DTS.  This will indicate that a
     fragment should be generated for the node, with the given label being the
     target, and the properties and child nodes will be used as the
     __overlay__.

     Additionally, a path-based version of this syntactic sugar is supported.
     A root node may target a path in the base FDT using a name of the form
     &{/path}.  A fragment will be generated for the node as it is in the
     &label case, except the target-path property will be set to /path and no
     target will be set.

     Both conventional overlays and the later-added syntactic sugar are
     supported.

     Overlay blobs can be applied at boot time by setting fdt_overlays in
     loader.conf(5).  Multiple overlays may be specified, and they will be
     applied in the order given.

NODE OMISSION
     This utility supports the /omit-if-no-ref/ statement to mark nodes for
     omission if they are ultimately not referenced elsewhere in the device
     tree.  This may be used in more space-constrained environments to remove
     nodes that may not be applicable to the specific device the tree is being
     compiled for.

     When the -@ flag is used to write symbols, nodes with labels will be
     considered referenced and will not be removed from the tree.

EXAMPLES
     The command:

           dtc -o blob.S -O asm device.dts

     will generate a blob.S file from the device tree source device.dts and
     print errors if any occur during parsing or property checking.  The
     resulting file can be assembled and linked into a binary.

     The command:

           dtc -o - -O dts -I dtb device.dtb

     will write the device tree source for the device tree blob device.dtb to
     the standard output.  This is useful when debugging device trees.

     The command:

           dtc -@ -O dtb -I dts -o device.dtb device.dts

     will generate a device.dtb file from the device tree source device.dts
     with a __symbols__ node included so that overlays may be applied to it.

     The command:

           dtc -@ -O dtb -I dts -o device_overlay.dtbo device_overlay.dts

     will generate a device_overlay.dtbo file, using the standard extension
     for a device tree overlay, from the device tree source
     device_overlay.dts.  A __symbols__ node will be included so that overlays
     may be applied to it.  The presence of a /plugin/; directive in
     device_overlay.dts will indicate to the utility that it should also
     generate the underlying metadata required in overlays.

COMPATIBILITY
     This utility is intended to be compatible with the device tree compiler
     provided by elinux.org.  Currently, it implements the subset of features
     required to build FreeBSD and others that have been requested by FreeBSD
     developers.

     The fs input format is not supported.  This builds a tree from a Linux
     /proc/device-tree, a file system hierarchy not found in FreeBSD, which
     instead exposes the DTB directly via a sysctl.

     The warnings and errors supported by the elinux.org tool are not
     documented.  This tool supports the warnings described in the CHECKERS
     section.

STANDARDS
     The device tree formats understood by this tool conform to the Power.org
     Standard for Embedded Power Architecture Platform Requirements (ePAPR),
     except as noted in the BUGS section and with the following exceptions for
     compatibility with the elinux.org tool:

     •   The target of cross references is defined to be a node name in the
         specification, but is in fact a label.

     The /include/ directive is not part of the standard, however it is
     implemented with the semantics compatible with the elinux.org tool.  It
     must appear in the top level of a file, and imports a new root
     definition.  If a file, plus all of its inclusions, contains multiple
     roots then they are merged.  All nodes that are present in the second but
     not the first are imported.  Any that appear in both are recursively
     merged, with properties from the second replacing those from the first
     and properties child nodes being recursively merged.

HISTORY
     A dtc tool first appeared in FreeBSD 9.0.  This version of the tool first
     appeared in FreeBSD 10.0.

AUTHORS
     dtc was written by David T. Chisnall.  Some features were added later by
     Kyle Evans.

     Note: The fact that the tool and the author share the same initials is
     entirely coincidental.

BUGS
     The device tree compiler does not yet support the following features:

     •   Labels in the middle of property values.  This is only useful in the
         assembly output, and only vaguely useful there, so is unlikely to be
         added soon.
     •   Full paths, rather than labels, as the targets for phandles.  This is
         not very hard to add, but will probably not be added until something
         actually needs it.

     The current version performs a very limited set of semantic checks on the
     tree.  This will be improved in future versions.
