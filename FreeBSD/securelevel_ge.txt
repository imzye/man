NAME
     securelevel_gt, securelevel_ge – test active securelevel

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/proc.h>

     int
     securelevel_gt(struct ucred *cr, int level);

     int
     securelevel_ge(struct ucred *cr, int level);

DESCRIPTION
     These functions test the active security level against the given level.
     If the calling credential cr was imprisoned by the jail(2) system call,
     and has a different security level set than the host environment, the
     security level with the highest value is used.

     The securelevel_gt() function will evaluate whether or not the active
     security level is greater than the supplied level.

     The securelevel_ge() function will evaluate whether or not the active
     security level is greater than or equal to the supplied level.

RETURN VALUES
     These functions return EPERM if condition evaluated to true, and 0
     otherwise.
