IG4(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 IG4(4)

NAME
     ig4 – Synopsys DesignWare I2C Controller

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines into
     the kernel configuration file:

           device ig4
           device iicbus

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           ig4_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The ig4 driver provides access to peripherals attached to an I2C
     controller.

HARDWARE
     ig4 supports the I2C controllers based on Synopsys DesignWare IP that can
     be found in Intel(R) Core(TM) processors starting from the fourth
     generation, Intel(R) Bay Trail, Apollo Lake SoC families, and some AMD
     systems.

SYSCTL VARIABLES
     These sysctl(8) variables are available:

     debug.ig4_dump  This sysctl is a zero-based bit mask.  When any of the
                     bits are set, a register dump is printed for every I2C
                     transfer on an ig4 device with the same unit number.

SEE ALSO
     iic(4), iicbus(4)

AUTHORS
     The ig4 driver was written for DragonFly by Matthew Dillon and
     subsequently ported to FreeBSD by Michael Gmelin <freebsd@grem.de>.
