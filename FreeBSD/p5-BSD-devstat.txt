NAME
       BSD::devstat - interface to devstat(3) API

SYNOPSIS
         use BSD::devstat;

         my $ds = BSD::devstat->new();
         printf "Number of devices: %d\n", $ds->numdevs;

         my $devidx = $ds->numdevs;    # this is last device.

         my $dev = $ds->devices($devidx);
         printf "%s%d block_size=%d\n", $dev->{device_name},
           $dev->{unit_number}, $dev->{block_size};

         # Stat in 2 seconds.
         my $stat = $ds->compute_statistics($devidx, 2.0);
         printf "BUSY_PCT=%.2f\n", $stat->{BUSY_PCT};

DESCRIPTION
       BSD::devstat is interface to devstat(3) API.  You can grab device
       statistics information which is provided by devstat(9) kernel interface
       via devstat(3) userland interface.

       new()
           Retrieve device statistics and store it as BSD::devstat object.

       numdevs()
           Return the number of devices which devstat(3) API provided.

       devices($device_index)
           $device_index is index for device, which can be from 0 to
           ($self->numdevs() - 1).  Returns hash reference.  This contains
           various values described in devstat(9) manpage.  This method will
           croak if error occured.

       compute_statistics($device_index, $elapse_time)
           $device_index is index for device, which can be from 0 to
           ($self->numdevs() - 1).  $elapse_time is second (can be float
           number) between two snapshots of statistics and calculation by done
           with these statistics.  Returns hash reference.  This contains
           various values described at devstat_compute_statistics() function
           in devstat(3) manpage.  This method will croak if error occured.
