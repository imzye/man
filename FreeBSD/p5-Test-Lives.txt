NAME
       Test::Lives - decorate tests with a no-exceptions assertion

SYNOPSIS
        use Test::More;
        use Test::Lives;

        use System::Under::Test 'might_die';

        lives_and { is might_die, 'correct', $_ } 'system under test is correct';

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides only one function, "lives_and", which works almost
       exactly like the function of the same name in Test::Exception. That is,
       it allows you to test things that could (but shouldn't) throw an
       exception without having to have two separate tests with two separate
       results (and two separate descriptions).

       You pass it a block of code to run (which should contain one test
       assertion) and a test description to give the assertion inside the
       block.

       The description will be available inside the block in the $_ variable.
       (This is different from Test::Exception, which employs hacky magic to
       relieve you of having to pass the description to the decorated
       assertion.)

       If the block ends up throwing an exception, a test failure will be
       logged.
