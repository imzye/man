NAME
     jps – Wrapper to ps(1) that maps pids to jails

SYNOPSIS
     jps [<ps options>] [lj] [long_jails] [ll] [long_lines] [i] [install]

DESCRIPTION
     This a perl wrapper to ps(1) that gets its output and maps pids to jails.

     The wrapper takes all ps(1) options and passed then to the ps(1) if some
     specified. When no options specified the wrapper uses default options.

     No additional software or tools like jailer(8) needed.

OPTIONS
     One or more of the following options to jps may be combined arbitrarily.

     <ps options>   Options to be passed to ps(1)
     lj             Use full jail hostnames
     long_jails     Same as lj
     ll             Do not cut long lines
     long_lines     Same as ll
     i              Install Term::ReadKey from ports
     install        Same as i
