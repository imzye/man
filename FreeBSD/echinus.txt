ECHINUS(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             ECHINUS(1)

NAME
     echinus – a lightweight window manager for X11

SYNOPSIS
     echinus [-v] [-f conf]

DESCRIPTION
     echinus is a lightweight window manager for X based on dwm's source code.
     It manages windows in maximized, floating and tiled layouts.  Either
     layout can be applied dynamically, optimizing the environment for the
     application in use and the task performed.

     In maximized layout only one window can be seen at the moment, but you
     can switch between them with hotkeys.  In floating layout windows can be
     resized and moved freely.  Dialog windows are always managed floating,
     regardless of the layout applied.

     Windows are grouped by tags. Each window can be tagged with one or
     multiple tags. Selecting certain tags displays all windows with these
     tags.

     echinus draws a small border around windows to indicate the focus state
     and an optional titlebar.

     The options are as follows:

     -v            Prints version information to standard output, then exits.

     -f conf       Specifies an alternative configuration file.  By default,
                   echinus loads the configuration file from
                   ~/.echinus/echinusrc, if present, then looks for the
                   system-wide configuration file CONFDIR/echinusrc.

     The following notation is used in this page:

           A       Alt.
           C       Control.
           S       Shift.
           W       Windows key.
           M1      Left mouse button.
           M2      Middle mouse button.
           M3      Right mouse button.

KEY BINDINGS
     The default key bindings are:

           A-[F1..Fn]    Views all windows with n-th tag.
           A-Return      Zooms/cycles current window to/from master area
                         (tiled layout only).
           A-Space       Toggles between tiled and floating layout (affects
                         all windows).
           A-Tab         Toggles to the previously selected tags.
           A-b           Toggles on/off statusbar space.
           A-f           Enables floating mode.
           A-h           Decreases the master area width about 5% (tiled
                         layout only).
           A-i           Enables floating mode.
           A-j           Focuses next window.
           A-k           Focuses previous window.
           A-l           Increases the master are width about 5% (tiled layout
                         only).
           A-m           Enables maximized (monocle) mode.
           A-r           Enables tiled mode.
           A-t           Starts xterm.
           A-w           Enables bottom-tiled mode.
           A-C-[1..n]    Adds/removes all windows with n-th tag to/from the
                         view.
           A-C-q         Quits echinus.
           A-C-S-[1..n]  Adds/removes n-th tag to/from current window.
           A-S-[1..n]    Applies n-th tag to current window.
           A-S-c         Closes focused window.

MOUSE BINDINGS
     The default mouse bindings are:

           M1        When pressed on the titlebar, focuses window and raises
                     it on top of the stack.
           M2        When pressed on the titlebar, resizes window.
           M3        When pressed on the root window, draws a rectangle to
                     start a terminal in it.
           A-M1      Moves current window while dragging.  Tiled windows will
                     be toggled to the floating state.
           A-M2      Zooms/cycles current window to/from master area.  If it
                     is floating (but not fixed) it will be toggled to the
                     tiled state, instead.
           A-M3      Resizes current window while dragging.  Tiled windows
                     will be toggled to the floating state.
