OPTIONS
       -config [CONFIG]
           Load configuration file CONFIG.  All options specified before
           -config will be overwritten by the options in CONFIG.  This options
           can be used multiple times.

       -save [CONFIG]
           Save the configuration provided by the options on the command line
           and all loaded configuration files to the file CONFIG.

       -720
           Use the resolution 1280x720 for streaming.  This is the default
           option.

       -1080
           Use the resolution 1920x1080 for streaming.

       -4k Use the resolution 3840x2160 for streaming.

       -width [WIDTH]
           Change the horizontal resolution to WIDTH

       -height [HEIGHT]
           Change the vertical resolution to HEIGHT

       -fps [FPS]
           Change the number of frame per second to FPS.  Defaults to 60 FPS.

       -bitrate [BITRATE]
           Change bitrate to BITRATE Kbps.  By default the bitrate depends on
           the selected resolution and FPS.  For resolution 1080p and 60 FPS
           and higher, 20 Mbps is used.  For resolution 1080p or 60 FPS and
           higher, 10 Mbps is used For other configurations, 5 Mbps is used by
           default.

       -packetsize [PACKETSIZE]
           Change the network packetsize to PACKETSIZE bytes.  The packetsize
           should the smaller than the MTU of the network.  This value must be
           a multiple of 16.  By default, 1392 is used on LAN and 1024 on WAN.

       -codec [CODEC]
           Select codec to use.  Can be 'auto', 'h264', 'h265', 'hevc', or
           'av1'.  Not all video decoders support H.265/HEVC or AV1.  Will
           still use H.264 if server doesn't support HEVC or AV1.

       -remote [yes/no/auto]
           Enable optimizations for LAN or WAN streaming.

       -app [APP]
           Change the requested app to execute to APP.  By default Steam is
           started.

       -nosops
           Stop GFE from changing the graphical settings of the requested game
           or application.

       -localaudio
           Play the audio on the host computer instead of this device.

       -surround [5.1/7.1]
           Enable surround sound instead of stereo.

       -keydir [DIRECTORY]
           Change the directory to save encryption keys to DIRECTORY.  By
           default the encryption keys are stored in $XDG_CACHE_DIR/moonlight
           or ~/.cache/moonlight

       -mapping [MAPPING]
           Use MAPPING as the mapping file for all inputs.  This mapping file
           should have the same format as the gamecontrollerdb.txt for SDL2.
           By default the gamecontrollerdb.txt provided by Moonlight Embedded
           is used.

       -platform [PLATFORM]
           Select platform for audio and video output and input.  <PLATFORM>
           can be pi, imx, aml, x11, x11_vdpau, sdl or fake.

       -nounsupported
           Don't stream if resolution is not officially supported by the
           server

       -quitappafter
           Send quit app request to remote after quitting session

       -viewonly
           Disable all input processing (view-only mode)

       -nomouseemulation
           Disable gamepad mouse emulation (activated by long pressing Start
           button)

       -verbose
           Enable verbose output

       -debug
           Enable verbose and debug output

       -input [INPUT]
           Enable the INPUT device.  By default all available input devices
           are enabled.  Only evdev devices /dev/input/event* are supported.

       -audio [DEVICE]
           Use <DEVICE> as audio output device.  The default value is
           'sysdefault' for ALSA and 'hdmi' for OMX on the Raspberry Pi.

       -windowed
           Display the stream in a window instead of fullscreen.  Only
           available when X11 or SDL platform is used.

CONFIG FILE
       Moonlight Embedded will load a confiuration file from:

         $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/moonligt/moonlight.conf (fallback to ~/.config/moonligt/moonlight.conf)

       If no user specified configuration file is available the configuration
       will be loaded from:

         /usr/local/etc/moonlight/moonlight.conf

       A documented example configuration file can be found at
       /usr/local/etc/moonlight/moonlight.conf.

COMMENTS
       Use Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Q or Play+Back+LeftShoulder+RightShoulder to quit
       the streaming session.
