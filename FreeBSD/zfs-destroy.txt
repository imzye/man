ZFS-DESTROY(8)          FreeBSD System Manager's Manual         ZFS-DESTROY(8)

NAME
     zfs-destroy – destroy ZFS dataset, snapshots, or bookmark

SYNOPSIS
     zfs destroy [-Rfnprv] filesystem|volume
     zfs destroy [-Rdnprv] filesystem|volume@snap[%snap[,snap[%snap]]]…
     zfs destroy filesystem|volume#bookmark

DESCRIPTION
     zfs destroy [-Rfnprv] filesystem|volume
       Destroys the given dataset.  By default, the command unshares any file
       systems that are currently shared, unmounts any file systems that are
       currently mounted, and refuses to destroy a dataset that has active
       dependents (children or clones).

       -R  Recursively destroy all dependents, including cloned file systems
           outside the target hierarchy.

       -f  Forcibly unmount file systems.  This option has no effect on non-
           file systems or unmounted file systems.

       -n  Do a dry-run ("No-op") deletion.  No data will be deleted.  This is
           useful in conjunction with the -v or -p flags to determine what
           data would be deleted.

       -p  Print machine-parsable verbose information about the deleted data.

       -r  Recursively destroy all children.

       -v  Print verbose information about the deleted data.

       Extreme care should be taken when applying either the -r or the -R
       options, as they can destroy large portions of a pool and cause
       unexpected behavior for mounted file systems in use.

     zfs destroy [-Rdnprv] filesystem|volume@snap[%snap[,snap[%snap]]]…
       The given snapshots are destroyed immediately if and only if the zfs
       destroy command without the -d option would have destroyed it.  Such
       immediate destruction would occur, for example, if the snapshot had no
       clones and the user-initiated reference count were zero.

       If a snapshot does not qualify for immediate destruction, it is marked
       for deferred deletion.  In this state, it exists as a usable, visible
       snapshot until both of the preconditions listed above are met, at which
       point it is destroyed.

       An inclusive range of snapshots may be specified by separating the
       first and last snapshots with a percent sign.  The first and/or last
       snapshots may be left blank, in which case the filesystem's oldest or
       newest snapshot will be implied.

       Multiple snapshots (or ranges of snapshots) of the same filesystem or
       volume may be specified in a comma-separated list of snapshots.  Only
       the snapshot's short name (the part after the @) should be specified
       when using a range or comma-separated list to identify multiple
       snapshots.

       -R  Recursively destroy all clones of these snapshots, including the
           clones, snapshots, and children.  If this flag is specified, the -d
           flag will have no effect.

       -d  Destroy immediately.  If a snapshot cannot be destroyed now, mark
           it for deferred destruction.

       -n  Do a dry-run ("No-op") deletion.  No data will be deleted.  This is
           useful in conjunction with the -p or -v flags to determine what
           data would be deleted.

       -p  Print machine-parsable verbose information about the deleted data.

       -r  Destroy (or mark for deferred deletion) all snapshots with this
           name in descendent file systems.

       -v  Print verbose information about the deleted data.

           Extreme care should be taken when applying either the -r or the -R
           options, as they can destroy large portions of a pool and cause
           unexpected behavior for mounted file systems in use.

     zfs destroy filesystem|volume#bookmark
       The given bookmark is destroyed.
