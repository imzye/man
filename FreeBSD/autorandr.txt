AUTORANDR(1)            FreeBSD General Commands Manual           AUTORANDR(1)

NAME
       autorandr - automatically select a display configuration based on
       connected devices

SYNOPSIS
       autorandr [OPTION] [PROFILE]

DESCRIPTION
       This program automatically detects connected display hardware and then
       loads an appropriate X11 setup using xrandr. It also supports the use
       of display profiles for different hardware setups.

       Autorandr also includes several virtual configurations including off,
       common, clone-largest, horizontal, and vertical. See the documentation
       for explanation of each.

              xrandr arguments.

       --version
              Show version information and exit

FILES
       Configuration files are searched for in the autorandr directory in the
       colon separated list of paths in $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS - or in /etc/xdg if
       that var is not set.  They are then looked for in ~/.autorandr and if
       that doesn't exist, in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/autorandr or in
       ~/.config/autorandr if that var is unset.

       In each of those directories it looks for directories with config and
       setup in them.  It is best to manage these files with the autorandr
       utility.
