NAME
       MooseX::Meta::TypeConstraint::Structured - Structured type constraints

VERSION
       version 0.36

DESCRIPTION
       A structure is a set of Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint that are
       'aggregated' in such a way as that they are all applied to an incoming
       list of arguments.  The idea here is that a Type Constraint could be
       something like, "An "Int" followed by an "Int" and then a "Str"" and
       that this could be done so with a declaration like:

           Tuple[Int,Int,Str]; ## Example syntax

       So a structure is a list of type constraints (the "Int,Int,Str" in the
       above example) which are intended to function together.

ATTRIBUTES
   type_constraints
       A list of Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint objects.

   constraint_generator

METHODS
   validate
       Messing with validate so that we can support nicer error messages.

   generate_constraint_for ($type_constraints)
       Given some type constraints, use them to generate validation rules for
       an ref of values (to be passed at check time)

   parameterize (@type_constraints)
       Given a ref of type constraints, create a structured type.

   __infer_constraint_generator
   compile_type_constraint
       hook into compile_type_constraint so we can set the correct validation
       rules.

   create_child_type
       modifier to make sure we get the constraint_generator

   is_a_type_of
   is_subtype_of
   equals
       Override the base class behavior.

   type_constraints_equals
       Checks to see if the internal type constraints are equal.

   get_message
       Give you a better peek into what's causing the error.  For now we
       stringify the incoming deep value with Devel::PartialDump and pass that
       on to either your custom error message or the default one.  In the
       future we'll try to provide a more complete stack trace of the actual
       offending elements

       A subref or closure that contains the way we validate incoming values
       against a set of type constraints.

       This returns a CODEREF which generates a suitable constraint generator.
       Not user servicable, you'll never call this directly.
