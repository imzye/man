NAME
       Zenoss - Perl interface to the Zenoss JSON API

SYNOPSIS
           use Zenoss;
           use Data::Dumper;

           # Create a Zenoss object
           my $api = Zenoss->connect(
               {
                   username    => 'admin',
                   password    => 'zenoss',
                   url         => 'http://zenossinstance:8080',
               }
           );

           # Issue a request to get all devices from Zenoss Monitoring System
           my $response = $api->device_getDevices();

           # $response is now an instance of Zenoss::Response
           # now we can do things like
           print $response->json();
           print $response->http_code();

           # get the response in a perl reference
           my $ref = $response->decoded();
           print Dumper $ref;

           # Query events, with history, and only return
           # events that have a severity of 0,1,2,3,4 or 5
           my $events = $api->events_query(
               {
                   history => JSON::true,
                   params  => {
                       severity => [0,1,2,3,4,5],
                   }
               }
           );

PREREQUISITES
       Zenoss version >= 3.0 is required

DESCRIPTION
       The Zenoss Perl module ties components together that are vital to
       communicating with the Zenoss JSON API.  This module is a full service
       implementation that provides access to all documented API calls by the
       Zenoss Monitoring System.  Essentially, anything that can be
       accomplished via the Zenoss UI can be done programmatically via Perl.

       To get an idea of what requests can be issued to the Zenoss JSON API,
       please review the documentation for the following modules.

       •   Zenoss::Router::DetailNav

       •   Zenoss::Router::Device

       •   Zenoss::Router::Events

       •   Zenoss::Router::Messaging

       •   Zenoss::Router::Mib

       •   Zenoss::Router::Network

       •   Zenoss::Router::Process

       •   Zenoss::Router::Report

       •   Zenoss::Router::Search

       •   Zenoss::Router::Service

       •   Zenoss::Router::Template

       •   Zenoss::Router::Tree

       •   Zenoss::Router::ZenPack

       The documentation for these modules was mostly taken from the Zenoss
       JSON API docs.  Keep in mind that their (Zenoss Monitoring System)
       programming is based around python, so descriptions such as
       dictionaries will be represented as hashes in Perl.

METHODS
       Available methods provided by this module.

   $obj->connect({})
       This method instantiates an instance of Zenoss.  Currently it accepts
       the following arguments.  Note, these arguments are described in detail
       at Zenoss::Connector.

       •   username

       •   password

       •   url

       •   timeout

NOTES
       Here are some notes regarding this interface.

   Zenoss JSON API Arguments
       Arguments in methods

       When calling the various router methods available, note that any
       argument you submit will be converted to JSON and transmitted to the
       Zenoss API.

       For example:

           $api->device_getDevices(
               {
                   foo => 'bar',
               }
           );

       The above code will transmit an argument, in JSON, of foo with a value
       of bar to the API.

       Its also interesting to point out that each router method has an
       argument definition hard coded.  If you attempt to call a method that
       requires a specific argument, and its omitted, it will croak.

       JSON true, false, null

       Some router methods accept boolean arguments.  In the event that you
       need to use a true, false or null, the value can be submitted with:

       •   JSON::true

       •   JSON::false

       •   JSON::null

       For sake of clarity, say we need to add a device, but we want to also
       want to model the device after its added.  Reading
       Zenoss::Router::Device states that $obj->device_addDevice() has an
       available argument of 'model', which is a boolean.  With that said we
       can do the following:

           my $response = $api->device_addDevice(
               {
                   deviceName  => 'testdevice',
                   deviceClass => '/Server/Linux',
                   model       => JSON::true,
               }
           );

   Error handling
       Some methods Carp, so its always good to always try and trap
       exceptions.  This is mostly limited to when attempting to establish
       connections to the API, API timeouts, and argument checking.  Error
       handling of Zenoss API responses can be handled with the available
       methods in Zenoss::Response.

DOCUMENTATION
       Please let me know if there is trouble with the documentation.  I
       attempted to put a vast amount of information together all at once, so
       there may be some mistakes.  If you have a question about implementing
       something described in the documentation, let me know so I can clarify.
       However, please do not take advantage of this and only ask a question
       if you're really stuck.
