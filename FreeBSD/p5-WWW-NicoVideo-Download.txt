NAME
       WWW::NicoVideo::Download - Download FLV/MP4/SWF files from nicovideo.jp

SYNOPSIS
         use WWW::NicoVideo::Download;

         my $client = WWW::NicoVideo::Download->new(
             email => 'your-email@example.com',
             password => 'PASSWORD',
         );

         $client->download("smNNNNNN", \&callback);

DESCRIPTION
       WWW::NicoVideo::Download is a module to login, request and download
       video files from Nico Nico Douga.

METHODS
       new
             $client = WWW::NicoVideo::Download->new(%options);

           Creates a new WWW::NicoVideo::Download instance. %options can take
           the following parameters and they can also be set and get using
           accessor methods.

       email, password
           Sets and gets email and password to login Nico Nico Douga. Required
           if the User Agent object doesn't have the valid session or cookie
           to login to the site.

       user_agent
           Sets and gets LWP::UserAgent object to use to send HTTP requests to
           nicovideo.jp server. If you want to reuse the browser Cookie that
           has the signed-in state, you can set the Cookie to the UserAgent
           object here.

             # use Safari sesssions
             use HTTP::Cookies::Safari;
             my $cookie_jar = HTTP::Cookies::Safari->new(
                 file => "$ENV{HOME}/Library/Cookies/Cookies.plist",
             );
             my $client = WWW::NicoVideo::Download->new;
             $client->user_agent->cookie_jar( $cookie_jar );

       download
             $client->download($video_id, $file_path);

           Prepares the download by logging in and requesting the FLV API, and
           then download the video file. The second parameter is passed to
           LWP::UserAgent's request() method, so you can pass either local
           file path to be saved, or a callback function.

       prepare_download
             my $url = $client->prepare_download($video_id);

           Prepares the download and returns the URL of the actual video. See
           eg/fetch-video.pl how to make use of this method.
