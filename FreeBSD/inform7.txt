NAME
     i7 – Inform 7 programming language (CLI edition)

SYNOPSIS
     i7 story.ni
     i7 [-g] story.ni
     i7 [-r] story.scr story
     i7 [-w] story.key story
     i7 [-h]

DESCRIPTION
     Inform7 for FreeBSD is a CLI implementation of the Inform 7 programming
     language and environment by Graham Nelson.  Inform is a design system for
     interactive fiction (IF) based on natural language.

     Interactive fiction is a literary form which involves programming a
     computer so that it presents a reader with a text which can be explored.
     Inform aims to make the burden of learning to program such texts as light
     as possible.  It is a tool for writers intrigued by computing, and
     computer programmers intrigued by writing.  Perhaps these are not so very
     different pursuits, in their rewards and pleasures:

         The sheer joy of making things... the fascination of fashioning
         complex puzzle-like objects of interlocking moving parts and
         watching them work in subtle cycles... the delight of working in
         such a tractable medium.  The programmer, like the poet, works only
         slightly removed from pure thought-stuff.  He builds his castles in
         the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination.
         (Frederick P. Brooks, "The Mythical Man-Month", 1972)

     Inform7 for FreeBSD (CLI edition) implements the same basic features of
     the GUI edition.  You can write, compile, debug, and replay your own
     interactive fiction stories.

OPTIONS
     The following command line arguments are supported:

     -           create Z-code v8 release.

     -g          create Glulx release.

     -h          show usage.

     -r          replay game from a transcript file.

     -w          replay game from a walkthrough file.

EXAMPLES
     The most basic use of Inform7 for FreeBSD is:

     $ i7 story.ni

     which compiles your source story file into a Z-code v8 release.

     If you have a transcript file from game, you can use the -r option to
     replay it in story.z8

     $ i7 -r story.scr story.z8

     You will receive three files.
     story.$$.scr - new transcript file
     story.$$.key - walkthrough file
     story.$$.sav - save game from a transcript file

     You can also construct a simple walkthrough file and then automatically
     replay its sequence of commands in your stories.

     Example of a story.key
     VERBOSE
     L
     N
     W
     GET LAMP
     SCORE

     A walkthrough file can be very short, meant just to test some sequence
     of commands within your story, or it can be a full solution walkthrough.

     $ i7 -w story.key story.z8

     Once again you will receive three files.
     story.$$.scr - new transcript file
     story.$$.key - walkthrough file
     story.$$.sav - save game from a walkthrough file

FILES
     /usr/local/share/inform7
                 Directory where Inform extensions are stored.
