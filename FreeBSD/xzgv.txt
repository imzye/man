NAME
       xzgv - picture viewer for X, with thumbnail-based file selector

SYNOPSIS
       xzgv [options] [dir | file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       (NB: This man page is automagically generated from xzgv's texinfo file,
       and so may look a bit odd.  We apologise for the inconvenience. :-))

       xzgv is a picture viewer for X, with a thumbnail-based file selector.
       The thumbnails used (thumbnails being small `preview' versions of the
       pictures) are compatible with xv, zgv, and the Gimp. The kinds of
       pictures xzgv allows to be viewed are raster-format pictures (sometimes
       called `bitmaps' and/or `pixmaps'); things like GIF files, JPEG files,
       PNG files, and so on.

       Most of the time, you will probably want to use xzgv's file selector
       (see The File Selector) to pick which file(s) to view. This is what
       appears on the left-hand side of the window when you start xzgv as just
       `xzgv' (see Options). It displays a list of subdirectories and picture
       files in the current directory, along with small `thumbnail' versions
       of the pictures if they exist. (If no thumbnails appear in a given
       directory, or if they are missing for some files, you can create/update
       them by pressing `u'. See Updating Thumbnails.)

       When you've picked a file to view, you can view it by clicking on it,
       or pressing `Enter'. This reads the picture and displays it in the
       right-hand part of the window, the viewer (see The Viewer). You can
       then move around the picture (if it is larger than will fit) by
       dragging it with the mouse, or using the scrollbars, or the cursor
       keys. You can then select another image with the file selector (though
       you need to press `Esc' or `Tab' first if using the keyboard), or you
       can quit xzgv by pressing `q'.

       While xzgv works much like any other X program, and is certainly mouse-
       friendly :-), it's also designed to be keyboard-friendly.  Everything
       in xzgv can be done entirely from the keyboard. Much of this keyboard
       support works like the original zgv (a similar console-based picture
       viewer for Linux).

       This overview is, as you might expect, only the very simplest of
       introductions to what xzgv can do, and describes only a very basic use
       of xzgv. xzgv can do a lot more; read on to find out what.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
       xzgv was primarily written by Russell Marks, also the author of this
       manual. It is maintained by Reuben Thomas, who ported it to Gtk+ 2.

       Costa Sapuntzakis contributed code for much faster JPEG thumbnail
       generation (to zgv, which I adapted for xzgv).

       The directory/file icons used were loosely based on gmc's dir-
       close.xpm. I think Tuomas Kuosmanen was responsible for that, judging
       from the change log.

       `mkinstalldirs' is straight from the `texinfo' package, and was written
       by Noah Friedman. (This is also used during installation.)

       Huge thanks go to the many people responsible for GTK+, without which
       xzgv would almost certainly not have happened. (But no thanks for
       Electric Eyes, which was nearly nice enough for me not to bother with
       xzgv at all! :-))

       getopt*.[ch] are from the GNU libc.

OPTIONS
       Normally you'd invoke xzgv as plain `xzgv' (perhaps via a window
       manager menu, or GNOME/KDE menu, etc.). However, you can directly
       specify files to view, or a start directory, on the command-line. In
       addition, there are various options.

       (If you're new to xzgv, you should probably skip the rest of this
       section for now and come back to it later.)

       The general format of the xzgv command-line goes roughly like this:

       xzgv [options] [dir | file ...]

       Two types of options are supported --- the traditional Unix single-
       letter options, and GNU-style long options. Most options can be used in
       either way, and both forms are listed in the table below.

       Note that all options are processed after any configuration file(s).
       Config file settings are just like the long-option names below minus
       the `--' (see Configuring xzgv), though a few command-line options are
       not permitted as config file settings (e.g. `help'), and vice versa.

       Here's what the options do:

       `-a'
       `--auto-hide'
              Automatically hide selector when a picture is selected, allowing
              the viewer to use the whole window.

       `--careful-jpeg'
              Enable libjpeg `fancy upsampling'. xzgv defaults to using the
              faster method; as the libjpeg documentation puts it, ``The
              visual impact of the sloppier method is often very small.''

       `--delete-single-prompt'
              (Note that this is normally enabled; use `--delete-single-
              prompt=off' to disable it.) If disabled, xzgv will immediately
              delete a file when told to, without prompting for confirmation.
              (It's `single' because deleting multiple files at once will be
              supported in future, and that will have a separate prompt
              override.)

       `--dither-hicol'
              Use dithering in 15/16-bit, whatever the default setting is.
              See Viewer Options, for a discussion of benefits/drawbacks. You
              can also use `--dither-hicol=off' to disable this.

       `--exif-orient'
              In JPEG files, use Exif orientation tags (inserted by e.g.
              digital cameras) to correct image orientation before display.
              See Viewer Options, for details.

       `--fast-recursive-update'
              When doing a recursive thumbnail update, don't read existing
              thumbnails before updating. This is pretty much obsolete as of
              xzgv 0.7, as the speed increase is now negligible. But, it may
              still be useful if you want to update a huge number of small
              directories for which few if any updates are needed.

       `-f'
       `--fullscreen'
              Run fullscreen, using the entire screen for xzgv's window,
              without even any window-manager decorations (window frame, title
              bar, etc.) if possible.

       `-g geom'
       `--geometry geom'
              Set the xzgv window's geometry (position and/or size) to geom.
              The geometry string should be in the usual X format, with the
              extension that positions/sizes may have a `%' suffix meaning
              that they are treated as percentages of the screen width/height.
              The default geometry is `92%x85%'.

              For those unfamiliar with the way `geometry' works, here's a
              brief description of the syntax. It's `WxH', or `+X+Y', or
              `WxH+X+Y', where `W' is width, `H' height, `X' the x position,
              and `Y' the y position. The first form specifies only the size,
              the second only the position --- the `WxH+X+Y' form specifies
              both.

              Now, the `+X+Y' bit normally specifies where the top-left of the
              window is. But you can use `-' instead of `+' for the x and/or y
              position, in which case it specifies the gap between the
              right/bottom of the window and the right/bottom of the screen.
              (Note, however, that any window frame your window manager adds
              to the window is disregarded in this calculation, so you may
              need to experiment somewhat to get the desired position.) You
              can also use negative numbers with both `+' and `-' --- so
              `+-50+0' puts the window partly off the left of the screen, and
              `+0--50' puts it partly off the bottom of the screen --- but
              this is of questionable value. :-)

              Finally, as mentioned above, xzgv extends this syntax by
              allowing you to use `%' to specify percentages of the screen
              width/height rather than pixels, e.g. `50%x30%-30%-20%'. It also
              allows you to use real numbers such as `12.34', which can be
              useful with `%'.

       `-h'
       `--help'
              Display a list of options and a terse description of what the
              options do.

       `--image-bigness-threshold numpix'
              Set the boundary numpix after which images are considered `big',
              and are no longer rendered all-at-once (which gives much nicer
              scrolling, but is harder on memory and can be slow for big
              images) but are instead rendered piece-by-piece. Units are
              number of pixels in image (i.e. width times height), and the
              default is 2000000 pixels.

       `-i'
       `--images-only'
              Shows only directories and image file types in the selector,
              identified by their extensions.

       `--interpolate'
              Interpolate between the picture's pixels when scaling up (see
              Scaling). This usually looks nicer, but it's rather slow.

       `--mouse-scale-x'
              If enabled, control-clicking on the viewer scales only the X
              axis. (The default is to scale only the Y axis.)

       `--revert-orient'
              (Note that this is normally enabled; use `--revert-orient=off'
              to disable it.) If disabled, orientation (flip/mirror/rotate)
              state is retained between pictures (see Viewer Options).

       `--revert-scale'
              (Note that this is normally enabled; use `--revert-scale=off' to
              disable it.) If disabled, scaling is retained between pictures
              (see Viewer Options).

       `--selector-width'
              Set the default/initial size of the selector in pixels. The
              normal setting is 200.

       `-T'
       `--show-tagged'
              Show names of currently-tagged files on exiting xzgv. (They're
              listed to stdout, one per line.) This can be useful when you
              want to select multiple files graphically and work on them with
              something else.

       `--show-thumbnail-messages'
              Show on the status bar when thumbnails are being read. The
              status bar must be enabled for these messages to be visible, of
              course. :-)

       `-k'
       `--skip-parent'
              For the first directory shown, skip the cursor past .. (the
              parent dir). This can be useful when you'd like to immediately
              use space to `page' through the dir.

       `-o order'
       `--sort-order order'
              Set the initial sorting order used in the selector. Possible
              settings are `name', `ext', `size', and `date' (or `time'); only
              the first char of the setting (`n'/`e'/`s'/`d'/`t') need be
              given. The default is name order.

       `--sort-timestamp-type type'
              Set the timestamp type to use when using time/date sorting
              order.  Possible settings are `mtime' (default), `ctime', and
              `atime'; only the first char of the setting (`m'/`c'/`a') need
              be given.

       `--statusbar'
              Show a status bar below the selector; this, for example, says
              when a picture is being read.

       `-t'
       `--thin-rows'
              Use rows a third the normal height in the selector. This can be
              very useful on lower-resolution screens, or if you're really
              interested in filenames, not thumbnails.

       `-v'
       `--version'
              Show version number.

       `--version-gtk'
              Show version number of GTK+ xzgv is using.

       `-z'
       `--zoom'
              Fit picture to viewer window, whatever its actual size (see Zoom
              Mode).

       `-r'
       `--zoom-reduce-only'
              When in zoom mode, only reduce pictures to fit; i.e. make big
              pictures viewable all-at-once while leaving small picures
              intact.

       `-p'
       `--zoom-panorama'
              When in zoom mode, adjust only the most proportional dimension
              to fit, and allow scrolling on the other dimension; i.e. like a
              fit page width option in PDF readers, but not limited to
              horizontal adjusting.

       If started with `xzgv files', xzgv hides the file selector and treats
       the file or files as if they were the sole contents of a directory. (It
       also automatically loads the first file.) As such, you can use the Next
       Image and Previous Image commands to navigate between the images, or do
       Exit to Selector and use the selector directly.

       If started with `xzgv start-dir', xzgv starts up as usual, but with the
       selector starting on the directory specified (rather than the current
       directory).

       Settings which are either on or off (boolean) are, as you might expect,
       enabled by using e.g. `-z' or `--zoom'. However, there's an alternative
       long-option form for setting these, resembling how they're set in
       config files --- the syntax is `--option=state', where state is
       `on'/`y'/`yes'/`1' to enable the option, or `off'/`n'/`no'/`0' to
       disable it. The most useful thing about this is that it allows you to
       disable options which were previously enabled, by using e.g.
       `--zoom=off'.

       (Readers used to the way GNU-style long options work should note that,
       since this `on'/`off'/etc. arg is optional, you can't use the `--option
       arg' form in this case; it must be `--option=arg' for it to work.)

A NOTE ON NOTATION
       Much of this manual is taken up by a description of xzgv's various
       commands in its file selector and viewer. Most of these are available
       both from the keyboard, and from popup menus. (A popup menu appears
       when you press `F10' or `Menu', or right-click on the selector or the
       viewer; each has its own menu.) So in the manual, you will often see
       things rather like this:

       `key'
       `Selector menu, Menu the item is in, Menu item'
              Description of what the key/menu item does.

       Sometimes the key given has a `(Selector)' or `(Viewer)' suffix; this
       is because some keypresses in xzgv are specific to the selector or the
       viewer, and won't work unless the relevant part of xzgv has the
       keyboard focus.

THE FILE SELECTOR
       Usually, on starting up xzgv, you'll want to use the file selector ---
       the list of files on the left. (The other subwindow (on the right) is
       the viewer.) The selector lets you pick files to view (among other
       things). It lists the subdirectories and picture files in the current
       directory, along with small `thumbnail' versions of the pictures if
       they exist.

THE SELECTOR MENU
       Almost all selector commands are available from the selector's pop-up
       menu, which appears when you right-click anywhere on the selector. (You
       can also press `F10' or `Menu' to bring up the menu, but as there are
       keyboard shortcuts for just about everything in xzgv, this isn't often
       that useful. :-))

       Usually, it doesn't matter where on the selector you right-click.
       However, a few commands on the File menu operate on a single file, the
       one selected by the keyboard cursor. A problem when using the mouse,
       you might think --- but when you right-click on the selector, as well
       as popping up the menu, xzgv moves this cursor to the file you right-
       clicked on (if any). (You can see this by the way a hollow box is drawn
       around the file.) So to use e.g. Details on the File menu, you need to
       right-click on the file you want details on.

       Both the selector and viewer have `Help' menus, most items of which
       refer you to this manual:

       `F1'
       `Selector menu, Help, Contents'
       `Viewer menu, Help, Contents'
              View the manual's overall contents.

       `Selector menu, Help, The File Selector'
              View the manual's section on the file selector.

       `Viewer menu, Help, The Viewer'
              View the manual's section on the viewer.

       `Selector menu, Help, Index'
       `Viewer menu, Help, Index'
              View the manual's concept index.

       `Selector menu, Help, About'
       `Viewer menu, Help, About'
              Give some brief information about xzgv, including the version
              number and homepage.

       Currently, the way xzgv lets you read the manual is a bit crude; it
       runs the `info' program (see Top in the info-stnd info file) in an
       `xterm'.

EXITING XZGV
       You can exit xzgv either by using one of two exit keypresses, or by
       selecting the appropriate option from the selector's popup menu:

       `q'
       `Ctrl-q'
       `Selector menu, Exit xzgv'
              Quit xzgv.

       (There's also an exit option on the selector's File menu (`Selector
       menu, File, Exit'), as `Exit' is generally on any File menu.)

THUMBNAILS
       (This section is deliberately early on in the manual, as thumbnails are
       probably the most important feature of the file selector, so it's best
       that you know how to create/update them sooner rather than later.)

       Thumbnails are small versions of the pictures they represent, and are
       displayed by the file selector if they exist. xzgv uses xv-compatible
       thumbnails --- if you create thumbnails with xv they will work with
       xzgv, and vice versa. xzgv's thumbnails are also compatible with the
       Gimp, and zgv.

       If no thumbnail exists for a file, a small `document' icon appears
       instead (similar to the `folder' icon used for directories).

   Updating Thumbnails
       While thumbnails can be made relatively quickly, it's by no means an
       instant process. For this reason, thumbnails have to be created in
       advance, and are stored as files in their own right in a subdirectory
       .xvpics.

       xzgv never creates/updates thumbnails without you telling it to. So, if
       you enter a directory where the picture files don't have any
       thumbnails, or where the thumbnails seem to be out of date, you should
       press `u', or select Update Thumbnails from the selector's menu.  (Even
       if the thumbnails can't be written (say, if you don't have permission
       to write them), the selector will still show the updated thumbnails
       until you leave the directory.)

       Alternatively, you can create/update thumbnails for the current
       directory and all subdirectories by using `Alt-u' or Recursive Update.
       But be warned that a recursive update can take some time!

       `u'
       `Selector menu, Update Thumbnails'
              Create thumbnails for any files which don't have them, and
              update thumbnails which are older than the corresponding file.
              While this is going on, a window appears showing how far through
              the process xzgv is.

              While the update is in progress, you can abort it by clicking on
              the Cancel button, or pressing `Esc' or `Enter', or by clicking
              the delete-window button (if your window manager provides one)
              on the title bar. xzgv will stop once it has finished the
              thumbnail it is currently working on (if any).

       `Alt-u'
       `Selector menu, Recursive Update'
              Create/update thumbnails for all files in the current directory
              and all subdirectories. This can take some time, so you are
              prompted to confirm you really want to do this (see Dialog
              Boxes). Progress is indicated in much the same way as for a
              normal update, but only for the directory currently being
              updated --- the overall progress is not indicated, other than by
              the current dir being (as ever) displayed in the main window's
              title. You can abort a recursive thumbnail update in the same
              ways as for a normal update (see above).

              By default, xzgv behaves a little oddly when doing a recursive
              update, to give some consistency with the normal update. See
              Thumbnail Issues, for details.

   Thumbnail Issues
       Dealing with thumbnails can be `interesting' at times, and there are a
       few ways this influences things:

       - xzgv doesn't read the thumbnails in a directory all at once. Instead,
       it just reads the directory contents, then starts up what is
       effectively a kind of background task to read in the thumbnails. So
       xzgv may not be quite as responsive as usual for a short time after
       entering a directory with many thumbnails (say, a few hundred) --- but
       on the other hand, at least it is responding. :-)

       - The `background task' makes a special effort to show thumbnails for
       the files currently visible in the selector first, no matter how much
       you move around the list, but it reads them all in eventually.

       - The thumbnails used in xzgv require 256 colours to display. This can
       be a problem if you're running X in 256 colours or less as, even if
       you're running an 8-bit (256 colour) server, there will almost
       inevitably be fewer colours available. Currently, xzgv just uses
       whatever gdk reports as the closest match to each individual colour
       used in thumbnails. This gives a tolerable result on 8-bit servers,
       assuming gdk was able to allocate a large number of colours; however,
       it gives terrible results if it couldn't, or if running on 4-bit or
       1-bit servers. Sorry about this --- it should be fixed in future
       (either by using gdk to draw the thumbnail pixmaps, or by dithering
       them `by hand' to suit the colours available).

       - Finally, when doing a recursive thumbnail update, xzgv (by default)
       reads existing thumbnails in a directory before updating any. Or
       rather, it reads thumbnails for those files currently visible in the
       selector.  This can slow things down very slightly, but keeps the `look
       and feel' consistent with the normal update. (Still, you can disable
       this with the `--fast-recursive-update' command-line option (see
       Invoking xzgv) or equivalent config file entry (see Configuring xzgv).)

SELECTOR LAYOUT AND RESIZING
       The file selector is simply a list of subdirectories and filenames,
       along with any thumbnails that exist for them. The list is normally in
       asciibetical order (but you can change this; see Changing the Sorting
       Order). Names of directories are shown first, and they are shown in
       order at the beginning of the list, before all the picture files. Long
       filenames may not fit in the visible part of the file selector display;
       if so, there will be a horizontal scrollbar you can use to see the rest
       of the name(s) (you can use cursor left/right to do this from the
       keyboard).

       The list is very often larger than can fit on the screen at once. If
       this is the case, only part is shown at a time, but you can move around
       the list using the (vertical) scrollbar, or with cursor up/down and the
       like.

       If you find the selector window to be too small vertically, and would
       like to see more files at once, you can start xzgv fullscreen by using
       the -f option (see Options), and/or use `thin rows' mode (see File
       Selector Options).

       If you find the selector too small (or too big) horizontally, you can
       change this by moving the splitter line's `handle' (a small square
       button between the selector and viewer, near the bottom of the window),
       which changes the relative sizes of the selector and viewer. You can
       move it by dragging it with the mouse, or with these keys:

       `['
              Move the window split left.

       `Ctrl-['
              Move the window split left more slowly.

       `]'
              Move the window split right.

       `Ctrl-]'
              Move the window split right more slowly.

       `~'
              Reset the window split to its default position.

       You can also set the initial/default size of the selector --- in
       effect, the position of the window split --- using `--selector-width'
       (see Options) or the config file option `selector-width'.

MOVING AROUND THE LIST
       This section is mainly for those of us more inclined to the keyboard
       side of the force. :-) Mouse-happy types can freely skip it.

       When the selector has the keyboard focus, the cursor (or in GTK+
       jargon, the `focus row') is normally shown as a hollow box around one
       of the list's rows. This serves the following functions:

       - It selects a file for view commands to operate on.

       - It determines which part of the list is shown, as the part of the
       list shown onscreen always contains the cursor (unless you move around
       using the mouse).

       There are several commands for moving the cursor. In summary, most
       `special' keys like the cursors do what you'd imagine they do, but in
       more detail:

       `Cursor Up'
       `k'
              Move up.

       `Cursor Down'
       `j'
              Move down.

       `Page Up'
       `Ctrl-u'
              Move the cursor back roughly a page.

       `Page Down'
       `Ctrl-v'
              Move the cursor forward roughly a page.

       `Ctrl-Home'
       `Ctrl-a'
              Move the cursor to the start of the list.

       `Ctrl-End'
       `Ctrl-e'
              Move the cursor to the end of the list.

       `g'
       `''
              Move the cursor to the first filename starting with the next key
              pressed, which would generally be a letter or number. Case is
              significant; `a' and `A' are different. If no key is pressed
              within 2 seconds, the command is cancelled.

              If no files start with the specified character, it moves to the
              first file which starts with a later char (in asciibetical
              order). If there are none for which this is the case, it moves
              to the last file --- unless there are no files (just
              directories), in which case it has no effect.

VIEWING A FILE
       To view a file from the selector, you can click on it, or press `Enter'
       after moving the cursor to the relevant file, or right-click on the
       file and choose `File' then `Open'.

       `Enter'
       `Left-click-on-file'
       `Selector menu, File, Open'
              View the chosen picture file, or if a subdirectory is chosen,
              make that the current directory.

DIALOG BOXES
       See The Viewer, for details of how the viewer works.  If xzgv has a
       serious problem reading a file, it will give an error.  Errors are
       shown in dialogs which appear in the middle of the screen --- they stay
       there until you click Ok (or press `Enter' or `Esc').

       xzgv also uses similar dialog boxes for other things:

       - Getting confirmation that you want to do something. `Enter' or `y'
       picks `yes'; `Esc' or `n' picks no. (Again, you can click on the
       relevant button with the mouse to do the same.)

       - Showing progress when updating a thumbnail. This is a slightly
       unusual dialog, in that it automatically disappears when the update is
       complete.  However, it does provide a Cancel button which you can click
       to abort the update (pressing `Enter' or `Esc' does the same).

       - Reading a directory name. Here you should type the directory name
       then click Ok (or press `Enter'), or click Cancel (or press `Esc') to
       abort. The text-input `widget' used allows a certain amount of editing,
       including these keys:

       `Cursor Left'
       `Ctrl-b'
              Move the cursor left. (A vertical bar shows the cursor
              position.)

       `Cursor Right'
       `Ctrl-f'
              Move the cursor right.

       `Home'
       `Ctrl-a'
              Move the cursor to the start of the line.

       `End'
       `Ctrl-e'
              Move the cursor to the end of the line.

       `Backspace'
       `Ctrl-h'
              Delete char to the left of the cursor. (Note that `Backspace' is
              (usually) the key above the main `Enter' key; it is often
              labelled simply as an arrow.)

       `Delete'
       `Ctrl-d'
              Delete the char the cursor is on.

       You can also set the X selection (by selecting text with the mouse, or
       holding `Shift' while moving the cursor) to allow pasting text into
       other programs, and you can cut/copy/paste text in the usual ways:

       `Shift-Delete'
       `Ctrl-x'
              Cut text.

       `Ctrl-Insert'
       `Ctrl-c'
              Copy text.

       `Shift-Insert'
       `Ctrl-v'
              Paste text.

       You can paste text from (some) other programs using the latter command,
       too.

CLOSING A FILE
       Usually, when you view a file, the viewer subwindow keeps displaying it
       until you view a different file. However, if you `close' the file, the
       viewer stops displaying the file and returns to its initial state.

       `Ctrl-w'
       `Selector menu, File, Close'
              `Close' the currently-viewed file, clearing the viewer
              subwindow.

FILE DETAILS
       The listing the selector gives for a file is pretty sparse --- just the
       filename and (if the file has one) the accompanying thumbnail. While
       this does keep things simple, you sometimes want to know how much space
       a file takes up, when it was last modified, the dimensions of the
       image, that kind of thing. So, you can show details of a single file
       using the `file details' command:

       `:'
       `;'
       `Selector menu, File, Details'
              Show various details about the file pointed to by the keyboard
              cursor.  See The Selector Menu, for how to choose the file
              details are given for when using the mouse. (Basically, you
              right-click on the file when popping up the menu.)

       Most of the details shown come from the OS (by using the `stat(2)'
       system call), and should always be available unless you have limited
       permissions for the directory the file is in. The file dimensions
       (width/height), however, come from the file's thumbnail. If it doesn't
       have one, or if it's unreadable, or if it has one and it's readable but
       it doesn't mention the original image's width/height, then the Details
       from thumbnail area is greyed out.

       (In explanation of the latter point --- pre-5.0 versions of zgv did not
       generate width/height comments in thumbnails, so zgv users in
       particular may find the width/height details missing. (xzgv has always
       been ok, though, it's just zgv which had this problem.) Worse yet,
       versions 5.0 and 5.1 generated them with incorrect sizes for most
       JPEGs. To fix either problem for a given directory, do `rm -fr .xvpics'
       in that dir from a shell prompt and recreate the thumbnails with zgv
       5.2 or later, or xzgv/xv/Gimp.)

TAGGING
       The file selector is not restricted to working on one file at a time.
       You can `tag' as many (or as few) files as you wish, and certain
       commands described in this section will act on them.

       Initially, all files are untagged, and the filenames usually appear in
       black (though this depends on the GTK+ theme you're using). Tagged
       files appear in red.

   Tag and Untag Commands
       There are several ways to tag or untag files. The keyboard-based ones
       which work on individual files (also available on the Tagging menu)
       move the cursor down one row afterwards, to make tagging or untagging
       multiple files easier.

       To tag or untag a single file with the mouse, control-click (i.e. hold
       down the control key and click) on the relevant filename or thumbnail
       in the selector. It's true that you could use Tag and/or Untag on the
       Tagging menu (see The Selector Menu, for how to choose the file
       tagged/untagged when doing it this way), but this is usually much less
       convenient than using control-click. (The menu entries for those are
       really just for completeness.)

       There is also a command available in the viewer to tag the currently-
       viewed file. See Changing Picture, for details.

       `='
       `+'
       `Keypad +'
       `0'
       `Selector menu, Tagging, Tag'
              Tag file.

       `-'
       `Keypad -'
       `9'
       `Selector menu, Tagging, Untag'
              Untag file.

       `Alt ='
       `Alt-Keypad +'
       `Alt-0'
       `Selector menu, Tagging, Tag All'
              Tag all files.

       `Alt -'
       `Alt-Keypad -'
       `Alt-9'
       `Selector menu, Tagging, Untag All'
              Untag all files.

       `Alt-o'
       `Selector menu, Tagging, Toggle All'
              Toggle all tags. This inverts the tagged state, so that all
              previously tagged files become untagged, and all previously
              untagged files become tagged.

       Currently there is no way to toggle a (single) file's tag state from
       the keyboard.

   Moving Between Tagged Files
       These commands let you search for (move to) the next or previous tagged
       file (if any). Note that `next' and `previous' here are relative to the
       keyboard cursor's position; if you use these from the menu, be careful
       to right-click on the file you want to start the search from.

       `/'
       `Selector menu, Tagging, Next Tagged'
              Move to next tagged file in dir.

       `?'
       `Selector menu, Tagging, Previous Tagged'
              Move to previous tagged file in dir.

       Equivalent commands are also available in the viewer (see Changing
       Picture).

   Copying/Moving Files
       You can copy or move tagged files to a directory you specify. If no
       files are tagged, xzgv copies/moves the file the cursor is currently on
       --- unless the cursor is on a subdirectory, in which case it gives an
       error.

       `C (Shift-c)'
       `Selector menu, File, Copy'
              Copy tagged files (or the current file) to a given directory.
              xzgv asks for the destination directory using a dialog (see
              Dialog Boxes) and copies the files there. If it comes to copy a
              file but there is an existing file in the dir with the same
              name, the file is not copied and nor are any of the remaining
              files.

       `M (Shift-m)'
       `Selector menu, File, Move'
              Move tagged files (or the current file) similarly.

RENAMING A FILE
       As well as copying/moving files, you can rename them:

       `Ctrl-n'
       `Selector menu, File, Rename file'
              Rename the current file or directory --- xzgv will refuse to
              overwrite any existing files/directories. The new name must
              remain in the current directory. (See Copying/Moving Files, for
              how to move a file to a different directory (albeit keeping the
              same name).) See The Selector Menu, for how to choose the file
              renamed when using the mouse.  (Basically, you right-click on
              the file when popping up the menu.)

       I know `Ctrl-n' isn't the most mnemonic keypress possible for `rename',
       but all the good ones were taken. :-/

DELETING A FILE
       Deleting a file is pretty straightforward:

       `Ctrl-d'
       `Selector menu, File, Delete file'
              Delete the file pointed to by the keyboard cursor (and any
              accompanying thumbnail). See The Selector Menu, for how to
              choose the file deleted when using the mouse. (Basically, you
              right-click on the file when popping up the menu.)

       Note that only one file is deleted (hence `Delete file'); there is
       currently no way to delete all tagged files.

CHANGING DIRECTORY
       The easiest way to change the current directory in xzgv is usually to
       click on a directory entry in the file list (or move the cursor to it
       and press `Enter'). Selecting the `..' entry moves to the parent
       directory of the current one.

       There is an alternative though:

       (Note that the key for this command is shift-`g', not `g'.)

       `G'
       `Selector menu, Directory, Change'
              Go to a specified directory. xzgv asks for the destination
              directory using a dialog box which you should type the dir's
              name into (see Dialog Boxes), and moves to that directory if it
              exists.

RESCANNING THE DIRECTORY
       Normally, xzgv reads a directory once (on starting up, or when a new
       directory is selected). So if the contents of the directory are changed
       by another program, this is not automatically reflected. You can,
       however, explicitly tell xzgv to `rescan' the directory (reread the
       contents), which will update xzgv's notion of what's in it:

       `Ctrl-r'
       `Selector menu, Directory, Rescan'
              Rescan the current directory.

CHANGING THE SORTING ORDER
       Normally, the files are listed in asciibetical order by name. However,
       you can instead have the file list sorted by size, last-modified
       date/time, or by `extension' (the file type).

       (Only the order of files can be altered; directories are always listed
       first, and always in name order.)

       `Alt-n'
       `Selector menu, Directory, Sort by Name'
              Sort by name. This is the default.

       `Alt-e'
       `Selector menu, Directory, Sort by Extension'
              Sort by extension.

       `Alt-s'
       `Selector menu, Directory, Sort by Size'
              Sort by size. The biggest files are listed last.

       `Alt-d'
       `Selector menu, Directory, Sort by Time & Date'
              Sort by time/date. The newest files are listed last.

       You can set the default sort order via the command-line (see Invoking
       xzgv) or a config file (see Configuring xzgv).

       There are three possible timestamps you can use for the `Time & Date'
       sorting order:

       `Alt-Shift-m'
       `Selector menu, Directory, Time & Date Type, Modification Time (mtime)'
              Use the last-modified time (`mtime'). This is the default.

       `Alt-Shift-c'
       `Selector menu, Directory, Time & Date Type, Attribute Change Time
       (ctime)'
              Use the last-attribute-change time (`ctime'). Note that this is
              not always the time the file was created, which it's sometimes
              mistaken for; for example, moving a file with `mv' will usually
              change the ctime.

       `Alt-Shift-a'
       `Selector menu, Directory, Time & Date Type, Access Time (atime)'
              Use the last-accessed time (`mtime'). The selector order is not
              automatically updated when xzgv reads files, since this would
              probably be annoying; do a manual rescan if need be.

FILE SELECTOR OPTIONS
       Various aspects of the file selector's behaviour can be configured
       while xzgv is running, by using these toggle commands (which enable the
       feature if it was previously disabled, and vice versa).

       These settings can also be altered using command-line options (see
       Options) and/or config file settings (see Configuring xzgv).

       `Alt-a'
       `Selector menu, Options, Auto Hide'
              Toggle the auto-hiding of the selector when a picture is viewed
              (off by default). This is handy for small screens/windows, or
              for old-time zgv users who just dig that groovy modal interface,
              er, man. :-)

       `Alt-b'
       `Selector menu, Options, Status Bar'
              Toggle status bar at the bottom of the selector (off by
              default). This displays messages in certain circumstances ---
              normally, it just says when a picture is being read.

       `Selector menu, Options, Thumbnail Msgs'
              Toggle reading-thumbnails messages (default is off), only
              visible if the status bar is enabled. These messages make it
              clear when all thumbnails have been read, but having something
              flash up every time you change directory is generally just
              annoying.

       `v'
       `Selector menu, Options, Thin Rows'
              Toggle `thin rows' mode (off by default), in which thumbnails
              are shown at a third their normal size so that many more files
              can be shown at once. (The odd keyboard shortcut for this is
              inherited from zgv's `visual' mode toggle, which had a roughly
              similar effect.)

       `Alt-i'
       `Selector menu, Directory, Images Only'
              Toggle the option to show only directories and image files in
              the selector (off by default). This is handy in directories
              where images and other file types are intermingled and you want
              to avoid the by their extensions.

THE VIEWER
       Once you've selected a file to view, it's shown in the viewer (the
       right-hand part of xzgv's window). This section describes what you can
       do while viewing the picture.

       Like the selector, the viewer has its own menu --- right-click anywhere
       on the viewer (or press `F10' or `Menu') to show it --- and a similar
       help menu (see The Selector Menu).

EXITING THE VIEWER
       When using the mouse to control xzgv, it doesn't matter whether the
       selector or the viewer has keyboard focus --- mouse operations
       transcend such petty boundaries. :-) But keyboard control is (of
       necessity) effectively modal, and so you need to `exit' the viewer in
       order to have keyboard control over the selector again. You also need
       to exit the viewer if you've enabled auto-hide mode.

       Exiting the viewer is simple:

       `Esc'
       `Tab'
       `Viewer menu, Exit to Selector'
              Exit the viewer. This also returns the selector to its former
              size, if it was previously `hidden'.

       Another way of exiting the viewer is to middle-click on it, but this
       mouse-only approach is really only of use when the selector is
       `hidden'.

BIG PICTURES
       A picture may well be too large to fit entirely in the viewer window.
       There are two main things which can help you see more of the picture at
       once:

       - Make the xzgv window larger. You could `maximize' it with your window
       manager, or you could start xzgv with a larger window using
       `--geometry' or fullscreen mode (see Options). The fullscreen mode
       gives xzgv the maximum window size possible, but needs co-operation
       from your window manager (and alas, many are not as willing as one
       might like) --- in some cases you may even find `--geometry 100%x100%'
       to be more effective.

       - Hide the selector. To do this, either use auto-hide mode (see File
       Selector Options), or hide the selector explicitly (see Hiding the
       Selector).

       But of course, these are only partial solutions to the problem; there
       will inevitably always be pictures larger than your screen can show at
       once. In general, then, there are two ways to see the whole of the
       picture.

   Scrolling
       Scrolling is the default approach to handling big pictures in xzgv.
       When the viewer is started up, the top-left of the picture is shown ---
       you can either drag the picture around with the mouse (i.e. click and
       hold the button down, then move the mouse around), or use the
       scrollbars, or use the cursor keys (and others) to move around the rest
       of the picture:

       `Cursor Up'
       `K'
              Move up 100 pixels. `Ctrl-Cursor Up' and `k' both move up 10
              pixels.

       `Cursor Down'
       `J'
              Move down 100 pixels. `Ctrl-Cursor Down' and `j' both move down
              10 pixels.

       `Cursor Left'
       `H'
              Move left 100 pixels. `Ctrl-Cursor Left' and `h' both move left
              10 pixels.

       `Cursor Right'
       `L'
              Move right 100 pixels. `Ctrl-Cursor Right' and `l' both move
              right 10 pixels.

       `Page Up'
       `Shift-Cursor Up'
       `Ctrl-u'
              Move up (nearly) the window height. (It moves by 90% of the
              height.)

       `Page Down'
       `Shift-Cursor Down'
       `Ctrl-v'
              Move down (nearly) the window height.

       `-'
       `Shift-Cursor Left'
              Move left (nearly) a window-length. (It moves by 90% of it.)

       `='
       `Shift-Cursor Right'
              Move right (nearly) a window-length.

       `Home'
       `Ctrl-a'
              Move to the top-left of the picture.

       `End'
       `Ctrl-e'
              Move to the bottom-right of the picture.

   Zoom Mode
       An alternative way of viewing the whole picture, one which lets you see
       the picture onscreen all at once no matter how big (or small) it is, is
       zoom mode.

       Zoom mode's name derives from the idea of `zooming' a small file up to
       fit the window. But in reality, it is more often used to reduce a large
       file to fit.

       Zoom mode is not the default, and has to be enabled. Once enabled, it
       stays on until you turn it off again (or until you enable scaling, or
       select Normal (see Scaling)).

       `z'
       `Viewer menu, Options, Zoom (fit to window)'
              Toggle zoom mode.

       `Alt-r'
       `Viewer menu, Options, When Zooming Reduce Only'
              When in zoom mode, only reduce pictures to fit. This can be
              useful when going through a lot of unpredictably-sized pictures,
              as it means that you can see all of a big picture easily without
              also meaning that tiny little icons assume a scale of Biblical
              proportions. :-)

       `Alt-p'
       `Viewer menu, Options, When Zooming Panorama'
              When in zoom mode, resize to make the most proportional
              dimension fit and allow scrolling on the other dimension. This
              can be useful when viewing iamges that do not adjust nicely to
              the window size but you want to see them as big as possible
              while using the most space available. The cause for this
              function was to better read comics, so you can guess it works
              like a

       The way zoom mode reduces a file to fit the window is (relatively)
       quick but harsh, and may make the picture look a bit ugly. In future
       there may be a smoothing option like zgv's vkludge, but for now I'm
       afraid the fairly crude resize is all that's available.

       There is in fact an alternative to zoom mode, as you can scale down an
       image instead. This is generally only useful for very large images,
       however; zoom mode tends to be the Right Thing for the most part.

SCALING
       You can scale a picture --- this makes it appear larger (or smaller)
       onscreen. xzgv acts much as if the scaled picture were the real
       picture; for example, the cursor keys scroll around in steps of 100
       scaled pixels, even if this means moving a fraction of a pixel (or many
       pixels) in the original picture (and similarly for movement with the
       mouse).

       The main limitation of scaling (other than how much it slows things
       down :-), at least when scaling up) is that you can only scale by
       integer values, so you can only make each pixel in the image twice as
       wide/high, or three times as wide/high, or four times, and so on.

       (It may seem odd saying e.g. `twice as wide/high' rather than `twice
       the size', but technically `twice the size' would be referring to
       scaling up the width (and height) by about 1.414...)

       Normally, xzgv does no scaling, which could be considered a ratio of
       1:1.  Scaling up increases that ratio. How it is increased depends on
       which option/key you use:

       `d'
       `Viewer menu, Scaling, Double Scaling'
              Increase the ratio by doubling it --- this leads to ratios of
              2:1, 4:1, 8:1...

       `s'
       `Viewer menu, Scaling, Add 1 to Scaling'
              Increase the ratio by adding one --- leads to ratios of 2:1,
              3:1, 4:1...

       There are similar commands to decrease the ratio:

       `D (Shift-d)'
       `Viewer menu, Scaling, Halve Scaling'
              Decrease the ratio by halving it.

       `S (Shift-s)'
       `Viewer menu, Scaling, Sub 1 from Scaling'
              Decrease the ratio by subtracting one.

       Usually the double/halve scalings are more useful.

       Note that you can also double/halve the scaling by using shift-left-
       click on the viewer to double, and shift-right-click to halve. This
       still changes scale `around' the middle of the window though (rather
       than around the point clicked on, as you might expect), which is a
       little strange and may possibly be changed in future.

       When you scale `below' 1:1, the above commands lead to ratios of (e.g.)
       1:2, 1:4, 1:8, etc. --- that is, the ratios work the same way, but the
       other way around. This gives you an increasingly small image.

       The scaling ratio is never decreased below 1:32. It is also never
       increased beyond the point where the overall image size would exceed
       32767x32767 --- this limit is due to the combination of X's limit on
       window sizes, and the implementation used by xzgv for scaling.

       One problem with scaling up, given the way it's currently implemented,
       is that it's not well-suited to dithered display --- so if you're
       running on an 8-bit server, dragging the image around slowly when using
       scaling (especially scaling with interpolation) may result in some
       nasty, streaky, undithered-looking parts of the picture. :-(

       You can undo the effect of scaling (up or down) at any time:

       `n'
       `Viewer menu, Scaling, Normal'
              Resume `normal' display --- disables scaling mode, and also zoom
              mode.

       Normally, scaling up works by simply making the pixels into larger and
       larger squares (in effect), which remain the same colour. However, you
       can enable a feature called `interpolation' which smoothly graduates
       the colour change between the top-left corners of each pixel. This is
       very slow, but looks nice.

       `i'
       `Viewer menu, Options, Interpolate when Scaling'
              Toggle interpolation in scaling mode.

       (If you like the appearance of scaling with interpolation, you may also
       be interested in a program I wrote called pnminterp, which can scale up
       a PGM or PPM file while applying this effect. These days it's part of
       the netpbm package.)

       Scaling down, however, is implemented a bit like a special-case zoom
       mode, and currently there are no ways of making that look nicer. :-/

       xzgv normally `reverts' scaling (returning the scale to 1:1) back to
       normal when you view a new picture. However, it's possible to disable
       this behaviour (see Viewer Options).

       There is also support for an alternative form of scaling --- decoupled,
       or axis-specific, scaling. When you scale in this way, only one axis of
       the image is scaled at once. For example, you might choose to
       effectively double the height of an image (with the width left
       unchanged). Indeed, this sort of scaling is useful for temporarily
       correcting pictures intended for display using pixels twice as wide or
       high as normal.

       `x'
       `Viewer menu, Scaling, X Only, Double Scaling'
              Increase the (x axis) ratio by doubling it.

       `X (Shift-x)'
       `Viewer menu, Scaling, X Only, Halve Scaling'
              Decrease the (x axis) ratio by halving it.

       `Alt-x'
       `Viewer menu, Scaling, X Only, Add 1 to Scaling'
              Increase the (x axis) ratio by adding one.

       `Alt-Shift-x'
       `Viewer menu, Scaling, X Only, Sub 1 from Scaling'
              Decrease the (x axis) ratio by subtracting one.

       `y'
       `Viewer menu, Scaling, Y Only, Double Scaling'
              Increase the (y axis) ratio by doubling it.

       `Y (Shift-y)'
       `Viewer menu, Scaling, Y Only, Halve Scaling'
              Decrease the (y axis) ratio by halving it.

       `Alt-y'
       `Viewer menu, Scaling, Y Only, Add 1 to Scaling'
              Increase the (y axis) ratio by adding one.

       `Alt-Shift-y'
       `Viewer menu, Scaling, Y Only, Sub 1 from Scaling'
              Decrease the (y axis) ratio by subtracting one.

       There are also mouse shortcuts for scaling up/down a single axis;
       control-left-click scales up, and control-right-click scales down. By
       default this acts on the y axis, but the active axis can be toggled
       with `Alt-c', or by toggling the `Ctl+Click Scales X Axis' option (see
       Viewer Options).

       Interpolation is not currently supported in situations where the x
       scaling does not match the y scaling.

MIRROR AND ROTATE
       Sometimes when viewing a picture you will want to flip it horizontally
       or vertically, or rotate it:

       `m'
       `Viewer menu, Orientation, Mirror (horiz)'
              `Mirror' the picture (flip it horizontally).

       `f'
       `Viewer menu, Orientation, Flip (vert)'
              `Flip' the picture (flip it vertically).

       `r'
       `Viewer menu, Orientation, Rotate Right'
              Rotate the picture 90 degrees clockwise.

       `R (Shift-r)'
       `Viewer menu, Orientation, Rotate Left'
              Rotate the picture 90 degrees anti-clockwise. (Any US readers
              surprised and/or annoyed by my not saying `counter-clockwise'
              will realise why the menus say rotate right/left. :-))

       `N (Shift-n)'
       `Viewer menu, Orientation, Normal'
              Restore the picture orientation to normal. This undoes the
              effect of any mirrors, flips, and/or rotations.

       xzgv normally `reverts' the picture orientation (the way the picture
       has been transformed by mirror/flip/rotate) back to normal when you
       view a new picture. However, it's possible to disable this (see Viewer
       Options), so that any new pictures are mirrored, flipped, and/or
       rotated in the same way.

CHANGING PICTURE
       It's possible to go directly to the previous or next file (or tagged
       file) in the directory, or to tag a file, without having to pick the
       file from the file selector by hand. These commands are particularly
       useful when using xzgv from the keyboard, but there's also a notable
       mouse shortcut for moving to the next image.

       `Space'
       `Viewer menu, Next Image'
              Move to next file in dir, and view it. You can also click on the
              picture/viewer to do this. (If you find this interferes with
              dragging the picture around (though it shouldn't), or just don't
              like it, it can be disabled (see Config Variables).)

       `b'
       `Viewer menu, Previous Image'
              Move to previous file in dir, and view it.

       `Ctrl-Space'
       `Viewer menu, Tagging, Tag then Next'
              Tag current file, then move to next file in dir and view it.

       `/'
       `Viewer menu, Tagging, Next Tagged'
              Move to next tagged file in dir, and view it.

       `?'
       `Viewer menu, Tagging, Previous Tagged'
              Move to previous tagged file in dir, and view it.

HIDING THE SELECTOR
       When running on small screens, or in a small window, it can get a bit
       annoying to lose viewer space by having the selector constantly
       displayed when you don't actually need it. The usual solution to this
       problem is to enable auto-hide mode. But what if some pictures you're
       viewing are small and some large? It can sometimes be nearly as
       annoying having the selector hidden to `make room for' a small picture
       which didn't need it. So for that reason, or perhaps if you just don't
       like auto-hide mode :-), you may prefer to leave auto-hide off and
       explicitly hide the selector when necessary:

       `Z (shift-z)'
       `Viewer menu, Window, Hide Selector'
              Hide the selector. (This is actually a toggle, of sorts; `hide
              selector' when it's already hidden unhides it.)

       You can also hide or unhide the selector by middle-clicking on the
       viewer.

MINIMIZING XZGV
       Generally it's easy enough to use your window manager to change windows
       etc., but when running fullscreen this can sometimes be a little
       problematic. For this reason, xzgv has built-in support for
       `iconifying' itself:

       `Ctrl-z'
       `Viewer menu, Window, Minimize'
              Minimize the xzgv window.

VIEWER OPTIONS
       As with the selector, various options can be disabled/enabled which
       relate to the viewer.

       These settings can also be altered using command-line options (see
       Options) and/or config file settings (see Configuring xzgv).

       `z'
       `Viewer menu, Options, Zoom (fit to window)'
              Toggle zoom mode, discussed in more detail elsewhere (see Zoom
              Mode).

       `Alt-r'
       `Viewer menu, Options, When Zooming Reduce Only'
              Toggle reduce-only in zoom mode, also covered elsewhere (see
              Zoom Mode).

       `Alt-p'
       `Viewer menu, Options, When Zooming Panorama'
              Toggle panorama view in zoom mode, also covered elsewhere (see
              Zoom Mode).

       `i'
       `Viewer menu, Options, Interpolate when Scaling'
              Toggle interpolation when a picture is being scaled-up. Again,
              this has already been mentioned (see Scaling).

       `Alt-c'
       `Viewer menu, Options, Ctl+Click Scales X Axis'
              Toggle the axis scaled when you control-click (or control-right-
              click) on the image. The default is to scale the y axis.

       `F (shift-f)'
       `Viewer menu, Options, Dither in 15 & 16-bit'
              Toggle dithering in 15/16-bit modes. This increases the apparent
              colour depth making gradations look much better, but it's slower
              than undithered rendering, and can (in 16-bit) slightly distort
              a picture's colour balance. (The `F' key was chosen for this as
              the dither toggle is functionally similar to zgv's `fakecols'
              toggle.)

       `Viewer menu, Options, Revert Scaling For New Pic'
              Normally xzgv returns the scaling back down to 1 (normal) when a
              new picture is selected. By disabling this, you can retain
              scaling across picture selection. (There is currently no
              keyboard shortcut for this fairly-seldom-changed option --- to
              toggle it from the keyboard, you should use the popup menu
              (press `F10'), and select the menu item.)

       `Viewer menu, Options, Revert Orient. For New Pic'
              Similarly, xzgv returns to the picture's true orientation (not
              mirrored, rotated, etc.) on selecting a new picture. Disabling
              this option means that any mirrors/flips/rotates applied persist
              across multiple images.  (No keyboard shortcut --- see above.)

       `Viewer menu, Options, Use Exif Orientation'
              Toggle support for Exif orientation. Devices which create JPEG
              files in the Exif format (e.g. many digital cameras) may add an
              orientation tag to the file, which says how the camera was being
              held when the picture was taken. When this tag is present, xzgv
              can adjust the image to compensate for a camera being held on
              its side. (This isn't done by default as it misrepresents the
              true image, which could be confusing if you don't know why it's
              happening.) Enabling this option may be useful if you take
              pictures with your camera on its side, but don't want to have to
              rotate the pictures before being able to view them properly. Of
              course, for this to work your camera has to be inserting the
              orientation tag in the first place --- but it can't hurt to try
              it and see. (No keyboard shortcut --- see above.)

FILE FORMATS
       Picture files are stored in a variety of different forms, or `file
       formats'. xzgv, via gdk, supports many.

FILE TYPE IDENTIFICATION
       The format a file is in is identified by its content. The file-reading
       code relies on libgdk to determine the file type and read the file
       correctly; generally this uses the format's `magic number' to determine
       file type --- e.g. a JPEG/JFIF file starts with the (hex) bytes `FF
       D8'. So if you start xzgv with xzgv foo, and foo is in a supported
       format (such as JPEG), the format will be figured out and the file
       loaded even though the `extension' is absent.

CONFIGURING XZGV
       Many aspects of the way xzgv works can be modified by using a
       configuration file.

CONFIG FILES
       A configuration file lets you alter aspects of xzgv's behaviour. xzgv
       supports two possible config files --- a system-wide one,
       /etc/xzgv.conf; and one for each user in their home directory,
       $HOME/.xzgvrc. Both are optional. If $HOME/.xzgvrc exists, it is used
       instead of /etc/xzgv.conf.

       Before describing the format of config files, it may help to give an
       example file:

       # Sample xzgv config file
       # Comment lines begin with `#' and are ignored,
       #  as are blank lines.

       # make pics fit window
       zoom on
       # hog the screen :-)
       fullscreen on

       It is a line-based format. Each line (or rather, each line which is not
       a comment line and is not blank) assigns a value to a single predefined
       `variable'. xzgv has many such variables it lets you modify in this
       way.  For example, the fullscreen option above controls whether or not
       xzgv tries to use the whole screen for its window. If it is given the
       value `on'/`y'/`yes'/`1' it does; if `off'/`n'/`no'/`0', it doesn't.
       Most variables are of this yes-or-no `boolean' type.

       Since the variables set in a config file have a direct effect on how
       xzgv works, it can be easier to simply call them `settings'. Indeed,
       such terminology is used on occasion in this documentation.

CONFIG VARIABLE TYPES
       There are various types of variable:

       - Boolean. These are on-or-off, yes-or-no variables. Most of xzgv's
       config file variables are of this type.

       - Integer. These are whole numbers. The meaning of the number depends
       on what the variable is used for.

       - Geometry. This window size-and/or-position specification format is
       only used for the `geometry' setting. See Options, for a description of
       how this type works.

CONFIG VARIABLES
       Currently, most configuration variables (settings) in xzgv can also be
       set by command-line options; indeed, the name of the setting in all
       such cases is identical to that for the long version of the option
       (e.g. `fullscreen', `auto-hide'). As such, they're documented in the
       section which discusses command-line options and the like (see
       Options).

       However, there are some settings only available in the config file:

       click-for-next
              This is enabled by default, allowing you to click on the viewer
              to skip to the next image. If disabled, clicking on the viewer
              does nothing.

RATIONALE
       Here I (RJM) attempt to explain why I did things the way I did. This is
       presented in a question-and-answer format of sorts.

WHY YET ANOTHER VIEWER?
       Previously, this section concentrated on xv; that may have made sense
       when I originally wrote it, and still makes a certain limited amount of
       sense for zgv, but for xzgv it was looking increasingly dated. And so
       here I am writing an update. :-)

       I originally wrote xzgv as I simply wasn't happy with the viewers for X
       that I was aware of at the time (mid-1999). At the time of writing
       (late 2000), other key things about xzgv are becoming apparent, partly
       through responses I've been getting to it:

       o It's `fast'. No, it doesn't do any particular operation faster than
       other viewers as far as I know (well, maybe thumbnail updates :-));
       rather, the interface tries not to get in your way. Click on a
       filename, and the picture appears. No multiplicity of toolbars or
       windows, it's just there.

       o As with zgv, it tries to do one thing well, viewing pictures. It
       isn't perfect in this regard, I'll admit, but at least it stays well
       clear of picture editing.

       o It's, er, quite a lot like zgv. Some of us old fogies like this. :-)

       I won't pretend xzgv is The Ultimate Viewer For Everyone. Some people
       will prefer other approaches, or just simply prefer other viewers.
       (Some people may even still use xv, ghod forbid.) There are a few
       viewers which you may like to try if you don't think much of xzgv:

       o gqview. This seems to be well-regarded. I find it a bit gimmicky and
       kitchen-sink-ish; not quite as `pure' or focused as xzgv, IMHO. I think
       more people use it than xzgv though.

       o xli. I'm not sure if this is maintained these days, but it's not too
       bad a viewer. No thumbnails or file selector though. (These days I
       mostly use this for setting the root window pixmap, something I don't
       think belongs in a viewer, but which xli does happen to be quite good
       at.)

       o qiv. If I read between the lines correctly, this is essentially a
       modern replacement for xli.

       o gtksee. I've not tried this, but I think the idea is that it's an
       ACDSee clone, and there seem to be an awful lot of people who want a
       clone of that. Which is their problem. :^)

       o Electric Eyes. To be honest, I think this has been outclassed by
       other viewers these days, which shows how far we've come.

       Ah, you say, what of xv? Well, we've emphatically reached the point
       where no-one need use xv any more. Anyone using xv these days really
       should drop that pile of ill-conceived non-Free crap and use one of the
       better viewers now available. It's that simple.

WHY NO IMAGE-EDITING CAPABILITIES?
       It's a fscking viewer, dammit. If you want xv you know where to find
       it.

       (OTOH, if you want a decent image editor, use the Gimp.)

WHY A TEXINFO MANUAL?
       For years, I maintained a conventional `man page' for zgv (which xzgv
       was loosely based on). But over time, I realised just how impossibly
       confusing the zgv man page had become.

       So I wanted to rewrite zgv's documentation in a more sensible way, in
       some other format than a man page. I wanted an established, well-
       supported format with structure and cross-referencing. I felt this made
       it a choice between HTML and texinfo. HTML seemed to me to be a moving
       target like no other, and not as well supported on text-only terminals
       as Info (and thus texinfo). (This latter point is admittedly not too
       relevant as far as xzgv is concerned.) When I noticed that a converter
       existed to convert texinfo to HTML in any case, the case was closed.
       xzgv's documentation was then based on zgv's --- the documentation is
       probably more similar than the programs are. :-)

       Don't get me wrong --- I like man pages. And even with the excellent
       Texinfo documentation and Emacs' very helpful Texinfo mode, writing
       texinfo is hardly easy. (Without Texinfo mode's node- and menu-update
       commands, I personally would find it near-impossible!) But big man
       pages just aren't that good for reference, and this is made worse by
       the relative lack of structure.

WHY ONE-SPACE SENTENCE ENDS?
       The conventional way to write texinfo is to follow each sentence with
       two spaces after the dot (or whatever ends the sentence). Many people
       normally write this way in a non-texinfo context too. But a sizeable
       proportion of people normally write text with only one space after the
       dot --- and I'm one of them.

       The Texinfo documentation gives the impression that two-space must be
       used; it says ``it is important to put two spaces at the end of
       sentences in Texinfo documents.'' But the only circumstance in which
       spacing from the texinfo file is preserved at all (in any sense other
       than `there is a space here') is when the texinfo is converted to Info
       format. So, in fact, the decision to use two-space depends on how the
       author wants Info output to appear --- this is a subjective decision
       which should be entirely down to the preference of the author, despite
       the Texinfo documentation's attempt to make two-space sound like an
       objective you-must-do-this kind of thing.

       You might wonder what the problem with using one-space is, then. Well,
       `makeinfo' has to reformat paragraphs, and whenever it needs to insert
       space at (what appears to it to be) the end of a sentence, it inserts
       two spaces. This behaviour cannot be altered, unlike in Emacs
       (sentence-end-double-space; see Fill Commands in the emacs info file)
       and GNU fmt (-u; see fmt invocation in the textutils info file). Also,
       attempting to `fix' the output Info with sed doesn't work properly
       because the `tags' used to find nodes quickly are then incorrect. These
       could of course also be fixed, but this would involve a lot more work
       than a simple sed invocation.

       So realistically, anyone who writes texinfo with one-space has to put
       up with the occasional two-space sentence end being inserted into their
       text --- worse still, the current `makeinfo' formatting algorithm seems
       to insert two spaces even after abbreviations (such as `e.g.' and
       `etc.'), which breaks even two-space texinfo. (This is particularly
       ironic, by the way, since two-space partisans' main argument in favour
       of the practice is often the way it makes it possible to tell the
       difference between abbreviations and the end of a sentence.)

       One last point may be worth noting; I am not the first person to write
       texinfo files using one-space. At the time of writing, it is used in
       the texinfo documentation for BFD, gdbm, GTK/GDK, (Linux) IPC, and
       viper, and I expect there are instances I'm not aware of.

BUGS AND RESTRICTIONS
       All (non-trivial) programs have bugs. Anyone who denies this...

       - clearly hasn't written too many programs.

       - is wrong. ;-)

       It follows that xzgv, like everything else, always has some bugs.
       Usually these are not too serious, or I'd have fixed them before
       releasing xzgv. But either way, bugs and other problems with xzgv are
       noted here.

KNOWN BUGS
       - In zoom mode, it copes with resizing the window as a whole, but
       doesn't when you change the size of the pane (apart from when
       hiding/showing selector or resizing from keyboard, but that's only 'cos
       I kludged it :-)).

       - When scaling up and dithering, you end up with a crappy-looking
       picture if you drag the picture around slowly (since each exposed bit
       is dithered independently, with no regard given to matching up to any
       previous error-diffusion).

       - Scaling up is slow. Not sure if I can do much about this.

       - Using an alignment widget to centre the viewer window results in some
       annoying `bounce' in certain resizing situations etc.

       - Thumbnails don't look so great in palette-based (e.g. 8-bit) modes.

       - When dragging an image around, if you quickly move the mouse pointer
       over from the image area to the selector area, the image seems to
       `jump' a little. I think this may have something to do with the paned
       window's window-splitting bit, but I'm not sure. Also, it jumps when
       moving across scrollbar sliders and the paned window splitter handle.

       - It doesn't apply any tranparency mask. The practical result of this
       seems to be purple transparent bits in thumbnails and scaled-up images,
       and black transparent bits elsewhere. This doesn't affect PNG files,
       though.

       - If a GIF file is corrupted in such a way that the decompressed image
       has a larger number of pixels in it, the extra pixels will be ignored
       and no error or warning will be generated.

       - If you look up `joe code' in a dictionary, right next to ``see zgv''
       it now says ``but for really in-depth insight into the joe code nature,
       see xzgv''. :-)

SUBOPTIMAL FEATURES
       - Thumbnails are given an accurate width/height `IMGINFO' comment, but
       are always claimed to be "RGB".

       - xzgv doesn't duplicate zgv's behaviour of generating thumbnails under
       ~/.xvpics/_foo_bar_baz if it can't generate them in
       /foo/bar/baz/.xvpics. I doubt anything else supported it, and it
       complicated lots of things unnecessarily. This isn't particularly
       suboptimal, but as an incompatibility with zgv it merits mention.

RESTRICTIONS
       - Only the first image of a multiple-image GIF is used. (These days,
       multiple-image GIFs are usually animations.)

REPORTING BUGS
       If you find xzgv does something wrong, which you suspect might be a
       fault of some sort (a bug) in the program, it is best to report it as I
       may not be aware of the problem. (But first, check it is not a `known
       bug'.  See Known Bugs. It is not usually helpful to report a bug I
       already know about.)

       It is important to include as much detail in a bug report as you can.
       Here are some details you should include:

       o The version of xzgv you are running. `xzgv --version' reports this.

       o The versions of GTK+ you are using. `xzgv --version-gtk' reports the
       GTK+ version being used by xzgv.

       o The bitdepth your X server is running in (common depths are 16-bit,
       24-bit, and 32-bit). If you don't know what depth you're running in,
       try `xdpyinfo|grep depth'.

       o A description of the bug --- what effects it has, the circumstances
       it occurs in, and so on. Does it only happen for certain types of file?
       Only when in 8-bit modes? Only when dithering is enabled? Even
       `irrelevant' details can sometimes be useful.

       o Finally, if you are a programmer and believe you have managed to fix
       the bug yourself, patches are gratefully accepted. :-) You should
       generate the patch using `diff -c' or (preferably) `diff -u'.

       Then, please file a bug report in the SourceForge bug tracker.  See
       https://sourceforge.net/p/xzgv.

REPORTING DOCUMENTATION BUGS
       Bugs in the documentation can sometimes cause as much trouble as bugs
       in the program; if you notice a problem in the documentation, it's a
       good idea to report it.

       For reports of documentation bugs, you should include these details:

       o The version of xzgv the documentation is for.

       o If it is a problem in one specific section of the documentation,
       specify which part it is (by this I mean the heading it comes under;
       texinfophiles should read this as `the node name' :-)).

       o The format of the documentation you saw the problem in (e.g. info,
       man page, HTML).

       o A description of the problem.

FUTURE CHANGES
       See Reporting Bugs, for details of where to send the bug report.  If
       you want to suggest a feature you'd like in xzgv, or a change to an
       existing feature, contact me; see See Reporting Bugs for the address.

       Future changes etc. are listed in the TODO file.
