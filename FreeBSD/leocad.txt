NAME
       LeoCAD - CAD program for LEGO models.

SYNOPSIS
       leocad [OPTIONS] [INFILE]

DESCRIPTION
       LeoCAD  is a CAD program for creating virtual LEGO models. It has an
       easy to use interface and includes thousands of different parts in its
       library.


OPTIONS
       Below is a summary of all of the options that LeoCAD accepts. Many
       options have two equivalent names, one of which is a single letter
       preceded by -, and the other of which is a long name preceded by --.
       Brackets ([ and ]) indicate that an option takes an optional parameter.


       infile Loads the project file infile


       -l path, --libpath path
              Set the parts library location.


       -i [outfile.ext], --image [outfile.ext]
              Saves a picture to outfile.ext  in the image format specified by
              ext and exits. If outfile is not given then the program will use
              a name based on infile. The file format is selected by ext and
              can be gif, bmp, png or jpg (if ext is not present then the
              default preferences format will be used).


       -w width, --width width

       -h height, --height height
              Sets the height of the picture to height.


       -f time, --from time

              2=Outline Logo, 3=Sharp Top Logo, 4=Rounded Top Logo,
              5=Flattened Logo, 6=High Contrast, 7=High Contrast with Logo.


       --viewpoint front | back | left | right | top | bottom | home
              Sets the viewpoint to one of the predefined view angles.

              Set the camera angles in degrees around the model.


       --camera-position x y z  tx ty tz  ux uy uz
              Set the camera position, target and up vector using the LeoCAD
              coordinate system.


       --camera-position-ldraw x y z  tx ty tz  ux uy uz
              Set the camera position, target and up vector using the LDraw

       --no-fade-steps
              Do not render parts from prior steps faded.


       --fade-steps-color color
              Color to use for rendering faded parts. (#AARRGGBB where AA, RR,
              GG, and BB are hexadecimal values for alpha, red, green, and
              blue respectively.)


       --highlight
              Highlight parts in the steps they appear.

EXAMPLES
        $ leocad car.lcd -i car.png -w 640 -h 480

       This will start LeoCAD, load the file "car.lcd," create a png called
       "car.png" with a resolution of 640x480 and exit when done.
