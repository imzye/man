Dancer2::Logger::LogReport(3)              User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Dancer2::Logger::LogReport - reroute Dancer2 logs into Log::Report

INHERITANCE
        Dancer2::Logger::LogReport
          is a Moo::Object

SYNOPSIS
         # This module is loaded when configured.  It does not provide
         # end-user functions or methods.

         # See DETAILS

DESCRIPTION
       [The Dancer2 plugin was contributed by Andrew Beverley]

       This logger allows the use of the many logging backends available in
       Log::Report.  It will process all of the Dancer2 log messages, and also
       allow any other module to use the same logging facilities. The same log
       messages can be sent to multiple destinations at the same time via
       flexible dispatchers.

       If using this logger, you may also want to use
       Dancer2::Plugin::LogReport

       Many log back-ends, like syslog, have more levels of system messages.
       Modules who explicitly load this module can use the missing "assert",
       "notice", "panic", and "alert" log levels.  The "trace" name is
       provided as well: when you are debugging, you add a 'trace' to your
       program... it's just a better name than 'debug'. You will need to load
       Log::Report in order to use the additional levels; if doing so directly
       within a Dancer2 application (not a sub-module), then you will either
       need to load Log::Report with "syntax, 'LONG'" or use
       Dancer2::Plugin::LogReport to prevent namespace clashes.

   Log Format
       If using this module on its own (such as a drop-in replacement for
       Dancer2::Logger::Syslog), then the logging format is configured as with
       any other Dancer logger. If using this module with
       Dancer2::Plugin::LogReport, then log_format is ignored and messages are
       not formatted, in order to keep the message format consistent
       regardless of where the message was generated (be it another module
       using Log::Report, the plugin, or Dancer itself). In this case, the log
       format should be configured using the applicable dispatcher (such as
       Log::Report::Dispatcher::Syslog::new(format)).

       If also using with the Log::Report logging functions, then you probably
       want to set a very simple "logger_format", because the dispatchers do
       already add some of the fields that the default "simple" format adds.
       For instance, to get the filename/line-number in messages depends on
       the dispatcher 'mode' (f.i.  'DEBUG').

       You also want to set the Dancer2 log level to "debug", because level
       filtering is controlled per dispatcher (as well).

       See "DETAILS" in Dancer2::Plugin::LogReport for examples.
