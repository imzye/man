ExplicateUTF8(1)        FreeBSD General Commands Manual       ExplicateUTF8(1)

NAME
       ExplicateUTF8 - Explain the status of a sequence of bytes as a UTF8
       encoding

SYNOPSIS
       ExplicateUTF8 ((-o <byte offset>) <file name>)

DESCRIPTION
       ExplicateUTF8 examines its input and determines whether it begins with
       a valid UTF8 Unicode sequence. If the sequence is invalid, it explains
       why. If the sequence is valid, it explains why the sequence is valid,
       gives the equivalent UTF-32 code, and explains how this value was
       computed.

       If no input file name is supplied, ExplicateUTF8 reads from the
       standard input.

COMMAND LINE FLAGS
       -h     Print usage message.

       -o <byte offset>
              Skip the first <byte offset> bytes of the input.

       -v     Print version information.
