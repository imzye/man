LZIP(1)                          User Commands                         LZIP(1)

NAME
       lzip - reduces the size of files

SYNOPSIS
       lzip [options] [files]

DESCRIPTION
       Lzip is a lossless data compressor with a user interface similar to the
       one of gzip or bzip2. Lzip uses a simplified form of LZMA
       (Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain-Algorithm) designed to achieve complete
       interoperability between implementations. The maximum dictionary size
       is 512 MiB so that any lzip file can be decompressed on 32-bit
       machines. Lzip provides accurate and robust 3-factor integrity
       checking. 'lzip -0' compresses about as fast as gzip, while 'lzip -9'
       compresses most files more than bzip2. Decompression speed is
       intermediate between gzip and bzip2. Lzip provides better data recovery
       capabilities than gzip and bzip2. Lzip has been designed, written, and
       tested with great care to replace gzip and bzip2 as general-purpose
       compressed format for Unix-like systems.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help

              write to standard output, keep input files

       -d, --decompress
              decompress, test compressed file integrity

       -f, --force
              overwrite existing output files

       -F, --recompress
              force re-compression of compressed files

       -k, --keep
              keep (don't delete) input files

       -l, --list
              print (un)compressed file sizes

       -m, --match-length=<bytes>
              set match length limit in bytes [36]

       -o, --output=<file>
              write to <file>, keep input files

       -q, --quiet
              suppress all messages

       -s, --dictionary-size=<bytes>
              set dictionary size limit in bytes [8 MiB]

       -S, --volume-size=<bytes>
              set volume size limit in bytes

       -t, --test
              test compressed file integrity

       -v, --verbose
              be verbose (a 2nd -v gives more)

       -0 .. -9
              set compression level [default 6]

       --fast alias for -0

       --best alias for -9

       --loose-trailing
              allow trailing data seeming corrupt header

       If no file names are given, or if a file is '-', lzip compresses or
       decompresses from standard input to standard output.  Numbers may be
       followed by a multiplier: k = kB = 10^3 = 1000, Ki = KiB = 2^10 = 1024,
       M = 10^6, Mi = 2^20, G = 10^9, Gi = 2^30, etc...  Dictionary sizes 12
       to 29 are interpreted as powers of two, meaning 2^12 to 2^29 bytes.

       The bidimensional parameter space of LZMA can't be mapped to a linear
       scale optimal for all files. If your files are large, very repetitive,
       etc, you may need to use the options --dictionary-size and
       --match-length directly to achieve optimal performance.

       To extract all the files from archive 'foo.tar.lz', use the commands
       'tar -xf foo.tar.lz' or 'lzip -cd foo.tar.lz | tar -xf -'.

       Exit status: 0 for a normal exit, 1 for environmental problems (file
       not found, invalid command-line options, I/O errors, etc), 2 to
       indicate a corrupt or invalid input file, 3 for an internal consistency
       error (e.g., bug) which caused lzip to panic.

       The ideas embodied in lzip are due to (at least) the following people:
       Abraham Lempel and Jacob Ziv (for the LZ algorithm), Andrei Markov (for
       the definition of Markov chains), G.N.N. Martin (for the definition of
       range encoding), Igor Pavlov (for putting all the above together in
       LZMA), and Julian Seward (for bzip2's CLI).
