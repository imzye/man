DOVEADM-SIEVE(1)                  Pigeonhole                  DOVEADM-SIEVE(1)

NAME
       doveadm-sieve - Commands related to handling Sieve scripts

SYNOPSIS
       doveadm [-Dv] [-f formatter] sieve_cmd [options] [arguments]

DESCRIPTION
       The doveadm sieve commands are part of the Pigeonhole Project
       (pigeonhole(7)), which adds Sieve (RFC 5228) and ManageSieve (RFC 5804)
       support to the Dovecot secure IMAP and POP3 server (dovecot(1)). The
       doveadm sieve commands can be used to manage Sieve filtering.

OPTIONS
       Global doveadm(1) options:

       -D     Enables verbosity and debug messages.

       -f formatter
              Specifies the formatter for formatting the output.  Supported
              formatters are:

              flow   prints each line with key=value pairs.

              pager  prints each key: value pair on its own line and separates
                     records with form feed character (^L).

              tab    prints a table header followed by tab separated value
                     lines.

              table  prints a table header followed by adjusted value lines.

       -o setting=value
              Overrides the configuration setting from
              /usr/local/etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf and from the userdb with the
              given value.  In order to override multiple settings, the -o
              option may be specified multiple times.

       -v     Enables verbosity, including progress counter.

       Command specific options:

       -A     If the -A option is present, the command will be performed for
              all users.  Using this option in combination with system users
              from userdb { driver = passwd } is not recommended, because it
              contains also users with a lower UID than the one configured
              with the first_valid_uid setting.

              When the SQL userdb module is used make sure that the
              iterate_query setting in
              /usr/local/etc/dovecot/dovecot-sql.conf.ext matches your
              database layout.  When using the LDAP userdb module, make sure
              that the iterate_attrs and iterate_filter settings in
              /usr/local/etc/dovecot/dovecot-ldap.conf.ext match your LDAP
              schema.  Otherwise doveadm(1) will be unable to iterate over all
              users.

       -S socket_path
              The option's argument is either an absolute path to a local UNIX
              domain socket, or a hostname and port (hostname:port), in order
              to connect a remote host via a TCP socket.

              This allows an administrator to execute doveadm(1) mail commands
              through the given socket.

       -u user/mask
              Run the command only for the given user.  It's also possible to
              use '*' and '?' wildcards (e.g. -u *@example.org).
              When neither the -A option nor -u user was specified, the
              command will be executed with the environment of the currently
              logged in user.

ARGUMENTS
       scriptname
              Is the name of a Sieve_script, as visible to ManageSieve
              clients.

              NOTE: For Sieve scripts that are stored on disk, this is the
              filename without the ".sieve" extension.

COMMANDS
   sieve put
       doveadm sieve put [-A|-u user] [-S socket_path] [-a] scriptname

       This command puts one new Sieve script in the script storage. The
       script is read from standard input. If the script compiles
       successfully, it is stored under the provided scriptname_.  If the -a
       option is present, the Sieve script is subsequently marked as the
       active script for execution at delivery.

   sieve get
       doveadm sieve get [-A|-u user] [-S socket_path] scriptname

       This command retrieves the Sieve script named scriptname.

   sieve delete
       doveadm sieve delete [-A|-u user] [-S socket_path] [-a] scriptname_...

       This command deletes one or more Sieve scripts. The deleted script may
       not be the active script, unless the -a option is present.

   sieve list
       doveadm sieve list [-A|-u user] [-S socket_path] scriptname

       Use this command to get an overview of existing Sieve scripts.

   sieve rename
       doveadm sieve rename [-A|-u user] [-S socket_path] old_name new_name

       The sieve rename command is used to rename the Sieve script old_name to
       new_name.

   sieve activate
       doveadm sieve activate [-A|-u user] [-S socket_path] scriptname

       This command marks the Sieve script named scriptname as the active
       script for execution at delivery.

   sieve deactivate
       doveadm sieve deactivate [-A|-u user] [-S socket_path] scriptname

       This command deactivates Sieve processing.
