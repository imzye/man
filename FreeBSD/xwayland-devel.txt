XWAYLAND(1)             FreeBSD General Commands Manual            XWAYLAND(1)



NAME
       Xwayland - an X server for running X clients under Wayland.

SYNOPSIS
       Xwayland [option ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Xwayland is an X server and a Wayland client. It plays the role of a
       proxy between legacy X clients which do not support the Wayland
       protocols and the Wayland server.

       Usually, Xwayland is spawned automatically by the Wayland server and
       runs rootless so that X clients integrate seamlessly with the rest of
       the Wayland desktop. It is however possible for a user to launch
       Xwayland non-rootless, mainly for testing purposes.

       Like all of the X servers, Xwayland accepts the command line options
       described in the Xserver(7) manual page.  The following additional
       arguments are supported as well.

       -decorate
               Add decorations to the Xwayland root window when running
               rootful.

               This option has no effect when Xwayland is built without
               libdecor support (optional).

               This option is not compatible with rootless mode (-rootless).

       -eglstream
               Use EGLStream backend for NVidia GPUs. If Xwayland was compiled
               with EGLStream support, this option will instruct Xwayland to
               try that backend first, then fallback to the GBM backend if
               EGLStream is not supported by the Wayland server. Without this
               option, Xwayland tries the GBM backend first, and fallback to
               EGLStream if GBM is not usable.

       -fullscreen
               Set the Xwayland window fullscreen when running rootful.

               This option is not compatible with rootless mode (-rootless).

       -geometry WxH
               Sets the geometry of the Xwayland window to WxH when running
               rootful.

               This option is not compatible with rootless mode (-rootless).

       -host-grab
               Disable host keyboard shorcuts and confine the pointer when
               running rootful.

               This feature relies on the protocol for inhibiting the
               compositor keyboard shortcuts and on the protocol for pointer
               locking and confinement and may have no effect if the Wayland
               compositor in use does not support these protocols.

               Use the keys [CTRL]+[SHIFT] simultaneously to release the
               keyboard and pointer devices.

               This option is not compatible with rootless mode (-rootless).

       -initfd fd
               Add the given fd as a listen socket for initialization of X
               clients.  This options is aimed at Wayland servers which run
               Xwayland on-demand, to be able to spawn specific X clients
               which need to complete before other regular X clients can
               connect to Xwayland, like xrdb.

       -listen fd
               deprecated, use -listenfd instead.

       -listenfd fd
               Add given fd as a listen socket. This option is used by the
               Wayland server to pass Xwayland the socket where X clients
               connect.

       -noTouchPointerEmulation
               Disable touch pointer emulation. This allows the Wayland
               compositor to implement its own pointer emulation mechanism for
               X11 clients that don't support touch input.

       -force-xrandr-emulation
               Force additional non-native modes to be exposed when viewporter
               is not supported by the Wayland compositor.

       -rootless
               Run Xwayland rootless, so that X clients integrate seamlessly
               with Wayland clients in a Wayland desktop. That requires the
               Wayland server to be an X window manager as well.

       -shm    Force the shared memory backend instead of glamor (if
               available) for passing buffers to the Wayland server.

       -verbose [n]
               Sets the verbosity level for information printed on stderr.  If
               the n value isn't supplied, each occurrence of this option
               increments the verbosity level.  When the n value is supplied,
               the verbosity level is set to that value.  The default
               verbosity level is 0.

       -version
               Show the server version and exit.

       -wm fd  This option is used by the Wayland server to pass Xwayland the
               socket where the X window manager client connects, when
               Xwayland is running with -rootless.

ENVIRONMENT
       WAYLAND_DISPLAY
               the name of the display of the Wayland server.

       XWAYLAND_NO_GLAMOR
               disable glamor and DRI3 support in Xwayland, for testing
               purposes.
