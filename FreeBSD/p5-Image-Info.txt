Bundle::Image::Info::Everything(3)         User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Bundle::Image::Info::Everything - complete support for Image::Info

SYNOPSIS
        perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Image::Info::Everything'

CONTENTS
       Image::Info - the base Image::Info module

       Compress::Zlib - everything for PNG processing

       XML::LibXML::Reader - everything for SVG processing

       XML::Simple - everything for SVG processing

       Image::Xbm 1.07 - everything for XBM processing

       Image::Xpm 1.10 - everything for XPM processing

DESCRIPTION
       This bundle installs everything needed for Image::Info.

   SOURCE LIST
       The "CONTENTS" list is created by manually resolving all the contents
       in the following Bundle files:

       Bundle::Image::Info::PNG
       Bundle::Image::Info::SVG
       Bundle::Image::Info::XBM
       Bundle::Image::Info::XPM

       Unfortunately the CPAN module cannot cope with recursively defined
       Bundles, so this had to be done.
