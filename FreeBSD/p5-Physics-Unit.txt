NAME
       physics-unit - Helper script for the Physics::Unit Perl module

SYNOPSIS
         physics-unit meters            # Returns information about the unit 'meters'
         physics-unit -e                # Exports lists of units as HTML
         physics-unit --help/-h         # Shows a usage message

DESCRIPTION
       Physics::Unit is a Perl module for managing units and unit conversions.
       The "physics-unit" script retrieves unit and type information from the
       main module for reference purposes. Do not use this script from your
       code, use the Physics::Unit module instead. This script's interface is
       subject to change, the main module's API is much more stable.

OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS
         physics-unit [options] [name(s)|expression(s)]

         If reserved words, unit or type names, or unit expressions, are given on the
         command line, this prints a block of information for each to STDOUT.  The
         options -e, -t, and -u, on the other hand, cause comprehensive lists of
         data to be dumped from the unit library.

         -e
         --export
             Export a complete list of known units and types as HTML documents.
             Prints the names of the created files to STDOUT, this allows:
               firefox `physics-unit -e`

         -h
         --help
             Shows a usage message and exits. Overrides all other options.

         -t
         --types
             Print a list of types (one per line) to STDOUT.

         -u
         --units
             Print a list of units (one per line) to STDOUT.
