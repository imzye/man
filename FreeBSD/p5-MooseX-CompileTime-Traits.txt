NAME
       MooseX::CompileTime::Traits - Allow compile time traits for
       classes/roles

VERSION
       version 1.102570

SYNOPSIS
           role Bar(Int :$bar) { method bar { $bar + 2 } }
           role Baz(Int :$baz) { method baz { $baz + 4 } }

           class Foo with MooseX::CompileTime::Traits { }
           class Flarg with MooseX::CompileTime::Traits { }

           ...

           use Foo traits => [ Bar => { bar => 2 } ];
           use Flarg traits => [ Bar => { bar => 1 }, Baz => { baz => 1} ];

           Foo->new()->bar(); # 4
           my $flarg = Flarg->new();
           $flarg->bar(); # 3
           $flarg->baz(); # 5

DESCRIPTION
       MooseX::CompileTime::Traits allows role application at compile time via
       use statements. What this class does is provide an import method that
       will apply each of the roles (along with any arguments for
       parameterized roles).

       Roles and their arguments should be provided as an ArrayRef of tuples.

       Simply 'with' the role to gain the functionality

PUBLIC_METHODS
   import
           (ClassName $class: ArrayRef :$traits?)

       import is provided such that when your class or role is use'd it can
       take additional arguments that will be validatated and interpreted as
       roles or traits that need to be applied.
