NAME
       Shell::Source - run programs and inherit environment changes

SYNOPSIS
        use Shell::Source;
        my $csh = Shell::Source->new(shell => "csh", file => "stuff.csh");
        $csh->inherit;
        print STDERR $csh->output;
        print $csh->shell;

DESCRIPTION
       The Shell::Source allows arbitrary shell scripts, or other programs for
       that matter, to be run and their environment to be inherited into a
       Perl program.

       Begin by creating a Shell::Source object, and specifying the shell it
       will use.

       If the shell is unknown to the module, you will also need to specify
       how to run the shell in such a way that the output is a series of lines
       of the form NAME=value.  For example, to run a csh script:

        my $csh = Shell::Source->new(shell => "csh",
                                     file  => "stuff.csh",
                                     run   => "csh -f -c 'source [[file]]; env' |");

       However, for known shells this is not required.  Note that [[file]]
       will be replaced with the filename of the program you want to run.

       Output from running the program is returned from $csh->output.

       Changes made to the environment by running the program may be inherited
       by calling $csh->inherit.

       The environment changes are available as a hash from $csh->env, or in
       Bourne shell syntax from $csh->shell.

BUGS
       Huh?
