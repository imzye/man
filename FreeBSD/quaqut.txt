NAME
       quaqut - retrieves game information

SYNOPSIS
       quaqut [ -a | -s | -g | -y ] [ -p port ] [ -q port ] [ -t value ] [ -d
       value ] [ -f filename ] [ -r ] [ -v ] host

DESCRIPTION
       quaqut is a simple program that queries Unreal Tournament 2004 (TM)
       game servers and retrieves information like those available while
       browsing servers in the game. That means information like server name,
       game type and current map, names and scores of players, and much more.

OPTIONS
       -a     (DEFAULT) Request complete information, server/game/players.

       -s     Request only information about server.

       -g     Request only information about game.

       -y     Request only information about players.

       -p port
              Specify the game port of the server, useful for servers which
              listen on custom ports. If -p is not specified, the default port
              7777 is used.

       -q port
              Specify the query port of the server. Normally this option is
              not needed, since the query port is the one right after the game
              port (so by default it is 7778). Specifying a correct game port
              will suffice in most cases.

       -t value
              By default, quaqut will wait 10 tenths of second (one second)
              for server replies (their number is not always predictable).
              This value is normally a good choice. People with very slow or
              very fast connections (like those in LAN games) may like to
              fine-tune this value.  value is in tenths of second and must be
              a number between 1 and 999.

       -d value
              Activates daemon mode. Normally quaqut gets information,
              displays them and exits. In daemon mode, quaqut will keep
              running and will collect and display info at regular intervals.
              Interval duration is specified in seconds by value , it must be
              a number between 10 and 9999.

       -f filename
              Instead of printing information to stdout, quaqut writes them in
              the specified filename ; remember that new information are not
              appended to the file, it gets rewritten instead (this behaviour
              has been thought for daemon mode). In order to append new
              information to an existing file, simply use output redirection
              instead of this option.

       -r     Displays output in raw form. This means unformatted output, with
              each value on a single line. This comes handy for everyone
              wanting to parse the output within a frontend or web page.

       -v     Displays quaqut version and exits.
