BUGS
     Sometimes the onlykey-cli doesn't recognize that PIN has been entered and
     the OnlyKey in unlocked successfully.  In such case any command to the
     OnlyKey fails with an error 'OnlyKey is locked, enter PIN to unlock'.
     The workaround for such issue is to just retry one more time.
