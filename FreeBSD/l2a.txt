NAME
       l2a - a LaTeX detergent

SYNOPSIS
       l2a [ -a ] [ -h ] [ -n ] [ -v ]

DESCRIPTION
       L2a is a filter to ``detexify'' texts.  That is, it attempts to remove
       LaTeX markup commands, leaving only the body of text.  It is intended
       to be used when journal editors request plain ASCII text for
       typesetting, or when you want to post a plain version of a LaTeX
       document on an electronic conference system.

       L2a is a filter.  Its default operation is to read from standard input
       (the keyboard) and write on standard output (the terminal).

OPTIONS
       -a     Write out information about l2a.

       -h     Write out a brief summary of options.

       -n     Generate norwegian headings.

       -v     Display version number.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Unrecognized markup commands generate an error message on the screen.
       There is no return code.
