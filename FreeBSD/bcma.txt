BCMA(4)                FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                BCMA(4)

NAME
     bcma – Broadcom AMBA Backplane driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, add the following lines to the
     kernel configuration file:

           device bhnd
           device bcma

     To load the driver as a module at boot, add this line to loader.conf(5):

           bcma_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The bcma driver provides bhnd(4) support for devices using the ARM AMBA-
     based backplane architecture found in later Broadcom Home Networking
     Division's network chipsets and embedded systems.

     A common interconnect connects all of the backplane's functional blocks.
     These functional blocks, known as cores, use the ARM AMBA AXI or APB
     interface to communicate with devices attached to the interconnect.

     The IP cores used in siba(4) devices were adapted by Broadcom for
     compatibility with the new interconnect.

SEE ALSO
     bhnd(4), intro(4), siba(4)

HISTORY
     The bcma device driver first appeared in FreeBSD 11.0.

AUTHORS
     The bcma driver was written by Landon Fuller <landonf@FreeBSD.org>.
