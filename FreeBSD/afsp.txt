Name
       audio - TSP Audio Programs

Description
       The AFsp package provides several audio file utility programs and a
       library of routines for reading and writing audio files.

Audio File Utilities
           CompAudio
                Compare audio files, producing statistics and signal-to-noise
                ratio figures.
           CopyAudio
                Copy audio files.  This program combines samples from input
                audio files (an arbitrary linear combination) and writes them
                to the output file in a user selectable format.  One
                application is to provide format conversion for an audio file;
                another is to combine samples from multi-channel files.
           FiltAudio
                Filter audio files.  This program filters an audio file with
                an FIR, IIR or all-pole filter.  This program can be used with
                an appropriate filter for sample rate conversion.  The AFsp
                package includes a number of filter from the ITU-T Software
                Tool Library (G.191) in a form that can be used directly with
                the FiltAudio program.
           GenNoise
                Generate noise.  This program generates an audio file
                containing Gaussian white noise.
           GenTone
                Generate a sinusoid.  This program generates an audio file
                containing a sine wave of a given amplitude and frequency.
           InfoAudio
                Display information about an audio file.
           LPanal
                Demonstration program to do LPC analysis on a speech file.
           LPsyn
                Demonstration program to do LPC synthesis from a residual
                file.
           PWevalAudio
                Perceptual evaluation of audio quality.
           ResampAudio
                Resample data from an audio file.  This process involves
                interpolating between the samples in the original file to
                create a new sequence of samples with a new spacing (sampling
                rate).

Audio File Library Routines
       The audio file open routine automatically senses the input file type.
       The data format for the file is passed to the audio file reading
       routines.  The audio file reading routine does byte swapping and format
       conversion on the fly as the file is read.  The user sees float data
       without needing to worry about the underlying data format.

       Once a file is opened for writing, the user calls routines which take
       the user's float data and do byte swapping and format conversion of the
       data transparently.

       The library routines supplied in AFsp package form part of the libtsp
       signal processing library.  The AFsp routines are written in C and have
       been tested on Unix and Windows.
           AFclose
                Close an audio file
           AFopenRead
                Open an audio file for reading
           AFopenWrite
                Open an audio file for writing
           AFreadData
                Read data from an audio file (return float values)
           AFsetFileType
                Explicitly set the input audio file type
           AFsetInfo
                Set the audio file information string
           AFsetNHpar
                Set defaults for headerless audio files
           AFwriteData
                Write data to an audio file (float input values)
