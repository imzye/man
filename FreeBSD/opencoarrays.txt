CAF(1)                    caf compiler wrapper manual                   CAF(1)

NAME
       caf - OpenCoarrays compiler wrapper to compile and link coarray Fortran
       source files and programs

SYNOPSIS
       caf [compiler-options] [linker-options] <fortran-source-file>
       [object-files] [libraries]

DESCRIPTION
       caf is a compiler wrapper script which is generated when the
       OpenCoarrays library
       ⟨https://github.com/sourceryinstitute/OpenCoarrays#readme⟩ that ensures
       coarray fortran programs are compiled with the same fortran compiler
       OpenCoarrays was built for, gfortran(1) by default, and that the linker
       links against the appropriate parallel runtime, MPI by default. The caf
       compiler wrapper serves a similar purpose to the MPI fortran wrapper
       compiler, mpifort(1).  caf embeds the full path to the Fortran compiler
       it was built for, and to the parallel runtime libraries it links
       against, and a relative path, based on the install location of caf
       itself, to the OpenCoarrays library. This ensures that the API and ABI
       of OpenCoarrays is always consistent with the Fortran compiler it was
       built for, and the parallel runtime it uses. To upgrade the parallel
       runtime, e.g., MPI, or the Fortran compiler, you will need to rebuild
       and install OpenCoarrays, which will regenerate and reinstall the caf
       wrapper script.

       caf tries to be smart about how it calls the underlying compiler and
       linker. Any user specified libraries will be inserted before the
       OpenCoarrays library, libcaf_mpi, and before the parallel runtime
       libraries. This ensures that the linker will be able to resolve any
       references to the OpenCoarrays library and the parallel runtime library
       made by user supplied libraries. In addition any options not recognized
       by caf itself, as outlined below in the OPTIONS section. To see the
       default command caf will invoke, run caf --show. To see how caf would
       execute a specific command, i.e., perform a dry-run, pass the full
       command you wish to run, with the additional --show option as the very
       first option or argument after caf. (e.g., caf --show -c foo.f90 -o
       foo.f90.o or caf --show foo.f90.o bar.f90.o -lblas -o a.out)

OPTIONS
       --help, -h
              Print a brief help/usage message and return without performing
              any substantive action.

       --show, -s
              Print the default invocation of the underlying compiler,
              including what flags are passed, etc. This also functions as a
              dry-run for executing a specific command, showing the user how
              the compiler would be called with the additional files and
              arguments passed by the user.

       --version, -V, -v
              Print OpenCoarrays version and copyright information and exit.

       --wrapping, --wraps, -w
              Report the name and version of the Fortran compiler caf is
              wrapping and exit.
