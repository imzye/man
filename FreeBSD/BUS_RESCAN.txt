NAME
     BUS_RESCAN – rescan a bus checking for devices that have been added or
     removed

DESCRIPTION
     The BUS_RESCAN() method is called to request a rescan of the child
     devices on a bus device.  The method should add any devices that have
     been added since the previous scan and remove devices that have been
     removed.  This method is not required to re-examine existing devices to
     determine if their properties have changed.  This method is also not
     required to propagate the rescan request to child devices.
