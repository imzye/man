NAME
       Class::Mixin - API for aliasing methods to/from other classes

OVERVIEW
       Class::Mixin provides a way to mix methods from one class into another,
       such that the target class can use both its methods as well as those of
       the source class.

       The primary advantage is that the behavior of a class can be modified
       to effectively be another class without changing any of the calling
       code -- just requires using the new class that mixes into the original.

SYNOPSIS
         # class1.pm
         package class1;
         sub sub1 { return 11 };
         ...

         # class2.pm
         package class2;
         use Class::Mixin to=> 'class1';
         sub sub2 { return 22 };

         # Original calling code
         use class1;
         print class1->sub1;  # 11
         print class1->can('sub2');  # false

         # Updated calling code
         use class1;
         use class2;   # performs the mixing-in
         print class1->sub1;  # 11
         print class1->can('sub2');  # true
         print class1->sub2;  # 22  <-- note class1 now has the class2 method

METHODS
   import
       Method used when loading class to import symbols or perform some
       function.  In this case we take the calling classes methods and map
       them into the class passed in as a parameter.

       Input
         None
       Output
         None

   Destructor DESTROY
       This modules uses a destructor for un-mixing methods.  This is done in
       the case that this module is unloaded for some reason.  It will return
       modules to their original states.

       Input
         • Class::Mixin object

       Output
         None

   resync
       Function used to process registered 'mixins'.  Typically automatically
       called once immediately after program compilation.  Sometimes though
       you may want to call it manually if a modules is reloaded.

       Input
         None
       Output
         None
