NAME
       sak - Slicing and dicing of FASTA/FASTQ files..

SYNOPSIS
       sak [OPTIONS] [-o OUT.{fa,fq}] IN.{fa,fq}

DESCRIPTION
       "It slices, it dices and it makes the laundry!"

       Original SAK tool by David Weese. Rewrite by Manuel Holtgrewe.

REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
       IN INPUT_FILE
               Valid filetypes are: .sam, .raw, .gbk, .frn, .fq, .fna, .ffn,
              .fastq, .fasta, .faa, .fa, and .embl.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Display the help message.

       --version-check BOOL
              Turn this option off to disable version update notifications of
              the application.  One of 1, ON, TRUE, T, YES, 0, OFF, FALSE, F,
              and NO. Default: 1.

       --version
              Display version information.

   Output Options:
       -o, --out-path OUTPUT_FILE
              Path to the resulting file.  If omitted, result is printed to
              stdout in FastQ format. Valid filetypes are: .sam, .raw, .frn,
              .fq, .fna, .ffn, .fastq, .fasta, .faa, and .fa.

       -rc, --revcomp
              Reverse-complement output.

       -l, --max-length INTEGER
              Maximal number of sequence characters to write out.

   Filter Options:
       -s, --sequence List of INTEGER's
              Select the given sequence for extraction by 0-based index.

       -sn, --sequence-name List of STRING's
              Select sequence with name prefix being NAME.

       -ss, --sequences List of STRING's
              Select sequences from-to where from and to are 0-based indices.

       -i, --infix List of STRING's
              Select characters from-to where from and to are 0-based indices.

       -ll, --line-length INTEGER
              Set line length in output file.  See section Line Length for
              details. In range [-1..inf].

LINE LENGTH
       You can use the setting --line-length for setting the resulting line
       length.  By default, sequences in FASTA files are written with at most
       70 characters per line and sequences in FASTQ files are written without
       any line breaks.  The quality sequence in FASTQ file is written in the
       same way as the residue sequence.

       The default is selected with a --line-length value of -1 and line
       breaks can be disabled with a value of 0.

USAGE EXAMPLES
       sak -s 10 IN.fa
              Cut out 11th sequence from IN.fa and write to stdout as FASTA.

       sak -ss 10-12 -ss 100-200 IN.fq
              Cut out 11th up to and including 12th and 101th up to and
              including 199th sequence from IN.fq and write to stdout as
              FASTA.
