lxqt-openssh-askpass(1)           LXQt Module          lxqt-openssh-askpass(1)

NAME
       lxqt-openssh-askpass - Password access over ssh module of LXQt: the
       faster and lighter Qt Desktop Environment

SYNOPSIS
       lxqt-openssh-askpass [Currently No command line arguments]

DESCRIPTION
       This module handles openssh security password access for LXQt. The
       openssh askpass module, will perform security tasks over scale access
       privileges.

       The LXQt modules are desktop independent tools, and operate as daemons
       for the local user for desktop-specific operations.

       LXQt is an advanced, easy-to-use, and fast desktop environment based on
       Qt technologies, ships several core desktop components, all of which
       are optional:

        * Panel
        * Desktop
        * Application launcher
        * Settings center
        * Session handler
        * Polkit handler
        * SSH password access (this)
        * Display manager handler

       These components perform similar actions to those available in other
       desktop environments, and their names are self-descriptive.  They are
       usually not launched by hand but automatically, when choosing a LXQt
       session in the Display Manager.

BEHAVIOR
       The module detected on shares privilege access, and maintains a
       security dialog that asks for the user's key needed for access over
       another machine host.

       This module is very early stage, and not enabled by default, so you
       must added an env by the lxqt-settings application as SSH_ASKPASS= with
       lxqt-openssh-askpass value, openssl and openssh-client packages must be
       required.

AUTOSTART
       The module is only showed on LXQt desktop, but you can create an
       autostart action for your preferred desktop environment.
