NAME
       tsplot - Plot several tsung logs on the same charts, for comparison
       purpose.

SYNOPSIS
       tsplot [ -c configuration file ]  [ -d images output directory ]  [ -v
       verbose ]  [ legend logfile ]

DESCRIPTION
       Tsung comes with a plotting tool using gnuplot, producing some graphs
       from the tsung.log file data.  tsplot is able to plot data from several
       tsung.log files onto the same charts series, for further comparison and
       analyze.

OPTIONS
       -c

       --config
              specifies the configuration file to use. Default is
              http.en.plots.conf.

       -d

       --outdir
              directory where tsplot saves the images it produces, defaults to
              /tmp/tsung.

       -v

       --verbose
              makes tsplot very verbose about what it does.

CONFIGURATION
       The configuration file of tsplot allows one to define the plots you
       want to obtain, from their label to the data they will show. The
       configuration file adopts a .ini file syntax, each section defining a
       chart.

       tsplot comes with two sample configuration files, namely
       http.plots.en.conf and pgsql.plots.en.conf. They respectively define
       charts to be plotted for a tsung HTTP test and a tsung PGSQL test.

       A DEFAULT section may be provided, any element configured here may then
       be overridden into a specific plot section.

       Another configuration file is used by tsplot: the tsung/stats.conf one.
       It's used to define by type the statistics to be read into tsung log
       files, and you shouldn't need to edit it, short of adding support for
       new tsung statistics.

       Common settings, to be found into DEFAULT section or any specific chart
       section.

       encoding
              set here the encoding used thereafter in the file, for labels
              and titles.

       dpi    dpi setting of produced charts images

       tn_dpi dpi setting of produced charts thumbnail images

       imgtype
              type of chart image to produce, as in png or ps

              A complete list might be obtained on the python-matplotlib
              website, http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/

       xlabel default label for horizontal axe, often you want seconds or
              minutes, depending on xfactor.

              Please note you can also set some defaults for ylabel, but this
              seems not to be a good idea in practise.

       xfactor
              tsung logs statistics in its logfile every 10 seconds. By
              default, charts will not scale this and have seconds as
              horizontal axis units. By setting an xfactor of 60, you have a
              minute precision on horizontal axis.

       yfactor
              same as xfactor, but for vertical axis.

              Depending on the data you obtain with your tests, you may want
              to adapt the vertical scale of your plotting. For example, the
              page.mean statistic is logged in milliseconds by tsung. You may
              want to display seconds if this unit better fits your measures.
              Then simply set yfactor = 1000.

       styles set here any number of matplotlib styles you want to use,
              separated by spaces, as available here:
              http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/matplotlib.pylab.html#-plot.

              For example, set styles = b- g+ r- cx for plotting first dataset
              (see stats below) with a blue solid line, second with green plus
              symbols, third with a red line and last with cyan cross symbols.

              This could fit a stats = 200.count 400.count stats setting when
              plotting two tsung logs.

       You then can define any number of plot, one by section, and give them
       an arbitrary name. The name must be unique, and will be used for naming
       output images.

       Any option available in DEFAULT section is also available in any
       specific chart section, with the same meaning and effect. The specific
       setting will systematically override the DEFAULT one.

       title  Title of the chart, as printed into the resulting image.

       stats  The statistics properties to use for this plotting, as named in
              the tsung/stats configuration file. Please see this bundled file
              for a list of what is available.

              Tsung provide several types of statistics, as documented here:
              http://tsung.erlang-projects.org/user_manual.html#htoc53. The
              two main types of statistics used are sample and counter. A
              third one is gauge but is only use for a single statistic
              (users).

              sample provides count, mean, stdvar, max, min and gmean (global
              mean) properties, and counter provides only count and
              totalcount. gauge provide count and max.

              The stats setting can accept several stat.property elements,
              separated by spaces.

              Examples: stats = users.count to plot the number of
              simultaneously connected users, and stats = 200.count 400.count
              to plot given HTTP return codes count, both on the same chart.

              Please notice tsplot is currently limited to use only one
              horizontal and only one vertical scales. matplotlib is able to
              define some more complex drawings, but tsplot is not yet able to
              benefit from this.

       legend Legend prefix, which will be followed by the legend given on
              command line.

              Each plot on a chart has a legend entry, you configure here the
              meaning of the plot (say 'concurrent users') and tsplot will add
              it the name of the data series being plotted (say 'scenario x').
              You'd obtain this legend: 'concurrent users scenario x'.

       ylabel label for vertical axe
