PUBLICKEY(5)              FreeBSD File Formats Manual             PUBLICKEY(5)

NAME
     publickey – public key database

SYNOPSIS
     /etc/publickey

DESCRIPTION
     /etc/publickey is the public key database used for secure RPC (Remote
     Procedure Calls).  Each entry in the database consists of a network user
     name (which may either refer to a user or a hostname), followed by the
     user's public key (in hex notation), a colon, and then the user's secret
     key encrypted with its login password (also in hex notation).

     This file is altered either by the user through the chkey(1) command or
     by the system administrator through the newkey(8) command.  The file
     /etc/publickey should only contain data on the NIS master machine, where
     it is converted into the NIS database publickey.byname.
