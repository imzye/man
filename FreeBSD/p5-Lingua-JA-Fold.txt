NAME
       Lingua::JA::Fold - to fold a Japanese text.

SYNOPSIS
        use utf8;
        use Lingua::JA::Fold qw(fold tab2space kana_half2full);

        my $text = 'ï½±ï½²ï½³ï½´ï½µ    æ¼¢å—';

        # replace a [TAB] with four [SPACE]s.
        $text = tab2space('text' => $text, 'space' => 4);
        # convert a half-width 'Kana' character to a full-width one.
        $text = kana_half2full($text);

        # fold a text under full-width two characters par a line.
        $text = fold('text' => $text, 'length' => 2);

        # output the result
        utf8::encode($text);
        print $text;

DESCRIPTION
       This module is used to fold a Japanese text and so on.

       The Japanese (the Chinese and the Korean would be the same) text has
       traditionally unique manner in representing. Basically those characters
       are used to be represented in two kind of size which is 'full-width' or
       'half-width'. Width and Height of full-width characters are the same
       size (regular square). At the point, it is different from the alphabet
       characters which have normally variable (slim) width in representing.
       Roughly say, we call width of alphabet characters and Arabic numbers as
       a half, and do the width of other characters as a full. In a Japanese
       text which is mixed with alphabet and Arabic numbers, a character has a
       width, it would be full or half.

       For such reasons, to fold a Japanese text is rather complicate thing.

FUNCTIONS
       fold('text' => $text, 'length' => $i [, 'mode' => $mode])
           Function. To fold a string within specified length of $i.

           The way in which to calculate length is differs by a mode.

            'full-width' : culculated for a full-width character.
            'traditional': culculated for a full-width character; reflects traditional manner of composition.
            (not given)  : igore size difference between a full and a half.

       The Japanese Traditional Manner of Composition
           This formal manner is another saying as the forbidden rule. The
           rule is: 1) a termination mark like Ten "," and Maru ".", 2) a
           closing mark -- brace or parenthesis or bracket -- like ")", "}",
           "]", ">" and etc., 3) a repeat mark, those should not be placed at
           the top of a line. If it would be occured, such mark should be
           moved to the next to the bottom of the previous line.

           Actually by this module what is detect as a forbidden mark are
           listed next:

            â€™â€�ã€�ã€‚ã€ƒã€…ã€‰ã€‹ã€�ã€�ã€‘ã€•ã€Ÿã‚�ã‚žãƒ½ãƒ¾ï¼‰ï¼Œï¼Žï¼½ï½�

           Note that all of these marks are full-width Japanese characters.

       length_half($text)
           Function. Exportable. This is for counting length of a text for a
           half-width character.

       length_full($text)
           Function. Exportable. This is for counting length of a text for a
           full-width character.

       tab2space('text' => $text, 'space' => $i)
           Function. Exportable. To replace a [TAB] character in a text with
           given number of [SPACE]s.

       kana_half2full($text)
           Function. Exportable. To convert a character in a text from half-
           width 'Kana' to full-width one.

SEE ALSO

       module: Encode

NOTE
       This module runs under Unicode/UTF-8 environment (hence Perl5.8 or
       later is required), you should input text as UTF-8 flaged string.
       Specify the "use utf8;" pragma in your source code and use
       utf8::decode() method to UTF-8 flag on.
