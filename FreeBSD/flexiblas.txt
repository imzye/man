NAME
       flexiblas - the FlexiBLAS administration tool

SYNOPSIS
       flexiblas [options] command [command-options]

       flexiblas64 [options] command [command-options]

DESCRIPTION
       The flexiblas tool is a command line utility shipped with the FlexiBLAS
       library. It is used to configure the global and the local flexiblasrc
       file. Its main purpose it selecting the default BLAS backend used with
       FlexiBLAS and other runtime specific options. FlexiBLAS uses up to four
       locations to search for its configuration, a system-wide configuration
       file, a per-user configuration file, a per-host configuration file, and
       one configuration file defined by an environment variable
       FLEXIBLAS_CONFIG. The configuration files are evaluated in this order
       and a later loaded one overwrites the settings of a previously loaded
       one.

       The flexiblas64 tool is used for the 64-bit integer variant of
       FlexiBLAS.

       Furthermore, it can be used to add or remove BLAS backends form the
       configuration files.


   Usage Examples
       If application are build against FlexiBLAS, there are severval ways to
       select the active BLAS library. The installed (and known) BLAS backends
       can be listed via

           flexiblas list

       The default BLAS backend can be set using

          flexiblas default NAME_OF_THE_LIBRARY

       If the BLAS backend should only be set temporary, this can be done via
       the FLEXIBLAS environment variable. This can either be set to a name of
       a BLAS backend (from flexiblas list)

           FLEXIBLAS=NAME_OF_THE_LIBRARY  ./yourapp

       or to the path of a shared object containing a BLAS implementation

           FLEXIBLAS="/usr/lib/libyourblas.so" ./yourapp


   Hooks
       FlexiBLAS supports so called hooks to modify/extent/change the behavior
       of BLAS and LAPACK functions. This can be used for profiling, automatic
       offloadlind, and other debuging purposes. The hooks are configured
       either via the FLEXIBLAS_HOOK environment variable or the flexiblas
       tool. The FLEXIBLAS_HOOK variable contains a colon separate list of
       hooks or shared libraries containing the hook. The hooks are loaded in
       the order they are specified. If the hook_enabled setting in a
       configuration file is set but empty all hooks are disabled for this
       configuration file.  In this way the per host setting can disable the
       user settings. Using the hook disableall command the hook_enabled entry
       is removed and thus no hook settings are in the configuration.


   Configuration Priority
       FlexiBLAS uses serveral configuration paths to select the BLAS backend
       or enable and disable other functionality. The configuration is read in
       the following order, thereby previous read information is overwritten.
       That means that last read configuration has the highest priority.

       1. /etc/flexiblasrc - The system wide configuration file, hooks can not
       be configured here.

       2. /etc/flexiblasrc.d/*.conf - Additional system wide configurations,
       read only.

       3. ${HOME}/flexiblasrc - The user's configuration file.

       4. ${HOME}/flexiblasrc.$(hostname) - The user's configuration file on a
       host, useful for NFS homedirectories.

       5. FLEXIBLAS_CONFIG - The environment variable is used to specified a
       separate configuration file, e.g. per project.

       6. FLEXIBLAS, FLEXIBLAS_HOOK - Select a BLAS implementation or a hook
       without changing the config.


   64-bit Integers
       If FlexiBLAS is compiled with 64 bit intergers, flexiblas is replaced
       by flexiblas64 and FLEXIBLAS is replaced by FLEXIBLAS64 in all names of
       configuration files, environment variable, etc.


OPTIONS
   Commands
       help   Print information about the tool and its usage.

       print  Print the whole BLAS related configuration including search
              paths, default settings, etc.

       list   List all available BLAS libraries from the configuration files.

       default BLASNAME
              Sets the default BLAS backend in the selected configuration
              file.

       default
              Removes the default setting from the selected configuration
              file.

       add BLASNAME sharedlibrary.so ["comment string"]
              Add a new BLAS backend called "BLASNAME" to the selected
              configuration file. This will create a section like

                [BLASNAME]
                library=sharedlibrary.so
                comment="comment string"

              in the selected configuration file. The comment string is
              optional.

       remove NAME
              Remove a BLAS backed called "NAME" from the selected
              configuration file.

       set property [value]
              Set a property in the configuration file. If the value is not
              given the property is reset to its default. The available
              properties are listed below.


   Hook commands:
       Hooks are additional plugins that integrate in the call of a BLAS or
       LAPACK function. They are used for debugging or profiling purpose.


       hook list
              List all available hooks. The hooks are automatically found in
              the FlexiBLAS library directories.

       hook show hook-name
              Show details about a specific hook. This includes the name, the
              authors, a short description, and the list of configurable
              options.

       hook enable hook-name
              Enable a hook. If more than one hook is enabled they are
              executed in the order they got enabled.

       hook disable hook-name
              Disable a hook.

       hook disableall
              Disable all hooks in a configuration and remove the setting from
              the configuration. This is necessary if, i.e., hooks are enabled
              in the user configuration and the host configuration file has an
              empty hook_enabled field. In this case the FlexiBLAS does not
              use a hook since the host configuration overwrites the user
              configuration. Then hook disableall is used to remove the
              hook_enabled from the host configuration.

       hook enabled
              Show all enabled hooks in the configuration files.

       hook active
              Show the currently active hooks and from which configuration
              file they are loaded.

       hook set hook-name option-name value
              Set an option for a hook to the given value. All available
              options for a hook can be shown with the hook show command.
              0ook-name option-name Unset an option for a hook.


   General Options:
       -u, --user
              Edit the user's flexiblasrc configuration (default options,
              except of executing as root).

       -g, --global
              Edit the global flexiblasrc configuration (default in case of
              executing as root).

       -H, --host
              Edit the host configuration file.

       -E, --environment
              Edit the configuration file given by the environment variable
              FLEXIBLAS_CONFIG.

       -p, --pipe
              Make the output of some commands, like list pipe compatible to
              use them in scripts.

       -h, --help
              Print this information and exit.

       -v, --version
              Print the versionformation and exit.


   Properties
       verbose integer
              Change the verbosity level of FlexiBLAS. The default verbosity
              level is 0 which only displays critical errors. If a level
              larger than  is specified, FlexiBLAS will produce many debug
              information on stderr.

       nolapack integer
              If the value is non zero, FlexiBLAS does not load the LAPACK
              functions from the backend. That means that only the internal
              LAPACK routines are used.

FILES
       /etc/flexiblasrc
              System-wide FlexiBLAS configuration file.

       /etc/flexiblasrc.d/*.conf
              Additional system-wide configuration files. Read-only, Installed
              by BLAS library to be included in FlexiBLAS.

       ~/.flexiblasrc
              User FlexiBLAS configuration file.

       ~/.flexiblasrc.$(hostname)
              User FlexiBLAS configuration file for a specific host.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       FLEXIBLAS_CONFIG
              Using the FLEXIBLAS_CONFIG environment variable an additional
              configuration can be set. This can be used for per-project
              settings.

       FLEXIBLAS
              Select a BLAS implementation ignoring the configuration
              settings. If the content of the variable is a path to a shared
              object containing a BLAS library, this is used as BLAS
              implementation. It is not required that this BLAS library is
              configured in any of the configuration files.

       FLEXIBLAS_HOOK
              The FLEXIBLAS_HOOK variable contains a colon separated list of
              hooks which should be loaded. If a hook is a path to a shared
              object instead of a name of an available hook, FlexiBLAS tries
              to  load this library as a hook,

       FLEXIBLAS_LIBRARY_PATH
              The FLEXIBLAS_LIBRARY_PATH variable contains a colon separated
              list of addtional search paths for FlexiBLAS.  The paths are
              used to find BLAS implementations and hooks.
