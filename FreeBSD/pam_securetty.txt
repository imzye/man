PAM_SECURETTY(8)        FreeBSD System Manager's Manual       PAM_SECURETTY(8)

NAME
     pam_securetty – SecureTTY PAM module

SYNOPSIS
     [service-name] module-type control-flag pam_securetty [options]

DESCRIPTION
     The SecureTTY service module for PAM, pam_securetty provides
     functionality for only one PAM category: account management.  In terms of
     the module-type parameter, this is the “account” feature.  It also
     provides null functions for authentication and session management.

   SecureTTY Account Management Module
     The SecureTTY account management component (pam_sm_acct_mgmt()), returns
     failure if the user is attempting to authenticate as superuser, and the
     process is attached to an insecure TTY.  In all other cases, the module
     returns success.

     A TTY is considered secure if it is listed in /etc/ttys and has the
     TTY_SECURE flag set.

     The following options may be passed to the authentication module:

     debug        syslog(3) debugging information at LOG_DEBUG level.

     no_warn      suppress warning messages to the user.  These messages
                  include reasons why the user's authentication attempt was
                  declined.
