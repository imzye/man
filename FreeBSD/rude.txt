CRUDE(8)                FreeBSD System Manager's Manual               CRUDE(8)

NAME
       crude - collector for rude (real-time UDP data emitter)

SYNOPSIS
       crude [ -h ] [ -v ] [ -d file ] [ -P 0-90 ] [ -p port ] [ -i ip_addr ]
       [ -l file ] [ -s flow_id_list ] [ -n number ]


DESCRIPTION
       Crude is the receiver and logging utility for flows that are generated
       with the rude(8) tool. In the default operation mode crude prints the
       information to standard output, so you'll have to redirect it to file
       if you like to process it later on. Our recommendation is to log the
       data into file with the '-l' option. This reduces I/O operations
       because the data is logged in binary format and soforth improves
       performance. You can decode the file later on with the option '-d'. If
       you want simple statistics of specific flows use the '-s' option. Note
       that options '-d' and '-s' are mutually exclusive.


OPTIONS
       -h     Print a short help.

       -v     Print the version information.

       -d     Decode the capture to stdout from file, which was generated by
              the '-l' option.

       -P     Set the process in real-time round-robin scheduling with the
              given priority.  Needs root permission. Use with care.

       -p     Set the UDP port to listen to. The default is 10001.

       -i     Set the physical interface to listen from. The argument is the
              IP address for the specific interface in numerical dotted
              notation (a.b.c.d). If this is not set, the program will listen
              to all interfaces.

       -l     Log the capture into file in binary format. The default action
              is to print out the decoded info into stdout.

       -s     Print statistics of the given flowlist to stdout. The flowlist
              is a comma separated list of flow-identifiers. The statistics
              for each flow include:
                      o number of received packets
                      o num. of packets received out of sequence
                      o estimated number of lost packets
                      o total bytes received
                      o average delay
                      o absolute maximum jitter
                      o throughtput

       -n     Set the number of packets to capture. The default value is 0,
              which means until interrupted with CTRL+C.
