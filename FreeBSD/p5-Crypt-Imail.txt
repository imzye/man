NAME
       Crypt::Imail - encrypt and decrypt IMail passwords

SYNOPSIS
         use Crypt::Imail;

         $im = Crypt::Imail->new();

         my $encrypted_pass = $im->encrypt($user, $password);

         my $password = $im->decrypt($user, $encrypted_pass);

ABSTRACT
       Used to Encrypt and Decrypt passwords generated by imail.

DESCRIPTION
       This package is used to encrypt and decrypt passwords generated by
       IMail.

       See: http://www.ipswitch.com/products/imail_server/

       This came about because I kept reading newsgroup posts about how
       horrible IMails encryption scheme was.  Then one day I get a call that
       a friend needs to move all the email accounts from and NT box running
       imail to linux and wants to have as little disruption as possible to
       everyone's services.  So I wrote this object for him.  I hope two
       things come out of it.  First, I hope this proves helpful to others.
       Secondly, I hope it doesn't because Imail got their act together and
       fixed their "encryption" scheme.

   EXPORT
       None by default.
