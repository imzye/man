NAME
     pmap_resident_count, pmap_wired_count – return page resident and wiring
     statistics

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <vm/vm.h>
     #include <vm/pmap.h>

     long
     pmap_resident_count(pmap_t pmap);

     long
     pmap_wired_count(pmap_t pmap);

DESCRIPTION
     The pmap_resident_count() and pmap_wired_count() macros allow pmap
     consumers to retrieve statistics from the pm_stats member of the machine-
     dependent structure struct pmap.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
     Both functions are defined as in-line macros.  The members which they
     access have type long.

RETURN VALUES
     The pmap_resident_count() returns the number of pages in the physical map
     pmap which are currently resident in main memory.

     The pmap_wired_count() returns the number of pages in the physical map
     pmap which are currently wired into in main memory.
