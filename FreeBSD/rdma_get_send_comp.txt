RDMA_GET_SEND_COMP(3)    Librdmacm Programmer's Manual   RDMA_GET_SEND_COMP(3)



NAME
       rdma_get_send_comp - retrieves a completed send, read, or write
       request.

SYNOPSIS
       #include <rdma/rdma_verbs.h>

       int rdma_get_send_comp (struct rdma_cm_id *id, struct ibv_wc *wc);

ARGUMENTS
       id          A reference to a communication identifier to check for
                   completions.

       wc          A reference to a work completion structure to fill in.

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a completed work request for a send, RDMA read, or RDMA write
       operation.  Information about the completed request is returned through
       the wc parameter, with the wr_id set to the context of the request.
       For details on the work completion structure, see ibv_poll_cq.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns the number of returned completions (0 or 1) on success, or -1
       on error.  If an error occurs, errno will be set to indicate the
       failure reason.

NOTES
       This calls polls the send completion queue associated with an
       rdma_cm_id.  If a completion is not found, the call blocks until a
       request completes.  This call should only be used on rdma_cm_id's that
       do not share CQs with other rdma_cm_id's, and maintain separate CQs for
       sends and receive completions.
