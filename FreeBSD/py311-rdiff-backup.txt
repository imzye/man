RDIFF-BACKUP-DELETE(1)                        Rdiff-Backup-Delete Manual 2.2.6

NAME
       rdiff-backup-delete - deletes a file and its whole history from a
       repository

SYNOPSIS
       rdiff-backup-delete [--dry-run] [--help] repository-sub-path

DESCRIPTION
       rdiff-backup-delete removes a file or directory from a repository
       created by 'rdiff-backup', together with its complete history.

       The required argument is the pathname of the sub-directory or file
       within an rdiff-backup repository.

       For example, after a backup with 'rdiff-backup backup source repo',
       potentially called multiple times, you can remove a file and its whole
       history with 'rdiff-backup-delete repo/somefile'.

       The utility is best used to remove too big or secret files erroneously
       backed-up.  Beware that no trace of the file will remain in the
       repository after its deletion.

OPTIONS
       --dry-run
           Only show what would happen but don’t actually delete anything.

       -h, --help
           Output a short usage description and exit.

BUGS
       None known.
