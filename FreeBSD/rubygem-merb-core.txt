RAKE(1)                 FreeBSD General Commands Manual                RAKE(1)

NAME
       rake - simple build program similar to make

SYNOPSIS
       rake [options]

DESCRIPTION
       rake has the following features:

       * Rakefiles (rake's version of Makefiles) are completely defined in
         standard Ruby syntax.  No XML files to edit.  No quirky Makefile
         syntax to worry about (is that a tab or a space?)

       * Users can specify tasks with prerequisites.

       * Rake supports rule patterns to sythesize implicit tasks.

       * Rake is lightweight.  It can be distributed with other projects as a
         single file.  Projects that depend upon rake do not require that
         rake be installed on target systems.
