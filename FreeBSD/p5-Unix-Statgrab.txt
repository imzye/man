NAME
       Unix::Statgrab - Perl extension for collecting information about the
       machine

SYNOPSIS
           use Unix::Statgrab;

           my $host_stats = get_host_info();
           print $host_stats->hostname . " is a " . $host_stats->bitwidth . " " . $host_stats->os_name . "\n";

           my $filesystems = get_fs_stats();
           my @mount_points = map { $filesystems->mnt_point($_) } (0 .. $filesystems->entries() - 1);
           print $host_stats->hostname . " has " . join( ", ", @mount_points ) . " mounted\n";

           my $proc_list = get_process_stats();
           my @proc_by_type;
           foreach my $proc_entry (0 .. $proc_list->entries() - 1) {
               $proc_by_type[$proc_list->state($proc_entry)]++;
           }
           my $total_procs = 0;
           $total_procs += $_ for grep { defined $_ } @proc_by_type;
           foreach my $state (qw(SG_PROCESS_STATE_RUNNING SG_PROCESS_STATE_SLEEPING
                                 SG_PROCESS_STATE_STOPPED SG_PROCESS_STATE_ZOMBIE
                                                 SG_PROCESS_STATE_UNKNOWN)) {
               defined $proc_by_type[Unix::Statgrab->$state] or next;
               print $proc_by_type[Unix::Statgrab->$state] . " of " . $total_procs . " procs in $state\n";
           }

           my $last_cpu_stats = get_cpu_stats() or croak( get_error()->strperror() );
           do_sth_way_longer();
           my $cpu_diff = get_cpu_stats()->get_cpu_stats_diff($last_cpu_stats);

           my $last_cpu_percent = $last_cpu_percent->get_cpu_percents();

DESCRIPTION
       Unix::Statgrab is a wrapper for libstatgrab as available from
       <http://www.i-scream.org/libstatgrab/>. It is a reasonably portable
       attempt to query interesting stats about your computer. It covers
       information on the operating system, CPU, memory usage, network
       interfaces, hard-disks etc.

       Each of the provided functions follow a simple rule: It never takes any
       argument and returns either an object (in case of success) or "undef".
       In case "undef" was returned, check the return value of "get_error".
       Also see "ERROR HANDLING" further below.

       To avoid error during copying documentation, the original function
       documentation will be refererred where reasonable. Each returned object
       has a getter method named as the attribute in original documentation.
       Those getters take a optional index argument, asking for the attribute
       of the "n"th statistic item. Further, each object provides an
       "entries"() method, telling you how much statistics for requested type
       are returned (yes, even get_host_info() has that, maybe we have more
       host_info when grabbing that statistic in a cluster, grid or cloud).
       Additionally, for the users of Perl's list processing features, each
       object has an "as_list"() method which returns the statistic as list of
       hash items containing each attribute / value pair of available
       attributes.

FUNCTIONS
   drop_privileges()
       Unix::Statgrab can be told to discard setuid and setgid privileges
       which is usually a good thing. If your program doesn't need the
       elevated privileges somewhere else, call it right after "use"ing the
       module.

       This function is depreciated and might be removed in a future version
       of libstatgrab (and then in Unix::Statgrab, too).

   get_host_info()
       Returns generic information about this machine. The object it returns
       is a Unix::Statgrab::sg_host_info.

   get_cpu_stats
       Returns information about this machine's usage of the CPU. The object
       it returns is an Unix::Statgrab::sg_cpu_stats.

   get_disk_io_stats
       Delivers the disk IO per disk stored in the kernel which holds the
       amount of data transferred since boot. The object it returns is a
       Unix::Statgrab::sg_disk_io_stats.

   get_fs_stats
       Returns statistics about the mounted filesystems. The object it returns
       is a Unix::Statgrab::sg_fs_stats.

   get_load_stats
       Returns the load average over various span of times. The object it
       returns is a Unix::Statgrab::sg_load_stats.

   get_mem_stats
       Returns statistics about memory usage. The object it returns is a
       Unix::Statgrab::sg_mem_stats.

   get_swap_stats
       Returns statistics about swap usage. The object it returns is a
       Unix::Statgrab::sg_swap_stats.

   get_network_io_stats
       Returns statistics about the network traffic per network interface as
       stored in the kernel. The object it returns is a
       Unix::Statgrab::sg_network_io_stats.

   get_network_iface_stats
       Returns statistics about each of the found network interfaces in your
       computer.  The object it returns is a
       Unix::Statgrab::sg_network_iface_stats.

   get_page_stats
       Returns the number of pages the system has paged in and out since
       bootup.  The object it returns is a Unix::Statgrab::sg_page_stats.

   get_process_stats
       Returns loads of information about the current processes.  The object
       it returns is a Unix::Statgrab::sg_process_stats.

   get_user_stats
       Returns session information about logged on users.  The object it
       returns is a Unix::Statgrab::sg_user_stats.

ERROR HANDLING
       One function "get_error" exists that will return the last error
       encountered, if any. It's return value is an object of type
       Unix::Statgrab::sg_error_details.

   Where can I go for help?
       If you have a bug report, a patch or a suggestion, please open a new
       report ticket at CPAN (but please check previous reports first in case
       your issue has already been addressed). You can mail any of the module
       maintainers, but you are more assured of an answer by posting to the
       i-scream-users list or reporting the issue in RT.

       Report tickets should contain a detailed description of the bug or
       enhancement request and at least an easily verifiable way of
       reproducing the issue or fix. Patches are always welcome, too.

   Where can I go for help with a concrete version?
       Bugs and feature requests are accepted against the latest version only.
       To get patches for earlier versions, you need to get an agreement with
       a developer of your choice - who may or not report the issue and a
       suggested fix upstream (depends on the license you have chosen).
