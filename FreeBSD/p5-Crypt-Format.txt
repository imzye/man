NAME
       Crypt::Format - Conversion utilities for encryption applications

SYNOPSIS
           use Crypt::Format;

           my $der = Crypt::Format::pem2der($pem);
           my $pem = Crypt::Format::der2pem($der, 'CERTIFICATE REQUEST');

           my $good_pem = Crypt::Format::normalize_pem($weird_pem);

           # Split PEM chains such as application/pem-certificate-chain …
           my @pems = Crypt::Format::split_pem_chain($pem_chain);

           {
               #If, for whatever reason, you don’t like MIME::Base64,
               #then customize this. The module must have encode() and/or decode()
               #functions, depending on which of this module’s functions you use.
               #
               local $Crypt::Format::BASE64_MODULE = '..';

               Crypt::Format::...
           }

DESCRIPTION
       Not much more to say! This module is for simple conversions that I got
       tired of writing out.
