DateTime::Util::Calc(3)                    User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       DateTime::Util::Calc - DateTime Calculation Utilities

SYNOPSIS
         use DateTime::Util::Calc qw(polynomial);

         my @coeffs = qw(2 3 -2);
         my $x      = 5;
         my $rv     = polynomial($x, @coeffs);

DESCRIPTION
       This module contains some common calculation utilities that are
       required to perform datetime calculations, specifically from
       "Calendrical Calculations" -- they are NOT meant to be general purpose.

       Nothing is exported by default. You must either explicitly export them,
       or use as fully qualified function names.

FUNCTIONS
   max($a, $b)
   min($a, $b)
       max() returns the bigger of $a and $b. min() returns the smaller of $a
       and $b.

   polynomial($x, @coefs)
       Calculates the value of a polynomial equation, based on Horner's Rule.

          c + b * x + a * (x ** 2)     x = 5

       is expressed as:

          polynomial(5, c, b, a);

   moment($dt)
   dt_from_moment($moment)
       moment() converts a DateTime object to moment, which is RD days + the
       time of day as fraction of the total seconds in a day.

       dt_from_moment() converts a moment to DateTime object.

   rata_die()
       Returns a new DateTime object that is set to Rata Die, 0001-01-01
       00:00:00 UTC

   bigfloat($v)
   bigint($v)
       If the value $v is not a Math::BigFloat object, returns the value
       converted to Math::BigFloat. Otherwise returns the value itself.

       bigint() does the same for Math::BigInt.

   bf_downgrade($v)
   bi_downgrade($v)
       These have been deprecated.

   truncate_to_midday($dt)
       Truncates the DateTime object to 12:00 noon.

   sin_deg($degrees)
   cos_deg($degrees)
   tan_deg($degrees)
   asin_deg($degrees)
   acos_deg($degrees)
       Each of these functions calculates their respective values based on
       degrees, not radians (as Perl's version of sin() and cos() would do).

   mod($v,$mod)
       Calculates the modulus of $v over $mod. Perl's built-in modulus
       operator (%) for some reason rounds numbers UP when a fractional
       number's modulus is taken. Many of the calculations also needed the
       fractional part of the calculation, so this function takes care of
       both.

       Example:

         mod(12.234, 5) = 2.234

   amod($v,$mod)
       This function is almost identical to mod(), but when the regular
       modulus value is 0, returns $mod instead of 0.

       Example:

         amod(11, 5) = 1
         amod(10, 5) = 5
         amod(9, 5)  = 4
         amod(8, 5)  = 3

   binary_search($hi, $lo, $mu, $phi)
       This is a special version of binary search, where the terminating
       condition is determined by the result of coderefs $mu and $phi.

       $mu is passed the value of $hi and $lo. If it returns true upon
       execution, then the search terminates.

       $phi is passed the next median value. If it returns true upon
       execution, then the search terminates.

       If the above two fails, then $hi and $lo are re-computed for the next
       iteration.

   search_next(%opts)
       Performs a "linear" search until some condition is met. This is a
       generalized version of the formula defined in [1] p.22. The basic idea
       is :

         x = base
         while (! check(x) ) {
            x = next(x);
         }
         return x

       %opts can contain the following parameters:

       base
           The initial value to use to start the search process. The value can
           be anything, but you must provide "check" and "next" parameters
           that are capable of handling the type of thing you specified.

       check (coderef)
           Code to be executed to determine the end of the search. The
           function receives the current value of "x", and should return a
           true value if the condition to end the loop has been reached

       next (coderef, optional)
           Code to be executed to determine the next value of "x". The
           function receives the current value of "x", and should return the
           value to be used for the next iteration.

           If unspecified, it will use a function that blindly adds 1 to
           whatever x is.  (so if you specified a number for "base", it should
           work -- but if you passed an object like DateTime, it will probably
           be an error)

       So for example, to iterate through 1 through 9, you could do something
       like this

         my $x = search_next(
           base => 1,
           check => sub { $_[0] == 9 }
         );

       And $x will be set to 9. For a more interesting example, we could look
       for a DateTime object $dt matching a certain condition foo():

         my $dt = search_next(
           base  => $base_date,
           check => \&foo,
           next  => sub { $_[0] + DateTime::Duration->new(days => 1) }
         );

   deg2rad
       Converts degrees to radians using Math::Trig, but works for
       Math::BigInt objects as well.

   revolution($angle_in_degrees)
       Reduces any angle to within the first revolution by sbtracting or
       adding even multiples of 360.0.

   rev180($angle_in_degrees)
       Reduces input to within +180..+180 degrees

   angle($h, $m, $s)
