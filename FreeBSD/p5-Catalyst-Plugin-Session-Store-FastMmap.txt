NAME
       Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store::FastMmap - FastMmap session storage
       backend.

SYNOPSIS
           use Catalyst qw/Session Session::Store::FastMmap Session::State::Foo/;

           MyApp->config(
               'Plugin::Session' => {
                   expires => 3600,
                   storage => '/tmp/session'
               },
           );

           # ... in an action:
           $c->session->{foo} = 'bar'; # will be saved

DESCRIPTION
       "Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store::FastMmap" is a fast session storage
       plugin for Catalyst that uses an mmap'ed file to act as a shared memory
       interprocess cache. It is based on Cache::FastMmap.

   METHODS
       get_session_data
       store_session_data
       delete_session_data
       delete_expired_sessions
           These are implementations of the required methods for a store. See
           Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store.

       get_and_set_session_data
           This is the optional method for atomic write semantics. See
           Catalyst::Plugin::Session::AtomicWrite.

       setup_session
           Sets up the session cache file.

CAVEATS
       Very loaded sites with lots of data in the session hash may have old
       sessions expired prematurely, due to the LRU caching policy employed by
       Cache::FastMmap. To get around this you can increase the "cache_size"
       parameter, or switch session storage backends.  Cache::FastMmap
       defaults to around 5mb (89 * 64k).

       This is particularly inappropriate for use as a backend for e.g.
       Catalyst::Plugin::Session::PerUser, for example.

       As Cache::FastMmap is not "thread-safe" (at least version 1.30 and
       before) therefore also this module does not work in multi-threaded
       environment.  It is "fork-safe", however keep in mind that on Win32 the
       perl "fork" call is implemented as an emulation via threads - that is
       the reason why you cannot use this store for example when running you
       catalyst application on Win32 platform with
       Catalyst::Engine::HTTP::Prefork engine.

CONFIGURATION
       These parameters are placed in the hash under the "Plugin::Session" key
       in the configuration hash.

       storage
           Specifies the file to be used for the sharing of session data. The
           default value will use File::Spec to find the default tempdir, and
           use a file named "MyApp_session_data", where "MyApp" is replaced
           with the appname.

           Note that the file will be created with mode 0640, which means that
           it will only be writeable by processes running with the same uid as
           the process that creates the file.  If this may be a problem, for
           example if you may try to debug the program as one user and run it
           as another, specify a filename like "/tmp/session-$>", which
           includes the UID of the process in the filename.

       init_file
       cache_size
       unlink_on_exit
           See the Cache::FastMmap documentation for the meaning of these
           keys. If these keys are not present Cache::FastMmap's defaults will
           be used.
