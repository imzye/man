NAME
       wmnet - Network Statistics Monitor for WindowMaker

SYNOPSIS
       wmnet [ -v ] [ -i <name> ] [ -u <delay> ] [ -h ]

DESCRIPTION
       wmnet is a WindowMaker Dock.app that graphically displays network
       traffic. The data throughput is sampled once a second and displayed on
       a scrolling graph.

       The application window is divided into three sections.

       Graph  Most of the window consists of the graph. This graph shows the
              profile of the network traffic. Every second the contents are
              scrolled to the left as a new data point is added to the right
              hand side. The graph itself is divided into two sections. The
              upper half displays the incoming traffic, the lower half handles
              the outgoing traffic. Both portions are displayed at the same
              scale. The scale is set to the maximum data rate that's
              displayed in the window. This scale is also displayed as a
              number and is shown in the lower left corner of the graph.

       Label  The upper left section displays the currently selected
              interface. To switch to a different interface, click anywhere in
              the label.

       Status The upper right section contains three LEDs. The leftmost LED,
              when "lit", indicates the current interface is up.  The middle
              LED indicates the current interface is running.  The rightmost
              LED is red and indicates the current interface is in promiscuous
              mode.

       One final note: Even though this is intended to be a WindowMaker
       application, it still should work under other window managers.

OPTIONS
       wmnet supports several command line options:

       -v     Displays the current version and then exits.

       -i <name>
              Specifies the network interface that should be displayed.

       -u <delay>
              Specifies the delay between samples. The delay is given in
              seconds and defaults to 1 second between samples.

       -h     Print out help text.

HISTORY
       This program started as a port of WMiFS. The original version was
       written for Linux and had Linux-specific code scattered throughout the
       source.

       Although this version is BSD-specific, all the statistic gathering
       routines are in a separate module. All information is obtained through
       the module's interface. It's now easier to port WMNet to Linux than it
       is to port WMiFS to BSD!
