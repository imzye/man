SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
       TinyCols is a simple puzzle game for the terminal where the player must
       position clusters of colorful jewels into a grid in order to match them
       and remove them.

       The player controls one cluster of three jewels at a time and can
       rotate their order. In order to remove jewels, there must be at least
       three lined up in any direction (vertical, horizontal, and diagonal).
       The game is over when the jewels overflow the top of the grid.

       <LEFT>: Move piece left

       <DOWN>: Move piece down

       <UP> or <A>: Rotate jewels upwards
