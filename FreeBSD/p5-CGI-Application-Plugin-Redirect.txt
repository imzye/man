       CGI::Application::Plugin::Redirect - Easy external redirects in
       CGI::Application

SYNOPSIS
        package My::App;

        use CGI::Application::Plugin::Redirect;

        sub cgiapp_prerun {
            my $self = shift;

        }

DESCRIPTION
       This plugin provides an easy way to do external redirects in
       CGI::Application.  You don't have to worry about setting headers or
       worrying about return types, as that is all handled for you.

       "redirect" does an external redirect, which means that the browser will
       receive a command to load a new page, and a fresh request will come in.
       If you just want to display the results of another runmode within the
       same module, then it is often sufficient to use the "forward" method in
       CGI::Application::Plugin::Forward instead.

METHODS
   redirect($url, $status)
       Interupt the current request, and redirect to an external URL.  If you
       happen to be inside a prerun method when you call this, the current
       runmode will automatically be short circuited so that it will not
       execute.  As soon as all prerun method have finished, the redirect will
       happen without the runmode being executed.

       The $status paramater is optional as the CGI module will default to
       something suitable.

         return $self->redirect('http://www.example.com/');

         - or -

         return $self->redirect('http://www.example.com/', '301 Moved Permanently');
