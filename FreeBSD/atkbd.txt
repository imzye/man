ATKBD(4)               FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual               ATKBD(4)

NAME
     atkbd – the AT keyboard interface

SYNOPSIS
     options ATKBD_DFLT_KEYMAP
     makeoptions ATKBD_DFLT_KEYMAP=_keymap_name_
     options KBD_DISABLE_KEYMAP_LOAD
     device atkbd

     In /boot/device.hints:
     hint.atkbd.0.at="atkbdc"
     hint.atkbd.0.irq="1"

DESCRIPTION
     The atkbd driver, together with the atkbdc driver, provides access to the
     AT 84 keyboard or the AT enhanced keyboard which is connected to the AT
     keyboard controller.

     This driver is required for the console driver syscons(4) or vt(4).

     There can be only one atkbd device defined in the kernel configuration
     file.  This device also requires the atkbdc keyboard controller to be
     present.  The irq number must always be 1; there is no provision of
     changing the number.

   Function Keys
     The AT keyboard has a number of function keys.  They are numbered as
     follows and can be associated with strings by the kbdcontrol(1) command.
     You can use a keyboard map file (see kbdmap(5)) to map them to arbitrary
     keys, particularly the functions in the range from 65 to 96 which are not
     used by default.

     See the man page for the kbdcontrol(1) command for how to assign a string
     to the function key.

DRIVER CONFIGURATION
   Kernel Configuration Options
     The following kernel configuration options control the atkbd driver.

     ATKBD_DFLT_KEYMAP
                 This option sets the default, built-in keymap of the atkbd
                 driver to the named keymap.  See EXAMPLES below.

     KBD_DISABLE_KEYMAP_LOAD
                 The keymap can be modified by the kbdcontrol(1) command.
                 This option will disable this feature and prevent the user
                 from changing key assignment.

   Driver Flags
     The atkbd driver accepts the following driver flags.  They can be set
     either in /boot/device.hints, or else from within the boot loader (see
     loader(8)).

     bit 0 (FAIL_IF_NO_KBD)
           By default the atkbd driver will install even if a keyboard is not
           actually connected to the system.  This option prevents the driver
           from being installed in this situation.

     bit 1 (NO_RESET)
           When this option is given, the atkbd driver will not reset the
           keyboard when initializing it.  It may be useful for laptop
           computers whose function keys have special functions and these
           functions are forgotten when the keyboard is reset.

     bit 2 (ALT_SCANCODESET)
           Certain keyboards, such as those on some ThinkPad models, behave
           like the old XT keyboard and require this option.

     bit 3 (NO_PROBE_TEST)
           When this option is given, the atkbd driver will not test the
           keyboard port during the probe routine.  Some machines hang during
           boot when this test is performed.

EXAMPLES
     The atkbd driver requires the keyboard controller atkbdc.  Thus, the
     kernel configuration file should contain the following lines.

           device atkbdc
           device atkbd

     The following example shows how to set the default, built-in keymap to
     jp.106.kbd.

           device atkbdc
           options ATKBD_DFLT_KEYMAP
           makeoptions ATKBD_DFLT_KEYMAP=jp.106
           device atkbd

     In both cases, you also need to have following lines in
     /boot/device.hints.

           hint.atkbdc.0.at="isa"
           hint.atkbdc.0.port="0x060"
           hint.atkbd.0.at="atkbdc"
           hint.atkbd.0.irq="1"
