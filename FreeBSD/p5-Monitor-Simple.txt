DESCRIPTION
       smonitor is a command-line tool for monitoring (checking) various
       services and other parts of your IT infrastructure. In order to run it,
       you need to have a configuration file that defines what services to
       check and how to do the checking. Details how to create such
       configuration file are in the documentation of the Perl module
       Monitor::Simple; just type:

          perldoc Monitor::Simple

OPTIONS
       The command-line arguments and options can be specified with single or
       double dash. Most of them can be abbreviated to the nearest unbiased
       length. They are case-sensitive.

   -cfg <config-file>
       It specifies what configuration file to use (read: what services to
       check). By default, it uses file monitor-simple-cfg.xml.

   -service <service-name> [<service-name>...]
       By default, smonitor checks all services specified in the configuration
       file. This parameter can select only some services. For example:

          smonitor -cfg my.cfg -service synonia mrs

   -outfile <file>
       It specifies a file where the report about checking is written to. By
       default, it is written to standard output (but see also possible
       combinations with "-onlyerr" option).

       A note about notifications: This parameter "-outfile" has nothing to do
       with notifications. The notifications are messages about the status of
       individual services and they are defined (if at all) in the
       configuration file (where it is also specified where to send them and
       how to format them). You cannot influence notifications by any
       parameter of the smonitor. Well, it is not entirely true: You can use
       parameter "-nonotif" to disable all notifications.

   -onlyerr
       This option influences what will be reported on the standard output
       (STDOUT). The overall behaviour depends on the combination of
       "-outfile" and "-onlyerr" parameters:

          -outfile <file>    -onlyerr    what will be done
          -----------------------------------------------------
          yes                no         all output to <file>

          yes                yes        all output to <file>
                                        + errors also on STDOUT

          no                 no         all output to STDOUT

          no                 yes        only errors to STDOUT

       The variety of output destinations allows to run smonitor as a "cron"
       job (a scheduled job) and to decide when the scheduling system reports
       the results. Just remember that these reports, sent by the scheduling
       system, are not the same as notifications defined in the configuration
       file - these two ways how to report status of services are independent
       and both can be used in the same time.

   -format human | tsv | html
       How the report will be formatted. Default is "human":

          DATE                           SERVICE                 STATUS  MESSAGE
          Tue Sep 27 10:40:15 2011       Memory Check                 2  Memory CRITICAL - 91.7% (1601124 kB) used
          Tue Sep 27 10:40:15 2011       Current timestamp            0  Tue Sep 27 10:40:15 2011
          Tue Sep 27 10:40:15 2011       Born To Be Killed            2  Plugin 'Monitor/Simple/plugins/born-to-be-killed.pl' died with signal 9

          Tue Sep 27 10:40:15 2011       Synonia Bad Params           2  500 Can't connect to Xdb.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa:80...

       The "tsv" is a TAB-separated output, without any header line. The
       "html" format creates a simple HTML page with the report.

   -cssurl <url>
       This is used only when "-format html" is used. It specifies a URL of a
       CSS-stylesheet that can change the look-and-feel of the HTML report
       page. See the source of the page for the CSS-classes names.

   -npp <integer>
       A not much used parameter, rather a technical one: it specifies maximum
       number of parallel checks. Because each check is done by a new process,
       the "npp" parameter actually stands for "Number of Parallel Processes".
       Default is 10.

   -nonotif
       This options disables executing all notifications (as they are defined
       in the configuration file). It is, for example, useful when you are
       testing a new configuration file and you do not wish to send emails,
       etc.  about it

   Logging options
       Additional to the report about the status of services (parameters
       "-outfile" and "-onlyerr") and to the notifications (defined in the
       configuration file) there is also a logging mechanism that helps to
       trace how the checking is done in more details. The logging is defined
       by few logging parameters - they all have reasonable default values.

       -logfile <logfile>
           Where to put log records. By default, it appends records to the
           file smonitor.log (which is created if it does not exist yet). You
           can also specify "STDOUT" as the logfile:

              -logfile STDOUT

       -loglevel debug | info | warn | error | fatal
           Each log record has its level of importance (five possible levels:
           from "debug" to "fatal"). This parameter tells which log records
           (read: records of what importance) will be created. A level means
           also all levels "below" it. For example, level "warn" includes
           "warn", "error" and "fatal" messages. Default level is "info".

       -debug
           It is the same as "-loglevel debug".

       -logformat <string>
           It specifies how to format log records. Default format is
           "%d (%r) %p %m%n>" when the log records look like this:

              2011/09/27 12:18:50 (97)  INFO> --- Checking started ---
              2011/09/27 12:18:50 (100) DEBUG> Started: Monitor/Simple/plugins/check_mem.pl -u -w 55 -c 80
              2011/09/27 12:18:50 (100) DEBUG> Started: Monitor/Simple/plugins/check-url.pl -cfg configs/simple-example-cfg.xml -service pubmed -logfile a.log -loglevel debug
              2011/09/27 12:18:50 (30)  DEBUG> Invoking HTTP HEAD: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/
              2011/09/27 12:18:51 (760) INFO> Done: pubmed 0 OK
              2011/09/27 12:18:51 (971) INFO> --- Checking finished [0.872014999389648 s] ---

           The columns in this examples are: date (%d), number of milliseconds
           from the moment smonitor was started (%r), log level (%p) and log
           message (%m). More details about formats are in the Perl module
           Log::Log4perl.

   -showcfg
       It prints the name of the used configuration file and its content and
       it exits. It is rather for debugging.

   -lf
       It prints the currently available formats (the values recognizable by
       the "-format" parameter) and exits:

          $> smonitor -lf
          html    Formatted as an HTML document
          human   Easier readable by humans
          tsv     TAB-separated (good for machines)

   General options
       -h  Print a brief usage message and exits.

       -help
           Print a brief usage message with options and exits.

       -man
           Print a full usage message and exits.

       -version
           Print the version and exits.
