DESCRIPTION
       The period 2 turning (i.e. the edges turn with 180 degree intervals)
       was suggested by Derek Bosch <bosch@sgi.com>.  The physical puzzle has
       period 3 turning (i.e. the points turn with 120 degree intervals) is
       called a Triangle - 4 Cube - Dinosaur with colored dinosaurs on it, (or
       Triangle - 4 Cube - 6 Colors with solid colors, (a 4 color and a 2
       color are also available with point oriented coloring)) manufactured by
       The International Puzzle & Games (Great Animation International
       Corporation).

FEATURES
       Press "mouse-left" button to move a piece.  Release "mouse-left" button
       on a piece on the same face.  The pieces will then turn towards where
       the mouse button was released.

       Press "mouse-center", or press "P" or "p" keys to toggle the practice
       mode (in practice mode the record should say "practice").  One must
       double click on "mouse-center" if the puzzle is being worked on.  This
       is good for learning moves and experimenting.

       Click "mouse-right", or press "R" or "r" keys to randomize (this must
       be done first to set a new record).  One must double click on "mouse-
       right" if the puzzle is being worked on.

       Press "O" or "o" keys to toggle the orient mode.  One has to orient the
       faces in orient mode, besides getting all the faces to be the same
       color.  To do this one has to get the lines to be oriented in the same
       direction, this only matters with center diamond piece.  This does add
       complexity (ever so slightly, there are only 2 possibilities) so there
       are 2 sets of records.

       Press "2", "3", "B", or "b" keys (not the keypad 2, 3) to change modes
       to Period 2, Period 3, or Both.

       "S" or "s" keys reserved for the auto-solver (unimplemented).

       Press "U" or "u" keys to undo move.

       Press "G" or "g" keys to get a saved puzzle.

       Press "W" or "w" keys to write or save a puzzle.

       Press "Q", "q", or "CTRL-C" keys to kill program.

       Use the key pad, "R" keys, or arrow keys to move without mouse clicks.
       Key pad is defined for the Dino2d as:
       7 8 9   Upper Left, Up, Upper Right
         ^
       4< >6   Left, Clockwise, Right
         v
       1 2 3   Lower Left, Down, Lower Right
       Note: Top, Left, Right, and Bottom only work when the control key is
       pressed and there is no analog for Dino3d.

       Key pad for Dino3d, use must use your intuition (is this a cop out or
       what?).  The key pad is defined differently depending on which side of
       the cube your mouse is pointing at.

       Use the alt key and the left mouse button, keypad, or arrow keys to
       move the center of the cube.  The 2 opposite corners do not move.

       Use the shift keys and the left mouse button, keypad, or arrow key to
       access "Period 2" turns from "Both" mode, otherwise it assumes "Period
       3" turning.  Edges turn in "Period 2" and corners turn in "Period 3".
       The "Period 2" mode has extra cuts around the faces.

       Use the control  key and the left mouse button, keypad, or arrow keys
       to move the whole cube.  This is not recorded as a turn.

       The title is in the following format (non-motif version):
              xdino{2|3}d<dimension>.{2|3|both<turning modes>}: (<Number of
              moves>/{<Record number of moves> <username>|"NEVER
              noaccess"|"practice"}) - <Comment>
       If there is no record of the current puzzle, it displays "NEVER
       noaccess".

OPTIONS
       -geometry {+|-}X{+|-}Y
               This option sets the initial position of the dino window
               (resource name "geometry").

       -display host:dpy
               This option specifies the X server to contact.

       -[no]mono
               This option allows you to  display on a color screen as if
               monochrome (resource name "mono").

       -[no]{reverse|rv}
               This option allows you to see the dino window in reverse video
               (resource name "reverse").

       -{foreground|fg} color
               This option specifies the foreground of the dino window
               (resource name "foreground").

       -{background|bg} color
               This option specifies the background of the dino window
               (resource name "background").

       -{border|bd} color
               This option specifies the border color of the cubelets in the
               dino window (resource name "borderColor").

       -face{0|1|2|3|4|5} <color>
               This option allows you to change the color of a face (resource
               name "faceColorN"). In mono-mode, color is represented as the
               first letter of the color name. On the 2-D version, the faces
               are ordered top to bottom and left to right on the "t"
               configuration. The "+-" configuration is physically consistent
               with the former, so it is ordered "0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 4".  If you
               has two colors that begin with the same letter you should have
               one in uppercase and one in lowercase to distinguish them in
               mono-mode. You can change the colors of the faces to make a
               stupid cube (i.e. all White or in mono-mode all "W").
               Unfortunately, it will not normally say its solved when its
               randomized. This would be cheating.

       -mode <int>
               This option allows you to set the turning mode (resource name
               "mode").

       -both   This option allows you to set the turning mode to both period 2
               and period 3 (resource name "mode" set at 4).

       -[no]orient
               This option allows you to access the orient mode (resource name
               "orient").

       -[no]practice
               This option allows you to access the practice mode (resource
               name "practice").

       -username string
               This option specifies the user name for any records made or
               else it will get your login name (resource name "userName").

SAVE FORMAT
       The format is not standard.  The reason for this is that this is simple
       and I do not know what the standard is.

              mode: 2-4 <period 2 turning, period 3 turning, or both (4)>
              orient: 0-1 <O false, 1 true; if 1 then lines on pieces are to
              be oriented>
              practice: 0-1 <0 false, 1 true>
              moves: 0-MAXINT <total number of moves>

              startingPosition: <2 dimensional array of face and edge
              position, each face 4 edge pieces, if orient mode then
              orientation number follows face number: 0 up, 1 right, 2 down,
              and 3 left>

       This is then followed by the moves, starting from 1.
              move #: <face> <edge> <direction> <style> <control>
       Each turn is with respect to a corner on a face.
       The edges start at the top and work clockwise.
       Direction is represented as 0 upper right, 1 lower right, 2 lower left,
       3 upper left, 5 clockwise, 7 counterclockwise, 8 up, 9 right, 10 down,
       and 11 left.
       Style is represented as 0, 1, or 2, 0 if just a corner is rotated, 1 if
       the center of the cube is moved, and 2 if a period 2 twist.
       Control is represented as 0 or 1, 1 if the whole cube is moved at once
       (here the edge does not matter), 0 if not.  The xdino record keeper
       does not count a control move as a move, but here we do.

       Caution: the program may crash on corrupted input.
