NAME
       Net::Identica - A perl interface to the Identi.ca Twitter Compatible
       API

VERSION
       version 4.01043

SYNOPSIS
         use Net::Identica;

         $nt = Net::Identica->new(username => $user, password => $passwd);

         $nt->update('Hello, Identica friends!');

DEPRECATED
       This module is a backwards compatibility wrapper for applications that
       used Net::Identica packaged with "Net::Twitter" versions 2.12 and
       earlier.  Instead, use Net::Twitter with the "identica" option to gain
       all of the new features and functionality (OAuth, Search, exceptions on
       error, etc.).

         use Net::Twitter;

         # A simple, backwards compatible replacement for Net::Identica
         my $identica = Net::Twitter->new(
             legacy   => 1,
             identica => 1,
             username => $username,
             password => $password,
         );

         # A more complex object with OAuth and some optional traits
         my $identica = Net::Twitter->new(
             traits => [qw/API::REST API::Search InflateObjects/],
             identica            => 1,
             consumer_key        => $consumer_key,
             consumer_secret     => $consumer_secret,
             access_token        => $token,
             access_token_secret => $token_secret,
         );

DESCRIPTION
       The micro-blogging service <http://identi.ca> provides a Twitter
       compatible API.  This module simply creates an instance of
       "Net::Twitter" with the "identica" option set.

       See Net::Twitter for full documentation.

METHODS
       new Creates a "Net::Twitter" object by call "new" in Net::Twitter with
           the "identica" option preset.
