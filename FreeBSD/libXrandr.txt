       } XRRScreenSize;

       } XRRScreenChangeNotifyEvent;

       The XRRScreenSize structure contains a possible root size in pixels and
       in millimeters.

       A XRRScreenChangeNotifyEvent is sent to a client that has requested
       notification whenever the screen configuration is changed. A client can
       perform this request by calling XRRSelectInput, passing the display,
       the root window, and the RRScreenChangeNotifyMask mask.

       XRRScreenConfiguration is an opaque data type containing the
       configuration information for a screen.

       Timestamps

       Time stamps are included and must be used to ensure the client is
       playing with a full deck: the screen may change properties on the fly
       and this ensures its knowledge of the configuration is up to date.
       This is to help issues when screens may become hot-pluggable in the
       future.


DESCRIPTION
       Xrandr is a simple library designed to interface the X Resize and
       Rotate Extension.  This allows clients to change the size and rotation
       of the root window of a screen, along with the ability to reflect the
       screen about either axis (if supported by the implementation).
       Rotation and reflection may be implemented by software and may result
       in slower performance if rotation and reflection are implemented in
       this fashion (as are all implementations as of October 2002).

       The Xrandr library does some minimal caching to avoid roundtrips to
       provide clients frequently used information.  See "The X Resize and
       Rotate Extension" for a detailed description; also note that depth
       switching, as described in the document is not implemented, and may (or
       may not) ever be implemented, as display memory is growing rapidly, and
       toolkits are already beginning to support migration, mitigating the
       need for depth switching.  If it is implemented in the future, we
       expect to do so via an upward compatible extension to the current
       library/protocol; functionality described here should continue to work.

       Rotation and reflection and how they interact can be confusing.  In
       Randr, the coordinate system is rotated in a counter-clockwise
       direction relative to the normal orientation.  Reflection is along the
       window system coordinate system, not the physical screen X and Y axis,
       so that rotation and reflection do not interact.  The other way to
       consider reflection is to treat it as specified in the "normal"
       orientation, before rotation.

       The XRRScreenChangeNotify event is sent to clients that ask to be
       informed whenever the root window configuration changes.  Configuration
       changes may include resolution, physical size, subpixel order (see
       XRender(3)), and rotation.  Note that changes to any or all of these
       could occur due to external events (user control in the X server, a
       different monitor/flat panel display being hot-plugged) and is not only
       the result of a protocol/library request to the X server.

       Additionally, to eliminate a potential race condition, this event may
       be generated immediately upon selecting for notification if the screen
       has changed since the client of Xrandr connected to the X server, to
       enable reliable screen resolution changing when a user may log in and
       change the configuration while one or many clients are starting up.

       Xlib notification

       Clients must call back into Xlib using XRRUpdateConfiguration when
       screen configuration change notify events are generated (or root window
       configuration changes occur, to update Xlib's view of the resolution,
       size, rotation, reflection or subpixel order.  Generally, toolkits will
       perform this operation on behalf of applications; we did not want to
       change display structure data behind the back of toolkits, as in
       multithreaded clients, various race conditions might occur.  Toolkits
       should provide clients some mechanism for notification of screen
       change, of course.


FUNCTIONS
       There are two classes of interfaces: those which can be safely called
       even if RandR is not implemented on a screen (to make common idioms not
       dependent on the server having support), and those which will return
       errors if the extension is not present.

       XRRRotations returns both the possible set of rotations/reflections
       supported (as a bitmask) as the value of the function, along with the
       current rotation/reflection of the screen.

       XRRSizes returns the size and a pointer to the current sizes supported
       by the specified screen.  The first size specified is the default size
       of the server. If RandR is not supported, it returns 0 for the number
       of sizes.

       XRRRates returns a pointer to the rates supported by the specified
       size.  If RandR is not supported, it returns 0 for the number of rates.

       XRRTimes returns the time last reported by the server along with the
       timestamp the last configuration changed.  If the configuration has
       changed since the client last updated its view of the server time,
       requests to change the configuration will fail until the client has an
       up to date timestamp.

       XRRRootToScreen returns the screen number given a root window (for
       example, from an XRRScreenChangeNotifyEvent).

       The rest of the functions will fail if applied to screens not
       implementing the RandR extension.  XRRSetScreenConfig sets the screen
       size and rotation and reflection to the desired values on the screen
       specified by draw, or returns a BadValue error.  size_index specifies
       which size configuration is to be used, rotation specifies which
       rotation or reflection is to be used (or a BadValue error is returned).
       The timestamp is used by the server to make sure the client has up to
       date configuration information. Status is returned to indicate success
       or failure; a client must refresh its configuration information if it
       fails and try the call again (by calling XRRGetScreenInfo).

       XRRSetScreenConfigAndRate is like XRRSetScreenConfig but also sets the
       refresh rate. If specified rate is not supported a BadValue error is
       returned.

       XRRConfigRotations, XRRConfigSizes, XRRConfigCurrentConfiguration,
       XRRConfigTimes, XRRConfigRates, and XRRConfigCurrentRate are used to
       get specific configuration information out of a screen configuration.

       XRRGetScreenInfo returns a screen configuration for later use; the
       information is private to the library.  Call XRRFreeScreenConfigInfo to
       free this information when you are finished with it.  It forces a round
       trip to the server.

       Other functions include: XRRQueryExtension which returns the event and
       error base codes, XRRQueryVersion , which returns the current version
       of the extension (this information is cached by the library).

RESTRICTIONS
       Xrandr will remain upward compatible after the current 1.0 release.
