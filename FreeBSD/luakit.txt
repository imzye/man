NAME
       Luakit - Fast, small, WebKit based browser framework extensible by Lua.

SYNOPSIS
       luakit [OPTION] [URI]

DESCRIPTION
       Luakit is a highly configurable, browser framework based on the WebKit
       web content engine and the GTK+ toolkit. It is very fast, extensible by
       Lua and licensed under the GNU GPLv3 license. It is primarily targeted
       at power users, developers and any people with too much time on their
       hands who want to have fine-grained control over their web browsers
       behaviour and interface.

   Modes
       Luakit can run in various modes, which specify how the user interacts
       with the browser.

       Normal mode
              This is the default mode when Luakit is started. You can load
              URIs, open tabs and windows, access to other modes, etc.

       All mode
              Special meta-mode in which the bindings are present in all
              modes.

       Insert mode
              When selecting form fields Luakit will enter the insert mode
              which allows you to enter text in form fields without
              accidentally triggering normal mode bindings.

       Passthrough mode
              Luakit will pass every key event to the WebView until the user
              presses Escape. This is useful for using webpage shortcuts.

       Command mode
              Enter commands. Every action in Luakit is a command, so
              basically you can do anything from there.

       Lua mode
              Execute arbitrary Lua commands within the Luakit environment.

   Userscripts
       Luakit is highly extensible with userscripts written in Lua. These
       scripts may provide additional modes. Some are embedded by default. You
       will need to load the userscript to use its features. See the
       CONFIGURATION section for more details.

KEYBINDINGS
       Luakit is fully usable with keyboard. Default bindings should be
       familiar to users of Emacs and Vim; nonetheless a lot of keyboards and
       mouse shortcuts are shared with popular web browsers.

       Pressing : will open the command prompt. You can enter commands from
       there.  You can view the current list of bindings in Luakit's help page
       with the

              :help

       command.

       Some bindings have an uppercase version which will behave somewhat
       differently. Some come with userscripts, so you will need to have the
       appropriate userscript loaded to use it.  Here follows a list of some
       noteworthy default bindings.

       ZZ     Quit and save the session.

       ZQ     Quit without saving the session.

       o, O   Open specified URIs. If uppercase, edit current URI.

       t, T   Open specified URIs in new tab. If uppercase, edit current URI.

              URI.

       i      Enter insert mode. In some case form fields may not receive
              characters; press an arrow key to insert characters correctly.

       /, ?   Search / reverse search for a string on current page.

       n, N   Find next / previous result from search.

COMMANDS
       All bindings actually refer to commands. However, some commands do not
       have bindings associated by default. If completion userscript is used,
       you can autocomplete commands by pressing <TAB> by default. Once again,
       you should consult the configuration files to get an exhaustive list.
       The currently available functions may be displayed from the help view,
       which you can open with the :help command.

       Here follows some noteworthy commands:

       :bookmarks
              Display and search bookmarks.

       :downloads
              Open Download page, which displays all downloads along with
              their status.

       :dump  Download current page.

       :save  Save the complete page as a single mhtml file.

       :help  Display all commands and bindings, along with their description.
              The help page also features some details about modes.

       :history
              Display and search history.

       :inspect
              Launch WebKit inspector.  Use :inspect! to toggle off.

       :nohlsearch
              Disable search highlighting.

       :qmarks
              Display the quickmarks list.

              Display page source code.  Use :view-source! to toggle off.

FILES
       Luakit will load configuration files from the following folders in
       priority order:

              $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/luakit

              $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/luakit

       Default configuration files:

       binds.lua
              The keyboard and mouse bindings.

       globals.lua
              General configuration, like home page, search engines, user
              agent, per-domain properties, cookies policy.

       modes.lua
              All default modes are set in this file.

       rc.lua Main configuration files. All other files are loaded from there.

       theme.lua,
              Colors definition.

       webview.lua
              WebKit related.

       window.lua
              Status bar, windows and tabs behaviour.

       Embedded userscript will be loaded from $XDG_DATA_DIRS/luakit/lib.

       All browsing-related files are stored in $XDG_DATA_HOME/luakit.  All of
       are created if needed and if they do not exist. Depending on the
       userscripts you are using, you may find:

       bookmarks.db
              An SQLite3 database containing your complete bookmark list. If
              you want to synchronise your bookmarks between your different
              systems, just share this file. You can use a symbolic link if
              the file is not stored in the required folder.

       cookies.db
              This file contains all details needed for websites keeping track
              of your status, like login information. Delete this file once
              you are finished with browsing if you are not on your personal
              system.

       history.db
              Your browsing history.  Delete this file once you are finished
              with browsing if you are not on your personal system.

       quickmarks
              A plain text file saving your quickmarks. The structure is
              extremely simple: each line is a single quickmark; first
              character is the quickmark shortcut and may be one of [a-zA-
              Z0-9]; second character is a space; the remaining part is the
              URI.

CONFIGURATION
       If you do not want to stick to the default configuration and want to
       benefit from the flexibility and extensibility of Luakit, you can fully
       configure it from the Lua configuration files.

       If you do not want to start from scratch, you may use default
       configuration files and tweak them to fit your needs. Use the following
       command to copy configuration file to your home folder:

              cp -r $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/luakit $XDG_CONFIG_HOME

       You can now edit the new files. Configuration should be quite
       straightforward, even if you do not know much about Lua.
