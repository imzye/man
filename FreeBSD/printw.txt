NAME
       printw, wprintw, mvprintw, mvwprintw, vwprintw, vw_printw - print
       formatted output in curses windows

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curses.h>

       int printw(const char *fmt, ...);
       int wprintw(WINDOW *win, const char *fmt, ...);
       int mvprintw(int y, int x, const char *fmt, ...);
       int mvwprintw(WINDOW *win, int y, int x, const char *fmt, ...);
       int vw_printw(WINDOW *win, const char *fmt, va_list varglist);

       /* obsolete */
       int vwprintw(WINDOW *win, const char *fmt, va_list varglist);

DESCRIPTION
       The printw, wprintw, mvprintw and mvwprintw routines are analogous to
       printf [see printf(3)].  In effect, the string that would be output by
       printf is output instead as though waddstr were used on the given
       window.

       The vwprintw and wv_printw routines are analogous to vprintf [see
       printf(3)] and perform a wprintw using a variable argument list.  The
       third argument is a va_list, a pointer to a list of arguments, as
       defined in <stdarg.h>.

RETURN VALUE
       Routines that return an integer return ERR upon failure and OK (SVr4
       only specifies "an integer value other than ERR") upon successful
       completion.

       X/Open defines no error conditions.  In this implementation, an error
       may be returned if it cannot allocate enough memory for the buffer used
       to format the results.  It will return an error if the window pointer
       is null.

       Functions with a “mv” prefix first perform a cursor movement using
       wmove, and return an error if the position is outside the window, or if
       the window pointer is null.

PORTABILITY
       In this implementation, vw_printw and vwprintw are equivalent, to
       support legacy applications.  However, the latter (vwprintw) is
       obsolete:

       •   The XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 described these functions.  The
           function vwprintw is marked TO BE WITHDRAWN, and is to be replaced
           by a function vw_printw using the <stdarg.h> interface.

       •   The Single Unix Specification, Version 2 states that vw_printw  is
           preferred to vwprintw since the latter requires including
           <varargs.h>, which cannot be used in the same file as <stdarg.h>.
           This implementation uses <stdarg.h> for both, because that header
           is included in <curses.h>.

       •   X/Open Curses, Issue 5 (December 2007) marked vwprintw (along with
           vwscanw and the termcap interface) as withdrawn.
