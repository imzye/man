DHCP_PROBE.CF(5)          FreeBSD File Formats Manual         DHCP_PROBE.CF(5)

NAME
       dhcp_probe.cf - configuration file for dhcp_probe

SYNPOSIS
       /etc/dhcp_probe.cf

DESCRIPTION
       The file /etc/dhcp_probe.cf contains configuration information used by
       the dhcp_probe(8) daemon.  dhcp_probe reads the file when it begins
       (and whenever it receives a SIGHUP signal).

       The location of this file defaults to /etc/dhcp_probe.cf, but may be
       overridden by a command-line option to dhcp_probe(8).

       The file consists of a series of statements, one per line.  Each
       statement begins with a keyword followed by one or more arguments
       (depending on the keyword); keywords and arguments are separated by
       spaces or tabs.  Statements may be specified in any order.

       Some keywords take an ethernet-address argument.  Ethernet address
       values must be written in a form that ether_aton(3) recognizes; e.g.
       1:2:3:4:5:6 or 00:A5:b2:0:BB:c.

       Some keywords take an ip-address as a value.  IP address values must be
       written in a form that inet_aton(3) recognizes; e.g.  192.168.1.2.

       Blank lines are ignored.  Lines for which the first non-blank character
       is a '#' are treated as comments.  Trailing comments on statements are
       not supported.

       Because all presently-defined keywords are optional, the file may be
       empty, however, it must exist.

KEYWORDS
       The keywords are as follows:

   chaddr

              The chaddr statement is optional, and is used to specify the
              value of the chaddr field in the request packets sent by the
              program.  This value is also used to compute the DHCP Client
              Identifier option in some of the request packets sent by the
              program (by prepending x'01').

              Specify:

                     chaddr ethernet-address

              If not specified, this value defaults to the Ethernet address
              corresponding to the interface you specified on the commandline.

              You might want to use the chaddr statement if the interface is
              also a DHCP client, so that sending requests with the
              interface's own chaddr/DHCP Client Identifier will not interfere
              with that functionality.

              If you specify a value, be sure to specify a unicast Ethernet
              address that does not belong to any valid client on your
              network.

              Correctly-functioning BootP and DHCP servers that respond will
              send any responses to the chaddr address, or in some cases, to
              the Ethernet broadcast address.  Therefore, if you specify a
              value here (and it differs from your interface's Ethernet
              address), the program will have to place the interface into
              promiscuous mode to be sure it hears unicast responses.

              Note that the chaddr value does not affect the Ethernet source
              address of the Ethernet frames sent by the program.

              If you specify this value, you may also wish to specify the same
              value in the ether_src statement.  See the description of that
              statement for further discussion.

              The chaddr statement is required if
              do_not_lookup_enet_and_ip_addresses is specified.

   ether_src

              The ether_src statement is optional, and is used to specify the
              value of the ether_src field in the Ethernet frames sent by the
              program.

              Specify:

                     ether_src ethernet-address

              If not specified, this value defaults to the Ethernet address
              corresponding to the interface you specified on the commandline.

              If you specify a value, be sure to specify a unicast Ethernet
              address that does not belong to any valid client on your
              network.

              Note that this value does not affect the chaddr field or the
              DHCP Client Identifier option field in request packets sent by
              the program.

              If you specified a chaddr value, you may also wish to specify an
              equal ether_src value.  While not strictly necessary, doing so
              will cause any Layer 2 switches on the network to learn that
              this hardware address is on your leg of the network, so they
              will not need to flood response packets directed to that
              hardware address, but instead can direct the response packets
              only to your leg of the network.

              Additionally, specifying the same ether_src value could help you
              discover any buggy BootP or DHCP servers that mistakenly direct
              their responses to the sender's ether_src (instead of to the
              sender's bootp_chaddr).

              The ether_src statement is required if
              do_not_lookup_enet_and_ip_addresses is specified.

   do_not_lookup_enet_and_ip_addresses

              The do_not_lookup_enet_and_ip_addresses statement is optional.
              When not specified, the program will try to look up the Ethernet
              address of the network interface specified on the commandline.
              (It does so by querying the operating system for this
              information.)  In order to do so, it may need to first look up
              the IP address of the network interface specified on the
              commandline.  Performing either operation may be troublesome on
              some interfaces or platforms.  Failure of these lookups is a
              fatal error.

              Specifying do_not_lookup_enet_and_ip_addresses instructs the
              program to not try to look up the interface's Ethernet address
              and IP address.

              If do_not_lookup_enet_and_ip_addresses is specified, then both
              ether_src and chaddr must be specified.

              Specifying do_not_lookup_enet_and_ip_addresses may allow use of
              this program on interfaces configured with no IP address.

   server_id

              The server_id statement is optional, and is used to specify the
              value of the DHCP Server Identifer option in some of the request
              packets sent by the program.

              Specify:

                     server_id ip-address

              If not specified, this value defaults to 10.254.254.254.

              The DHCP Server Identifer option appears in the packets the
              program sends when it mimics a DHCP client in the SELECTING
              state.

              It's best that the DHCP Server Identifier option the program
              uses not match the IP address of any valid DHCP server on your
              network, to avoid confusing them.  Other than that, any IP
              address is a reasonable value; you may wish to specify one that
              could never be a valid address on your network.

   client_ip_address

              The client_ip_address statement is optional, and is used to
              specify the IP address that the program should request, or claim
              to have a lease on.

              Specify:

                     client_ip_address ip-address

              If not specified, this value defaults to 172.31.254.254.

              When the program generates a DHCPREQUEST packet that mimics a
              DHCP client that is in the INIT-REBOOT or SELECTING state, the
              packet contains a Requested IP Address option containing this
              value.  When the program generates a DHCPREQUEST packet that
              mimics a DHCP client that is in the REBINDING state, the packet
              contains a ciaddr field containing this value.

              It's best that the value the program uses not match the IP
              address of any valid DHCP client on your network, to avoid
              confusing valid DHCP servers.

              It's extremely useful if the value the program uses not be valid
              (topologically speaking) for the physical network on which the
              program sends the packets.  Sending a topologically
              inappropriate value may stimulate some DHCP servers to respond
              with a DHCPNAK, which helps the program flush out DHCP servers.

   response_wait_time

              The response_wait_time statement is optional, and is used to
              specify how long the program should wait for responses after
              sending a single request packet.

              Specify

                     response_wait_time num_milliseconds

              If not specified, this value defaults to 5000 milliseconds (5
              seconds).

              The value is specified in milliseconds, and must fit into an
              'int' on your host.  (Values larger than an 'int' may be
              silently misinterpreted.)  Typical values are on the order of a
              few thousand milliseconds; i.e. several seconds.

   cycle_time

              The cycle_time statement is optional, and is used to specify how
              long the program should sleep between each probe cycle.

              Specify

                     cycle_time num_seconds

              If not specified, this value defaults to 300 seconds.

              The value is specified in seconds, and must into into an
              'unsigned int' on your host.  (Values larger than an 'unsigned
              int' may be silently misinterpreted.)  Typical valus range from
              several hundred to several thousand seconds (i.e. several
              minutes to several hours).

              During each probe cycle, the program sends one of the request
              packet flavors, captures any responses that arrive during the
              response_wait_time, then repeats this for each of the other
              request packet flavors.  After doing this for each flavor of
              request packet, the probe cycle is complete, and the program
              sleeps for the cycle_time.

   legal_server

              The legal_server statement is optional, and is used to specify
              the IP source address of responses that come from a legal BootP
              or DHCP server on your network.  The statement may be specified
              multiple times.

              Specify

                     legal_server ip-address

              If not specified, the program assumes there are no legal BootP
              and DHCP servers on your network; all responses will be treated
              as coming from an unknown DHCP server.

              When the program receives a response packet, it compares the
              packet's IP source address to all the addresses you have
              specified in legal_server statements.  If the IP source address
              matches one of these values, the response is deemed to have come
              from a known DHCP server, and is ignored.  If the IP source
              address does not match any of these values (or you do not
              specify any legal_server), then the program logs a message that
              reports the packet's IP source address and Ethernet source
              address.  Additionally, if the program was started with the -o
              commandline option, the packet is also written to a packet
              capture file.

              If both legal_server and legal_server_ethersrc statements
              appear, then a response must have both a valid IP source and a
              valid ethernet source to be considered to have come from a known
              DHCP server.

              When relaying a response from a server to a client, some BootP
              Relay Agents may change the response's IP source address,
              replacing the server's IP address with that of the BootP Relay
              Agent.  If BootP Relay Agents on your network do this, you will
              need to specify their IP addresses here instead.

   legal_server_ethersrc

              The legal_server_ethersrc statement is optional, and is used to
              specify the Ethernet source address of responses that come from
              a legal BootP or DHCP server on your network.  The statement may
              be specified multiple times.

              Specify

                     legal_server_ethersrc ethernet-address

              If not specified, the program does not check the Ethernet source
              address of responses.

              If you have specified at least one legal_server_ethersrc value,
              when the program receives a response packet, the program
              compares the packet's Ethernet source address to all the
              addresses you have specified in legal_server_ethersrc
              statements.  If the Ethernet source does not match one of these
              values, the response is deemed to have come from an unknown DHCP
              server; the program logs a message that reports the packet's IP
              source address and Ethernet source address.  Additionally, if
              the program was started with the -o commandline option, the
              packet is also written to a packet capture file.

              If both legal_server and legal_server_ethersrc statements
              appear, then a response must have both a valid IP source and a
              valid ethernet source to be considered to have come from a known
              DHCP server.

              Each router on the path from the DHCP server to the DHCP client
              will overwrite the Ethernet source address field.  So if you
              specify any legal_server_ethersrc statements, also list the
              Ethernet source value(s) for the last hop router(s).  A BootP
              Relay Agent on the path from the DHCP server to the DHCP client
              will overwrite the Ethernet field.  So also list the Ethernet
              source value(s) for the BootP Relay Agent.  (The BootP Relay
              Agent is often co-resident in the last-hop IP router, so you may
              have already taken care of this when you listed the last-hop
              router(s).

              The legal_server_ethersrc statement is considered experimental
              in versions 1.3.0 - 1.3.1, as it has received only limited
              testing.

   lease_network_of_concern

              The lease_network_of_concern statement is optional, and may be
              specified multiple times.  The statement is used to specify one
              or more network ranges that are of concern relative to the IP
              addresses distributed by a rogue BootP/DHCP server.

              Specify

                     lease_network_of_concern network-ip-address network-mask

              Specifying one or more lease_network_of_concern statements
              activates the "Lease Networks of Concern" feature.

              When the program receives a response packet that it determines
              to be from a rogue BootP/DHCP server, if the "Lease Networks of
              Concern" feature is active, the program will examine the packet
              further.  If the packet's yiaddr field is non-zero, the value in
              that field is tested to see if it falls within any of the
              "Leases Networks of Concern."  If it does, then the message the
              program logs is extended to also report this fact, and to
              include the value of the yiaddr field.  Furthermore, if an
              alert_program_name2 was specified, when that program is called,
              it is called with an additional -y yiaddr option.  (This is not
              supported if an alert_program_name was specified, as the older
              alert_program_name uses a syntax that cannot be extended.)

              The "Lease Networks of Concern" feature does not change the way
              the program probes for or detects rogue BootP/DHCP servers.
              Upon detection of a rogue BootP/DHCP server, the feature only
              may cause additional information to be added to the message
              logged (and passed to alert_program_name2).

              This feature may be used, for example, by specifying your
              networks' legitimate address ranges as "Lease Networks of
              Concern".  While most rogue BootP/DHCP servers distribute
              private IP addresses, or send DHCPNAKs to legitimate clients,
              other more damaging rogue BootP/DHCP servers may distribute IP
              addresses that fall within your legitimate network ranges.  This
              will help differentiate those more damaging incidents from the
              more common ones.

   alert_program_name

              The alert_program_name statement is optional, and may be used to
              specify the name of an external program that should be run every
              time a response packet is received from an unexpected server.

              Note that using the newer alert_program_name2 statement is
              preferrable.

              Specify

                     alert_program_name /absolute/path/name

              Unexpected response packets are reported as a matter of course,
              and optionally written to a packet capture file.  You may use an
              alert_program_name to provide additional handling of the event,
              for example, to alert an appropriate party via mail or paging.
              The alert_program_name you specify is called with four arguments
              in the following order: the name of the calling program (e.g.
              dhcp_probe), the name of the interface on which the unexpected
              response packet was received, the IP source address of the
              packet, and the Ethernet source address of the packet.

              As the alert_program_name is called with the same privileges as
              dhcp_probe (i.e. root), you should exercise caution to ensure
              that the alert program is safe for a privileged user to execute.

              Because the syntax supported by the external program is not
              extensible, the use of alert_program_name2 is preferrable.

              You may not specify both alert_program_name and
              alert_program_name2.

   alert_program_name2

              The alert_program_name2 statement is optional, and may be used
              to specify the name of an external program that should be run
              every time a response packet is received from an unexpected
              server.

              Specify

                     alert_program_name2 /absolute/path/name

              Unexpected response packets are reported as a matter of course,
              and optionally written to a packet capture file.  You may use an
              alert_program_name2 to provide additional handling of the event,
              for example, to alert an appropriate party via mail or paging.
              The alert_program_name2 you specify is called with the following
              required options:

                     -p the name of the calling program (e.g. dhcp_probe),
                     -I the name of the interface on which the unexpected response packet was received
                     -i the IP source address of the packet
                     -m Ethernet source address of the packet

              The following non-required options may also be passed:

                     -y the non-zero yiaddr value from the packet, when it falls inside a "Lease Network of Concern"

              The alert_program_name2 program you specify must ignore options
              or arguments it does not recognize; this is to ensure it remains
              forward-compatible with future enhancements to dhcp_probe.  It
              must be prepared to accept options in any order.

              As the alert_program_name2 is called with the same privileges as
              dhcp_probe (i.e. root), you should exercise caution to ensure
              that the alert program is safe for a privileged user to execute.

              You may not specify both alert_program_name and
              alert_program_name2.

EXAMPLE
       An example /etc/dhcp_probe.cf file follows:
