PMAP_REMOVE(9)         FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual        PMAP_REMOVE(9)

NAME
     pmap_remove, pmap_remove_all, pmap_remove_pages – remove pages from a
     physical map

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <vm/vm.h>
     #include <vm/pmap.h>

     void
     pmap_remove(pmap_t pmap, vm_offset_t sva, vm_offset_t eva);

     void
     pmap_remove_all(vm_page_t m);

     void
     pmap_remove_pages(pmap_t pmap);

DESCRIPTION
     The pmap_remove() function removes the range of addresses between sva and
     eva from the physical map pmap.  If eva is less than sva, then the result
     is undefined.  It is assumed that both sva and eva are page-aligned
     addresses.

     The pmap_remove_all() removes the physical page m from all physical maps
     in which it resides, and reflects back the modify bits to the appropriate
     pager.

     The pmap_remove_pages() function removes all user pages from the physical
     map pmap.  This function is called when a process exits to run down its
     address space more quickly than would be the case for calling
     pmap_remove().
