NAME
       Chemistry::Canonicalize - Number the atoms in a molecule in a unique
       way

SYNOPSIS
           use Chemistry::Canonicalize ':all';

           # $mol is a Chemistry::Mol object
           canonicalize($mol);
           print "The canonical number for atom 1 is: ",
               $mol->atoms(1)->attr("canon/class");
           print "The symmetry class for for atom 1 is: ",
               $mol->atoms(1)->attr("canon/symmetry_class");

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides functions for "canonicalizing" a molecular
       structure; that is, to number the atoms in a unique way regardless of
       the input order.

       The canonicalization algorithm is based on: Weininger, et. al., J.
       Chem. Inf.  Comp. Sci. 29[2], 97-101 (1989)

       This module is part of the PerlMol project, <http://www.perlmol.org/>.

ATOM ATTRIBUTES
       During the canonicalization process, the following attributes are set
       on each atom:

       canon/class
           The unique canonical number; it is an integer going from 1 to the
           number of atoms.

       canon/symmetry_class
           The symmetry class number. Atoms that have the same symmetry class
           are considered to be topologicaly equivalent. For example, the two
           methyl carbons on 2-propanol would have the same symmetry class.

FUNCTIONS
       These functions may be exported, although nothing is exported by
       default.

       canonicalize($mol, %opts)
           Canonicalizes the molecule. It adds the canon/class and
           canon/symmetry class to every atom, as discussed above. This
           function may take the following options:

           sort
               If true, sort the atoms in the molecule in ascending canonical
               number order.

           invariants
               This should be a subroutine reference that takes an atom and
               returns a number.  These number should be based on the
               topological invariant properties of the atom, such as symbol,
               charge, number of bonds, etc.

VERSION
       0.11

TO DO
       Add some tests.

CAVEATS
       Currently there is an atom limit of about 430 atoms.

       These algorithm is known to fail to discriminate between non-equivalent
       atoms for some complicated cases. These are usually highly bridged
       structures explicitly designed to break canonicalization algorithms; I
       don't know of any "real-looking structure" (meaning something that
       someone would actually synthesize or find in nature) that fails, but
       don't say I didn't warn you!
