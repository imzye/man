NAME
     moo – Marco's Object Oriented calculator

SYNOPSIS
     moo [-lsu] [-b base] [expr] [...]

DESCRIPTION
     A simple calculator that accepts C-like syntax as input.  Calculations
     are done on expr, if given.  Otherwise, the standard input is used.

     Numbers can be entered in hexadecimal (0xbeef), decimal (1984), octal
     (007), and binary (0b1001).  All numerical operators (+, -, *, /, %), bit
     operators (|, ^, &, ~, <<, >>), and logical operators (==, !=, <, >, <=,
     >=, !, &&, ||) are supported.

     Output will be in the same bases as the input, unless a different base
     was specified (see -b flag below).  If only one number is input, the
     result is printed in all bases.

     The options are:

     -b base
             Output numbers in base format.  base can be 2, 8, 10, 16, or
             `all'.  Multiple bases may be specified by giving the -b flag
             multiple times.

     -l      Output bit labels for binary results.

     -s      Output base 10 numbers as signed.

     -u      Output base 10 numbers as unsigned.

SEE ALSO
     bc(1), dc(1), expr(1)

AUTHORS
     moo was written for the public domain by Ray Lai ⟨ray@cyth.net⟩ after
     much whining by Marco Peereboom.

CAVEATS
     Integer overflows are not checked.  Marco says, ``I don't think you
     should call the integer overflows a bug but a feature.  You can use it to
     test signed unsigned issues.''

BUGS
     Calculations are limited to the size of a 64-bit integer.

     Like bc(1), moo parses ``3--2'' without error.
