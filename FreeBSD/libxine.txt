XINE(1)                 FreeBSD General Commands Manual                XINE(1)

NAME
       xine-config - script to get information about the installed version of
       libxine

SYNOPSIS
       xine-config [--prefix[=DIR]] [--exec-prefix[=DIR]] [--version] [--libs]
       [--cflags] [--objcflags] [--plugindir] [--datadir] [--scriptdir]
       [--localedir]

DESCRIPTION
       xine-config is DEPRECATED. Use pkg-config instead.

       xine-config is a tool that is used to determine the compiler and linker
       flags that should be used to compile and link programs that use
       libxine. It can also be used to determine the directories where libxine
       expects plugins.

OPTIONS
       xine-config accepts the following options, passing them on (possibly
       modified) to pkg-config libxine:

       --version
               --modversion
               Print the currently installed version of libxine on the
               standard output.

       --libs
       --cflags
       --objcflags
               Passed on unmodified.
               Print the compiler flags (for C and Objective C, respectively)
               that are necessary to compile a program that uses libxine.

       --bindir
       --plugindir
       --datadir
       --scriptdir
       --localedir
               --variable=...
               Print the directory where, respectively, libxine binaries,
               plugins, data files, scripts and locale data are
               stored/expected.

       --prefix=PREFIX
               --define-variable=prefix=PREFIX
               If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix
               that xine-lib was built with. This option is also used for the
               exec prefix if --exec-prefix was not specified.


       --exec-prefix=PREFIX
               --define-variable=exec_prefix=PREFIX
               If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation exec
               prefix that xine-lib was built with.
