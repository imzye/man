MADDR(1)                FreeBSD General Commands Manual               MADDR(1)

NAME
     maddr – extract mail addresses from messages

SYNOPSIS
     maddr [-ad] [-h headers] [msgs_...]

DESCRIPTION
     maddr prints, separated by newlines, all mail addresses found in the
     headers of the specified msgs.  (See mmsg(7) for the message argument
     syntax.)

     If no msgs are specified and maddr is used interactively, maddr will
     operate on the current sequence by default.  Otherwise, maddr will read
     filenames from the standard input.

     The options are as follows:

     -a      Only print the addr-spec address, not the display name.

     -d      Only print the display name.

     -h headers
             Only search the colon-separated list of headers for mail
             addresses.  Default: ‘from:sender:reply-to:to:cc:bcc:’ and their
             respective ‘resent-’ variants, if any.

EXIT STATUS
     The maddr utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
