NAME
       apm - Alliance ProMotion video driver

SYNOPSIS

         Driver "apm"

DESCRIPTION
       apm is an Xorg driver for Alliance ProMotion video cards. The driver is
       accelerated for supported hardware/depth combination. It supports
       framebuffer depths of 8, 15, 16, 24 and 32 bits. For 6420, 6422, AT24,
       AT3D and AT25, all depths are fully accelerated except 24 bpp for which
       only screen to screen copy and rectangle filling is accelerated.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
       The apm driver supports PCI and ISA video cards on the following
       Alliance ProMotion chipsets

       ProMotion 6420

       ProMotion 6422

       AT24

       AT3D

       AT25

CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for general configuration details.  This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The driver auto-detects the chipset type, but the following ChipSet
       names may optionally be specified in the config file "Device" section,
       and will override the auto-detection:

           "6422", "at24", "at3d".

           The AT25 is Chipset "at3d" and the 6420 is 6422.

           The driver will auto-detect the amount of video memory present for
           all chips. The actual amount of video memory can also be specified
           with a VideoRam entry in the config file "Device" section.

           The following driver Options are supported:

           Option "HWCursor" "boolean"
                  Enable or disable the hardware cursor.  Default: on.

           Option "NoAccel" "boolean"
                  Disable or enable acceleration.  Default: acceleration is
                  enabled.

           Option "PciRetry" "boolean"
                  Enable or disable PCI retries.  Default: off.

           Option "Remap_DPMS_On" "string"

           Option "Remap_DPMS_Standby" "string"

           Option "Remap_DPMS_Suspend" "string"

           Option "Remap_DPMS_Off" "string"
                  Remaps the corresponding DPMS events. I've found that my
                  Hercules 128/3D swaps Off and Suspend events. You can
                  correct that with
                         Option "Remap_DPMS_Suspend" "Off"
                         Option "Remap_DPMS_Off" "Suspend"
                  in the Device section of the config file.

                  Option "SWCursor" "boolean"
                         Force the software cursor.  Default: off.

                  Option "ShadowFB" "boolean"
                         Enable or disable use of the shadow framebuffer
                         layer.  Default: off.
