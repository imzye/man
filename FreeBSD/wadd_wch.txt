NAME
       add_wch, wadd_wch, mvadd_wch, mvwadd_wch, echo_wchar, wecho_wchar - add
       a complex character and rendition to a curses window, then advance the
       cursor

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curses.h>

       int add_wch( const cchar_t *wch );
       int wadd_wch( WINDOW *win, const cchar_t *wch );
       int mvadd_wch( int y, int x, const cchar_t *wch );
       int mvwadd_wch( WINDOW *win, int y, int x, const cchar_t *wch );
       int echo_wchar( const cchar_t *wch );
       int wecho_wchar( WINDOW *win, const cchar_t *wch );

DESCRIPTION
   add_wch
       The add_wch, wadd_wch, mvadd_wch, and mvwadd_wch functions put the
       complex character wch into the given window at its current position,
       which is then advanced.  These functions perform wrapping and special-
       character processing as follows:

       •   If wch refers to a spacing character, then any previous character
           at that location is removed.  A new character specified by wch is
           placed at that location with rendition specified by wch.  The
           cursor then advances to the next spacing character on the screen.

       •   If wch refers to a non-spacing character, all previous characters
           at that location are preserved.  The non-spacing characters of wch
           are added to the spacing complex character, and the rendition
           specified by wch is ignored.

       •   If the character part of wch is a tab, newline, backspace or other
           control character, the window is updated and the cursor moves as if
           addch were called.

   echo_wchar
       The echo_wchar function is functionally equivalent to a call to add_wch
       followed by a call to refresh(3X).  Similarly, the wecho_wchar is
       functionally equivalent to a call to wadd_wch followed by a call to
       wrefresh.  The knowledge that only a single character is being output
       is taken into consideration and, for non-control characters, a
       considerable performance gain might be seen by using the *echo*
       functions instead of their equivalents.

   Line Graphics
       Like addch(3X), addch_wch accepts symbols which make it simple to draw
       lines and other frequently used special characters.  These symbols
       correspond to the same VT100 line-drawing set as addch(3X).

       Unicode's descriptions for these characters differs slightly from
       ncurses, by introducing the term “light” (along with less important
       details).  Here are its descriptions for the normal, thick, and double
       horizontal lines:

       •   U+2500 BOX DRAWINGS LIGHT HORIZONTAL

       •   U+2501 BOX DRAWINGS HEAVY HORIZONTAL

       •   U+2550 BOX DRAWINGS DOUBLE HORIZONTAL

RETURN VALUE
       All routines return the integer ERR upon failure and OK on success.

       Functions with a “mv” prefix first perform a cursor movement using
       wmove, and return an error if the position is outside the window, or if
       the window pointer is null.

NOTES
       Note that add_wch, mvadd_wch, mvwadd_wch, and echo_wchar may be macros.

PORTABILITY
       All of these functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue
       4.  The defaults specified for line-drawing characters apply in the
       POSIX locale.

       X/Open Curses makes it clear that the WACS_ symbols should be defined
       as a pointer to cchar_t data, e.g., in the discussion of border_set.  A
       few implementations are problematic:

       •   NetBSD curses defines the symbols as a wchar_t within a cchar_t.

       •   HPUX curses equates some of the ACS_ symbols to the analogous WACS_
           symbols as if the ACS_ symbols were wide characters.  The
           misdefined symbols are the arrows and other symbols which are not
           used for line-drawing.

       X/Open Curses does not define symbols for thick- or double-lines.  SVr4
       curses implementations defined their line-drawing symbols in terms of
       intermediate symbols.  This implementation extends those symbols,
       providing new definitions which are not in the SVr4 implementations.

       Not all Unicode-capable terminals provide support for VT100-style
       alternate character sets (i.e., the acsc capability), with their
       corresponding line-drawing characters.  X/Open Curses did not address
       the aspect of integrating Unicode with line-drawing characters.
       Existing implementations of Unix curses (AIX, HPUX, Solaris) use only
       the acsc character-mapping to provide this feature.  As a result, those
       implementations can only use single-byte line-drawing characters.
       Ncurses 5.3 (2002) provided a table of Unicode values to solve these
       problems.  NetBSD curses incorporated that table in 2010.

       In this implementation, the Unicode values are used instead of the
       terminal description's acsc mapping as discussed in ncurses(3X) for the
       environment variable NCURSES_NO_UTF8_ACS.  In contrast, for the same
       cases, the line-drawing characters described in curs_addch(3X) will use
       only the ASCII default values.

       Having Unicode available does not solve all of the problems with line-
       drawing for curses:

       •   The closest Unicode equivalents to the VT100 graphics S1, S3, S7
           and S9 frequently are not displayed at the regular intervals which
           the terminal used.

       •   The lantern is a special case.  It originated with the AT&T 4410
           terminal in the early 1980s.  There is no accessible documentation
           depicting the lantern symbol on the AT&T terminal.

           Lacking documentation, most readers assume that a storm lantern was
           intended.  But there are several possibilities, all with problems.

           Unicode 6.0 (2010) does provide two lantern symbols: U+1F383 and
           U+1F3EE.  Those were not available in 2002, and are irrelevant
           since they lie outside the BMP and as a result are not generally
           available in terminals.  They are not storm lanterns, in any case.

           Most storm lanterns have a tapering glass chimney (to guard against
           tipping); some have a wire grid protecting the chimney.

           For the tapering appearance, ☃ U+2603 was adequate.  In use on a
           terminal, no one can tell what the image represents.  Unicode calls
           it a snowman.

           Others have suggested these alternatives: § U+00A7 (section mark),
           Θ U+0398 (theta), Φ U+03A6 (phi), δ U+03B4 (delta), ⌧ U+2327 (x in
           a rectangle), ╬ U+256C (forms double vertical and horizontal), and
           ☒ U+2612 (ballot box with x).
