NAME
       xtestpicture - draw a simple monitor test pattern

SYNOPSIS
       xtestpicture [-s[aturated]] [-d[isplay] display] [-v[ersion]]

DESCRIPTION
       This program creates a single window covering the whole screen, and
       draws several test patterns in it. The window is configured to be not
       intercepted by a window manager and raised to the top of the window
       stack, so it should be the only picture on the screen at all.

       A couple of lines between the opposite corners, two rectangles near the
       border of the screen, a single rectangle, and a circle in the middle of
       the screen are mainly useful for convergency and linearity
       considerations.

       A box with alternating black and white vertical lines above the center
       of the screen, two pixels thick on the left side and one pixel thick
       each on the right side is intented to evaluate the sharpness and
       bandwidth of the monitor.

       Finally, there's a box containing a palette of eight colors. These are
       the basic CRT colors red, green, and blue, along with their mutual
       mixture colors magenta, cyan, yellow, and white, accompanied by a black
       rectangle to complete the series. The colors are fully saturated in the
       top row, i. e. with 100 % intensity and not intermixed with white,
       while the saturation decreases in steps of 25 % towards the bottom row,
       which is plain gray scale (0 % saturation).

       Since this color palette causes a total cost of 32 color cells, it can
       be avoided by starting xtestpicture with the option -s[aturated].  This
       will cause the program to display only fully saturated colors.

       The program will exit if any pointer button is pressed.

       Specifying the option -v[ersion] will cause the program to print its
       version identification to stderr and exit.
