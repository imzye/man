NAME
       File::Slurper - A simple, sane and efficient module to slurp a file

VERSION
       version 0.014

SYNOPSIS
        use File::Slurper 'read_text';
        my $content = read_text($filename);

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides functions for fast and correct slurping and
       spewing. All functions are optionally exported. All functions throw
       exceptions on errors, write functions don't return any meaningful
       value.

FUNCTIONS
   read_text($filename, $encoding, $crlf)
       Reads file $filename into a scalar and decodes it from $encoding (which
       defaults to UTF-8). If $crlf is true, crlf translation is performed.
       The default for this argument is off. The special value 'auto' will set
       it to a platform specific default value.

   read_binary($filename)
       Reads file $filename into a scalar without any decoding or
       transformation.

   read_lines($filename, $encoding, $crlf, $skip_chomp)
       Reads file $filename into a list/array line-by-line, after decoding
       from $encoding, optional crlf translation and chomping. It will always
       use newline as separator.

   write_text($filename, $content, $encoding, $crlf)
       Writes $content to file $filename, encoding it to $encoding (which
       defaults to UTF-8). It can also take a "crlf" argument that works
       exactly as in read_text.

   write_binary($filename, $content)
       Writes $content to file $filename as binary data.

   read_dir($dirname)
       Open "dirname" and return all entries except "." and "..".

RATIONALE
       This module tries to make it as easy as possible to read and write
       files correctly and fast. The most correct way of doing this is not
       always obvious (e.g. #83126
       <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=83126>), and just as
       often the most obvious correct way is not the fastest correct way. This
       module hides away all such complications behind an easy intuitive
       interface.

DEPENDENCIES
       This module has an optional dependency on PerlIO::utf8_strict.
       Installing this will make UTF-8 encoded IO significantly faster, but
       should not otherwise affect the operation of this module. This may
       change into a dependency on the related Unicode::UTF8 in the future.

SEE ALSO
       •   Path::Tiny

           A minimalistic abstraction handling not only IO but also paths.

       •   IO::All

           An attempt to expose as many IO related features as possible via a
           single API.

       •   File::Slurp

           This is a previous generation file slurping module. It has a number
           of issues, as described here
           <http://blogs.perl.org/users/leon_timmermans/2015/08/fileslurp-is-
           broken-and-wrong.html>.

       •   File::Slurp::Tiny

           This was my previous attempt at a better file slurping module. It's
           mostly (but not entirely) a drop-in replacement for File::Slurp,
           which is both a feature (easy conversion) and a bug (interface
           issues).

TODO
       •   "open_text"/"open_binary"?

       •   "drain_handle"?
