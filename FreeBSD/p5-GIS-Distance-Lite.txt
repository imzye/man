NAME
       GIS::Distance::Lite - Calculate geographic distances between
       coordinates in geodetic WGS84 format.

SYNOPSIS
         use GIS::Distance::Lite qw(distance);

         my $distanceInMeters = distance($lat1, $lon1 => $lat2, $lon2);

DESCRIPTION
       The module provides a method to calculate geographic distances between
       coordinates in geodetic WGS84 format using the Haversine formula.

       It is similar to GIS::Distance, but without the extra bells and
       whistles and without the additional dependencies. Same great taste,
       less filling.  It exists for those who cannot, or prefer not to install
       Moose and its dependencies.

       my $distanceInMeters = GIS::Distance::Lite::distance($lat1, $lon1 =>
       $lat2, $lon2);
         Calculate distance between two set of coordinates.

         Parameters:

          $latitude1  (number)
          $longitude1 (number)
          $latitude2  (number)
          $longitude2 (number)

         Example:

          my $distanceInMeters = GIS::Distance::Lite::distance(59.26978, 18.03948 => 59.27200, 18.05375);

         Returns:

         the distance in meters;
