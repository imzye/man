SL2TPS(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              SL2TPS(1)

NAME
     sl2tps – simple L2TP server

SYNOPSIS
     sl2tps [-D] [-f config.xml]

DESCRIPTION
     sl2tps is a simple, statically configured L2TP server basd on libpdel(3).
     The server is configured by manually editing an XML configuration file.

     sl2tps supports fixed or dynamically assigned IP address assignments for
     each user.  A user may not connect to the server multiple times
     simultaneously (not counting multi-link PPP connections that are part of
     the same bundle).

     sl2tps supports 128-bit Microsoft MPPE encryption if requested by the
     client.  If the client's assigned IP address matches a local subnet,
     sl2tps will automatically proxy-ARP for the remote client.

     Configuration file parameters are documented in the example configuration
     file /usr/local/etc/sl2tps/config.xml.sample.  Refer to that file for
     specifics about configuration.

     The options are as follows:

     -D      Run in debug mode: don't fork into the background and enable
             typed memory statistics.

     -f      Specify a configuration file other than the default,
             /usr/local/etc/sl2tps/config.xml.

FILES
     /usr/local/etc/sl2tps/config.xml  Default configuration file.
