PWD_UNMKDB(8)           FreeBSD System Manager's Manual          PWD_UNMKDB(8)

NAME
     pwd_unmkdb – build plain-text password file from database

SYNOPSIS
     pwd_unmkdb [-i db-file] [-o out-file]

DESCRIPTION
     The pwd_unmkdb utility reads through a db(3) style secure password
     database generated by pwd_mkdb(8).  It uses this info to generate the
     plaintext master.passwd(5) style file that was used to create it.

     By default, it reads the file spwd.db in the current directory, and
     outputs into master.passwd, also in the current directory.

     The options are as follows:

     -i db-file
           Use the specified db file as the source, instead of the default
           spwd.db.

     -o out-file
           Output into the specified file, instead of the default
           master.passwd.

     A simple, tool, to be sure.  However, it's extremely useful if you lose
     or corrupt /etc/master.passwd somehow.  I know I've done it a few times
     by fat-fingering in vipw(8), and it's surprisingly common to b0rk it when
     using mergemaster(8).  You can recover from backups the nightly runs
     make, but you lose changes since then.  Using pwd_unmkdb lets you get
     exactly what the system is using, in a format you can work with.

     The pwd_unmkdb utility exits zero on success, non-zero on failure.

FILES
     spwd.db        The default secure password database file used as the
                    source.
     master.passwd  The default flat-text password file the info is output
                    into.
