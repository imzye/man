XML::Parser::Style::EasyTree(3)            User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       XML::Parser::Style::EasyTree - Parse xml to simple tree

VERSION
       Version 0.08

PLEASE USE ETREE
       This module intersects with XML::Parser::EasyTree (I didn't found it
       before commit because of missing '::Style' in it's name)

       But since we are using same style name, we're mutual exclusive ;(

       It is leaved as a compatibility wrapper to XML::Parser::Style::ETree
       (If you use it, all your code will keep working)

       XML::Parser::Style::ETree is included in this distribution

       But I recommend to use "ETree" instead

       All documentation look in XML::Parser::Style::ETree
