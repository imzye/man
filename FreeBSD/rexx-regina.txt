regina(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              regina(1)

Name
       regina - The Regina Rexx Interpreter

Syntax
       regina [ options ] [ script [ scriptparams ]]

       rexx [ options ] [ script [ scriptparams ]]

Description
       regina will read the file named as script and will assume the contents
       of that file to be a Rexx program and will interpret that program. Any
       parameters following script will be interpreted as the parameters to
       the Rexx program. If script is not specified, or is specified as `-',
       the Rexx program to interpret will be read from standard input, and
       interpretation will start when the whole program has been read.

       The regina executable supports the use of external function packages
       written to the SAA API, and loaded with the RxFuncAdd BIF.

       The rexx executable does not support the use of external function
       packages written to the SAA API, but executes slightly faster than the
       regina executable.


Options
       -tx    Sets tracing of the program to the option(s); "x" specified. Any
              TRACE commands in the program will be ignored.  If you want to
              run your program with tracing set to "Intermediate", you can use
              the option -ti.  If only -t is specified, "All" is the trace
              mode set.  Multiple tracing options can be specified. eg. To
              specify "intermediate", "interactive" tracing, specify -ti -t?.


       -i     Starts Regina in interactive mode. No script will be executed.


       -v     Displays Regina version and exits.


       -a     Changes the way that arguments passed on the command line are
              made available to the called Rexx program. With this switch each
              parameter on the command line is available as a separate
              argument, rather then the normal behaviour of only making the
              combined command line arguments available as one internal
              argument.


       -l[locale]
              Allows the user to specify the locale to be used. Normally this
              switch is specified without the optional locale string which
              uses the system's locale.


       -p     Relevant only on Win32 platforms. Results in a `Press ENTER key
              to exit...'  prompt to be displayed at the end of execution.
              This is useful when a Rexx program is run from Windows Explorer.


       -r     Runs a Rexx program is a restricted mode where any no changes to
              the external environment are allowed. Writing to files, loading
              external function packages, and running external commands are
              prohibited.


       -ooptions
              Allows Regina OPTIONS to be passed to the Rexx program. The
              value of options is in the same format as the OPTIONS
              instruction.


       -c     Compiles the specified script to a tokenised image and writes
              the image to an output file which is the the only other
              parameter allowed to be supplied.


       -e     Executes the specified script as a tokenised image. All other
              switches above are allowed.  The tokenised image is not allowed
              to be supplied via stdin.



Built-ins
       Below is a list of all the standard built-in functions in Rexx. For a
       more complete description of each function, see the documentation
       accompanying Regina.


       ABBREV(long,short[,length])
              Returns `1' or 0', depending on whether short is an abbreviation
              of long , or at least length characters.


       ABS(number)
              Returns the absolute value of number.


       ADDRESS()
              Returns the name of the current environment.


       ARG([argno[,option]])
              Without parameters, it returns the number of parameters. If only
              `argno' is specified, it must be a number, and that parameter is
              returned. `Option' can be `E', `N' or `O', and then either `0'
              or `1' is returned, depending on whether the numbered parameter
              existed or was omitted. The option `N' is the same as not
              specifying an option.


       B2X(binstring)
              Converts the bin-string `binstring' to a hex-string.


       BITAND(string1[,[string2][,padchar]])
              Returns a string which is the bitwise AND of its two first
              parameters.  The shorter string is padded with `padchar'.


       BITOR(string1[,[string2][,padchar]])
              Like `BITAND' but uses logical OR.


       BITXOR(string1[,[string2][,padchar]])
              Like `BITAND' but uses logical XOR.


       C2D(string[,length])
              Converts the character string `string' to a decimal number.
              `Length' specifies the number of characters in `string' to
              convert.


       C2X(string)
              Converts the character string `string' to a hex-string.


       CENTER(string,length[,padchar])

       CENTRE(string,length[,padchar])
              Centers `string' in a string of `length' characters, using
              `padchar' for padding, if necessary.


       CHARIN([streamid][,[start][,length]])
              Read `length' (default is 1) characters from an input stream
              (default is the standard input stream), optionally starting at
              position `start' (default is the current read position).


       CHANGESTR(string1,string,string2)

              `string2'.


       CHAROUT([streamid][,[string][,start]])
              Writes `stream' to an output stream (default is the standard
              output stream), starting at position `start' (default is the
              current write position).


       CHARS([streamid])
              Returns the number of characters left in the input stream
              (default is the standard input stream).


       COMPARE(string1,string2[,padchar])
              Returns `0' or `1', depending on whether the two strings are
              equal.  The shorter string is padded with `padchar', or space if
              padchar is omitted.


       CONDITION([option])
              Performs various operations on streams, see other documentation.

       DELSTR(string,start[,length])
              Deletes the substring of `string' starting at position `start'
