Xless(1)                FreeBSD General Commands Manual               Xless(1)

NAME
       xless - File browsing program for the X Window System.

SYNOPSIS
       xless [-f] [-toolkitoption ...] [filename ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Xless pops up a window on the display specified, containing the file
       specified on the command line or piped in from stdin.  This file may
       easily be viewed using the scrollbar to the left of the window.  Xless
       also takes input from the standard input.  Extra function are available
       on the toolbox to the right of the window:

       - Pop up a help window.

       - Search a specified pattern

       - Search the next occurance of the above specified pattern

       - Open a session of the editor (specified in the environment variable
       EDITOR) on the current file

       - Reload the current file

       - Change file in the current window

       - Open a new xless window to display the specified file

       - Print the current file

       - Close the current window

       For further information on using xless please read the online help
       information.  The rest of this manual page will discuss customization
       of xless to suit the needs of a particular user.

OPTIONS
       Xless is build upon the X Toolkit (Xt) and as such understands all the
       normal command line options (as described in X(1).  It also supports:

       -follow
              Continually check the file for new input (so that xless behaves
              like tail -f).

       -f     Alias for -f.

       -help  Print a list of valid options.  -version Print the version
              number of this xless executable.

WIDGET AND RESOURCE NAMES
       In addition to the usual widget resources, Xless has the following
       application resources:

       standardFont
                 The default font to be used if any of the specified fonts are
                 available.

       textFont  The fonts to use for the text.

       labelFont The fonts to use for labels in dialog boxes.

       buttonFont
                 The fonts to use for labels on buttons.

       standardCur
                 The cursors to use in the main button window with the Quit
                 and Help commands.

       dialogCur The cursors to use in the toolbox and dialog box windows.

       helpFile  Name of a file to use instead of the system default helpfile.

       editor    Name of editor to invoke (if neither VISUAL nor EDITOR
                 environment variable is set)

       editorDoesWindows
                 Set to TRUE if your editor brings up its own window (xedit or
                 GNU emacs, for example.)

       printCommand
                 Command string used to print the current file.  The name of
                 the file is simply appended to this string.  (enscript -G is
                 nice, if you've got it.)

       maxWindows
                 Maximum number of windows which xless will display at one
                 time.  Set this to zero if you don't want a limit.  (This is
                 a good    thing to set if you tend to run xless * in
                 directories with lots of files.)

       quitButton
                 Set to TRUE if you want a Quit button on every window which,
                 when clicked, will quit every window started from this copy
                 of xless.  The default is FALSE.

       sizeToFit Set to TRUE if you want text windows to be only as big as
                 they need to be, up to the maximum size specified by
                 'geometry'.

       removePath
                 Set to TRUE if you want the directory portion of the file
                 path removed.  For example, a path like
                 /usr/src/X11/xless/main.c would be shortened to main.c.  The
                 default is TRUE.

       defaultSearchType
                 Default method used to search the text (invoked from the
                 Search button).  Possible values are ExactMatch (which is the
                 default), CaseInsensitive and RegularExpression.

       monitorFile
                 Set to TRUE if you want the file to be continually checked
                 for new input (so that xless behaves like tail -f).  The
                 default is FALSE.

COLOR RESOURCES
       If you have a color display and you're running at least X11R5, you may
       want to add a line like:


                   #ifdef COLOR
                   *customization: -color
                   #endif

       to your personal resources file.  This will allow you to get the color-
       related resources for not only xless, but for every program which sets
       up its own color resources.

       Versions of X earlier than X11R5 don't support the customization
       resource.  If you're on one of those, you'll have to include the color
       resources in your personal resources file.
