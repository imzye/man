NAME
       2025.08.09 - ldmud

SYNOPSIS
       ldmud [options] [<portnumber>...]

DESCRIPTION
       2025.08.09 11:32:00 Seeding PRNG from /dev/urandom.  LDMud 3.3.720 - a
       LPMud Game Driver.

       Release:  Build 3010 (stable); 2011-02-22 Compiled: Aug  9 2025
       11:31:47

       Options are:

       --args <filename>

              Read the options from <filename> as if they were given on the
              commandline.

       -P|--inherit <fd-number>

              Inherit filedescriptor <fd-number> from the parent process as
              socket to listen for connections.

       -u|--udp <portnumber>

              Specify the <portnumber> for the UDP port, overriding the
              compiled-in default.

       -D|--define <macro>[=<text>]

              Add <macro> (optionally to be expanded to <text>) to the list of
              predefined macros known by the LPC compiler.

       -E|--eval-cost <ticks>

              Set the number of <ticks> available for one evaluation thread.

       -M|--master <filename>

              Use <filename> for the master object.

       -m|--mudlib <pathname>

              Use <pathname> as the top directory of the mudlib.

       --debug-file <filename>

              Log all debug output in <filename> instead of <host>.debug.log .

       --access-file <filename>|none

              Activate access control with these access permissions data.  If
              'none' is given access control is deactivated.

       --access-log <filename>|none

              Log valid and rejected connections into this file.  If 'none' is
              given no log is written.

       --hostname <name>

              Use <name> as hostname, instead of what the system says.

       --hostaddr <addr>

              Use <addr> as address of this machine, instead of what the
              system says. In particular this address will be used to open the
              driver ports.

       --compat

       --no-compat

              Select the mode (compat or plain) of the driver.  Note that this
              choice does not affect the default name of the master object.

       -d|--debug

              Generate debug output; repeat the argument for even more output.

       -c|--list-compiles

              List the name of every compiled file on stderr.

       -e|--no-preload

              Pass a non-zero argument (the number of occurences of this
              option) to master->preload(), which usually inhibits all
              preloads of castles and other objects.

       --erq <filename>

       --erq "<filename> <erq arguments>"

              Use <filename> instead of 'erq' as the name of the ERQ
              executable.  If the name starts with a '/', it is take to be an
              absolute pathname, otherwise it is interpreted relative to
              /usr/local/sbin.  If not specified, 'erq' is used as executable
              name.  With the proper use of quotes it is legal to pass
              arbitrary arguments to the erq, however, these may not contain
              spaces themselves.

       -N|--no-erq

              Don't start the erq demon (if it would be started at all).

       --alarm-time <time>

              The granularity of call_out()s and heartbeats (minimum: 1).

       --heart-interval <time>

              The time to elapse between two heartbeats (minimum: 1).

       --sync-heart

              All heartbeats are executed at the same time (modulo
              granularity).

       --async-heart

              Heartbeats are executed immediately when they are due (modulo
              granularity).

       -t|--no-heart

              Disable heartbeats and call_outs.

       -f|--funcall <word>

              The lfun master->flag() is called with <word> as argument before
              the gamedriver accepts network connections.

       --cleanup-time <time>

              The idle time in seconds for an object before the driver tries
              to clean it up. This time should be substantially higher than
              the reset time. A time <= 0 disables the cleanup mechanism.

       --reset-time <time>

              The time in seconds for an object before it is reset.  A time <=
              0 disables the reset mechanism.

       --regexp pcre|traditional

              Select the default regexp package.

       --max-array <size>

              The maximum number of elements an array can hold.  Set to 0,
              arrays of any size are allowed.

       --max-callouts <number>

              The maximum number of callouts at one time.  Set to 0, any
              number of callouts is allowed.

       --max-mapping <size>

              The maximum number of elements (keys+values) a mapping can hold.
              Set to 0, mappings of any size are allowed.

       --max-mapping-keys <size>

              The maximum number of entries (keys) a mapping can hold.  Set to
              0, mappings of any size are allowed.

       --max-bytes <size>

              The maximum number of bytes one read_bytes()/write_bytes() call
              can handle.  Set to 0, reads and writes of any size are allowed.

       --max-file <size>

              The maximum number of bytes one read_file()/write_file() call
              can handle.  Set to 0, reads and writes of any size are allowed.

       --max-write-buffer <size>

              The maximum number of bytes to be kept pending for each socket
              to write.  Set to 0, an unlimited amount of data can be kept
              pending.

       -s <time>
              | --swap-time <time>

       -s v<time> | --swap-variables <time>

              Time in seconds before an object (or its variables) are swapped
              out.  A time less or equal 0 disables swapping.

       -s f<name> | --swap-file <name>

              Swap into file <name> instead of LP_SWAP.<host> .

       -s c | --swap-compact

              Reuse free space in the swap file immediately.

       --hard-malloc-limit <size>

              Restrict total memory allocation to <size> bytes. A <size> of 0
              or 'unlimited' removes any restriction.

       --soft-malloc-limit <size>

              If total memory allocation exceeds <size> bytes, inform the
              mudlib master about a developing low memory situation. A <size>
              of 0 or 'unlimited' removes the threshold. <size> must be
              smaller than --hard-malloc-limit.

       --min-malloc <size>

       --min-small-malloc <size>

              Determine the sizes for the explicite initial large resp. small
              chunk allocation. A size of 0 disables the explicite initial
              allocations.

       -r u<size> | --reserve-user <size>

       -r m<size> | --reserve-master <size>

       -r s<size> | --reserve-system <size>

              Reserve <size> amount of memory for user/master/system
              allocations to be held until main memory runs out.

       --filename-spaces

       --no-filename-spaces

              Allow/disallow the use of spaces in filenames.

       --strict-euids

       --no-strict-euids

              Enforce/don't enforce the proper use of euids.

       --share-variables

       --init-variables

              Select how clones initialize their variables:

              - by sharing the current values of their blueprint - by
              initializing them afresh (using __INIT()).

       --tls-key <pathname>|none

              Use <pathname> as the x509 keyfile, default is 'key.pem'.  If
              relative, <pathname> is interpreted relative to <mudlib>.  If
              'none' is given TLS is deactivated.

       --tls-cert <pathname>

              Use <pathname> as the x509 certfile, default is 'cert.pem'.  If
              relative, <pathname> is interpreted relative to <mudlib>.

       --tls-trustfile <pathname>|none

              Use <pathname> as the filename holding your trusted PEM
              certificates,

              default is 'none'.

              If relative, <pathname> is interpreted relative to <mudlib>.

       --tls-trustdirectory <pathname>|none

              Use <pathname> as the directory where your trusted PEM
              certificates reside,

              default is 'none'.

              If relative, <pathname> is interpreted relative to <mudlib>.

       --tls-crlfile <pathname>|none

              Use <pathname> as the filename holding your certificate
              revocation lists,

              default is 'none'.

              If relative, <pathname> is interpreted relative to <mudlib>.

       --tls-crldirectory <pathname>|none

              Use <pathname> as the directory where your certificate
              revocation lists reside,

              default is 'none'.

              If relative, <pathname> is interpreted relative to <mudlib>.

       --wizlist-file <filename>

       --no-wizlist-file

              Read and save the wizlist in the named file (always interpreted
              relative the mudlib); resp. don't read or save the wizlist.

       --pidfile <filename>

              Write the pid of the driver process into <filename>.

       --randomdevice <filename>

              Determines the source of the seed for the random number
              generator.  (tries /dev/urandom by default and uses system clock
              as fallback)

       --random-seed <num>

              Seed value for the random number generator. If not given, the
              driver chooses a seed value on its own.

       --gcollect-outfd <filename>|<num>

              Garbage collector output (like a log of all reclaimed memory
              blocks) is sent to <filename> (or inherited fd <num>) instead of
              stderr.

       --check-refcounts

              Every backend cycle, all refcounts in the system are checked.
              SLOW!

       --check-state <lvl>

              Perform a regular simplistic check of the virtual machine
              according to <lvl>:

              = 0: no check = 1: once per backend loop = 2: at various points
              in the backend loop

       --gobble-descriptors <num>

              <num> (more) filedescriptors are used up. You'll know when you
              need it.

       --options

              Print the version and compilation options of the driver, then
              exit.

       -V|--version

              Print the version of the driver, then exit.

       --longhelp

              Display this help and exit.

       -h|-?|--help

              Display the short help text and exit.
