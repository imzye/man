NAME
       bindfs ‐ mount --bind in user-space



SYNOPSIS
       bindfs [options] dir mountpoint



DESCRIPTION
       A FUSE filesystem for mirroring the contents of a directory to another
       directory, with changes to permissions and other features.


FILE OWNERSHIP
       -u, --force-user, -o force-user=...
              Makes all files owned by the specified user.  Also causes chown
              on the mounted filesystem to always fail.


       -g, --force-group=group, -o force-group=...
              Makes all files owned by the specified group.  Also causes chgrp
              on the mounted filesystem to always fail.


       -p, --perms=permissions, -o perms=...
              Takes a comma- or colon-separated list of chmod-like permission
              specifications to be applied to the permission bits in order.
              See PERMISSION SPECIFICATION below for details.

              This only affects how the permission bits of existing files are
              altered when shown in the mounted directory. You can use
              --create-with-perms to change the permissions that newly created
              files get in the source directory.

              Note that, as usual, the root user isn't bound by the
              permissions set here.  You can get a truly read-only mount by
              using -r.


       -m, --mirror=user1:user2:..., -o mirror=...
              Takes a comma- or colon-separated list of users who will see
              themselves as the owners of all files. Users who are not listed
              here will still be able to access the mount if the permissions
              otherwise allow them to.

              You can also give a group name prefixed with an '@' to mirror
              all members of a group. This will not change which group the
              files are shown to have.


       -M, --mirror-only=user1:user2:..., -o mirror-only=...
              Like --mirror but disallows access for all other users (except
              root).


       --map=user1/user2:@group1/@group2:..., -o map=...
              Given a mapping user1/user2, all files owned by user1 are shown
              as owned by user2. When user2 creates files, they are chowned to
              user1 in the underlying directory. When files are chowned to
              user2, they are chowned to user1 in the underlying directory.
              Works similarly for groups.

              A single user or group may appear no more than once on the left
              and once on the right of a slash in the list of mappings.
              Currently, the options --force-user, --force-group, --mirror,
              --create-for-*, --chown-* and --chgrp-* override the
              corresponding behavior of this option.

              Requires mounting as root.


       --map-passwd=<passwdfile>, -o map-passwd=<passwdfile>
       --map-group=<groupfile>, -o map-group=<groupfile>
              Like --map=..., but reads the UID (GID) mapping from passwd
              (group) file (like /etc/passwd and /etc/group). Maps UID (GID)
              provided in the <passwdfile> (<groupfile>) to its corresponding
              user (group) name.  Helpful to restore system backups where UIDs
              and GIDs differ.

              Example usage:

                  bindfs --map-passwd=/mnt/orig/etc/passwd \
                      --map-group=/mnt/orig/etc/group \
                      /mnt/orig /mnt/mapped

              Requires mounting as root.

       --map-passwd-rev=<passwdfile>, -o map-passwd-rev=<passwdfile>
       --map-group-rev=<groupfile>, -o map-group-rev=<groupfile>
              Reversed variant of --map-passwd and --map-group. Like
              --map=..., but reads the UID (GID) mapping from passwd (group)
              files (like /etc/passwd and /etc/group). Maps user (group) name
              provided in the <passwdfile> (<groupfile>) to its corresponding
              UID (GID).  Helpful to create compatible chroot environments
              where UIDs and GIDs differ.

              Example usage:

                  bindfs --map-passwd-rev=/mnt/mapped/etc/passwd \
                      --map-group-rev=/mnt/mapped/etc/group \
                      /mnt/orig /mnt/mapped

              Requires mounting as root.

       --uid-offset=..., -o uid-offset=...
              Works like --map, but adds the given number to all file owner
              user IDs.  For instance, --uid-offset=100000 causes a file owned
              by user 123 to be shown as owned by user 100123.

              For now, this option cannot be used together with --map. Please
              file an issue with the desired semantics if you have a case for
              using them together.

              Requires mounting as root.

       --gid-offset=..., -o gid-offset=...
              Works exactly like --uid-offset but for groups.


FILE CREATION POLICY
       New files and directories are created so they are owned by the mounter.
       bindfs can let this happen (the default for normal users), or it can
       try to change the owner to the uid/gid of the process that wants to
       create the file (the default for root).  It is also possible to have
       bindfs try to change the owner to a particular user or group.

       --create-as-user, -o create-as-user
              Tries to change the owner and group of new files and directories
              to the uid and gid of the caller. This can work only if the
              mounter is root.  It is also the default behavior (mimicking
              mount --bind) if the mounter is root.

       --create-as-mounter, -o create-as-mounter
              All new files and directories will be owned by the mounter.
              This is the default behavior for non-root mounters.

       --create-for-user=user, -o create-for-user=...
              Tries to change the owner of new files and directories to the
              user specified here.  This can work only if the mounter is root.
              This option overrides the --create-as-user and
              --create-as-mounter options.

       --create-for-group=group, -o create-for-group=...
              Tries to change the owning group of new files and directories to
              the group specified here.  This can work only if the mounter is
              root.  This option overrides the --create-as-user and
              --create-as-mounter options.

       --create-with-perms=permissions, -o create-with-perms=...
              Works like --perms but is applied to the permission bits of new
              files get in the source directory.  Normally the permissions of
              new files depend on the creating process's preferences and
              umask.  This option can be used to modify those permissions or
              override them completely.  See PERMISSION SPECIFICATION below
              for details.


CHOWN/CHGRP POLICY
       The behaviour on chown/chgrp calls can be changed. By default they are
       passed through to the source directory even if bindfs is set to show a
       fake owner/group. A chown/chgrp call will only succeed if the user has
       enough mirrored permissions to chmod the mirrored file AND the mounter
       has enough permissions to chmod the real file.

       --chown-normal, -o chown-normal
              Tries to chown the underlying file. This is the default.

       --chown-ignore, -o chown-ignore
              Lets chown succeed (if the user has enough mirrored permissions)
              but actually does nothing. A combined chown/chgrp is effectively
              turned into a chgrp-only request.

       --chown-deny, -o chown-deny
              Makes chown always fail with a 'permission denied' error.  A
              combined chown/chgrp request will fail as well.

       --chgrp-normal, -o chgrp-normal
              Tries to chgrp the underlying file. This is the default.

       --chgrp-ignore, -o chgrp-ignore
              Lets chgrp succeed (if the user has enough mirrored permissions)
              but actually does nothing. A combined chown/chgrp is effectively
              turned into a chown-only request.

       --chgrp-deny, -o chgrp-deny
              Makes chgrp always fail with a 'permission denied' error.  A
              combined chown/chgrp request will fail as well.


CHMOD POLICY
       Chmod calls are forwarded to the source directory by default.  This may
       cause unexpected behaviour if bindfs is altering permission bits.

       --chmod-normal, -o chmod-normal
              Tries to chmod the underlying file. This will succeed if the
              user has the appropriate mirrored permissions to chmod the
              mirrored file AND the mounter has enough permissions to chmod
              the real file.  This is the default (in order to behave like
              mount --bind by default).

       --chmod-ignore, -o chmod-ignore
              Lets chmod succeed (if the user has enough mirrored permissions)
              but actually does nothing.

       --chmod-deny, -o chmod-deny
              Makes chmod always fail with a 'permission denied' error.

       --chmod-filter=permissions, -o chmod-filter=...
              Changes the permission bits of a chmod request before it is
              applied to the original file. Accepts the same permission syntax
              as --perms.  See PERMISSION SPECIFICATION below for details.

       --chmod-allow-x, -o chmod-allow-x
              Allows setting and clearing the executable attribute on files
              (but not directories). When used with --chmod-ignore, chmods
              will only affect execute bits on files and changes to other bits
              are discarded.  With --chmod-deny, all chmods that would change
              any bits except execute bits on files will still fail with a
              'permission denied'.  This option does nothing with
              --chmod-normal.


XATTR POLICY
       Extended attributes are mirrored by default, though not all underlying
       file systems support xattrs.

       --xattr-none, -o xattr-none
              Disable extended attributes altogether. All operations will
              return 'Operation not supported'.

       --xattr-ro, -o xattr-ro
              Let extended attributes be read-only.

       --xattr-rw, -o xattr-rw
              Let extended attributes be read-write (the default).  The
              read/write permissions are checked against the (possibly
              modified) file permissions inside the mount.


OTHER FILE OPERATIONS
       --delete-deny, -o delete-deny
              Makes all file delete operations fail with a 'permission
              denied'.  By default, files can still be modified if they have
              write permission, and renamed if the directory has write
              permission.

       --rename-deny, -o rename-deny
              Makes all file rename/move operations within the mountpoint fail
              with a 'permission denied'. Programs that move files out of a
              mountpoint do so by copying and deleting the original.

RATE LIMITS
       Reads and writes through the mount point can be throttled. Throttling
       works by sleeping the required amount of time on each read or write
       request.  Throttling imposes one global limit on all readers/writers as
       opposed to a per-process or per-user limit.

       Currently, the implementation is not entirely fair. See BUGS below.

       --read-rate=N, -o read-rate=N
              Allow at most N bytes per second to be read. N may have one of
              the following (1024-based) suffixes: k, M, G, T.

       --write-rate=N, -o write-rate=N
              Same as above, but for writes.

LINK HANDLING
       --hide-hard-links, -o hide-hard-links
              Shows the hard link count of all files as 1.

       --resolve-symlinks, -o resolve-symlinks
              Transparently resolves symbolic links.  Disables creation of new
              symbolic links.

              With the following exceptions, operations will operate directly
              on the target file instead of the symlink. Renaming/moving a
              resolved symlink (inside the same mount point) will move the
              symlink instead of the underlying file. Deleting a resolved
              symlink will delete the underlying symlink but not the
              destination file. This can be configured with --resolved-
              symlink-deletion.

              Note that when some programs, such as vim, save files, they
              actually move the old file out of the way, create a new file in
              its place, and finally delete the old file. Doing these
              operations on a resolved symlink will replace it with a regular
              file.

              Symlinks pointing outside the source directory are supported
              with the following exception: accessing the mountpoint
              recursively through a resolved symlink is not supported and will
              return an error. This is because a FUSE filesystem cannot
              reliably call itself recursively without deadlocking, especially
              in single-threaded mode.

       --resolved-symlink-deletion=policy, -o resolved-symlink-deletion=policy
              If --resolve-symlinks is enabled, decides what happens when a
              resolved symlink is deleted.  The options are: deny (resolved
              symlinks cannot be deleted), symlink-only (the underlying
              symlink is deleted, its target is not), symlink-first (the
              symlink is deleted, and if that succeeds, the target is deleted
              but no error is reported if that fails) or target-first (the
              target is deleted first, and the symlink is deleted only if
              deleting the target succeeded).  The default is symlink-only.

              Note that deleting files inside symlinked directories is always
              possible with all settings, including deny, unless something
              else protects those files.


MISCELLANEOUS OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Displays a help message and exits.

       -V, --version
              Displays version information and exits.

              --fuse-version Displays the version of the FUSE library
              interface that was seen at compile-time, as well as the version
              that bindfs currently runs with.

       --no-allow-other, -o no-allow-other
              Does not add -o allow_other to FUSE options.  This causes the
              mount to be accessible only by the current user.

              (The deprecated shorthand -n is also still accepted.)

       --realistic-permissions, -o realistic-permissions
              Hides read/write/execute permissions for a mirrored file when
              the mounter doesn't have read/write/execute access to the
              underlying file.  Useless when mounting as root, since root will
              always have full access.

              (Prior to version 1.10 this option was the default behavior.  I
              felt it violated the principle of least surprise badly enough to
              warrant a small break in backwards-compatibility.)

       --ctime-from-mtime, -o ctime-from-mtime
              Recall that a unix file has three standard timestamps: atime
              (last access i.e. read time), mtime (last content modification
              time) ctime (last content or metadata (inode) change time)

              With this option, the ctime of each file and directory is read
              from its mtime.  In other words, only content modifications (as
              opposed to metadata changes) will be reflected in a mirrored
              file's ctime.  The underlying file's ctime will still be updated
              normally.

       --enable-lock-forwarding, -o enable-lock-forwarding
              Forwards flock and fcntl locking requests to the source
              directory.  This way, locking a file in the bindfs mount will
              also lock the file in the source directory.

              This option must be used with --multithreaded because otherwise
              bindfs will deadlock as soon as there is lock contention.
              However, see BUGS below for caveats about --multithreaded with
              the current implementation.

       --disable-lock-forwarding, -o disable-lock-forwarding
              Currently does nothing, but a future release may default to
              enabling lock forwarding. If you depend on this behaviour, it's
              recommended to set this flag explicitly.

       --enable-ioctl, -o enable-ioctl
              Enables forwarding of ioctl, which is needed for some advanced
              features such as append-only files (chattr +a). Note that the
              ioctl action will be performed as the mounter, not the calling
              user. No efforts are made to check whether the calling user
              would ordinarily have the permissions to make the ioctl. This
              may be a security concern, especially when mounting as root.

       --block-devices-as-files, -o block-devices-as-files
              Shows block devices as regular files.

       --multithreaded, -o multithreaded
              Run bindfs in multithreaded mode. While bindfs is designed to be
              otherwise thread-safe, there is currently a race condition that
              may pose a security risk for some use cases. See BUGS below.

       --direct-io, -o direct-io

              Forwards each read/write operation 1:1 to the underlying FS,
              disabling batching and caching by the kernel. Some applications
              may require this, however it may be incompatible with other
              applications, as currently it has issues with mmap(2) calls, at
              least.

       --no-direct-io, -o no-direct-io

              This option is provided in case the default changes in the
              future.

       --forward-odirect=alignment, -o forward-odirect=alignment
              Enable experimental O_DIRECT forwarding, with all read/write
              requests rounded to the given alignment (in bytes). By default,
              the O_DIRECT flag is not forwarded to the underlying FS.  See
              open(2) for details about O_DIRECT.

              Only works on Linux. Ignored on other platforms.


FUSE OPTIONS
       See fuse(8) for the full list of FUSE options. Some of the more common
       ones are mentioned below.

       -r, -o ro
              Make the mount strictly read-only.  This even prevents root from
              writing to it.  If this is all you need, then (since Linux
              2.6.26) you can get a more efficient mount with mount --bind and
              then mount -o remount,ro.

       -d, -o debug
              Enable debug output (implies -f).

       -o fsname=name
              Sets the source directory name in /proc/mounts (returned by
              mount).  This is automatically set as long as the source path
              has no special characters.

       -f     Foreground operation.


PERMISSION SPECIFICATION
       The -p option takes a comma- or colon-separated list of either octal
       numeric permission bits or symbolic representations of permission bit
       operations.  The symbolic representation is based on that of the
       chmod(1) command.  setuid, setgid and sticky bits are ignored.

       This program extends the chmod symbolic representation with the
       following operands:

       `D' (right hand side)
           Works like X but applies only to directories (not to executables).

       `d' and `f' (left hand side)
           Makes this directive only apply to directories (d) or files (f).
           e.g. gd-w would remove the group write bit from all directories.

       `u', `g', `o' (right hand side)
           Uses the user (u), group (g) or others (o) permission bits of
           the original file.
           e.g. g=u would copy the user's permission bits to the group.
                ug+o would add the others' permissions to the owner and group.


       Examples
       o-rwx  Removes all permission bits from others.

       g=rD   Allows group to read all files and enter all directories, but
              nothing else.

       0644,a+X
              Sets permission bits to 0644 and adds the execute bit for
              everyone to all directories and executables.

       og-x:og+rD:u=rwX:g+rw
              Removes execute bit for others and group, adds read and
              directory execute for others and group, sets user permissions to
              read, write and execute directory/executable, adds read and
              write for group.


EXAMPLES
       bindfs -u www -g nogroup -p 0000,u=rD ~/mywebsite ~/public_html/mysite

              Publishes a website in public_html so that only the 'www' user
              can read the site.

       bindfs -M foo,bar,1007,@mygroup -p 0600,u+X dir mnt

              Gives access to 'foo', 'bar', the user with the UID 1007 as well
              as everyone in the group 'mygroup'. Sets the permission bits to
              0600, thus giving the specified users read/write access, and
              adds the user execute bit for directories and executables.

       bindfs -ono-allow-other,perms=a-w somedir somedir

              Makes a directory read-only and accessible only by the current
              user.

       /home/bob/shared /var/www/shared/bob fuse.bindfs perms=0000:u+rD 0 0

              An example /etc/fstab entry. Note that the colon must be used to
              separate arguments to perms, because the comma is an option
              separator in /etc/fstab.

       bindfs#/home/bob/shared /var/www/shared/bob fuse perms=0000:u+rD 0 0

              Older systems may require this deprecated fstab syntax.


NOTES
       Setuid and setgid bits have no effect inside the mount.  This is a
       necessary security feature of FUSE.

       Access to device files is denied by default by FUSE as a security
       precaution.  Use -o dev to enable access (requires mounting as root).
       This may not be supported on all operating systems.

       MacFuse caches file contents by default.  This means that changes in
       source files are not always immediately visible under the mount point.
       -o nolocalcaches can be used to disable the cache.

       When using --mirror[-only] @somegroup, bindfs won't see changes to the
       group's member list.  Sending bindfs a SIGUSR1 signal will make it
       reread the user database.

       The following extra options may be useful under osxfuse: -o
       local,allow_other,extended_security,noappledouble See
       https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/wiki/Mount-options for details.

BUGS
       If bindfs is run in multithreaded mode (with the --multithreaded
       option) then it's possible for another process to briefly see a file
       with an incorrect owner, group or permissions.  This may constitute a
       security risk if you rely on bindfs to reduce permissions on new files.
       For this reason, as of version 1.11 bindfs runs in single-threaded mode
       by default.

       Rate limiting favors the process with the larger block size.  If two
       processes compete for read/write access, the one whose read()/write()
       calls specify the larger block size gets to read/write faster.  The
       total rate limit is maintained though, and clients with equal block
       sizes and a similar rate of requests are treated fairly as long as the
       kernel orders their requests fairly.

       Some features relying on xattrs might not work properly on OS X
       (https://github.com/mpartel/bindfs/issues/21).  For instance, Finder
       tags seem to work but comments might not.

DEPRECATIONS
       The option names --user and --group were deprecated and replaced with
       --force-user and --force-group in version 1.12.  The former names
       clashed with standard option names.  They are still available but their
       use is discouraged and prints a warning. The synonym --owner is also
       deprecated for consistency.
