XML::Compile::SOAP::WSA(3)                 User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       XML::Compile::SOAP::WSA - SOAP Web Service Addressing

INHERITANCE
        XML::Compile::SOAP::WSA
          is a XML::Compile::SOAP::Extension

SYNOPSIS
        # load the module
        use XML::Compile::SOAP::WSA;
        my $wsa  = XML::Compile::SOAP::WSA->new(version => '1.0');

        # you may need some constants (rarely)
        use XML::Compile::SOAP::WSA::Util ':wsa10';

        # use WSA via WSDL
        my $wsdl = XML::Compile::WSDL11->new(...);
        my $call = $wsdl->compileClient('some_operation');

        # wsa header fields start with wsa_
        my ($data, $trace) = $call->(wsa_MessageID => 'xyz', %data);

        print $wsdl->operation('myop')->wsaAction;

DESCRIPTION
       The Web Service Addressing protocol is used to select certain service
       and port on a SOAP server, just like the "Host" header in "HTTP".

       The basic SOAP design uses the URI and the "soapAction" header of HTTP
       (in case it uses HTTP, by far the most often used transport mechanism)
       However, when the server is hidden behind firewalls and proxies, these
       fields are rewritten or replaced.  This means that the definitions by
       the WSDL for the client can differ from the configuration of the
       server.  This is where WSA comes into play.

       When WSA is enabled, header fields are added. Automatically, the
       obligatory "wsa_To" and "wsa_Action" fields will be added to each
       request, although you may change their values with call parameters.

       Warning: this being a very recent module, thing may not work. There is
       no real-life experience with the code, as yet. Please contact the
       author when you are succesful or discovered problems.

METHODS
   Constructors
       XML::Compile::SOAP::WSA->new(OPTIONS)

        Option --Default
        version  <required>

           . version => '0.9'|'1.0'|MODULE

               Explicitly state which version WSA needs to be produced.  You
               may use a version number (where 0.9 is used to represent the
               "submission" specification). You may also use the MODULE name,
               which is a namespace constant, provided via "::Util".  The only
               option is currently "WSL10MODULE".
