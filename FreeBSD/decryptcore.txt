DECRYPTCORE(8)          FreeBSD System Manager's Manual         DECRYPTCORE(8)

NAME
     decryptcore – decrypt a core dump of the operating system

SYNOPSIS
     decryptcore [-fLv] -p privatekeyfile -k keyfile -e encryptedcore -c core
     decryptcore [-fLv] [-d crashdir] -p privatekeyfile -n dumpnr

DESCRIPTION
     The decryptcore utility first decrypts keyfile using privatekeyfile and
     then uses the resulting key to decrypt encryptedcore saved by
     savecore(8).  The result is saved in core.

     Alternatively a user can decrypt a core dump numbered dumpnr from the
     crashdir directory.  In this case a dump key from the key.# file is used
     and the result is saved in the vmcore.# file where “#” corresponds to
     dumpnr.

     By default decryptcore does not overwrite an old core dump as a user
     might want to store the core somewhere else for the future.  This
     behaviour can be changed using the -f flag.

     The decryptcore utility can be started with the following command line
     arguments:

     -f                      Remove a decryped core dump if it already exists.

     -L                      Write log messages to syslogd(8).

     -v                      Print or log verbose/debugging information.  This
                             option can be specified multiple times to raise
                             the verbosity level.

     -p privatekeyfile       Specify location of a private key file which will
                             be used to decrypt a dump key file.

     -k keyfile              Specify location of a dump key file.

     -e encryptedcore        Specify location of an encrypted core.

     -c core                 Specify location of a resulting decrypted core
                             dump.

     -d crashdir             Specify an alternative crash dump directory.  The
                             default crash dump directory is /var/crash.

     -n dumpnr               Specify a number of a crash dump to be decrypted.

EXIT STATUS
     The decryptcore utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
