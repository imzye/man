IPFIXCOL2-ANONYMIZATION-INTER(7)                            IPFIXcol collector

NAME
       ipfixcol2-anonymization-inter - Anonymization (intermediate plugin)

DESCRIPTION
       The plugin performs IPv4/IPv6 address anonymization of all flow
       records. There are two available methods that could be applied on IP
       addresses, CryptoPAN and address truncation.

       To identify IPFIX fields of a record to modify, the plugin uses a type
       of an Information Element linked to each field. Thus, any record field
       with known corresponding Information Element and type is always
       automatically anonymized.  Enterprise-specific Information Elements are
       supported too.

EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION

          <intermediate>
              <name>Flow anonymization</name>
              <plugin>anonymization</plugin>
              <params>
                  <type>CryptoPAn</type>
                  <key>0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuv</key>
              </params>
          </intermediate>

PARAMETERS

       type   Type of anonymization method. The string is case insensitive.

              CryptoPAn
                     Cryptography-based sanitization and prefix-preserving
                     method. The mapping from original IP addresses to
                     anonymized IP addresses is one-to-one and if two original
                     IP addresses share a k-bit prefix, their anonymized
                     mappings will also share a k-bit prefix.  Be aware that
                     this cryptography method is very demanding and can limit
                     throughput of the collector.

              Truncation
                     This method keeps the top part and erases the bottom part
                     of an IP address. Compared to the CryptoPAn method, it is
                     considerably faster, however, mapping from the original
                     to anonymized IP address is many-to-one. For example the
                     IPv4 address "1.2.3.4" is mapped to the address
                     "1.2.0.0".

       key    Optional cryptography key for CryptoPAn anonymization. The
              length of the string must be exactly 32 bytes. If the key is not
              specified, a random one is generated during the initialization.

NOTES
       Usually all common IP addresses are automatically anonymized. However,
       if an IPFIX field is not, make sure that the particular Information
       Element is defined among other definitions provided by libfds
       <https://github.com/CESNET/libfds/>
        library.  Mainly in case of Enterprise-Specific Information Elements,
       there is a chance that the definitions are missing. See the
       documentation of the library, for help to easily add extra definitions
       in few steps.
