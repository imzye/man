NAME
       podsection -- select sections from Module's POD

SYNOPSIS
        podsection [-h] [-u] ModuleName SectionName [SectionName ...]

       For example:

        podsection Catalyst SYNOPSIS   # as text
        podsection Catalyst req res    # as text
        podsection -u Catalyst req res # as plain pod

       Don't work with Some module:

        podsection CGI header # doesn't work correctly

       Don't work with mixed level section:

        podsection Catalyst SYNOPSIS res  # only show one(in this case, show only SYNOPSIS)

       Because Pod::Section only searches name in one level.  If in one level,
       one/some of them is/are found, it finishes to search.

OPTIONS
       -u  Display POD as plain POD.

       -h  Show this usage.

       The way to search section is poor. This cannot find section correctory
       in some module.
