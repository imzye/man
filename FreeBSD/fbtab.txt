NAME
     fbtab – change device protection upon login

DESCRIPTION
     The fbtab file contains a number of lines specifying a device together
     with a list of devices with associated protections.  Comments start with
     a ‘#’ and extend to the end of the line.

     Blank lines or lines with only a comment are ignored.

     All other lines consist of three fields delimited by whitespace: a login
     device (/dev/ttyv0), an octal permission number (0600), and a colon (‘:’)
     delimited list of device patterns (/dev/console, /dev/dsp*).  All device
     patterns are absolute paths.

     If the tty argument (relative path) matches a login device name (absolute
     path), the permissions of the devices in the colon-delimited list are set
     as specified in the second field, and their ownership is changed to that
     of the UID and GID arguments.

FILES
     /etc/fbtab      The fbtab file resides in /etc.
