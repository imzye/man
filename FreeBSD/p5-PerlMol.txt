NAME
       PerlMol - Perl modules for molecular chemistry

SYNOPSIS
           # This is a bundle containing all of the modules
           # of the PerlMol Project and their dependencies.
           # This is not a real module; it is the main index
           # to the documentation of the PerlMol modules.

DESCRIPTION
       PerlMol is a collection of Perl modules for chemoinformatics and
       computational chemistry with the philosophy that "simple things should
       be simple". It should be possible to write one-liners that use this
       toolkit to do meaningful "molecular munging". The PerlMol toolkit
       provides objects and methods for representing molecules, atoms, and
       bonds in Perl; doing substructure matching; and reading and writing
       files in various formats.

DOCUMENTATION
       What follows is an index of the relevant documentation.

   Tutorial
       Chemistry::Tutorial - A good place to start reading the documentation.

   Object oriented modules
       The following modules are indented according to the class hierarchy:

       Chemistry::Obj
           Chemistry::Mol
               Chemistry::Pattern
                   Chemistry::FormulaPattern
                   Chemistry::MidasPattern
               Chemistry::Domain
               Chemistry::MacroMol
               Chemistry::Ring
           Chemistry::Atom
               Chemistry::Pattern::Atom

           Chemistry::File::VRML
           Chemistry::File::XYZ
       Chemistry::InternalCoords
       Chemistry::Mok

   Procedural modules
       These are auxiliary modules for which object classes seemed overkill

       Chemistry::3DBuilder
       Chemistry::Bond::Find
       Chemistry::InternalCoords::Builder
       Chemistry::Ring::Find
       Chemistry::Canonicalize

   Programs (scripts)

EXAMPLES
       The "examples" directory in the PerlMol distribution file has several
       sample scripts with lots of comments and a few input and output files
       that show how one can use PerlMol for common tasks. They can also be
       browsed online at <http://www.perlmol.org/examples/>. Some of the
       examples are:

           * combinatorial_enumeration
           * file_conversion
           * molgrep
           * pdb_viewer
           * peptide_builder
           * polar_surface_area

       extra digits that distinguish between different bundles based on the
       same Chemistry-Mol distribution.
