NAME
       Regexp::Compare - partial ordering for regular expressions

SYNOPSIS
         use Regexp::Compare qw(is_less_or_equal);

         if (is_less_or_equal($rx[i], $rx[j])) {
             print "duplicate: $rx[i]\n";
         }

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements a function comparing regular expressions: it
       returns true if all strings matched by the first regexp are also
       matched by the second. It's meant to be used for optimization of
       blacklists implemented by regular expressions (like, for example,
       "http://www.communitywiki.org/cw/BannedContent" ).

       Both arguments of "is_less_or_equal" are strings - IOW the call

         $rv = is_less_or_equal($rx, /hardcoded/i);

       probably won't do what you want - use

         $rv = is_less_or_equal($rx, '(?i:hardcoded)');

       instead.

       False return value does not imply that there's a string matched by the
       first regexp which isn't matched by the second - many regular
       expressions (i.e. those containing Perl code) are impossible to
       compare, and this module doesn't even implement all possible
       comparisons.

BUGS
       •   EBCDIC-based platforms not supported

       •   comparison of character classes is simplified and probably has some
           incorrect corner cases

       •   comparison fails for locale-specific constructs

       •   comparison fails for regexps with backreferences

       •   global variables affecting regexp matching are ignored

       •   function may die for unusual (legal but unexpected) regexp
           constructs
