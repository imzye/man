NAME
       HAProxy - fast and reliable http reverse proxy and load balancer


SYNOPSIS
       haproxy -f <configuration file|dir> [-L <name>] [-n maxconn]
       [-N maxconn] [-C <dir>] [-v|-vv] [-d] [-D] [-W] [-Ws] [-q] [-V] [-c]
       [-p <pidfile>] [-dk] [-ds] [-de] [-dp] [-db] [-dM[<byte>]] [-m <megs>]
       [-x <unix_socket>] [{-sf|-st} pidlist...]


DESCRIPTION
       HAProxy is a TCP/HTTP reverse proxy which is particularly suited for
       high availability environments. Indeed, it can:
        - route HTTP requests depending on statically assigned cookies ;
        - spread the load among several servers while assuring server
          persistence through the use of HTTP cookies ;
        - switch to backup servers in the event a main one fails ;
        - accept connections to special ports dedicated to service
          monitoring ;
        - stop accepting connections without breaking existing ones ;
        - add/modify/delete HTTP headers both ways ;
        - block requests matching a particular pattern ;
        - hold clients to the right application server depending on
          application cookies
        - report detailed status as HTML pages to authenticated users from an
          URI intercepted from the application.

       It needs very little resource. Its event-driven architecture allows it
       to easily handle thousands of simultaneous connections on hundreds of
       instances without risking the system's stability.


OPTIONS
       -f <configuration file|dir>
              Specify configuration file or directory path. If the argument is
              a directory the files (and only files) it contains are added in
              lexical order (using LC_COLLATE=C) ; only non hidden files with
              ".cfg" extension are added.


       -L <name>
              Set the local instance's peer name. Peers are defined in the
              peers configuration section and used for syncing stick tables
              between different instances. If this option is not specified,
              the local hostname is used as peer name. This name is exported
              in the $HAPROXY_LOCALPEER environment variable and can be used
              in the configuration file.


       -n <maxconn>
              Set the high limit for the total number of simultaneous
              connections.


       -N <maxconn>
              Set the high limit for the per-listener number of simultaneous
              connections.


       -C <dir>
              Change directory to <dir> before loading any files.


       -v     Display HAProxy's version.


       -vv    Display HAProxy's version and all build options.


       -d     Start in foreground with debugging mode enabled.  When the proxy
              runs in this mode, it dumps every connections, disconnections,
              timestamps, and HTTP headers to stdout. This should NEVER be
              used in an init script since it will prevent the system from
              starting up.


       -D     Start in daemon mode.


       -W     Start in master-worker mode. Could be used either with
              foreground or daemon mode.


       -Ws    Start in master-worker mode with systemd notify support. It
              tells systemd when the process is ready. This mode forces
              foreground.


       -q     Disable messages on output.


       -V     Displays messages on output even when -q or 'quiet' are
              specified. Some information about pollers and config file are
              displayed during startup.


       -c     Only checks config file and exits with code 0 if no error was
              found, or exits with code 1 if a syntax error was found.


       -p <pidfile>
              Ask the process to write down each of its children's pids to
              this file in daemon mode or ask the process to write down its
              master's pid to this file in master-worker mode.


       -dk    Disable use of kqueue(2). kqueue(2) is available only on BSD
              systems.


       -dv    Disable use of event ports. Event ports are available only on
              SunOS systems derived from Solaris 10 and later (including
              illumos systems).


       -ds    Disable use of speculative epoll(7). epoll(7) is available only
              on Linux 2.6 and some custom Linux 2.4 systems.


       -de    Disable use of epoll(7). epoll(7) is available only on Linux 2.6
              and some custom Linux 2.4 systems.


       -dp    Disables use of poll(2). select(2) might be used instead.


       -dS    Disables use of splice(2), which is broken on older kernels.


       -db    Disables background mode (stays in foreground, useful for
              debugging).  For debugging, the '-db' option is very useful as
              it temporarily disables daemon mode and multi-process mode. The
              service can then be stopped by simply pressing Ctrl-C, without
              having to edit the config nor run full debug.


       -dM[<byte>]
              Initializes all allocated memory areas with the given <byte>.
              This makes it easier to detect bugs resulting from uninitialized
              memory accesses, at the expense of touching all allocated memory
              once. If <byte> is not specified, it defaults to 0x50 (ASCII
              'P').


       -m <megs>
              Enforce a memory usage limit to a maximum of <megs> megabytes.


       -sf <pidlist>
              Send FINISH signal to the pids in pidlist after startup. The
              processes which receive this signal will wait for all sessions
              to finish before exiting. This option must be specified last,
              followed by any number of PIDs. Technically speaking, SIGTTOU
              and SIGUSR1 are sent.


       -st <pidlist>
              Send TERMINATE signal to the pids in pidlist after startup. The
              processes which receive this signal will terminate immediately,
              closing all active sessions. This option must be specified last,
              followed by any number of PIDs. Technically speaking, SIGTTOU
              and SIGTERM are sent.


       -x <unix_socket>
              Attempt to connect to the unix socket, and retrieve all the
              listening sockets from the old process. Those sockets will then
              be used if possible instead of binding new ones.


       -S <bind>[,<bind options>...]
              In master-worker mode, create a master CLI. This CLI will enable
              access to the CLI of every worker. Useful for debugging, it's a
              convenient way of accessing a leaving process.


LOGGING
       Since HAProxy can run inside a chroot, it cannot reliably access
       /dev/log.  For this reason, it uses the UDP protocol to send its logs
       to the server, even if it is the local server. People who experience
       trouble receiving logs should ensure that their syslog daemon listens
       to the UDP socket.  Several Linux distributions which ship with syslogd
       from the sysklogd package have UDP disabled by default. The -r option
       must be passed to the daemon in order to enable UDP.


SIGNALS
       Some signals have a special meaning for the haproxy daemon. Generally,
       they are used between daemons and need not be used by the
       administrator.

       - SIGUSR1
              Tells the daemon to stop all proxies and exit once all sessions
              are closed. It is often referred to as the "soft-stop" signal.

       - SIGUSR2
              In master-worker mode, reloads the configuration and sends a
              soft-stop signal to old processes.

       - SIGTTOU
              Tells the daemon to stop listening to all sockets. Used
              internally by -sf and -st.

       - SIGTTIN
              Tells the daemon to restart listening to all sockets after a
              SIGTTOU. Used internally when there was a problem during hot
              reconfiguration.

       - SIGINT and SIGTERM
              Both signals can be used to quickly stop the daemon.

       - SIGHUP
              Dumps the status of all proxies and servers into the logs.
              Mostly used for trouble-shooting purposes.

       - SIGQUIT
              Dumps information about memory pools on stderr. Mostly used for
              debugging purposes.

       - SIGPIPE
              This signal is intercepted and ignored on systems without
              MSG_NOSIGNAL.
