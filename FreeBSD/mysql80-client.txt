COMP_ERR(1)                  MySQL Database System                 COMP_ERR(1)



NAME
       comp_err - compile MySQL error message file

SYNOPSIS
       comp_err [options]

DESCRIPTION
       comp_err creates the errmsg.sys file that is used by mysqld to
       determine the error messages to display for different error codes.
       comp_err normally is run automatically when MySQL is built. It compiles
       the errmsg.sys file from text-format error information in MySQL source
       distributions:

       •   As of MySQL 8.0.19, the error information comes from the
           messages_to_error_log.txt and messages_to_clients.txt files in the
           share directory.

           For more information about defining error messages, see the
           comments within those files, along with the errmsg_readme.txt file.

       •   Prior to MySQL 8.0.19, the error information comes from the
           errmsg-utf8.txt file in the sql/share directory.

       comp_err also generates the mysqld_error.h, mysqld_ername.h, and
       mysqld_errmsg.h header files.

       Invoke comp_err like this:

           comp_err [options]

       comp_err supports the following options.

       •   --help, -? Display a help message and exit.

       •   --charset=dir_name, -C dir_name The character set directory. The
           default is ../sql/share/charsets.

       •   --debug=debug_options, -# debug_options Write a debugging log. A
           typical debug_options string is d:t:O,file_name. The default is
           d:t:O,/tmp/comp_err.trace.

       •   --debug-info, -T Print some debugging information when the program
           exits.

       •   --errmsg-file=file_name, -H file_name The name of the error message
           file. The default is mysqld_errmsg.h. This option was added in
           MySQL 8.0.18.

       •   --header-file=file_name, -H file_name The name of the error header
           file. The default is mysqld_error.h.

       •   --in-file=file_name, -F file_name The name of the input file. The
           default is ../share/errmsg-utf8.txt.

           This option was removed in MySQL 8.0.19 and replaced by the
           --in-file-errlog and --in-file-toclient options.

       •   --in-file-errlog=file_name, -e file_name The name of the input file
           that defines error messages intended to be written to the error
           log. The default is ../share/messages_to_error_log.txt.

           This option was added in MySQL 8.0.19.

       •   --in-file-toclient=file_name, -c file_name The name of the input
           file that defines error messages intended to be written to clients.
           The default is ../share/messages_to_clients.txt.

           This option was added in MySQL 8.0.19.

       •   --name-file=file_name, -N file_name The name of the error name
           file. The default is mysqld_ername.h.

       •   --out-dir=dir_name, -D dir_name The name of the output base
           directory. The default is ../sql/share/.

       •   --out-file=file_name, -O file_name The name of the output file. The
           default is errmsg.sys.

       •   --version, -V Display version information and exit.
