NAME
       Math::Series - Perl extension dealing with mathematic series

SYNOPSIS
         use Math::Series;
         my $x_n = Math::Series->new( formula       => 'n*x',
                                      start_value   => 1,
                                      iteration_var => 'n',
                                      previous_var  => 'x',
                                      start_index   => 0,
                                      cached        => 1      );

         print $x_n->next(), "\n" foreach 0..5;
         # prints 1, 2, 6, 24...

         print $x_n->at_index(3);
         # prints 24

DESCRIPTION
       Math::Series defines a class for simple mathematic series with a
       recursive definition such as "x_(n+1) = 1 / (x_n + 1)". Such a
       recursive definition is treated as a sequence whose elements will be
       added to form a series. You can refer to the previous sequence element
       as well as to the current index in the series. Creation of a
       Math::Series object is described below in the paragraph about the
       constructor.

       Math::Series uses Math::Symbolic to parse and modify the recursive
       sequence definitions. That means you specify the sequence as a string
       which is parsed by Math::Symbolic. Alternatively, you can pass the
       constructor a Math::Symbolic tree directly.

       Because Math::Series uses Math::Symbolic for its implementation, all
       results will be Math::Symbolic objects which may contain other
       variables than the sequence variable and the iterator variable.

       Each Math::Series object is an iterator to iterate over the elements of
       the series starting at the first element (which was specified by the
       starting element, the second argument to the new() constructor). It
       offers facilities to cache all calculated elements and access any
       element directly, though unless the element has been cached in a
       previous calculation, this is just a shortcut for repeated use of the
       iterator.

       Every element in the series may only access its predecessor, not the
       elements before that.

   CLASS DATA
       Math::Series defines the following package variables:

       $Math::Series::Parser
         This scalar contains a Parse::RecDescent parser to parse formulas.
         It is derived from the Math::Symbolic::Parser grammar.

       $Math::Series::warnings
         This scalar indicates whether Math::Series should warn about the
         performance implications of using the back() method on uncached
         series. It defaults to true.

   METHODS
       new()
         The constructor for Math::Series objects. It takes named parameters.
         The following parameters are required:

         formula
           The formula is the recursive definition of a sequence whose
           elements up to the current element will be summed to form the
           current element of the series.  The formula may contain various
           Math::Symbolic variables that are assigned a value elsewhere in
           your code, but it may also contain two special variables: The
           number of the current iteration step, starting with 0, and the
           previous element of the series.

           The formula may be specified as a string that can be parsed by a
           Math::Symbolic parser or as a Math::Symbolic tree directly. Please
           refer to the Math::Symbolic and Math::Symbolic::Parser man pages
           for details.

         start_value
           This parameter defines the starting value for the series. It used
           as the element in the series that is defined as the lowest series
           element by the start_index parameter.  The starting value may be a
           string that can be parsed as a valid Math::Symbolic tree or a
           preconstructed Math::Symbolic tree.

         The following parameters are optional:

         iteration_var
           The iteration variable is the name of the variable in the
           Math::Symbolic tree that refers to the current iteration step. It
           defaults to the variable 'n'.

           It must be a valid Math::Symbolic variable identifier. (That means
           it is "/[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*/".)

         previous_var
           The previous_var parameter sets the name of the variable that
           represents the previous iteration step. It defaults to the name 'x'
           and must be a valid Math::Symbolic variable identifier just like
           the iteration variable.

         cached
           This parameter indicates whether or not to cache the calculated
           series' elements for faster direct access. It defaults to true. At
           run-time, the caching behaviour may be altered using the cached()
           method.

         start_index
           The lower boundary for the series' summation. It defaults to 0, but
           may be set to any positive integer or zero.

       next()
         The next() method returns the next element of the series and advances
         the iterator by one. This is the prefered method of walking down a
         series' recursion.

       cached()
         Returns a true value if the series is currently being cached, false
         if it isn't. By default, new objects have caching enabled. It is
         suggested that you only disable caching if space is an issue and you
         will only walk the series uni-directionally and only once.

         cached() can be used to change the caching behaviour. If the first
         argument is true, caching will be enabled. If it is false, caching
         will be disabled.

       current_index()
         Returns the index of the current element. That is, the index of the
         element that will be returned by the next call to the next() method.

         This method also allows (re-)setting the element that will be next
         returned by the next() method. In that case, the first argument
         shoudl be the appropriate index.

         Returns undef and doesn't set the current index if the argument is
         below 0.

       at_index()
         This method returns the series element with the index denoted by the
         first argument to the method. It does not change the state of the
         iterator.  This method is extremely slow for uncached series.

         Returns undef for indices below the starting index.

       back()
         This methods returns the series element previously returned by the
         next() method. Since it is extremely slow on uncached series, it
         warns about this performance hit by default. To turn this warning
         off, set the $Math::Series::warnings scalar to a false value.

         This method decrements the current iterator series element.

         Returns undef if the current index goes below the starting index.
