              megatools copy [-n] [--no-progress] --download --local <path> --remote <remotepath>

DESCRIPTION
       Sync remote and local directories. No files are ever overwritten or
       removed.

       Default direction is to upload files to the cloud. If you want to
       download files, you have to add --download option.

OPTIONS
       -r <remotepath> , --remote <remotepath>
              Remote directory path.

       -l <path> , --local <path>
              Local directory path.

       -d , --download
              Download files from the Mega.nz. The default is to upload.

       -n , --dryrun
              Don’t perform any actual changes, just print what would be done.

       --no-progress
              Disable upload progress reporting.

       --enable-previews
              Generate and upload file previews, when uploading new files.
              This is the default, unless you changed it in the configuration
              file. Use this to override the option from the configuration
              file.

       --disable-previews
              Don’t generate and upload file previews. Default is to generate
              previews.

       --disable-resume
              Don’t resume downloads from partially downloaded file. Default
              is to resume.

              Account username (email)

       -p <password> , --password <password>
              Account password

       --no-ask-password
              Never ask interactively for a password

       --reload

       --limit-speed <speed>
              Set maximum allowed upload and download speed in KiB/s.  This
              option overrides config file settings. 0 means no limit.  When
              using ParallelTransfers > 1, upload speed limit is applied to
              each transfer individually.

       --proxy <proxy>
              Use proxy server to connect to mega.nz. This option overrides
              config file settings.  More information can be found in libcurl
              documentation at
              ⟨https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PROXY.html⟩.  Some
              acceptable values are:

              • none : Disable proxy if it was enabled in the config file.

              • socks5://localhost:9050 : Local SOCKSv5 proxy server

              • socks5h://localhost:9050 : Local SOCKSv5 proxy server with DNS
                handled by the proxy

       --netif <ifname|ip>
              Network interface or local IP address used for outgoing
              connections.  You have to specify IP address bound to some of
              your local network interfaces, when specifying an IP address.

       --ip-proto <proto>
              Which IP protocol to prefer when connecting to mega.nz (v4, v6,
              or any).  This is just an advisory option.  Megatools will
              resolve mega.nz domain, and then use an A or AAAA record based
              on the stated preference.

       --config <path>
              Load configuration from a file

       --ignore-config-file
              Disable loading .megarc

       --debug [<options>]
              Enable debugging of various aspects of the megatools operation.
              You may enable multiple debugging options separated by commas.
              (eg. --debug api,fs)

              Available options are:

              • http: Dump HTTP request/response details (can be used to debug
                connection/proxy issues)

              • api: Dump Mega.nz API calls

              • fs: Dump Mega.nz filesystem (may require --reload to actually
                print something)

              • cache: Dump cache contents

              • tman: Dump transfer manager events

       --version
              Show version information

EXAMPLES
       • Upload directory.

         $ megatools copy --local MyBackups --remote /Root/Backups

       • Download directory.

         $ megatools copy --local MyBackups --remote /Root/Backups --download

REMOTE FILESYSTEM
       Mega.nz filesystem is represented as a tree of nodes of various types.
       Nodes are identified by a 8 character node handles (eg. 7Fdi3ZjC).
       Structure of the filesystem is not encrypted.

       Megatools maps node tree structure to a traditional filesystem paths
       (eg.  /Root/SomeFile.DAT).

       NOTE: By the nature of Mega.nz storage, several files in the directory
       can have the same name. To allow access to such files, the names of
       conflicting files are extended by appending dot and their node handle
       like this:

       /Root/conflictingfile
       /Root/conflictingfile.7Fdi3ZjC
       /Root/conflictingfile.mEU23aSD

       You need to be aware of several special folders:

       /Root  Writable directory representing the root of the filesystem.

       /Trash Trash directory where Mega.nz web client moves deleted files.
              This directory is not used by megatools when removing files.

       /Inbox Not sure.

       /Contacts
              Directory containing subdirectories representing your contacts
              list. If you want to add contacts to the list, simply create
              subdirectory named after the contact you want to add.

       /Contacts/<email>
              Directories representing individual contacts in your contacts
              list. These directories contain folders that others shared with
              you. All shared files are read-only, at the moment.
