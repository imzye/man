HYPER-V(4)             FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual             HYPER-V(4)

NAME
     hv_netvsc – Hyper-V Network Virtual Service Consumer

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in the
     system kernel configuration file:

           device hyperv

DESCRIPTION
     The hv_netvsc driver implements the virtual network device for FreeBSD
     guest partitions running on Hyper-V.  FreeBSD guest partitions running on
     Hyper-V do not have direct access to network devices attached to the
     Hyper-V server.  Although a FreeBSD guest can access network devices
     using Hyper-V's full emulation mode, the performance in this mode tends
     to be unsatisfactory.

     To counter the above issues, the hv_netvsc driver implements a network
     Virtual Service Consumer (VSC) that relays network requests from the
     guest partition to the network Virtual Service Provider (VSP) hosted in
     the root partition using the high performance data exchange
     infrastructure provided by hv_vmbus(4) driver.  The VSP in the root
     partition then forwards the network related requests to the physical
     network card.

HISTORY
     Support for hv_netvsc first appeared in FreeBSD 10.0.  The driver was
     developed through a joint effort between Citrix Incorporated, Microsoft
     Corporation, and Network Appliance Incorporated.

AUTHORS
     FreeBSD support for hv_netvsc was first added by Microsoft BSD
     Integration Services Team <bsdic@microsoft.com>.
