NAME
       caesarcipher - Caesar cipher cryptography tool

SYNOPSIS
       caesarcipher [-d|-e] [-p] [-s shiftvalue] [-i inputfile] [-o
       outputfile] [message ...]

DESCRIPTION
       caesarcipher is an implementation of the Caesar cipher encryption
       algorithm extended to the entire set of printable ASCII characters.

       Program Invocation: caesarcipher can be invoked in the following three
       forms:

       1st Form: If invoked with no arguments, other than a possible
       shiftvalue -s or the -p option, the user is placed into a shell like
       command line enviroment, in which he can enter messages to be encrypted
       or decrypted.

       The "caesarcipher shell" which identifies itself by: cc> understands
       the following commands:

            ascii - print the ASCII table.

            decrypt - enter a message to decrypt.

            encrypt - enter a message to encrypt.

            exit - exit caesarcipher.

            help - print the command menu.

            shifttable - print the current shift table.

            shiftvalue - set a new shiftvalue.

            spaces - turn preserve spaces on/off.

            quit - quit caesarcipher (same as exit).

       2nd Form: In this form, the utility is invoked with either the -d or -e
       switch, a given shift value -s to encrypt or decrypt messages passed
       via the command line.

       3rd Form: If the message to be processed is inside a file, then
       caesarcipher can, alongside the -d or -e switches, be invoked with the
       -i  option, which takes an associated inputfile argument. If -o
       outputfile is specified as well, then the encoded/decoded message is
       written to the outputfile. Otherwise the message is written to stdout.

OPTIONS
       -d, --decrypt
              decrypt the message or inputfile

       -e, --encrypt
              encrypt the message or inputfile

       -h, --help
              print a help message and exit

       -i inputfile, --inputfile=inputfile
              read from inputfile

       -o outputfile, --outputfile=outputfile
              write to outputfile

       -p, --preserve-spaces
              preserve spaces when decoding/encoding

       -s shiftvalue, --shiftvalue=shiftvalue
              set the shiftvalue

THEORY
       The cipher works by shifting the characters in the original message by
       a certain number, thus creating a new - encrypted - message.

       Take for example the letters from A-Z (original alphabet), and another
       alphabet (shifted alphabet), in which each letter has been shifted by
       the number 5 (shiftvalue):

       Original Alphabet:       Shifted Alphabet:
                 A                        F
                 B                        G
                 C                        H
                 D                        I
                 E                        J
                 F                        K
                 G                        L
                 H                        M
                 I                        N
                 J                        O
                 K                        P
                 L                        Q
                 M                        R
                 N                        S
                 O                        T
                 P                        U
                 Q                        V
                 R                        W
                 S                        X
                 T                        Y
                 U                        Z
                 V                        A
                 W                        B
                 X                        C
                 Y                        D
                 Z                        E

       Suppose now, that the message to encrypt is: THIS IS THE SECRET MESSAGE

       By making use of the above table, every character of the original
       message can be mapped to its corresponding character in the shifted
       alphabet.

       The encrypted message therefore becomes: YMNX NX YMJ XJHWJY RJXXFLJ

       To decrypt a message, knowledge of the shiftvalue (encryption key) is
       required. Decryption works by reverse shifting (subtracting) the given
       encryption key from every letter, thus obtaining the original message.

       Whereas the classical Caesar cipher only uses capital letters from A-Z,
       as in the example above, this implementation is capable of transforming
       all displayable ASCII characters (Hex 20 - Hex 7E).

       Note however, that caesarcipher should not be used for serious
       encryption purposes, as the algorithm is not inherently safe.

       The Caesar cipher is named after Julius Caesar (100 BC - 44 BC).

EXAMPLES
       1. Encode the message: "Secret Message" with a shift value of 21 and
       write it to stdout.

       caesarcipher -e -s 21 "Secret Message"

       2. Decode the string "123456789" with a shift value of 1.

       caesarcipher -d -s 1 123456789

       3. Encode the contents of file orig.txt with a shift value of -179 and
       preserve spaces. Write the result to encrypted.txt.

       caesarcipher -e -s -179 -p -i ~/orig.txt -o ~/encrypted.txt
