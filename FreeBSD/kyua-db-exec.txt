KYUA-DB-EXEC(1)         FreeBSD General Commands Manual        KYUA-DB-EXEC(1)

NAME
     kyua db-exec – Executes a SQL statement in a results file

SYNOPSIS
     kyua db-exec [--no-headers] [--results-file file] statement

DESCRIPTION
     The kyua db-exec command provides a way to execute an arbitrary SQL
     statement within the database.  This command is mostly intended to aid in
     debugging, but can also be used to extract information from the database
     when the current interfaces do not provide the desired functionality.

     The input database must exist.  It makes no sense to use kyua db-exec on
     a nonexistent or empty database.

     The kyua db-exec command takes one or more arguments, all of which are
     concatenated to form a single SQL statement.  Once the statement is
     executed, kyua db-exec prints the resulting table on the screen, if any.

     The following subcommand options are recognized:

     --no-headers
         Avoids printing the headers of the table in the output of the
         command.

     --results-file path, -s path
         Specifies the results file to operate on.  Defaults to ‘LATEST’,
         which causes kyua db-exec to automatically load the latest results
         file from the current test suite.

         The following values are accepted:

         ‘LATEST’
             Requests the load of the latest results file available for the
             test suite rooted at the current directory.

         Directory
             Requests the load of the latest results file available for the
             test suite rooted at the given directory.

         Test suite name
             Requests the load of the latest results file available for the
             given test suite.

         Results identifier
             Requests the load of a specific results file.

         Explicit file name (aka everything else)
             Load the specified results file.

         See Results files for more details.

   Results files
     Results files contain, as their name implies, the results of the
     execution of a test suite.  Each test suite executed by kyua-test(1)
     generates a new results file, and such results files can be loaded later
     on by inspection commands such as kyua-report(1) to analyze their
     contents.

     Results files support identifier-based lookups and also path name
     lookups.  The differences between the two are described below.

     The default naming scheme for the results files provides simple support
     for identifier-based lookups and historical recording of test suite runs.
     Each results file is given an identifier derived from the test suite that
     generated it and the time the test suite was run.  Kyua can later look up
     results files by these fields.

     The identifier follows this pattern:

           <test_suite>.<YYYYMMDD>-<HHMMSS>-<uuuuuu>

     where ‘test_suite’ is the path to the root of the test suite that was run
     with all slashes replaced by underscores and ‘YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-uuuuuu’ is
     a timestamp with microsecond resolution.

     When using the default naming scheme, results files are stored in the
     ~/.kyua/store/ subdirectory and each file holds a name of the form:

           ~/.kyua/store/results.<identifier>.db

     Results files are simple SQLite databases with the schema described in
     the /usr/share/kyua/store/schema_v?.sql files.  For details on the
     schema, please refer to the heavily commented SQL file.

EXIT STATUS
     The kyua db-exec command returns 0 on success or 1 if the SQL statement
     is invalid or fails to run.

     Additional exit codes may be returned as described in kyua(1).
