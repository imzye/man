NAME
               openca-ocspd - OCSP Daemon

SYNOPSIS
       openca-ocspd [-d] [-p n] [-b address] [-c file] [-md digest] [-k
       passwd] [-i passin] [-e engine] [-r chroot_dir] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       The openca-ocspd is an RFC2560 compliant OCSPD responder. It can be
       used to verify the status of a certificate using OCSP clients (such as
       Mozilla/Netscape7).

OPTIONS
       -d  detach the main process from the calling process.

       -p n
           specifies the port to bind to. Default is 2560.

       -b address
           specifies the IP address to bind to. Default behaviour is to listen
           to every IP available (equal to '*' value).

       -c file
           specifies the configuration file to be loaded. Default file loaded
           is /usr/local/etc/ocspd.conf.

       -md digest
           specifies the digest to be used when generating responses. Default
           is sha1.

       -k passwd
           specifies the password to be used when loading the private key.

       -i passin
           the key password source. For more information about the format of
           arg see the PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS section in openssl(1).

       -engine id
           specifying an engine (by it's unique id string) will cause the
           responder to attempt to obtain a functional reference to the
           specified engine, thus initialising it if needed. The engine will
           then be set as the default for all available algorithms.

       -r chroot_dir
           Chroot the application into the specified directory.

       -v  this prints extra details about the operations being performed.

NOTES
           Actually not extensive testing has been carried out, anyway this
           daemon is reported to work with Mozilla/Netscape.

           To reload the certificate's db simply send a SIGHUP to the main
           process ( kill -s SIGHUP pid ).

EXAMPLE
               openca-ocspd -c contrib/ocspd.conf
