ACPICONF(8)             FreeBSD System Manager's Manual            ACPICONF(8)

NAME
     acpiconf – control ACPI power management

SYNOPSIS
     acpiconf [-h] [-i batt] [-k ack] [-s type]

DESCRIPTION
     The acpiconf utility allows the user control of the ACPI power management
     functions.  The following command-line options are recognized:

     -h             Displays a summary of available options.

     -i batt        Get design information about the specified battery.

     -k ack         Ack or abort a pending suspend request using the argument
                    provided.  Most users should not use this option directly.

     -s type        Enters the specified sleep mode.  Recognized types are 1
                    (only the CPU clock is stopped), 2 (not implemented on
                    most systems but similar to S1), 3 (the CPU context is
                    lost and memory context is preserved), and 4 (the CPU
                    context is lost and memory context is stored to disk).
                    Sleep states may also be given as S1, S2, etc.  The
                    supported states depend on BIOS implementation, including
                    ACPI byte code (AML).  If the /etc/rc.suspend and
                    /etc/rc.resume scripts are executable, they will be run by
                    devd(8) or apmd(8) before and after entering the given
                    sleep state.

                    The /etc/rc.resume script uses the rcorder(8) utility to
                    call scripts in /etc/rc.d/ and the $local_startup
                    directories that have a "resume" KEYWORD.  Called scripts
                    are supplied with single "resume" command line argument.
                    See rc.conf(5) for more information about $local_startup.
