NAME
       Twiggy::TLS - Twiggy server with TLS support.

SYNOPSIS
           twiggy --server Twiggy::TLS --tls-key key.pem --tls-cert cert.pem

       See "ATTRIBUTES" for more details.

           use Twiggy::Server::TLS;

           my $server = Twiggy::Server::TLS->new(
               host     => $host,
               port     => $port,
               tls_key  => $key_filename,
               tls_cert => $cert_filename
           );

           AE::cv->recv;

DESCRIPTION
       Twiggy::TLS extends Twiggy with a TLS support.

ATTRIBUTES
       All files must be in PEM format. You can merge multiply entities in a
       one file (like server key and certificate).

   tls_version
       Sets the version of the SSL protocol used to transmit data. The default
       is "SSLv23:!SSLv2". See "SSL_version" of IO::Socket::SSL for other
       values.

   tls_ciphers
       This directive describes the list of cipher suites the server supports
       for establishing a secure connection. Cipher suites are specified in
       the OpenSSL cipherlist format
       <http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html#CIPHER_STRINGS>.

       The default is "HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5".

   tls_key
       Path to the server private key file.

   tls_cert
       Path to the server certificate file.

   tls_verify
       Controls the verification of the peer identity. Possible values are:

       "off"
           Default. Disable peer verification.

       "on"
           Request peer certificate and verify it against CA. You can specify
           CA certificate with "tls_ca" option.

       "optional"
           Same as "on", but allows users that has not passed verification.

   tls_ca
       Path to file that contains CA certificate. Used for peer verification.

TLS INFORMATION
       TLS connection information stored in the environment key "psgi.tls",
       see Twiggy::TLS::Info.

DEBUGGING
       You can set the "TWIGGY_DEBUG" environment variable to get diagnostic
       information.
