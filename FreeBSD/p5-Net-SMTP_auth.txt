NAME
       Net::SMTP_auth - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Client with
       AUTHentication

SYNOPSIS
           use Net::SMTP_auth;

           # Constructors
           $smtp = Net::SMTP_auth->new('mailhost');
           $smtp = Net::SMTP_auth->new('mailhost', Timeout => 60);

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements a client interface to the SMTP and ESMTP
       protocol AUTH service extension, enabling a perl5 application to talk
       to and authenticate against SMTP servers. This documentation assumes
       that you are familiar with the concepts of the SMTP protocol described
       in RFC821 and with the AUTH service extension described in RFC2554.

       A new Net::SMTP_auth object must be created with the new method. Once
       this has been done, all SMTP commands are accessed through this object.

       The Net::SMTP_auth class is a subclass of Net::SMTP, which itself is a
       subclass of Net::Cmd and IO::Socket::INET.

EXAMPLES
       This example authenticates via CRAM-MD5 and sends a small message to
       the postmaster at the SMTP server known as mailhost:

           #!/usr/bin/perl -w

           use Net::SMTP_auth;

           $smtp = Net::SMTP_auth->new('mailhost');
           $smtp->auth('CRAM-MD5', 'user', 'password');

           $smtp->mail($ENV{USER});
           $smtp->to('postmaster');

           $smtp->data();
           $smtp->datasend("To: postmaster\n");
           $smtp->datasend("\n");
           $smtp->datasend("A simple test message\n");
           $smtp->dataend();

           $smtp->quit;

CONSTRUCTOR
       new Net::SMTP_auth [ HOST, ] [ OPTIONS ]
           This is the constructor for a new Net::SMTP_auth object. It is
           taken from Net::SMTP as all other methods (except auth and
           auth_types) are, too.

METHODS
       Unless otherwise stated all methods return either a true or false
       value, with true meaning that the operation was a success. When a
       method states that it returns a value, failure will be returned as
       undef or an empty list.

       auth_types ()
           Returns the AUTH methods supported by the server as an array or in
           a space separated string. This string is exacly the line given by
           the SMTP server after the "EHLO" command containing the keyword
           "AUTH".

       auth ( AUTH, USER, PASSWORD )
           Authenticates the user "USER" via the authentication method "AUTH"
           and the password "PASSWORD". Returns true if successful and false
           if the authentication failed. Remember that the connection is not
           closed if the authentication fails. You may issue a different
           authentication attempt. If you once are successfully authenticated,
           you cannot send the "AUTH" command again.

           The "AUTH" method "NTLM" is supported via Authen::NTLM (thanks to
           James Fryman).
