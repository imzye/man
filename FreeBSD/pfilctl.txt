PFILCTL(8)              FreeBSD System Manager's Manual             PFILCTL(8)

NAME
     pfilctl – pfil(9) control utility

SYNOPSIS
     pfilctl heads
     pfilctl hooks
     pfilctl link ⟨-i | -o⟩ [-a] hook head
     pfilctl unlink ⟨-i | -o⟩ hook head

DESCRIPTION
     The pfilctl utility is intended to view and change configuration of the
     pfil(9) packet filtering hooks and filters on them.

COMMANDS
     heads   List available packet filtering points.

     hooks   List available packet filters.

     link ⟨-i | -o⟩ [-a] hook head
             Link hook to head.  With the -i flag the hook will be connected
             as input and with -o as output hook.  At least one of -i or -o is
             required.  By default pfilctl will prepend the hook in front of
             other hooks if any present: new hook will be as close to the wire
             as possible, so that on input it will be the first filter and on
             output it will be the last.  Adding the -a flag switches to
             appending new hook instead of prepending.

     unlink ⟨-i | -o⟩ hook head
             Unlink hook on head.  At least one of -i or -o is required.  With
             the -i flag the hook will be removed from the input list of hooks
             and with -o on output list.
