ZPOOL-ADD(8)            FreeBSD System Manager's Manual           ZPOOL-ADD(8)

NAME
     zpool-add – add vdevs to ZFS storage pool

SYNOPSIS
     zpool add [-fgLnP] [-o property=value] pool vdev…

DESCRIPTION
     Adds the specified virtual devices to the given pool.  The vdev
     specification is described in the Virtual Devices section of
     zpoolconcepts(7).  The behavior of the -f option, and the device checks
     performed are described in the zpool create subcommand.

     -f      Forces use of vdevs, even if they appear in use or specify a
             conflicting replication level.  Not all devices can be overridden
             in this manner.

     -g      Display vdev, GUIDs instead of the normal device names.  These
             GUIDs can be used in place of device names for the zpool
             detach/offline/remove/replace commands.

     -L      Display real paths for vdevs resolving all symbolic links.  This
             can be used to look up the current block device name regardless
             of the /dev/disk path used to open it.

     -n      Displays the configuration that would be used without actually
             adding the vdevs.  The actual pool creation can still fail due to
             insufficient privileges or device sharing.

     -P      Display real paths for vdevs instead of only the last component
             of the path.  This can be used in conjunction with the -L flag.

     -o property=value
             Sets the given pool properties.  See the zpoolprops(7) manual
             page for a list of valid properties that can be set.  The only
             property supported at the moment is ashift.
