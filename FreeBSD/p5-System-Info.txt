NAME
       System::Info - Factory for system specific information objects

SYNOPSIS
           use System::Info;

           my $si = System::Info->new;

           printf "Hostname:              %s\n", $si->host;
           printf "Number of CPU's:       %s\n", $si->ncpu;
           printf "Processor type:        %s\n", $si->cpu_type; # short
           printf "Processor description: %s\n", $si->cpu;      # long
           printf "OS and version:        %s\n", $si->os;

       or

           use System::Info qw( sysinfo );
           printf "[%s]\n", sysinfo ();

       or

           $ perl -MSystem::Info=si_uname -le print+si_uname

DESCRIPTION
       System::Info tries to present system-related information, like number
       of CPU's, architecture, OS and release related information in a system-
       independent way.  This releases the user of this module of the need to
       know if the information comes from Windows, Linux, HP-UX, AIX, Solaris,
       Irix, or VMS, and if the architecture is i386, x64, pa-risc2, or arm.

METHODS
   System::Info->new
       Factory method, with fallback to the information in "POSIX::uname ()".

   sysinfo
       "sysinfo" returns a string with "host", "os" and "cpu_type".

   sysinfo_hash
       "sysinfo_hash" returns a hash reference with basic system information,
       like:

         { cpu       => 'Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6820HQ CPU @ 2.70GHz (GenuineIntel 2700MHz)',
           cpu_count => '1 [8 cores]',
           cpu_cores => 8,
           cpu_type  => 'x86_64',
           distro    => 'openSUSE Tumbleweed 20171030',
           hostname  => 'foobar',
           os        => 'linux - 4.13.10-1-default [openSUSE Tumbleweed 20171030]',
           osname    => 'Linux',
           osvers    => '4.13.10-1-default'
           }

   si_uname (@args)
       This class gathers most of the uname(1) info, make a comparable
       version. Takes almost the same arguments:

           a for all (can be omitted)
           n for nodename
           s for os name and version
           m for cpu name
           c for cpu count
           p for cpu_type
