xtset(1)                FreeBSD General Commands Manual               xtset(1)

NAME
     xtset – Set title text for xterm

SYNOPSIS
     xtset [-i] [-t] text

DESCRIPTION
     xtset writes an xterm ``set title text'' command sequence based on the
     text argument to stdout.  If the TERM environment variable does not start
     with xterm, xtset does nothing.

   OPTIONS
     -t      Set the title only.

     -i      Set the icon name only.

     By default, xtset sets both the title and the icon name.

   METAVARIABLES
     A number of metavariables allow substituting environmental information:

     %h      is replaced by the hostname, excluding domain name.

     %H      is replaced by the hostname, including domain name if gethostname
             returns it.

     %d      is replaced by the current directory name.

     %D      is replaced by the current directory name, only last part (unless
             this is src, man, doc, etc., in which case the previous part is
             included as well).

     %u      is replaced by the current user name.

     %g      is replaced by the current group name.

     %U      is replaced by the current real user name.

     %G      is replaced by the current real group name.

     %m      is replaced by the octal current umask.

     %e      is replaced by the value of environment variable XTXTRA or null
             string.

     %t      is replaced by the complete name of the stdin terminal, if it is
             a terminal.

     %T      is replaced by the last part of the stdin file name, if it is a
             terminal.

     %%      is replaced by the real percent sign.

ENVIRONMENT
     Uses the TERM and XTXTRA variables.

FILES
     xtset always writes to stdout.

EXAMPLES
           xtset -i Foo

     will expand to

           Foo
     but only on the icon.  The title will remain unchanged.

           xtset %d@%h (%u:%g)

     might expand to

           /home/sol/msmith@rheya (msmith:group2)"

           xtset -t %u (%T) %h:%D
           xtset -i %u@%h:%D

     might set the title text to

           root (ttyp0) myhost:usr/src

     and the icon text to

           root@myhost:usr/src
