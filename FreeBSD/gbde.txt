DESCRIPTION
     NOTICE: Please be aware that this code has not yet received much review
     and analysis by qualified cryptographers and therefore should be
     considered a slightly suspect experimental facility.

     We cannot at this point guarantee that the on-disk format will not change
     in response to reviews or bug-fixes, so potential users are advised to be
     prepared that dump(8)/restore(8) based migrations may be called for in
     the future.

     The gbde utility is the only official operation and management interface
     for the gbde(4) GEOM based disk encryption kernel facility.  The
     interaction between the gbde utility and the kernel part is not a
     published interface.

     The operational aspect consists of two subcommands: one to open and
     attach a device to the in-kernel cryptographic gbde module (attach), and
     one to close and detach a device (detach).

     The management part allows initialization of the master key and lock
     sectors on a device (init), initialization and replacement of pass-
     phrases (setkey), and key invalidation (nuke) and blackening (destroy)
     functions.

     The -l lockfile argument is used to supply the lock selector data.  If no
     -l option is specified, the first sector is used for this purpose.

     The -L new-lockfile argument specifies the lock selector file for the key
     initialized with the init subcommand or modified with the setkey
     subcommand.

     The -n key argument can be used to specify to which of the four keys the
     operation applies.  A value of 1 to 4 selects the specified key, a value
     of 0 (the default) means “this key” (i.e., the key used to gain access to
     the device) and a value of -1 means “all keys”.

     The -f filename specifies an optional parameter file for use under
     initialization.

     Alternatively, the -i option toggles an interactive mode where a template
     file with descriptions of the parameters can be interactively edited.

     The -p pass-phrase argument specifies the pass-phrase used for opening
     the device.  If not specified, the controlling terminal will be used to
     prompt the user for the pass-phrase.  Be aware that using this option may
     expose the pass-phrase to other users who happen to run ps(1) or similar
     while the command is running.

     The -P new-pass-phrase argument can be used to specify the new pass-
     phrase to the init and setkey subcommands.  If not specified, the user is
     prompted for the new pass-phrase on the controlling terminal.  Be aware
     that using this option may expose the pass-phrase to other users who
     happen to run ps(1) or similar while the command is running.

     The -k keyfile argument specifies a key file to be used in combination
     with the pass-phrase (whether the pass-phrase is specified on the command
     line or entered from the terminal) for opening the device.  The device
     will only be opened if the contents of the key file and the pass-phrase
     are both correct.

     The -K new-keyfile argument can be used to specify a new key file to the
     init and setkey subcommands.  If not specified, no key file will be used
     (even if one was previously used).

EXAMPLES
     To initialize a device, using default parameters:

           gbde init /dev/ada0s1f -L /etc/ada0s1f.lock

     To attach an encrypted device:

           gbde attach ada0s1f -l /etc/ada0s1f.lock

     The encrypted device has the suffix .bde so a typical command to create
     and mount a file system would be:

           newfs /dev/ada0s1f.bde
           mount /dev/ada0s1f.bde /secret

     To detach an encrypted device:

           gbde detach ada0s1f

     Please notice that detaching an encrypted device corresponds to
     physically removing it, do not forget to unmount the file system first.

     To initialize the second key using a detached lockfile and a trivial
     pass-phrase:

           gbde setkey ada0s1f -n 2 -P foo -L key2.lockfile

     To invalidate your own masterkey:

           gbde nuke ada0s1f

     This will overwrite your masterkey sector with zeros, and results in a
     diagnostic if you try to use the key again.  You can also destroy the
     other three copies of the masterkey with the -n argument.

     You can also invalidate your masterkey without leaving a tell-tale sector
     full of zeros:

           gbde destroy ada0s1f

     This will overwrite the information fields in your masterkey sector,
     encrypt it and write it back.  You get a (different) diagnostic if you
     try to use it.
