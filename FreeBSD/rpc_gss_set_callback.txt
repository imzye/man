RPC_GSS_SET_CALLBACK(3)                       FreeBSD Library Functions Manual

NAME
     rpc_gss_set_callback – Register a security context creation callback

LIBRARY
     RPC GSS-API Authentication Library (librpcsec_gss, -lrpcsec_gss)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <rpc/rpcsec_gss.h>

     bool_t
     (*callback)(struct svc_req *req, gss_cred_id_t deleg,
         gss_ctx_id_t gss_context, rpc_gss_lock_t *lock, void **cookie);

     bool_t
     rpc_gss_set_callback(rpc_gss_callback_t *cb);

DESCRIPTION
     Register a function which will be called when new security contexts are
     created on a server.  This function will be called on the first RPC
     request which uses that context and has the opportunity of rejecting the
     request (for instance after matching the request credentials to an access
     control list).  To accept the new security context, the callback should
     return TRUE, otherwise FALSE.  If the callback accepts a context, it
     becomes responsible for the lifetime of the delegated client credentials
     (if any).

     It is also possible to 'lock' the values of service and quality of
     protection used by the context.  If a context is locked, any subsequent
     requests which use different values for service and quality of protection
     will be rejected.

PARAMETERS
     cb               A structure containing the RPC program and version for
                      this callback and a function which will be called when
                      new contexts are created for the given RPC program and
                      version

     req              The RPC request using the new context

     deleg            GSS-API delegated credentials (if any)

     gss_context      The GSS-API context

     lock             A structure used to enforce a particular QOP and
                      service.  Set lock->locked to TRUE to lock the service
                      and QOP values

     cookie           The callback function may set *cookie to any pointer
                      sized value.  This value can be accessed during the
                      lifetime of the context via rpc_gss_getcred().

RETURN VALUES
     Returns TRUE if the callback was registered successfully or FALSE
     otherwise

HISTORY
     The rpc_gss_set_callback function first appeared in FreeBSD 8.0.

BUGS
     There is no mechanism for informing a server when a security context has
     been deleted.  This makes it difficult to allocate resources (e.g. to
     return via the callback's cookie argument).
