UHIDD.CONF(5)             FreeBSD File Formats Manual            UHIDD.CONF(5)

NAME
     uhidd.conf – uhidd configuration file

DESCRIPTION
     The uhidd.conf configuration file is read at initial startup of the
     uhidd(8) daemon to specify the configuration parameters for each class
     driver or the daemon itself.

     The configuration file consists of a list of options.  options are
     assignemnts written in the form “name=value”.  A option name can be a
     device identifier or a driver parameter.  A value is either a quoted
     string or a list of sub options.  The syntax of a option with a list of
     options as value is:

           name={
                   option
                   ...
                   option
           }

     The following is a list of options supported:

     device_identifier
                   (list) The device_identifier consists of vendor id, product
                   id and the optional interface number. The option name is
                   written in the format vid:pid[:iface].  vid and pid are
                   hexadecimals with prefix “0x”, while iface is a single
                   decimal number (e.g. 0x045e:0x00f9:1).  The value of this
                   option is a list of sub options that apply to the specified
                   device interface. If iface is omitted, sub options apply to
                   all interfaces of the device. Also there is a special
                   device identifier called default.  Sub options under
                   default apply to all the devices.

     detach_kernel_driver
                   (bool) If set to “YES”, the uhidd daemon will detach the
                   active kernel driver attached to the device before
                   attaching itself. Otherwise the daemon will abort and let
                   the kernel driver continue handling the device.

     forced_attach
                   (bool) If set to “YES”, the uhidd daemon will attach the
                   device interface even if there is an active kernel driver
                   attached to the device, or if the daemon fails to detach
                   the kernel driver.

     kbd_attach    (bool) If set to “YES”, enable the keyboard class driver
                   and attach it to the keyboard application collection.

     mouse_attach  (bool) If set to “YES”, enable the mouse class driver and
                   attach it to the mouse application collection.

     vhid_attach   (bool) If set to “YES”, enable the virtual generic HID
                   driver and attach it to any application collection that
                   does not have a specific driver.

     vhid_strip_id
                   (bool) If set to “YES”, instruct the vhid driver to strip
                   the leading report id byte before passing the report to
                   user.

     vhid_devname  (string) Specify the name of the virtual HID device created
                   by the virtual generic HID driver. The default name used
                   for the device is “uvhid”.

     cc_attach     (bool) If set to “YES”, enable the consumer control class
                   driver and attach it to the consumer control application
                   collection. Consumer control driver provides general
                   support for multimedia keys found in USB keyboard.

     cc_keymap     (list) This option specify the keymap for multimedia keys.
                   The value is a list of sub options (key bindings).  Each
                   sub option has the form “usage=keycode” and specify exact
                   one key binding between a USB HID usage and a keycode. For
                   example, Mute=“0x60” will bind multimedia key Mute to
                   keycode 0x60. Normally, mapping usage to already assigned
                   keycodes and causing conflicts is not desired.  See
                   FREEKEYS section below for a list of currently unused
                   keycodes. Also refer to the HID Usage Tables in the USB
                   specification for a list of usage names.

EXAMPLES
     #
     # For all devices, attach mouse and consumer control driver but
     # do not attach keyboard and vhid driver. (say, keyboard is
     # handled by the kernel driver ukbd(4) instead). Provide a global
     # keymap which binds 4 multimedia keys found on most multimedia
     # USB keyboard.

FREEKEYS
     FreeBSD keyboard infrastructure support at most 127 keycodes. Most of the
     keycodes have been assigned. Unassigned keycodes can be bound to
     multimedia keys without problem. Among those already assigned keycodes,
     rarely used ones can be reassigned to multimedia keys as well. The
     following is a list of keycodes that can probably be “safely” reassigned.

     Unused keycodes       Currently unused keycodes include: 0x54, 0x5A,
                           0x5F, 0x60, 0x62, 0x63, 0x6F, 0x71, 0x72, 0x74.

     Rarely used keycodes  0x73, 0x70, 0x7D, 0x79, 0x7B, 0x5C, 0xF2, 0xF1,
                           0x78, 0x77, 0x76.  These keycodes are most likely
                           not used for English keyboard.

     F13 - F24             0x64, 0x65, 0x66, 0x67, 0x68, 0x69, 0x6A, 0x6B,
                           0x6C, 0x6D, 0x6E, 0x76. These keycodes are for
                           extra function keys found on some keyboards and can
                           be reassigned if your keyboard doesn't have them.
