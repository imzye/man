NAME
       wikidoc - convert mixed Pod and wikidoc text to Pod

VERSION
       version 0.21

SYNOPSIS
        wikidoc [options] [inputfile] [outputfile]

        options:
           --comments or -c
               include wikidoc comment-blocks

           --define <KEYWORD=VALUE> or -d <KEYWORD=VALUE>
               define keyword for expansion

           --help or -h
               give usage information

           --length <INTEGER> or -l <INTEGER>
               set the length of the comment block prefix, e.g. 3 means "###"

           --version or -V
               print the version number of this program

        inputfile:
           A filename from which Pod and wikidoc will be extracted.  To read
           from STDIN, use the special name '-'.  If no filename is given, data
           will be read from STDIN if wikidoc is receiving data from a pipe,
           otherwise a syntax error will occur.

        outputfile:
           A filename for the generated Pod.  If no filename is given, Pod
           will be written to STDOUT.

DESCRIPTION
       "wikidoc" processes Pod and wikidoc, converting the wikidoc to Pod, and
       then writing the combined document back to a file or standard output.

       See documentation for Pod::WikiDoc for details.

DIAGNOSTICS
       "wikidoc: Can't use the same file for input and output."

       Because an output file is clobbered, using the same input and output
       file would destroy the input and produce no output.
