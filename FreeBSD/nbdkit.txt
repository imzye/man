NAME
       nbdkit-blocksize-filter - nbdkit blocksize filter

SYNOPSIS
        nbdkit --filter=blocksize plugin [minblock=SIZE] [maxdata=SIZE] \
            [maxlen=SIZE] [plugin-args...]

DESCRIPTION
       "nbdkit-blocksize-filter" is a filter that ensures various block size
       limits are met on transactions presented to the plugin.  The NBD
       protocol permits clients to send requests with a granularity as small
       as 1 byte or as large as nearly 4 gigabytes, although it suggests that
       portable clients should align requests to 512 bytes and not exceed 32
       megabytes without prior coordination with the server.

       Meanwhile, some plugins require requests to be aligned to 512-byte
       multiples, or may enforce a maximum transaction size to bound the time
       or memory resources spent by any one command (note that nbdkit itself
       refuses a read or write larger than 64 megabytes, while many other NBD
       servers limit things to 32 megabytes).  The blocksize filter can be
       used to modify the client requests to meet the plugin restrictions.

PARAMETERS
       The nbdkit-blocksize-filter accepts the following parameters.

       minblock=SIZE
           The minimum block size and alignment to pass to the plugin.  This
           must be a power of two, and no larger than 64k.  If omitted, this
           defaults to 1 (that is, no minimum size restrictions).  The filter
           rounds up read requests to alignment boundaries, performs read-
           modify-write cycles for any unaligned head or tail of a write or
           zero request, and silently ignores any unaligned head or tail of a
           trim request.  The filter also truncates the plugin size down to an
           aligned value (as it cannot safely operate on the unaligned tail).
           If you need to round the image size up instead to access the last
           few bytes, combine this filter with nbdkit-truncate-filter(1).

           This parameter understands the suffix 'k' for 1024.

       maxdata=SIZE
           The maximum block size for any single transaction with data (read
           and write).  If omitted, this defaults to 64 megabytes (that is,
           the nbdkit maximum).  This need not be a power of two, but must be
           an integer multiple of "minblock".  The filter fragments any larger
           client request into multiple plugin requests.

           This parameter understands the suffixes 'k', 'M', and 'G' for
           powers of 1024.

       maxlen=SIZE
           The maximum length for any single transaction without data (trim,
           zero or extents).  If omitted, this defaults to 0xffffffff rounded
           down to "minsize" alignment (that is, the inherent 32-bit limit of
           the NBD protocol).  This need not be a power of two, but must be an
           integer multiple of "minblock", and should be at least as large as
           "maxdata".  The filter fragments any larger client request into
           multiple plugin requests.

           This parameter understands the suffixes 'k', 'M', and 'G' for
           powers of 1024.

EXAMPLES
       Allow an arbitrary client to use the VDDK plugin (which is limited to
       512-byte blocks), without having to fix the client to avoid sending
       unaligned requests:

        nbdkit --filter=blocksize vddk minblock=512 file=/absolute/path/to/file.vmdk

       Allow an arbitrary client tuned to nbdkit's 64 megabyte sizing to
       connect to a remote server that insists on 32 megabyte sizing, via the
       nbd plugin:

        nbdkit --filter=blocksize nbd maxdata=32M socket=/path/to/socket

       Serve a file as if it were a block device that insists on 4k alignment,
       while still allowing access to any unaligned bytes at the end of the
       file:

        nbdkit --filter=blocksize --filter=truncate file /path/to/file \
        minblock=4k round-up=4k

FILES
       $filterdir/nbdkit-blocksize-filter.so
           The filter.

           Use "nbdkit --dump-config" to find the location of $filterdir.
