Baseball::Sabermetrics(3)                  User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Baseball::Sabermetrics - A Baseball Statistics Module

SYNOPSIS
       Baseball::Sabermetrics provides an easy interface for calculating
       baseball statistics, given a data importer.  In this package, I've
       written CPBL.pm for (Chinese Professional Baseball League,
       <http://www.cpbl.com.tw>).

         use Baseball::Sabermetrics;
         use Baseball::Sabermetrics::CPBL;

         my $league = Baseball::Sabermetrics->new(league => 'CPBL');

         # Actually these are predefined.
         # Those data with 'p_' or '_allowed' here are for seperating pitchers
         # and batters.

         $league->define(
             rc => 'ab * obp',
             babip => '(h_allowed - hr_allowed) / (p_pa - h_allowed - p_so - p_bb - hr_allowed',
             # what started with '$' will be reserved.
             # Players have team and league predefined, and team has league.
             formula1 => 'hr / $_->team->hr';
             formula2 => 'hr / $_->league->hr';
             complex => sub {
                   print "You can write a sub directly\n";
                   $_->slg - $_->ba;
             },
             ...
         );

         # Some formulas can be applied to players, teams, and league, depend on what
         # columns are used in the formula.  For example, ab and obp are defined for
         # players, teams, and league, so that rc is available for all of them.

         # top 5 obp of teams
         $_->print qw/ team name ba obp slg isop / for $league->top('teams', 5, 'obp');

         # top 10 obp of players
         $_->print qw/ team name ba obp slg isop / for $league->top('players', 10, 'obp');

         # show a player's information
         $league->players('Chien-Ming Wang')->print qw/ win lose ip so bb whip go_ao /;
         $league->teams('Yankees')->players('Chien-Ming Wang')->print qw/ win lose ip so bb whip go_ao /;

         # show team statistics data (accumulated from players')
         $league->{Yankees}->print qw/ win lose ip so bb whip go_ao /;

         # give a brief report for pitchers/batters of the team
         $league->{Yankees}->report_pitchers qw/ name ip p_so p_bb whip go_ab /;
         $league->{Yankees}->report_batters  qw/ name ba obp slg isop /;

         $league->report_teams qw/ name win lose era obp /;

         # show all available formula
         print join ' ', $league->formula_list;

Data Structure
       Baseball::Sabermetrics is aimed for providing a base class of your
       interested teams (a league, for example).  You'll need to provide a
       data retriever to pull data out.  The following example shows how you
       have to fill data into this structure.

        $league = {
           teams => {
               Yankees => {
                   players => {
                       "Chien-Ming Wang" => {
                           bio => {
                               bats => 'right', # coule be left, switch
                               throws => 'right',
                           },
                           ip => 57.33333333333,
                           game => 9,
                              ...
                           fielding => {
                               p => {
                                   tc => 43,
                                   pop => 4,
                                   ...
                               },
                               # b1 => { }, b2 => { }, b3 => { },
                               # first, second and thrid baseman should be
                               # b1, b2, and b3 respectively for convenient in
                               # fielding context.  Because the initial of the
                               # name of subroutine can't be a number in perl.
                           },
                       };
                       ...
                   }
               },
               Athletics => {
                   ...
               },
           },
        };

TERMS
       Available terms of players (including teams and league, which are
       accumulated from players and could be treated as an abstract player)
       are:

           # pitching
           p_game win lose tie gs sv bs hld cg sho ip p_pa np h_allowed
           hr_allowed sh_allowed sf_allowed p_bb p_ibb hb p_so wp bk ra er

           # batting
           pa ab rbi r h 1b 2b 3b hr tb dp sh sf ibb bb hbp so sb cs
           tc po a e f_dp ppo tp pb c_cs c_sb

           # fielding
           pos fgame tc po a e f_dp tp pb c_cs c_sb

       And there are additional terms for team:

           game win lose tie

FUNCTIONS
       new([%hash])
           Create sabermetric data set of a group of teams.  The following
           keys are supported:

                   league: a string like 'CPBL', which is a module and has to
                   be defined in Baseball::Sabermetrics::League::CPBL.

                   data: If your league is not exists there, you can feed in a
                   structure mentioned above.

                   Accumulate: If $hash{Accumulate} is false, players data
                   will not be accumulated to their teams and the league (and
                   therefore team-wise and league-wise statistics are not
                   allowed).  Default is to accumulate stats.

       players([$name])
               for ($league->players) { ... }
               # or specify the name for the player
               print $league->players('Someone')->obp;

       teams([$name])
               for ($league->teams) { ... }
               # or specify the name for the team
               print $league->teams('Someone')->win;

       pitchers
           Return all pitchers, i.e., NP (Number of Pitches) > 0.

       batters
           Return all batters, i.e., PA (Plate Appearances) > 0.
