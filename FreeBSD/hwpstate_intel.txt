HWPSTATE_INTEL(4)      FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual      HWPSTATE_INTEL(4)

NAME
     hwpstate_intel – Intel Speed Shift Technology driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into your kernel place the following line in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device cpufreq

DESCRIPTION
     The hwpstate_intel driver provides support for hardware-controlled
     performance states on Intel platforms, also known as Intel Speed Shift
     Technology.

LOADER TUNABLES
     hint.hwpstate_intel.0.disabled
             Can be used to disable hwpstate_intel, allowing other compatible
             drivers to manage performance states, like est(4).  Defaults to
             "0" (enabled).

     machdep.hwpstate_pkg_ctrl
             Selects between package-level control (the default) and per-core
             control.  "1" selects package-level control and "0" selects core-
             level control.

SYSCTL VARIABLES
     The following sysctl(8) values are available

     dev.hwpstate_intel.%d.%desc
             Describes the attached driver

     dev.hwpstate_intel.0.%desc: Intel Speed Shift

     dev.hwpstate_intel.%d.%driver
             Driver in use, always hwpstate_intel.

     dev.hwpstate_intel.0.%driver: hwpstate_intel

     dev.hwpstate_intel.%d.%parent
             The CPU that is exposing these frequencies.  For example cpu0.

     dev.hwpstate_intel.0.%parent: cpu0

     dev.hwpstate_intel.%d.epp
             Energy/Performance Preference.  Valid values range from 0 to 100.
             Setting this field conveys a hint to the hardware regarding a
             preference towards performance (at value 0), energy efficiency
             (at value 100), or somewhere in between.

     dev.hwpstate_intel.0.epp: 0

COMPATIBILITY
     hwpstate_intel is only found on supported Intel CPUs.
