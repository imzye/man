ML1(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual (con)              ML1(1)

NAME
     ml1 – ML/I macro processor

SYNOPSIS
     ml1 [-v] [-w workspace] [-o outputfile] [-o outputfile] [-o outputfile]
         [-o outputfile] [-l listingfile] [-d debuggingfile] [file] [file]
         [file] [file] [file]

DESCRIPTION
     ml1 is a general purpose macro processor which allows its users to
     augment any existing programming language by adding new statements (or
     other syntactic forms) of their own choosing and in their own notation.
     These new features must be expandable in terms of the existing language.

     ml1 is also useful for systematic editing, i.e. the replacement of one
     string, possibly involving parameters, by another string throughout a
     program or any other piece of text.

     This manual page merely summarises the ml1 command line options; consult
     the full ML/I documentation for anything else.

     The options are as follows:

     -v

     -V      Print the version number of this implementation of ml1.

     -w n

     -W n    Set the amount of workspace available to ml1 to n words (the
             default is 5000 words).

     -l file

     -L file
             Nominate file as the listing file. The default is that no listing
             is produced.  The name - is taken to mean the standard output.

     -d file

     -D file
             Nominate file as the debugging file. By default, this is the
             standard error stream (usually the user's terminal).  The name -
             is taken to mean the standard output.

     -o file

     -O file
             Nominate file as an output file. Up to four output files may be
             specified; each must be preceded by the -o flag.  If no output
             files are specified, the standard output is used.  An output file
             named - is also taken to be the standard output.

     All other arguments to ml1 are taken to be the names of input files;
     there may be no more than five of these.  If no input file is specified,
     the standard input is used.  The name - is also taken to mean the
     standard input.

DIAGNOSTICS
     The ml1 utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
