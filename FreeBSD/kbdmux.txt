KBDMUX(4)              FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual              KBDMUX(4)

NAME
     kbdmux – keyboard multiplexer

SYNOPSIS
     device kbdmux

     In /boot/device.hints:
     hint.kbdmux.0.disabled="1"

DESCRIPTION
     The kbdmux keyboard driver provides support for basic keyboard
     multiplexing.  It is built around the idea of a “super keyboard”.  The
     kbdmux driver acts as a master keyboard consuming input from all slave
     keyboards attached to it.

     Slave keyboards can be attached to or detached from the kbdmux keyboard
     driver with the kbdcontrol(1) utility.

HISTORY
     The kbdmux module was implemented in FreeBSD 6.0.

CAVEATS
     The kbdmux keyboard driver switches all slave keyboards into K_RAW mode.
     Thus all slave keyboards attached to the kbdmux keyboard share the same
     state.  The kbdmux keyboard is logically equivalent to one keyboard with
     lots of duplicated keys.
