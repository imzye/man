KYUA-TEST(1)            FreeBSD General Commands Manual           KYUA-TEST(1)

NAME
     kyua test – Runs tests

SYNOPSIS
     kyua test [--build-root path] [--kyuafile file] [--results-file file]
               [test_filter1 .. test_filterN]

DESCRIPTION
     The kyua test command loads a test suite definition from a kyuafile(5),
     runs the tests defined in it, and records the results into a new results
     file.  By default, all tests in the test suite are executed but the
     optional arguments to kyua test can be used to select which test programs
     or test cases to run.  These are filters and are described below in Test
     filters.

     Every test executed by kyua test is run under a controlled environment as
     described in Test isolation.

     The following subcommand options are recognized:

     --build-root path
         Specifies the build root in which to find the test programs
         referenced by the Kyuafile, if different from the Kyuafile's
         directory.  See Build directories below for more information.

     --kyuafile path, -k path
         Specifies the Kyuafile to process.  Defaults to a Kyuafile file in
         the current directory.

     --results-file path, -s path
         Specifies the results file to create.  Defaults to ‘LATEST’, which
         causes kyua test to automatically generate a new results file for the
         test run.

         The following values are accepted:

         ‘NEW’
             Requests the automatic generation of a new results filename based
             on the test suite being run and the current time.

         Explicit filename (aka everything else)
             Store the results file where indicated.

         See Results files for more details.

     You can later inspect the results of the test run in more detail by using
     kyua-report(1) or you can execute a single test case with debugging
     functionality by using kyua-debug(1).

   Build directories
     Build directories (or object directories, target directories, product
     directories, etc.) is the concept that allows a developer to keep the
     source tree clean from build products by asking the build system to place
     such build products under a separate subtree.

     Most build systems today support build directories.  For example, the GNU
     Automake/Autoconf build system exposes such concept when invoked as
     follows:

           $ cd my-project-1.0
           $ mkdir build
           $ cd build
           $ ../configure
           $ make

     Under such invocation, all the results of the build are left in the
     my-project-1.0/build/ subdirectory while maintaining the contents of
     my-project-1.0/ intact.

     Because build directories are an integral part of most build systems, and
     because they are a tool that developers use frequently, kyua test
     supports build directories too.  This manifests in the form of kyua test
     being able to run tests from build directories while reading the (often
     immutable) test suite definition from the source tree.

     One important property of build directories is that they follow (or need
     to follow) the exact same layout as the source tree.  For example,
     consider the following directory listings:

           src/Kyuafile
           src/bin/ls/
           src/bin/ls/Kyuafile
           src/bin/ls/ls.c
           src/bin/ls/ls_test.c
           src/sbin/su/
           src/sbin/su/Kyuafile
           src/sbin/su/su.c
           src/sbin/su/su_test.c

           obj/bin/ls/
           obj/bin/ls/ls*
           obj/bin/ls/ls_test*
           obj/sbin/su/
           obj/sbin/su/su*
           obj/sbin/su/su_test*

     Note how the directory layout within src/ matches that of obj/.  The src/
     directory contains only source files and the definition of the test suite
     (the Kyuafiles), while the obj/ directory contains only the binaries
     generated during a build.

     All commands that deal with the workspace support the --build-root path
     option.  When this option is provided, the directory specified by the
     option is considered to be the root of the build directory.  For example,
     considering our previous fake tree layout, we could invoke kyua test as
     any of the following:

           $ kyua test --kyuafile=src/Kyuafile --build-root=obj
           $ cd src && kyua test --build-root=../obj

   Results files
     Results files contain, as their name implies, the results of the
     execution of a test suite.  Each test suite executed by kyua-test(1)
     generates a new results file, and such results files can be loaded later
     on by inspection commands such as kyua-report(1) to analyze their
     contents.

     Results files support identifier-based lookups and also path name
     lookups.  The differences between the two are described below.

     The default naming scheme for the results files provides simple support
     for identifier-based lookups and historical recording of test suite runs.
     Each results file is given an identifier derived from the test suite that
     generated it and the time the test suite was run.  Kyua can later look up
     results files by these fields.

     The identifier follows this pattern:

           <test_suite>.<YYYYMMDD>-<HHMMSS>-<uuuuuu>

     where ‘test_suite’ is the path to the root of the test suite that was run
     with all slashes replaced by underscores and ‘YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-uuuuuu’ is
     a timestamp with microsecond resolution.

     When using the default naming scheme, results files are stored in the
     ~/.kyua/store/ subdirectory and each file holds a name of the form:

           ~/.kyua/store/results.<identifier>.db

     Results files are simple SQLite databases with the schema described in
     the /usr/share/kyua/store/schema_v?.sql files.  For details on the
     schema, please refer to the heavily commented SQL file.

   Test filters
     A test filter is a string that is used to match test cases or test
     programs in a test suite.  Filters have the following form:

           test_program_name[:test_case_name]

     Where ‘test_program_name’ is the name of a test program or a subdirectory
     in the test suite, and ‘test_case_name’ is the name of a test case.

   Test isolation
     The test programs and test cases run by kyua test are all executed in a
     deterministic environment.  This known, clean environment serves to make
     the test execution as reproducible as possible and also to prevent
     clashes between tests that may, for example, create auxiliary files with
     overlapping names.

     For plain test programs and for TAP test programs, the whole test program
     is run under a single instance of the environment described in this page.
     For ATF test programs (see atf(7)), each individual test case and test
     cleanup routine are executed in separate environments.

     Process space
         Each test is executed in an independent processes.  Corollary: the
         test can do whatever it wants to the current process (such as modify
         global variables) without having to undo such changes.

     Session and process group
         The test is executed in its own session and its own process group.
         There is no controlling terminal attached to the session.

         Should the test spawn any children, the children should maintain the
         same session and process group.  Modifying any of these settings
         prevents kyua test from being able to kill any stray subprocess as
         part of the cleanup phase.  If modifying these settings is necessary,
         or if any subprocess started by the test decides to use a different
         process group or session, it is the responsibility of the test to
         ensure those subprocesses are forcibly terminated during cleanup.

     Work directory
         The test is executed in a temporary directory automatically created
         by the runtime engine.  Corollary: the test can write to its current
         directory without needing to clean any files and/or directories it
         creates.  The runtime engine takes care to recursively delete the
         temporary directories after the execution of a test case.  Any file
         systems mounted within the temporary directory are also unmounted.

     Home directory
         The HOME environment variable is set to the absolute path of the work
         directory.

     Umask
         The value of the umask is set to 0022.

     Environment
         The LANG, LC_ALL, LC_COLLATE, LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, LC_MONETARY,
         LC_NUMERIC and LC_TIME variables are unset.

         The TZ variable is set to ‘UTC’.

         The TMPDIR variable is set to the absolute path of the work
         directory.  This is to prevent the test from mistakenly using a
         temporary directory outside of the automatically-managed work
         directory, should the test use the mktemp(3) familiy of functions.

     Process limits
         The maximum soft core size limit is raised to its corresponding hard
         limit.  This is a simple, best-effort attempt at allowing tests to
         dump core for further diagnostic purposes.

     Configuration varibles
         The test engine may pass run-time configuration variables to the test
         program via the environment.  The name of the configuration variable
         is prefixed with ‘TEST_ENV_’ so that a configuration variable of the
         form ‘foo=bar’ becomes accessible in the environment as
         ‘TEST_ENV_foo=bar’.

EXIT STATUS
     The kyua test command returns 0 if all executed test cases pass or 1 if
     any of the executed test cases fails or if any of the given test case
     filters does not match any test case.

     Additional exit codes may be returned as described in kyua(1).

EXAMPLES
   Workflow with results files
     If one runs the following command twice in a row:

           kyua test -k /usr/tests/Kyuafile

     the two executions will generate two different files with names like:

           ~/.kyua/store/results.usr_tests.20140731-150500-196784.db
           ~/.kyua/store/results.usr_tests.20140731-151730-997451.db

     Taking advantage of the default naming scheme, the following commands
     would all generate a report for the results of the latest execution of
     the test suite:

           cd /usr/tests && kyua report
           cd /usr/tests && kyua report --results-file=LATEST
           kyua report --results-file=/usr/tests
           kyua report --results-file=usr_tests
           kyua report --results-file=usr_tests.20140731-151730-997451

     But it is also possible to explicitly load data for older runs or from
     explicitly-named files:

           kyua report \
               --results-file=usr_tests.20140731-150500-196784
           kyua report \
               --results-file=~/.kyua/store/results.usr_tests.20140731-150500-196784.db
