KEYBOARD-DAEMON(1)      FreeBSD General Commands Manual     KEYBOARD-DAEMON(1)

NAME
     keyboard-daemon – read from a keyboard device node and execute commands

SYNOPSIS
     keyboard-daemon [-Vdv] [-f config_file] ⟨device_node⟩

DESCRIPTION
     The keyboard-daemon utility attaches to a given ⟨device_node⟩ and reads
     keypresses from it.

     The options are as follows:

     -V      Return the version of keyboard-daemon.

     -d      Daemonize (run in background).

     -v      Verbose mode (useful for finding scan codes).

     -f config_file
             Specify an alternative configuration file.  The default is for
             /usr/local/etc/keyboard-daemon.conf.

     -p pidfile
             Specify a pidfile.  This only takes effect if -d is specified.

FILES
     /usr/local/etc/keyboard-daemon.conf

EXAMPLES
     Before starting keyboard-daemon, the target ⟨device_node⟩ must be
     disconnected from the kbdmux(4) using kdbcontrol(1), for example using
     FreeBSD:

           # kbdcontrol -A device_node < /dev/console

     This is performed automatically when using the FreeBSD rc script.

DIAGNOSTICS
     The keyboard-daemon utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error
     occurs.
