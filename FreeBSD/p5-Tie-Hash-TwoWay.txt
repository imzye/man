NAME
       Tie::Hash::TwoWay - Perl extension for two-way mapping between two
       disjoint sets

SYNOPSIS
         use Tie::Hash::TwoWay;
         tie %hash, 'Tie::Hash::TwoWay';

         my %list = (
                     Asimov => ['novelist', 'scientist'],
                     King => ['novelist', 'horror'],
                    );


         foreach (keys %list)                  # these are the primary keys of the hash
         {
          $hash{$_} = $list{$_};
         }

         $hash{White} = 'novelist';
         $hash{White} = 'color';

         # these will all print 'yes'
         print 'yes' if exists $hash{scientist};
         print 'yes' if exists $hash{novelist}->{Asimov};
         print 'yes' if exists $hash{novelist}->{King};
         print 'yes' if exists $hash{novelist}->{White};
         print 'yes' if exists $hash{King}->{novelist};

         my $secondary = scalar %hash;
         print "Secondary keys: ";
         print "$_\n" foreach keys %$secondary;

DESCRIPTION
       Tie::Hash::TwoWay will take a list of one-way associations and
       transparently create their reverse.  For instance, say you have a list
       of machines, and a list of classes that each machine belongs to.
       Tie::Hash::TwoWay will take the machines, one by one, with an
       associated array reference of class names, and build the reverse
       mapping of classes to machines.  All the mappings are stored as hashes.
       You can access the secondary mappings as if they were hash keys in
       their own right.

       Deleting a key in either the forward or reverse mapping will delete all
       its mappings in the other direction as well.  If a key has no more
       mappings, the key itself is deleted as well. For example, if you delete
       machine "joe" that was in class "extra", and there are no other
       machines in class "extra", that class will be automatically deleted as
       well.

       Peculiarities, which might be considered bugs:

       Duplicate keys, overlapping between the primary and the secondary, are
       allowed (for instance, a class named the same as a machine).  Fetching
       a key, checking for its existence, and deleting it will go to the
       primary mapping first and then to the secondary.

       The keys of the TwoWay hash are the keys of the primary mapping.  The
       reverse mapping (which is just a hash reference) can be obtained by
       using the scalar operator on the tied hash.

       Everything is stored in hashes for faster access, at the expense of
       memory.

   EXPORT
       Nothing.
