PTHREAD_BARRIERATTR(3)                        FreeBSD Library Functions Manual

NAME
     pthread_barrierattr_destroy, pthread_barrierattr_getpshared,
     pthread_barrierattr_init, pthread_barrierattr_setpshared – manipulate a
     barrier attribute object

LIBRARY
     POSIX Threads Library (libpthread, -lpthread)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <pthread.h>

     int
     pthread_barrierattr_destroy(pthread_barrierattr_t *attr);

     int
     pthread_barrierattr_getpshared(const pthread_barrierattr_t *restrict attr,
         int *restrict pshared);

     int
     pthread_barrierattr_init(pthread_barrierattr_t *attr);

     int
     pthread_barrierattr_setpshared(pthread_barrierattr_t *attr, int pshared);

DESCRIPTION
     The pthread_barrierattr_init() function will initialize attr with default
     attributes.  The pthread_barrierattr_destroy() function will destroy attr
     and release any resources that may have been allocated on its behalf.

     The pthread_barrierattr_getpshared() function will put the value of the
     process-shared attribute from attr into the memory area pointed to by
     pshared.  The pthread_barrierattr_setpshared() function will set the
     process-shared attribute of attr to the value specified in pshared.  The
     argument pshared may have one of the following values:

     PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE      The barrier object it is attached to may
                                  only be accessed by threads in the same
                                  process as the one that created the object.

     PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED       The barrier object it is attached to may be
                                  accessed by threads in processes other than
                                  the one that created the object.

RETURN VALUES
     If successful, all these functions will return zero.  Otherwise, an error
     number will be returned to indicate the error.

     None of these functions will return EINTR.

ERRORS
     The pthread_barrierattr_destroy(), pthread_barrierattr_getpshared() and
     pthread_barrierattr_setpshared() functions may fail if:

     [EINVAL]           The value specified by attr is invalid.

     The pthread_barrierattr_init() function will fail if:

     [ENOMEM]           Insufficient memory to initialize the barrier
                        attribute object attr.

     The pthread_barrierattr_setpshared() function will fail if:

     [EINVAL]           The value specified in pshared is not one of the
                        allowed values.

HISTORY
     The pthread_barrierattr_*() functions first appeared in N:M Threading
     Library (libkse, -lkse) in FreeBSD 5.2, and in 1:1 Threading Library
     (libthr, -lthr) in FreeBSD 5.3.  Support for process-shared barriers
     appeared in FreeBSD 11.0.
