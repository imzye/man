ACPI_ASUS_WMI(4)       FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual       ACPI_ASUS_WMI(4)

NAME
     acpi_asus_wmi – Asus Laptop WMI Extras

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following line in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device acpi_asus_wmi

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           acpi_asus_wmi_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The acpi_asus_wmi driver provides support for the extra WMI-controlled
     gadgets, such as hotkeys and leds, found on Asus laptops.  It allows one
     to use the sysctl(8) interface to manipulate the brightness of the LCD
     panel and keyboard backlight, power on/off different internal components,
     such as WiFi, Bluetooth, camera, cardreader, etc, read some sensors.
     Hotkey events are passed to devd(8) for easy handling in userspace with
     the default configuration in /etc/devd/asus.conf.  Some hotkey events,
     such as keyboard backlight and touchpad control, are handled inside the
     driver.

SYSCTL VARIABLES
     The following sysctls are currently implemented:

     dev.acpi_asus_wmi.0.handle_keys
             Specifies whether driver should handle some harwdare keys, such
             as keyboard backlight, internally.

     Number of other variables under the same sysctl branch are model-
     specific.

     Defaults for these variables can be set in sysctl.conf(5), which is
     parsed at boot-time.
