FLYCAST(1)                          Flycast                         FLYCAST(1)




NAME
       flycast - The Sega Dreamcast, Atomiswave and Naomi emulator.


SYNOPSIS
       flycast [OPTIONS]... [IMAGE FILE]


DESCRIPTION
       flycast is a multi-platform emulator for the Sega Dreamcast, Atomiswave
       and Naomi systems.


EXAMPLE COMMANDLINE
       No command line options will start flycast and load all values from the
       config file.
              flycast


       Override the image specified in the config file to load a specific
       image. flycast /path/to/your/image.gdi


       Start flycast in full screen.
              flycast -config window:fullscreen=yes


CONFIG FILE
       The config file for flycast can be found at:


              ~/.config/flycast/emu.cfg

VMU SAVE FILE
       The VMU save files can be found at ~/.local/share/flycast/, by default
       flycast will create two VMU files for the first controller:


              ~/.local/share/flycast/vmu_save_A1.bin
              ~/.local/share/flycast/vmu_save_A2.bin

BIOS AND FLASH ROMS
       flycast needs the original Atomiswave or Naomi BIOS files. The
       Dreamcast BIOS isn't needed in most cases but is recommended. For
       copyright reasons it is not possible to distribute them bundled with
       flycast, so you have to dump them from your own Dreamcast. flycast will
       look for these files in:


              ~/.local/share/flycast/data/dc_boot.bin
              ~/.local/share/flycast/data/naomi.zip
              ~/.local/share/flycast/data/awbios.zip

CONTROLS
       flycast uses the kernel event devices for capturing input. You can
       define the evdev device id in the config file:

              [input]
              evdev_device_id_1 = X
              evdev_mapping_1 = my_mapping.cfg

       If your version of flycast is compiled against X11, you might want to
       disable the built-in X11 keyboard support as this can interfere if your
       controller is detected as a keyboard:

              [input]
              enable_x11_keyboard = -1

GENERAL OPTIONS
       -config section:option=value
              Temporarily override a value of the config file.


       [IMAGE FILE]
              Load a specific image file.

              Although Flycast supports images in GDI, CHD, CUE and CDI
              format, you should avoid CDI images since they often have
              issues.

              If no image is given on the command line, flycast will display
              the list of available content.
