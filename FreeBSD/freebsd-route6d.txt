NAME
     route6d – RIP6 Routing Daemon

SYNOPSIS
     route6d [-adDhlnqsS] [-R routelog] [-A prefix/preflen,if1[,if2...]]
             [-L prefix/preflen,if1[,if2...]] [-N if1[,if2...]]
             [-O prefix/preflen,if1[,if2...]] [-P number] [-p pidfile]
             [-Q number] [-T if1[,if2...]] [-t tag]

DESCRIPTION
     The route6d utility is a routing daemon which supports RIP over IPv6.

     Options are:

     -a      Enables aging of the statically defined routes.  With this
             option, any statically defined routes will be removed unless
             corresponding updates arrive as if the routes are received at the
             startup of route6d.

     -R routelog
             This option makes the route6d to log the route change
             (add/delete) to the file routelog.

     -A prefix/preflen,if1[,if2...]
             This option is used for aggregating routes.  prefix/preflen
             specifies the prefix and the prefix length of the aggregated
             route.  When advertising routes, route6d filters specific routes
             covered by the aggregate, and advertises the aggregated route
             prefix/preflen, to the interfaces specified in the comma-
             separated interface list, if1[,if2...].  The characters "*", "?",
             and "[" in the interface list will be interpreted as shell-style
             pattern.  The route6d utility creates a static route to
             prefix/preflen with RTF_REJECT flag, into the kernel routing
             table.

     -d      Enables output of debugging message.  This option also instructs
             route6d to run in foreground mode (does not become daemon).

     -D      Enables extensive output of debugging message.  This option also
             instructs route6d to run in foreground mode (does not become
             daemon).

     -h      Disables the split horizon processing.

     -l      By default, route6d will not exchange site local routes for
             safety reasons.  This is because semantics of site local address
             space is rather vague (specification is still in being worked),
             and there is no good way to define site local boundary.  With -l
             option, route6d will exchange site local routes as well.  It must
             not be used on site boundary routers, since -l option assumes
             that all interfaces are in the same site.

     -L prefix/preflen,if1[,if2...]
             Filter incoming routes from interfaces if1,[if2...].  The route6d
             utility will accept incoming routes that are in prefix/preflen.
             If multiple -L options are specified, any routes that match one
             of the options is accepted.  ::/0 is treated specially as default
             route, not “any route that has longer prefix length than, or
             equal to 0”.  If you would like to accept any route, specify no
             -L option.  For example, with “-L 2001:db8::/16,if1 -L ::/0,if1”
             route6d will accept default route and routes in 6bone test
             address, but no others.

     -n      Do not update the kernel routing table.

     -N if1[,if2...]
             Do not listen to, or advertise, route from/to interfaces
             specified by if1,[if2...].

     -O prefix/preflen,if1[,if2...]
             Restrict route advertisement toward interfaces specified by
             if1,[if2...].  With this option route6d will only advertise
             routes that matches prefix/preflen.

     -P number
             Specifies routes to be ignored in calculation of expiration
             timer.  The number must be 1, 2, or 3 and it means route flags of
             RTF_PROTO1, RTF_PROTO2, or RTF_PROTO3.  When 1 is specified,
             routes with RTF_PROTO1 will never expire.

     -p pidfile
             Specifies an alternative file in which to store the process ID.
             The default is /var/run/route6d.pid.

     -Q number
             Specifies flag which will be used for routes added by RIP
             protocol.  The default is 2 (RTF_PROTO2).

     -q      Makes route6d in listen-only mode.  No advertisement is sent.

     -s      Makes route6d to advertise the statically defined routes which
             exist in the kernel routing table when route6d invoked.
             Announcements obey the regular split horizon rule.

     -S      This option is the same as -s option except that no split horizon
             rule does apply.

     -T if1[,if2...]
             Advertise only default route, toward if1,[if2...].

     -t tag  Attach route tag tag to originated route entries.  tag can be
             decimal, octal prefixed by 0, or hexadecimal prefixed by 0x.

     Upon receipt of signal SIGINT or SIGUSR1, route6d will dump the current
     internal state into /var/run/route6d_dump.

FILES
     /var/run/route6d_dump  dumps internal state on SIGINT or SIGUSR1

NOTE
     The route6d utility uses IPv6 advanced API, defined in RFC2292, for
     communicating with peers using link-local addresses.

     Internally route6d embeds interface identifier into bit 32 to 63 of link-
     local addresses (fe80::xx and ff02::xx) so they will be visible on
     internal state dump file (/var/run/route6d_dump).

     Routing table manipulation differs from IPv6 implementation to
     implementation.  Currently route6d obeys WIDE Hydrangea/KAME IPv6 kernel,
     and will not be able to run on other platforms.

     Current route6d does not reduce the rate of the triggered updates when
     consecutive updates arrive.
