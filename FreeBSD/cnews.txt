CHECKNEWS(1CN)                                                  CHECKNEWS(1CN)

NAME
       checknews - check for unread news

SYNOPSIS
       checknews

DESCRIPTION
       Checknews informs the user whether he has unread news.  It is suitable
       for running from a .profile (or .login if you use a certain non-
       standard shell) file.

       Checknews normally runs readnews(1) with the -c option.  As a heuristic
       concession to practicality, if the user has a .rnlast file in his $HOME
       directory, checknews runs rn -c -s3 instead.

FILES
       $HOME/.newsrc
       /var/lib/news/active

SEE ALSO

       own idiosyncratic approaches to this issue.
