FDIM(3)                FreeBSD Library Functions Manual                FDIM(3)

NAME
     fdim, fdimf, fdiml – positive difference functions

LIBRARY
     Math Library (libm, -lm)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <math.h>

     double
     fdim(double x, double y);

     float
     fdimf(float x, float y);

     long double
     fdiml(long double x, long double y);

DESCRIPTION
     The fdim(), fdimf(), and fdiml() functions return the positive difference
     between x and y.  That is, if x-y is positive, then x-y is returned.  If
     either x or y is an NaN, then an NaN is returned.  Otherwise, the result
     is +0.0.

     Overflow or underflow may occur if the exact result is not representable
     in the return type.  No other exceptions are raised.

SEE ALSO
     fabs(3), fmax(3), fmin(3), math(3)

STANDARDS
     The fdim(), fdimf(), and fdiml() functions conform to ISO/IEC 9899:1999
     (“ISO C99”).

HISTORY
     These routines first appeared in FreeBSD 5.3.
