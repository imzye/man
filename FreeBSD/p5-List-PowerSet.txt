NAME
       List::PowerSet - generate the power set of a list

SYNOPSIS
         use List::PowerSet qw(powerset powerset_lazy);

         my $ps = powerset(qw(1 2 3));

         my $ps_iterator = powerset_lazy(1 .. 1_000);
         while(my $set = $ps_iterator->()) {
             # $set is the next powerset entry
         }

DESCRIPTION
       Suppose you have a list L. The power set of such a list is a list of
       all the sublists that you can obtain from L by deleting elements from
       it.  For example, the power set of (1, 2, 3) is the list of lists ((),
       (1), (2), (3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (1, 2, 3)), in some order.

       "List::PowerSet" provides two functions (which are not exported by
       default, you have to ask for them) to generate power sets.

FUNCTIONS
   powerset()
       Given a list, powerset() returns an array reference of array
       references, each referring to a different subset in the powerset of the
       input list.

         my $ps = powerset(qw(1 2 3));

         # $ps == [ [1, 2, 3],
         #          [   2, 3],
         #          [1,    3],
         #          [      3],
         #          [1, 2   ],
         #          [   2   ],
         #          [1      ],
         #          [       ] ];

   powerset_lazy()
       Given even a moderately sized input list, powerset() will have to
       generate a huge result list, taking time and memory to generate.  A 20
       element input list to powerset() will generate a result list containing
       1,048,576 references to other arrays, on average containing 10 items.

       powerset_lazy() takes the same input list as powerset(), and returns a
       subroutine reference.  Every time you call through this reference an
       array reference to a different subset of the powerset is generated and
       returned.

       The original code was written by Mark.

       The module was written by Nik, who discovered mjd's code after failing
       to find a powerset implementation on CPAN.  With mjd's permission he
       packaged it so that others can easily make use of it.
