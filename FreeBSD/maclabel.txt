MACLABEL(7)        FreeBSD Miscellaneous Information Manual        MACLABEL(7)

NAME
     maclabel – Mandatory Access Control label format

DESCRIPTION
     If Mandatory Access Control, or MAC, is enabled in the kernel, then in
     addition to the traditional credentials, each subject (typically a user
     or a socket) and object (file system object, socket, etc.) is given a MAC
     label.  The MAC label specifies the necessary subject-specific or object-
     specific information necessary for a MAC security policy to enforce
     access control on the subject/object.

     The format for a MAC label is defined as follows:

           policy1/qualifier1,policy2/qualifier2,...

     A MAC label consists of a policy name, followed by a forward slash,
     followed by the subject or object's qualifier, optionally followed by a
     comma and one or more additional policy labels.  For example:

           biba/low(low-low)
           biba/high(low-high),mls/equal(equal-equal),partition/0
