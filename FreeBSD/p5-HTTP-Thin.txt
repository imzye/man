NAME
       HTTP::Thin - A Thin Wrapper around HTTP::Tiny to play nice with
       HTTP::Message

VERSION
       version 0.006

SYNOPSIS
           use 5.12.1;
           use HTTP::Request::Common;
           use HTTP::Thin;

           say HTTP::Thin->new()->request(GET 'http://example.com')->as_string;

DESCRIPTION
       WARNING: This module is untested beyond the very basics. The
       implementation is simple enough that it shouldn't do evil things but,
       yeah it's still not approved for use by small children.

       "HTTP::Thin" is a thin wrapper around HTTP::Tiny adding the ability to
       pass in HTTP::Request objects and get back HTTP::Response objects. The
       maintainers of HTTP::Tiny, justifiably, don't want to have to maintain
       compatibility but many other projects already consume the HTTP::Message
       objects. This is just glue code doing what it does best.

METHODS
   request
       In addition to the parameters documented in HTTP::Tiny, "HTTP::Thin"
       takes HTTP::Request objects as well.

       The return value is an HTTP::Response object.

WHY?
       A conversation on IRC lead to "mst", "ether", and I agreeing that this
       would be a useful module but probably not worth the effort. I wrote it
       anyway to get it out of my head.
