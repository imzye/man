SEND(4)                FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                SEND(4)

NAME
     send – Kernel side support for Secure Neighbor Discovery (SeND)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/socket.h>
     #include <netinet/in.h>
     #include <netinet6/send.h>

     int
     socket(PF_INET6, SOCK_RAW, IPPROTO_SEND);

     To load the driver as a module at boot time, place the following line in
     loader.conf(5):

           send_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     IPv6 nodes use the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) to discover other
     nodes on the link, to determine their link-layer addresses to find
     routers, and to maintain reachability information about the paths to
     active members.  NDP is vulnerable to various attacks [RFC3756].  Secure
     Neighbor Discovery is a set of extensions to NDP that counter threats to
     NDP [RFC3971].

     Kernel side support for SeND consists of a kernel module with hooks that
     divert relevant packets (Neighbor Solicitations, Neighbor Advertisements,
     Router Solicitations, Router Advertisements and Redirects) from the NDP
     stack, send them to user space on a dedicated socket and reinject them
     back for further processing.  Hooks are triggered only if the send module
     is loaded.

     The native SeND socket is similar to a raw IP socket, but with its own,
     internal pseudo-protocol (IPPROTO_SEND).  Struct sockaddr_send is defined
     in <netinet6/send.h>.  It defines the total length of the structure, the
     address family, packet's incoming or outgoing direction from the
     interface's point of view, and the interface index.

     struct sockaddr_send {
             unsigned char           send_len;       /* total length */
             sa_family_t             send_family;    /* address family */
             int                     send_direction;
             int                     send_ifidx;
             char                    send_zero[8];
     };

     The address family is always AF_INET6.  The send_direction variable
     denotes the direction of the packet from the interface's point of view
     and has either the value SND_IN or SND_OUT.  The send_ifidx variable is
     the interface index of the receiving or sending interface.  The send_zero
     variable is padding and must always be zero.

     In case that no user space application is connected to the send socket,
     processing continues normally as if the module was not loaded.

INPUT HOOK
     The input hook is named after the input path of the incoming or outgoing
     NDP packets, on the way from the wire, through the nd6 stack, to user
     space.  Relevant packets are identified by adding an mbuf_tag (see
     mbuf_tags(9)) to the mbuf(9), if the send module is loaded.  It is then
     passed on to the kernel-userland interface for either cryptographic
     protection or validation by the SeND application.  The hook takes an
     argument that describes the direction of the packet, both in case of
     incoming and outgoing packets.  SND_IN is the direction of the incoming
     packets that are usually protected by the SeND options and then sent to
     user space for cryptographic validation.  SND_OUT is the outgoing
     direction.  It describes both reply and locally originated outgoing
     packets that are sent to user space for the addition of SeND options.

INCOMING PACKETS

ERRORS
     A socket operation may fail with one of the following errors returned:

     [EEXIST]           Another user space SeND application is bound to the
                        socket.

     [ENOBUFS]          Shortage of space to receive the incoming (SeND-
                        protected) or outgoing (SeND-validated) packet from
                        the SeND application.

     [ENOSYS]           A packet received from user space and passed to the
                        NDP stack for further processing is neither Neighbor
                        Solicitation, Neighbor Advertisement, Router
                        Solicitation, Router Advertisement nor Redirect.

     [ENOENT]           Occurs if interface output routines fail to send the
                        packet out of the interface.

BUGS
     Due to the lack of NDP locking, it is currently not possible to unload
     the send module.
