AUTORESPOND(1)          FreeBSD General Commands Manual         AUTORESPOND(1)

NAME
     autorespond – simple autoresponder for qmail

SYNOPSIS
     autorespond time num message dir

DESCRIPTION
     This manual page documents briefly the autorespond command.  This manual
     page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the
     original program does not have a manual page.

     autorespond sends an automatically generated response to emails for given
     address(es).  It catches simple situations such as mail from a mailer-
     daemon, empty envelope sender, bulk precedence headers, etc.

     time    amount of time to consider a message (in secs)

     num     maximum number of messages to allow within time secs

     message
             the filename of the message to send

     dir     the directory to hold the log of messages

AUTHOR
     This manual page was written by Sam Johnston ⟨samj@debian.org⟩, for the
     Debian GNU/Linux system (but may be used by others).  It was converted to
     mdoc(7) format by Peter Pentchev ⟨roam@FreeBSD.org⟩ for use by the
     FreeBSD port of autorespond.
