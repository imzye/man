PROCMAP(8)              FreeBSD System Manager's Manual             PROCMAP(8)

NAME
     procmap – print a procfs map file

SYNOPSIS
     procmap <pid>
     procmap curproc

DESCRIPTION
     The procmap utility prints the full contents of a procfs map file.  Using
     a program such as cat is unreliable for this purpose, since the kernel
     must be able to write the entire contents at once, which requires a
     sufficiently large buffer.

FILES
     /proc/*/map
