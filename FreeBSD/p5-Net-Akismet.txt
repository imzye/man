                               URL => 'http://example.blog.net/',
                       ) or die('Key verification failure!');

               my $verdict = $akismet->check(
                               USER_IP                         => '10.10.10.11',
                               COMMENT_USER_AGENT      => 'Mozilla/5.0',
                               COMMENT_CONTENT         => 'Run, Lola, Run, the spam will catch you!',
                               COMMENT_AUTHOR          => 'dosser',
                               COMMENT_AUTHOR_EMAIL    => 'dosser@subway.de',
                               REFERRER                => 'http://lola.home/',
                       ) or die('Is the server here?');

               if ('true' eq $verdict) {

                       print "I found spam. I am a spam-founder!\n";
               }

METHODS
       new()
                       Net::Akismet->new(PARAM => ...);

               Acceptable parameters:

               KEY The API key being verified for use with the API.

               URL The front page or home URL of the instance making the
                   request.  For a blog or wiki this would be the front page.

               USER_AGENT
                   If supplied the value is prepended to this module's
                   identification string to become something like:

                           your-killer-app/0.042 Perl-Net-Akismet/0.01 libwww-perl/5.8

                   Otherwise just Akismet Perl's user agent string will be
                   sent.

               SERVICE_HOST
                   If supplied, the host of the service API. The default is
                   rest.akismet.com

               SERVICE_VERSION
                   If supplied, the API version. The default is 1.1

               If verification of the key was unsuccessful new() returns
               "undef".

       check()
                       $akismet->check(USER_IP => ..., COMMENT_CONTENT => ..., ...)

               To be or not to be... "check" is meant to tell you.  Give it
               enough details about the comment and expect 'true', 'false' or
               "undef" as a result.  'true' means spam, 'false' means not
               spam, "undef" is returned on errror in submission of the
               comment.

               Acceptable comment characteristics:

               USER_IP
                   Required.  Represents the IP address of the comment
                   submitter.

               COMMENT_USER_AGENT
                   Required.  User agent string from the comment submitter's
                   request.

               COMMENT_CONTENT
                   Comment text.

               REFERRER
                   HTTP "Referer" header.

               PERMALINK
                   Permanent link to the subject of the comment.

               COMMENT_TYPE
                   May be blank, 'comment', 'trackback', 'pingback', or a made
                   up value like 'registration'.

               COMMENT_AUTHOR
                   Name of submitter.

               COMMENT_AUTHOR_EMAIL
                   Submitter e-mail.

               COMMENT_AUTHOR_URL
                   Submitter web page.

       spam()  Reports a certain comment as spam.  Accepts the same arguments
               as check().

               In case of failed submission returns "undef", otherwise - a
               perl-known truth.

       ham()   This call is intended for the marking of false positives,
               things that were incorrectly marked as spam.  It takes
               identical arguments as check() and spam().

               In case of failed submission returns "undef", otherwise - a
               perl-known truth.

NOTES
       Although almost all comment characteristics are optional, performance
       can drop dramatically if you exclude certain elements.  So please,
       supply as much comment detail as possible.
