KYUA-DEBUG(1)           FreeBSD General Commands Manual          KYUA-DEBUG(1)

NAME
     kyua debug – Executes a single test case with facilities for debugging

SYNOPSIS
     kyua debug [--build-root path] [--kyuafile file] [--stdout path]
                [--stderr path] test_case

DESCRIPTION
     The kyua debug command provides a mechanism to execute a single test case
     bypassing some of the Kyua infrastructure and allowing the user to poke
     into the execution behavior of the test.

     The test case to run is selected by providing a test filter, described
     below in Test filters, that matches a single test case.  The test case is
     executed and its result is printed as the last line of the output of the
     tool.

     The test executed by kyua debug is run under a controlled environment as
     described in Test isolation.

     At the moment, the kyua debug command allows the following aspects of a
     test case execution to be tweaked:

     •   Redirection of the test case's stdout and stderr to the console (the
         default) or to arbitrary files.  See the --stdout and --stderr
         options below.

     The following subcommand options are recognized:

     --build-root path
         Specifies the build root in which to find the test programs
         referenced by the Kyuafile, if different from the Kyuafile's
         directory.  See Build directories below for more information.

     --kyuafile file, -k file
         Specifies the Kyuafile to process.  Defaults to Kyuafile file in the
         current directory.

     --stderr path
         Specifies the file to which to send the standard error of the test
         program's body.  The default is /dev/stderr, which is a special
         character device that redirects the output to standard error on the
         console.

     --stdout path
         Specifies the file to which to send the standard output of the test
         program's body.  The default is /dev/stdout, which is a special
         character device that redirects the output to standard output on the
         console.

     For example, consider the following Kyua session:

           $ kyua test
           kernel/fs:mkdir  ->  passed
           kernel/fs:rmdir  ->  failed: Invalid argument

           1/2 passed (1 failed)

     At this point, we do not have a lot of information regarding the failure
     of the ‘kernel/fs:rmdir’ test.  We can run this test through the kyua
     debug command to inspect its output a bit closer, hoping that the test
     case is kind enough to log its progress:

           $ kyua debug kernel/fs:rmdir
           Trying rmdir('foo')
           Trying rmdir(NULL)
           kernel/fs:rmdir  ->  failed: Invalid argument

     Luckily, the offending test case was printing status lines as it
     progressed, so we could see the last attempted call and we can know match
     the failure message to the problem.

   Build directories
     Build directories (or object directories, target directories, product
     directories, etc.) is the concept that allows a developer to keep the
     source tree clean from build products by asking the build system to place
     such build products under a separate subtree.

     Most build systems today support build directories.  For example, the GNU
     Automake/Autoconf build system exposes such concept when invoked as
     follows:

           $ cd my-project-1.0
           $ mkdir build
           $ cd build
           $ ../configure
           $ make

     Under such invocation, all the results of the build are left in the
     my-project-1.0/build/ subdirectory while maintaining the contents of
     my-project-1.0/ intact.

     Because build directories are an integral part of most build systems, and
     because they are a tool that developers use frequently, kyua debug
     supports build directories too.  This manifests in the form of kyua debug
     being able to run tests from build directories while reading the (often
     immutable) test suite definition from the source tree.

     One important property of build directories is that they follow (or need
     to follow) the exact same layout as the source tree.  For example,
     consider the following directory listings:

           src/Kyuafile
           src/bin/ls/
           src/bin/ls/Kyuafile
           src/bin/ls/ls.c
           src/bin/ls/ls_test.c
           src/sbin/su/
           src/sbin/su/Kyuafile
           src/sbin/su/su.c
           src/sbin/su/su_test.c

           obj/bin/ls/
           obj/bin/ls/ls*
           obj/bin/ls/ls_test*
           obj/sbin/su/
           obj/sbin/su/su*
           obj/sbin/su/su_test*

     Note how the directory layout within src/ matches that of obj/.  The src/
     directory contains only source files and the definition of the test suite
     (the Kyuafiles), while the obj/ directory contains only the binaries
     generated during a build.

     All commands that deal with the workspace support the --build-root path
     option.  When this option is provided, the directory specified by the
     option is considered to be the root of the build directory.  For example,
     considering our previous fake tree layout, we could invoke kyua debug as
     any of the following:

           $ kyua debug --kyuafile=src/Kyuafile --build-root=obj
           $ cd src && kyua debug --build-root=../obj

   Test filters
     A test filter is a string that is used to match test cases or test
     programs in a test suite.  Filters have the following form:

           test_program_name[:test_case_name]

     Where ‘test_program_name’ is the name of a test program or a subdirectory
     in the test suite, and ‘test_case_name’ is the name of a test case.

   Test isolation
     The test programs and test cases run by kyua debug are all executed in a
     deterministic environment.  This known, clean environment serves to make
     the test execution as reproducible as possible and also to prevent
     clashes between tests that may, for example, create auxiliary files with
     overlapping names.

     For plain test programs and for TAP test programs, the whole test program
     is run under a single instance of the environment described in this page.
     For ATF test programs (see atf(7)), each individual test case and test
     cleanup routine are executed in separate environments.

     Process space
         Each test is executed in an independent processes.  Corollary: the
         test can do whatever it wants to the current process (such as modify
         global variables) without having to undo such changes.

     Session and process group
         The test is executed in its own session and its own process group.
         There is no controlling terminal attached to the session.

         Should the test spawn any children, the children should maintain the
         same session and process group.  Modifying any of these settings
         prevents kyua debug from being able to kill any stray subprocess as
         part of the cleanup phase.  If modifying these settings is necessary,
         or if any subprocess started by the test decides to use a different
         process group or session, it is the responsibility of the test to
         ensure those subprocesses are forcibly terminated during cleanup.

     Work directory
         The test is executed in a temporary directory automatically created
         by the runtime engine.  Corollary: the test can write to its current
         directory without needing to clean any files and/or directories it
         creates.  The runtime engine takes care to recursively delete the
         temporary directories after the execution of a test case.  Any file
         systems mounted within the temporary directory are also unmounted.

     Home directory
         The HOME environment variable is set to the absolute path of the work
         directory.

     Umask
         The value of the umask is set to 0022.

     Environment
         The LANG, LC_ALL, LC_COLLATE, LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, LC_MONETARY,
         LC_NUMERIC and LC_TIME variables are unset.

         The TZ variable is set to ‘UTC’.

         The TMPDIR variable is set to the absolute path of the work
         directory.  This is to prevent the test from mistakenly using a
         temporary directory outside of the automatically-managed work
         directory, should the test use the mktemp(3) familiy of functions.

     Process limits
         The maximum soft core size limit is raised to its corresponding hard
         limit.  This is a simple, best-effort attempt at allowing tests to
         dump core for further diagnostic purposes.

     Configuration varibles
         The test engine may pass run-time configuration variables to the test
         program via the environment.  The name of the configuration variable
         is prefixed with ‘TEST_ENV_’ so that a configuration variable of the
         form ‘foo=bar’ becomes accessible in the environment as
         ‘TEST_ENV_foo=bar’.

EXIT STATUS
     The kyua debug command returns 0 if the test case passes or 1 if the test
     case fails.

     Additional exit codes may be returned as described in kyua(1).
