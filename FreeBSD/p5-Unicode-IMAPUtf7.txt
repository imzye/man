NAME
       Unicode::IMAPUtf7 - Perl extension to deal with IMAP UTF7

SYNOPSIS
         use Unicode::IMAPUtf7;

         my $t = Unicode::IMAPUtf7->new();
         print $t->encode('Répertoire');
         print $t->decode('R&AOk-pertoire');

       **DEPRECATED**

         print Unicode::IMAPUtf7::imap_utf7_encode('R�pertoire');
         print Unicode::IMAPUtf7::imap_utf7_decode('R&AOk-pertoire');

       **DEPRECATED**

DESCRIPTION
       IMAP mailbox names are encoded in a modified UTF7 when names contains
       international characters outside of the printable ASCII range. The
       modified UTF-7 encoding is defined in RFC2060 (section 5.1.3).

METHODS
       new()
           Returns a new instance of a Unicode::IMAPUtf7 object.

       encode($text)
           Returns the modified UTF7-text for a string in UTF8.

       decode($text)
           Returns the decoded string into UTF8 data.

DEPRECATED METHODS
       imap_utf7_encode: returns the modified UTF7-text for a string in
       Latin1.

       imap_utf7_decode: returns the decoded string into Latin1 data.

       These functions may disappear in some later version.  Please update
       with the new OO and UTF8 scheme. See Unicode::String for conversion
       functions between Latin1 and UTF8.

RFC2060 - section 5.1.3 - Mailbox International Naming Convention
       By convention, international mailbox names are specified using a
       modified version of the UTF-7 encoding described in [UTF-7].  The
       purpose of these modifications is to correct the following problems
       with UTF-7:

       1) UTF-7 uses the "+" character for shifting; this conflicts with
          the common use of "+" in mailbox names, in particular USENET
          newsgroup names.

       2) UTF-7's encoding is BASE64 which uses the "/" character; this
          conflicts with the use of "/" as a popular hierarchy delimiter.

       3) UTF-7 prohibits the unencoded usage of "\"; this conflicts with
          the use of "\" as a popular hierarchy delimiter.

       4) UTF-7 prohibits the unencoded usage of "~"; this conflicts with
          the use of "~" in some servers as a home directory indicator.

       5) UTF-7 permits multiple alternate forms to represent the same
          string; in particular, printable US-ASCII chararacters can be
          represented in encoded form.

       In modified UTF-7, printable US-ASCII characters except for "&"
       represent themselves; that is, characters with octet values 0x20-0x25
       and 0x27-0x7e.  The character "&" (0x26) is represented by the two-
       octet sequence "&-".

       All other characters (octet values 0x00-0x1f, 0x7f-0xff, and all
       Unicode 16-bit octets) are represented in modified BASE64, with a
       further modification from [UTF-7] that "," is used instead of "/".
       Modified BASE64 MUST NOT be used to represent any printing US-ASCII
       character which can represent itself.

       "&" is used to shift to modified BASE64 and "-" to shift back to US-
       ASCII.  All names start in US-ASCII, and MUST end in US-ASCII (that is,
       a name that ends with a Unicode 16-bit octet MUST end with a "- ").

       For example, here is a mailbox name which mixes English, Japanese, and
       Chinese text: ~peter/mail/&ZeVnLIqe-/&U,BTFw-
