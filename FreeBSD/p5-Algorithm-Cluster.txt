NAME
       Algorithm::Cluster - Perl interface to the C Clustering Library.

DESCRIPTION
       This module is an interface to the C Clustering Library, a general
       purpose library implementing functions for hierarchical clustering
       (pairwise simple, complete, average, and centroid linkage), along with
       k-means and k-medians clustering, and 2D self-organizing maps.  This
       library was developed at the Human Genome Center of the University of
       Tokyo. The C Clustering Library is distributed along with Cluster 3.0,
       an enhanced version of the famous Cluster program originally written by
       Michael Eisen while at Stanford University.

EXAMPLES
       See the scripts in the examples subdirectory of the package.

CHANGES
       •   C Clustering Library version 1.59
