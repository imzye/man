NAME
       Astro::Constants - This library provides physical constants for use in
       Physics and Astronomy based on values from CODATA2014.

VERSION
       version 0.14

SYNOPSIS
           use strict;         # important!
           use Astro::Constants::MKS qw/:long/;

           # to calculate the gravitational force of the Sun on the Earth in Newtons, use GMm/r^2
           my $force_sun_earth = GRAVITATIONAL * MASS_SOLAR * MASS_EARTH / ASTRONOMICAL_UNIT**2;

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides physical and mathematical constants for use in
       Astronomy and Astrophysics.

       The ":long" tag imports all the constants in their long name forms
       (i.e. GRAVITATIONAL).  Useful subsets can be imported with these tags:
       ":fundamental" ":conversion" ":mathematics" ":cosmology" ":planetary"
       ":electromagnetic" or ":nuclear".  Alternate names such as LIGHT_SPEED
       instead of SPEED_LIGHT or HBAR instead of H_BAR are imported with
       ":alternates".  I'd like to move away from their use, but they have
       been in the module for years.  Short forms of the constant names are
       included to provide backwards compatibility with older versions based
       on Jeremy Bailin's Astroconst library and are available through the
       import tag ":short".

       The values are stored in Physical_Constants.xml in the data directory
       and are mostly based on the 2014 CODATA values from NIST.

       Long name constants are constructed with the constant pragma and are
       not interpolated in double quotish situations because they are really
       inlined functions.  Short name constants are constructed with the age-
       old idiom of fiddling with the symbol table using typeglobs, e.g. "*PI
       = \3.14159", and may be slower than the long name constants.

   Why use this module
       You are tired of typing in all those numbers and having to make sure
       that they are all correct.  How many significant figures is enough or
       too much?  Where's the definitive source, Wikipedia?  And which mass
       does "$m1" refer to, solar or lunar?

       The constant values in this module are protected against accidental re-
       assignment in your code.  The test suite protects them against
       accidental finger trouble in my code.  Other people are using this
       module, so more eyeballs are looking for errors and we all benefit.
       The constant names are a little longer than you might like, but you
       gain in the long run from readable, sharable code that is clear in
       meaning.  Your programming errors are a little easier to find when you
       can see that the units don't match.  Isn't it reassuring that you can
       verify how a number is produced and which meeting of which standards
       body is responsible for its value?

       Trusting someone else's code does carry some risk, which you should
       consider, but have you also considered the risk of doing it yourself
       with no one else to check your work?

       And plus, it's FASTER

       Benchmarking has shown that the imported constants can be more than 3
       times faster than using variables or other constant modules because of
       the way the compiler optimizes your code.  So, if you've got a lot of
       calculating to do, this is the module to do it with.

   pretty
       This is a helper function that rounds a value or list of values to 5
       significant figures.

   precision
       Give this method the string of the constant and it returns the
       precision or uncertainty listed.

         $rel_precision = precision('GRAVITATIONAL');
         $abs_precision = precision('MASS_EARTH');

       At the moment you need to know whether the uncertainty is relative or
       absolute.  Looking to fix this in future versions.

EXPORT
       Nothing is exported by default, so the module doesn't clobber any of
       your variables.  Select from the following tags:

       •   ":long"                (use this one to get the most constants)

       •   ":short"

       •   ":fundamental"

       •   ":conversion"

       •   ":mathematics"

       •   ":cosmology"

       •   ":planetary"

       •   ":electromagnetic"

       •   ":nuclear"

       •   ":alternates"

   Deprecated functions
       I've gotten rid of "list_constants" and "describe_constants" because
       they are now in the documentation.  Use "perldoc Astro::Constants" for
       that information.

       Using "strict" is a must with this code.  Any constants you forgot to
       import will evaluate to 0 and silently introduce errors in your code.

       If you are using this module, drop me a line using any available means
       at your disposal, including *gasp* email (address in the Author
       section), to let me know how you're using it.  What new features would
       you like to see?  If you've had an experience with using the module,
       let other people know what you think, good or bad, by rating it at
       cpanratings <http://cpanratings.perl.org/rate/?distribution=Astro-
       Constants>.

   Extending the data set
       If you want to add in your own constants or override the factory
       defaults, run make, edit the PhysicalConstants.xml file and then run
       "dzil build" again.  If you have a pre-existing PhysicalConstants.xml
       file, drop it in place before running "dzil build".

   Availability
       the original astroconst sites have disappeared

ROADMAP
       I plan to deprecate the short names and change the order in which long
       names are constructed, moving to a noun_adjective format.  LIGHT_SPEED
       and SOLAR_MASS become SPEED_LIGHT and MASS_SOLAR.  This principle
       should make the code easier to read with the most important information
       coming at the beginning of the name.

ASTROCONST
       (Gleaned from the Astroconst home page - astroconst.org
       <http://web.astroconst.org> )

       Astroconst is a set of header files in various languages (currently C,
       Fortran, Perl, Java, IDL and Gnuplot) that provide a variety of useful
       astrophysical constants without constantly needing to look them up.

       The generation of the header files from one data file is automated, so
       you can add new constants to the data file and generate new header
       files in all the appropriate languages without needing to fiddle with
       each header file individually.

       This package was created and is maintained by Jeremy Bailin.  It's
       license states that it is completely free, both as in speech and as in
       beer.

DISCLAIMER
       No warranty expressed or implied.  This is free software.  If you want
       someone to assume the risk of an incorrect value, you better be paying
       them.

       (What would you want me to test in order for you to depend on this
       module?)

       from Jeremy Bailin's astroconst header files

       The Astroconst values have been gleaned from a variety of sources, and
       have quite different precisions depending both on the known precision
       of the value in question, and in some cases on the precision of the
       source I found it from. These values are not guaranteed to be correct.
       Astroconst is not certified for any use whatsoever. If your rocket
       crashes because the precision of the lunar orbital eccentricity isn't
       high enough, that's too bad.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
       Jeremy Balin, for writing the astroconst package and helping test and
       develop this module.

       Doug Burke, for giving me the idea to write this module in the first
       place, tidying up Makefile.PL, testing and improving the documentation.
