NAME
     ubsa – USB support for Belkin serial adapters

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device usb
           device ucom
           device ubsa

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           ubsa_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The ubsa driver provides support for the USB-to-RS232 Bridge chip used by
     a variety of serial adapters from Belkin and other vendors.

     The device is accessed through the ucom(4) driver which makes it behave
     like a tty(4).

HARDWARE
     The ubsa driver supports the following adapters:

     •   AnyData ADU-500A EV-DO modem
     •   AnyData ADU-E100A (no EV-DO mode support)
     •   Belkin F5U103
     •   Belkin F5U120
     •   e-Tek Labs Kwik232
     •   GoHubs GoCOM232
     •   Peracom single port serial adapter
