NAME
       REST::Google - access Google REST (aka AJAX) API from Perl

SYNOPSIS
               use REST::Google;

               # set service to use
               REST::Google->service('http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/services/search/web');

               # provide a valid http referer
               REST::Google->http_referer('http://example.com');

               my $res = REST::Google->new(
                       q => 'Larry Wall',
               );

               die "response status failure" if $res->responseStatus != 200;

               my $data = $res->responseData;

               use Data::Dumper;
               print Dumper( $data );

DESCRIPTION
       "REST::Google" provides OO interface to Google REST (aka AJAX) API.

       Note that this module provides low-level access to Google services API.
       Consider using REST::Google::Search, REST::Google::Translate or
       REST::Google::Feeds, which provide convenient access to service request
       results.

METHODS
       __PACKAGE__->service()
           Get/set service to use. You must set this to valid URL. E.g.:

                   REST::Google->service('http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/services/search/web');

           Normally, you don't need this, since REST::Google::Search,
           REST::Google::Translate or REST::Google::Feeds modules do this for
           you.

       __PACKAGE__->http_referer()
           Get/set HTTP "Referer" header.

                   REST::Google->http_referer('http://example.org/search.html');

           Note: Google says that you should supply a valid HTTP referer
           header each time you perform a request to their AJAX API, so new()
           raises warning unless referer is specified.

       __PACKAGE__->new()
           The constructor use it's arguments to build a valid HTTP GET
           request to given service, so it takes the same arguments as the
           given web service takes.  Please refer to 'Google AJAX API'
           documentation for complete list of arguments for a service you're
           using. E.g.:

                   my $res = REST::Google->new(
                           q => 'Pamela Anderson',
                   );

           For example, if you're using the Web search service, the code above
           will perform a following HTTP GET request:

                   http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/services/search/web?q=Pamela+Anderson&v=1.0

           Note: You can left protocol version number unspecified since
           "v=1.0" is passed by default.

           For service specific arguments, check Google API documentation
           pages in the SEE ALSO section.

           "REST::Google" object completely represents Google API response
           objects and has the following structure:

                   {
                           "responseData" => {},
                           "responseDetails" => undef | string-on-error,
                           "responseStatus" => 200 | error-code
                   }

       $res->responseStatus()
           The responseStatus property contains a value of 200 on success and
           a non-200 HTTP error status code on failure. If there is a failure,
           "responseDetails" contains a diagnostic string.

       $res->responseDetails()
           Contain an error string if "responseStatus" is not 200.

       $res->responseData()
           Returns a "responseData" structure.  Please refer to service API
           documentation for response structure details.

DEPENDENCIES
