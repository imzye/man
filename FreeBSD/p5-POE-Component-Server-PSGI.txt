POE::Component::Server::PSGI(3)            User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       POE::Component::Server::PSGI

VERSION
       version 0.6

DESCRIPTION
       PSGI Server implementation for POE.

NOTE
       We've switched over to using nperez's excellent POEx::Role::PSGIServer,
       since it's essentially a (much better) refactor of this module's
       original code.  Use this if you just want a default implementation of
       his role with no modifications.

SYNOPSIS
           use POE::Component::Server::PSGI;

           my $server = POE::Component::Server::PSGI->new(
               host => $host,
               port => $port,
           );
           $server->run($app);

INTERFACE
       See Plack::Server.
