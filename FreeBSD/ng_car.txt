NG_CAR(4)              FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual              NG_CAR(4)

NAME
     ng_car – Committed Access Rate netgraph node type

SYNOPSIS
     #include <netgraph/ng_car.h>

DESCRIPTION
     The car node type limits traffic flowing through it using:

     •   Single rate three color marker as described in RFC 2697,
     •   Two rate three color marker as described in RFC 2698,
     •   RED-like rate limit algorithm used by Cisco,
     •   Traffic shaping with RED.

HOOKS
     This node type supports the following hooks:

     upper      Hook leading to upper layer protocols.

     lower      Hook leading to lower layer protocols.

     Traffic flowing from upper to lower is considered downstream traffic.
     Traffic flowing from lower to upper is considered upstream traffic.

MODES OF OPERATION
     Each hook can operate in one of the following modes:

     NG_CAR_SINGLE_RATE
          Single rate three color marker as described in RFC 2697.  Committed
          burst packets are counted as green, extended burst packets are
          counted as yellow and exceeding packets are counted as red.
          Committed burst getting refilled with CIR (Committed Information
          Rate) speed.  When it is full, exceeded burst getting refilled.

     NG_CAR_DOUBLE_RATE
          Two rate three color marker as described in RFC 2698.  Committed
          burst packets are counted as green, peak burst packets are counted
          as yellow and exceeding packets are counted as red.  Committed burst
          getting refilled with CIR speed.  Peak burst getting refilled with
          PIR (Peak Information Rate) speed at the same time.

     NG_CAR_RED
          Similar to NG_CAR_SINGLE_RATE, but with different understanding of
          extended burst.  When normal burst exceeded and extended burst is
          used, packets are counted red with probability equal to part of
          extended burst consumed.  Extended burst getting refilled first.
          When it is full, committed burst getting refilled.  This behavior is
          similar to RED active queue management algorithm.

          This algorithm is more polite to the TCP traffic than
          NG_CAR_SINGLE_RATE.

     NG_CAR_SHAPE
          Committed burst packets are counted as green, exceeding packets are
          delayed by queue with RED management and counted as yellow.  Packets
          dropped by queue counted as red.  Queue parameters are hardcoded:
          length 99 packets, min_th 8 packets, max_p 100%.

          Traffic shaping is much more polite to the TCP traffic than rate
          limit on links with bandwidth * delay product less than 6-8 TCP
          segments, but it consumes additional system resources for queue
          processing.

     By default, all information rates are measured in bits per second and
     bursts are measured in bytes.  But when NG_CAR_COUNT_PACKETS option is
     enabled, rates are measured in packets per second and bursts are in
     packets.

CONTROL MESSAGES
     This node type supports the generic control messages and the following
     specific messages.

     NGM_CAR_GET_CONF (getconf)

     incoming packet rate to 5000pps.
