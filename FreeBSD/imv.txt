NAME
       imv-dir - Open 'imv' for all images in a directory

DESCRIPTION
       imv-dir is a wrapper for imv that auto-selects the directory where the
       image is located, so that the next and previous commands function in
       the same way as other image viewers.

       Note that this wrapper supports only a single image. For opening
       multiple images, use plain imv.

SYNOPSIS
       imv-dir path
