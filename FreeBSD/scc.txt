SCC(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 SCC(4)

NAME
     scc – driver for Serial Communications Controllers (SCC) devices

SYNOPSIS
     device scc
     device uart

DESCRIPTION
     The scc device driver provides support for various classes of SCCs.  It
     is an umbrella driver that delegates control of each independent
     communication channel to subordinate drivers.  These subordinate drivers,
     like uart(4), take care of the details of the communication itself.

HARDWARE
     The scc driver supports the following classes of SCCs:

     •   QUICC: Freescale/NXP QUad Integrated Communications Controllers.
     •   Z8530: Zilog 8530 based serial communications controllers.

SEE ALSO
     puc(4), uart(4)

HISTORY
     The scc device driver first appeared in FreeBSD 7.0.
