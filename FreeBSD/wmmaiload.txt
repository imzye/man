WMMAILOAD(1)            FreeBSD General Commands Manual           WMMAILOAD(1)



NAME
       wmmaiload - A dockapp to monitor mailboxes



SYNOPSIS
       wmmaiload [options]



DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the wmmaiload command.

       WMMaiLoad is a program to monitor mailboxes. It is a dockapp that is
       supported by X window managers such as Window Maker, AfterStep,
       BlackBox, and Enlightenment.

       The new mails number is displayed in the top half.  The total mails
       number is in the bottom half. It has an LCD look-alike user interface.
       The back-light may be turned on/off by clicking the mouse button 1
       (left) over the application. If there is new mail, an alarm-mode will
       alert you by turning on and off back-light. This can be stopped (and
       restarted) by clicking the mouse button 3 (right) over the application.
       An application can be launched with the mouse button 2 (middle) such as
       a mail user agent.  When clicking on the dockapp with button 2 and the
       control key pressed, it launches wmmaiload-config, the WMMaiLoad
       configuration tool (if it can be found in the PATH).  One can cycle
       through individual mail boxes by clicking on the "-" or "+" signs in
       the window (can display up to 99 mailbox numbers even if more can be
       put in the list). The "--" mailbox number is for displaying the global
       values. No cycle can be done if there's only one mailbox :) Using
       button 3 cycles mailboxes by 10.

       Command-line options override the default configuration file options
       (see FILE section below).

       There are 3 alarm modes. First when there is new mail either if the
       global mailbox is displayed or a mailbox that has no new mail is
       currently displayed, then the background blinks. Second, when there is
       new mail only in the mailbox that is currently displayed, then the new
       mails count blinks. Last, when there is new mail in the currently
       displayed mailbox and in another mailboxe, then the background and the
       new mails count blink.

       WMMaiLoad can monitor mbox-format files, MAILDIRS, MH, POP3, HOTMAIL
       and IMAP mailboxes...



OPTIONS
       This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax. A summary of
       options is included below.

       -h     show help text and exit.

       -v     show program version and exit.

       -w     run the application in windowed mode.

       -k     activate broken window manager fix.

       -b     turn on back-light.

       -s     disable blinking when there is new mail.

       -r     run command (see -n) only once : not each time new mail arrives,
              but only when new mails count change from 0 to not 0 :)

       -z     use files' size to check for new mails instead of time.

       -t     don't use threads for mail boxes checking.

       -d <string>
              Attempt to open a window on the named X display. If this option
              is not present, the display specified by the DISPLAY environment
              variable is used.

       -c <color>
              back-light color (rgb:6E/C6/3B is default).

       -x <string>
              command to launch with button 3.

       -n <string>
              command to launch each time there is new mail.

       -f     load configuration file.

       -i <number>
              number of secs between updates (1 is default).

       -o <number>
              display specified box infos directly (0 is the default for
              global counts).  This option should be put AFTER any addition to
              the mail box list in order to verify mailbox number validity.

       -l <number>
              delay in seconds between pop3/hotmail and imap checks.

       -m <string>
              use that mail box (may be used more than once -- see section
              FILE below).



FILE
       wmmaiload uses one default file : ~/.wmmailoadrc. Empty lines or lines
       begining with a # are ignored. Entries are summarized below (default
       value in parenthesis). Booleans can be either 1/0 or true/false or
       yes/no or on/off, case insensitive. A sample file is given in the
       source package.  The configuration entries are overwritten by command
       line arguments. But if configuration is changed via the graphical
       configuration tool in runtime, configuration options are then read from
       the file if it has been saved.

       Backlight =
              Boolean (off).

       Color =
              String (#6EC63B).

       Interval =
              Integer (1).

       Mailbox =
              String (noting). You can have several Mailbox entries. A mailbox
              is defined with a maximum of 5 space-separated fields : type,
              file-or-url, username, password and folder. Types are MBOX,
              POP3, MAILDIR, MH, HOTMAIL and IMAP.  For an MBOX, MH and
              MAILDIR mail boxes, the file-or-url field is the filename (or
              directory name) of the mbox file and other fields are not used.
              For POP3, HOTMAIL and IMAP boxes, the file-or-url field is the
              server url, other fields are used as normal. Note that in the
              latter case, you can use the standard server:port specification.
              The folder field is used for IMAP only.

       Command =
              String (nothing).

       Notify =
              String (nothing).

       Blink =
              Boolean (yes).

       DefaultBox =
              Integer (0).

       CheckDelay =
              Integer (30, min = 15).

       RunOnce =
              Boolean (False).

       CheckSize =
              Boolean (False). For mbox files : if False, check mbox mtime.

       UseThreads =
              Boolean (True). Use threads for mail boxes checking or not.



MAILBOXES
       Mail boxes are more willingly configured from within the configuration
       file for ease of use rather than from command line. A configuration
       option for a mail box is following the next scheme :

       Mailbox = TYPE FILE-OR-URL [USERNAME] [PASSWORD] [FOLDER]

       TYPE   must be one of MBOX, POP3, MAILDIR, MH, HOTMAIL and IMAP.

       FILE-OR-URL
              is where to get the mailbox data :
              - MBOX : the mailbox filename.
              - MAILDIR : the mailbox directory name
              - MH : the mailbox directory name
              - POP3 : the url of the POP3 server
              - HOTMAIL : the url of hotmail
              - IMAP : the url of the IMAP server
              server can be specified as server:port.

       USERNAME
              is an optional parameter used for POP3, HOTMAIL and IMAP box
              types.

       PASSWORD
              is an optional parameter used for POP3, HOTMAIL and IMAP box
              types.

       FOLDER is an optional parameter only used for IMAP box types. If not
              present, it defaults to INBOX.
