KASSERT(9)             FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual            KASSERT(9)

NAME
     KASSERT – kernel expression verification macro

SYNOPSIS
     options INVARIANTS

     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <sys/systm.h>

     KASSERT(expression, msg);

DESCRIPTION
     In a kernel compiled with options INVARIANTS, the KASSERT() macro tests
     the given expression and if it is false, calls the panic(9) function,
     terminating the running system.

     In a kernel that does not have options INVARIANTS, the KASSERT() macro is
     defined to be a no-op.  The second argument is a printf(9) format string
     and its arguments, enclosed in parentheses.

EXAMPLES
     The kernel function vput() must not be called with a NULL pointer.

           void
           vput(vp)
                   struct vnode *vp;
           {
                   struct proc *p = curproc;
                   KASSERT(vp != NULL, ("vput: null vp"));
                   ...
           }
