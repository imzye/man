NAME
       Text::Bastardize - a corruptor of innocent text

SYNOPSIS
           #!/usr/bin/perl -w
           use strict;
           use Text::Bastardize;

           my $text = new Text::Bastardize;
           while (my $line = <>) {
               $text->charge($line);
               $text->k3wlt0k;
           }

DESCRIPTION
       Bastardize provides an magical object into which text can be charged
       and then returned in various, slighty modified ways.

       Bastardize has the following methods

       new new creates the array object.

       charge
           charge defines the object's value, and is the reccomended way to do
           so.

       peek
           peek returns the object's value.

       censor
           censor attempts to censor text which might be innaproriate.

       disemvowel
           disemvowel removes vowels from the text.  Works well with
           annoying/offensive blog posts, I'm told.

       k3wlt0k
           k3wlt0k a k3wlt0kizer developed originally by Fmh.

           The SYNOPSIS has an example of k3wlt0k in use, try tossing that
           into a file and running it with ``sh|perl k3wlt0k-filename'' :-)

       n20e
           n20e performs numerical abbreviations.

           (ex. "numerical_abbreviation" becomes "n20e")

       pig pig pig latin.

           (ex. "hi there" becomes "ihay erethay")

       rev rev reverses the arrangement of characters.

       rdct
           rdct converts english to hyperreductionist english.

           (ex. "english" becomes "")

       rot13
           rot13 implements rot13 "encryption" in perl.

           (ex. "foo bar" becomes "sbb one")
