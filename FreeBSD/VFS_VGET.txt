VFS_VGET(9)            FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual           VFS_VGET(9)

NAME
     VFS_VGET – convert an inode number to a vnode

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <sys/mount.h>
     #include <sys/vnode.h>

     int
     VFS_VGET(struct mount *mp, ino_t ino, int flags, struct vnode **vpp);

DESCRIPTION
     The VFS_VGET() looks up or creates a vnode from a (mount, inode#) tuple.

     Its arguments are:

     mp         The mount point.

     ino        The inode representing the file.  This is a unique number
                assigned by the file system when vnodes are first created.

     flags      Additional locking flags to pass through to vget(9).

     vpp        Return parameter for the vnode.

     This is an optional file system entry-point for file systems mainly
     intended for NFS server use, but many file systems use it internally in
     VOP_LOOKUP(9) and similar.

     If the file system does not support this call, then it should return
     EOPNOTSUPP.

     Please see ffs_vget() in sys/ufs/ffs/ffs_vfsops.c for the canonical
     example.
