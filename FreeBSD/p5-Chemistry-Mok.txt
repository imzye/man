NAME
       Chemistry::Mok - molecular awk interpreter

SYNOPSIS
           use Chemistry::Mok;
           $code = '/CS/g{ $n++; $l += $match->bond_map(0)->length }
               END { printf "Average C-S bond length: %.3f\n", $l/$n; }';

           my $mok = Chemistry::Mok->new($code);
           $mok->run({ format => mdlmol }, glob("*.mol"));

DESCRIPTION
       This module is the engine behind the mok program. See mok(1) for a
       detailed description of the language. Mok is part of the PerlMol
       project, <http://www.perlmol.org>.

METHODS
       Chemistry::Mok->new($code, %options)
           Compile the code and return a Chemistry::Mok object. Available
           options:

           "package"
               If the "package" option is given, the code runs in the
               Chemistry::Mok::UserCode::$options{package} package instead of
               the Chemistry::Mok::UserCode::Default package. Specifying a
               package name is recommended if you have more than one mok
               object and you are using global varaibles, in order to avoid
               namespace clashes.

           "pattern_format"
               The name of the format which will be used for parsing slash-
               delimited patterns that don't define an explicit format. Mok
               versions until 0.16 only used the 'smiles' format, but newer
               versions can use other formats such as 'smarts', 'midas',
               'formula_pattern', and 'sln', if available. The default is
               'smarts'.

       $mok->run($options, @args)
           Run the code on the filenames contained in @args. $options is a
           hash reference with runtime options. Available options:

           build_3d
               Generate 3D coordinates using Chemistry::3DBuilder.

           aromatize
               "Aromatize" each molecule as it is read. This is needed for
               example for matching SMARTS patterns that use aromaticity or
               ring primitives.

           delete_dummies
               Delete dummy atoms after reading each molecule. A dummy atom is
               defined as an atom with an unknown symbol (i.e., it doesn't
               appear on the periodic table), or an atomic number of zero.

           find_bonds
               If set to a true value, find bonds. Use it when reading files
               with no bond information but 3D coordinates to detect the bonds
               if needed (for example, if you want to do match a pattern that
               includes bonds). If the file has explicit bonds, mok will not
               try to find the bonds, but it will reassign the bond orders
               from scratch.

           format
               The format used when calling $mol_class->read. If not given,
               $mol_class->read tries to identify the format automatically.

           mol_class
               The molecule class used for reading the files. Defaults to
               Chemistry::Mol.
