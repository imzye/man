NAME
         BFD - Impromptu dumping of data structures for debugging purposes

SYNOPSIS
          my $scary_structure1 = foo();
          my $scary_structure2 = bar();
          use BFD; d $scary_structure1, " hmmm ", $scary_structure2, ...;
          ....

DESCRIPTION
       Allows for impromptu dumping of output to STDERR.  Useful when you want
       to take a peek at a nest Perl data structure by emitting (relatively)
       nicely formatted output with filename and line number prefixed to each
       line.

       Basically,

           use BFD;d $foo;

       is shorthand for

           use Data::Dumper;
           local $Data::Dumper::Indent    = 1;
           local $Data::Dumper::Quotekeys = 0;
           local $Data::Dumper::Terse     = 1;
           local $Data::Dumper::Sortkeys  = 1;
           my $msg = Dumper( $foo );
           $msg =~ s/^/$where: /mg;
           warn $msg;

       I use this incantation soooo often that a TLA version is warranted.
       YMMV.

LIMITATIONS
       Uses Data::Dumper, which has varying degrees of stability and
       usefulness on different versions of perl.
