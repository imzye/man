VERSION
       version 0.05

SYNOPSIS
        use Log::Dispatch::Perl ();

        my $dispatcher = Log::Dispatch->new;
        $dispatcher->add( Log::Dispatch::Perl->new(
         name      => 'foo',
         min_level => 'info',
         action    => { debug     => '',
                        info      => '',
                        notice    => 'warn',
                        warning   => 'warn',
                        error     => 'die',
                        critical  => 'die',
                        alert     => 'croak',
                        emergency => 'croak',
                      },
        ) );

        $dispatcher->warning( "This is a warning" );

DESCRIPTION
       The "Log::Dispatch::Perl" module offers a logging alternative using
       standard Perl core functions.  It allows you to fall back to the common
       Perl alternatives for logging, such as "warn" and "cluck".  It also
       adds the possibility for a logging action to halt the current
       environment, such as with "die" and "croak".

POSSIBLE ACTIONS
       The following actions are currently supported (in alphabetical order):

   (absent or empty string or undef)
       Indicates no action should be executed.  Default for log levels "debug"
       and "info".

   carp
       Indicates a "carp" action should be executed.  See "carp" in Carp.
       Halts execution.

   cluck
       Indicates a "cluck" action should be executed.  See "cluck" in Carp.
       Does not halt execution.

   confess
       Indicates a "confess" action should be executed.  See "confess" in
       Carp.  Halts execution.

   croak
       Indicates a "croak" action should be executed.  See "croak" in Carp.
       Halts execution.

   die
       Indicates a "die" action should be executed.  See "die" in perlfunc.
       Halts execution.

   warn
       Indicates a "warn" action should be executed.  See "warn" in perlfunc.
       Does not halt execution.
