ZFS-CREATE(8)           FreeBSD System Manager's Manual          ZFS-CREATE(8)

NAME
     zfs-create – create ZFS dataset

SYNOPSIS
     zfs create [-Pnpuv] [-o property=value]… filesystem
     zfs create [-ps] [-b blocksize] [-o property=value]… -V size volume

DESCRIPTION
     zfs create [-Pnpuv] [-o property=value]… filesystem
       Creates a new ZFS file system.  The file system is automatically
       mounted according to the mountpoint property inherited from the parent,
       unless the -u option is used.

       -o property=value
           Sets the specified property as if the command zfs set
           property=value was invoked at the same time the dataset was
           created.  Any editable ZFS property can also be set at creation
           time.  Multiple -o options can be specified.  An error results if
           the same property is specified in multiple -o options.

       -p  Creates all the non-existing parent datasets.  Datasets created in
           this manner are automatically mounted according to the mountpoint
           property inherited from their parent.  Any property specified on
           the command line using the -o option is ignored.  If the target
           filesystem already exists, the operation completes successfully.

       -n  Do a dry-run ("No-op") creation.  No datasets will be created.
           This is useful in conjunction with the -v or -P flags to validate
           properties that are passed via -o options and those implied by
           other options.  The actual dataset creation can still fail due to
           insufficient privileges or available capacity.

       -P  Print machine-parsable verbose information about the created
           dataset.  Each line of output contains a key and one or two values,
           all separated by tabs.  The create_ancestors and create keys have
           filesystem as their only value.  The create_ancestors key only
           appears if the -p option is used.  The property key has two values,
           a property name that property's value.  The property key may appear
           zero or more times, once for each property that will be set local
           to filesystem due to the use of the -o option.

       -u  Do not mount the newly created file system.

       -v  Print verbose information about the created dataset.

     zfs create [-ps] [-b blocksize] [-o property=value]… -V size volume
       Creates a volume of the given size.  The volume is exported as a block
       device in /dev/zvol/path, where path is the name of the volume in the
       ZFS namespace.  The size represents the logical size as exported by the
       device.  By default, a reservation of equal size is created.

       size is automatically rounded up to the nearest multiple of the
       blocksize.

       -b blocksize
           Equivalent to -o volblocksize=blocksize.  If this option is
           specified in conjunction with -o volblocksize, the resulting
           behavior is undefined.

       -o property=value
           Sets the specified property as if the zfs set property=value
           command was invoked at the same time the dataset was created.  Any
           editable ZFS property can also be set at creation time.  Multiple
           -o options can be specified.  An error results if the same property
           is specified in multiple -o options.

       -p  Creates all the non-existing parent datasets.  Datasets created in
           this manner are automatically mounted according to the mountpoint
           property inherited from their parent.  Any property specified on
           the command line using the -o option is ignored.  If the target
           filesystem already exists, the operation completes successfully.

       -s  Creates a sparse volume with no reservation.  See volsize in the
           Native Properties section of zfsprops(7) for more information about
           sparse volumes.

       -n  Do a dry-run ("No-op") creation.  No datasets will be created.
           This is useful in conjunction with the -v or -P flags to validate
           properties that are passed via -o options and those implied by
           other options.  The actual dataset creation can still fail due to
           insufficient privileges or available capacity.

       -P  Print machine-parsable verbose information about the created
           dataset.  Each line of output contains a key and one or two values,
           all separated by tabs.  The create_ancestors and create keys have
           volume as their only value.  The create_ancestors key only appears
           if the -p option is used.  The property key has two values, a
           property name that property's value.  The property key may appear
           zero or more times, once for each property that will be set local
           to volume due to the use of the -b or -o options, as well as
           refreservation if the volume is not sparse.

       -v  Print verbose information about the created dataset.

   ZFS Volumes as Swap
     ZFS volumes may be used as swap devices.  After creating the volume with
     the zfs create -V enable the swap area using the swapon(8) command.
     Swapping to files on ZFS filesystems is not supported.
