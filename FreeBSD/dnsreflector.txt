NAME
     dnsreflector – DNS Spamtrap

SYNOPSIS
     dnsreflector [-a address] [-d] [-h] [-p port]

DESCRIPTION
     The dnsreflector daemon listens for DNS queries on a local UDP port and
     answers with records pointing back to localhost.

     Combined with pf this works as a bandwidth efficient spamtrap.

     The options are as follows:

     -a address
              Bind to this address (default: 127.0.0.1).

     -d       Run as daemon in the background.

     -h       Show usage.

     -p port  Bind to this port (default: 53000).
