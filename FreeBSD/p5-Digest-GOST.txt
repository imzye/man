NAME
       Digest::GOST - Perl interface to the GOST R 34.11-94 digest algorithm

SYNOPSIS
           # Functional interface
           use Digest::GOST qw(gost gost_hex gost_base64);

           $digest = gost($data);
           $digest = gost_hex($data);
           $digest = gost_base64($data);

           # Object-oriented interface
           use Digest::GOST;

           $ctx = Digest::GOST->new(256);

           $ctx->add($data);
           $ctx->addfile(*FILE);

           $digest = $ctx->digest;
           $digest = $ctx->hexdigest;
           $digest = $ctx->b64digest;

DESCRIPTION
       The "Digest::GOST" module provides an interface to the GOST R 34.11-94
       message digest algorithm.

       This interface follows the conventions set forth by the "Digest"
       module.

       This module uses the default "test" parameters. To use the CryptoPro
       parameters, use "Digest::GOST::CryptoPro".

FUNCTIONS
       The following functions are provided by the "Digest::GOST" module. None
       of these functions are exported by default.

   gost($data, ...)
       Logically joins the arguments into a single string, and returns its
       GOST digest encoded as a binary string.

   gost_hex($data, ...)
       Logically joins the arguments into a single string, and returns its
       GOST digest encoded as a hexadecimal string.

   gost_base64($data, ...)
       Logically joins the arguments into a single string, and returns its
       GOST digest encoded as a Base64 string, without any trailing padding.

METHODS
       The object-oriented interface to "Digest::GOST" is identical to that
       described by "Digest".
