NAME
       PDL::IO::HDF - A PDL interface to the HDF4 library.

SYNOPSIS
         use PDL;
         use PDL::IO::HDF;

         # Open file 'foo.hdf' with all hdf interface:
         my $HDF = PDL::IO::HDF->new("foo.hdf");

         # You can call functions from either the SD or VS interfaces:
         $HDF->{SD}->SDget("Foo_data");
         $HDF->{VS}->VSgetnames();

         # To close the file:
         $HDF->close();

DESCRIPTION
       This library provides functions to manipulate HDF files with the SD,
       VS, and V HDF interfaces.

       For more information on HDF, see http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/

       The 'new' function of this package uses the 'new' functions for the
       individual HDF interfaces. This allows you to use all of the interfaces
       at one time (if you don't mind the extended syntax).

       Actually using the HDF files comes down to using one of the particular
       interfaces, for that see the docs on those modules.

CONSTANTS
       These constants are now implemented using the perl 'use constant'
       pragma.

       Previously, they were just scalars that were changeable (which is a no-
       no).

       See constant(1) for more info on how to use these in your code.

   Access Modes
       DFACC_READ
               Open the file in read-only mode.

       DFACC_WRITE
               Open the file in write-only mode.

       DFACC_CREATE
               Clobber the file (create it if it doesn't exist, and then open
               with RW mode).

       DFACC_ALL
               Open the file in read-write mode.

       DFACC_RDONLY
               Same as DFACC_READ

       DFACC_RDWR
               Open the file in read-write mode.

   VS Interface Interlacing Modes
       FULL_INTERLACE
       NO_INTERLACE

   Misc. HDF Library Constants:
       MAX_NC_NAME
               This is the max name length for SDS variables, attribtues, and
               just about anything else.

       MAX_VAR_DIMS
               This is the max number of dims a HDF variable can have.
