ZSTREAM(8)              FreeBSD System Manager's Manual             ZSTREAM(8)

NAME
     zstream – manipulate ZFS send streams

SYNOPSIS
     zstream dump [-Cvd] [file]
     zstream redup [-v] file
     zstream token resume_token

DESCRIPTION
     The zstream utility manipulates ZFS send streams output by the zfs send
     command.

     zstream dump [-Cvd] [file]
       Print information about the specified send stream, including headers
       and record counts.  The send stream may either be in the specified
       file, or provided on standard input.

       -C  Suppress the validation of checksums.

       -v  Verbose.  Print metadata for each record.

       -d  Dump data contained in each record.  Implies verbose.

       The zstreamdump alias is provided for compatibility and is equivalent
       to running zstream dump.

     zstream token resume_token
       Dumps zfs resume token information

     zstream redup [-v] file
       Deduplicated send streams can be generated by using the zfs send -D
       command.  The ability to send deduplicated send streams is deprecated.
       In the future, the ability to receive a deduplicated send stream with
       zfs receive will be removed.  However, deduplicated send streams can
       still be received by utilizing zstream redup.

       The zstream redup command is provided a file containing a deduplicated
       send stream, and outputs an equivalent non-deduplicated send stream on
       standard output.  Therefore, a deduplicated send stream can be received
       by running:
             # zstream redup DEDUP_STREAM_FILE | zfs receive …

       -v  Verbose.  Print summary of converted records.
