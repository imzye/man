Sub::Exporter::GlobExporter(3)             User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Sub::Exporter::GlobExporter - export shared globs with Sub::Exporter
       collectors

VERSION
       version 0.005

SYNOPSIS
       First, you write something that exports globs:

         package Shared::Symbol;

         use Sub::Exporter;
         use Sub::Exporter::GlobExport qw(glob_exporter);

         use Sub::Exporter -setup => {
           ...
           collectors => { '$Symbol' => glob_exporter(Symbol => \'_shared_globref') },
         };

         sub _shared_globref { return \*Common }

       Now other code can import $Symbol and get their *Symbol made an alias
       to *Shared::Symbol::Common.

       If you don't know what this means or why you'd want to do it, you may
       want to stop reading now.

       The other class can do something like this:

         use Shared::Symbol '$Symbol';

         print $Symbol; # prints the scalar entry of *Shared::Symbol::Common

       ...or...

         use Shared::Symbol '$Symbol' => { -as => 'SharedSymbol' };

         print $SharedSymbol; # prints the scalar entry of *Shared::Symbol::Common

       ...or...

         my $glob;
         use Shared::Symbol '$Symbol' => { -as => \$glob };

         print $$glob; # prints the scalar entry of *Shared::Symbol::Common

OVERVIEW
       Sub::Exporter::GlobExporter provides only one routine, "glob_exporter",
       which may be called either by its full name or may be imported on
       request.

         my $exporter = glob_exporter( $default_name, $globref_locator );

       The routine returns a collection validator that will export a glob into
       the importing package.  It will export it under the name $default_name,
       unless an alternate name is given (as shown above).  The glob that is
       installed is specified by the $globref_locator, which can be either the
       globref itself, or a reference to a string which will be called on the
       exporter

       For an example, see the "SYNOPSIS", in which a method is defined to
       produce the globref to share.  This allows the glob-exporting package
       to be subclassed, so the subclass may choose to either re-use the same
       glob when exporting or to export a new one.

       If there are entries in the arguments to the globref-exporting
       collector other than those beginning with a dash, a hashref of them
       will be passed to the globref locator.  In other words, if we were to
       write this:

         use Shared::Symbol '$Symbol' => { arg => 1, -as => 2 };

       It would result in a call like the following:

         my $globref = Shared::Symbol->_shared_globref({ arg => 1 });
