SQLITE2DOT(1)           FreeBSD General Commands Manual          SQLITE2DOT(1)

NAME
     sqlite2dot – convert sqlite3 schema to GraphViz input

SYNOPSIS
     sqlite2dot [-v] [-c attrs] [-h attrs] [-p prefix] [-t attrs] [schema]

DESCRIPTION
     The sqlite2dot utility converts an sqlite3(1) schema file to a GraphViz
     file readable by dot(1).  Its arguments are as follows:

     -v      Emits informational messages to standard error.

     -c attrs
             Table-cell attributes.  See the GraphViz documentation for HTML
             labels for a list of cell attributes (except “href”).  You should
             invoke this once per attribute (they will accumulate).

     -h attrs
             First table-cell (header) attributes.  If unset, this will use
             -c.  See the GraphViz documentation for HTML labels for a list of
             cell attributes (except “href”).  You should invoke this once per
             attribute (they will accumulate).

     -p prefix
             Prefix to use for creating HTML ID tags.

     -t attrs
             Table attributes.  See the GraphViz documentation for HTML labels
             for a list of cell attributes (except “href”).  You should invoke
             this once per attribute (they will accumulate).

     schema  An SQLite schema file.

     The outputted GraphViz file serialises tables as HTML-label nodes, each
     of which has one row per table column.  Table nodes are connected by
     foreign keys.

     sqlite2dot is best when creating image maps by piping into dot(1) with -T
     cmapx then -T png or similar backing, then using the usemap attribute for
     the HTML <img> tag.  You can then use sqlite2html(1) for linking to the
     documentation.

CAVEATS
     The schema language accepted by sqlite2dot is currently limited to the
     table declaration with a subset of the column specification.
