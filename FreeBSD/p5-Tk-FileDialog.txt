FileDialog(3)         User Contributed Perl Documentation        FileDialog(3)



NAME
       Tk::FileDialog - A highly configurable File Dialog widget for Perl/Tk.

DESCRIPTION
       The widget is composed of a number of sub-widgets, namely, a listbox
       for files and (optionally) directories, an entry for filename, an
       (optional) entry for pathname, an entry for a filter pattern, a
       'ShowAll' checkbox (for enabling display of .* files and directories),
       and three buttons, namely OK, Rescan, and Cancel.  Note that the labels
       for all subwidgets (including the text for the buttons and Checkbox)
       are configurable for foreign language support.  The Listboxes will
       respond to characters typed over them with scrolling to the first line
       that starts with the given character (or next etc. if this character is
       not present).

SYNOPSIS
   Usage Description
       To use FileDialog, simply create your FileDialog objects during
       initialization (or at least before a Show).  When you wish to display
       the FileDialog, invoke the 'Show' method on the FileDialog object;  The
       method will return either a file name, a path name, or undef.  undef is
       returned only if the user pressed the Cancel button.

   Example Code
       The following code creates a FileDialog and calls it.  Note that
       perl5.002gamma is required.

            #!/usr/local/bin/perl -w

            use Tk;
            use Tk::FileDialog;
            use strict;

            my($main) = MainWindow->new;
            my($Horiz) = 1;
            my($fname);

            my($LoadDialog) = $main->FileDialog(-Title =>'This is my title',
                                               -Create => 0);

            print "Using FileDialog Version ",$LoadDialog->Version,"\n";

            $LoadDialog->configure(-FPat => '*pl',
                                  -ShowAll => 'NO');

            $main->Entry(-textvariable => \$fname)
                   ->pack(-expand => 1,
                          -fill => 'x');

            $main->Button(-text => 'Kick me!',
                         -command => sub {
                             $fname = $LoadDialog->Show(-Horiz => $Horiz);
                             if (!defined($fname)) {
                                 $fname = "Fine,Cancel, but no Chdir anymore!!!";
                                 $LoadDialog->configure(-Chdir =>'NO');
                             }
                         })
                   ->pack(-expand => 1,
                          -fill => 'x');

            $main->Checkbutton(-text => 'Horizontal',
                              -variable => \$Horiz)
                   ->pack(-expand => 1,
                          -fill => 'x');

            $main->Button(-text => 'Exit',
                         -command => sub {
                             $main->destroy;
                         })
                   ->pack(-expand => 1,
                          -fill => 'x');

            MainLoop;

            print "Exit Stage right!\n";

            exit;

METHODS
       •   The following non-standard methods may be used with a FileDialog
           object

       •


   Show
           Displays the file dialog box for the user to operate.  Additional
           configuration items may be passed in at Show-time In other words,
           this code snippet:

             $fd->Show(-Title => 'Ooooh, Preeeeeety!');

           is the same as this code snippet:

             $fd->configure(-Title => 'Ooooh, Preeeeeety!');
             $fd->Show;

       •


   Version
       Returns the current Version of FileDialog

CONFIGURATION
       Any of the following configuration items may be set via the configure
       (or Show) method, or retrieved via the cget method.

   Flags
       Flags may be configured with either 1,'true', or 'yes' for 1, or 0,
       'false', or 'no' for 0. Any portion of 'true', 'yes', 'false', or 'no'
       may be used, and case does not matter.

       •


   -Chdir
       •       Enable the user to change directories. The default is 1. If
               disabled, the directory list box will not be shown.

   -Create
       •       Enable the user to specify a file that does not exist. If not
               enabled, and the user specifies a non-existent file, a dialog
               box will be shown informing the user of the error (This Dialog
               Box is configurable via the EDlg* switches, below).

               default: 1

   -ShowAll
       •       Determines whether hidden files (.*) are displayed in the File
               and Directory Listboxes.  The default is 0. The Show All
               Checkbox reflects the setting of this switch.

   -DisableShowAll
       •       Disables the ability of the user to change the status of the
               ShowAll flag. The default is 0 (the user is by default allowed
               to change the status).

   -Grab
       •       Enables the File Dialog to do an application Grab when
               displayed. The default is 1.

   -Horiz
       •       True sets the File List box to be to the right of the Directory
               List Box. If 0, the File List box will be below the Directory
               List box. The default is 1.

   -SelDir
       •       If True, enables selection of a directory rather than a file,
               and disables the actions of the File List Box. The default is
               0.

   Special
       •


   -FPat
       •       Sets the default file selection pattern. The default is '*'.
               Only files matching this pattern will be displayed in the File
               List Box.

   -Geometry
       •       Sets the geometry of the File Dialog. Setting the size is a
               dangerous thing to do.  If not configured, or set to '', the
               File Dialog will be centered.

   -SelHook
       •       SelHook is configured with a reference to a routine that will
               be called when a file is chosen. The file is called with a sole
               parameter of the full path and file name of the file chosen. If
               the Create flag is disabled (and the user is not allowed to
               specify new files), the file will be known to exist at the time
               that SelHook is called. Note that SelHook will also be called
               with directories if the SelDir Flag is enabled, and that the
               FileDialog box will still be displayed. The FileDialog box
               should not be destroyed from within the SelHook routine,
               although it may generally be configured.

               SelHook routines return 0 to reject the selection and allow the
               user to reselect, and any other value to accept the selection.
               If a SelHook routine returns non-zero, the FileDialog will
               immediately be withdrawn, and the file will be returned to the
               caller.

               There may be only one SelHook routine active at any time.
               Configuring the SelHook routine replaces any existing SelHook
               routine. Configuring the SelHook routine with 0 removes the
               SelHook routine. The default SelHook routine is undef.

   Strings
       The following two switches may be used to set default variables, and to
       get final values after the Show method has returned (but has not been
       explicitly destroyed by the caller)

       •   -File  The file selected, or the default file. The default is ''.

           -Path  The path of the selected file, or the initial path. The
           default is $ENV{'HOME'}.

   Labels and Captions
       For support of internationalization, the text on any of the subwidgets
       may be changed.

       •   -Title  The Title of the dialog box. The default is 'Select File:'.

           -DirLBCaption  The Caption above the Directory List Box. The
           default is 'Directories'.

           -FileLBCaption  The Caption above the File List Box. The default is
           'Files'.

           -FileEntryLabel  The label to the left of the File Entry. The
           Default is 'Filename:'.

           -PathEntryLabel  The label to the left of the Path Entry. The
           default is 'Pathname:'.

           -FltEntryLabel  The label to the left of the Filter entry. The
           default is 'Filter:'.

           -ShowAllLabel  The text of the Show All Checkbutton. The default is
           'Show All'.

   Button Text
       For support of internationalization, the text on the three buttons may
       be changed.

       •   -OKButtonLabel  The text for the OK button. The default is 'OK'.

           -RescanButtonLabel  The text for the Rescan button. The default is
           'Rescan'.

           -CancelButtonLabel  The text for the Cancel button. The default is
           'Cancel'.

   Error Dialog Switches
       If the Create switch is set to 0, and the user specifies a file that
       does not exist, a dialog box will be displayed informing the user of
       the error. These switches allow some configuration of that dialog box.

       •


   -EDlgTitle
       •       The title of the Error Dialog Box. The default is 'File does
               not exist!'.

   -EDlgText
       •       The message of the Error Dialog Box. The variables $path,
               $file, and $filename (the full path and filename of the
               selected file) are available. The default is "You must specify
               an existing file.\n(\$filename not found)"
