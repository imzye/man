WMWORK(1)                        Version 0.2.5                       WMWORK(1)

NAME
       wmwork - keep track of time worked on projects

SYNOPSIS
       wmwork [options]

DESCRIPTION
       wmwork provides a monitor on a 64x64 mini window that helps you keeping
       track of your time. The idea is based on the program Worklog written by
       Truxton King Fulton II. In contrast to Worklog wmwork is a graphical
       application designed to work with the WindowMaker dock, but will work
       with other window managers as well.

OPTIONS
       -d, --days
              displays time in ddd.hh:mm instead of hhh:mm:ss. Note that if
              one timer is at least 1000 hours large this will be the case
              anyway.

       -f, --force
              overwrite stale lock files. Use this if wmwork says that it's
              already running but it isn't.

       -h, --help
              display a command line summary.

       -v, --version
              display the version number.

       --display=id
              set the display to use, e.g.  --display=:0.0.

       --geometry=pos
              set the position of the dock app, e.g.  --geometry=+10+10.  Note
              that the size (64x64) is hard-coded and cannot be changed.

USAGE
       When wmwork is started, the uppermost line shows the accumulated time
       spent on the project, identified by a three letter code in the third
       line. The second line shows the current time spent on the project and
       is initially zero.

       The button V starts the timer, the button || pauses it. The button X
       stops the timer, saving the accumulated time in ~/.wmwork/worklog,
       adding the current session time to ~/.wmwork/worklog.XYZ and resetting
       the latter.

       The buttons < and > switch between the projects found in the file
       ~/.wmwork/worklog.  This can be done only if the timer is neither
       running nor paused.

FILES
       ~/.wmwork/worklog
              contains the projects configuration and log summaries.

       Each line has the form identifier:timestamp[:comment].  Empty lines and
       lines beginning with a # are ignored. Only the first three characters
       of the (case-insensitive) identifier are relevant. When wmwork is
       overwriting ~/.wmwork/worklog it cuts the identifiers down that way.

       ~/.wmwork/???
              contains human readable timestamps for the project XYZ, where
              XYZ is the truncated identifier from ~/.wmwork/worklog.

       Having multiple entries of the same identifier in ~/.wmwork/worklog is
       possible. They are counted independently, but will share the same
       project file.
