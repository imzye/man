NAME
       gl-117 - an OpenGL action flight simulator

SYNOPSIS
       gl-117 [-dlevel -h -v]

DESCRIPTION
       gl-117 is an OpenGL and SDL based action flight simulator written in
       ISO C++.  Enter the Eagle Squadron and succeed in several challanging
       missions leading though different landscapes.  Five predefined levels
       of video quality and an amount of viewing ranges let you perfectly
       adjust the game to the performance of your system.  The game provides
       joystick and mouse support, sound effects, and music.

OPTIONS
       -dlevel
              Set the debug level to level in [0..5]. '0' means quiet and will
              avoid any output, '1' will log fatal errors causing the program
              to crash on stderr, '2' will also print exceptions on stderr,
              '3' will add warnings on stdout, '4' prints additional
              information (predefined) on stdout, and '5' gives developer
              specific messages on stdout.

       -h     Print a short summary on stdout and then quit immediately.

       -v     Display the version number of gl-117 and then quit immediately.

CONFIGURATION
       gl-117 uses a predefined working directory ".gl-117" in the user's home
       directory to load and store all savegame files and read the plain text
       configuration files "conf" and "conf.interface".  If there are no
       config files available, gl-117 will create them using standard
       settings. The contents of the files are quite self-explanatory.

DOCUMENTATION
       Please look at the gl-117 user manual (gl-117.pdf) for installation
       instructions and further gameplay related descriptions.
