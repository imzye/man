WMGlobe(1.3)                                                      WMGlobe(1.3)

NAME
       WMGlobe - The Whole Earth spinning on you desktop...  as a dockable app
       for WindowMaker

SYNOPSIS
       wmglobe [-options]

DESCRIPTION
       WMGlobe is a WindowMaker dock.app that displays the earth on an icon.
       It's an adaptation of XGlobe to WMaker environnement. WMGlobe uses a
       map which is rendered on a sphere by raytracing. Yes, for a 64x64 pixel
       result:-)

OPTIONS
       -v     version. Currently, this should display :

              WMGlobe v.1.3  12 aug 2001 <jerome.dumonteil@linuxfr.org>

       -h     short help

       -zoom  zoom_value
              Value > 1 to magnify the view, value < 1 to lower. Default: 1.0

       -pos  latitude longitude
              Initial viewing fixed at this position, don't follow the sun
              rotation. Accepted values in the form 45°12'36 or 45.21 or
              45:12:36 .  Default: the initial position is "under" the sun,
              and the point of view follows the sun.

       -sun   The point of view follows the Sun (default).

       -moon  The point of view follows the Moon (i.e. you see the Earth as
              you were on the Moon).

       -rand  New random position at every refresh of screen.

       -map  map_file
              Map used for the rendering. Can be JPEG, GIF, XPM PNM, TIFF but
              none BMP.  Default: use internal map of earth.

       -nimap  night_file
              Map used for the dark side of the earth. Must be of the same
              width x height as the day side map.  Default: if the default
              internal day map is used, use a default internal night file (see
              -nonimap option).

       -defnimap
              Use the default night map (with a custom map).

       -nonimap
              Don't use the default night map.

       -delay  seconds
              Time in seconds between each calculation of a new position.
              Limited to 0.04 at compile time (25 frames per second should be
              enough). The sun position move only once per minute, so if you
              use wmglobe without -dlong or -accel option, the CPU cost of
              WMGlobe is *very* low. The use of very low value for -delay plus
              -dlong and -accel can be CPU costly (but very nice...).
              Default: 1.0 sec.

       -dlat  delta_latitude
              Move the point of view by delta_lat degrees per second, with a
              value of 6 the earth make a full rotation in one minute. The
              value can be formated as -pos option.  Default: 0°0'0

       -dlong  delta_long
              Move the point of view by delta_long degrees per second. With a
              value of -0°0'15" the earth make a full rotation in 24 hours
              toward the west. By default, -dlong and -dlat are null. If they
              are used, the view follow their values. Going back to "follow
              sun" mode in parameters screen put -dlat and -dlong to zero.

       -light  light_value
              Level of light of the dark side when there is no night map, from
              0 to 1.  Default: 0.25

       -dawn  dawn_value
              Level of continuity for dawn limit, from 0 to 1. With a value of
              1, the border line between night and day is at maximum contrast.
              Default: 0.2

       -bord  border_num
              0 1 or 2. There are 3 different borders for the icon.  Default:
              2

       -accel  time_multi
              Time warp factor. With -accel 24, the sun make a full rotation
              in one hour (or the earth, I'm not sure). Default: 1.0

       -time  seconds
              Time to display in seconds since 01-01-1970 (see the date
              command). Necessary if you need to be sure that WMGlobe is Y2K
              compliant without changing system time.  Negative values for
              dates before 1970 accepted.  Default: not set, use current time.

       -mk  latitude longitude
              Put a fixed marker at latitude/longitude.  -mk sun : put a
              marker under the Sun position.  -mk moon : put a marker under
              the Moon.  5 markers can be defined simultaneously, so you can
              use wmglobe to predict when Moon will meet the Sun :-)

       -fun  dx dy
              Move the earth image by dx dy pixels in the icon. See puzzle.sh
              to understand why.

       -oz    Start in "austral" mode (for "down under" people)

       -stable
              Keep the globe from going over the poles.

       -d  display
              Select another display

       -w -shape
              Useless, since it is set by default (WMaker dockable
              application)

MOUSE OPTIONS
       left button
              Change longitude while pressed, change longitude & latitude if
              shift+left button.

       middle button
              Zoom in, shift + middle button: zoom out

       right button
              Displays 7 screens of parameters. On every screen, just clic
              with left or right button on the figures to change their value.
              The TIME screen shows an approximation of date and time of the
              earth zone currently displayed, using GMT time + longitude
              offset, it's close to the real local time by one or two hours.
              Others options don't need more help. Intuitive they said...

FILES
       MAPS   Like XGlobe, WMGlobe needs a longitude/latitude map to work. By
              default, it uses a low quality built-in map of earth. But you
              will probably want to use better ones.  You can get maps usable
              with WMGlobe on the net. See the links below.

              using custom maps:

              For the image to be mapped correctly, position 0°North 0°West
              must be in the center of the image and the latitude must be
              linear from 90°N to 90°S.  When using a night map, make sure
              that day and night map have the same dimensions.

ENVIRONMENT
       WMGlobe uses the setlocale(3) function, so you LANG environment need to
       be ok.

       You need WindowMaker 0.62 or higher to use WMGlobe. (use WMGlobe 1.0
       for older versions of WindowMaker).

BUGS
       If you use the  --enable-single-icon compile time option of
       WindowMaker, you can not display more than one WMGlobe.

       WMGlobe hopes that an overflow of a long integer dont generate an error
       and that LONG_MAX +1 = LONG_MIN . This happens with high values of
       -accel when the date go over year 2038. The expected result is wmglobe
       continuing smoothly from 1901.

       Using WMGlobe at high speed through a LAN may induce some load on the
       net.
