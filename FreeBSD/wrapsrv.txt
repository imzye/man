NAME
       wrapsrv - DNS SRV record command line wrapper

SYNOPSIS
       wrapsrv
[SRVNAME] [COMMAND] [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       wrapsrv adds support for connecting to a network service based on DNS
       SRV record lookups to commands that do not support the DNS SRV record.
       wrapsrv implements the weighted priority client connection algorithm in
       RFC 2782. The specified command line will be invoked one or more times
       with %h and %p sequences in the command line substituted for the
       hostname and port elements of the selected SRV record. The command line
       invoked must exit and return 0 after a successful connection or exit
       and return non-zero if the connection fails. wrapsrv will itself exit
       with the return code of the last command line invocation, or it may
       exit with a non-zero return code if the DNS SRV record lookup fails for
       any reason.
