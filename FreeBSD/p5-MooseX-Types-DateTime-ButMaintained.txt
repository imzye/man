NAME
       MooseX::Types::DateTime::ButMaintained - DateTime related constraints
       and coercions for Moose

SYNOPSIS
       Export Example:

               use MooseX::Types::DateTime::ButMaintained qw(TimeZone);
               has time_zone => (
                               isa  => TimeZone
                               , is => "rw"
                               , coerce => 1
               );
               Class->new( time_zone => "Africa/Timbuktu" );
               Class->new( time_zone => "CEST" );

       Namespaced Example:

               use MooseX::Types::DateTime::ButMaintained;
               has time_zone => (
                       isa  => 'DateTime::TimeZone'
                       , is => "rw"
                       , coerce => 1
               );
               Class->new( time_zone => "Africa/Timbuktu" );

CONSTRAINTS
       DateTime
           A class type for DateTime.

           from "Num"
               Uses "from_epoch" in DateTime. Floating values will be used for
               subsecond percision, see DateTime for details.

           from "HashRef"
               Calls "new" in DateTime with the hash entries as arguments.

       Duration
           A class type for DateTime::Duration

           from "Num"
               Uses "new" in DateTime::Duration and passes the number as the
               "seconds" argument.

               Note that due to leap seconds, DST changes etc this may not do
               what you expect.  For instance passing in 86400 is not always
               equivalent to one day, although there are that many seconds in
               a day. See "How Date Math is Done" in DateTime for more
               details.

           from "HashRef"
               Calls "new" in DateTime::Duration with the hash entries as
               arguments.

       DateTime::Locale
           A class type for DateTime::Locale::root with the name
           DateTime::Locale.

           from "Str"
               The string is treated as a language tag (e.g. "en" or "he_IL")
               and given to "load" in DateTime::Locale.

           from Locale::Maktext
               The "Locale::Maketext/language_tag" attribute will be used with
               "load" in DateTime::Locale.

       DateTime::TimeZone
           A class type for DateTime::TimeZone, this now as of 0.05 coerces
           from non-globally ambigious Olson abbreviations, using
           Olson::Abbreviations. This won't work for abbreviations like "EST"
           which are only unambigious if you know the locale. It will coerce
           from abbreviations like "CEST" though.

           from "Str"
               Treated as a time zone name or offset. See "USAGE" in
               DateTime::TimeZone for more details on the allowed values.

               Delegates to "new" in DateTime::TimeZone with the string as the
               "name" argument.

DESCRIPTION
       This module packages several Moose::Util::TypeConstraints with
       coercions, designed to work with the DateTime suite of objects.

       This module started as a fork of MooseX::Types::DateTime. This history
       and explaination is as follows: In Janurary 2009, I began a project to
       bring DateTime::Format::* stuff up to date with Moose. I created a
       framework that would greatly eliminate redundant code named
       DateTimeX::Format. This project's adoption was slowed by then (and
       still currently) bundeled package MooseX::Types::DateTime.
       MooseX::Types::DateTime was a badly packaged extention of two modules
       the self-titled MooseX::Types::DateTime, and another random module
       MooseX::Types::DateTimeX. In Februrary of the same year, I repackaged
       the module MooseX::Types::DateTimeX with the authors blessing into a
       new package, for the purpose of removing its dependenices, namely
       Date::Manip, from MooseX::Types::DateTime.

       Unfortunately, this just added confusion. Now, as of the time of
       writing MooseX::Types::DateTimeX is available as a package, and it is
       available as a module which will be installed by
       MooseX::Types::DateTime. The benefit of removing the dependency on
       MooseX::Types::DateTime was never realized and the patch that updates
       the dependencies, and the build system remains in rt still as of
       writing.

       This module is just the MooseX::Types::DateTime without the requirement
       on DateTimeX::Easy (which requires DateTime::Manip). As of 0.05 this
       module supports globally unique Olson abbreviations, and dies when they
       are not globally unique.
