PAM_GROUP(8)            FreeBSD System Manager's Manual           PAM_GROUP(8)

NAME
     pam_group – Group PAM module

SYNOPSIS
     [service-name] module-type control-flag pam_group [arguments]

DESCRIPTION
     The group service module for PAM accepts or rejects users based on their
     membership in a particular file group.  pam_group provides functionality
     for two PAM categories: authentication and account management.  In terms
     of the module-type parameter, they are the ``auth'' and ``account''
     features.

     The following options may be passed to the pam_group module:

     deny           Reverse the meaning of the test, i.e., reject the
                    applicant if and only if he or she is a member of the
                    specified group.  This can be useful to exclude certain
                    groups of users from certain services.

     fail_safe      If the specified group does not exist, or has no members,
                    act as if it does exist and the applicant is a member.

     group=groupname
                    Specify the name of the group to check.  The default is
                    “wheel”.

     luser          Accept or reject based on the target user's group
                    membership.

     root_only      Skip this module entirely if the target account is not the
                    superuser account.

     ruser          Accept or reject based on the supplicant's group
                    membership.  This is the default.

     Note that the luser and ruser options are mutually exclusive, and that
     pam_group will fail if both are specified.
