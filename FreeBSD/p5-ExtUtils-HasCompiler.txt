NAME
       ExtUtils::HasCompiler - Check for the presence of a compiler

VERSION
       version 0.025

SYNOPSIS
        use ExtUtils::HasCompiler 'can_compile_extension';
        if (can_compile_extension()) {
          ...
        }
        else {
          ...
        }

DESCRIPTION
       This module tries to check if the current system is capable of
       compiling, linking and loading an XS module.

       Notice: this is an early release, interface stability isn't guaranteed
       yet.

FUNCTIONS
   can_compile_loadable_object(%opts)
       This checks if the system can compile, link and load a perl loadable
       object. It may take the following options:

       •   quiet

           Do not output the executed compilation commands.

       •   config

           An ExtUtils::Config (compatible) object for configuration.

       •   skip_load

           This causes can_compile_loadable_object to not try to load the
           generated object. This defaults to true on a cross-compiling perl.

   can_compile_static_library(%opts)
       This checks if the system can compile and link a perl static library.
       It does not check it it can compile a new perl with it. It may take the
       following options:

       •   quiet

           Do not output the executed compilation commands.

       •   config

           An ExtUtils::Config (compatible) object for configuration.

   can_compile_extension(%opts)
       This will call either "can_compile_loadable_object", or
       "can_compile_static_library", depending on which is the default on your
       configuration. In addition to the arguments listed above, it can take
       one more optional argument:

       •   linktype

           This will force the linktype to be either static or dynamic.
           Dynamic compilation on a static perl won't work, but static
           libraries can be viable on a dynamic perl.
