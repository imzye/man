BUS_GENERIC_NEW_PASS(9)                      FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual

NAME
     bus_generic_new_pass – generic implementation of BUS_NEW_PASS for bus
     devices

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <sys/bus.h>

     void
     bus_generic_new_pass(device_t dev);

DESCRIPTION
     This function provides an implementation of the BUS_NEW_PASS(9) method
     which can be used by bus drivers.  It first invokes the
     DEVICE_IDENTIFY(9) method for any drivers whose pass level is equal to
     the new pass level.  Then, for each attached child device it calls
     BUS_NEW_PASS(9) to rescan child buses, and for each unattached child
     device it calls device_probe_and_attach(9).
