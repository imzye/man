AGE(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 AGE(4)

NAME
     age – Attansic/Atheros L1 Gigabit Ethernet driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device miibus
           device age

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_age_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The age device driver provides support for Attansic/Atheros L1 PCI
     Express Gigabit Ethernet controllers.

     All LOMs supported by the age driver have TCP/UDP/IP checksum offload for
     both transmit and receive, TCP segmentation offload (TSO), hardware VLAN
     tag stripping/insertion features and an interrupt moderation mechanism as
     well as a 64-bit multicast hash filter.

     The L1 also supports Jumbo Frames (up to 10240 bytes), which can be
     configured via the interface MTU setting.  Selecting an MTU larger than
     1500 bytes with the ifconfig(8) utility configures the adapter to receive
     and transmit Jumbo Frames.

     The age driver supports the following media types:

     autoselect       Enable autoselection of the media type and options.  The
                      user can manually override the autoselected mode by
                      adding media options to rc.conf(5).

     10baseT/UTP      Set 10Mbps operation.

     100baseTX        Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.

     1000baseTX       Set 1000baseTX operation over twisted pair.

     The age driver supports the following media options:

     full-duplex      Force full duplex operation.

     half-duplex      Force half duplex operation.

     For more information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

HARDWARE
     The age driver provides support for LOMs based on Attansic/Atheros L1
     Gigabit Ethernet controller chips, including:

     •   ASUS M2N8-VMX
     •   ASUS M2V
     •   ASUS M3A
     •   ASUS P2-M2A590G
     •   ASUS P5B-E
     •   ASUS P5B-MX/WIFI-AP
     •   ASUS P5B-VMSE
     •   ASUS P5K
     •   ASUS P5KC
     •   ASUS P5KPL-C
     •   ASUS P5KPL-VM
     •   ASUS P5K-SE
     •   ASUS P5K-V
     •   ASUS P5L-MX
     •   ASUS P5DL2-VM
     •   ASUS P5L-VM 1394
     •   ASUS G2S

LOADER TUNABLES
     Tunables can be set at the loader(8) prompt before booting the kernel or
     stored in loader.conf(5).

     hw.age.msi_disable
             This tunable disables MSI support on the Ethernet hardware.  The
             default value is 0.

     hw.age.msix_disable
             This tunable disables MSI-X support on the Ethernet hardware.
             The default value is 0.

SYSCTL VARIABLES
     The following variables are available as both sysctl(8) variables and
     loader(8) tunables:

     dev.age.%d.int_mod
             Maximum amount of time to delay interrupt processing in units of
             2us.  The accepted range is 0 to 65000, the default is 50
             (100us).  Value 0 completely disables the interrupt moderation.

     dev.age.%d.process_limit
             Maximum amount of Rx events to be processed in the event loop
             before rescheduling a taskqueue.  The accepted range is 30 to
             255, the default value is 128 events.  The interface does not
             need to be brought down and up again before a change takes
             effect.

     dev.age.%d.stats
             Display lots of useful MAC counters maintained in the driver.
