MAC_STUB(4)            FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual            MAC_STUB(4)

NAME
     mac_stub – MAC policy stub module

SYNOPSIS
     To compile the stub policy into your kernel, place the following lines in
     your kernel configuration file:

           options MAC
           options MAC_STUB

     Alternately, to load the stub module at boot time, place the following
     line in your kernel configuration file:

           options MAC

     and in loader.conf(5):

           mac_stub_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The mac_stub policy module implements a stub MAC policy that has no
     effect on access control in the system.  Unlike mac_none(4), each MAC
     entry point is defined as a “no-op”, so the policy module will be entered
     for each event, but no change in system behavior should result.

   Label Format
     No labels are defined for mac_stub.

HISTORY
     The mac_stub policy module first appeared in FreeBSD 5.1 and was
     developed by the TrustedBSD Project.

AUTHORS
     This software was contributed to the FreeBSD Project by Network
     Associates Labs, the Security Research Division of Network Associates
     Inc.  under DARPA/SPAWAR contract N66001-01-C-8035 (“CBOSS”), as part of
     the DARPA CHATS research program.

BUGS
     While the MAC Framework design is intended to support the containment of
     the root user, not all attack channels are currently protected by entry
     point checks.  As such, MAC Framework policies should not be relied on,
     in isolation, to protect against a malicious privileged user.
