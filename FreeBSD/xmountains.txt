NAME
       xmountains - A fractal landscape generator.

SYNOPSIS
       xmountains [ bqgPdEmMrBnZIASTWFGCapcevfRltxsXYH ]


DESCRIPTION
       xmountains is a X11 based fractal landscape generator.  It generates
       random fractal surfaces and displays them in a window.  While the
       program is running the fractal is continuously extended on the right
       and the image is scrolled from right to left to expose the newly
       generated area.


       Flags:
       -b
              Use the root window.
       -q
              Reset the root window when the program exits. This option is
              ignored unless the program is using the root window.
       -g [string]
              Set the geometry of the window.
       -P [filename]
              Write the PID to the specified file.
       -d [string]
              Set the display.
       -E
              Toggle the way that window repainting is done. By default the
              image pixmap is installed as the background pixmap of the window
              and window repainting should be performed automatically by the X
              server. If this does not work on a particular system then this
              flag can be used to enable explicit expose event processing. In
              the default mode root window images will remain in place after
              the program exits.
       -m
              Display a map of the surface rather than a perspective view.
       -M
              Disable reflections in the water.
       -r [20]
              To reduce the load on the X server the program generates several
              columns of pixels before scrolling the image. This flag sets the
              number of columns.  A negative value reverses the direction of
              scrolling. A value of zero makes the program scan across the
              window without scrolling at all.
       -B [80]
              Set the number of shades of each colour that the program
              allocates.
       -n [245]
              Set a maximum number of colours to use. This is just a different
              way of setting the number of shades of each colour.
       -Z [10]
              Set the number of seconds that the program sleeps after
              scrolling the screen.
       -I [40.0]
              Set the vertical angle of illumination.
       -A [0.0]
              Set the horizontal angle of illumination.
       -S [0.6]
              Set the vertical stretch of the surface.
       -T [0.5]
              Set the vertical shift of the surface.
       -W [0.5]
              Set the height where the water occurs.
       -F [1]
              Reduce the variation in the foreground height to ensure a good
              view of the surface. This flag sets the number of iterations for
              which the foreground height is constrained to a constant value.
       -G [-1.0]
              Mean altitude for the for foreground.
       -C [0.3]
              Set the contour parameter. The base colour of a point depends on
              its height and how flat the surface is. This parameter controls
              the relative importance of these factors.
       -a [2.5]
              Set the Altitude of the viewpoint.
       -p [4.0]
              Set the distance of the viewpoint from the front of the surface.
       -c [1.0]
              Set the contrast parameter. Values too far from 1.0 will give
              strange results
       -e [0.3]
              Set the ambient light level. This is a fractional value that
              sets how bright shaded areas will be compared to fully
              illuminated ground.
       -v [0.6]
              Set the vertical light level. The program also implements a
              secondary light source shining from directly above the surface.
              This flag sets how bright this light source is relative to the
              main light source.
       -f [0.65]
              Set the fractal dimension of the surface. This should be in the
              range 0.5-1.0.
       -R [0]
              Set the seed for the random number generator. A value of 0
              causes the seed to be set from the clock.
       -l [10]
              Set the width of the surface. Increasing this value by one
              doubles the width of the surface.
       -t [2]
              Set the number of non-fractal iterations. Increasing this value
              by one doubles the average number of mountains across the width
              of the surface.
       -x
              Use cross updates (see under -H)
       -s [1]
              Control the regeneration steps used to reduce creasing. There
              are three possible regeneration steps controlled by the first 3
              bits of this flag value.  (see under -H)
       -X [0.0]
              regeneration step parameter (see under -H)
       -Y [0.0]
              regeneration step parameter (see under -H)
       -H
              Print a short description of the algorithm explaining the -x -s
              -X and -Y parameters.
