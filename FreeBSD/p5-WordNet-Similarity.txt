NAME
       BNCFreq.pl - Compute Information Content based on British National
       Corpus (World Edition)

SYNOPSIS
        BNCFreq.pl [--outfile=OUTFILE [--stopfile=STOPFILE]
                [--wnpath=WNPATH] [--resnik] [--smooth=SCHEME] PATH
               | --help --version]

DESCRIPTION
       This program reads the British National Corpus (World Edition, December
       2000) and computes the frequency counts for each synset in WordNet.
       These frequency counts are used by the Lin, Resnik, and Jiang & Conrath
       measures of semantic relatedness to calculate the information content
       values of concepts. The output is generated in a format as required by
       the WordNet::Similarity modules for computing semantic relatedness.

       A more detailed description of how information content is calculated
       can be found in rawtextFreq.pl. This program uses exactly the same
       techniques as described there.

OPTIONS
       --outfile=filename

           The name of a file to which output should be written

       --stopfile=filename

           A file containing a list of stop listed words that will not be
           considered in the frequency counts.  A sample file can be down-
           loaded from
           http://www.d.umn.edu/~tpederse/Group01/WordNet/words.txt

       --wnpath=path

           Location of the WordNet data files (e.g.,
           /usr/local/WordNet-3.0/dict)

       --resnik

           Use Resnik (1995) frequency counting

       --smooth=SCHEME

           Smoothing should used on the probabilities computed.  SCHEME can
           only be ADD1 at this time

       --help

           Show a help message

       --version

           Display version information

       PATH

           Path to the root of the texts of the corpus.  (e.g.,
           /home/sid/BNC-word/Texts).
