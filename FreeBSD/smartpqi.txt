NAME
     smartpqi – Microsemi smartpqi SCSI driver for PQI controllers

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device pci
           device scbus
           device smartpqi

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           smartpqi_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The smartpqi SCSI driver provides support for the new generation of PQI
     controllers from Microsemi.  The smartpqi driver is the first SCSI driver
     to implement the PQI queuing model.

     The smartpqi driver will replace the aacraid driver for Adaptec Series 9
     controllers.

     The /dev/smartpqi? device nodes provide access to the management
     interface of the controller.  One node exists per installed card.

HARDWARE
     Controllers supported by the smartpqi driver include:

     •   HPE Gen10 Smart Array Controller Family
     •   OEM Controllers based on the Microsemi Chipset

FILES
     /dev/smartpqi?       smartpqi management interface
