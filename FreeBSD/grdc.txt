GRDC(6)                      FreeBSD Games Manual                      GRDC(6)

NAME
     grdc – grand digital clock (curses)

SYNOPSIS
     grdc [-st] [n]

DESCRIPTION
     grdc runs a digital clock made of reverse-video blanks on a curses
     compatible VDU screen.  With an optional numeric argument n it stops
     after n seconds (default never).  The optional -s flag makes digits
     scroll as they change.  The optional -t flag tells grdc to output the
     time in a 12-hour format.  In this curses mode implementation, the
     scrolling option has trouble keeping up.

AUTHORS
     Amos Shapir, modified for curses by John Lupien.
