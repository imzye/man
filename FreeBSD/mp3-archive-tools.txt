CDDBTOFILENAME(1)     User Contributed Perl Documentation    CDDBTOFILENAME(1)


NAME
       cddbtofilename - rename files according to cddb web page

SYNOPSIS
       cddbtofilename [-v] [-q] [-d] [-a] [-t] [-g] [-f] [-h] [cddbfile|-]
       [file.mp3...]

DESCRIPTION
       cddbtofilename takes data from the cddb (http://www.gracenote.com) web
       page and renames files accordingly.

       As cddbtofilename works by scraping the web page, it can easily break
       if gracenote redesign the web site. If that happens, check the address
       below for an update.

       As cddtofilename uses data from the web page, unlike many other
       freedb/cddb based tools, it has no need for the original CD.

       Input from cddbfile can be either html or formatted output from lynx(1)
       (either from "lynx -dump page.html" or from pressing p then selecting
       Save to a local file from within lynx (when you have found the page you
       want). If raw html is passed to cddbtofilename, it runs lynx to format
       it before parsing.

       MP3::Archive(3) is used for creating filenames and deciding whether a
       particular track should be treated as an album or non-album track
       (unless overridden by -a or -t), see MP3::Archive::Config for details
       on configuring .mp3archiverc to specify your filename styles.

OPTIONS
       -v  Verbose output.

       -q  Quiet (no output). This is the default.

       -d  Dry run. Just prints the changes it would make without actually
           doing them.

       -a  Treat files as album tracks.

       -t  Treat files as non-album tracks.

       -g  Guess whether to treat files as album tracks or not, based on the
           current directory of the file.

       -f  If the number of files specified does not agree with the number
           listed in the cddbfile, normally cddbtofilename will abort. With
           this option it will warn you then carry on, renaming as many files
           as it can.  Use with care.

       -h  Show a short help message.
