MooseX::Types::Signal(3)                   User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       MooseX::Types::Signal - a type to represent valid UNIX or Perl signals

VERSION
       version 1.101932

SYNOPSIS
       Often times you want to send a configurable signal, but you don't want
       someone specifying SIGLOLCAT or 1234, because those aren't valid
       signals.  Or are they?

       With this module, you don't have to know; it will figure out what is
       valid and what isn't, and what names map to what numbers.

       Just use the "Signal" type, and signal numbers are validated.  Use the
       coercion, and you can refer to signals by name, too.

          package Example;
          use MooseX::Types::Signal qw(Signal);
          use Moose;

          has 'kill_with' => (
              is     => 'rw',
              isa    => Signal,
              coerce => 1,
          );

          my $example = Example->new;

          # kill with SIGKILL
          $example->kill_with(9);
          $example->kill_with('KILL');
          $example->kill_with('SIGKILL');

          # in any case, the reader C<kill_with> will always return 9, or
          # whatever your system thinks the number for SIGKILL is

DESCRIPTION
       "MooseX::Types::Signal" exports a type, "Signal", that recognizes valid
       signals on your platform.  The underlying type is a non-negative
       number, but there is a coercion from strings to numbers that recognizes
       signals by name.

       There are also more restrictive types, "PerlSignal" and "UnixSignal".
       "UnixSignal" only understands signals that are in your system's
       "signal.h" header file.  "PerlSignal" only understands signals that are
       in Perl's %Config hash.  "Signal" is either/or, with preference to
       "UnixSignal" over "PerlSignal" when coercing.

EXPORTS
       The exports "Signal", "UnixSignal", and "PerlSignal" are exported by
       Sub::Exporter, so you must explicitly request them, and you can use any
       of Sub::Exporter's magic when doing so.  This is true in general of
       "MooseX::Types" modules.
