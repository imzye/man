NAME
       rar2fs - FUSE file system for reading RAR archives

SYNOPSIS
       rar2fs [options] source target

DESCRIPTION
       rar2fs is a FUSE based file system that can mount a source RAR
       archive/volume or a directory containing any number of RAR archives on
       target and access (read only) the contents as plain files/directories.
       Other files located in the source directory are handled transparently.
       Both compressed and non-compressed (store) archives/volumes are
       supported but full media seek support (aka. indexing) is only available
       for non-compressed plaintext archives. If a RAR volume is selected as
       source the file specified must be the first in the set.

       Since rar2fs is non-interactive, passwords that are required to decrypt
       encrypted archives should be stored in a file with the same name as the
       main archive/volume file but with a .pwd extension. It may also be
       prefixed with a dot '.' character to hide it from simple list
       operations in traditional UNIX style. The latter variant has less
       precedence than the former.  It is also possible to specify a password
       per archive using the .rarconfig file described below.  Be aware that a
       password must be stored in plaintext format and is thus not protected
       in any way from unauthorized access.

OPTIONS
       Besides the standard FUSE options rar2fs accepts the following options
       that can be passed to the program.

       --seek-length=n
              set number of volume files that are traversed in search for
              headers [0=All]

              Normally the RAR specific header(s) describing the files
              contained in a volume is located in the first volume file.
              Providing a value of 1 here should thus be sufficient to cover
              most cases. The default is 0, meaning that the complete set of
              volumes files are searched for headers.  The lower the value
              (starting from 1) the faster the display of folders containing a
              lot of RAR volumes (or volumes with a lot of files) will become
              since the number of open/search/close requests can be reduced
              but with less chance that all files are found and displayed.

              It is also possible to specify the seek length per archive using
              the .rarconfig file described below. This adds the possibility
              to find all files without any significant performance loss.

       --exclude="<file>[;<file>;...]"

       --exclude=<path>
              exclude file filter

              When file access is requested and the file can not be found on
              the local file system all RAR archives in target folder are also
              searched for it. Not until that last operation fails the file is
              considered missing. On some platforms certain files (eg. .lock
              files) are always accessed but are usually never to expect
              within a RAR archive.  Specifying this option will treat the
              listed files differently. If not found on local file system they
              will never be searched for in the local RAR archives. This
              dramatically decrease the folder load/display time during 'ls'
              like operations on such systems.  Each file in the list should
              be separated by a semi-colon ';' character.

              It is also possible to use this option in such a way that it
              instead points to a file that lists the actual exclude filter.
              This is done by specifying an absolute file path (starting with
              '/') instead of a semi-colon separated list of file names. The
              file pointed to may contain more than one line but for each line
              files should be separated by a semi-colon ';' character.

       --no-smp
              disable SMP support (bind to CPU #0)

              Note that this option is only available on Linux based platforms
              with support for the cpu_set_t type (GNU extension).

       --save-eof
              force creation of .r2i files (end-of-file chunk) [EXPERIMENTAL]

              Index information is usually populated by the media player at
              the beginning of a playback session. Since the index table in
              most cases is stored at the end of the file, retrieving this
              information without the use of some post-processing is more or
              less impossible to perform in real-time for compressed/encrypted
              video streams. The mkr2i tool is intended to be used in such
              cases to make the index table available in a separate .r2i file.

              Enabling this option will instead tell rar2fs to guess where the
              index information is located by analyzing the access pattern of
              the media player and then write the end-of-file chunk to an .r2i
              file automatically. This method is however less precise than
              when using the mkr2i tool. Expect an increase in size of the
              generated .r2i file compared to using the mkr2i tool directly.
              Start of playback will also be delayed since almost the entire
              archive needs to be extracted in order to access the data
              towards the end of the file and make it available for playback.

              This option is only supported for AVI 1.0 and multi-part OpenDML
              (AVI 2.0) files created by a properly configured muxer. Badly
              configured muxers will expose themselves by generating invalid
              frame counts. The latter is automatically detected by rar2fs.

              It is also possible to enable/disable this option per archive
              using the .rarconfig file described below.

       --no-lib-check
              disable dynamic library consistency check

              At startup rar2fs validates that the dynamic libraries
              libfuse.so and libunrar.so are compatible/consistent with what
              was used during compilation.  Use this option to by-pass this
              check. Use of this option is discouraged.

       --iob-size=n
              tune the size of the I/O buffer

              The I/O buffer is used to prefetch data at extraction of
              compressed or encrypted archives to make sure streaming is
              possible without delay due to disk or network I/O. Depending on
              the current system resources and network latency this buffer
              might need to be adjusted. A small buffer takes less resources
              but increase the chance that rar2fs must wait for data to arrive
              during a read request. On the other hand, a large buffer will
              increase memory footprint which may not always be desired. Also
              keep in mind that every file being extracted requires its own
              buffer. So the total memory resources required are always the
              buffer size multiplied by the number of active extraction
              threads. Be careful when choosing buffer size. There is no cap
              on the size itself. The only requirement is that it is a 'power
              of 2' Megabytes, eg. 1,2,4,8, etc. The default size is 4MiB.

       --hist-size=n
              tune the size of I/O buffer history

              The I/O buffer history is a sliding window within the I/O buffer
              that is guaranteed to never be overwritten until future data has
              been consumed passed this limit. This means that, even though an
              extraction process can never be reversed, this part of the
              buffer can still deliver "historic" data within this window (eg.
              skipping backwards during movie playback). The size of the
              history buffer is expressed as a percentage of the total I/O
              buffer size between 0% and 75%. Specifying 0 here will
              completely disable this function. The default size is 50% of the
              total I/O buffer size.

       --no-expand-cbr
              disable support for comic book RAR archives

              Default is to always expand comic book RAR archives. In the case
              that comic book readers are used that expect to find the
              original .cbr archive this option can be used to keep such files
              intact.

       --relatime

       --relatime-rar
              update file access times relative to modify or change time

              By default rar2fs adhere to whatever access time update scheme
              is dictated by the underlying host file system. Since the host
              file system is unaware of files inside RAR archives the effect
              on those files will be that of 'noatime'. To overcome this
              limitation the --relatime option may be used.  See mount(8) for
              a description of 'relatime' and other mount options related to
              timestamping.

              Another issue with strictly relying on the host file system for
              timestamping is the effect on RAR volumes. Since reading data
              from a RAR volume might not access all files, only parts of the
              volume will obtain an updated timestamp. Tools relying on access
              time to clean up and delete "old" data might get fooled deleting
              only a subset of the volume resulting in a corrupt archive. By
              using the --relatime-rar option this problem is eliminated by
              making sure all files in a volume set is always updated on
              access. Note that the underlying host file system must be
              writable and user needs sufficient permissions for this option
              to have any effect.

              Except from what is described above the --relatime-rar option
              has the same effect as --relatime which effectively means that
              both these options does not need to be specified. Using
              --relatime makes sense only if updates of the source RAR files
              are not wanted for some reason. There is a slight overhead
              inflicted by using --relatime-rar since in the case of large RAR
              volume archives a lot of files will need a new timestamp. The
              access time is updated only at first read access after a file
              was opened which means overhead should be almost negligible.

       --config=file
              specify per archive configuration file

              Use this file instead of the default .rarconfig that should be
              placed directly under the source folder.  Refer to
              rarconfig.example for an explanation of syntax and details on
              how this feature can be used.

       --date-rar
              use file date/timestamp from main archive file

              By default the dates/timestamps are collected from the meta data
              in the RAR archives.  Use this option to instead force all
              initial dates/timestamps to be set according to the main RAR
              archive file. For volumes this means the first file in the set.
              If the --relatime and/or --relatime-rar options are used it
              might affect the result of this option after mount time.

       --no-inherit-perm
              do not inherit file permission mode from archive

              By default the file permission mode bits are inherited from
              whatever is stored in the archive. Sometimes this is not
              preferable.  This option can be used to instead set the
              permission mode bits based on file type and current file mode
              creation mask, see umask(1p).  Another option is to use the FUSE
              umask mount option.  The latter has the benefit of completely
              ignoring what ever the file system implementation sets but also
              has some caveats with respect to directories versus regular
              files.

MOUNT OPTIONS
       -o locale=LOCALE
              set the locale to be used for RAR file name character set
              conversion

              Default is to set the current locale according to the
              LC_*/LC_CTYPE environment variables.  The need for translation
              of e.g. RAR encoded file names requires that a locale is
              explicitly set by rar2fs.  Othwerwise it would default to the
              "C" locale, which is sufficient for file name stored as standard
              ASCII, but would not translate deterministically for UNICODE
              file names.  Since not all platforms have the possibility to
              manipulate environment variables directly, this mount option can
              be used to set a specific locale to be applied in such character
              set conversions. The possible values that may be assigned to
              locale can easily be determined by the `locale -a` command.

       -o warmup

       -o warmup=THREADS
              start background warmup of internal caches at mount time

              There are use-cases in which it makes sense to trigger a
              background warmup of the internal caches.  This option only has
              an effect for folder style mounts. The default number of
              background workers started is 5.  This can be tweaked by
              assigning a new warmup value. A warmup value of 0 will disable
              the function which is thus the same as not providing the option
              at all. On the other hand a too high number here might result in
              the current system limit for number of open files to be reached
              and the warmup will fail.  The benefit of using this option
              compared to manually populating the caches by issuing e.g. a
              recursive `ls -R` or `find` command is that the internal warmup
              will operate directly on the source folder. This is a lot faster
              than going through the file system mount point which is required
              for the other alternatives. For stacked file systems the warmup,
              if used on both primary and secondary mounts simultaneously,
              will not perform optimally since file system accesses cannot be
              avoided in this case. While the performance is still expected to
              be a lot better than when not using this option, using it also
              on secondary mounts comes with a penalty highly depending on
              current setup.
