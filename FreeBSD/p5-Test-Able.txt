NAME
       Test::Able - xUnit with Moose

VERSION
       0.10

SYNOPSIS
        package MyTest;

        use Test::Able;
        use Test::More;

        startup         some_startup  => sub { ... };
        setup           some_setup    => sub { ... };
        test plan => 1, foo           => sub { ok( 1 ); };
        test            bar           => sub {
            my @runtime_list = 1 .. 42;
            $_[ 0 ]->meta->current_method->plan( scalar @runtime_list );
            ok( 1 ) for @runtime_list;
        };
        teardown        some_teardown => sub { ... };
        shutdown        some_shutdown => sub { ... };

        MyTest->run_tests;

DESCRIPTION
       An xUnit style testing framework inspired by Test::Class and built
       using Moose.  It can do all the important things Test::Class can do and
       more.  The prime advantages of using this module instead of Test::Class
       are flexibility and power.  Namely, Moose.

       This module was created for a few of reasons:

       •   To address perceived limitations in, and downfalls of, Test::Class.

       •   To leverage existing Moose expertise for testing.

       •   To bring Moose to the Perl testing game.

EXPORTED FUNCTIONS
       In addition to exporting for Moose, Test::Able will export a handful of
       functions that can be used to declare test-related methods.

       startup/setup/test/teardown/shutdown
           A more Moose-like way to do method declaration.  The syntax is
           similar to "has" in Moose except its for test-related methods.

           These start with one of startup/setup/test/teardown/shutdown
           depending on what type of method you are defining.  Then comes any
           attribute name/value pairs to set in the
           Test::Able::Role::Meta::Method-based method metaclass object.  The
           last pair must always be the method name and the coderef.  This is
           to disambiguate between the method name/code pair and any another
           attribute in the method metaclass that happens to take a coderef.
           See the synopsis or the tests for examples.

Overview
       1. Build some test classes: a, b, & c.  The classes just have to be
       based on Test::Able.

       2. Fire up an instance of any of them to be the runner object.  Any
       test object can serve as the test_runner_object including itself.

        my $b_obj = b->new;

       3. Setup the test_objects in the test_runner_object.

        $b_obj->test_objects( [
            a->new,
            $b_obj,
            c->new,
        ] );

       4. Do the test run.  The test_objects will be run in order.

        $b_obj->run_tests;
