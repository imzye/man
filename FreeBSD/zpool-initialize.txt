ZPOOL-INITIALIZE(8)     FreeBSD System Manager's Manual    ZPOOL-INITIALIZE(8)

NAME
     zpool-initialize – write to unallocated regions of ZFS storage pool

SYNOPSIS
     zpool initialize [-c|-s] [-w] pool [device]…

DESCRIPTION
     Begins initializing by writing to all unallocated regions on the
     specified devices, or all eligible devices in the pool if no individual
     devices are specified.  Only leaf data or log devices may be initialized.

     -c, --cancel
             Cancel initializing on the specified devices, or all eligible
             devices if none are specified.  If one or more target devices are
             invalid or are not currently being initialized, the command will
             fail and no cancellation will occur on any device.

     -s, --suspend
             Suspend initializing on the specified devices, or all eligible
             devices if none are specified.  If one or more target devices are
             invalid or are not currently being initialized, the command will
             fail and no suspension will occur on any device.  Initializing
             can then be resumed by running zpool initialize with no flags on
             the relevant target devices.

     -w, --wait
             Wait until the devices have finished initializing before
             returning.
