NAME
       slim - Simple LogIn Manager

SYNOPSIS
       slim [options] [<arguments>]

DESCRIPTION
       SLiM is a lightweight login manager for X11, allowing the
       initialization of a graphical session by entring username and password
       in a login screen.

OPTIONS
       -d     run as a daemon

       -p /path/to/theme
              display a preview of the theme. An already running X11 session
              is required for theme preview.

       -h     display a brief help message

       -v     display version information

EXAMPLES
       slim -d
              run slim in daemon mode

       slim -p /usr/local/share/slim/themes/default
              preview of the default theme

STARTING SLIM AT BOOT
       Please refer to documentation of your Operating System to make slim
       automatically startup after the system boots.

       For FreeBSD, you should add the line slim_enable=yes to /etc/rc.conf to
       make slim start on boot.

CONFIGURATION
       Global configuration is stored in the /usr/local/etc/slim.conf file.
       See the comments inside the file for a detailed explanation of the
       options.

USAGE AND SPECIAL USERNAMES
       When started, slim will show a login panel; enter the username and
       password of the user you want to login as.

       Special usernames:

       console
              open a xterm console

       exit   quit slim

       halt   shutdown the machine

       reboot reboot the machine

       suspend
              power-suspend the machine

       See the configuration file for customizing the above commands.  The
       'halt' and 'reboot' commands need the root password, this may change in
       future releases.

       Shortcuts:

       F11    executes a custom command (by default takes a screenshot)

       F1     choose session type (see configuration file and xinitrc.sample)
