Class::DBI::BaseDSN(3)                     User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Class::DBI::BaseDSN - DSN sensitive base class

SYNOPSIS
         package My::DBI;
         use base 'Class::DBI::BaseDSN'; # we'll decide later what our real
                                          # parent class will be
         __PACKAGE__->set_db( Main => $ENV{TESTING} ? @test_dsn : @real_dsn );

DESCRIPTION
       Class::DBI::BaseDSN acts as a placeholder for a base class which will
       be switched for a specific Class::DBI extension when you specify the
       dsn of the database to connect to.

       For example in this case, the Class::DBI::BaseDSN will replace itself
       with Class::DBI::mysql when the "set_db" call is executed.

        package Example::DBI;
        use base 'Class::DBI::BaseDSN';
        __PACKAGE__->set_db( Main => 'dbi:mysql:example', 'user', 'pass' );

       Since this happens at runtime you could pass the dsn as a variable and
       so have it use a completely different extension automatically.  This is
       especially useful for testing, or for applications where dsn may be a
       configuration option.

       If there is no matching extension found, Class::DBI::BaseDSN replaces
       itself with Class::DBI.

THANKS
       Thanks go to Michael Schwern for a snippet to fake out caller, and for
       hashing out some of the finer points of the approach on the cdbi-talk
       list.
