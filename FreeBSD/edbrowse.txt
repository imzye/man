NAME
     edbrowse – Command Line editor, browser, and mail client

SYNOPSIS
     edbrowse [-v] [-h] [-c]
     edbrowse [-d[#]] [-f[#]] [-[p]m] [-[p]fm[#]]
     edbrowse [-d[#]] -m[#] addr1 addr2 ... file [attachments]

DESCRIPTION
     edbrowse is a combination of editor, browser, and mail client text based.
     You can specify several mail accounts and indicate one by its index
     following the email options.

     The options are as follows:

     -v      print version

     -h      print help

     -c      without argument edit the default configuration file.  If the
             first argument is -c filename , edbrowse uses it as config file

     -e      exit when it encounters an error, usually used by batch scripts

     -m      with no other arguments, interactive mail reader

     m[#]    specify an email account index [#]

     -f      fetch mail from all accounts, except the ones that you have
             marked nofetch.

     -f[#]   specify an index [#] to fetch mail from a single account.  For
             instance, -f1 will fetch mail from the first mail account

     -fm     retrieve and read email (combine the -f and -m options)

     -pm -pfm
             like -f and -fm options but pass over the filters

     The debug options:

     -d0     silent

     -d1     show the sizes of files and web pages as they are read and
             written

     -d3     javascript execution and errors: cookies, http codes, form data,
             and sql statements logged

     -d4     show the socket connections, http headers in and out, html syntax
             errors as per tidy5, tree of nodes internal to edbrowse, side
             effects of running javascript and dynamic node linkage

     -d5     messages to and from javascript, url resolution, tidy html nodes

     -d6     show javascript to be executed

     -d7     reformatted regular expressions, breakline chunks
