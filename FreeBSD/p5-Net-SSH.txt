SSH(3)                User Contributed Perl Documentation               SSH(3)


NAME
       Net::SSH - Perl extension for secure shell

SYNOPSIS
         use Net::SSH qw(ssh issh sshopen2 sshopen3);

         ssh('user@hostname', $command);

         issh('user@hostname', $command);

         ssh_cmd('user@hostname', $command);
         ssh_cmd( {
           user => 'user',
           host => 'host.name',
           command => 'command',
           args => [ '-arg1', '-arg2' ],
           stdin_string => "string\n",
         } );

         sshopen2('user@hostname', $reader, $writer, $command);

         sshopen3('user@hostname', $writer, $reader, $error, $command);

DESCRIPTION
       Simple wrappers around ssh commands.

       For an all-perl implementation that does not require the system ssh
       command, see Net::SSH::Perl instead.

SUBROUTINES
       ssh [USER@]HOST, COMMAND [, ARGS ... ]
           Calls ssh in batch mode.

       issh [USER@]HOST, COMMAND [, ARGS ... ]
           Prints the ssh command to be executed, waits for the user to
           confirm, and (optionally) executes the command.

       ssh_cmd [USER@]HOST, COMMAND [, ARGS ... ]
       ssh_cmd OPTIONS_HASHREF
           Calls ssh in batch mode.  Throws a fatal error if data occurs on
           the command's STDERR.  Returns any data from the command's STDOUT.

           If using the hashref-style of passing arguments, possible keys are:

             user (optional)
             host (requried)
             command (required)
             args (optional, arrayref)
             stdin_string (optional) - written to the command's STDIN

       sshopen2 [USER@]HOST, READER, WRITER, COMMAND [, ARGS ... ]
           Connects the supplied filehandles to the ssh process (in batch
           mode).

       sshopen3 HOST, WRITER, READER, ERROR, COMMAND [, ARGS ... ]
           Connects the supplied filehandles to the ssh process (in batch
           mode).

EXAMPLE
         use Net::SSH qw(sshopen2);
         use strict;

         my $user = "username";
         my $host = "hostname";
         my $cmd = "command";

         sshopen2("$user\@$host", *READER, *WRITER, "$cmd") || die "ssh: $!";

         while (<READER>) {
             chomp();
             print "$_\n";
         }

         close(READER);
         close(WRITER);

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
       Q: How do you supply a password to connect with ssh within a perl
       script using the Net::SSH module?

       A: You don't (at least not with this module).  Use RSA or DSA keys.
       See the
          quick help in the next section and the ssh-keygen(1) manpage.

       A #2: See Net::SSH::Expect instead.

       Q: My script is "leaking" ssh processes.

       A: See "How do I avoid zombies on a Unix system" in perlfaq8,
       IPC::Open2, IPC::Open3 and "waitpid" in perlfunc.

GENERATING AND USING SSH KEYS
       1 Generate keys
           Type:

              ssh-keygen -t rsa

           And do not enter a passphrase unless you wanted to be prompted for
           one during file copying.

           Here is what you will see:

              $ ssh-keygen -t rsa
              Generating public/private rsa key pair.
              Enter file in which to save the key (/home/User/.ssh/id_rsa):
              Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):

              Enter same passphrase again:

              Your identification has been saved in /home/User/.ssh/id_rsa.
              Your public key has been saved in /home/User/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
              The key fingerprint is:
              5a:cd:2b:0a:cd:d9:15:85:26:79:40:0c:55:2a:f4:23 User@JEFF-CPU

       2 Copy public to machines you want to upload to
           "id_rsa.pub" is your public key. Copy it to "~/.ssh" on target
           machine.

           Put a copy of the public key file on each machine you want to log
           into.  Name the copy "authorized_keys" (some implementations name
           this file "authorized_keys2")

           Then type:

                chmod 600 authorized_keys

           Then make sure your home dir on the remote machine is not group or
           world writeable.

       Assistance wanted - this module could really use a maintainer with
       enough time to at least review and apply more patches.  Or the module
       should just be deprecated in favor of Net::SSH::Expect or made into an
       ::Any style compatibility wrapper that uses whatver implementation is
       avaialble (Net::SSH2, Net::SSH::Perl or shelling out like the module
       does now).  Please email Ivan if you are interested in helping.

       John Harrison <japh@in-ta.net> contributed an example for the
       documentation.

       Martin Langhoff <martin@cwa.co.nz> contributed the ssh_cmd command, and
       Jeff Finucane <jeff@cmh.net> updated it and took care of the 0.04
       release.

       Anthony Awtrey <tony@awtrey.com> contributed a fix for those still
       using OpenSSH v1.

       Not OO.

       Look at IPC::Session (also fsh, well now the native SSH "master mode"
       stuff)
