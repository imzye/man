UID_WRAPPER(1)                                                  UID_WRAPPER(1)

NAME
       uid_wrapper - A wrapper to fake privilege separation

SYNOPSIS
       LD_PRELOAD=libuid_wrapper.so UID_WRAPPER=1 UID_WRAPPER_ROOT=1
       ./myapplication

DESCRIPTION
       •   Allows uid switching as a normal user.

       •   Start any application making it believe it is running as root.

       •   Support for user/group changing in the local thread using the
           syscalls (like glibc).

       •   More precisely this library intercepts seteuid and related calls,
           and simulates them in a manner similar to the nss_wrapper and
           socket_wrapper libraries.

       Some projects like a file server need privilege separation to be able
       to switch to the connection user and do file operations. uid_wrapper
       convincingly lies to the application letting it believe it is operating
       as root and even switching between UIDs and GIDs as needed.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       UID_WRAPPER
           If you load the uid_wrapper and enable it with setting
           UID_WRAPPER=1 all setuid and setgid will work, even as a normal
           user.

       UID_WRAPPER_ROOT
           It is possible to start your application as fake root with setting
           UID_WRAPPER_ROOT=1.

       UID_WRAPPER_DEBUGLEVEL
           If you need to see what is going on in uid_wrapper itself or try to
           find a bug, you can enable logging support in uid_wrapper if you
           built it with debug symbols.

           •   0 = ERROR

           •   1 = WARNING

           •   2 = DEBUG

           •   3 = TRACE

       UID_WRAPPER_MYUID
           This environment variable can be used to tell uid_wrapper to let
           geteuid() return the real (instead of the faked) UID of the user
           who started the process with uid_wrapper.

           uid_t uid;

           setenv("UID_WRAPPER_MYUID", "1", 1);
           uid = geteuid();
           unsetenv("UID_WRAPPER_MYUID");

EXAMPLE
           $ LD_PRELOAD=libuid_wrapper.so UID_WRAPPER=1 UID_WRAPPER_ROOT=1 id
           uid=0(root) gid=0(root) 0(root)

WORKAROUNDS
       If you need to write code that behaves differently depending on whether
       uid_wrapper is enabled or not, for example in cases where you have to
       file permissions, you can predefine the uid_wrapper_enabled() function
       in your project as follows:

           bool uid_wrapper_enabled(void)
           {
               return false;
           }

       Since uid_wrapper overloads this function if enabled, you can use it in
       your code to detect uid_wrapper.
