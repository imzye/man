NAME
       Encode::Punycode - Encode plugin for Punycode (RFC 3492)

SYNOPSIS
         use Encode; use Encode::Punycode;

         $unicode  = decode('Punycode', $punycode);
         $punycode = encode('Punycode', $unicode);

DESCRIPTION
       Encode::Punycode is an Encode plugin, which implements the Punycode
       encoding.

       This module provides an "Encode" interface for the Punycode encoding,
       which is defined in RFC 3492. This is not very useful because Punycode
       is a special-purpose encoding that is limited to fairly short strings.
       Please consider using Net::IDN::Punycode directly, or even
       Net::IDN::Encode.

       Punycode is an instance of a more general algorithm called Bootstring,
       which allows strings composed from a small set of "basic" code points
       to uniquely represent any string of code points drawn from a larger
       set.  Punycode is Bootstring with particular parameter values
       appropriate for IDNA.  For a more generic (but less efficient)
       Bootstring implementation, see Encode::Bootstring.

       PLEASE NOTE: This module does not do any string preparation or mappings
       as specified by Nameprep. It does not do add any prefix or suffix,
       either.  For higher-level handling of full Internationalised Domain
       Names, see Net::IDN::Encode.
