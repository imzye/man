NAME
       DBIx::Tree - Generate a tree from a self-referential database table

Synopsis
         use DBIx::Tree;
         # have DBIx::Tree build the necessary SQL from table & column names:
         my $tree = new DBIx::Tree(connection => $dbh,
                                   table      => $table,
                                   method     => sub { disp_tree(@_) },
                                   columns    => [$id_col, $label_col, $parent_col],
                                   start_id   => $start_id);
         $tree->traverse;

         # alternatively, use your own custom SQL statement

         my $sql = <<EOSQL;
       SELECT nodes.id, labels.label, nodes.parent_id
       FROM nodes
         INNER JOIN labels
         ON nodes.id = labels.node_id
       WHERE labels.type = 'preferred label'
       ORDER BY label ASC

                                   start_id   => $start_id);

         $tree->traverse;

Description
       When you've got one of those nasty self-referential tables that you
       want to bust out into a tree, this is the module to check out.
       Assuming there are no horribly broken nodes in your tree and (heaven
       forbid) any circular references, this module will turn something like:

           food                food_id   parent_id
           ==================  =======   =========
           Food                001       NULL

Installation
       Install DBIx::Tree as you would for any "Perl" module:

       Run:

               cpanm DBIx::Tree

               Note: cpanm ships in App::cpanminus. See also App::perlbrew.

       or run:

               sudo cpan DBIx::Tree

       or unpack the distro, and then either:

               perl Build.PL
               ./Build
               ./Build test
               sudo ./Build install

       or:

               perl Makefile.PL
               make (or dmake or nmake)
               make test
               make install

Constructor and Initialization
   Calling new()
       new() is called as "my($obj) = DBIx::Tree -> new(k1 => v1, k2 => v2,
       ...)".

       It returns a new object of type "DBIx::Tree".

       Key-value pairs accepted in the parameter list:

       o columns => $ara_ref
           A reference to a list of three column names that can be found in
           the table/result set:

             id_col:     The name of the column containing the unique id.
             label_col:  The name of the column containing the textual data
                         of the row, like a name.
             parent_col: The name of the column containing the id of the
                         row's parent.

           Optional additional columns; note that these will only be used in
           queries built by DBIx::Tree from 'table' specifications - i.e. they
           will not be used with 'sth'- or 'sql'-type query parameters
           (presumably you can provide this functionality yourself when using
           one of those query types).

             order_col:  The name of a column to use for ordering the results;
                         defaults to the column name specified by label_col.
                         This column name does not need to exist in the result
                         set, but should exist in the table being queried.

             order_dir:  An SQL directive specifying the directionality of the
                         ordering; for most databases this is either 'ASC' or
                         'DESC'.  The default is an empty string, which leaves
                         the decision to the database (in most cases, this will
                         be ascending)

       o connection => $dbh
           A DBI connection handle. This parameter is always required. Earlier
           versions of this doc said it was not necessary when using the $sth
           option, but in that case omitting it gets an error on
           prepare_cached.

       o limit => $integer
           Limit the number of rows using an SQL LIMIT clause - not all SQL
           servers support this. This feature was supplied by Ilia Lobsanov
           <ilia@lobsanov.com>

       o match_data => $string
           The value of a partial match to look for - if this is supplied,
           only rows whose label_col matches (match_data + '%') this will be
           selected. This feature was supplied by Ilia Lobsanov
           <ilia@lobsanov.com>

       o method => $sub_name
           A callback method to be invoked each time a tree item is
           encountered. This method will be given a hash as a parameter,
           containing the following elements:

             item:        the name of the item
             level (1-n): the nesting level of the item.
             id:          the unique id of the item.
             parent_id:   an array ref containing the geneology of parent id's
                          for the current item
             parent_name: an array ref containing the geneology of parent name's
                          for the current item

           If the 'threshold' parameter has been set (either via the new()
           constructor or in the call to traverse()), the callback will only
           occur if the tree item is 'threshold' or more levels deep in the
           hierarchy.

       o post_method => $sub_name
           A callback method to be invoked after all the children of a tree
           item have been encountered. This method will be given a hash as a
           parameter, containing the following elements:

             item:        the name of the item
             level (0-n): the nesting level of the item.
             id:          the unique id of the item.
             parent_id:   an array ref containing the geneology of parent id's
                          for the current item
             parent_name: an array ref containing the geneology of parent name's
                          for the current item

           If the 'threshold' parameter has been set (either via the new()
           constructor or in the call to traverse()), the callback will only
           occur if the tree item is 'threshold' or more levels deep in the
           hierarchy.

       o recursive => $Boolean
           Specifies which of two methods DBIx::Tree will use to traverse the
           tree.  The default is non-recursively, which is efficient in that
           it requires only a single database query, but it also loads the
           entire tree into memory at once.  The recursive method queries the
           database repetitively, but has smaller memory requirements.  The
           recursive method will also be more efficient when an alternative
           start_id is specified.  Note that if you supply both a limit
           argument and a threshold argument (implying that you want to see at
           most N records at or below the given threshold), the recursive
           method will be used automatically for efficiency.

       o sql => $sql_statement
           A string containing a custom "SELECT" SQL query statement that
           returns the hierarchical data.  Unnecessary if all of the
           id/label/parent columns come from the same table specified by the
           'table' parameter.  Use only when you need to bring in
           supplementary information from other tables via custom "joins".
           Note that providing an 'sql' argument will override any other
           'table' specification.

       o start_id => $integer
           The unique id of the root item.  Defaults to 1.  May be overriden
           by the 'start_id' argument to traverse().

       o sth => $db_sth
           A prepared (but not yet executed!) DBI statement handle.
           Unnecessary if you plan to provide either a basic table name via
           'table' or a custom SQL statement via 'sql'.  Note that providing
           an 'sth' argument will override any other 'sql' or 'table'
           specification.

       o table => $table_name
           The database table containing the hierarchical data.  Unnecessary
           if you plan to provide either a custom SQL statement via the 'sql'
           parameter or a prepared DBI statement handle via the 'sth'
           parameter.

       o threshold => $integer
           The level in the hierarchical tree at which to begin processing
           items.  The root of the tree is considered to be at level 1.  May
           be overriden by the 'threshold' argument to traverse().

Methods
   new(%args)
         my $tree = new DBIx::Tree(connection => $dbh,
                                   table      => $table,
                                   sql        => $sql,
                                   sth        => $sth,
                                   method     => sub { disp_tree(@_) },
                                   columns    => [$id_col, $label_col, $parent_col],
                                   start_id   => $start_id,
                                   threshold  => $threshold,
                                   match_data => $match_data,
                                   limit      => $limit
                                   recursive  => 1 || 0);

   traverse(%args)
       Begins a depth-first traversal of the hierarchical tree.  The optional
       %args hash provides locally overriding values for the identical
       parameters set in the new() constructor.

TODO
       Graceful handling of circular references.  Better docs.  Rewrite the
       algorithm.  Separate data acquisition from data formatting.

       This module was inspired by the Expanding Hierarchies example that I
       stumbled across in the Microsoft SQL Server Database Developer's
       Companion section of the Microsoft SQL Server Programmer's Toolkit.

       Jan Mach <machj@ders.cz> contributed substantial performance
       improvements, ordering handling for tree output, and other bug fixes.

       Aaron Mackey <amackey@virginia.edu> has continued active development on
       the module based on Brian Jepson's version 0.91 release.

       Co-maintenance since V 1.91 is by Ron Savage <rsavage@cpan.org>.  Uses
       of 'I' in previous versions is not me, but will be hereafter.
