YAFC(1)                 FreeBSD General Commands Manual                YAFC(1)

NAME
       yafc - Yet another FTP client

SYNOPSIS
       yafc [options] [proto://][user[:password]@]hostname[:port][/directory]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual documents Yafc. Yafc is quite a powerful ftp client.  It is
       a console interface to the ftp protocol. If you're looking for a nice
       GUI client, Yafc is not for you. If you, however, use ftp often and
       want a fast, powerful, friendly client Yafc is here for you...

       Some of the features are recursive get/put/ls/rm, nohup transfers,
       colored ls, cached directory listings, autologin and bookmarks,
       powerful aliases and extensive tab completion.

OPTIONS
       -a, --anon
              Try an anonymous login, ie login as "anonymous" with your email
              address as password. Your email address is first looked for in
              the config file ("anon_password"), then in the $EMAIL
              environment variable. If it's not found, a guess is made from
              your user- and hostname.

       -d, --debug
              Print all messages sent to/from server.

       -D, --dump-rc
              Prints the default configuration file to standard output.

       -m MECH, --mechanism=MECH
              Try security mechanism MECH when logging in to the host
              specified on the command line. This will override any 'mech'
              options in yafcrc or bookmarks. MECH is a colon-separated
              string, supported values are "krb4", "krb5" and "none". The
              mechanisms are tried in the order specified.

       -n, --norc
              Do not read the users configuration file. This will cause yafc
              to use its default settings.

       -p, --noproxy
              Do not connect via the proxy. This should be used if connection
              to a host on the local network.

       -q, --quiet
              Do not print the welcome message with copyright information when
              starting Yafc.

       -r FILE, --rcfile=FILE
              Read another configuration file.

       -t FILE, --trace[=FILE]
              Enable creation of trace file. Trace files are mainly for
              debugging and includes every response and command Yafc
              receives/sends. If FILE is specified, use that file instead of
              the default trace file (~/.yafc/trace/trace.pid, where pid is
              the process id number of Yafc.) Trace files can grow quite large
              and can safely be deleted.

       -u, --noauto
              Do not login automagically to the host specified on the command
              line. You can still use bookmark aliases, though.

       -U, --noalias
              As ---noauto, but bookmark aliases is disabled (for host on
              command line).

       -v, --verbose
              Print all responses received (without response code.)

       -w, --wait=TIME
              Use a different time to wait between connection attempts, in
              seconds.  This overrides the value set by "connect_wait_time" in
              the configuration file.

       -W, --workdir=DIR
              Use a different working directory for configuration files and
              temporary files. Default is ~/.yafc.

       -V, --version
              Print version information on stdout and exit successfully.

       -h, --help
              Print a short help description on stdout and exit successfully.
