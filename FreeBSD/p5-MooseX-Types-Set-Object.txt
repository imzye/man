MooseX::Types::Set::Object(3)              User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       MooseX::Types::Set::Object - Set::Object type with coercions and stuff.

VERSION
       version 0.05

SYNOPSIS
           package Foo;
           use Moose;

           use MooseX::Types::Set::Object;

           has children => (
               isa      => "Set::Object",
               accessor => "transition_set",
               coerce   => 1, # also accept array refs
               handles  => {
                   children     => "members",
                   add_child    => "insert",
                   remove_child => "remove",
                   # See Set::Object for all the methods you could delegate
               },
           );

           # ...

           my $foo = Foo->new( children => [ @objects ] );

           $foo->add_child( $obj );

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a Moose type constraint (see
       Moose::Util::TypeConstraints, MooseX::Types).  Note that this
       constraint and its coercions are global, not simply limited to the
       scope that imported it -- in this way it acts like a regular Moose type
       constraint, rather than one from MooseX::Types.

TYPES
       Set::Object
           A subtype of "Object" that isa Set::Object with coercions to and
           from the "ArrayRef" type.
