DESCRIPTION
     The ctfmerge utility merges several CTF data sections from several files
     into one output file, unifying common data.

     The following options are available:

     -f      Match global symbols to global CTF data.

     -g      Don't delete the original debugging sections.

     -s      Use the .dynsym ELF section instead of the .symtab ELF section.

             Sets the label as label.

     -L labelenv
             Instructs ctfmerge to read the label from the environment
             variable labelenv.

     -o outfile
             Use outfile to store the merged CTF data.

     -d uniqfile
             Uniquify against uniqfile.

     -d uniqlabel
             Uniquify against label uniqlabel

     -w withfile
             Additive merge with withfile.
