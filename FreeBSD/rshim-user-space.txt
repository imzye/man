NAME
       rshim - user-space rshim driver for BlueField SoC

SYNOPSIS
       rshim [options]

DESCRIPTION
       rshim is the user-space rshim driver for BlueField SoC. It provides
       ways to access the rshim resources on the BlueField target via USB or
       PCIe from external host machine. The current version implements virtual
       console, virtual network interface, boot stream push, register access
       and some utility commands.

       This driver will probe the rshim backend and create directory
       /dev/rshim<N> for each of them with the following device files.


   /dev/rshim<N>/boot
       Boot device file used to push boot stream to the target, for example,

           cat install.bfb > /dev/rshim<N>/boot


   /dev/rshim<N>/console
       Console device file, which can be used by console tools to connect to
       the target, such as

           screen /dev/rshim<N>/console


   /dev/rshim<N>/rshim
       Device file used to access rshim register space. When reading/writing
       to this file, the offset is encoded as "((rshim_channel << 16) |
       register_offset)". This file can be used by tools like openocd to do
       CoreSight debugging.


   /dev/rshim<N>/misc
       Key/Value pairs used to read/write misc information. For example

       Display the output

           cat /dev/rshim0/misc
               DISPLAY_LEVEL   0 (0:basic, 1:advanced, 2:log)
               BOOT_MODE       1 (0:rshim, 1:emmc, 2:emmc-boot-swap)
               BOOT_TIMEOUT    100 (seconds)
               SW_RESET        0 (1: reset)
               DEV_NAME        pcie-04:00.2
               DEV_INFO        BlueField-1(Rev 0)

       Initiate SW reset

           echo "SW_RESET 1" > /dev/rshim<N>/misc

       Enable the advanced options

           echo "DISPLAY_LEVEL 1" > /dev/rshim<N>/misc

           cat /dev/rshim0/misc
               DISPLAY_LEVEL   1 (0:basic, 1:advanced, 2:log)
               BOOT_MODE       1 (0:rshim, 1:emmc, 2:emmc-boot-swap)
               BOOT_TIMEOUT    100 (seconds)
               SW_RESET        0 (1: reset)

               DEV_INFO        BlueField-1(Rev 0)
               PEER_MAC        00:1a:ca:ff:ff:01 (rw)
               PXE_ID          0x00000000 (rw)
               VLAN_ID         0 0 (rw)

OPTIONS
       -b, --backend
           Specify the backend to attach, which can be one of usb, pcie or
           pcie_lf. If not specified, the driver will scan all rshim backends
           unless the '-d' option is given with a device name specified.

       -d, --device
           Specify the device name to attach with the format below. The
           backend driver can be deduced from the device name, thus the '-b'
           option is not needed.

               PCIe backend:
                   pcie-<bus>:<device>.<function>. Example: pcie-04:00.2
                   Devices can be found with command 'lspci -n'.

               PCIe backend in livefish mode:
                   pcie-lf-<bus>:<device>.<function>. Example: pcie-04:00.2
                   Devices can be found with command 'lspci -n'.

               USB backend:
                   usb-<bus>-xx.xx. Example: usb-2-1.7
                   Devices can be found under /sys/bus/usb/devices/.

       -f, --foreground
           Run in forground.

       -i, --index
           Specify the index to create device path /dev/rshim<index>. It's
           also used to create network interface name tmfifo_net<index>. This
           option is needed when multiple rshim instances are running.

       -l, --log-level
           Log level (0:none, 1:error, 2:warning, 3:notice, 4:debug) Log
           messages will be printed to standard output when running in
           foreground, or in syslog when running as a daemon.

       -v, --version
           Display version

CONFIGURATION FILE
       Rshim configuration file (/etc/rshim.conf) can be used to specify the
       static mapping between rshim devices and rshim names. It can also be
       used to ignore some rshim devices.

       Example:
           # Map usb-2-1.7 to rshim0
           rshim0       usb-2-1.7

           # Map pcie-0000:04:00.2 to rshim1
           rshim1       pcie-0000:04:00.2

           # Ignore usb-1-1.4
           none         usb-1-1.4
