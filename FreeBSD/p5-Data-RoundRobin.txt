NAME
       Data::RoundRobin - Serve data in a round robin manner.

SYNOPSIS
         my @array = qw(a b);
         # OO Interface
         my $rr = Data::RoundRobin->new(@array);

         print $rr->next; # a
         print $rr->next; # b
         print $rr->next; # a
         print $rr->next; # b
         ...

         # Infinite Loop
         while(my $elem = $rr->next) {
            ...
         }

         # Operator overloading
         my $rr = Data::RoundRobin->new(qw(a b));
         print $rr; # a
         print $rr; # b
         print $rr; # a

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a round roubin object implementation.  It is
       similar to an iterator, only the internal counter is reset to the
       begining whenever it reaches the end. It might also be considered as a
       circular iterator.

METHODS
       new Constructor, a list should be given to construct a
           "Data::RoundRobin" object.

       next
           Retrieve next value of this instance.

       numerify
           Retrieve next numerifed value of this instance. Invoked by Perl's
           operator overloadding mechanism.
