NAME
       exrblur - perform a gaussian blur on an OpenEXR image


SYNOPSIS
       exrblur input.exr output.exr kernelsize


DESCRIPTION
       Performs a gaussian blur on the input image.  This is useful for
       generating a whitepoint image for chromatic adaptation of locally
       adapting tone mapping algorithms.

       The kernel size for the blur is given as a fraction of the image width.
       So, a kernelsize of 0.25 will perform a blur with a kernel width 1/4 of
       the image width.
