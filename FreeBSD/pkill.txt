DESCRIPTION
     The pgrep command searches the process table on the running system and
     prints the process IDs of all processes that match the criteria given on
     the command line.

     The pkill command searches the process table on the running system and
     signals all processes that match the criteria given on the command line.

     The following options are available:

     -F pidfile        Restrict matches to a process whose PID is stored in
                       the pidfile file.

     -G gid            Restrict matches to processes with a real group ID in
                       the comma-separated list gid.

     -I                Request confirmation before attempting to signal each
                       process.

     -L                The pidfile file given for the -F option must be locked
                       with the flock(2) syscall or created with pidfile(3).

     -M core           Extract values associated with the name list from the
                       specified core instead of the currently running system.

     -N system         Extract the name list from the specified system instead
                       of the default, which is the kernel image the system
                       has booted from.

     -P ppid           Restrict matches to processes with a parent process ID
                       in the comma-separated list ppid.

     -S                Search also in system processes (kernel threads).

     -U uid            Restrict matches to processes with a real user ID in
                       the comma-separated list uid.

     -d delim          Specify a delimiter to be printed between each process
                       ID.  The default is a newline.  This option can only be
                       used with the pgrep command.

     -a                Include process ancestors in the match list.  By
                       default, the current pgrep or pkill process and all of
                       its ancestors are excluded (unless -v is used).

     -c class          Restrict matches to processes running with specified
                       login class class.

     -f                Match against full argument lists.  The default is to
                       match against process names.

     -g pgrp           Restrict matches to processes with a process group ID
                       in the comma-separated list pgrp.  The value zero is
                       taken to mean the process group ID of the running pgrep
                       or pkill command.

     -i                Ignore case distinctions in both the process table and
                       the supplied pattern.

     -j jail           Restrict matches to processes inside the specified
                       jails.  The argument jail may be “any” to match
                       processes in any jail, “none” to match processes not in
                       jail, or a comma-separated list of jail IDs or names.

     -l                Long output.  For pgrep, print the process name in
                       addition to the process ID for each matching process.
                       If used in conjunction with -f, print the process ID
                       and the full argument list for each matching process.
                       For pkill, display the kill command used for each
                       process killed.

     -n                Select only the newest (most recently started) of the
                       matching processes.

     -o                Select only the oldest (least recently started) of the
                       matching processes.

     -q                For pgrep, Do not write anything to standard output.

     -s sid            Restrict matches to processes with a session ID in the
                       comma-separated list sid.  The value zero is taken to
                       mean the session ID of the running pgrep or pkill
                       command.

     -t tty            Restrict matches to processes associated with a
                       terminal in the comma-separated list tty.  Terminal
                       names may be of the form ttyxx or the shortened form
                       xx.  A single dash (‘-’) matches processes not
                       associated with a terminal.

     -u euid           Restrict matches to processes with an effective user ID
                       in the comma-separated list euid.

     -v                Reverse the sense of the matching; display processes
                       that do not match the given criteria.

     -x                Require an exact match of the process name, or argument
                       list if -f is given.  The default is to match any
                       substring.

     -signal           A non-negative decimal number or symbolic signal name
                       specifying the signal to be sent instead of the default
                       TERM.  This option is valid only when given as the
                       first argument to pkill.

     If any pattern operands are specified, they are used as extended regular
     expressions to match the command name or full argument list of each
     process.  If the -f option is not specified, then the pattern will
     attempt to match the command name.  However, presently FreeBSD will only
     keep track of the first 19 characters of the command name for each
     process.  Attempts to match any characters after the first 19 of a
     command name will quietly fail.

     Note that a running pgrep or pkill process will never consider itself nor
     system processes (kernel threads) as a potential match.

EXIT STATUS
     The pgrep and pkill utilities return one of the following values upon
     exit:

     0       One or more processes were matched.

     1       No processes were matched.

     2       Invalid options were specified on the command line.

     3       An internal error occurred.

COMPATIBILITY
     Historically the option “-j 0” means any jail, although in other
     utilities such as ps(1) jail ID 0 has the opposite meaning, not in jail.
     Therefore “-j 0” is deprecated, and its use is discouraged in favor of
     “-j any”.

HISTORY
     The pkill and pgrep utilities first appeared in NetBSD 1.6.  They are
     modelled after utilities of the same name that appeared in Sun Solaris 7.
     They made their first appearance in FreeBSD 5.3.
