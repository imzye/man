NAME
       Template::Plugin::YAML - Plugin interface to YAML

SYNOPSIS
           [% USE YAML %]

           [% YAML.dump(variable) %]
           [% YAML.dump_html(variable) %]
           [% value = YAML.undump(yaml_string) %]
           [% YAML.dumpfile(filename, variable) %]
           [% value = YAML.undumpfile(filename) %]

DESCRIPTION
       This is a simple Template Toolkit Plugin Interface to the YAML module.
       A YAML object will be instantiated via the following directive:

           [% USE YAML %]

       As a standard plugin, you can also specify its name in lower case:

           [% USE yaml %]

METHODS
       These are the methods supported by the YAML object.

   dump( @variables )
       Generates a raw text dump of the data structure(s) passed

           [% USE Dumper %]
           [% yaml.dump(myvar) %]
           [% yaml.dump(myvar, yourvar) %]

   dump_html( @variables )
       Generates a dump of the data structures, as per "dump", but with the
       characters <, > and & converted to their equivalent HTML entities,
       spaces converted to &nbsp; and newlines converted to <br>.

           [% USE yaml %]
           [% yaml.dump_html(myvar) %]

   undump( $string )
       Converts a YAML-encoded string into the equivalent data structure.
       Here's a way to deep-copy a complex structure by completely serializing
       the data.

         [% USE yaml;
            yaml_string = yaml.dump(complex_data_structure);
            complex_copy = yaml.undump(yaml_string);
         %]

   dumpfile( $file, @variables )
       Converts the data to YAML encoding, and dumps it to the specified
       filepath.

         [% USE yaml; yaml.dumpfile(".storage", my_data) %]

   undumpfile( $file )
       Loads the YAML-encoded data from the specified filepath

         [% USE yaml; my_data = yaml.undumpfile(".storage") %]
