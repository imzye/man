NAME
       Google::Chart - Interface to Google Charts API

SYNOPSIS
         use Google::Chart;

         my $chart = Google::Chart->new(
           type => "Bar",
           data => [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
         );

         print $chart->as_uri, "\n"; # or simply print $chart, "\n"

         $chart->render_to_file( filename => 'filename.png' );

DESCRITPION
       Google::Chart provides a Perl Interface to Google Charts API
       (http://code.google.com/apis/chart/).

       Please note that version 0.05000 is a major rewrite, and has little to
       no backwards compatibility.

METHODS
   new(%args)
       Creates a new Google::Chart instance.

       type
           Specifies the chart type, such as line, bar, pie, etc. If given a
           string like 'Bar', it will instantiate an instance of
           Google::Chart::Type::Bar by invoking argument-less constructor.

           If you want to pass parameters to the constructor, either pass in
           an already instanstiated object, or pass in a hash, which will be
           coerced to the appropriate object

             my $chart = Google::Chart->new(
               type => Google::Chart::Bar->new(
                 orientation => "horizontal"
               )
             );

             # or

             my $chart = Google::Chart->new(
               type => {
                 module => "Bar",
                 args   => {
                   orientation => "horizontal"
                 }
               }
             );

       size
           Specifies the chart size. Strings like "400x300", hash references,
           or already instantiated objects can be used:

             my $chart = Google::Chart->new(
               size => "400x300",
             );

             my $chart = Google::Chart->new(
               size => {
                 width => 400,
                 height => 300
               }
             );

       marker
           Specifies the markers that go on line charts.

       axis
           Specifies the axis labels and such that go on line and bar charts

       legend
       color
       fill


   as_uri()
       Returns the URI that represents the chart object.

   render()
       Generates the chart image, and returns the contents.  This method
       internally uses LWP::UserAgent. If you want to customize LWP settings,
       create an instance of LWP::UserAgent and pass it in the constructor

           Google::Chart->new(
               ....,
               ua => LWP::UserAgent->new( %your_args )
           );

       Proxy settings are automatically read via LWP::UserAgent->env_proxy(),
       unless you specify GOOGLE_CHART_ENV_PROXY environment variable to 0

   render_to_file( %args )
       Generates the chart, and writes the contents out to the file specified
       by `filename' parameter

   BASE_URI
       The base URI for Google Chart

FEEDBACK
       We don't believe that we fully utilize Google Chart's abilities. So
       there might be things missing, things that should be changed for easier
       use.  If you find any such case, PLEASE LET US KNOW! Suggestions are
       welcome, but code snippets, pseudocode, or even better, test cases, are
       most welcome.

TODO
       Standardize Interface
           Objects need to expect data in a standard format. This is not the
           case yet.  (comments welcome)

       Moose-ish Errors
           I've been reported that some Moose-related errors occur on certain
           platforms.  I have not been able to reproduce it myself, so if you
           do, please let me know.
