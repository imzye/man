MURPHI‐FORMAT(1)        FreeBSD General Commands Manual       MURPHI‐FORMAT(1)

NAME
       murphi-format - reformat Murphi models

SYNOPSIS
       murphi-format options [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       murphi-format is a utility bundled with the Rumur model checker. It can
       be used to reflow the text of a Murphi model into a consistent
       indentation style.

       murphi-format intentionally has very few options. It aims to settle
       style debates by simply mandating a universally disliked format.

       No line length limit is applied. The content within comments is not
       reflowed. If your input contains long expressions, these will appear as
       long lines in the output. The intention behind this choice is to
       encourage users to outline long expressions into functions.

       See rumur(1) for more information about Rumur or Murphi.

OPTIONS
       --debug or -d
              Enable debug mode. This produces some extra output intended for
              developers who are debugging murphi-format itself.

       --help or 0fR
              Show this documentation.

       --in-place or -i
              Write the output of reformatting back into the same path as the
              source. This is only valid when one or more paths are given; it
              cannot be used when reformatting stdin.

       --output=FILE or -o FILE
              Write output to the given path. By default, output is written to
              stdout.

       --tab=STRING or -t STRING
              Text to use as one tab worth of indentation. By default, this is
              two spaces.

       --version
              Print murphi-format version and then exit.

NOTES
       To disable formatting for a specific section of code, special comments
       are recognised:

              rule begin
                   x := y;
                   y := z;
                   -- murphi-format: off
                   z := w; w := x;
                   -- murphi-format: on
              end;

       Code between the murphi-format: off and murphi-format: on comments will
       be preserved as-is. Note that these must be line comments, not
       multi‐line comments. Additionally they must have the exact spacing
       shown, not arbitrary white space between e.g. the : and off.
