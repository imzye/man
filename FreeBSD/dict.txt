NAME
       dict - DICT Protocol Client

SYNOPSIS
       dict word
       dict [options] [word]
       dict [options] dict://host:port/d:word:database
       dict [options] dict://host:port/m:word:database:strategy

DESCRIPTION
       dict is a client for the Dictionary Server Protocol (DICT), a TCP
       transaction based query/response protocol that provides access to
       dictionary definitions from a set of natural language dictionary
       databases.  Exit status is 0 if operation succeeded, or non-zero
       otherwise.
       See EXIT STATUS section.


OPTIONS
       -h server or --host server
              Specifies the hostname for the DICT server.  Server/port
              combinations can be specified in the configuration file.  If no
              servers are specified in the configuration file or or on the
              command line, dict will fail.  If IP lookup for a server expands
              to a list of IP addresses (as dict.org does currently), then
              each IP will be tried in the order listed.

       -p service or --port service
              Specifies the port (e.g., 2628) or service (e.g., dict) for
              connections.  The default is 2628, as specified in the DICT
              Protocol RFC.  Server/port combinations can be specified in the
              configuration file.

       -d dbname or --database dbname
              Specifies a specific database to search.  The default is to
              search all databases (a "*" from the DICT protocol).  Note that
              a "!" in the DICT protocol means to search all of the databases
              until a match is found, and then stop searching.

       -m or --match
              Instead of printing a definition, perform a match using the
              specified strategy.

       -s strategy or --strategy strategy
              Specify a matching strategy.  By default, the server default
              match strategy is used.  This is usually "exact" for
              definitions, and some form of spelling-correction strategy for
              matches ("." from the DICT protocol).  The available strategies
              are dependent on the server implementation.  For a list of
              available strategies, see the -S or --strats option.

       -C or --nocorrect
              Usually, if a definition is requested and the word cannot be
              found, spelling correction is requested from the server, and a
              list of possible words are provided.  This option disables the
              generation of this list.

       -c file or --config file
              Specify the configuration file.  The default is to try ~/.dictrc
              and /usr/local/etc/dict.conf, using the first file that exists.
              If a specific configuration file is specified, then the defaults
              will not be tried.

       -D or --dbs
              Query the server and display a list of available databases.

       -S or --strats
              Query the server and display a list of available search
              strategies.

       -H or --serverhelp
              Query the server and display the help information that it
              provides.

       -i dbname or --info dbname
              Request information on the specified database (usually the
              server will provide origination, descriptive, or other
              information about the database or its contents).

       -I or --serverinfo
              Query the server and display information about the server.

       -M or --mime
              Send OPTION MIME command to the server.
              NOTE: Server's capabilities are not checked.


       -f or --formatted
              Enables formatted output, i.e. output convenient for
              postprocessing by standard UNIX utilities. No, it is not XML ;-)
              Also error and warning messages like
               " No matches...", " Invalid strategy..." etc. are sent to
              stderr, not to stdout.
              Format:
               -I, -i, -H and similar:
                  host<TAB>port
                  <SPC><SPC>line1
                  <SPC><SPC>line2
                  ...
               -S:
                  host<TAB>port<TAB>strategy1<TAB>short description1
                  host<TAB>port<TAB>strategy2<TAB>short description2
                  ...
               -D:
                  host<TAB>port<TAB>database1<TAB>database description1
                  host<TAB>port<TAB>database2<TAB>database description2
                  ...
               -m:
                  host<TAB>port<TAB>database1<TAB>match1
                  host<TAB>port<TAB>database2<TAB>match2
                  ...


       -a or --noauth
              Disable authentication (i.e., don't send an AUTH command).

       -u user or --user user
              Specifies the username for authentication.

       -k key or --key key
              Specifies the shared secret for authentication.

       -V or --version
              Display version information.

       -L or --license
              Display copyright and license information.

       -4     Forces dict to use IPv4 addresses only.

       -6     Forces dict to use IPv6 addresses only.

       --help Display help information.

       -v or --verbose
              Be verbose.

       -r or --raw
              Be very verbose: show the raw client/server interaction.

       --pipesize
              Specify the buffer size for pipelineing commands.  The default
              is 256, which should be sufficient for general tasks and be
              below the MTU for most transport media.  Larger values may
              provide faster or slower throughput, depending on MTU.  If the
              buffer is too small, requests will be serialized.  Values less
              than 0 and greater than one million are silently changed to
              something more reasonable.

       --client text
              Specifies additional text to be sent using the CLIENT command.

       --debug flag
              Set a debugging flag.  Valid flags are:

              verbose
                     The same as -v or --verbose.

              raw    The same as -r or --raw.

              scan   Debug the scanner for the configuration file.

              parse  Debug the parser for the configuration file.

              pipe   Debug TCP pipelining support (see the DICT RFC and
                     RFC1854).

              serial Disable pipelining support.

              time   Perform transaction timing.

CONFIGURATION
       The configuration file currently has a very simple format.  Lines are
       used to specify servers, for example:
              server dict.org
       or, with options:
              server dict.org { port 8080 }
              server dict.org { user username secret }
              server dict.org { port dict user username secret }
       the port and user options may be specified in any order.  The port
       option is used to specify an optional port (e.g., 2628) or service
       (e.g., dict) for the TCP/IP connection.  The user option is used to
       specify a username and shared secret to be used for authentication to
       this particular server.

       Servers are tried in the order listed until a connection is made.

BUGS
       If a dict: URL is given on the command line, only the first one is
       used.  The rest are ignored.

       If a dict: URL contains a specifier for the nth definition or match of
       a word, it will be ignored and all the definitions or matches will be
       provided.  This violates the RFC, and will be corrected in a future
       release.

       If a dict: URL contains a shared secret, it will not be parsed
       correctly.

       When OPTION MIME command is sent to the server (-M option) , server's
       capabilities are not checked.
