CAVEATS
     Working directory for the build stage and the apply stage
         Applying a Makejail is not the same as running it, specifically the
         working directory used.  Applying a Makejail generates a initscript
         and the current directory is used as the working directory, while
         running a Makejail, at least for the build stage, generates an sh(1)
         script that changes the working directory depending on the INCLUDE
         instruction in a Makejail file.
