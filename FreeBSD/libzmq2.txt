ZMQ_BIND(3)                       0MQ Manual                       ZMQ_BIND(3)



NAME
       zmq_bind - accept connections on a socket

SYNOPSIS
       int zmq_bind (void *socket, const char *endpoint);

DESCRIPTION
       The zmq_bind() function shall create an endpoint for accepting
       connections and bind it to the socket referenced by the socket
       argument.

       The endpoint argument is a string consisting of two parts as follows:
       transport://address. The transport part specifies the underlying
       transport protocol to use. The meaning of the address part is specific
       to the underlying transport protocol selected.

       The following transports are defined:

       inproc
           local in-process (inter-thread) communication transport, see
           zmq_inproc(7)

       ipc
           local inter-process communication transport, see zmq_ipc(7)

       tcp
           unicast transport using TCP, see zmq_tcp(7)

       pgm, epgm
           reliable multicast transport using PGM, see zmq_pgm(7)

       With the exception of ZMQ_PAIR sockets, a single socket may be
       connected to multiple endpoints using zmq_connect(), while
       simultaneously accepting incoming connections from multiple endpoints
       bound to the socket using zmq_bind(). Refer to zmq_socket(3) for a
       description of the exact semantics involved when connecting or binding
       a socket to multiple endpoints.

RETURN VALUE
       The zmq_bind() function shall return zero if successful. Otherwise it
       shall return -1 and set errno to one of the values defined below.

ERRORS
       EINVAL
           The endpoint supplied is invalid.

       EPROTONOSUPPORT
           The requested transport protocol is not supported.

       ENOCOMPATPROTO
           The requested transport protocol is not compatible with the socket
           type.

       EADDRINUSE
           The requested address is already in use.

       EADDRNOTAVAIL
           The requested address was not local.

       ENODEV
           The requested address specifies a nonexistent interface.

       ETERM
           The 0MQ context associated with the specified socket was
           terminated.

       ENOTSOCK
           The provided socket was invalid.

       EMTHREAD
           No I/O thread is available to accomplish the task.

EXAMPLE
       Binding a publisher socket to an in-process and a TCP transport.

           /* Create a ZMQ_PUB socket */
           void *socket = zmq_socket (context, ZMQ_PUB);
           assert (socket);
           /* Bind it to a in-process transport with the address 'my_publisher' */
           int rc = zmq_bind (socket, "inproc://my_publisher");
           assert (rc == 0);
           /* Bind it to a TCP transport on port 5555 of the 'eth0' interface */
           rc = zmq_bind (socket, "tcp://eth0:5555");
           assert (rc == 0);
