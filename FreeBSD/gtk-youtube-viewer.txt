       auto-generated captions are ignored.

           best        # best audio quality available (<=192kbps)
           medium      # medium audio quality (<=128kbps)

       However, these streaming URLs are heavily throttled by YouTube.

       When this option is disabled, a fallback method will be used instead
       ("yt-dlp"/"youtube-dl" or invidious instances).

   bypass_age_gate_with_proxy
