splitpatch(1)                     2025-08-10                     splitpatch(1)


NAME
       splitpatch - split a patch up into files or hunks

SYNOPSIS
         splitpatch [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Divide a patch or diff file into pieces. The split can made by file or
       by hunk basis. This makes is possible to separate changes that might
       not be desirable, or assemble a patch into more coherent set of
       changes.

       The hunk option makes it possible to compare similar patches on a hunk-
       by-hunk basis using a tool like interdiff(1) from the patchutils
       package.

OPTIONS
       -H, --hunk, --hunks
           Split patch by hunks instead of the default: by file.

       -f, --fullname
           Use the full path of filenames to determine the patch filename.

       -h, --help
           Display help and exit

       -V, --version
           Output version information and exit.

EXAMPLES
       Have you ever been working on code, gone off on a side tangent and then
       realized you don't have a patch for the original issue you set out to
       address?  When you run "diff -u" or some other diff command, you
       discover that you have made multiple sets of changes; some you want to
       submit, others you don't. What you really want to do is break those
       changes apart and apply only the ones you want. This is where
       splitpatch comes into play, breaking up the patch by source file:

           splitpatch changes.patch

       Or to split the patch file into individual hunks which can later be
       applied using the patch(1) command:

           splitpatch --hunks changes.patch

ENVIRONMENT
       None.

FILES
       The --hunk option writes sequentially numbered files in the current
       directory named for the source file to be patched followed by the
       sequence number: "*-NNN.patch".

       Otherwise, the split patch files are named by the source file being
       patched.

STANDARDS
       None.
