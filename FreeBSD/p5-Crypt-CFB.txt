NAME
       Crypt::CFB - Encrypt Data in Cipher Feedback Mode

SYNOPSIS
               use Crypt::CFB;

               my $cipher = new Crypt::CFB $key, 'Crypt::Rijndael';

               ## Or:
               my $iv = ''; map { $iv .= chr(rand(256)) } (0..16);
               my $cipher = new Crypt::CFB $key, 'Crypt::Rijndael', $iv;

               my $ciphertext = $cipher->encrypt($plaintext);
               my $plaintext = $cipher->decrypt($ciphertext);

               my $cipher2 = new Crypt::CFB $key, 'Digest::MD5';

               $ciphertext = $cipher->encrypt($plaintext);
               $plaintext = $cipher->decrypt($ciphertext);

DESCRIPTION
       Generic CFB implementation in pure Perl.  The Cipher Feedback Mode
       module constructs a stream cipher from a block cipher or cryptographic
       hash funtion and returns it as an object. Any block cipher in the
       "Crypt::" class can be used, as long as it supports the "blocksize" and
       "keysize" methods. Any hash function in the "Digest::" class can be
       used, as long as it supports the "add" method.

METHODS
       "$cipher = new Crypt::CFB $key, $algorithm, $optional_iv"
           Constructs a CFB object. If $algorithm is a block cipher, then $key
           should be of the correct size for that cipher. In most cases you
           can inquire the block cipher module by invoking the "keysize"
           method. If $algorithm is a hash function ("Digest::"), then $key
           can be of any size.  The optional IV can be used to further seed
           the crypto algorithm.  If no IV is given, a string of zeroes is
           used.

       "$ciphertext = $cipher->encrypt $plaintext"
           Encrypts $plaintext. The input is XORed with the keystream
           generated from the internal state of the CFB object and that state
           is updated with the output. $plaintext can be of any length.

       "$cipher->reset"
           Resets the internal state. Remember to do that before decrypting,
           if you use the same object.

       "$plaintext = $cipher->decrypt $ciphertext"
           Decrypts $ciphertext.

BUGS
       This is awfully slow. Some classes in "Digest::" do not provide the
       "add" method, so they will fail. The implementation is a little
       baroque.
