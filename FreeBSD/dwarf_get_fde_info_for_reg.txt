DWARF_GET_FDE_INFO_FOR_REG(3)                 FreeBSD Library Functions Manual

NAME
     dwarf_get_fde_info_for_reg – retrieve register rule

LIBRARY
     DWARF Access Library (libdwarf, -ldwarf)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <libdwarf.h>

     int
     dwarf_get_fde_info_for_reg(Dwarf_Fde fde, Dwarf_Half table_column,
         Dwarf_Addr pc, Dwarf_Signed *offset_relevant,
         Dwarf_Signed *register_num, Dwarf_Signed *offset, Dwarf_Addr *row_pc,
         Dwarf_Error *error);

DESCRIPTION
     Function dwarf_get_fde_info_for_reg() retrieves a register rule from the
     register rule table associated with a given FDE descriptor, given a
     program counter address and rule column number.

     Argument fde should reference a valid DWARF FDE descriptor.

     Arugment table_column should hold the column number of the register rule
     desired.

     Argument pc should hold the program counter address to be used to locate
     the desired register rule row.

     On successful execution, dwarf_get_fde_info_for_reg() stores information
     about the register rule found into the locations pointed to by the
     arguments offset_relevant, register_num, offset and row_pc.

     If there is an offset value associated with the register rule, the
     location pointed to by argument offset_relevant will be set to 1.

     Argument register_num should point to a location which will hold the
     register number associated with the register rule.

     Argument offset should point to a location which will be set to the
     offset value associated with the register rule, or to 0 if the register
     rule does not have an offset value.

     Argument row_pc should point to a location which will be set to the
     lowest program counter address associated with the register rule found.

     If argument err is not NULL, it will be used to return an error
     descriptor in case of an error.

   COMPATIBILITY
     Function dwarf_get_fde_info_for_reg() is deprecated since it only
     supports DWARF2 frame sections.  Applications should instead use function
     dwarf_get_fde_info_for_reg3(3) which supports both DWARF2 and DWARF3
     frame sections.

RETURN VALUES
     Function dwarf_get_fde_info_for_reg() returns DW_DLV_OK when it succeeds.
     In case of an error, it returns DW_DLV_ERROR and sets the argument err.

ERRORS
     Function dwarf_get_fde_info_for_reg() can fail with:

     [DW_DLE_ARGUMENT]                  One of the arguments fde,
                                        offset_relevant, register_num, offset
                                        or row_pc was NULL.

     [DW_DLE_FRAME_TABLE_COL_BAD]       The column number provided in argument
                                        table_column was too large.

     [DW_DLE_PC_NOT_IN_FDE_RANGE]       The program counter value provided in
                                        argument pc did not fall in the range
                                        covered by argument fde.
