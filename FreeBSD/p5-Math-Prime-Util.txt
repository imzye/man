SYNOPSIS
         # Nothing is exported by default.  List the functions, or use :all.
         use Math::Prime::Util ':all';  # import all functions

         # The ':rand' tag replaces srand and rand (not done by default)
         use Math::Prime::Util ':rand';  # import srand, rand, irand, irand64

DESCRIPTION
       A module for number theory in Perl.  This includes prime sieving,
       primality tests, primality proofs, integer factoring, counts / bounds /
       approximations for primes, nth primes, and twin primes, random prime
       generation, and much more.

       This module is the fastest on CPAN for almost all operations it
       supports.  This includes Math::Prime::XS, Math::Prime::FastSieve,
       Math::Factor::XS, Math::Prime::TiedArray, Math::Big::Factors,
       Math::Factoring, and Math::Primality (when the GMP module is
       available).  For numbers in the 10-20 digit range, it is often orders
       of magnitude faster.  Typically it is faster than Math::Pari for 64-bit
       operations.

       All operations support both Perl UV's (32-bit or 64-bit) and bignums.
       If you want high performance with big numbers (larger than Perl's
       native 32-bit or 64-bit size), you should install
       Math::Prime::Util::GMP and Math::BigInt::GMP.  This will be a recurring
       theme throughout this documentation -- while all bignum operations are
       supported in pure Perl, most methods will be much slower than the C+GMP
       alternative.

       The module is thread-safe and allows concurrency between Perl threads
       while still sharing a prime cache.  It is not itself multi-threaded.
       See the Limitations section if you are using Win32 and threads in your
       program.  Also note that Math::Pari is not thread-safe (and will crash
       as soon as it is loaded in threads), so if you use Math::BigInt::Pari
       rather than Math::BigInt::GMP or the default backend, things will go
       pear-shaped.

       Two scripts are also included and installed by default:

       •   primes.pl displays primes between start and end values or
           expressions, with many options for filtering (e.g. twin, safe,
           circular, good, lucky, etc.).  Use "--help" to see all the options.

       •   factor.pl operates similar to the GNU "factor" program.  It
           supports bigint and expression inputs.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       There are two environment variables that affect operation.  These are
       typically used for validation of the different methods or to simulate
       systems that have different support.

   MPU_NO_XS
       If set to 1 then everything is run in pure Perl.  No C functions are
       loaded or used, as XSLoader is not even called.  All top-level XS
       functions are replaced by a pure Perl layer (the PPFE.pm module that
       supplies a "Pure Perl Front End").

       Caveat: This does not change whether the GMP backend is used.  For as
       much pure Perl as possible, you will need to set both variables.

       If this variable is not set or set to anything other than 1, the module
       operates normally.

   MPU_NO_GMP
       If set to 1 then the Math::Prime::Util::GMP backend is not loaded, and
       operation will be exactly as if it was not installed.

       If this variable is not set or set to anything other than 1, the module
       operates normally.

BIGNUM SUPPORT
       By default all functions support bignums.  For performance, you should
       install and use Math::BigInt::GMP or Math::BigInt::Pari, and
       Math::Prime::Util::GMP.

       If you are using bigints, here are some performance suggestions:

       •   Install a recent version of Math::Prime::Util::GMP, as that will
           vastly increase the speed of many of the functions.  This does
           require the GMP <http://gmplib.org> library be installed on your
           system, but this increasingly comes pre-installed or easily
           available using the OS vendor package installation tool.

       •   Install and use Math::BigInt::GMP or Math::BigInt::Pari, then use
           "use bigint try => 'GMP,Pari'" in your script, or on the command
           line "-Mbigint=lib,GMP".  Large modular exponentiation is much
           faster using the GMP or Pari backends, as are the math and
           approximation functions when called with very large inputs.

       •   I have run these functions on many versions of Perl, and my
           experience is that if you're using anything older than Perl 5.14, I
           would recommend you upgrade if you are using bignums a lot.  There
           are some brittle behaviors on 5.12.4 and earlier with bignums.  For
           example, the default BigInt backend in older versions of Perl will
           sometimes convert small results to doubles, resulting in corrupted
           output.

PRIMALITY TESTING
       This module provides three functions for general primality testing, as
       well as numerous specialized functions.  The three main functions are:
       "is_prob_prime" and "is_prime" for general use, and "is_provable_prime"
       for proofs.  For inputs below "2^64" the functions are identical and
       fast deterministic testing is performed.  That is, the results will
       always be correct and should take at most a few microseconds for any
       input.  This is hundreds to thousands of times faster than other CPAN
       modules.  For inputs larger than "2^64", an extra-strong BPSW test
       <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baillie-PSW_primality_test> is used.  See
       the "PRIMALITY TESTING NOTES" section for more discussion.

FUNCTIONS
   is_prime
         print "$n is prime" if is_prime($n);

       Returns 0 is the number is composite, 1 if it is probably prime, and 2
       if it is definitely prime.  For numbers smaller than "2^64" it will
       only return 0 (composite) or 2 (definitely prime), as this range has
       been exhaustively tested and has no counterexamples.  For larger
       numbers, an extra-strong BPSW test is used.  If Math::Prime::Util::GMP
       is installed, some additional primality tests are also performed, and a
       quick attempt is made to perform a primality proof, so it will return 2
       for many other inputs.

       Also see the "is_prob_prime" function, which will never do additional
       tests, and the "is_provable_prime" function which will construct a
       proof that the input is number prime and returns 2 for almost all
       primes (at the expense of speed).

       For native precision numbers (anything smaller than "2^64", all three
       functions are identical and use a deterministic set of tests (selected
       Miller-Rabin bases or BPSW).  For larger inputs both "is_prob_prime"
       and "is_prime" return probable prime results using the extra-strong
       Baillie-PSW test, which has had no counterexample found since it was
       published in 1980.

       For cryptographic key generation, you may want even more testing for
       probable primes (NIST recommends some additional M-R tests).  This can
       be done using a different test (e.g.
       "is_frobenius_underwood_pseudoprime") or using additional M-R tests
       with random bases with "miller_rabin_random".  Even better, make sure
       Math::Prime::Util::GMP is installed and use "is_provable_prime" which
       should be reasonably fast for sizes under 2048 bits.  Another
       possibility is to use "random_maurer_prime" in Math::Prime::Util or
       "random_shawe_taylor_prime" in Math::Prime::Util which construct random
       provable primes.

   primes
       Returns all the primes between the lower and upper limits (inclusive),
       with a lower limit of 2 if none is given.

       An array reference is returned (with large lists this is much faster
       and uses less memory than returning an array directly).

         my $aref1 = primes( 1_000_000 );
         my $aref2 = primes( 1_000_000_000_000, 1_000_000_001_000 );

         my @primes = @{ primes( 500 ) };

         print "$_\n" for @{primes(20,100)};

       Sieving will be done if required.  The algorithm used will depend on
       the range and whether a sieve result already exists.  Possibilities
       include primality testing (for very small ranges), a Sieve of
       Eratosthenes using wheel factorization, or a segmented sieve.

   next_prime
         $n = next_prime($n);

       Returns the next prime greater than the input number.  The result will
       be a bigint if it can not be exactly represented in the native int type
       (larger than "4,294,967,291" in 32-bit Perl; larger than
       "18,446,744,073,709,551,557" in 64-bit).

   prev_prime
         $n = prev_prime($n);

       Returns the prime preceding the input number (i.e. the largest prime
       that is strictly less than the input).  "undef" is returned if the
       input is 2 or lower.

       The behavior in various programs of the previous prime function is
       varied.  Pari/GP and Math::Pari returns the input if it is prime, as
       does "nearest_le" in Math::Prime::FastSieve.  When given an input such
       that the return value will be the first prime less than 2,
       Math::Prime::FastSieve, Math::Pari, Pari/GP, and older versions of MPU
       will return 0.  Math::Primality and the current MPU will return
       "undef".  WolframAlpha returns -2.  Maple gives a range error.

   forprimes
         forprimes { say } 100,200;                  # print primes from 100 to 200

         $sum=0;  forprimes { $sum += $_ } 100000;   # sum primes to 100k

         forprimes { say if is_prime($_+2) } 10000;  # print twin primes to 10k

       Given a block and either an end count or a start and end pair, calls
       the block for each prime in the range.  Compared to getting a big array
       of primes and iterating through it, this is more memory efficient and
       perhaps more convenient.  This will almost always be the fastest way to
       loop over a range of primes.  Nesting and use in threads are allowed.

       Math::BigInt objects may be used for the range.

       For some uses an iterator ("prime_iterator", "prime_iterator_object")
       or a tied array (Math::Prime::Util::PrimeArray) may be more convenient.
       Objects can be passed to functions, and allow early loop exits.

   forcomposites
         forcomposites { say } 1000;
         forcomposites { say } 2000,2020;

       Given a block and either an end number or a start and end pair, calls
       the block for each composite in the inclusive range.  The composites,
       OEIS A002808 <http://oeis.org/A002808>, are the numbers greater than 1
       which are not prime:  "4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, ...".

   foroddcomposites
       Similar to "forcomposites", but skipping all even numbers.  The odd
       composites, OEIS A071904 <http://oeis.org/A071904>, are the numbers
       greater than 1 which are not prime and not divisible by two: "9, 15,
       21, 25, 27, 33, 35, ...".

   forsemiprimes
       Similar to "forcomposites", but only giving composites with exactly two
       factors.  The semiprimes, OEIS A001358 <http://oeis.org/A001358>, are
       the products of two primes: "4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, 25, ...".

       This is essentially equivalent to:

         forcomposites { if (is_semiprime($_)) { ... } }

   forfactored
         forfactored { say "$_: @_"; } 100;

       Given a block and either an end number or start/end pair, calls the
       block for each number in the inclusive range.  $_ is set to the number
       while @_ holds the factors.  Especially for small inputs or large
       ranges, This can be faster than calling "factor" on each sequential
       value.

       Similar to the arrays returned by similar functions such as "forpart",
       the values in @_ are read-only.  Any attempt to modify them will result
       in undefined behavior.

       This corresponds to the Pari/GP 2.10 "forfactored" function.

   forsquarefree
       Similar to "forfactored", but skipping numbers in the range that have a
       repeated factor.  Inside the block, the moebius function can be cheaply
       computed as "((scalar(@_) & 1) ? -1 : 1)" or similar.

       This corresponds to the Pari/GP 2.10 "forsquarefree" function.

   fordivisors
         fordivisors { $prod *= $_ } $n;

       Given a block and a non-negative number "n", the block is called with
       $_ set to each divisor in sorted order.  Also see "divisor_sum".

   forpart
         forpart { say "@_" } 25;           # unrestricted partitions
         forpart { say "@_" } 25,{n=>5}     # ... with exactly 5 values
         forpart { say "@_" } 25,{nmax=>5}  # ... with <=5 values

       Given a non-negative number "n", the block is called with @_ set to the
       array of additive integer partitions.  The operation is very similar to
       the "forpart" function in Pari/GP 2.6.x, though the ordering is
       different.  The ordering is lexicographic.  Use "partitions" to get
       just the count of unrestricted partitions.

       An optional hash reference may be given to produce restricted
       partitions.  Each value must be a non-negative integer.  The allowable
       keys are:

         n       restrict to exactly this many values
         amin    all elements must be at least this value
         amax    all elements must be at most this value
         nmin    the array must have at least this many values
         nmax    the array must have at most this many values
         prime   all elements must be prime (non-zero) or non-prime (zero)

       Like forcomb and forperm, the partition return values are read-only.
       Any attempt to modify them will result in undefined behavior.

   forcomp
       Similar to "forpart", but iterates over integer compositions rather
       than partitions.  This can be thought of as all ordering of partitions,
       or alternately partitions may be viewed as an ordered subset of
       compositions.  The ordering is lexicographic.  All options from
       "forpart" may be used.

       The number of unrestricted compositions of "n" is "2^(n-1)".

   forcomb
       Given non-negative arguments "n" and "k", the block is called with @_
       set to the "k" element array of values from 0 to "n-1" representing the
       combinations in lexicographical order.  While the binomial function
       gives the total number, this function can be used to enumerate the
       choices.

       Rather than give a data array as input, an integer is used for "n".  A
       convenient way to map to array elements is:

         forcomb { say "@data[@_]" } @data, 3;

       where the block maps the combination array @_ to array values, the
       argument for "n" is given the array since it will be evaluated as a
       scalar and hence give the size, and the argument for "k" is the desired
       size of the combinations.

       Like forpart and forperm, the index return values are read-only.  Any
       attempt to modify them will result in undefined behavior.

       If the second argument "k" is not supplied, then all k-subsets are
       returned starting with the smallest set "k=0" and continuing to "k=n".
       Each k-subset is in lexicographical order.  This is the power set of
       "n".

       This corresponds to the Pari/GP 2.10 "forsubset" function.

   forperm
       Given non-negative argument "n", the block is called with @_ set to the
       "k" element array of values from 0 to "n-1" representing permutations
       in lexicographical order.  The total number of calls will be "n!".

       Rather than give a data array as input, an integer is used for "n".  A
       convenient way to map to array elements is:

         forperm { say "@data[@_]" } @data;

       where the block maps the permutation array @_ to array values, and the
       argument for "n" is given the array since it will be evaluated as a
       scalar and hence give the size.

       Like forpart and forcomb, the index return values are read-only.  Any
       attempt to modify them will result in undefined behavior.

   forderange
       Similar to forperm, but iterates over derangements.  This is the set of
       permutations skipping any which maps an element to its original
       position.

   formultiperm
         # Show all anagrams of 'serpent':
         formultiperm { say join("",@_) } [split(//,"serpent")];

       Similar to "forperm" but takes an array reference as an argument.  This
       is treated as a multiset, and the block will be called with each
       multiset permutation.  While the standard permutation iterator takes a
       scalar and returns index permutations, this takes the set itself.

       If all values are unique, then the results will be the same as a
       standard permutation.  Otherwise, the results will be similar to a
       standard permutation removing duplicate entries.  While generating all
       permutations and filtering out duplicates works, it is very slow for
       large sets.  This iterator will be much more efficient.

       There is no ordering requirement for the input array reference.  The
       results will be in lexicographic order.

   forsetproduct
         forsetproduct { say "@_" } [1,2,3],[qw/a b c/],[qw/@ $ !/];

       Takes zero or more array references as arguments and iterates over the
       set product (i.e. Cartesian product or cross product) of the lists.
       The given subroutine is repeatedly called with @_ set to the current
       list.  Since no de-duplication is done, this is not literally a "set"
       product.

       While zero or one array references are valid, the result is not very
       interesting.  If any array reference is empty, the product is empty, so
       no subroutine calls are performed.

       The subroutine is given an array whose values are aliased to the
       inputs, and are not set to read-only.  Hence modifying the array inside
       the subroutine will cause side-effects.

       As with other iterators, the "lastfor" function will cause an early
       exit.

   lastfor
         forprimes { lastfor,return if $_ > 1000; $sum += $_; } 1e9;

       Calling lastfor requests that the current for... loop stop after this
       call.  Ideally this would act exactly like a "last" inside a loop, but
       technical reasons mean it does not exit the block early, hence one
       typically adds a "return" if needed.

   prime_iterator
         my $it = prime_iterator;
         $sum += $it->() for 1..100000;

       Returns a closure-style iterator.  The start value defaults to the
       first prime (2) but an initial value may be given as an argument, which
       will result in the first value returned being the next prime greater
       than or equal to the argument.  For example, this:

         my $it = prime_iterator(200);  say $it->();  say $it->();

       will return 211 followed by 223, as those are the next primes >= 200.
       On each call, the iterator returns the current value and increments to
       the next prime.

       Other options include "forprimes" (more efficiency, less flexibility),
       Math::Prime::Util::PrimeIterator (an iterator with more functionality),
       or Math::Prime::Util::PrimeArray (a tied array).

   prime_iterator_object
         my $it = prime_iterator_object;
         while ($it->value < 100) { say $it->value; $it->next; }
         $sum += $it->iterate for 1..100000;

       Returns a Math::Prime::Util::PrimeIterator object.  A shortcut that
       loads the package if needed, calls new, and returns the object.  See
       the documentation for that package for details.  This object has more
       features than the simple one above (e.g. the iterator is bi-
       directional), and also handles iterating across bigints.

   prime_count
         my $primepi = prime_count( 1_000 );
         my $pirange = prime_count( 1_000, 10_000 );

       Returns the Prime Count function Pi(n), also called "primepi" in some
       math packages.  When given two arguments, it returns the inclusive
       count of primes between the ranges.  E.g. "(13,17)" returns 2,
       "(14,17)" and "(13,16)" return 1, "(14,16)" returns 0.

       The current implementation decides based on the ranges whether to use a
       segmented sieve with a fast bit count, or the extended LMO algorithm.
       The former is preferred for small sizes as well as small ranges.  The
       latter is much faster for large ranges.

       The segmented sieve is very memory efficient and is quite fast even
       with large base values.  Its complexity is approximately "O(sqrt(a) +
       (b-a))", where the first term is typically negligible below "~ 10^11".
       Memory use is proportional only to sqrt(a), with total memory use under
       1MB for any base under "10^14".

       The extended LMO method has complexity approximately "O(b^(2/3)) +
       O(a^(2/3))", and also uses low memory.  A calculation of Pi(10^14)
       completes in a few seconds, Pi(10^15) in well under a minute, and
       Pi(10^16) in about one minute.  In contrast, even parallel primesieve
       would take over a week on a similar machine to determine Pi(10^16).

       Also see the function "prime_count_approx" which gives a very good
       approximation to the prime count, and "prime_count_lower" and
       "prime_count_upper" which give tight bounds to the actual prime count.
       These functions return quickly for any input, including bigints.

   prime_count_upper
   prime_count_lower
         my $lower_limit = prime_count_lower($n);
         my $upper_limit = prime_count_upper($n);
         #   $lower_limit  <=  prime_count(n)  <=  $upper_limit

       Returns an upper or lower bound on the number of primes below the input
       number.  These are analytical routines, so will take a fixed amount of
       time and no memory.  The actual "prime_count" will always be equal to
       or between these numbers.

       A common place these would be used is sizing an array to hold the first
       $n primes.  It may be desirable to use a bit more memory than is
       necessary, to avoid calling "prime_count".

       These routines use verified tight limits below a range at least "2^35".
       For larger inputs various methods are used including Dusart (2010),
       Büthe (2014,2015), and Axler (2014).  These bounds do not assume the
       Riemann Hypothesis.  If the configuration option "assume_rh" has been
       set (it is off by default), then the Schoenfeld (1976) bounds can be
       used for very large values.

   prime_count_approx
         print "there are about ",
               prime_count_approx( 10 ** 18 ),
               " primes below one quintillion.\n";

       Returns an approximation to the "prime_count" function, without having
       to generate any primes.  For values under "10^36" this uses the Riemann
       R function, which is quite accurate: an error of less than "0.0005%" is
       typical for input values over "2^32", and decreases as the input gets
       larger.

       A slightly faster but much less accurate answer can be obtained by
       averaging the upper and lower bounds.

   twin_primes
       Returns the lesser of twin primes between the lower and upper limits
       (inclusive), with a lower limit of 2 if none is given.  This is OEIS
       A001359 <http://oeis.org/A001359>.  Given a twin prime pair "(p,q)"
       with "q = p + 2", "p prime", and <q prime>, this function uses "p" to
       represent the pair.  Hence the bounds need to include "p", and the
       returned list will have "p" but not "q".

       This works just like the "primes" function, though only the first
       primes of twin prime pairs are returned.  Like that function, an array
       reference is returned.

   twin_prime_count
       Similar to prime count, but returns the count of twin primes (primes
       "p" where "p+2" is also prime).  Takes either a single number
       indicating a count from 2 to the argument, or two numbers indicating a
       range.

       The primes being counted are the first value, so a range of "(3,5)"
       will return a count of two, because both 3 and 5 are counted as twin
       primes.  A range of "(12,13)" will return a count of zero, because
       neither "12+2" nor "13+2" are prime.  In contrast, "primesieve"
       requires all elements of a constellation to be within the range to be
       counted, so would return one for the first example (5 is not counted
       because its pair 7 is not in the range).

       There is no useful formula known for this, unlike prime counts.  We
       sieve for the answer, using some small table acceleration.

   twin_prime_count_approx
       Returns an approximation to the twin prime count of "n".  This returns
       quickly and has a very small error for large values.  The method used
       is conjecture B of Hardy and Littlewood 1922, as stated in Sebah and
       Gourdon 2002.  For inputs under 10M, a correction factor is
       additionally applied to reduce the mean squared error.

   semi_primes
       Returns an array reference to semiprimes between the lower and upper
       limits (inclusive), with a lower limit of 4 if none is given.  This is
       OEIS A001358 <http://oeis.org/A001358>.  The semiprimes are composite
       integers which are products of exactly two primes.

       This works just like the "primes" function.  Like that function, an
       array reference is returned.

   semiprime_count
       Similar to prime count, but returns the count of semiprimes (composites
       with exactly two factors).  Takes either a single number indicating a
       count from 2 to the argument, or two numbers indicating a range.

       A fast method that requires computation only to the square root of the
       range end is used, unless the range is so small that walking it is
       faster.

   semiprime_count_approx
       Returns an approximation to the semiprime count of "n".  This returns
       quickly and is typically square root accurate.

   ramanujan_primes
       Returns the Ramanujan primes R_n between the upper and lower limits
       (inclusive), with a lower limit of 2 if none is given.  This is OEIS
       A104272 <http://oeis.org/A104272>.  These are the Rn such that if "x >
       Rn" then "prime_count"(n) - "prime_count"(n/2) >= "n".

       This has a similar API to the "primes" and "twin_primes" functions, and
       like them, returns an array reference.

       Generating Ramanujan primes takes some effort, including overhead to
       cover a range.  This will be substantially slower than generating
       standard primes.

   ramanujan_prime_count
       Similar to prime count, but returns the count of Ramanujan primes.
       Takes either a single number indicating a count from 2 to the argument,
       or two numbers indicating a range.

       While not nearly as efficient as prime_count, this does use a number of
       speedups that result it in being much more efficient than generating
       all the Ramanujan primes.

   ramanujan_prime_count_approx
       A fast approximation of the count of Ramanujan primes under "n".

   ramanujan_prime_count_lower
       A fast lower limit on the count of Ramanujan primes under "n".

   ramanujan_prime_count_upper
       A fast upper limit on the count of Ramanujan primes under "n".

   sieve_range
         my @candidates = sieve_range(2**1000, 10000, 40000);

       Given a start value "n", and native unsigned integers "width" and
       "depth", a sieve of maximum depth "depth" is done for the "width"
       consecutive numbers beginning with "n".  An array of offsets from the
       start is returned.

       The returned list contains those offsets in the range "n" to
       "n+width-1" where "n + offset" has no prime factors less than "depth".

   sieve_prime_cluster
         my @s = sieve_prime_cluster(1, 1e9, 2,6,8,12,18,20);

       Efficiently finds prime clusters between the first two arguments "low"
       and "high".  The remaining arguments describe the cluster.  The cluster
       values must be even, less than 31 bits, and strictly increasing.  Given
       a cluster set "C", the returned values are all primes in the range
       where "p+c" is prime for each "c" in the cluster set "C".  For returned
       values under "2^64", all cluster values are definitely prime.  Above
       this range, all cluster values are BPSW probable primes (no
       counterexamples known).

       This function returns an array rather than an array reference.
       Typically the number of returned values is much lower than for other
       primes functions, so this uses the more convenient array return.  This
       function has an identical signature to the function of the same name in
       Math::Prime::Util:GMP.

       The cluster is described as offsets from 0, with the implicit prime at
       0.  Hence an empty list is asking for all primes (the cluster "p+0").
       A list with the single value 2 will find all twin primes (the cluster
       where "p+0" and "p+2" are prime).  The list "2,6,8" will find prime
       quadruplets.  Note that there is no requirement that the list denote a
       constellation (a cluster with minimal distance) -- the list "42,92,606"
       is just fine.

   sum_primes
       Returns the summation of primes between the lower and upper limits
       (inclusive), with a lower limit of 2 if none is given.  This is
       essentially similar to either of:

           $sum = 0; forprimes { $sum += $_ } $low,$high;  $sum;
           # or
           vecsum( @{ primes($low,$high) } );

       but is much more efficient.

       The current implementation is a small-table-enhanced sieve count for
       sums that fit in a UV, an efficient sieve count for small ranges, and a
       Legendre sum method for larger values.

       While this is fairly efficient, the state of the art is Kim Walisch's
       primesum <https://github.com/kimwalisch/primesum>.  It is recommended
       for very large values, as it can be hundreds of times faster.

   print_primes
         print_primes(1_000_000);             # print the first 1 million primes
         print_primes(1000, 2000);            # print primes in range
         print_primes(2,1000,fileno(STDERR))  # print to a different descriptor

       With a single argument this prints all primes from 2 to "n" to standard
       out.  With two arguments it prints primes between "low" and "high" to
       standard output.  With three arguments it prints primes between "low"
       and "high" to the file descriptor given.  If the file descriptor cannot
       be written to, this will croak with "print_primes write error".  It
       will produce identical output to:

           forprimes { say } $low,$high;

       The point of this function is just efficiency.  It is over 10x faster
       than using "say", "print", or "printf", though much more limited in
       functionality.  A later version may allow a file handle as the third
       argument.

   nth_prime
         say "The ten thousandth prime is ", nth_prime(10_000);

       Returns the prime that lies in index "n" in the array of prime numbers.
       Put another way, this returns the smallest "p" such that "Pi(p) >= n".

       Like most programs with similar functionality, this is one-based.
       nth_prime(0) returns "undef", nth_prime(1) returns 2.

       For relatively small inputs (below 1 million or so), this does a sieve
       over a range containing the nth prime, then counts up to the number.
       This is fairly efficient in time and memory.  For larger values, create
       a low-biased estimate using the inverse logarithmic integral, use a
       fast prime count, then sieve in the small difference.

       While this method is thousands of times faster than generating primes,
       and doesn't involve big tables of precomputed values, it still can take
       a fair amount of time for large inputs.  Calculating the "10^12th"
       prime takes about 1 second, the "10^13th" prime takes under 10 seconds,
       and the "10^14th" prime (3475385758524527) takes under 30 seconds.
       Think about whether a bound or approximation would be acceptable, as
       they can be computed analytically.

       If the result is larger than a native integer size (32-bit or 64-bit),
       the result will take a very long time.  A later version of
       Math::Prime::Util::GMP may include this functionality which would help
       for 32-bit machines.

   nth_prime_upper
   nth_prime_lower
         my $lower_limit = nth_prime_lower($n);
         my $upper_limit = nth_prime_upper($n);
         # For all $n:   $lower_limit  <=  nth_prime($n)  <=  $upper_limit

       Returns an analytical upper or lower bound on the Nth prime.  No
       sieving is done, so these are fast even for large inputs.

       For tiny values of "n". exact answers are returned.  For small inputs,
       an inverse of the opposite prime count bound is used.  For larger
       values, the Dusart (2010) and Axler (2013) bounds are used.

   nth_prime_approx
         say "The one trillionth prime is ~ ", nth_prime_approx(10**12);

       Returns an approximation to the "nth_prime" function, without having to
       generate any primes.  For values where the nth prime is smaller than
       "2^64", the inverse Riemann R function is used.  For larger values, the
       inverse logarithmic integral is used.

       The value returned will not necessarily be prime.  This applies to all
       the following nth prime approximations, where the returned value is
       close to the real value, but no effort is made to coerce the result to
       the nearest set element.

   nth_twin_prime
       Returns the Nth twin prime.  This is done via sieving and counting, so
       is not very fast for large values.

   nth_twin_prime_approx
       Returns an approximation to the Nth twin prime.  A curve fit is used
       for small inputs (under 1200), while for larger inputs a binary search
       is done on the approximate twin prime count.

   nth_semiprime
       Returns the Nth semiprime, similar to where a "forsemiprimes" loop
       would end after "N" iterations, but much more efficiently.

   nth_semiprime_approx
       Returns an approximation to the Nth semiprime.  Curve fitting is used
       to get a fairly close approximation that is orders of magnitude better
       than the simple "n log n / log log n" approximation for large "n".

   nth_ramanujan_prime
       Returns the Nth Ramanujan prime.  For reasonable size values of "n",
       e.g.  under "10^8" or so, this is relatively efficient for single
       calls.  If multiple calls are being made, it will be much more
       efficient to get the list once.

   nth_ramanujan_prime_approx
       A fast approximation of the Nth Ramanujan prime.

   nth_ramanujan_prime_lower
       A fast lower limit on the Nth Ramanujan prime.

   nth_ramanujan_prime_upper
       A fast upper limit on the Nth Ramanujan prime.

   is_pseudoprime
       Takes a positive number "n" and one or more non-zero positive bases as
       input.  Returns 1 if the input is a probable prime to each base, 0 if
       not.  This is the simple Fermat primality test.  Removing primes, given
       base 2 this produces the sequence OEIS A001567
       <http://oeis.org/A001567>.

       For practical use, "is_strong_pseudoprime" is a much stronger test with
       similar or better performance.

       Note that there is a set of composites (the Carmichael numbers) that
       will pass this test for all bases.  This downside is not shared by the
       Euler and strong probable prime tests (also called the Solovay-Strassen
       and Miller-Rabin tests).

   is_euler_pseudoprime
       Takes a positive number "n" and one or more non-zero positive bases as
       input.  Returns 1 if the input is an Euler probable prime to each base,
       0 if not.  This is the Euler test, sometimes called the Euler-Jacobi
       test.  Removing primes, given base 2 this produces the sequence OEIS
       A047713 <http://oeis.org/A047713>.

       If 0 is returned, then the number really is a composite.  If 1 is
       returned, then it is either a prime or an Euler pseudoprime to all the
       given bases.  Given enough distinct bases, the chances become very high
       that the number is actually prime.

       This test forms the basis of the Solovay-Strassen test, which is a
       precursor to the Miller-Rabin test (which uses the strong probable
       prime test).  There are no analogies to the Carmichael numbers for this
       test.  For the Euler test, at most 1/2 of witnesses pass for a
       composite, while at most 1/4 pass for the strong pseudoprime test.

   is_strong_pseudoprime
         my $maybe_prime = is_strong_pseudoprime($n, 2);
         my $probably_prime = is_strong_pseudoprime($n, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17);

       Takes a positive number "n" and one or more non-zero positive bases as
       input.  Returns 1 if the input is a strong probable prime to each base,
       0 if not.

       If 0 is returned, then the number really is a composite.  If 1 is
       returned, then it is either a prime or a strong pseudoprime to all the
       given bases.  Given enough distinct bases, the chances become very,
       very high that the number is actually prime.

       This is usually used in combination with other tests to make either
       stronger tests (e.g. the strong BPSW test) or deterministic results for
       numbers less than some verified limit (e.g. it has long been known that
       no more than three selected bases are required to give correct
       primality test results for any 32-bit number).  Given the small chances
       of passing multiple bases, there are some math packages that just use
       multiple MR tests for primality testing.

       Even inputs other than 2 will always return 0 (composite).  While the
       algorithm does run with even input, most sources define it only on odd
       input.  Returning composite for all non-2 even input makes the function
       match most other implementations including Math::Primality's
       "is_strong_pseudoprime" function.

   is_lucas_pseudoprime
       Takes a positive number as input, and returns 1 if the input is a
       standard Lucas probable prime using the Selfridge method of choosing D,
       P, and Q (some sources call this a Lucas-Selfridge pseudoprime).
       Removing primes, this produces the sequence OEIS A217120
       <http://oeis.org/A217120>.

   is_strong_lucas_pseudoprime
       Takes a positive number as input, and returns 1 if the input is a
       strong Lucas probable prime using the Selfridge method of choosing D,
       P, and Q (some sources call this a strong Lucas-Selfridge pseudoprime).
       This is one half of the BPSW primality test (the Miller-Rabin strong
       pseudoprime test with base 2 being the other half).  Removing primes,
       this produces the sequence OEIS A217255 <http://oeis.org/A217255>.

   is_extra_strong_lucas_pseudoprime
       Takes a positive number as input, and returns 1 if the input passes the
       extra strong Lucas test (as defined in Grantham 2000
       <http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1680879>).  This test has
       more stringent conditions than the strong Lucas test, and produces
       about 60% fewer pseudoprimes.  Performance is typically 20-30% faster
       than the strong Lucas test.

       The parameters are selected using the Baillie-OEIS method
       <http://oeis.org/A217719> method: increment "P" from 3 until
       "jacobi(D,n) = -1".  Removing primes, this produces the sequence OEIS
       A217719 <http://oeis.org/A217719>.

   is_almost_extra_strong_lucas_pseudoprime
       This is similar to the "is_extra_strong_lucas_pseudoprime" function,
       but does not calculate "U", so is a little faster, but also weaker.
       With the current implementations, there is little reason to prefer this
       unless trying to reproduce specific results.  The extra-strong
       implementation has been optimized to use similar features, removing
       most of the performance advantage.

       An optional second argument (an integer between 1 and 256) indicates
       the increment amount for "P" parameter selection.  The default value of
       1 yields the parameter selection described in
       "is_extra_strong_lucas_pseudoprime", creating a pseudoprime sequence
       which is a superset of the latter's pseudoprime sequence OEIS A217719
       <http://oeis.org/A217719>.  A value of 2 yields the method used by Pari
       <http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/faq.html#primetest>.

       Because the "U = 0" condition is ignored, this produces about 5% more
       pseudoprimes than the extra-strong Lucas test.  However this is still
       only 66% of the number produced by the strong Lucas-Selfridge test.  No
       BPSW counterexamples have been found with any of the Lucas tests
       described.

   is_euler_plumb_pseudoprime
       Takes a positive number "n" as input and returns 1 if "n" passes Colin
       Plumb's Euler Criterion primality test.  Pseudoprimes to this test are
       a subset of the base 2 Fermat and Euler tests, but a superset of the
       base 2 strong pseudoprime (Miller-Rabin) test.

       The main reason for this test is that is a bit more efficient than
       other probable prime tests.

   is_perrin_pseudoprime
       Takes a positive number "n" as input and returns 1 if "n" divides P(n)
       where P(n) is the Perrin number of "n".  The Perrin sequence is defined
       by "P(n) = P(n-2) + P(n-3)" with "P(0) = 3, P(1) = 0, P(2) = 2".

       While pseudoprimes are relatively rare (the first two are 271441 and
       904631), infinitely many exist.  They have significant overlap with the
       base-2 pseudoprimes and strong pseudoprimes, making the test inferior
       to the Lucas or Frobenius tests for combined testing.  The pseudoprime
       sequence is OEIS A013998 <http://oeis.org/A013998>.

       The implementation uses modular pre-filters, Montgomery math, and the
       Adams/Shanks doubling method.  This is significantly more efficient
       than other known implementations.

       An optional second argument "r" indicates whether to run additional
       tests.  With "r=1", "P(-n) = -1 mod n" is also verified, creating the
       "minimal restricted" test.  With "r=2", the full signature is also
       tested using the Adams and Shanks (1982) rules (without the quadratic
       form test).  With "r=3", the full signature is testing using the
       Grantham (2000) test, which additionally does not allow pseudoprimes to
       be divisible by 2 or 23.  The minimal restricted pseudoprime sequence
       is OEIS A018187 <http://oeis.org/A018187>.

   is_catalan_pseudoprime
       Takes a positive number "n" as input and returns 1 if "-1^((n-1/2))
       C_((n-1/2)" is congruent to 2 mod "n", where "C_n" is the nth Catalan
       number.  The nth Catalan number is equal to "binomial(2n,n)/(n+1)".
       All odd primes satisfy this condition, and only three known composites.

       The pseudoprime sequence is OEIS A163209 <http://oeis.org/A163209>.

       There is no known efficient method to perform the Catalan primality
       test, so it is a curiosity rather than a practical test.  The
       implementation uses a method from Charles Greathouse IV (2015) and
       results from Aebi and Cairns (2008) to produce results many orders of
       magnitude faster than other known implementations, but it is still
       vastly slower than other compositeness tests.

   is_frobenius_pseudoprime
       Takes a positive number "n" as input, and two optional parameters "a"
       and "b", and returns 1 if the "n" is a Frobenius probable prime with
       respect to the polynomial "x^2 - ax + b".  Without the parameters, "b =
       2" and "a" is the least positive odd number such that "(a^2-4b|n) =
       -1".  This selection has no pseudoprimes below "2^64" and none known.
       In any case, the discriminant "a^2-4b" must not be a perfect square.

       Some authors use the Fibonacci polynomial "x^2-x-1" corresponding to
       "(1,-1)" as the default method for a Frobenius probable prime test.
       This creates a weaker test than most other parameter choices (e.g. over
       twenty times more pseudoprimes than "(3,-5)"), so is not used as the
       default here.  With the "(1,-1)" parameters the pseudoprime sequence is
       OEIS A212424 <http://oeis.org/A212424>.

       The Frobenius test is a stronger test than the Lucas test.  Any
       Frobenius "(a,b)" pseudoprime is also a Lucas "(a,b)" pseudoprime but
       the converse is not true, as any Frobenius "(a,b)" pseudoprime is also
       a Fermat pseudoprime to the base "|b|".  We can see that with the
       default parameters this is similar to, but somewhat weaker than, the
       BPSW test used by this module (which uses the strong and extra-strong
       versions of the probable prime and Lucas tests respectively).

       Also see the more efficient "is_frobenius_khashin_pseudoprime" and
       "is_frobenius_underwood_pseudoprime" which have no known
       counterexamples and run quite a bit faster.

   is_frobenius_underwood_pseudoprime
       Takes a positive number as input, and returns 1 if the input passes the
       efficient Frobenius test of Paul Underwood.  This selects a parameter
       "a" as the least non-negative integer such that "(a^2-4|n)=-1", then
       verifies that "(x+2)^(n+1) = 2a + 5 mod (x^2-ax+1,n)".  This combines a
       Fermat and Lucas test with a cost of only slightly more than 2 strong
       pseudoprime tests.  This makes it similar to, but faster than, a
       regular Frobenius test.

       There are no known pseudoprimes to this test and extensive computation
       has shown no counterexamples under "2^50".  This test also has no
       overlap with the BPSW test, making it a very effective method for
       adding additional certainty.  Performance at 1e12 is about 60% slower
       than BPSW.

   is_frobenius_khashin_pseudoprime
       Takes a positive number as input, and returns 1 if the input passes the
       Frobenius test of Sergey Khashin.  This ensures "n" is not a perfect
       square, selects the parameter "c" as the smallest odd prime such that
       "(c|n)=-1", then verifies that "(1+D)^n = (1-D) mod n" where "D =
       sqrt(c) mod n".

       There are no known pseudoprimes to this test and Khashin (2018) shows
       there are no counterexamples under "2^64".  Performance at 1e12 is
       about 40% slower than BPSW.

   miller_rabin_random
       Takes a positive number ("n") as input and a positive number ("k") of
       bases to use.  Performs "k" Miller-Rabin tests using uniform random
       bases between 2 and "n-2".

       This should not be used in place of "is_prob_prime", "is_prime", or
       "is_provable_prime".  Those functions will be faster and provide better
       results than running "k" Miller-Rabin tests.  This function can be used
       if one wants more assurances for non-proven primes, such as for
       cryptographic uses where the size is large enough that proven primes
       are not desired.

   is_prob_prime
         my $prob_prime = is_prob_prime($n);
         # Returns 0 (composite), 2 (prime), or 1 (probably prime)

       Takes a positive number as input and returns back either 0 (composite),
       2 (definitely prime), or 1 (probably prime).

       For 64-bit input (native or bignum), this uses either a deterministic
       set of Miller-Rabin tests (1, 2, or 3 tests) or a strong BPSW test
       consisting of a single base-2 strong probable prime test followed by a
       strong Lucas test.  This has been verified with Jan Feitsma's 2-PSP
       database to produce no false results for 64-bit inputs.  Hence the
       result will always be 0 (composite) or 2 (prime).

       For inputs larger than "2^64", an extra-strong Baillie-PSW primality
       test is performed (also called BPSW or BSW).  This is a probabilistic
       test, so only 0 (composite) and 1 (probably prime) are returned.  There
       is a possibility that composites may be returned marked prime, but
       since the test was published in 1980, not a single BPSW pseudoprime has
       been found, so it is extremely likely to be prime.  While we believe
       (Pomerance 1984) that an infinite number of counterexamples exist,
       there is a weak conjecture (Martin) that none exist under 10000 digits.

   is_bpsw_prime
       Given a positive number input, returns 0 (composite), 2 (definitely
       prime), or 1 (probably prime), using the BPSW primality test (extra-
       strong variant).  Normally one of the "is_prime" in Math::Prime::Util
       or "is_prob_prime" in Math::Prime::Util functions will suffice, but
       those functions do pre-tests to find easy composites.  If you know this
       is not necessary, then calling "is_bpsw_prime" may save a small amount
       of time.

   is_provable_prime
         say "$n is definitely prime" if is_provable_prime($n) == 2;

       Takes a positive number as input and returns back either 0 (composite),
       2 (definitely prime), or 1 (probably prime).  This gives it the same
       return values as "is_prime" and "is_prob_prime".  Note that numbers
       below 2^64 are considered proven by the deterministic set of Miller-
       Rabin bases or the BPSW test.  Both of these have been tested for all
       small (64-bit) composites and do not return false positives.

       Using the Math::Prime::Util::GMP module is highly recommended for doing
       primality proofs, as it is much, much faster.  The pure Perl code is
       just not fast for this type of operation, nor does it have the best
       algorithms.  It should suffice for proofs of up to 40 digit primes,
       while the latest MPU::GMP works for primes of hundreds of digits
       (thousands with an optional larger polynomial set).

       The pure Perl implementation uses theorem 5 of BLS75 (Brillhart,
       Lehmer, and Selfridge's 1975 paper), an improvement on the Pocklington-
       Lehmer test.  This requires "n-1" to be factored to "(n/2)^(1/3))".
       This is often fast, but as "n" gets larger, it takes exponentially
       longer to find factors.

       Math::Prime::Util::GMP implements both the BLS75 theorem 5 test as well
       as ECPP (elliptic curve primality proving).  It will typically try a
       quick "n-1" proof before using ECPP.  Certificates are available with
       either method.  This results in proofs of 200-digit primes in under 1
       second on average, and many hundreds of digits are possible.  This
       makes it significantly faster than Pari 2.1.7's "is_prime(n,1)" which
       is the default for Math::Pari.

   prime_certificate
         my $cert = prime_certificate($n);
         say verify_prime($cert) ? "proven prime" : "not prime";

       Given a positive integer "n" as input, returns a primality certificate
       as a multi-line string.  If we could not prove "n" prime, an empty
       string is returned ("n" may or may not be composite).  This may be
       examined or given to "verify_prime" for verification.  The latter
       function contains the description of the format.

   is_provable_prime_with_cert
       Given a positive integer as input, returns a two element array
       containing the result of "is_provable_prime":
         0  definitely composite
         1  probably prime
         2  definitely prime and a primality certificate like
       "prime_certificate".  The certificate will be an empty string if the
       first element is not 2.

   verify_prime
         my $cert = prime_certificate($n);
         say verify_prime($cert) ? "proven prime" : "not prime";

       Given a primality certificate, returns either 0 (not verified) or 1
       (verified).  Most computations are done using pure Perl with
       Math::BigInt, so you probably want to install and use
       Math::BigInt::GMP, and ECPP certificates will be faster with
       Math::Prime::Util::GMP for its elliptic curve computations.

       If the certificate is malformed, the routine will carp a warning in
       addition to returning 0.  If the "verbose" option is set (see
       "prime_set_config") then if the validation fails, the reason for the
       failure is printed in addition to returning 0.  If the "verbose" option
       is set to 2 or higher, then a message indicating success and the
       certificate type is also printed.

       A certificate may have arbitrary text before the beginning (the
       primality routines from this module will not have any extra text, but
       this way verbose output from the prover can be safely stored in a
       certificate).  The certificate begins with the line:

         [MPU - Primality Certificate]

       All lines in the certificate beginning with "#" are treated as comments
       and ignored, as are blank lines.  A version number may follow, such as:

         Version 1.0

       For all inputs, base 10 is the default, but at any point this may be
       changed with a line like:

         Base 16

       where allowed bases are 10, 16, and 62.  This module will only use base
       10, so its routines will not output Base commands.

       Next, we look for (using "100003" as an example):

         Proof for:
         N 100003

       where the text "Proof for:" indicates we will read an "N" value.
       Skipping comments and blank lines, the next line should be "N "
       followed by the number.

       After this, we read one or more blocks.  Each block is a proof of the
       form:

         If Q is prime, then N is prime.

       Some of the blocks have more than one Q value associated with them, but
       most only have one.  Each block has its own set of conditions which
       must be verified, and this can be done completely self-contained.  That
       is, each block is independent of the other blocks and may be processed
       in any order.  To be a complete proof, each block must successfully
       verify.  The block types and their conditions are shown below.

       Finally, when all blocks have been read and verified, we must ensure we
       can construct a proof tree from the set of blocks.  The root of the
       tree is the initial "N", and for each node (block), all "Q" values must
       either have a block using that value as its "N" or "Q" must be less
       than "2^64" and pass BPSW.

       Some other certificate formats (e.g. Primo) use an ordered chain, where
       the first block must be for the initial "N", a single "Q" is given
       which is the implied "N" for the next block, and so on.  This
       simplifies validation implementation somewhat, and removes some
       redundant information from the certificate, but has no obvious way to
       add proof types such as Lucas or the various BLS75 theorems that use
       multiple factors.  I decided that the most general solution was to have
       the certificate contain the set in any order, and let the verifier do
       the work of constructing the tree.

       The blocks begin with the text "Type ..." where ... is the type.  One
       or more values follow.  The defined types are:

       "Small"
             Type Small
             N 5791

           N must be less than 2^64 and be prime (use BPSW or deterministic
           M-R).

           An elliptic curve primality block, typically generated with an
           Atkin/Morain ECPP implementation, but this should be adequate for
           anything using the Atkin-Goldwasser-Kilian-Morain style
           certificates.  Some basic elliptic curve math is needed for these.
           This block verifies if:

             .  Note: A and B are allowed to be negative, with -1 not uncommon.
             .  Let A = A % N

   is_aks_prime
         say "$n is definitely prime" if is_aks_prime($n);

       Takes a non-negative number as input, and returns 1 if the input passes
       the Agrawal-Kayal-Saxena (AKS) primality test.  This is a deterministic
       unconditional primality test which runs in polynomial time for general
       input.

       While this is an important theoretical algorithm, and makes an
       interesting example, it is hard to overstate just how impractically
       slow it is in practice.  It is not used for any purpose in non-
       theoretical work, as it is literally millions of times slower than
       other algorithms.  From R.P.  Brent, 2010:  "AKS is not a practical
       algorithm.  ECPP is much faster."  We have ECPP, and indeed it is much
       faster.

       This implementation uses theorem 4.1 from Bernstein (2003).  It runs
       substantially faster than the original, v6 revised paper with Lenstra
       improvements, or the late 2002 improvements of Voloch and Bornemann.
       The GMP implementation uses a binary segmentation method for modular
       polynomial multiplication (see Bernstein's 2007 Quartic paper), which
       reduces to a single scalar multiplication, at which GMP excels.
       Because of this, the GMP implementation is likely to be faster once the
       input is larger than "2^33".

   is_mersenne_prime
         say "2^607-1 (M607) is a Mersenne prime" if is_mersenne_prime(607);

       Takes a non-negative number "p" as input and returns 1 if the Mersenne
       number "2^p-1" is prime.  Since an enormous effort has gone into
       testing these, a list of known Mersenne primes is used to accelerate
       this.  Beyond the highest sequential Mersenne prime (currently
       37,156,667) this performs pretesting followed by the Lucas-Lehmer test.

       The Lucas-Lehmer test is a deterministic unconditional test that runs
       very fast compared to other primality methods for numbers of comparable
       size, and vastly faster than any known general-form primality proof
       methods.  While this test is fast, the GMP implementation is not nearly
       as fast as specialized programs such as "prime95".  Additionally, since
       we use the table for "small" numbers, testing via this function call
       will only occur for numbers with over 9.8 million digits.  At this
       size, tools such as "prime95" are greatly preferred.

   is_ramanujan_prime
       Takes a positive number "n" as input and returns back either 0 or 1,
       indicating whether "n" is a Ramanujan prime.  Numbers that can be
       produced by the functions "ramanujan_primes" and "nth_ramanujan_prime"
       will return 1, while all other numbers will return 0.

       There is no simple function for this predicate, so Ramanujan primes
       through at least "n" are generated, then a search is performed for "n".
       This is not efficient for multiple calls.

   is_power
         say "$n is a perfect square" if is_power($n, 2);
         say "$n is a perfect cube" if is_power($n, 3);
         say "$n is a ", is_power($n), "-th power";

       Given a single non-negative integer input "n", returns k if "n = r^k"
       for some integer "r > 1, k > 1", and 0 otherwise.  The k returned is
       the largest possible.  This can be used in a boolean statement to
       determine if "n" is a perfect power.

       If given two arguments "n" and "k", returns 1 if "n" is a "k-th" power,
       and 0 otherwise.  For example, if "k=2" then this detects perfect
       squares.  Setting "k=0" gives behavior like the first case (the largest
       root is found and its value is returned).

       If a third argument is present, it must be a scalar reference.  If "n"
       is a k-th power, then this will be set to the k-th root of "n".  For
       example:

         my $n = 222657534574035968;
         if (my $pow = is_power($n, 0, \my $root)) { say "$n = $root^$pow" }
         # prints:  222657534574035968 = 2948^5

       This corresponds to Pari/GP's "ispower" function with integer
       arguments.

   is_prime_power
       Given an integer input "n", returns "k" if "n = p^k" for some prime p,
       and zero otherwise.

       If a second argument is present, it must be a scalar reference.  If the
       return value is non-zero, then it will be set to "p".

       This corresponds to Pari/GP's "isprimepower" function.

   is_square
       Given a positive integer "n", returns 1 if "n" is a perfect square, 0
       otherwise.  This is identical to "is_power(n,2)".

       This corresponds to Pari/GP's "issquare" function.

   sqrtint
       Given a non-negative integer input "n", returns the integer square
       root.  For native integers, this is equal to "int(sqrt(n))".

       This corresponds to Pari/GP's "sqrtint" function.

   rootint
       Given an non-negative integer "n" and positive exponent "k", return the
       integer k-th root of "n".  This is the largest integer "r" such that
       "r^k <= n".

       If a third argument is present, it must be a scalar reference.  It will
       be set to "r^k".

       Technically if "n" is negative and "k" is odd, the root exists and is
       equal to "sign(n) * |rootint(abs(n),k)".  It was decided to follow the
       behavior of Pari/GP and Math::BigInt and disallow negative "n".

       This corresponds to Pari/GP's "sqrtnint" function.

   logint
         say "decimal digits: ", 1+logint($n, 10);
         say "digits in base 12: ", 1+logint($n, 12);
         my $be; my $e = logint(1000,2, \$be);
         say "smallest power of 2 less than 1000:  2^$e = $be";

       Given a non-zero positive integer "n" and an integer base "b" greater
       than 1, returns the largest integer "e" such that "b^e <= n".

       If a third argument is present, it must be a scalar reference.  It will
       be set to "b^e".

       This corresponds to Pari/GP's "logint" function.

   lucasu
         say "Fibonacci($_) = ", lucasu(1,-1,$_) for 0..100;

       Given integers "P", "Q", and the non-negative integer "k", computes
       "U_k" for the Lucas sequence defined by "P","Q".  These include the
       Fibonacci numbers ("1,-1"), the Pell numbers ("2,-1"), the Jacobsthal
       numbers ("1,-2"), the Mersenne numbers ("3,2"), and more.

       This corresponds to OpenPFGW's "lucasU" function and gmpy2's "lucasu"
       function.

   lucasv
         say "Lucas($_) = ", lucasv(1,-1,$_) for 0..100;

       Given integers "P", "Q", and the non-negative integer "k", computes
       "V_k" for the Lucas sequence defined by "P","Q".  These include the
       Lucas numbers ("1,-1").

       This corresponds to OpenPFGW's "lucasV" function and gmpy2's "lucasv"
       function.

   lucas_sequence
         my($U, $V, $Qk) = lucas_sequence($n, $P, $Q, $k)

       Computes "U_k", "V_k", and "Q_k" for the Lucas sequence defined by
       "P","Q", modulo "n".  The modular Lucas sequence is used in a number of
       primality tests and proofs.  The following conditions must hold: " |P|
       < n"  ; " |Q| < n"  ; " k >= 0"  ; " n >= 2".

   gcd
       Given a list of integers, returns the greatest common divisor.  This is
       often used to test for coprimality <https://oeis.org/wiki/Coprimality>.

   lcm
       Given a list of integers, returns the least common multiple.  Note that
       we follow the semantics of Mathematica, Pari, and Perl 6, re:

         lcm(0, n) = 0              Any zero in list results in zero return
         lcm(n,-m) = lcm(n, m)      We use the absolute values

   gcdext
       Given two integers "x" and "y", returns "u,v,d" such that "d =
       gcd(x,y)" and "u*x + v*y = d".  This uses the extended Euclidian
       algorithm to compute the values satisfying Bézout's Identity.

       This corresponds to Pari's "gcdext" function, which was renamed from
       "bezout" out Pari 2.6.  The results will hence match "bezout" in
       Math::Pari.

   chinese
         say chinese( [14,643], [254,419], [87,733] );  # 87041638

       Solves a system of simultaneous congruences using the Chinese Remainder
       Theorem (with extension to non-coprime moduli).  A list of "[a,n]"
       pairs are taken as input, each representing an equation "x ≡ a mod n".
       If no solution exists, "undef" is returned.  If a solution is returned,
       the modulus is equal to the lcm of all the given moduli (see "lcm".  In
       the standard case where all values of "n" are coprime, this is just the
       product.  The "n" values must be positive integers, while the "a"
       values are integers.

       Comparison to similar functions in other software:

         Math::ModInt::ChineseRemainder:
           cr_combine( mod(a1,m1), mod(a2,m2), ... )

         Pari/GP:
           chinese( [Mod(a1,m1), Mod(a2,m2), ...] )

         Mathematica:
           ChineseRemainder[{a1, a2, ...}{m1, m2, ...}]

   vecsum
         say "Totient sum 500,000: ", vecsum(euler_phi(0,500_000));

       Returns the sum of all arguments, each of which must be an integer.
       This is similar to List::Util's "sum0" in List::Util function, but has
       a very important difference.  List::Util turns all inputs into doubles
       and returns a double, which will mean incorrect results with large
       integers.  "vecsum" sums (signed) integers and returns the untruncated
       result.  Processing is done on native integers while possible.

   vecprod
         say "Totient product 5,000: ", vecprod(euler_phi(1,5_000));

       Returns the product of all arguments, each of which must be an integer.
       This is similar to List::Util's "product" in List::Util function, but
       keeps all results as integers and automatically switches to bigints if
       needed.

   vecmin
         say "Smallest Totient 100k-200k: ", vecmin(euler_phi(100_000,200_000));

       Returns the minimum of all arguments, each of which must be an integer.
       This is similar to List::Util's "min" in List::Util function, but has a
       very important difference.  List::Util turns all inputs into doubles
       and returns a double, which gives incorrect results with large
       integers.  "vecmin" validates and compares all results as integers.
       The validation step will make it a little slower than "min" in
       List::Util but this prevents accidental and unintentional use of
       floats.

   vecmax
         say "Largest Totient 100k-200k: ", vecmax(euler_phi(100_000,200_000));

       Returns the maximum of all arguments, each of which must be an integer.
       This is similar to List::Util's "max" in List::Util function, but has a
       very important difference.  List::Util turns all inputs into doubles
       and returns a double, which gives incorrect results with large
       integers.  "vecmax" validates and compares all results as integers.
       The validation step will make it a little slower than "max" in
       List::Util but this prevents accidental and unintentional use of
       floats.

   vecreduce
         say "Count of non-zero elements: ", vecreduce { $a + !!$b } (0,@v);
         my $checksum = vecreduce { $a ^ $b } @{twin_primes(1000000)};

       Does a reduce operation via left fold.  Takes a block and a list as
       arguments.  The block uses the special local variables "a" and "b"
       representing the accumulation and next element respectively, with the
       result of the block being used for the new accumulation.  No initial
       element is used, so "undef" will be returned with an empty list.

       The interface is exactly the same as "reduce" in List::Util.  This was
       done to increase portability and minimize confusion.  See chapter 7 of
       Higher Order Perl (or many other references) for a discussion of reduce
       with empty or singular-element lists.  It is often a good idea to give
       an identity element as the first list argument.

       While operations like vecmin, vecmax, vecsum, vecprod, etc. can be
       fairly easily done with this function, it will not be as efficient.
       There are a wide variety of other functions that can be easily made
       with reduce, making it a useful tool.

   vecany
   vecall
   vecnone
   vecnotall
   vecfirst
         say "all values are Carmichael" if vecall { is_carmichael($_) } @n;

       Short circuit evaluations of a block over a list.  Takes a block and a
       list as arguments.  The block is called with $_ set to each list
       element, and evaluation on list elements is done until either all list
       values have been evaluated or the result condition can be determined.
       For instance, in the example of "vecall" above, evaluation stops as
       soon as any value returns false.

       The interface is exactly the same as the "any", "all", "none",
       "notall", and "first" functions in List::Util.  This was done to
       increase portability and minimize confusion.  Unlike other vector
       functions like "vecmax", "vecmax", "vecsum", etc. there is no added
       value to using these versus the ones from List::Util.  They are here
       for convenience.

       These operations can fairly easily be mapped to "scalar(grep {...}
       @n)", but that does not short-circuit and is less obvious.

   vecfirstidx
         say "first Carmichael is index ", vecfirstidx { is_carmichael($_) } @n;

       Returns the index of the first element in a list that evaluates to
       true.  Just like vecfirst, but returns the index instead of the value.
       Returns -1 if the item could not be found.

       This interface matches "firstidx" and "first_index" from
       List::MoreUtils.

   vecextract
         say "Power set: ", join(" ",vecextract(\@v,$_)) for 0..2**scalar(@v)-1;
         @word = vecextract(["a".."z"], [15, 17, 8, 12, 4]);

       Extracts elements from an array reference based on a mask, with the
       result returned as an array.  The mask is either an unsigned integer
       which is treated as a bit mask, or an array reference containing
       integer indices.

       If the second argument is an integer, each bit set in the mask results
       in the corresponding element from the array reference to be returned.
       Bits are read from the right, so a mask of 1 returns the first element,
       while 5 will return the first and third.  The mask may be a bigint.

       If the second argument is an array reference, then its elements will be
       used as zero-based indices into the first array.  Duplicate values are
       allowed and the ordering is preserved.  Hence these are equivalent:

           vecextract($aref, $iref);
           @$aref[@$iref];

   todigits
         say "product of digits of n: ", vecprod(todigits($n));

       Given an integer "n", return an array of digits of "|n|".  An optional
       second integer argument specifies a base (default 10).  For example,
       given a base of 2, this returns an array of binary digits of "n".  An
       optional third argument specifies a length for the returned array.  The
       result will be either have upper digits truncated or have leading zeros
       added.  This is most often used with base 2, 8, or 16.

       The values returned may be read-only.  todigits(0) returns an empty
       array.  The base must be at least 2, and is limited to an int.  Length
       must be at least zero and is limited to an int.

       This corresponds to Pari's "digits" and "binary" functions, and
       Mathematica's "IntegerDigits" function.

   todigitstring
         say "decimal 456 in hex is ", todigitstring(456, 16);
         say "last 4 bits of $n are: ", todigitstring($n, 2, 4);

       Similar to "todigits" but returns a string.  For bases <= 10, this is
       equivalent to joining the array returned by "todigits".  For bases
       between 11 and 36, lower case characters "a" to "z" are used to
       represent larger values.  This makes "todigitstring($n,16)" return a
       usable hex string.

       This corresponds to Mathematica's "IntegerString" function.

   fromdigits
         say "hex 1c8 in decimal is ", fromdigits("1c8", 16);
         say "Base 3 array to number is: ", fromdigits([0,1,2,2,2,1,0],3);

       This takes either a string or array reference, and an optional base
       (default 10).  With a string, each character will be interpreted as a
       digit in the given base, with both upper and lower case denoting values
       11 through 36.  With an array reference, the values indicate the
       entries in that location, and values larger than the base are allowed
       (results are carried).  The result is a number (either a native integer
       or a bigint).

       This corresponds to Pari's "fromdigits" function and Mathematica's
       "FromDigits" function.

   sumdigits
         # Sum digits of primes to 1 million.
         my $s=0; forprimes { $s += sumdigits($_); } 1e6; say $s;

       Given an input "n", return the sum of the digits of "n".  Any non-digit
       characters of "n" are ignored (including negative signs and decimal
       points).  This is similar to the command "vecsum(split(//,$n))" but
       faster, allows non-positive-integer inputs, and can sum in other bases.

       An optional second argument indicates the base of the input number.
       This defaults to 10, and must be between 2 and 36.  Any character that
       is outside the range 0 to "base-1" will be ignored.

       If no base is given and the input number "n" begins with "0x" or "0b"
       then it will be interpreted as a string in base 16 or 2 respectively.

       Regardless of the base, the output sum is a decimal number.

       This is similar but not identical to Pari's "sumdigits" function from
       version 2.8 and later.  The Pari/GP function always takes the input as
       a decimal number, uses the optional base as a base to first convert to,
       then sums the digits.  This can be done with either
       "vecsum(todigits($n, $base))" or "sumdigits(todigitstring($n,$base))".

   invmod
         say "The inverse of 42 mod 2017 = ", invmod(42,2017);

       Given two integers "a" and "n", return the inverse of "a" modulo "n".
       If not defined, undef is returned.  If defined, then the return value
       multiplied by "a" equals 1 modulo "n".

       The results correspond to the Pari result of "lift(Mod(1/a,n))".  The
       semantics with respect to negative arguments match Pari.  Notably, a
       negative "n" is negated, which is different from Math::BigInt, but in
       both cases the return value is still congruent to 1 modulo "n" as
       expected.

   sqrtmod
       Given two integers "a" and "n", return the square root of "a" mod "n".
       If no square root exists, undef is returned.  If defined, the return
       value "r" will always satisfy "r^2 = a mod n".

       If the modulus is prime, the function will always return "r", the
       smaller of the two square roots (the other being "-r mod p".  If the
       modulus is composite, one of possibly many square roots will be
       returned, and it will not necessarily be the smallest.

   addmod
       Given three integers "a", "b", and "n" where "n" is positive, return
       "(a+b) mod n".  This is particularly useful when dealing with numbers
       that are larger than a half-word but still native size.  No bigint
       package is needed and this can be 10-200x faster than using one.

   mulmod
       Given three integers "a", "b", and "n" where "n" is positive, return
       "(a*b) mod n".  This is particularly useful when "n" fits in a native
       integer.  No bigint package is needed and this can be 10-200x faster
       than using one.

   powmod
       Given three integers "a", "b", and "n" where "n" is positive, return
       "(a ** b) mod n".  Typically binary exponentiation is used, so the
       process is very efficient.  With native size inputs, no bigint library
       is needed.

   divmod
       Given three integers "a", "b", and "n" where "n" is positive, return
       "(a/b) mod n".  This is done as "(a * (1/b mod n)) mod n".  If no
       inverse of "b" mod "n" exists then undef if returned.

   valuation
         say "$n is divisible by 2 ", valuation($n,2), " times.";

       Given integers "n" and "k", returns the numbers of times "n" is
       divisible by "k".  This is a very limited version of the algebraic
       valuation meaning, just applied to integers.  This corresponds to
       Pari's "valuation" function.  0 is returned if "n" or "k" is one of the
       values -1, 0, or 1.

   hammingweight
       Given an integer "n", returns the binary Hamming weight of abs(n).
       This is also called the population count, and is the number of 1s in
       the binary representation.  This corresponds to Pari's "hammingweight"
       function for "t_INT" arguments.

   is_square_free
         say "$n has no repeating factors" if is_square_free($n);

       Returns 1 if the input "n" has no repeated factor.

   is_carmichael
         for (1..1e6) { say if is_carmichael($_) } # Carmichaels under 1,000,000

       Returns 1 if the input "n" is a Carmichael number.  These are
       composites that satisfy "b^(n-1) ≡ 1 mod n" for all "1 < b < n"
       relatively prime to "n".  Alternately Korselt's theorem says these are
       composites such that "n" is square-free and "p-1" divides "n-1" for all
       prime divisors "p" of "n".

       For inputs larger than 50 digits after removing very small factors,
       this uses a probabilistic test since factoring the number could take
       unreasonably long.  The first 150 primes are used for testing.  Any
       that divide "n" are checked for square-free-ness and the Korselt
       condition, while those that do not divide "n" are used as the
       pseudoprime base.  The chances of a non-Carmichael passing this test
       are less than "2^-150".

       This is the OEIS series A002997 <http://oeis.org/A002997>.

   is_quasi_carmichael
       Returns 0 if the input "n" is not a quasi-Carmichael number, and the
       number of bases otherwise.  These are square-free composites that
       satisfy "p+b" divides "n+b" for all prime factors "p" or "n" and for
       one or more non-zero integer "b".

       This is the OEIS series A257750 <http://oeis.org/A257750>.

   is_semiprime
       Given a positive integer "n", returns 1 if "n" is a semiprime, 0
       otherwise.  A semiprime is the product of exactly two primes.

       The boolean result is the same as "scalar(factor(n)) == 2", but this
       function performs shortcuts that can greatly speed up the operation.

   is_fundamental
       Given an integer "d", returns 1 if "d" is a fundamental discriminant, 0
       otherwise.  We consider 1 to be a fundamental discriminant.

       This is the OEIS series A003658 <http://oeis.org/A003658> (positive)
       and OEIS series A003657 <http://oeis.org/A003657> (negative).

       This corresponds to Pari's "isfundamental" function.

   is_totient
       Given an integer "n", returns 1 if there exists an integer "x" where
       "euler_phi(x) == n".

       This corresponds to Pari's "istotient" function, though without the
       optional second argument to return an "x".  Math::NumSeq::Totient also
       has a similar function.

       Also see "inverse_totient" which gives the count or list of values that
       produce a given totient.  This function is more efficient than getting
       the full count or list.

   is_pillai
       Given a positive integer "n", if there exists a "v" where "v! % n ==
       n-1" and "n % v != 1", then "v" is returned.  Otherwise 0.

       For n prime, this is the OEIS series A063980 <http://oeis.org/A063980>.

   is_polygonal
       Given integers "x" and "s", return 1 if x is an s-gonal number, 0
       otherwise.  "s" must be greater than 2.

       If a third argument is present, it must be a scalar reference.  It will
       be set to n if x is the nth s-gonal number.  If the function returns 0,
       then it will be unchanged.

       This corresponds to Pari's "ispolygonal" function.

   moebius
         say "$n is square free" if moebius($n) != 0;
         $sum += moebius($_) for (1..200); say "Mertens(200) = $sum";
         say "Mertens(2000) = ", vecsum(moebius(0,2000));

       Returns μ(n), the Möbius function (also known as the Moebius, Mobius,
       or MoebiusMu function) for an integer input.  This function is 1 if "n
       = 1", 0 if "n" is not square-free (i.e. "n" has a repeated factor), and
       "-1^t" if "n" is a product of "t" distinct primes.  This is an
       important function in prime number theory.  Like SAGE, we define
       "moebius(0) = 0" for convenience.

       If called with two arguments, they define a range "low" to "high", and
       the function returns an array with the value of the Möbius function for
       every n from low to high inclusive.  Large values of high will result
       in a lot of memory use.  The algorithm used for ranges is Deléglise and
       Rivat (1996) algorithm 4.1, which is a segmented version of Lioen and
       van de Lune (1994) algorithm 3.2.

       The return values are read-only constants.  This should almost never
       come up, but it means trying to modify aliased return values will cause
       an exception (modifying the returned scalar or array is fine).

   mertens
         say "Mertens(10M) = ", mertens(10_000_000);   # = 1037

       Returns M(n), the Mertens function for a non-negative integer input.
       This function is defined as "sum(moebius(1..n))", but calculated more
       efficiently for large inputs.  For example, computing Mertens(100M)
       takes:

          time    approx mem
            0.4s      0.1MB   mertens(100_000_000)
            3.0s    880MB     vecsum(moebius(1,100_000_000))
           56s        0MB     $sum += moebius($_) for 1..100_000_000

       The summation of individual terms via factoring is quite expensive in
       time, though uses O(1) space.  Using the range version of moebius is
       much faster, but returns a 100M element array which, even though they
       are shared constants, is not good for memory at this size.  In
       comparison, this function will generate the equivalent output via a
       sieving method that is relatively memory frugal and very fast.  The
       current method is a simple "n^1/2" version of Deléglise and Rivat
       (1996), which involves calculating all moebius values to "n^1/2", which
       in turn will require prime sieving to "n^1/4".

       Various algorithms exist for this, using differing quantities of μ(n).
       The simplest way is to efficiently sum all "n" values.  Benito and
       Varona (2008) show a clever and simple method that only requires "n/3"
       values.  Deléglise and Rivat (1996) describe a segmented method using
       only "n^1/3" values.  The current implementation does a simple non-
       segmented "n^1/2" version of their method.  Kuznetsov (2011) gives an
       alternate method that he indicates is even faster.  Lastly, one of the
       advanced prime count algorithms could be theoretically used to create a
       faster solution.

   euler_phi
         say "The Euler totient of $n is ", euler_phi($n);

       Returns φ(n), the Euler totient function (also called Euler's phi or
       phi function) for an integer value.  This is an arithmetic function
       which counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to "n"
       that are relatively prime to "n".

       Given the definition used, "euler_phi" will return 0 for all "n < 1".
       This follows the logic used by SAGE.  Mathematica and Pari return
       euler_phi(-n) for "n < 0".  Mathematica returns 0 for "n = 0", Pari
       pre-2.6.2 raises an exception, and Pari 2.6.2 and newer returns 2.

       If called with two arguments, they define a range "low" to "high", and
       the function returns a list with the totient of every n from low to
       high inclusive.

   inverse_totient
       In array context, given a positive integer "n", returns the complete
       list of values "x" where "euler_phi(x) = n".  This can be a memory
       intensive operation if there are many values.

       In scalar context, returns just the count of values.  This is faster
       and uses substantially less memory.  The list/scalar distinction is
       similar to "factor" and "divisors".

       This roughly corresponds to the Maple function "InverseTotient", and
       the hidden Mathematica function "EulerPhiInverse".  The algorithm used
       is from Max Alekseyev (2016).

   jordan_totient
         say "Jordan's totient J_$k($n) is ", jordan_totient($k, $n);

       Returns Jordan's totient function for a given integer value.  Jordan's
       totient is a generalization of Euler's totient, where
         "jordan_totient(1,$n) == euler_totient($n)" This counts the number of
       k-tuples less than or equal to n that form a coprime tuple with n.  As
       with "euler_phi", 0 is returned for all "n < 1".  This function can be
       used to generate some other useful functions, such as the Dedekind psi
       function, where "psi(n) = J(2,n) / J(1,n)".

   ramanujan_sum
       Returns Ramanujan's sum of the two positive variables "k" and "n".
       This is the sum of the nth powers of the primitive k-th roots of unity.

   exp_mangoldt
         say "exp(lambda($_)) = ", exp_mangoldt($_) for 1 .. 100;

       Returns EXP(Λ(n)), the exponential of the Mangoldt function (also known
       as von Mangoldt's function) for an integer value.  The Mangoldt
       function is equal to log p if n is prime or a power of a prime, and 0
       otherwise.  We return the exponential so all results are integers.
       Hence the return value for "exp_mangoldt" is:

          p   if n = p^m for some prime p and integer m >= 1
          1   otherwise.

   liouville
       Returns λ(n), the Liouville function for a non-negative integer input.
       This is -1 raised to Ω(n) (the total number of prime factors).

   chebyshev_theta
         say chebyshev_theta(10000);

       Returns θ(n), the first Chebyshev function for a non-negative integer
       input.  This is the sum of the logarithm of each prime where "p <= n".
       This is effectively:

         my $s = 0;  forprimes { $s += log($_) } $n;  return $s;

   chebyshev_psi
         say chebyshev_psi(10000);

       Returns ψ(n), the second Chebyshev function for a non-negative integer
       input.  This is the sum of the logarithm of each prime power where "p^k
       <= n" for an integer k.  An alternate but slower computation is as the
       summatory Mangoldt function, such as:

         my $s = 0;  for (1..$n) { $s += log(exp_mangoldt($_)) }  return $s;

   divisor_sum
         say "Sum of divisors of $n:", divisor_sum( $n );
         say "sigma_2($n) = ", divisor_sum($n, 2);
         say "Number of divisors: sigma_0($n) = ", divisor_sum($n, 0);

       This function takes a positive integer as input and returns the sum of
       its divisors, including 1 and itself.  An optional second argument "k"
       may be given, which will result in the sum of the "k-th" powers of the
       divisors to be returned.

       This is known as the sigma function (see Hardy and Wright section
       16.7).  The API is identical to Pari/GP's "sigma" function, and not
       dissimilar to Mathematica's "DivisorSigma[k,n]" function.  This
       function is useful for calculating things like aliquot sums, abundant
       numbers, perfect numbers, etc.

       With various "k" values, the results are the OEIS sequences OEIS series
       A000005 <http://oeis.org/A000005> ("k=0", number of divisors), OEIS
       series A000203 <http://oeis.org/A000203> ("k=1", sum of divisors), OEIS
       series A001157 <http://oeis.org/A001157> ("k=2", sum of squares of
       divisors), OEIS series A001158 <http://oeis.org/A001158> ("k=4", sum of
       cubes of divisors), etc.

       The second argument may also be a code reference, which is called for
       each divisor and the results are summed.  This allows computation of
       other functions, but will be less efficient than using the numeric
       second argument.  This corresponds to Pari/GP's "sumdiv" function.

       An example of the 5th Jordan totient (OEIS A059378):

         divisor_sum( $n, sub { my $d=shift; $d**5 * moebius($n/$d); } );

       though we have a function "jordan_totient" which is more efficient.

       For numeric second arguments (sigma computations), the result will be a
       bigint if necessary.  For the code reference case, the user must take
       care to return bigints if overflow will be a concern.

   ramanujan_tau
       Takes a positive integer as input and returns the value of Ramanujan's
       tau function.  The result is a signed integer.  This corresponds to
       Pari v2.8's "tauramanujan" function and Mathematica's "RamanujanTau"
       function.

       This currently uses a simple method based on divisor sums, which does
       not have a good computational growth rate.  Pari's implementation uses
       Hurwitz class numbers and is more efficient for large inputs.

   primorial
         $prim = primorial(11); #        11# = 2*3*5*7*11 = 2310

       Returns the primorial "n#" of the positive integer input, defined as
       the product of the prime numbers less than or equal to "n".  This is
       the OEIS series A034386 <http://oeis.org/A034386>: primorial numbers
       second definition.

         primorial(0)  == 1
         primorial($n) == pn_primorial( prime_count($n) )

       The result will be a Math::BigInt object if it is larger than the
       native bit size.

       Be careful about which version ("primorial" or "pn_primorial") matches
       the definition you want to use.  Not all sources agree on the
       terminology, though they should give a clear definition of which of the
       two versions they mean.  OEIS, Wikipedia, and Mathworld are all
       consistent, and these functions should match that terminology.  This
       function should return the same result as the "mpz_primorial_ui"
       function added in GMP 5.1.

   pn_primorial
         $prim = pn_primorial(5); #      p_5# = 2*3*5*7*11 = 2310

       Returns the primorial number "p_n#" of the positive integer input,
       defined as the product of the first "n" prime numbers (compare to the
       factorial, which is the product of the first "n" natural numbers).
       This is the OEIS series A002110 <http://oeis.org/A002110>: primorial
       numbers first definition.

         pn_primorial(0)  == 1
         pn_primorial($n) == primorial( nth_prime($n) )

       The result will be a Math::BigInt object if it is larger than the
       native bit size.

   consecutive_integer_lcm
         $lcm = consecutive_integer_lcm($n);

       Given an unsigned integer argument, returns the least common multiple
       of all integers from 1 to "n".  This can be done by manipulation of the
       primes up to "n", resulting in much faster and memory-friendly results
       than using a factorial.

   partitions
       Calculates the partition function p(n) for a non-negative integer
       input.  This is the number of ways of writing the integer n as a sum of
       positive integers, without restrictions.  This corresponds to Pari's
       "numbpart" function and Mathematica's "PartitionsP" function.  The
       values produced in order are OEIS series A000041
       <http://oeis.org/A000041>.

       This uses a combinatorial calculation, which means it will not be very
       fast compared to Pari, Mathematica, or FLINT which use the Rademacher
       formula using multi-precision floating point.  In 10 seconds:

                  70    Integer::Partition
                  90    MPU forpart { $n++ }
              10_000    MPU pure Perl partitions
             250_000    MPU GMP partitions
          35_000_000    Pari's numbpart
         500_000_000    Jonathan Bober's partitions_c.cc v0.6

       If you want the enumerated partitions, see "forpart".

   carmichael_lambda
       Returns the Carmichael function (also called the reduced totient
       function, or Carmichael λ(n)) of a positive integer argument.  It is
       the smallest positive integer "m" such that "a^m = 1 mod n" for every
       integer "a" coprime to "n".  This is OEIS series A002322
       <http://oeis.org/A002322>.

   kronecker
       Returns the Kronecker symbol "(a|n)" for two integers.  The possible
       return values with their meanings for odd prime "n" are:

          0   a = 0 mod n
          1   a is a quadratic residue mod n       (a = x^2 mod n for some x)
         -1   a is a quadratic non-residue mod n   (no a where a = x^2 mod n)

       The Kronecker symbol is an extension of the Jacobi symbol to all
       integer values of "n" from the latter's domain of positive odd values
       of "n".  The Jacobi symbol is itself an extension of the Legendre
       symbol, which is only defined for odd prime values of "n".  This
       corresponds to Pari's "kronecker(a,n)" function, Mathematica's
       "KroneckerSymbol[n,m]" function, and GMP's "mpz_kronecker(a,n)",
       "mpz_jacobi(a,n)", and "mpz_legendre(a,n)" functions.

   factorial
       Given positive integer argument "n", returns the factorial of "n",
       defined as the product of the integers 1 to "n" with the special case
       of "factorial(0) = 1".  This corresponds to Pari's factorial(n) and
       Mathematica's "Factorial[n]" functions.

   factorialmod
       Given two positive integer arguments "n" and "m", returns "n! mod m".
       This is much faster than computing the large factorial(n) followed by a
       mod operation.

       While very efficient, this is not state of the art.  Currently, Fredrik
       Johansson's fast multi-point polynomial evaluation method as used in
       FLINT is the fastest known method.  This becomes noticeable for "n" >
       "10^8" or so, and the O(n^.5) versus O(n) complexity makes it quite
       extreme as the input gets larger.

   binomial
       Given integer arguments "n" and "k", returns the binomial coefficient
       "n*(n-1)*...*(n-k+1)/k!", also known as the choose function.  Negative
       arguments use the Kronenburg extensions
       <http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.3689/>.  This corresponds to Pari's
       "binomial(n,k)" function, Mathematica's "Binomial[n,k]" function, and
       GMP's "mpz_bin_ui" function.

       For negative arguments, this matches Mathematica.  Pari does not
       implement the "n < 0, k <= n" extension and instead returns 0 for this
       case.  GMP's API does not allow negative "k" but otherwise matches.
       Math::BigInt does not implement any extensions and the results for "n <
       0, k " 0> are undefined.

   hclassno
       Returns 12 times the Hurwitz-Kronecker class number of the input
       integer "n".  This will always be an integer due to the pre-
       multiplication by 12.  The result is 0 for any input less than zero or
       congruent to 1 or 2 mod 4.

       This is related to Pari's qfbhclassno(n) where hclassno(n) for positive
       "n" equals "12 * qfbhclassno(n)" in Pari/GP.  This is OEIS A259825
       <http://oeis.org/A259825>.

   bernfrac
       Returns the Bernoulli number "B_n" for an integer argument "n", as a
       rational number represented by two Math::BigInt objects.  B_1 = 1/2.
       This corresponds to Pari's bernfrac(n) and Mathematica's "BernoulliB"
       functions.

       Having a modern version of Math::Prime::Util::GMP installed will make a
       big difference in speed.  That module uses a fast Pi/Zeta method.  Our
       pure Perl backend uses the Seidel method as shown by Peter Luschny.
       This is faster than Math::Pari which uses an older algorithm, but quite
       a bit slower than modern Pari, Mathematica, or our GMP backend.

       This corresponds to Pari's "bernfrac" function and Mathematica's
       "BernoulliB" function.

   bernreal
       Returns the Bernoulli number "B_n" for an integer argument "n", as a
       Math::BigFloat object using the default precision.  An optional second
       argument may be given specifying the precision to be used.

       This corresponds to Pari's "bernreal" function.

   stirling
         say "s(14,2) = ", stirling(14, 2);
         say "S(14,2) = ", stirling(14, 2, 2);
         say "L(14,2) = ", stirling(14, 2, 3);

       Returns the Stirling numbers of either the first kind (default), the
       second kind, or the third kind (the unsigned Lah numbers), with the
       kind selected as an optional third argument.  It takes two non-negative
       integer arguments "n" and "k" plus the optional "type".  This
       corresponds to Pari's "stirling(n,k,{type})" function and Mathematica's
       "StirlingS1" / "StirlingS2" functions.

       Stirling numbers of the first kind are "-1^(n-k)" times the number of
       permutations of "n" symbols with exactly "k" cycles.  Stirling numbers
       of the second kind are the number of ways to partition a set of "n"
       elements into "k" non-empty subsets.  The Lah numbers are the number of
       ways to split a set of "n" elements into "k" non-empty lists.

   harmfrac
       Returns the Harmonic number "H_n" for an integer argument "n", as a
       rational number represented by two Math::BigInt objects.  The harmonic
       numbers are the sum of reciprocals of the first "n" natural numbers: "1
       + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n".

       Binary splitting (Fredrik Johansson's elegant formulation) is used.

       This corresponds to Mathematica's "HarmonicNumber" function.

   harmreal
       Returns the Harmonic number "H_n" for an integer argument "n", as a
       Math::BigFloat object using the default precision.  An optional second
       argument may be given specifying the precision to be used.

       For large "n" values, using a lower precision may result in faster
       computation as an asymptotic formula may be used.  For precisions of 13
       or less, native floating point is used for even more speed.

   znorder
         $order = znorder(2, next_prime(10**16)-6);

       Given two positive integers "a" and "n", returns the multiplicative
       order of "a" modulo "n".  This is the smallest positive integer "k"
       such that "a^k ≡ 1 mod n".  Returns 1 if "a = 1".  Returns undef if "a
       = 0" or if "a" and "n" are not coprime, since no value will result in 1
       mod n.

       This corresponds to Pari's "znorder(Mod(a,n))" function and
       Mathematica's "MultiplicativeOrder[a,n]" function.

   znprimroot
       Given a positive integer "n", returns the smallest primitive root of
       "(Z/nZ)^*", or "undef" if no root exists.  A root exists when
       "euler_phi($n) == carmichael_lambda($n)", which will be true for all
       prime "n" and some composites.

       OEIS A033948 <http://oeis.org/A033948> is a sequence of integers where
       the primitive root exists, while OEIS A046145 <http://oeis.org/A046145>
       is a list of the smallest primitive roots, which is what this function
       produces.

   is_primitive_root
       Given two non-negative numbers "a" and "n", returns 1 if "a" is a
       primitive root modulo "n", and 0 if not.  If "a" is a primitive root,
       then euler_phi(n) is the smallest "e" for which "a^e = 1 mod n".

   znlog
         $k = znlog($a, $g, $p)

       Returns the integer "k" that solves the equation "a = g^k mod p", or
       undef if no solution is found.  This is the discrete logarithm problem.

       The implementation for native integers first applies Silver-Pohlig-
       Hellman on the group order to possibly reduce the problem to a set of
       smaller problems.  The solutions are then performed using a mixture of
       trial, Shanks' BSGS, and Pollard's DLP Rho.

       The PP implementation is less sophisticated, with only a memory-heavy
       BSGS being used.

   legendre_phi
         $phi = legendre_phi(1000000000, 41);

       Given a non-negative integer "n" and a non-negative prime number "a",
       returns the Legendre phi function (also called Legendre's sum).  This
       is the count of positive integers <= "n" which are not divisible by any
       of the first "a" primes.

   inverse_li
         $approx_prime_count = inverse_li(1000000000);

       Given a non-negative integer "n", returns the least integer value "k"
       such that Li(k) >= n>.  Since the logarithmic integral Li(n) is a good
       approximation to the number of primes less than "n", this function is a
       good simple approximation to the nth prime.

   numtoperm
         @p = numtoperm(10,654321);  # @p=(1,8,2,7,6,5,3,4,9,0)

       Given a non-negative integer "n" and integer "k", return the rank "k"
       lexicographic permutation of "n" elements.  "k" will be interpreted as
       mod "n!".

       This will match iteration number "k" (zero based) of "forperm".

       This corresponds to Pari's "numtoperm(n,k)" function, though Pari uses
       an implementation specific ordering rather than lexicographic.

   permtonum
         $k = permtonum([1,8,2,7,6,5,3,4,9,0]);  # $k = 654321

       Given an array reference containing integers from 0 to "n", returns the
       lexicographic permutation rank of the set.  This is the inverse of the
       "numtoperm" function.  All integers up to "n" must be present.

       This will match iteration number "k" (zero based) of "forperm".  The
       result will be between 0 and "n!-1".

       This corresponds to Pari's permtonum(n) function, though Pari uses an
       implementation specific ordering rather than lexicographic.

   randperm
         @p = randperm(100);   # returns shuffled 0..99
         @p = randperm(100,4)  # returns 4 elements from shuffled 0..99
         @s = @data[randperm(1+$#data)];    # shuffle an array
         @p = @data[randperm(1+$#data,2)];  # pick 2 from an array

       With a single argument "n", this returns a random permutation of the
       values from 0 to "n-1".

       When given a second argument "k", the returned list will have only "k"
       elements.  This is more efficient than truncating the full shuffled
       list.

       The randomness comes from our CSPRNG.

   shuffle
         @shuffled = shuffle(@data);

       Takes a list as input, and returns a random permutation of the list.
       Like randperm, the randomness comes from our CSPRNG.

       This function is functionally identical to the "shuffle" function in
       List::Util.  The only difference is the random source (Chacha20 with
       better randomness, a larger period, and a larger state).  This does
       make it slower.

       If the entire shuffled array is desired, this is faster than slicing
       with "randperm" as shown in its example above.  If, however, a "pick"
       operation is desired, e.g. pick 2 random elements from a large array,
       then the slice technique can be hundreds of times faster.

RANDOM NUMBERS
   OVERVIEW
       Prior to version 5.20, Perl's "rand" function used the system rand
       function.  This meant it varied by system, and was almost always a poor
       choice.  For 5.20, Perl standardized on "drand48" and includes the
       source so there are no system dependencies.  While this was an
       improvement, "drand48" is not a good PRNG.  It really only has 32 bits
       of random values, and fails many statistical tests.  See
       <http://www.pcg-random.org/statistical-tests.html> for more
       information.

       There are much better choices for standard random number generators,
       such as the Mersenne Twister, PCG, or Xoroshiro128+.  Someday perhaps
       Perl will get one of these to replace drand48.  In the mean time,
       Math::Random::MTwist provides numerous features and excellent
       performance, or this module.

       Since we often deal with random primes for cryptographic purposes, we
       have additional requirements.  This module uses a CSPRNG for its random
       stream.  In particular, ChaCha20, which is the same algorithm used by
       BSD's "arc4random" and "/dev/urandom" on BSD and Linux 4.8+.  Seeding
       is performed at startup using the Win32 Crypto API (on Windows),
       "/dev/urandom", "/dev/random", or Crypt::PRNG, whichever is found
       first.

       We use the original ChaCha definition rather than RFC7539.  This means
       a 64-bit counter, resulting in a period of 2^72 bytes or 2^68 calls to
       drand or <irand64>.  This compares favorably to the 2^48 period of
       Perl's "drand48".  It has a 512-bit state which is significantly larger
       than the 48-bit "drand48" state.  When seeding, 320 bits (40 bytes) are
       used.  Among other things, this means all 52! permutations of a
       shuffled card deck are possible, which is not true of "shuffle" in
       List::Util.

       One might think that performance would suffer from using a CSPRNG, but
       benchmarking shows it is less than one might expect.  does not seem to
       be the case.  The speed of irand, irand64, and drand are within 20% of
       the fastest existing modules using non-CSPRNG methods, and 2 to 20
       times faster than most.  While a faster underlying RNG is useful, the
       Perl call interface overhead is a majority of the time for these calls.
       Carefully tuning that interface is critical.

       For performance on large amounts of data, see the tables in
       "random_bytes".

       Each thread uses its own context, meaning seeding in one thread has no
       impact on other threads.  In addition to improved security, this is
       better for performance than a single context with locks.  If explicit
       control of multiple independent streams are needed then using a more
       specific module is recommended.  I believe Crypt::PRNG (part of CryptX)
       and Bytes::Random::Secure are good alternatives.

       Using the ":rand" export option will define "rand" and "srand" as
       similar but improved versions of the system functions of the same name,
       as well as "irand" and "irand64".

   irand
         $n32 = irand;     # random 32-bit integer

       Returns a random 32-bit integer using the CSPRNG.

   irand64
         $n64 = irand64;   # random 64-bit integer

       Returns a random 64-bit integer using the CSPRNG (on 64-bit Perl).

   drand
         $f = drand;       # random floating point value in [0,1)
         $r = drand(25.33);   # random floating point value in [0,25.33)

       Returns a random NV (Perl's native floating point) using the CSPRNG.
       The API is similar to Perl's "rand" but giving better results.

       The number of bits returned is equal to the number of significand bits
       of the NV type used in the Perl build. By default Perl uses doubles and
       the returned values have 53 bits (even on 32-bit Perl).  If Perl is
       built with long double or quadmath support, each value may have 64 or
       even 113 bits.  On newer Perls, one can check the Config variable
       "nvmantbits" to see how many are filled.

       This gives substantially better quality random numbers than the default
       Perl "rand" function.  Among other things, on modern Perl's, "rand"
       uses drand48, which has 32 bits of not-very-good randomness and 16 more
       bits of obvious patterns (e.g. the 48th bit alternates, the 47th has a
       period of 4, etc.).  Output from "rand" fails at least 5 tests from the
       TestU01 SmallCrush suite, while our function easily passes.

       With the ":rand" tag, this function is additionally exported as "rand".

   random_bytes
         $str = random_bytes(32);     # 32 random bytes

       Given an unsigned number "n" of bytes, returns a string filled with
       random data from the CSPRNG.  Performance for large quantities:

   entropy_bytes
       Similar to random_bytes, but directly using the entropy source.  This
       is not normally recommended as it can consume shared system resources
       and is typically slow -- on the computer that produced the
       "random_bytes" chart above, using "dd" generated the same 13 MB/s
       performance as our "entropy_bytes" function.

       The actual performance will be highly system dependent.

   urandomb
         $n32 = urandomb(32);    # Classic irand32, returns a UV
         $n   = urandomb(1024);  # Random integer less than 2^1024

       Given a number of bits "b", returns a random unsigned integer less than
       "2^b".  The result will be uniformly distributed between 0 and "2^b-1"
       inclusive.

   urandomm
         $n = urandomm(100);    # random integer in [0,99]
         $n = urandomm(1024);   # random integer in [0,1023]

       Given a positive integer "n", returns a random unsigned integer less
       than "n".  The results will be uniformly distributed between 0 and
       "n-1" inclusive.  Care is taken to prevent modulo bias.

   csrand
       Takes a binary string "data" as input and seeds the internal CSPRNG.
       This is not normally needed as system entropy is used as a seed on
       startup.  For best security this should be 16-128 bytes of good
       entropy.  No more than 1024 bytes will be used.

       With no argument, reseeds using system entropy, which is preferred.

       If the "secure" configuration has been set, then this will croak if
       given an argument.  This allows for control of reseeding with entropy
       the module gets itself, but not user supplied.

   srand
       Takes a single UV argument and seeds the CSPRNG with it, as well as
       returning it.  If no argument is given, a new UV seed is constructed.
       Note that this creates a very weak seed from a cryptographic
       standpoint, so it is useful for testing or simulations but "csrand" is
       recommended, or keep using the system entropy default seed.

       The API is nearly identical to the system function "srand".  It uses a
       UV which can be 64-bit rather than always 32-bit.  The behaviour for
       "undef", empty string, empty list, etc. is slightly different (we treat
       these as 0).

       This function is not exported with the ":all" tag, but is with ":rand".

       If the "secure" configuration has been set, this function will croak.
       Manual seeding using "srand" is not compatible with cryptographic
       security.

   rand
       An alias for "drand", not exported unless the ":rand" tag is used.

   random_factored_integer
         my($n, $factors) = random_factored_integer(1000000);

       Given a positive non-zero input "n", returns a uniform random integer
       in the range 1 to "n", along with an array reference containing the
       factors.

       This uses Kalai's algorithm for generating random integers along with
       their factorization, and is much faster than the naive method of
       generating random integers followed by a factorization.  A later
       implementation may use Bach's more efficient algorithm.

RANDOM PRIMES
   random_prime
         my $small_prime = random_prime(1000);      # random prime <= limit
         my $rand_prime = random_prime(100, 10000); # random prime within a range

       Returns a pseudo-randomly selected prime that will be greater than or
       equal to the lower limit and less than or equal to the upper limit.  If
       no lower limit is given, 2 is implied.  Returns undef if no primes
       exist within the range.

       The goal is to return a uniform distribution of the primes in the
       range, meaning for each prime in the range, the chances are equally
       likely that it will be seen.  This is removes from consideration such
       algorithms as "PRIMEINC", which although efficient, gives very non-
       random output.  This also implies that the numbers will not be evenly
       distributed, since the primes are not evenly distributed.  Stated
       differently, the random prime functions return a uniformly selected
       prime from the set of primes within the range.  Hence given
       random_prime(1000), the numbers 2, 3, 487, 631, and 997 all have the
       same probability of being returned.

       For small numbers, a random index selection is done, which gives ideal
       uniformity and is very efficient with small inputs.  For ranges larger
       than this ~16-bit threshold but within the native bit size, a Monte
       Carlo method is used.  This also gives ideal uniformity and can be very
       fast for reasonably sized ranges.  For even larger numbers, we
       partition the range, choose a random partition, then select a random
       prime from the partition.  This gives some loss of uniformity but
       results in many fewer bits of randomness being consumed as well as
       being much faster.

   random_ndigit_prime
         say "My 4-digit prime number is: ", random_ndigit_prime(4);

       Selects a random n-digit prime, where the input is an integer number of
       digits.  One of the primes within that range (e.g. 1000 - 9999 for
       4-digits) will be uniformly selected.

       If the number of digits is greater than or equal to the maximum native
       type, then the result will be returned as a BigInt.  However, if the
       "nobigint" configuration option is on, then output will be restricted
       to native size numbers, and requests for more digits than natively
       supported will result in an error.  For better performance with large
       bit sizes, install Math::Prime::Util::GMP.

   random_nbit_prime
         my $bigprime = random_nbit_prime(512);

       Selects a random n-bit prime, where the input is an integer number of
       bits.  A prime with the nth bit set will be uniformly selected.

       For bit sizes of 64 and lower, "random_prime" is used, which gives
       completely uniform results in this range.  For sizes larger than 64,
       Algorithm 1 of Fouque and Tibouchi (2011) is used, wherein we select a
       random odd number for the lower bits, then loop selecting random upper
       bits until the result is prime.  This allows a more uniform
       distribution than the general "random_prime" case while running
       slightly faster (in contrast, for large bit sizes "random_prime"
       selects a random upper partition then loops on the values within the
       partition, which very slightly skews the results towards smaller
       numbers).

       The result will be a BigInt if the number of bits is greater than the
       native bit size.  For better performance with large bit sizes, install
       Math::Prime::Util::GMP.

   random_strong_prime
         my $bigprime = random_strong_prime(512);

       Constructs an n-bit strong prime using Gordon's algorithm.  We consider
       a strong prime p to be one where

       •   p is large.   This function requires at least 128 bits.

       •   p-1 has a large prime factor r.

       •   p+1 has a large prime factor s

       •   r-1 has a large prime factor t

       Using a strong prime in cryptography guards against easy factoring with
       algorithms like Pollard's Rho.  Rivest and Silverman (1999) present a
       case that using strong primes is unnecessary, and most modern
       cryptographic systems agree.  First, the smoothness does not affect
       more modern factoring methods such as ECM.  Second, modern factoring
       methods like GNFS are far faster than either method so make the point
       moot.  Third, due to key size growth and advances in factoring and
       attacks, for practical purposes, using large random primes offer
       security equivalent to strong primes.

       Similar to "random_nbit_prime", the result will be a BigInt if the
       number of bits is greater than the native bit size.  For better
       performance with large bit sizes, install Math::Prime::Util::GMP.

   random_proven_prime
         my $bigprime = random_proven_prime(512);

       Constructs an n-bit random proven prime.  Internally this may use
       "is_provable_prime"("random_nbit_prime") or "random_maurer_prime"
       depending on the platform and bit size.

   random_proven_prime_with_cert
         my($n, $cert) = random_proven_prime_with_cert(512)

       Similar to "random_proven_prime", but returns a two-element array
       containing the n-bit provable prime along with a primality certificate.
       The certificate is the same as produced by "prime_certificate" or
       "is_provable_prime_with_cert", and can be parsed by "verify_prime" or
       any other software that understands MPU primality certificates.

   random_maurer_prime
         my $bigprime = random_maurer_prime(512);

       Construct an n-bit provable prime, using the FastPrime algorithm of
       Ueli Maurer (1995).  This is the same algorithm used by Crypt::Primes.
       Similar to "random_nbit_prime", the result will be a BigInt if the
       number of bits is greater than the native bit size.

       The performance with Math::Prime::Util::GMP installed is hundreds of
       times faster, so it is highly recommended.

       The differences between this function and that in Crypt::Primes are
       described in the "SEE ALSO" section.

       Internally this additionally runs the BPSW probable prime test on every
       partial result, and constructs a primality certificate for the final
       result, which is verified.  These provide additional checks that the
       resulting value has been properly constructed.

       If you don't need absolutely proven results, then it is somewhat faster
       to use "random_nbit_prime" either by itself or with some additional
       tests, e.g.  "miller_rabin_random" and/or
       "is_frobenius_underwood_pseudoprime".  One could also run
       is_provable_prime on the result, but this will be slow.

   random_maurer_prime_with_cert
         my($n, $cert) = random_maurer_prime_with_cert(512)

       As with "random_maurer_prime", but returns a two-element array
       containing the n-bit provable prime along with a primality certificate.
       The certificate is the same as produced by "prime_certificate" or
       "is_provable_prime_with_cert", and can be parsed by "verify_prime" or
       any other software that understands MPU primality certificates.  The
       proof construction consists of a single chain of "BLS3" types.

   random_shawe_taylor_prime
         my $bigprime = random_shawe_taylor_prime(8192);

       Construct an n-bit provable prime, using the Shawe-Taylor algorithm in
       section C.6 of FIPS 186-4.  This uses 512 bits of randomness and
       SHA-256 as the hash.  This is a slightly simpler and older (1986)
       method than Maurer's 1999 construction.  It is a bit faster than
       Maurer's method, and uses less system entropy for large sizes.  The
       primary reason to use this rather than Maurer's method is to use the
       FIPS 186-4 algorithm.

       Similar to "random_nbit_prime", the result will be a BigInt if the
       number of bits is greater than the native bit size.  For better
       performance with large bit sizes, install Math::Prime::Util::GMP.  Also
       see "random_maurer_prime" and "random_proven_prime".

       Internally this additionally runs the BPSW probable prime test on every
       partial result, and constructs a primality certificate for the final
       result, which is verified.  These provide additional checks that the
       resulting value has been properly constructed.

   random_shawe_taylor_prime_with_cert
         my($n, $cert) = random_shawe_taylor_prime_with_cert(4096)

       As with "random_shawe_taylor_prime", but returns a two-element array
       containing the n-bit provable prime along with a primality certificate.
       The certificate is the same as produced by "prime_certificate" or
       "is_provable_prime_with_cert", and can be parsed by "verify_prime" or
       any other software that understands MPU primality certificates.  The
       proof construction consists of a single chain of "Pocklington" types.

   random_semiprime
       Takes a positive integer number of bits "bits", returns a random
       semiprime of exactly "bits" bits.  The result has exactly two prime
       factors (hence semiprime).

       The factors will be approximately equal size, which is typical for
       cryptographic use.  For example, a 64-bit semiprime of this type is the
       product of two 32-bit primes.  "bits" must be 4 or greater.

       Some effort is taken to select uniformly from the universe of
       "bits"-bit semiprimes.  This takes slightly longer than some methods
       that do not select uniformly.

   random_unrestricted_semiprime
       Takes a positive integer number of bits "bits", returns a random
       semiprime of exactly "bits" bits.  The result has exactly two prime
       factors (hence semiprime).

       The factors are uniformly selected from the universe of all "bits"-bit
       semiprimes.  This means semiprimes with one factor equal to 2 will be
       most common, 3 next most common, etc.  "bits" must be 3 or greater.

       Some effort is taken to select uniformly from the universe of
       "bits"-bit semiprimes.  This takes slightly longer than some methods
       that do not select uniformly.

UTILITY FUNCTIONS
   prime_precalc
         prime_precalc( 1_000_000_000 );

       Let the module prepare for fast operation up to a specific number.  It
       is not necessary to call this, but it gives you more control over when
       memory is allocated and gives faster results for multiple calls in some
       cases.  In the current implementation this will calculate a sieve for
       all numbers up to the specified number.

   prime_memfree
         prime_memfree;

       Frees any extra memory the module may have allocated.  Like with
       "prime_precalc", it is not necessary to call this, but if you're done
       making calls, or want things cleanup up, you can use this.  The object
       method might be a better choice for complicated uses.

   Math::Prime::Util::MemFree->new
         my $mf = Math::Prime::Util::MemFree->new;
         # perform operations.  When $mf goes out of scope, memory will be recovered.

       This is a more robust way of making sure any cached memory is freed, as
       it will be handled by the last "MemFree" object leaving scope.  This
       means if your routines were inside an eval that died, things will still
       get cleaned up.  If you call another function that uses a MemFree
       object, the cache will stay in place because you still have an object.

   prime_get_config
         my $cached_up_to = prime_get_config->{'precalc_to'};

       Returns a reference to a hash of the current settings.  The hash is
       copy of the configuration, so changing it has no effect.  The settings
       include:

         verbose         verbose level.  1 or more will result in extra output.
         precalc_to      primes up to this number are calculated
         maxbits         the maximum number of bits for native operations
         xs              0 or 1, indicating the XS code is available
         gmp             0 or 1, indicating GMP code is available
         maxparam        the largest value for most functions, without bigint
         maxdigits       the max digits in a number, without bigint
         maxprime        the largest representable prime, without bigint
         maxprimeidx     the index of maxprime, without bigint
         assume_rh       whether to assume the Riemann hypothesis (default 0)
         secure          disable ability to manually seed the CSPRNG

   prime_set_config
         prime_set_config( assume_rh => 1 );

       Allows setting of some parameters.  Currently the only parameters are:

         verbose      The default setting of 0 will generate no extra output.
                      Setting to 1 or higher results in extra output.  For
                      example, at setting 1 the AKS algorithm will indicate
                      the chosen r and s values.  At setting 2 it will output
                      a sequence of dots indicating progress.  Similarly, for
                      random_maurer_prime, setting 3 shows real time progress.
                      Factoring large numbers is another place where verbose
                      settings can give progress indications.

         xs           Allows turning off the XS code, forcing the Pure Perl
                      code to be used.  Set to 0 to disable XS, set to 1 to
                      re-enable.  You probably will never want to do this.

         gmp          Allows turning off the use of L<Math::Prime::Util::GMP>,
                      which means using Pure Perl code for big numbers.  Set
                      to 0 to disable GMP, set to 1 to re-enable.
                      You probably will never want to do this.

         assume_rh    Allows functions to assume the Riemann hypothesis is
                      true if set to 1.  This defaults to 0.  Currently this
                      setting only impacts prime count lower and upper
                      bounds, but could later be applied to other areas such
                      as primality testing.  A later version may also have a
                      way to indicate whether no RH, RH, GRH, or ERH is to
                      be assumed.

         secure       The CSPRNG may no longer be manually seeded.  Once set,
                      this option cannot be disabled.  L</srand> will croak
                      if called, and L</csrand> will croak if called with any
                      arguments.  L</csrand> with no arguments is still allowed,
                      as that will use system entropy without giving anything
                      to the caller.  The point of this option is to ensure that
                      any called functions do not try to control the RNG.

FACTORING FUNCTIONS
   factor
         my @factors = factor(3_369_738_766_071_892_021);
         # returns (204518747,16476429743)

       Produces the prime factors of a positive number input, in numerical
       order.  The product of the returned factors will be equal to the input.
       "n = 1" will return an empty list, and "n = 0" will return 0.  This
       matches Pari.

       In scalar context, returns Ω(n), the total number of prime factors
       (OEIS A001222 <http://oeis.org/A001222>).  This corresponds to Pari's
       bigomega(n) function and Mathematica's "PrimeOmega[n]" function.  This
       is same result that we would get if we evaluated the resulting array in
       scalar context.

       The current algorithm does a little trial division, a check for perfect
       powers, followed by combinations of Pollard's Rho, SQUFOF, and
       Pollard's p-1.  The combination is applied to each non-prime factor
       found.

       Factoring bigints works with pure Perl, and can be very handy on 32-bit
       machines for numbers just over the 32-bit limit, but it can be very
       slow for "hard" numbers.  Installing the Math::Prime::Util::GMP module
       will speed up bigint factoring a lot, and all future effort on large
       number factoring will be in that module.  If you do not have that
       module for some reason, use the GMP or Pari version of bigint if
       possible (e.g. "use bigint try => 'GMP,Pari'"), which will run 2-3x
       faster (though still 100x slower than the real GMP code).

   factor_exp
         my @factor_exponent_pairs = factor_exp(29513484000);
         # returns ([2,5], [3,4], [5,3], [7,2], [11,1], [13,2])
         # factor(29513484000)
         # returns (2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,7,7,11,13,13)

       Produces pairs of prime factors and exponents in numerical factor
       order.  This is more convenient for some algorithms.  This is the same
       form that Mathematica's "FactorInteger[n]" and Pari/GP's "factorint"
       functions return.  Note that Math::Pari transposes the Pari result
       matrix.

       In scalar context, returns ω(n), the number of unique prime factors
       (OEIS A001221 <http://oeis.org/A001221>).  This corresponds to Pari's
       omega(n) function and Mathematica's "PrimeNu[n]" function.  This is
       same result that we would get if we evaluated the resulting array in
       scalar context.

       The internals are identical to "factor", so all comments there apply.
       Just the way the factors are arranged is different.

   divisors
         my @divisors = divisors(30);   # returns (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30)

       Produces all the divisors of a positive number input, including 1 and
       the input number.  The divisors are a power set of multiplications of
       the prime factors, returned as a uniqued sorted list.  The result is
       identical to that of Pari's "divisors" and Mathematica's "Divisors[n]"
       functions.

       In scalar context this returns the sigma0 function (see Hardy and
       Wright section 16.7).  This is OEIS A000005 <http://oeis.org/A000005>.
       The results is identical to evaluating the array in scalar context, but
       more efficient.  This corresponds to Pari's "numdiv" and Mathematica's
       "DivisorSigma[0,n]" functions.

       Also see the "for_divisors" functions for looping over the divisors.

   trial_factor
         my @factors = trial_factor($n);

       Produces the prime factors of a positive number input.  The factors
       will be in numerical order.  For large inputs this will be very slow.
       Like all the specific-algorithm *_factor routines, this is not exported
       unless explicitly requested.

   fermat_factor
         my @factors = fermat_factor($n);

       Produces factors, not necessarily prime, of the positive number input.
       The particular algorithm is Knuth's algorithm C.  For small inputs this
       will be very fast, but it slows down quite rapidly as the number of
       digits increases.  It is very fast for inputs with a factor close to
       the midpoint (e.g. a semiprime p*q where p and q are the same number of
       digits).

   holf_factor
         my @factors = holf_factor($n);

       Produces factors, not necessarily prime, of the positive number input.
       An optional number of rounds can be given as a second parameter.  It is
       possible the function will be unable to find a factor, in which case a
       single element, the input, is returned.  This uses Hart's One Line
       Factorization with no premultiplier.  It is an interesting alternative
       to Fermat's algorithm, and there are some inputs it can rapidly factor.
       Overall it has the same advantages and disadvantages as Fermat's
       method.

   lehman_factor
         my @factors = lehman_factor($n);

       Produces factors, not necessarily prime, of the positive number input.
       An optional argument, defaulting to 0 (false), indicates whether to run
       trial division.  Without trial division, is possible the function will
       be unable to find a factor, in which case a single element, the input,
       is returned.

       This is Warren D. Smith's Lehman core with minor modifications.  It is
       limited to 42-bit inputs: "n < 8796393022208".

   squfof_factor
         my @factors = squfof_factor($n);

       Produces factors, not necessarily prime, of the positive number input.
       An optional number of rounds can be given as a second parameter.  It is
       possible the function will be unable to find a factor, in which case a
       single element, the input, is returned.  This function typically runs
       very fast.

   prho_factor
   pbrent_factor
         my @factors = prho_factor($n);
         my @factors = pbrent_factor($n);

         # Use a very small number of rounds
         my @factors = prho_factor($n, 1000);

       Produces factors, not necessarily prime, of the positive number input.
       An optional number of rounds can be given as a second parameter.  These
       attempt to find a single factor using Pollard's Rho algorithm, either
       the original version or Brent's modified version.  These are more
       specialized algorithms usually used for pre-factoring very large
       inputs, as they are very fast at finding small factors.

   pminus1_factor
         my @factors = pminus1_factor($n);
         my @factors = pminus1_factor($n, 1_000);          # set B1 smoothness
         my @factors = pminus1_factor($n, 1_000, 50_000);  # set B1 and B2

       Produces factors, not necessarily prime, of the positive number input.
       This is Pollard's "p-1" method, using two stages with default
       smoothness settings of 1_000_000 for B1, and "10 * B1" for B2.  This
       method can rapidly find a factor "p" of "n" where "p-1" is smooth (it
       has no large factors).

   pplus1_factor
         my @factors = pplus1_factor($n);
         my @factors = pplus1_factor($n, 1_000);          # set B1 smoothness

       Produces factors, not necessarily prime, of the positive number input.
       This is Williams' "p+1" method, using one stage and two predefined
       initial points.

   ecm_factor
         my @factors = ecm_factor($n);
         my @factors = ecm_factor($n, 100, 400, 10);      # B1, B2, # of curves

       Produces factors, not necessarily prime, of the positive number input.
       This is the elliptic curve method using two stages.

MATHEMATICAL FUNCTIONS
   ExponentialIntegral
         my $Ei = ExponentialIntegral($x);

       Given a non-zero floating point input "x", this returns the real-valued
       exponential integral of "x", defined as the integral of "e^t/t dt" from
       "-infinity" to "x".

       If the bignum module has been loaded, all inputs will be treated as if
       they were Math::BigFloat objects.

       For non-BigInt/BigFloat inputs, the result should be accurate to at
       least 14 digits.

       For BigInt / BigFloat inputs, full accuracy and performance is obtained
       only if Math::Prime::Util::GMP is installed.  If this module is not
       available, then other methods are used and give at least 14 digits of
       accuracy: continued fractions ("x < -1"), rational Chebyshev
       approximation (" -1 < x < 0"), a convergent series (small positive
       "x"), or an asymptotic divergent series (large positive "x").

   LogarithmicIntegral
         my $li = LogarithmicIntegral($x)

       Given a positive floating point input, returns the floating point
       logarithmic integral of "x", defined as the integral of "dt/ln t" from
       0 to "x".  If given a negative input, the function will croak.  The
       function returns 0 at "x = 0", and "-infinity" at "x = 1".

       This is often known as li(x).  A related function is the offset
       logarithmic integral, sometimes known as Li(x) which avoids the
       singularity at 1.  It may be defined as "Li(x) = li(x) - li(2)".
       Crandall and Pomerance use the term "li0" for this function, and define
       "li(x) = Li0(x) - li0(2)".  Due to this terminology confusion, it is
       important to check which exact definition is being used.

       If the bignum module has been loaded, all inputs will be treated as if
       they were Math::BigFloat objects.

       For non-BigInt/BigFloat objects, the result should be accurate to at
       least 14 digits.

       For BigInt / BigFloat inputs, full accuracy and performance is obtained
       only if Math::Prime::Util::GMP is installed.

   RiemannZeta
         my $z = RiemannZeta($s);

       Given a floating point input "s" where "s >= 0", returns the floating
       point value of ζ(s)-1, where ζ(s) is the Riemann zeta function.  One is
       subtracted to ensure maximum precision for large values of "s".  The
       zeta function is the sum from k=1 to infinity of "1 / k^s".  This
       function only uses real arguments, so is basically the Euler Zeta
       function.

       If the bignum module has been loaded, all inputs will be treated as if
       they were Math::BigFloat objects.

       For non-BigInt/BigFloat objects, the result should be accurate to at
       least 14 digits.  The XS code uses a rational Chebyshev approximation
       between 0.5 and 5, and a series for other values.  The PP code uses an
       identical series for all values.

       For BigInt / BigFloat inputs, full accuracy and performance is obtained
       only if Math::Prime::Util::GMP is installed.  If this module is not
       available, then other methods are used and give at least 14 digits of
       accuracy: Either Borwein (1991) algorithm 2, or the basic series.
       Math::BigFloat RT 43692
       <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=43692> can produce
       incorrect high-accuracy computations when GMP is not used.

   RiemannR
         my $r = RiemannR($x);

       Given a positive non-zero floating point input, returns the floating
       point value of Riemann's R function.  Riemann's R function gives a very
       close approximation to the prime counting function.

       If the bignum module has been loaded, all inputs will be treated as if
       they were Math::BigFloat objects.

       For non-BigInt/BigFloat objects, the result should be accurate to at
       least 14 digits.

       For BigInt / BigFloat inputs, full accuracy and performance is obtained
       only if Math::Prime::Util::GMP is installed.  If this module are not
       available, accuracy should be 35 digits.

   LambertW
       Returns the principal branch of the Lambert W function of a real value.
       Given a value "k" this solves for "W" in the equation "k = We^W".  The
       input must not be less than "-1/e".  This corresponds to Pari's
       "lambertw" function and Mathematica's "ProductLog" / "LambertW"
       function.

       This function handles all real value inputs with non-complex return
       values.  This is a superset of Pari's "lambertw" which is similar but
       only for positive arguments.  Mathematica's function is much more
       detailed, with both branches, complex arguments, and complex results.

       Calculation will be done with C long doubles if the input is a standard
       scalar, but if bignum is in use or if the input is a BigFloat type,
       then extended precision results will be used.

       Speed of the native code is about half of the fastest native code
       (Veberic's C++), and about 30x faster than Pari/GP.  However the bignum
       calculation is slower than Pari/GP.

   Pi
         my $tau = 2 * Pi;     # $tau = 6.28318530717959
         my $tau = 2 * Pi(40); # $tau = 6.283185307179586476925286766559005768394

       With no arguments, returns the value of Pi as an NV.  With a positive
       integer argument, returns the value of Pi with the requested number of
       digits (including the leading 3).  The return value will be an NV if
       the number of digits fits in an NV (typically 15 or less), or a
       Math::BigFloat object otherwise.

       For sizes over 10k digits, having either Math::Prime::Util::GMP or
       Math::BigInt::GMP installed will help performance.  For sizes over 50k
       the one is highly recommended.

         forcomposites { $nsemis++ if scalar factor($_) == 2; } int(10**8)-1;
         say $nsemis;

       Here is one of the best ways for PE187:  under 20 milliseconds from the
       command line.  Much faster than Pari, and competitive with Mathematica.

         use Math::Prime::Util qw/forprimes prime_count/;
         my $limit = shift || int(10**8);
         $limit--;
         my ($sum, $pc) = (0, 1);

           return map { [$d[$_],$d[$#d-$_]] } 1..(@d-1)>>1;
         }
         my $n = 139650;
         say "$n = ", join(" = ", map { "$_->[0]·$_->[1]" } matches($n));

       or its "matches" function with the "skip_multiples" option:

         sub matches {
           my @d = divisors(shift);
           return map { [$d[$_],$d[$#d-$_]] }
                  grep { my $div=$d[$_]; !scalar(grep {!($div % $d[$_])} 1..$_-1) }

             my $phi = euler_phi($n);
             my @r = grep { gcd($_,$n) == 1 && znorder($_,$n) == $phi } 1..$n-1;
             say "$n ", join(" ", @r);
           }
         }

       Find the 7-digit palindromic primes in the first 20k digits of Pi:

         use Math::Prime::Util qw/Pi is_prime/;
         my $pi = "".Pi(20000);  # make sure we only stringify once
         for my $pos (2 .. length($pi)-7) {
           my $s = substr($pi, $pos, 7);
           say "$s at $pos" if $s eq reverse($s) && is_prime($s);
         }

         # Or we could use the regex engine to find the palindromes:
         while ($pi =~ /(([1379])(\d)(\d)\d\4\3\2)/g) {
           say "$1 at ",pos($pi)-7 if is_prime($1)
         }

         # Using forderange directly is faster

       Compute the subfactorial of n (OEIS A000166 <http://oeis.org/A000166>):

           vecsum(map{ vecprod((-1)**($n-$_),binomial($n,$_),factorial($_)) }0..$n);
         }

       Compute subfactorial (number of derangements) using simple recursion:

         sub subfactorial { my $n = shift;
           use bigint;
           ($n < 1)  ?  1  :  $n * subfactorial($n-1) + (-1)**$n;
         }

PRIMALITY TESTING NOTES
       Above "2^64", "is_prob_prime" performs an extra-strong BPSW test
       <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baillie-PSW_primality_test> which is fast
       (a little less than the time to perform 3 Miller-Rabin tests) and has
       no known counterexamples.  If you trust the primality testing done by
       Pari, Maple, SAGE, FLINT, etc., then this function should be
       appropriate for you.  "is_prime" will do the same BPSW test as well as
       some additional testing, making it slightly more time consuming but
       less likely to produce a false result.  This is a little more stringent
       than Mathematica.  "is_provable_prime" constructs a primality proof.
       If a certificate is requested, then either BLS75 theorem 5 or ECPP is
       performed.  Without a certificate, the method is implementation
       specific (currently it is identical, but later releases may use APRCL).
       With Math::Prime::Util::GMP installed, this is quite fast through 300
       or so digits.

       Math systems 30 years ago typically used Miller-Rabin tests with "k"
       bases (usually fixed bases, sometimes random) for primality testing,
       but these have generally been replaced by some form of BPSW as used in
       this module.  See Pinch's 1993 paper for examples of why using "k" M-R
       tests leads to poor results.  The three exceptions in common
       contemporary use I am aware of are:

       libtommath
           Uses the first "k" prime bases.  This is problematic for
           cryptographic use, as there are known methods (e.g. Arnault 1994)
           for constructing counterexamples.  The number of bases required to
           avoid false results is unreasonably high, hence performance is slow
           even if one ignores counterexamples.  Unfortunately this is the
           multi-precision math library used for Perl 6 and at least one CPAN
           Crypto module.

       GMP/MPIR
           Uses a set of "k" static-random bases.  The bases are randomly
           chosen using a PRNG that is seeded identically each call (the seed
           changes with each release).  This offers a very slight advantage
           over using the first "k" prime bases, but not much.  See, for
           example, Nicely's mpz_probab_prime_p pseudoprimes
           <http://www.trnicely.net/misc/mpzspsp.html> page.

       Math::Pari (not recent Pari/GP)
           Pari 2.1.7 is the default version installed with the Math::Pari
           module.  It uses 10 random M-R bases (the PRNG uses a fixed seed
           set at compile time).  Pari 2.3.0 was released in May 2006 and it,
           like all later releases through at least 2.6.1, use BPSW / APRCL,
           after complaints of false results from using M-R tests.  For
           example, it will indicate 9 is prime about 1 out of every 276k
           calls.

       Basically the problem is that it is just too easy to get
       counterexamples from running "k" M-R tests, forcing one to use a very
       large number of tests (at least 20) to avoid frequent false results.
       Using the BPSW test results in no known counterexamples after 30+ years
       and runs much faster.  It can be enhanced with one or more random bases
       if one desires, and will still be much faster.

       Using "k" fixed bases has another problem, which is that in any
       adversarial situation we can assume the inputs will be selected such
       that they are one of our counterexamples.  Now we need absurdly large
       numbers of tests.  This is like playing "pick my number" but the number
       is fixed forever at the start, the guesser gets to know everyone else's
       guesses and results, and can keep playing as long as they like.  It's
       only valid if the players are completely oblivious to what is
       happening.

LIMITATIONS
       Perl versions earlier than 5.8.0 have problems doing exact integer
       math.  Some operations will flip signs, and many operations will
       convert intermediate or output results to doubles, which loses
       precision on 64-bit systems.  This causes numerous functions to not
       work properly.  The test suite will try to determine if your Perl is
       broken (this only applies to really old versions of Perl compiled for
       64-bit when using numbers larger than "~ 2^49").  The best solution is
       updating to a more recent Perl.

       The module is thread-safe and should allow good concurrency on all
       platforms that support Perl threads except Win32.  With Win32, either
       don't use threads or make sure "prime_precalc" is called before using
       "primes", "prime_count", or "nth_prime" with large inputs.  This is
       only an issue if you use non-Cygwin Win32 and call these routines from
       within Perl threads.

       Because the loop functions like "forprimes" use "MULTICALL", there is
       some odd behavior with anonymous sub creation inside the block.  This
       is shared with most XS modules that use "MULTICALL", and is rarely seen
       because it is such an unusual use.  An example is:

         forprimes { my $var = "p is $_"; push @subs, sub {say $var}; } 50;
         $_->() for @subs;

       This can be worked around by using double braces for the function, e.g.
       "forprimes {{ ... }} 50".

SEE ALSO
       This section describes other CPAN modules available that have some
       feature overlap with this one.  Also see the "REFERENCES" section.
       Please let me know if any of this information is inaccurate.  Also note
       that just because a module doesn't match what I believe are the best
       set of features doesn't mean it isn't perfect for someone else.

       I will use SoE to indicate the Sieve of Eratosthenes, and MPU to denote
       this module (Math::Prime::Util).  Some quick alternatives I can
       recommend if you don't want to use MPU:

       •   Math::Prime::FastSieve is the alternative module I use for basic
           functionality with small integers.  It's fast and simple, and has a
           good set of features.

       •   Math::Primality is the alternative module I use for primality
           testing on bigints.  The downside is that it can be slow, and the
           functions other than primality tests are very slow.

       •   Math::Pari if you want the kitchen sink and can install it and
           handle using it.  There are still some functions it doesn't do well
           (e.g. prime count and nth_prime).

       Math::Prime::XS has "is_prime" and "primes" functionality.  There is no
       bigint support.  The "is_prime" function uses well-written trial
       division, meaning it is very fast for small numbers, but terribly slow
       for large 64-bit numbers.  MPU is similarly fast with small numbers,
       but becomes faster as the size increases.  MPXS's prime sieve is an
       unoptimized non-segmented SoE which returns an array.  Sieve bases
       larger than "10^7" start taking inordinately long and using a lot of
       memory (gigabytes beyond "10^10").  E.g. "primes(10**9, 10**9+1000)"
       takes 36 seconds with MPXS, but only 0.0001 seconds with MPU.

       Math::Prime::FastSieve supports "primes", "is_prime", "next_prime",
       "prev_prime", "prime_count", and "nth_prime".  The caveat is that all
       functions only work within the sieved range, so are limited to about
       "10^10".  It uses a fast SoE to generate the main sieve.  The sieve is
       2-3x slower than the base sieve for MPU, and is non-segmented so cannot
       be used for larger values.  Since the functions work with the sieve,
       they are very fast.  The fast bit-vector-lookup functionality can be
       replicated in MPU using "prime_precalc" but is not required.

       Bit::Vector supports the "primes" and "prime_count" functionality in a
       somewhat similar way to Math::Prime::FastSieve.  It is the slowest of
       all the XS sieves, and has the most memory use.  It is faster than pure
       Perl code.

       Crypt::Primes supports "random_maurer_prime" functionality.  MPU has
       more options for random primes (n-digit, n-bit, ranged, strong, and
       S-T) in addition to Maurer's algorithm.  MPU does not have the critical
       bug RT81858 <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=81858>.  MPU
       has a more uniform distribution as well as return a larger subset of
       primes (RT81871 <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=81871>).
       MPU does not depend on Math::Pari though can run slow for bigints
       unless the Math::BigInt::GMP or Math::BigInt::Pari modules are
       installed.  Having Math::Prime::Util::GMP installed makes the speed
       vastly faster.  Crypt::Primes is hardcoded to use Crypt::Random which
       uses /dev/random (blocking source), while MPU uses its own ChaCha20
       implementation seeded from /dev/urandom or Win32.  MPU can return a
       primality certificate.  What Crypt::Primes has that MPU does not is the
       ability to return a generator.

       Math::Factor::XS calculates prime factors and factors, which correspond
       to the "factor" and "divisors" functions of MPU.  Its functions do not
       support bigints.  Both are implemented with trial division, meaning
       they are very fast for really small values, but become very slow as the
       input gets larger (factoring 19 digit semiprimes is over 1000 times
       slower).  The function "count_prime_factors" can be done in MPU using
       "scalar factor($n)".  See the "EXAMPLES" section for a 2-line function
       replicating "matches".

       Math::Big version 1.12 includes "primes" functionality.  The current
       code is only usable for very tiny inputs as it is incredibly slow and
       uses lots of memory.  RT81986
       <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=81986> has a patch to make
       it run much faster and use much less memory.  Since it is in pure Perl
       it will still run quite slow compared to MPU.

       Math::Big::Factors supports factorization using wheel factorization
       (smart trial division).  It supports bigints.  Unfortunately it is
       extremely slow on any input that isn't the product of just small
       factors.  Even 7 digit inputs can take hundreds or thousands of times
       longer to factor than MPU or Math::Factor::XS.  19-digit semiprimes
       will take hours versus MPU's single milliseconds.

       Math::Factoring is a placeholder module for bigint factoring.  Version
       0.02 only supports trial division (the Pollard-Rho method does not
       work).

       Math::Prime::TiedArray allows random access to a tied primes array,
       almost identically to what MPU provides in
       Math::Prime::Util::PrimeArray.  MPU has attempted to fix
       Math::Prime::TiedArray's shift bug (RT58151
       <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=58151>).  MPU is typically
       much faster and will use less memory, but there are some cases where
       MP:TA is faster (MP:TA stores all entries up to the largest request,
       while MPU:PA stores only a window around the last request).

       List::Gen is very interesting and includes a built-in primes iterator
       as well as a "is_prime" filter for arbitrary sequences.  Unfortunately
       both are very slow.

       Math::Primality supports "is_prime", "is_pseudoprime",
       "is_strong_pseudoprime", "is_strong_lucas_pseudoprime", "next_prime",
       "prev_prime", "prime_count", and "is_aks_prime" functionality.  This is
       a great little module that implements primality functionality.  It was
       the first CPAN module to support the BPSW test.  All inputs are
       processed using GMP, so it of course supports bigints.  In fact,
       Math::Primality was made originally with bigints in mind, while MPU was
       originally targeted to native integers, but both have added better
       support for the other.  The main differences are extra functionality
       (MPU has more functions) and performance.  With native integer inputs,
       MPU is generally much faster, especially with "prime_count".  For
       bigints, MPU is slower unless the Math::Prime::Util::GMP module is
       installed, in which case MPU is 2-4x faster.  Math::Primality also
       installs a "primes.pl" program, but it has much less functionality than
       the one included with MPU.

       Math::NumSeq does not have a one-to-one mapping between functions in
       MPU, but it does offer a way to get many similar results such as
       primes, twin primes, Sophie-Germain primes, lucky primes, moebius,
       divisor count, factor count, Euler totient, primorials, etc.
       Math::NumSeq is set up for accessing these values in order rather than
       for arbitrary values, though a few sequences support random access.
       The primary advantage I see is the uniform access mechanism for a lot
       of sequences.  For those methods that overlap, MPU is usually much
       faster.  Importantly, most of the sequences in Math::NumSeq are limited
       to 32-bit indices.

       "cr_combine" in Math::ModInt::ChineseRemainder is similar to MPU's
       "chinese", and in fact they use the same algorithm.  The former module
       uses caching of moduli to speed up further operations.  MPU does not do
       this.  This would only be important for cases where the lcm is larger
       than a native int (noting that use in cryptography would always have
       large moduli).

       For combinations and permutations there are many alternatives.  One
       difference with nearly all of them is that MPU's "forcomb" and
       "forperm" functions don't operate directly on a user array but on
       generic indices.  Math::Combinatorics and Algorithm::Combinatorics have
       more features, but will be slower.  List::Permutor does permutations
       with an iterator.  Algorithm::FastPermute and Algorithm::Permute are
       very similar but can be 2-10x faster than MPU (they use the same user-
       block structure but twiddle the user array each call).

       There are numerous modules to perform a set product (also called
       Cartesian product or cross product).  These include Set::Product,
       Math::Cartesian::Product, Set::Scalar, and Set::CrossProduct, as well
       as a few others.  The Set::CartesianProduct::Lazy module provides
       random access, albeit rather slowly.  Our "forsetproduct" matches
       Set::Product in both high performance and functionality (that module's
       single function "product" in Set::Product is essentially identical to
       ours).

       Math::Pari supports a lot of features, with a great deal of overlap.
       In general, MPU will be faster for native 64-bit integers, while it
       differs for bigints (Pari will always be faster if
       Math::Prime::Util::GMP is not installed; with it, it varies by
       function).  Note that Pari extends many of these functions to other
       spaces (Gaussian integers, complex numbers, vectors, matrices,
       polynomials, etc.) which are beyond the realm of this module.  Some of
       the highlights:

       "isprime"
           The default Math::Pari is built with Pari 2.1.7.  This uses 10 M-R
           tests with randomly chosen bases (fixed seed, but doesn't reset
           each invocation like GMP's "is_probab_prime").  This has a much
           greater chance of false positives compared to the BPSW test -- some
           composites such as 9, 88831, 38503, etc.  (OEIS A141768
           <http://oeis.org/A141768>) have a surprisingly high chance of being
           indicated prime.  Using "isprime($n,1)" will perform an "n-1"
           proof, but this becomes unreasonably slow past 70 or so digits.

           If Math::Pari is built using Pari 2.3.5 (this requires manual
           configuration) then the primality tests are completely different.
           Using "ispseudoprime" will perform a BPSW test and is quite a bit
           faster than the older test.  "isprime" now does an APR-CL proof
           (fast, but no certificate).

           Math::Primality uses a strong BPSW test, which is the standard BPSW
           test based on the 1980 paper.  It has no known counterexamples
           (though like all these tests, we know some exist).  Pari 2.3.5 (and
           through at least 2.6.2) uses an almost-extra-strong BPSW test for
           its "ispseudoprime" function.  This is deterministic for native
           integers, and should be excellent for bigints, with a slightly
           lower chance of counterexamples than the traditional strong test.
           Math::Prime::Util uses the full extra-strong BPSW test, which has
           an even lower chance of counterexample.  With
           Math::Prime::Util::GMP, "is_prime" adds an extra M-R test using a
           random base, which further reduces the probability of a composite
           being allowed to pass.

       "primepi"
           Only available with version 2.3 of Pari.  Similar to MPU's
           "prime_count" function in API, but uses a naive counting algorithm
           with its precalculated primes, so is not of practical use.
           Incidently, Pari 2.6 (not usable from Perl) has fixed the pre-
           calculation requirement so it is more useful, but is still
           thousands of times slower than MPU.

       "primes"
           Doesn't support ranges, requires bumping up the precalculated
           primes for larger numbers, which means knowing in advance the upper
           limit for primes.  Support for numbers larger than 400M requires
           using Pari version 2.3.5.  If that is used, sieving is about 2x
           faster than MPU, but doesn't support segmenting.

       "factorint"
           Similar to MPU's "factor_exp" though with a slightly different
           return.  MPU offers "factor" for a linear array of prime factors
           where
              n = p1 * p2 * p3 * ...   as (p1,p2,p3,...) and "factor_exp" for
           an array of factor/exponent pairs where:
              n = p1^e1 * p2^e2 * ...  as ([p1,e1],[p2,e2],...) Pari/GP
           returns an array similar to the latter.  Math::Pari returns a
           transposed matrix like:
              n = p1^e1 * p2^e2 * ...  as ([p1,p2,...],[e1,e2,...]) Slower
           than MPU for all 64-bit inputs on an x86_64 platform, it may be
           faster for large values on other platforms.  With the newer
           Math::Prime::Util::GMP releases, bigint factoring is slightly
           faster on average in MPU.

       "divisors"
           Similar to MPU's "divisors".

       "forprime", "forcomposite", "fordiv", "sumdiv"
           Similar to MPU's "forprimes", "forcomposites", "fordivisors", and
           "divisor_sum".

       "eulerphi", "moebius"
           Similar to MPU's "euler_phi" and "moebius".  MPU is 2-20x faster
           for native integers.  MPU also supported range inputs, which can be
           much more efficient.  With bigint arguments, MPU is slightly faster
           than Math::Pari if the GMP backend is available, but very slow
           without.

       "gcd", "lcm", "kronecker", "znorder", "znprimroot", "znlog"
           Similar to MPU's "gcd", "lcm", "kronecker", "znorder",
           "znprimroot", and "znlog".  Pari's "znprimroot" only returns the
           smallest root for prime powers.  The behavior is undefined when the
           group is not cyclic (sometimes it throws an exception, sometimes it
           returns an incorrect answer, sometimes it hangs).  MPU's
           "znprimroot" will always return the smallest root if it exists, and
           "undef" otherwise.  Similarly, MPU's "znlog" will return the
           smallest "x" and work with non-primitive-root "g", which is similar
           to Pari/GP 2.6, but not the older versions in Math::Pari.  The
           performance of "znlog" is quite good compared to older Pari/GP, but
           much worse than 2.6's new methods.

       "sigma"
           Similar to MPU's "divisor_sum".  MPU is ~10x faster when the result
           fits in a native integer.  Once things overflow it is fairly
           similar in performance.  However, using Math::BigInt can slow
           things down quite a bit, so for best performance in these cases
           using a Math::GMP object is best.

       "numbpart", "forpart"
           Similar to MPU's "partitions" and "forpart".  These functions were
           introduced in Pari 2.3 and 2.6, hence are not in Math::Pari.
           "numbpart" produce identical results to "partitions", but Pari is
           much faster.  forpart is very similar to Pari's function, but
           produces a different ordering (MPU is the standard anti-
           lexicographical, Pari uses a size sort).  Currently Pari is
           somewhat faster due to Perl function call overhead.  When using
           restrictions, Pari has much better optimizations.

       "eint1"
           Similar to MPU's "ExponentialIntegral".

       "zeta"
           MPU has "RiemannZeta" which takes non-negative real inputs, while
           Pari's function supports negative and complex inputs.

       Overall, Math::Pari supports a huge variety of functionality and has a
       sophisticated and mature code base behind it (noting that the Pari
       library used is about 10 years old now).  For native integers,
       typically Math::Pari will be slower than MPU.  For bigints, Math::Pari
       may be superior and it rarely has any performance surprises.  Some of
       the unique features MPU offers include super fast prime counts,
       nth_prime, ECPP primality proofs with certificates, approximations and
       limits for both, random primes, fast Mertens calculations, Chebyshev
       theta and psi functions, and the logarithmic integral and Riemann R
       functions.  All with fairly minimal installation requirements.

PERFORMANCE
       First, for those looking for the state of the art non-Perl solutions:

       Primality testing
           For general numbers smaller than 2000 or so digits, MPU is the
           fastest solution I am aware of (it is faster than Pari 2.7, PFGW,
           and FLINT).  For very large inputs, PFGW
           <http://sourceforge.net/projects/openpfgw/> is the fastest
           primality testing software I'm aware of.  It has fast trial
           division, and is especially fast on many special forms.  It does
           not have a BPSW test however, and there are quite a few
           counterexamples for a given base of its PRP test, so it is commonly
           used for fast filtering of large candidates.  A test such as the
           BPSW test in this module is then recommended.

       Primality proofs
           Primo <http://www.ellipsa.eu/> is the best method for open source
           primality proving for inputs over 1000 digits.  Primo also does
           well below that size, but other good alternatives are David
           Cleaver's mpzaprcl <http://sourceforge.net/projects/mpzaprcl/>, the
           APRCL from the modern Pari <http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/>
           package, or the standalone ECPP from this module with large
           polynomial set.

       Factoring
           yafu <http://sourceforge.net/projects/yafu/>, msieve
           <http://sourceforge.net/projects/msieve/>, and gmp-ecm
           <http://ecm.gforge.inria.fr/> are all good choices for large
           inputs.  The factoring code in this module (and all other CPAN
           modules) is very limited compared to those.

       Primes
           primesieve <http://code.google.com/p/primesieve/> and yafu
           <http://sourceforge.net/projects/yafu/> are the fastest publically
           available code I am aware of.  Primesieve will additionally take
           advantage of multiple cores with excellent efficiency.  Tomás
           Oliveira e Silva's private code may be faster for very large
           values, but isn't available for testing.

           Note that the Sieve of Atkin is not faster than the Sieve of
           Eratosthenes when both are well implemented.  The only Sieve of
           Atkin that is even competitive is Bernstein's super optimized
           primegen, which runs on par with the SoE in this module.  The SoE's
           in Pari, yafu, and primesieve are all faster.

       Prime Counts and Nth Prime
           Outside of private research implementations doing prime counts for
           "n > 2^64", this module should be close to state of the art in
           performance, and supports results up to "2^64".  Further
           performance improvements are planned, as well as expansion to
           larger values.

           The fastest solution for small inputs is a hybrid table/sieve
           method.  This module does this for values below 60M.  As the inputs
           get larger, either the tables have to grow exponentially or speed
           must be sacrificed.  Hence this is not a good general solution for
           most uses.

   PRIME COUNTS

       Python's standard modules are very slow: MPMATH v0.17 "primepi" takes
       169.5s and 25+ GB of RAM.  SymPy 0.7.1 "primepi" takes 292.2s.  However
       there are very fast solutions written by Robert William Hanks (included
       in the xt/ directory of this distribution): pure Python in 12.1s and
       NUMPY in 2.8s.

   PRIMALITY TESTING

             These inputs are too large for Math::Prime::FastSieve.

       bigints:  is_prime from 10^100 to 10^100 + 0.2M
               2.2s  Math::Prime::Util          (BPSW + 1 random M-R)
               2.7s  Math::Pari w/2.3.5         (BPSW)
              13.0s  Math::Primality            (BPSW)
              35.2s  Math::Pari                 (10 random M-R)
              38.6s  Math::Prime::Util w/o GMP  (BPSW)
              70.7s  Math::Prime::Util          (n-1 or ECPP proof)
             102.9s  Math::Pari w/2.3.5         (APR-CL proof)

       •   MPU is consistently the fastest solution, and performs the most
           stringent probable prime tests on bigints.

       •   Math::Primality has a lot of overhead that makes it quite slow for
           native size integers.  With bigints we finally see it work well.

       •   Math::Pari built with 2.3.5 not only has a better primality test
           versus the default 2.1.7, but runs faster.  It still has quite a
           bit of overhead with native size integers.  Pari/GP 2.5.0 takes
           11.3s, 16.9s, and 2.9s respectively for the tests above.  MPU is
           still faster, but clearly the time for native integers is dominated
           by the calling overhead.

   FACTORING
       Factoring performance depends on the input, and the algorithm choices
       used are still being tuned.  Math::Factor::XS is very fast when given
       input with only small factors, but it slows down rapidly as the
       smallest factor increases in size.  For numbers larger than 32 bits,
       Math::Prime::Util can be 100x or more faster (a number with only very
       small factors will be nearly identical, while a semiprime may be 3000x
       faster).  Math::Pari is much slower with native sized inputs, probably
       due to calling overhead.  For bigints, the Math::Prime::Util::GMP
       module is needed or performance will be far worse than Math::Pari.
       With the GMP module, performance is pretty similar from 20 through 70
       digits, which the caveat that the current MPU factoring uses more
       memory for 60+ digit numbers.

       This slide presentation
       <http://math.boisestate.edu/~liljanab/BOISECRYPTFall09/Jacobsen.pdf>
       has a lot of data on 64-bit and GMP factoring performance I collected
       in 2009.  Assuming you do not know anything about the inputs, trial
       division and optimized Fermat or Lehman work very well for small
       numbers (<= 10 digits), while native SQUFOF is typically the method of
       choice for 11-18 digits (I've seen claims that a lightweight QS can be
       faster for 15+ digits).  Some form of Quadratic Sieve is usually used
       for inputs in the 19-100 digit range, and beyond that is the General
       Number Field Sieve.  For serious factoring, I recommend looking at yafu
       <http://sourceforge.net/projects/yafu/>, msieve
       <http://sourceforge.net/projects/msieve/>, gmp-ecm
       <http://ecm.gforge.inria.fr/>, GGNFS
       <http://sourceforge.net/projects/ggnfs/>, and Pari <http://pari.math.u-
       bordeaux.fr/>.  The latest yafu should cover most uses, with GGNFS
       likely only providing a benefit for numbers large enough to warrant
       distributed processing.

   PRIMALITY PROVING
       The "n-1" proving algorithm in Math::Prime::Util::GMP compares well to
       the version included in Pari.  Both are pretty fast to about 60 digits,
       and work reasonably well to 80 or so before starting to take many
       minutes per number on a fast computer.  Version 0.09 and newer of
       MPU::GMP contain an ECPP implementation that, while not state of the
       art compared to closed source solutions, works quite well.  It averages
       less than a second for proving 200-digit primes including creating a
       certificate.  Times below 200 digits are faster than Pari 2.3.5's APR-
       CL proof.  For larger inputs the bottleneck is a limited set of
       discriminants, and time becomes more variable.  There is a larger set
       of discriminants on github that help, with 300-digit primes taking ~5
       seconds on average and typically under a minute for 500-digits.  For
       primality proving with very large numbers, I recommend Primo
       <http://www.ellipsa.eu/>.

         random    = random_nbit_prime  (results pass BPSW)
         random+   = additional time for 3 M-R and a Frobenius test
         maurer    = random_maurer_prime
         Shw-Tylr  = random_shawe_taylor_prime
         CPMaurer  = Crypt::Primes::maurer

       "random_nbit_prime" is reasonably fast, and for most purposes should
       suffice.  For cryptographic purposes, one may want additional tests or
       a proven prime.  Additional tests are quite cheap, as shown by the time
       for three extra M-R and a Frobenius test.  At these bit sizes, the
       chances a composite number passes BPSW, three more M-R tests, and a
       Frobenius test is extraordinarily small.

       "random_proven_prime" provides a randomly selected prime with an
       optional certificate, without specifying the particular method.  With
       GMP installed this always uses Maurer's algorithm as it is the best
       compromise between speed and diversity.

       "random_maurer_prime" constructs a provable prime.  A primality test is
       run on each intermediate, and it also constructs a complete primality
       certificate which is verified at the end (and can be returned).  While
       the result is uniformly distributed, only about 10% of the primes in
       the range are selected for output.  This is a result of the FastPrime
       algorithm and is usually unimportant.

       "random_shawe_taylor_prime" similarly constructs a provable prime.  It
       uses a simpler construction method.  It is slightly faster than
       Maurer's algorithm but provides less diversity (even fewer primes in
       the range are selected, though for typical cryptographic sizes this is
       not important).  The Perl implementation uses a single large random
       seed followed by SHA-256 as specified by FIPS 186-4.  The GMP
       implementation uses the same FIPS 186-4 algorithm but uses its own
       CSPRNG which may not be SHA-256.

       "maurer" in Crypt::Primes times are included for comparison.  It is
       reasonably fast for small sizes but gets slow as the size increases.
       It is 10 to 500 times slower than this module's GMP methods.  It does
       not perform any primality checks on the intermediate results or the
       final result (I highly recommended running a primality test on the
       output).  Additionally important for servers, "maurer" in Crypt::Primes
       uses excessive system entropy and can grind to a halt if "/dev/random"
       is exhausted (it can take days to return).

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
       Eratosthenes of Cyrene provided the elegant and simple algorithm for
       finding primes.

       Terje Mathisen, A.R. Quesada, and B. Van Pelt all had useful ideas
       which I used in my wheel sieve.

       The SQUFOF implementation being used is a slight modification to the
       public domain racing version written by Ben Buhrow.  Enhancements with
       ideas from Ben's later code as well as Jason Papadopoulos's public
       domain implementations are planned for a later version.

       The LMO implementation is based on the 2003 preprint from Christian
       Bau, as well as the 2006 paper from Tomás Oliveira e Silva.  I also
       want to thank Kim Walisch for the many discussions about prime
       counting.
