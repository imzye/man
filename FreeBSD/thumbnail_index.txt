thumbnail_index(1)      FreeBSD General Commands Manual     thumbnail_index(1)

NAME
       thumbnail_index - make an HTML index file for a bunch of images

SYNOPSIS
       thumbnail_index [-r] [-s size] [-c cols] [-i indexname]

DESCRIPTION
       Run this script in a web directory consisting of all or mostly image
       files.  It'll create an index.html of thumbnail images, putting the
       thumbnail files in a hidden subdirectory.

       It avoids unnecessary work by comparing the dates on already existing
       thumbnail files and not re-creating them if the corresponding original
       has not changed.

       It also refuses to overwrite an index.html file not created by this
       script.

OPTIONS
       -r     Recursively makes index files for all subdirectories.

       Specifies the size of the thumbnail image.
              Default is 70 pixels.  If you want to re-do an already indexed
              directory but use different size thumbnails, you have to remove
              the old thumbnails.  An "rm -rf .thumbnails" should suffice.

       -c     Specifies how many columns of images.  Default is 5.

       -i     Specifies the filename of the index file.  Default is index.html
              (some sites use .index.html instead).
