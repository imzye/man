DESCRIPTION
     The vga driver is a generic video card driver which provides access to
     video cards.  This driver is required for the console driver syscons(4).
     The console driver will call the vga driver to manipulate video hardware
     (changing video modes, loading font, etc).

     The vga driver supports the standard video cards: MDA, CGA, EGA and VGA.
     In addition, the driver can utilize VESA BIOS extensions if the video
     card supports them.  VESA support can either be statically included in
     the kernel or can be loaded as a separate module.

     In order to statically link the VESA support to the kernel, the VESA
     option (see below) must be defined in the kernel configuration file.

     The vesa module can be dynamically loaded into the kernel using
     kldload(8).

DRIVER CONFIGURATION
   Kernel Configuration Options
     The following kernel configuration options (see config(8)) can be used to
     control the vga driver.  These options provide compatibility with certain
     VGA cards.

     VGA_ALT_SEQACCESS
            You may want to try this option if the mouse pointer is not drawn
            correctly or the font does not seem to be loaded properly on the
            VGA card.  However, it may cause flicker on some systems.

     VGA_SLOW_IOACCESS
            Older VGA cards may require this option for proper operation.  It
            makes the driver perform byte-wide I/O to VGA registers and slow
            down a little.

     VGA_WIDTH90
            This option enables 90 column modes: 90x25, 90x30, 90x43, 90x50,
            90x60.  These modes are not always supported by the video card and
            the display.  It is highly likely that LCD display cannot work
            with these modes.

     The following options add optional features to the driver.

     VESA   Add VESA BIOS support to the driver.  If the VGA card has the VESA
            BIOS extension 1.2 or later, this option will utilize the VESA
            BIOS service to switch to high resolution modes.

     VESA_DEBUG=N
            Set the VESA support debug level to N.  The default value is zero,
            which suppresses all debugging output.

     The following options will remove some features from the vga driver and
     save kernel memory.

     VGA_NO_FONT_LOADING
            The vga driver can load software font to EGA and VGA cards.  This
            option removes this feature.  Note that if you use this option and
            still wish to use the mouse on the console then you must also use
            the SC_ALT_MOUSE_IMAGE option.  See syscons(4).

     VGA_NO_MODE_CHANGE
            This option prevents the driver from changing video modes.

EXAMPLES
     Your kernel configuration should normally have:

           device vga

     And you need the following line in /boot/device.hints.

           hint.vga.0.at="isa"

     The following lines should be included in the kernel configuration file
     in order to enable the VESA BIOS Extension support.

           options VESA
           device vga

     If you do not want VESA support included in the kernel, but want to use
     occasionally, do not add the VESA option.  And load the vesa module as
     desired:

           kldload vesa
