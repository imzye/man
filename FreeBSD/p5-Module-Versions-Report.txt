Module::Versions::Report(3)                User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Module::Versions::Report -- report versions of all modules in memory

SYNOPSIS
         use Module::Versions::Report;

         ...and any code you want...

       This will run all your code normally, but then as the Perl interpreter
       is about to exit, it will print something like:

         Perl v5.6.1 under MSWin32.
          Modules in memory:
           attributes;
           AutoLoader v5.58;
           Carp;
           Config;
           DynaLoader v1.04;
           Exporter v5.562;
           Module::Versions::Report v1.01;
           HTML::Entities v1.22;
           HTML::HeadParser v2.15;
           HTML::Parser v3.25;
           [... and whatever other modules were loaded that session...]

       Consider its use from the command line:

         % perl -MModule::Versions::Report -MLWP -e 1

         Perl v5.6.1 under MSWin32.
          Modules in memory:
           attributes;
           AutoLoader v5.58;
           [...]

DESCRIPTION
       I often get email from someone reporting a bug in a module I've
       written.  I email back, asking what version of the module it is, what
       version of Perl on what OS, and sometimes what version of some relevent
       third library (like XML::Parser).  They reply, saying "Perl 5".  I say
       "I need the exact version, as reported by "perl -v"".  They tell me.
       And I say "I, uh, also asked about the version of my module and
       XML::Parser [or whatever]".  They say "Oh yeah.  It's 2.27".  "Is that
       my module or XML::Parser?"  "XML::Parser."  "OK, and what about my
       module's version?"  "Ohyeah.  That's 3.11."  By this time, days have
       passed, and what should have been a simple operation -- reporting the
       version of Perl and relevent modules, has been needlessly complicated.

       This module is for simplifying that task.  If you add "use
       Module::Versions::Report;" to a program (especially handy if your
       program is one that demonstrates a bug in some module), then when the
       program has finished running, you well get a report detailing the all
       modules in memory, and noting the version of each (for modules that
       defined a $VERSION, at least).

USING
   Importing
       If this package is imported then END block is set, and report printed
       to stdout on a program exit, so use "use Module::Versions::Report;" if
       you need a report on exit or "use Module::Versions::Report ();"
       otherwise and call report or print_report functions yourself.

   report and print_report functions
       The first one returns preformatted report as a string, the latter
       outputs a report to stdout.
