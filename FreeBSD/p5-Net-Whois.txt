NAME
       Net::Whois - Get and parse "whois" domain data from InterNIC

SYNOPSIS
       Note that all fields except "name" and "tag" may be undef because
       "whois" information is erratically filled in.

       use Net::Whois; use Carp;

        my $w = new Net::Whois::Domain $dom
        or die "Can't connect to Whois server\n;

        unless ($w->ok) { croak "No match for $dom";}

        print "Domain: ", $w->domain, "\n";
        print "Name: ", $w->name, "\n";
        print "Tag: ", $w->tag, "\n";
        print "Address:\n", map { "    $_\n" } $w->address;
        print "Country: ", $w->country, "\n";
        print "Name Servers:\n", map { "    $$_[0] ($$_[1])\n" }
        @{$w->servers};
        my ($c, $t);
        if ($c = $w->contacts) {
          print "Contacts:\n";
          for $t (sort keys %$c) {
            print "    $t:\n";
            print map { "\t$_\n" } @{$$c{$t}};
          }
        }
        print "Record created:", $w->record_created ;
        print "Record updated:", $w->record_updated ;

DESCRIPTION
       Net::Whois::Domain new() attempts to retrieve and parse the given
       domain's "whois" information from the InterNIC (whois.internic.net).
       If the server could not be contacted, is too busy, or otherwise does
       not process the query then the constructor does not return a reference
       and your object is undefined.  If the constructor returns a reference,
       that reference can be used to access the various attributes of the
       domains' whois entry assuming that there was a match.  The member
       function ok returns 1 if a match 0 if no match.

       Note that the Locale::Country module (part of the Locale-Codes
       distribution) is used to recognize spelled-out country names; if that
       module is not present, only two-letter country abbreviations will be
       recognized.

       The server consulted is "whois.internic.net". You can only get .org,
       .edu, .net, .com domains from Internic. Other whois servers for other
       Top-Level-Domains (TLD) return information in a different syntax and
       are not supported at this time. Also, only queries for domains are
       valid. Querying for a network will fail utterly since those are not
       kept in the whois.internic.net server (a future enhancement will add a
       network lookup function). Querying for NIC handles won't work since
       they have a different return syntax than a domain. Domains other than
       those listed won't work they're not in the server. A future enhancment
       planned will send the query to the appropriate server based on its TLD.

       (dhudes@hudes.org) found this but it was broken and he needed it so he
       fixed it.  In August, 1999 Dana and Chip agreed to become co-
       maintainers of the module.  Dana released a new version of Net::Whois
       to CPAN and resumed active development.
