MKPREVIEW(1)            FreeBSD General Commands Manual           MKPREVIEW(1)

NAME
       mkpreview - scale an image down to an arbitrary size

SYNOPSIS
       mkpreview infile outfile width height

DESCRIPTION
       mkpreview scales an image (in any format supported by the Window Maker
       raster library) down to an arbitrary size, specified by the width and
       height arguments. Note that it can only scale down, not up.

BUGS
       The quality of the scaled image is not very good, and users are advised
       to use something like the ImageMagick mogrify(1) command instead.
