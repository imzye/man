NAME
       Test::Metadata - Class for capturing build and test log data and
       generating an XML Metadata file about it.

SYNOPSIS
        use Test::Metadata;
        use Test::Parser::KernelBuild;
        use Test::Parser::MyTest;

        my $build_results = new Test::Parser::KernelBuild;
        $build_results->parse("kernel_build.log");

        my $test_results  = new Test::Parser::MyTest;
        $test_results->parse("my_test.log");

        my $metadata = new Test::Metadata;
        $metadata->add_build($build_results);
        $metadata->add_test($test_results);

        print $metadata->to_xml();

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides an interface for creating metadata summaries of
       software build and test results.  It is designed to work in conjunction
       with Test::Parser subclasses, to allow you to gather and report on a
       set of tests run atop a given set of built software.

       Essentially, you use Test::Parser to parse all your build and test
       files, and then add each of them to a Test::Metadata object.  You can
       then generate an XML file for the combined results, suitable for use
       with other tools.

       The XML format used is the 'Test Result Publication Interface' (TRPI)
       XML schema, developed by SpikeSource.  See
       http://www.spikesource.com/testresults/index.jsp?show=trpi-schema

FUNCTIONS
   new()
       Creates a new Test::Metadata object.

       add_build($build)

       Takes a Test::Parser object and extracts information about it and
       builds an internal build metadata representation.

   substitute_template($template, $data_hashref)
       Performs substitutions of values in the form '[%variable%]' with the
       corresponding value given by $data_hashref->{variable}.  Any undefined
       items are replaced with blank strings.

   to_xml()
       Returns the parsed test result data in the TRPI XML syntax
       (http://www.spikesource.com/testresults/index.jsp?show=trpi-schema).

       In the case of an error, undef will be returned.  The error message can
       be retrieved via error().

   parse($file)
       Parses the given xml (TRPI) file or url and loads the data into the
       current object.

   id()
       Returns the id of the parsed test.

   total_executed
       Returns the total number of executed test cases

   total_passed
       Returns the total number of passed test cases

   total_failed
       Returns the total number of failed test cases

   total_skipped
       Returns the total number of test cases that were not run

PREREQUISITES
