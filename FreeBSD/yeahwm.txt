NAME
       yeahwm - Minimalist Window Manager for X

SYNOPSIS
       yeahwm [ -display display ] [ -term termprog ] [ -fg foreground ] [ -bg
       background ] [ -bw borderwidth ] [ -snap num ] [ -V ]

DESCRIPTION
       yeahwm is a minimalist window manager based on evilwm.

       In yeahwm, the focus follows the mouse pointer, and focus if not lost
       is you stray onto the root window.  The current window border is shaded
       gold, with other windows left as a dark grey.

       You can use the mouse to manipulate windows either by click/dragging
       the 1 pixel border, or by holding down Alt and doing so anywhere in the
       client window. The controls are:

       Button 1
              Move window.

       Button 3
              Resize window.

       Mousewheel down
              Lower window.

       Mousewheel up
              Raise window.

       Mousewheel over root window switches virtual desktops

       Dragging the window againstthe left/right screen edge will switch to
       prev./next virtual Worspace.

       Most keyboard controls are used by holding down Control and Alt, then
       pressing a key. Available functions are:

       Return Spawn new terminal.

       Escape Delete current window.

       Insert Lower current window.

       H, J, K, L
              Move window left, down, up or right (16 pixels).

       Y, U, B, N
              Move window to top-left, top-right, bottom-left or bottom-right
              of screen.

       I      Show information about current window.

       Equals Maximise current window vertically (toggle).

       X      Maximise current window (toggle).

       If compiled with virtual desktop support, these functions are also
       available:

       F      Fix or unfix current window.

       1 - 8  Switch virtual desktop.

       Left   Previous virtual desktop.

       Right  Next virtual desktop.

       In addition to the above, Alt+Tab can be used to cycle through windows
       on screen.

       To make yeahwm exit, you have to kill the process.

              specifies the X display to run on.

       -term termprog
              specifies an alternative program to run when spawning a new

       -fg foreground
              frame colour of currently active window.

       -bg background
              frame colour of inactive windows.

              enable snap-to-border support.  num gives the proximity in
              pixels to snap to.
