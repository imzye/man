NAME
       stime - print current time information to standard out

SYNOPSIS
         stime

         stime UKIRT

         stime -epoch 837459706 JCMT

         stime -h

DESCRIPTION
       This program prints current local time, UTC, Julian date, modified
       Julian date, current equinox and year day to standard output.
       Additionally, local sidereal time for the specified telescope is also
       displayed.

ARGUMENTS
       The optional argument can be used to specify the details for a
       particular telescope. This affects the local sidereal time calculation.
       The default is for the LST of Mauna Kea to be listed (specifically the
       James Clerk Maxwell Telescope). The sidereal time does not reflect the
       longitude of the computer used to run the command.

       The format of this string is identical to that required by "palObs"
       routine in the "Astro::PAL" package.

OPTIONS
       The following command line options are supported:

       -epoch
           Override the time for which the LST will be calculated. By default
           will use the current time/date. This epoch should be supplied in
           seconds in the Unix epoch (essentially the argument to the perl
           localtime/gmtime functions).

       -help
           Simple help message.

       -man
           This manual page.

OUTPUT
       Example output of this program is:

        At local date and time         Fri Mar 24 14:50:31 2000
        The UT date and time was:      Sat Mar 25 00:50:31 2000
        Julian date:                   2451628.54
        Modified Julian date:          51628.04
        Equinox for today is           2000.23
        Local Day number (UT):         84 (85)
        For telescope JCMT
        The local sidereal time was    2 39 46.16
