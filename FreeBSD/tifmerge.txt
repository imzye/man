NAME
     TiffAppend – tifmerge library function manual page

SYNOPSIS
     #include <tifmerge.h>

     int
     TiffAppend(const char *ptr out, const char *ptr in);

DESCRIPTION
     This is the tifmerge library function manual page for the TiffAppend()
     function.  This function merges two TIFF files into a single multi-page
     TIFF file.

     The TiffAppend() function takes two arguments: out and in.  Both
     arguments contain the pointer to the name of a file. Both files must
     exist and be valid TIFF files.

     The TiffAppend() function will append the images contained in the in file
     to the images inside the out file.

     The function is declared in ⟨tifmerge.h⟩, located in the
     /usr/local/include directory.

RETURN VALUES
     The TiffAppend() function returns 0 on success, non-0 otherwise.

ENVIRONMENT
     The TiffAppend() library function ignores the environment variables.

BUGS
     The original version of the TiffAppend() function causes a core dump if
     the out argument is not a valid TIFF file. This is fixed in the FreeBSD
     port.
