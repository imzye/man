XBANISH(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             XBANISH(1)

NAME
     xbanish – hide the X11 mouse cursor when a key is pressed

SYNOPSIS
     xbanish [-a] [-d] [-i modifier] [-m [w]nw|ne|sw|se] [-t seconds] [-s]

DESCRIPTION
     xbanish hides the X11 mouse cursor when a key is pressed.  The cursor is
     shown again when it is moved or a mouse button is pressed.  This is
     similar to the xterm(1) setting pointerMode but the effect is global in
     the X11 session.

OPTIONS
     -a      Always keep mouse cursor hidden while xbanish is running.

     -d      Print debugging messages to stdout.

     -i modifier
             Ignore pressed key if modifier is used.  Modifiers are: shift,
             lock (CapsLock), control, mod1 (Alt or Meta), mod2 (NumLock),
             mod3 (Hyper), mod4 (Super, Windows, or Command), mod5 (ISO Level
             3 Shift), and all

     -m [w]nw|ne|sw|se
             When hiding the mouse cursor, move it to this corner of the
             screen or current window, then move it back when showing the
             cursor.

     -t seconds
             Hide the mouse cursor after seconds have passed without mouse
             movement.

     -s      Ignore scrolling events.
