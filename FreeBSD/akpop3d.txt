AKPOP3D(8)              FreeBSD System Manager's Manual             AKPOP3D(8)

NAME
     akpop3d – small and secure POP3 daemon

SYNOPSIS
     akpop3d [-s] [-p port] [-d] [-f pidfile] [-c certfile] [-k keyfile]
             [-l address] [-a authfile] [-m spooldir] [-D] [-L mboxfile]
             [-t timeout] [-x tmpdir] [-v] [-h]

DESCRIPTION
     akpop3d is a small and secure implementation of a server for as described
     in RFC1939. Furthermore, POP3-over-SSL for secure retrieval of email is
     also supported.

     akpop3d must be started as root. It then listens for connections on port
     110. When the commandline switch -s is used, POP3-over-SSL is enabled,
     and akpop3d listens on port 995.

     akpop3d is usually started via some kind of startup script, which depends
     on your Unix system. Init scripts for Debian and Red Hat systems are
     provided with the source package.

OPTIONS
     akpop3d accepts the following commandline switches:

     -d      Run as a daemon (in the background). The process ID of the daemon
             is written to a PID file, which by default is
             /var/run/akpop3d.pid but which can be changed using the -f
             option.

     -f pidfile
             Store the process ID of the daemon in pidfile which must be
             specified as a full path (i.e.  /path/to/something instead of
             something on its own).

     -s      SSL mode: instead of listening on port 110, akpop3d will listen
             on port 995 and will use SSL to encrypt communications. The
             certificate and key will be taken from /etc/akpop3d/cert.pem and
             /etc/akpop3d/key.pem respectively unless set with the -c and -k
             options.

     -c certfile
             Use certfile for the SSL certificate. (Point this to your SSL
             certificate.)

     -k keyfile
             Use keyfile for the SSL key. (Point this to your RSA key.)

     -p port
             Listen on the given port instead of port 995 (SSL) or 110 (non-
             SSL).

     -l address
             Listen on the given address instead of not binding to a specific
             IP address.

     -a authfile
             Instead of using /etc/passwd for authentication, read information
             from the authfile text file. The format of this file is
             username:password:unixname:maildrop (one record per line), where
             username is the POP3 username, password is the POP3 password,
             unixname is the Unix username to run as when reading the mailbox,
             and maildrop is the full path to the maildrop file to use for
             that user. Note that as with the -f option, authfile must be
             specified as a full path.

             The password may be given either as an MD5 hash or in the clear
             (not recommended).  If MD5 us used, the value should be "MD5-"
             followed by 32 hexadecimal digits (lower case) representing the
             MD5 output of the following string: The password, a line feed
             (ASCII 10), the user name, a line feed, and the magic string
             "akpop3d".  No trailing line feed after the magic string.  As an
             example, the password "foo" for user "bar" would be
             "MD5-a199706d2b8302a086a20fe9fb4e8403".

             If the programs printf and md5sum are available, which they
             typically are on GNU-based systems, the hash may be calculated
             using the following command:

                 printf "foo\nbar\nakpop3d" | md5sum

     -m spooldir
             specifies an alternative mail spool directory. The default is
             /var/mail/.

     -D      enables using the files /etc/pop3.allow and /etc/pop3.deny for
             specifying users that are allowed to receive email via POP3.

     -L mboxfile
             uses the file mboxfile in the user's home directory as mailspool.

     -t timeout
             sets a timeout of timeout seconds for read and write operations.
             The default is 30 seconds.

     -x tmpdir
             set the default temporary directory to tmpdir.

     -v      Show the program version and exit.

     -h      Show a summary of program options and exit.
