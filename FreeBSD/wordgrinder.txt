WORDGRINDER(1)           Terminal-based word processor          WORDGRINDER(1)



NAME
       wordgrinder - console-based word processor




SYNOPSIS
       wordgrinder [options] [filename]




DESCRIPTION
       wordgrinder is a simple character cell word processor that runs on the
       console. It is primarily designed for text entry. It's designed to get
       the hell out of your way and let you write; it does very little, but
       what it does it does well.

       It supports Unicode, basic paragraph styles, basic character styles,
       basic screen markup, a menu interface that means you don't have to
       remember complex key sequences, HTML import and export, and some other
       useful features.

       When running, pressing ESC (or ALT + menu shortcut key) will open the
       menu.




OPTIONS
       These options follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
       options starting with two dashes (`-').


       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.


       --lua filename
              Loads and executes a Lua file before startup.


       --convert srcfile_destfile
              Converts from srcfile to destfile and then exits.

              The type of the file is autodetected from the extension of the
              filename. The source file may have a document name suffixed with
              a : for use when importing or exporting WordGrinder files.


       --config file.lua
              Sets the name of the user config file.



CONFIGURATION
       The user config file is a Lua file which is loaded and executed before
       the program starts up (but after any --lua files). It defaults to:


       ~/.wordgrinder.lua
