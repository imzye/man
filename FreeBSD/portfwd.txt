Portfwd(5)                FreeBSD File Formats Manual               Portfwd(5)

NAME
       portfwd.cfg - Portfwd configuration file

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly Portfwd configuration syntax.

       A future version of this document is expected to fully present the
       configuration syntax.

       For now, one should refer to the file conf.txt and to configuration
       examples provided with Portfwd distribution.

BUGS
       Portfwd would benefit from a cleaner syntax for bind address
       specification.
