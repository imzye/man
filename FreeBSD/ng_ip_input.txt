NAME
     ng_ip_input – netgraph IP input node type

SYNOPSIS
     #include <netgraph/ng_ip_input.h>

DESCRIPTION
     The ip_input node type takes all received packets and queues them into
     the IP in input processing subsystem.

HOOKS
     An ng_ip_input node accepts any request to connect, regardless of the
     hook name, as long as the name is unique.

CONTROL MESSAGES
     This node type supports only the generic control messages.  Other control
     messages are silently discarded.

SHUTDOWN
     This node shuts down upon receipt of a NGM_SHUTDOWN control message, or
     when all hooks have been disconnected.

SEE ALSO
     netgraph(4), ngctl(8)

HISTORY
     The ng_ip_input node type was implemented in FreeBSD 5.0.

BUGS
