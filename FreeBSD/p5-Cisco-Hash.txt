NAME
       Cisco::Hash - De- and encrypts Cisco type 7 hashes

SYNOPSIS
       use Cisco::Hash qw(decrypt encrypt usage);

       print encrypt('cisco', 15);          # will produce 1511021F0725

       print decrypt('1511021F0725');       # will produce cisco print
       decrypt(encrypt('cisco', 15)); # as will this too

       usage; # prints information about the module

DESCRIPTION
       This Module decrypts all kind of Cisco encrypted hashes also referred
       to as type 7 passwords. Further you can encrypt any given string into a
       encrypted hash that will be accepted by any Cisco device as an
       encrypted type 7 password.

METHODS
       decrypt(encrypted_hash)
           Paste the encrypted hash without any preceding information.

           Exmaple: "decrypt('1511021F0725'); # Will return 'cisco'"

       encrypt(passphrase, offset)
           You can define any passphrase you like to encrpyt into a encrypted
           hash.  Altough it seems that Cisco devices strip of all characters
           above the 224th position.

           The offset describes at which position of the translate mask
           encryption should be startet. Due to the length of the mask (which
           is 53) allowed values are 0 to 52 (decimal).

           Example: "encrypt('cisco', 15); # will return '1511021F0725'"

       usage
           Usage will give hints on how to use the methods provided by this
           module.
