NAME
     wpa_supplicant – WPA/802.11i Supplicant for wireless network devices

SYNOPSIS
     wpa_supplicant [-BdhKLqstuvW] [-b br_ifname] -c config-file [-C ctrl]
                    [-D driver] [-f debug file] [-g global ctrl] -i ifname
                    [-o override driver] [-O override ctrl] [-P pid file] [-N
                    -i ifname -c config-file [-C ctrl] [-D -driver]
                    [-p driver_param] [-b br_ifname] ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The wpa_supplicant utility is an implementation of the WPA Supplicant
     component, i.e., the part that runs in the client stations.  It
     implements WPA key negotiation with a WPA Authenticator and EAP
     authentication with an Authentication Server.  In addition,
     wpa_supplicant controls the roaming and IEEE 802.11
     authentication/association support of the wlan(4) module and can be used
     to configure static WEP keys based on identified networks.

     The wpa_supplicant utility is designed to be a “daemon” program that runs
     in the background and acts as the backend component controlling the
     wireless connection.  It supports separate frontend programs such as the
     text-based wpa_cli(8) program.

     The following arguments must be specified on the command line:

     -i ifname
             Use the specified wireless interface.

     -c config-file
             Use the settings in the specified configuration file when
             managing the wireless interface.  See wpa_supplicant.conf(5) for
             a description of the configuration file syntax and contents.

             Changes to the configuration file can be reloaded by sending a
             SIGHUP to the wpa_supplicant process or with the wpa_cli(8)
             utility, using “wpa_cli reconfigure”.

OPTIONS
     The following options are available:

     -b      Optional bridge interface name.

     -B      Detach from the controlling terminal and run as a daemon process
             in the background.

     -d      Enable debugging messages.  If this option is supplied twice,
             more verbose messages are displayed.

     -D      Driver name (can be multiple drivers: nl80211,wext).

     -f      Log output to debug file instead of stdout.

     -g      Global ctrl_interface.

     -h      Show help text.

     -K      Include key information in debugging output.

     -L      Display the license for this program on the terminal and exit.

     -N      Start describing a new interface.

     -o      Overrides driver parameter for new interfaces.

     -O      Override ctrl_interface parameter for new interfaces.

     -p      Specify driver parameters.

     -P      File in which to save the process PID.

     -q      Decrease debugging verbosity (i.e., counteract the use of the -d
             flag).

     -s      Send log messages through syslog(3) instead of to the terminal.

     -t      Include timestamp in debug messages.

     -v      Display version information on the terminal and exit.

     -W      Wait for a control interface monitor before starting.
