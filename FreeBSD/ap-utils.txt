NAME
       ap-trapd - a SNMP trap processing daemon


SYNOPSIS
       ap-trapd [ -i device ] [-u user ] [-s]


DESCRIPTION
       ap-trapd It's a SNMP trap processing daemon that accepts traps, parse
       them and store useful data using syslog, at logging LEVEL0.  Specify
       device to listen for SNMP traps on the particular device (this option
       only works at Linux). To be running by user different from nobody you
       may specify user.
       To correct work with Smartbridges APs specify -s key (they use specific
       traps).
       Utility added to ap-utils from version 0.8.


SYSLOG
       To store traps to own log file you may add next string to your
       /etc/syslog.conf
            local0.*       /var/log/ap-traps.log
       After doing it, just restart syslogd with command like
            killall -HUP syslogd

       action happened to the Access Point such as:
