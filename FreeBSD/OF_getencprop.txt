DESCRIPTION
     Device nodes can have associated properties.  Properties consist of a
     name and a value.  A name is a human-readable string from 1 to 31
     characters long.  A value is an array of zero or more bytes that encode
     certain information.  The meaning of that bytes depends on how drivers
     interpret them.  Properties can encode byte arrays, text strings,
     unsigned 32-bit values or any combination of these types.

     Property with a zero-length value usually represents boolean information.
     If the property is present, it signifies true, otherwise false.

     A byte array is encoded as a sequence of bytes and represents values like
     MAC addresses.

     A text string is a sequence of n printable characters.  It is encoded as
     a byte array of length n + 1 bytes with characters represented as bytes
     plus a terminating null character.

     Unsigned 32-bit values, also sometimes called cells, are encoded as a
     sequence of 4 bytes in big-endian order.

     OF_getproplen() returns either the length of the value associated with
     the property propname in the node identified by node, or 0 if the
     property exists but has no associated value.  If propname does not exist,
     -1 is returned.

     OF_getprop() copies a maximum of len bytes from the value associated with
     the property propname of the device node node into the memory specified
     by buf.  Returns the actual size of the value or -1 if the property does
     not exist.

     OF_getencprop() copies a maximum of len bytes into memory specified by
     buf, then converts cell values from big-endian to host byte order.
     Returns the actual size of the value in bytes, or -1 if the property does
     not exist.  len must be a multiple of 4.

     OF_hasprop() returns 1 if the device node node has a property specified
     by propname, and zero if the property does not exist.

     OF_searchprop() recursively looks for the property specified by propname
     starting with the device node node followed by the parent node and up to
     the root node.  If the property is found, the function copies a maximum
     of len bytes of the value associated with the property into the memory
     specified by buf.  Returns the actual size in bytes of the value, or -1
     if the property does not exist.

     OF_searchencprop() recursively looks for the property specified by
     propname starting with the device node node followed by the parent node
     and up to the root node.  If the property is found, the function copies a
     maximum of len bytes of the value associated with the property into the
     memory specified by buf, then converts cell values from big-endian to
     host byte order.  Returns the actual size in bytes of the value, or -1 if
     the property does not exist.

     OF_getprop_alloc() allocates memory large enough to hold the value
     associated with the property propname of the device node node and copies
     the value into the newly allocated memory region.  Returns the actual
     size of the value and stores the address of the allocated memory in *buf.
     If the property has a zero-sized value *buf is set NULL.  Returns -1 if
     the property does not exist or memory allocation failed.  Allocated
     memory should be released when no longer required by calling
     OF_prop_free().  The function might sleep when allocating memory.

     OF_getencprop_alloc() allocates enough memory to hold the value
     associated with the property propname of the device node node, copies the
     value into the newly allocated memory region, and then converts cell
     values from big-endian to host byte order.  The actual size of the value
     is returned and the address of allocated memory is stored in *buf.  If
     the property has zero-length value, *buf is set to NULL.  Returns -1 if
     the property does not exist or memory allocation failed or the size of
     the value is not divisible by a cell size (4 bytes).  Allocated memory
     should be released when no longer required by calling OF_prop_free().
     The function might sleep when allocating memory.

     OF_getprop_alloc_multi() allocates memory large enough to hold the value
     associated with the property propname of the device node node and copies
     the value into the newly allocated memory region.  The value is expected
     to be an array of zero or more elements elsz bytes long.  Returns the
     number of elements in the value and stores the address of the allocated
     memory in *buf.  If the property has a zero-sized value *buf is set NULL.
     Returns -1 if the property does not exist or memory allocation failed or
     the size of the value is not divisible by elsz.  Allocated memory should
     be released when no longer required by calling OF_prop_free().  The
     function might sleep when allocating memory.

     OF_getencprop_alloc_multi() allocates memory large enough to hold the
     value associated with the property propname of the device node node and
     copies the value into the newly allocated memory region, and then
     converts cell values from big-endian to host byte order.  The value is
     expected to be an array of zero or more elements elsz bytes long.
     Returns the number of elements in the value and stores the address of the
     allocated memory in *buf.  If the property has a zero-sized value *buf is
     set NULL.  Returns -1 if the property does not exist or memory allocation
     failed or the size of the value is not divisible by elsz.  Allocated
     memory should be released when no longer required by calling
     OF_prop_free().  The function might sleep when allocating memory.

     OF_prop_free() releases memory at buf that was allocated by
     OF_getprop_alloc(), OF_getencprop_alloc(), OF_getprop_alloc_multi(),
     OF_getencprop_alloc_multi().

     OF_nextprop() copies a maximum of size bytes of the name of the property
     following the propname property into buf.  If propname is NULL, the
     function copies the name of the first property of the device node node.
     OF_nextprop() returns -1 if propname is invalid or there is an internal
     error, 0 if there are no more properties after propname, or 1 otherwise.

     OF_setprop() sets the value of the property propname in the device node
     node to the value beginning at the address specified by buf and running
     for len bytes.  If the property does not exist, the function tries to
     create it.  OF_setprop() returns the actual size of the new value, or -1
     if the property value cannot be changed or the new property cannot be
     created.

         device_t hdmi;
         uint8_t mac[6];
         char *model;

          * Get a byte array property
          */
         if (OF_getprop(node, "eth,hwaddr", mac, sizeof(mac)) != sizeof(mac))
             return;

         /*
          * Get internal node reference and device associated with it
          */
         if (OF_getencprop(node, "hdmi", &hdmixref) <= 0)
             return;
         hdmi = OF_device_from_xref(hdmixref);

         /*
          * Get string value of model property of HDMI framer node
          */
         hdminode = OF_node_from_xref(hdmixref);
         if (OF_getprop_alloc(hdminode, "model", (void **)&model) <= 0)
             return;
