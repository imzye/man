TDFX(4)                FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                TDFX(4)

NAME
     tdfx – Voodoo Graphics and VoodooII Memory Access GLIDE device driver

SYNOPSIS
     device tdfx
     device tdfx_linux

DESCRIPTION
     This driver creates an entry in /dev that allows programs (mostly
     GLIDE-based software) to access the device memory of the Voodoo Graphics
     and VoodooII 3D accelerators created by 3Dfx, Inc.  This provides an
     interface for applications based on the GLIDE API or that simply use the
     API provided by the linux /dev/3dfx device to use the video device.

     Supports all cards based on the following chipsets:

           3Dfx Voodoo Graphics
           3Dfx Voodoo II

     Specifically, the following cards should work:

           Diamond Multimedia Monster 3D
           Diamond Multimedia Monster 3D II

     Note that this driver does not currently have support for the Voodoo
     Banshee, Voodoo3, Voodoo5, or Voodoo6 based cards.  It also does not
     currently support the Voodoo Rush.  It also does not yet handle the SLI
     feature of the Voodoo II boards.  You can only use each of them
     separately.

     By including tdfx_linux, you can enable the linux ioctl code for this
     driver, where the only supported applications currently reside.

FILES
     /dev/3dfx     Symlinked to default 3dfx board
     /dev/3dfx*    Character Device programming interface

     /dev/voodoo   Mirrors of above interfaces
     /dev/voodoo*  (Some apps use /dev/voodoo)

HISTORY
     The tdfx driver appeared in FreeBSD 5.0, and was originally developed for
     Linux kernel 2.0.x, later written for 2.2.x and 2.4.x.

AUTHORS
     The driver was developed by Coleman Kane <cokane@micro.ti.com> after the
     linux version of this driver by Darryll Straus, John Taylor, Jens Axboe,
     Carlo Wood <carlo@alinoe.com> and Joseph Kain <joseph@3dfx.com> to be
     directly compatible with it and support the many GLIDE based games
     available for Linux and UNIX.
