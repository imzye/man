GRE(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 GRE(4)

NAME
     gre – encapsulating network device

SYNOPSIS
     To compile the driver into the kernel, place the following line in the
     kernel configuration file:

           device gre

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_gre_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The gre network interface pseudo device encapsulates datagrams into IP.
     These encapsulated datagrams are routed to a destination host, where they
     are decapsulated and further routed to their final destination.  The
     “tunnel” appears to the inner datagrams as one hop.

     gre interfaces are dynamically created and destroyed with the ifconfig(8)
     create and destroy subcommands.

     This driver corresponds to RFC 2784.  Encapsulated datagrams are
     prepended an outer datagram and a GRE header.  The GRE header specifies
     the type of the encapsulated datagram and thus allows for tunneling other
     protocols than IP.  GRE mode is also the default tunnel mode on Cisco
     routers.  gre also supports Cisco WCCP protocol, both version 1 and
     version 2.

     The gre interfaces support a number of additional parameters to the
     ifconfig(8):

     grekey       Set the GRE key used for outgoing packets.  A value of 0
                  disables the key option.

     enable_csum  Enables checksum calculation for outgoing packets.

     enable_seq   Enables use of sequence number field in the GRE header for
                  outgoing packets.

     udpencap     Enables UDP-in-GRE encapsulation (see the GRE-IN-UDP
                  ENCAPSULATION Section below for details).

     udpport      Set the source UDP port for outgoing packets.  A value of 0
                  disables the persistence of source UDP port for outgoing
                  packets.  See the GRE-IN-UDP ENCAPSULATION Section below for
                  details.

GRE-IN-UDP ENCAPSULATION
     The gre supports GRE in UDP encapsulation as defined in RFC 8086.  A GRE
     in UDP tunnel offers the possibility of better performance for load-
     balancing GRE traffic in transit networks.  Encapsulating GRE in UDP
     enables use of the UDP source port to provide entropy to ECMP hashing.

     The GRE in UDP tunnel uses single value 4754 as UDP destination port.
     The UDP source port contains a 14-bit entropy value that is generated by
     the encapsulator to identify a flow for the encapsulated packet.  The
     udpport option can be used to disable this behaviour and use single
     source UDP port value.  The value of udpport should be within the
     ephemeral port range, i.e., 49152 to 65535 by default.

     Note that a GRE in UDP tunnel is unidirectional; the tunnel traffic is
     not expected to be returned back to the UDP source port values used to
     generate entropy.  This may impact NAPT (Network Address Port Translator)
     middleboxes.  If such tunnels are expected to be used on a path with a
     middlebox, the tunnel can be configured either to disable use of the UDP
     source port for entropy or to enable middleboxes to pass packets with UDP
     source port entropy.

EXAMPLES
     192.168.1.* --- Router A  -------tunnel-------- Router B --- 192.168.2.*
                        \                              /
                         \                            /
                          +------ the Internet ------+

     Assuming router A has the (external) IP address A and the internal
     address 192.168.1.1, while router B has external address B and internal
     address 192.168.2.1, the following commands will configure the tunnel:

     On router A:

           ifconfig greN create
           ifconfig greN inet 192.168.1.1 192.168.2.1
           ifconfig greN inet tunnel A B
           route add -net 192.168.2 -netmask 255.255.255.0 192.168.2.1

     On router B:

           ifconfig greN create
           ifconfig greN inet 192.168.2.1 192.168.1.1
           ifconfig greN inet tunnel B A
           route add -net 192.168.1 -netmask 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1

     In case when internal and external IP addresses are the same, different
     routing tables (FIB) should be used.  The default FIB will be applied to
     IP packets before GRE encapsulation.  After encapsulation GRE interface
     should set different FIB number to outgoing packet.  Then different FIB
     will be applied to such encapsulated packets.  According to this FIB
     packet should be routed to tunnel endpoint.

     Host X -- Host A (198.51.100.1) ---tunnel--- Cisco D (203.0.113.1) -- Host E
                        \                                   /
                         \                                 /
                          +----- Host B ----- Host C -----+
                            (198.51.100.254)

     On Host A (FreeBSD):

     First of multiple FIBs should be configured via loader.conf:

           net.fibs=2
           net.add_addr_allfibs=0

     Then routes to the gateway and remote tunnel endpoint via this gateway
     should be added to the second FIB:

           route add -net 198.51.100.0 -netmask 255.255.255.0 -fib 1 -iface em0
           route add -host 203.0.113.1 -fib 1 198.51.100.254

     And GRE tunnel should be configured to change FIB for encapsulated
     packets:

           ifconfig greN create
           ifconfig greN inet 198.51.100.1 203.0.113.1
           ifconfig greN inet tunnel 198.51.100.1 203.0.113.1 tunnelfib 1

NOTES
     The MTU of gre interfaces is set to 1476 by default, to match the value
     used by Cisco routers.  This may not be an optimal value, depending on
     the link between the two tunnel endpoints.  It can be adjusted via
     ifconfig(8).

     For correct operation, the gre device needs a route to the decapsulating
     host that does not run over the tunnel, as this would be a loop.

     The kernel must be set to forward datagrams by setting the
     net.inet.ip.forwarding sysctl(8) variable to non-zero.

     By default, gre tunnels may not be nested.  This behavior may be modified
     at runtime by setting the sysctl(8) variable net.link.gre.max_nesting to
     the desired level of nesting.

BUGS
     The current implementation uses the key only for outgoing packets.
     Incoming packets with a different key or without a key will be treated as
     if they would belong to this interface.

     The sequence number field also used only for outgoing packets.
