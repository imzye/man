ELF_HASH(3)            FreeBSD Library Functions Manual            ELF_HASH(3)

NAME
     elf_hash – compute a hash value for a string

LIBRARY
     ELF Access Library (libelf, -lelf)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <libelf.h>

     unsigned long
     elf_hash(const char *name);

DESCRIPTION
     Function elf_hash() computes a portable hash value for the null
     terminated string pointed to by argument name.

     The hash value returned is will be identical across machines of different
     architectures.  This allows hash tables to be built on one machine and
     correctly used on another of a different architecture.  The hash value
     returned is also guaranteed not to be the bit pattern of all ones (~0UL).

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
     The library internally uses unsigned 32 bit arithmetic to compute the
     hash value.
