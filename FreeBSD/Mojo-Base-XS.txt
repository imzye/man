NAME
       Mojo::Base::XS - very fast Mojo-styled accessors

SYNOPSIS
           # Replace Mojo::Base
           use Mojo::Base::XS -infect;
           package Foo;
           use Mojo::Base;

           has foo => 'bar';
           has [qw/x y z/] => 42;
           has foo_defaults => sub { Bar->new };

           # Or use as standalone accessor generator
           package Bar;
           use Mojo::Base::XS;

           has bar => 'bar';
           has [qw/x y z/] => 42;
           has bar_defaults => sub { Baz->new };

       Mojo::Base::XS also allows you to run existing applications without any
       modifications:

           perl -MMojo::Base::XS=-infect script/your_app

DESCRIPTION
       Mojo::Base::XS implements fast accessrors for Mojo-based software.
       Code based on Class::XSAccessor - fastes Perl accessors.

       It can also be used as standalone Mojo-style accessors generator.

EXPORTS
       Mojo::Base::XS exports following functions:

   has
           has 'name';
           has [qw/name1 name2 name3/];
           has name => 'foo';
           has name => sub {...};
           has [qw/name1 name2 name3/] => 'foo';
           has [qw/name1 name2 name3/] => sub {...};

       Create attributes, just like the attr method.

FUNCTIONS
       Mojo::Base::XS implements following functions:

   newxs_attr
           newxs_attr('Class', 'attr');
           Class->attr(foo => 'bar');
           print Class->foo; # bar

       Installs XS attribute generator subroutine

   newxs_constructor
           newxs_attr('Class', 'new');
           Class->new(foo => 'bar');
           print Class->{foo}; # bar

       Installs XS constructor

   accessor, accessor_init, constructor, constructor_init
       Inherited from Class::XSAccessors for internal use

METHODS
       Mojo::Base::XS implements following methods:

   "new"
           my $obj = Class->new;
           my $obj = Class->new(name => 'value');
           my $obj = Class->new({name => 'value'});

       This base class provides a basic object constructor.  You can pass it
       either a hash or a hash reference with attribute values.

   "attr"
           __PACKAGE__->attr('name');
           __PACKAGE__->attr([qw/name1 name2 name3/]);
           __PACKAGE__->attr(name                    => 'foo');
           __PACKAGE__->attr(name                    => sub {...});
           __PACKAGE__->attr([qw/name1 name2 name3/] => 'foo');
           __PACKAGE__->attr([qw/name1 name2 name3/] => sub {...});

       Create attributes.  An arrayref can be used to create more than one
       attribute.  Pass an optional second argument to set a default value, it
       should be a constant or a sub reference.  The sub reference will be
       excuted at accessor read time if there's no set value.
