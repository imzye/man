ADVANCED PLAYER COMMANDS
       l      List the contents of the current playlist. Provide a numerical
              argument (e.g., :l25) to specify the maximum number of songs
              printed. The default value is 30.

              lh     List from the head of the playlist.

              lt     List from the tail of the playlist.

              lr     List from the current position the playlist. (default)

       j      Jump to a new position in the playlist. Provide a numerical
              argument (e.g., :j34) to specify the location. The jump has an
              effect similar to next (i.e., increased skip count). To jump
              without updating the play statistics for the skipped song,
              substitute 'j' with 'J'.

              js     Jump to a location based on SongID.

              jo     Jump to a location based on Order. (default)

       ,      Seek backward a specified number of seconds. (e.g., :,50)

       .      Seek forward a specified number of seconds. (e.g., :.50)

       a      Add song(s) to the temporary playlist currently playing. By
              default, the songs will be added to the location directly
              following the current song. Songs can be specified by name, ID,
              or all songs by particular artists, albums, or genres may be
              added using a similar syntax to the edit menu. :a [s | a | r |
              g] [unique name | id]. (e.g., :a r special_artist)

              ao     Specify the destination of the added songs. (e.g. To add
                     special_song at order 12, :ao 12 s special_song)

       r      Remove song(s) from the temporary playlist currently playing.
              Syntax is the same as the add command.

              ro     Remove a single song at the specified order.

       w      Save the current playlist. This command will overwrite any
              playlist previously saved with this command.
