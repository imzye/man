NAME
     dc – DEC/Intel 21143 and clone 10/100 Ethernet driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device miibus
           device dc

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_dc_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The dc driver provides support for several PCI Fast Ethernet adapters and
     embedded controllers based on the DEC/Intel 21143 chipset and clones.

     All of supported chipsets have the same general register layout, DMA
     descriptor format and method of operation.  All of the clone chips are
     based on the 21143 design with various modifications.  The 21143 itself
     has support for 10baseT, BNC, AUI, MII and symbol media attachments, 10
     and 100Mbps speeds in full or half duplex, built in NWAY autonegotiation
     and wake on LAN.  The 21143 also offers several receive filter
     programming options including perfect filtering, inverse perfect
     filtering and hash table filtering.

     Some clone chips duplicate the 21143 fairly closely while others only
     maintain superficial similarities.  Some support only MII media
     attachments.  Others use different receiver filter programming
     mechanisms.  At least one supports only chained DMA descriptors (most
     support both chained descriptors and contiguously allocated fixed size
     rings).  Some chips (especially the PNIC) also have peculiar bugs.  The
     dc driver does its best to provide generalized support for all of these
     chipsets in order to keep special case code to a minimum.

     These chips are used by many vendors which makes it difficult to provide
     a complete list of all supported cards.

     The dc driver supports the following media types:

     autoselect       Enable autoselection of the media type and options.  The
                      user can manually override the autoselected mode by
                      adding media options to the /etc/rc.conf file.

                      Note: the built-in NWAY autonegotiation on the original
                      PNIC 82c168 chip is horribly broken and is not supported
                      by the dc driver at this time (see the BUGS section for
                      details).  The original 82c168 appears on very early
                      revisions of the LinkSys LNE100TX and Matrox FastNIC.

     10baseT/UTP      Set 10Mbps operation.  The mediaopt option can also be
                      used to enable full-duplex operation.  Not specifying
                      full-duplex implies half-duplex mode.

     100baseTX        Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.  The mediaopt
                      option can also be used to enable full-duplex operation.
                      Not specifying full-duplex implies half-duplex mode.

     The dc driver supports the following media options:

     full-duplex      Force full duplex operation.  The interface will operate
                      in half duplex mode if this media option is not
                      specified.

     Note that the 100baseTX media type may not be available on certain Intel
     21143 adapters which support 10Mbps media attachments only.  For more
     information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

DIAGNOSTICS
     dc%d: couldn't map ports/memory  A fatal initialization error has
     occurred.

     dc%d: couldn't map interrupt  A fatal initialization error has occurred.

     dc%d: watchdog timeout  A packet was queued for transmission and a
     transmit command was issued, but the device failed to acknowledge the
     transmission before a timeout expired.  This can happen if the device is
     unable to deliver interrupts for some reason, of if there is a problem
     with the network connection (cable or network equipment) that results in
     a loss of link.

     dc%d: no memory for rx list  The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for
     the receiver ring.

     dc%d: TX underrun -- increasing TX threshold  The device generated a
     transmit underrun error while attempting to DMA and transmit a packet.
     This happens if the host is not able to DMA the packet data into the
     NIC's FIFO fast enough.  The driver will dynamically increase the
     transmit start threshold so that more data must be DMAed into the FIFO
     before the NIC will start transmitting it onto the wire.

     dc%d: TX underrun -- using store and forward mode  The device continued
     to generate transmit underruns even after all possible transmit start
     threshold settings had been tried, so the driver programmed the chip for
     store and forward mode.  In this mode, the NIC will not begin
     transmission until the entire packet has been transferred into its FIFO
     memory.

     dc%d: chip is in D3 power state -- setting to D0  This message applies
     only to adapters which support power management.  Some operating systems
     place the controller in low power mode when shutting down, and some PCI
     BIOSes fail to bring the chip out of this state before configuring it.
     The controller loses all of its PCI configuration in the D3 state, so if
     the BIOS does not set it back to full power mode in time, it will not be
     able to configure it correctly.  The driver tries to detect this
     condition and bring the adapter back to the D0 (full power) state, but
     this may not be enough to return the driver to a fully operational
     condition.  If you see this message at boot time and the driver fails to
     attach the device as a network interface, you will have to perform a
     second warm boot to have the device properly configured.

     Note that this condition only occurs when warm booting from another
     operating system.  If you power down your system prior to booting
     FreeBSD, the card should be configured correctly.

HISTORY
     The dc device driver first appeared in FreeBSD 4.0.

AUTHORS
     The dc driver was written by Bill Paul <wpaul@ee.columbia.edu>.

BUGS
     The Macronix application notes claim that in order to put the chips in
     normal operation, the driver must write a certain magic number into the
     CSR16 register.  The numbers are documented in the app notes, but the
     exact meaning of the bits is not.

     The 98713A seems to have a problem with 10Mbps full duplex mode.  The
     transmitter works but the receiver tends to produce many unexplained
     errors leading to very poor overall performance.  The 98715A does not
     exhibit this problem.  All other modes on the 98713A seem to work
     correctly.

     The original 82c168 PNIC chip has built in NWAY support which is used on
     certain early LinkSys LNE100TX and Matrox FastNIC cards, however it is
     horribly broken and difficult to use reliably.  Consequently,
     autonegotiation is not currently supported for this chipset: the driver
     defaults the NIC to 10baseT half duplex, and it is up to the operator to
     manually select a different mode if necessary.  (Later cards use an
     external MII transceiver to implement NWAY autonegotiation and work
     correctly.)

     The dc driver programs 82c168 and 82c169 PNIC chips to use the store and
     forward setting for the transmit start threshold by default.  This is to
     work around problems with some NIC/PCI bus combinations where the PNIC
     can transmit corrupt frames when operating at 100Mbps, probably due to
     PCI DMA burst transfer errors.

     The 82c168 and 82c169 PNIC chips also have a receiver bug that sometimes
     manifests during periods of heavy receive and transmit activity, where
     the chip will improperly DMA received frames to the host.  The chips
     appear to upload several kilobytes of garbage data along with the
     received frame data, dirtying several RX buffers instead of just the
     expected one.  The dc driver detects this condition and will salvage the
     frame; however, it incurs a serious performance penalty in the process.

     The PNIC chips also sometimes generate a transmit underrun error when the
     driver attempts to download the receiver filter setup frame, which can
     result in the receive filter being incorrectly programmed.  The dc driver
     will watch for this condition and requeue the setup frame until it is
     transferred successfully.

     The ADMtek AL981 chip (and possibly the AN985 as well) has been observed
     to sometimes wedge on transmit: this appears to happen when the driver
     queues a sequence of frames which cause it to wrap from the end of the
     transmit descriptor ring back to the beginning.  The dc driver attempts
     to avoid this condition by not queuing any frames past the end of the
     transmit ring during a single invocation of the dc_start() routine.  This
     workaround has a negligible impact on transmit performance.
