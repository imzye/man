NAME
       xfishtank - Fish swimming across your Root Window

SYNOPSIS
       xfishtank [-c <color>] [-b <limit>] [-f <limit>] [-i <mult>] [-r
       <rate>] [-m <num>] [-C <num>] [-d] [-p <file>] [host:display]

DESCRIPTION
       xfishtank is a animation program to simulate an Aquarium on your X
       desktop.

       Each fish can have up to 255 colors, but on startup the program takes
       all the colors from all the fish, and squeezes them down to all fit
       into the default colormap as best it can.  Any fish can be any size in
       width and height.  To make them look more like they are swimming, fish
       are animated (Very simple 2 frame animation). Fish CANNOT swim over
       each other, they will turn around if they are about to collide.
