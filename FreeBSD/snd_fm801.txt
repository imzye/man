NAME
     snd_fm801 – Forte Media FM801 bridge device driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device sound
           device snd_fm801

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           snd_fm801_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The snd_fm801 bridge driver allows the generic audio driver, sound(4), to
     attach audio devices based on the Forte Media FM801 chipset.  This is a
     common chipset found in various parts used by OEM manufacturers.

HARDWARE
     The snd_fm801 driver supports audio devices based on the following
     chipset:

     •   Forte Media FM801

SEE ALSO
     sound(4)

HISTORY
     The snd_fm801 device driver first appeared in FreeBSD 4.2.

BUGS
     The Forte Media FM801 chipset is a sort of PCI bridge, not an actual
     sound controller, making it possible to have soundless support.  One
     problem is that both chipsets, with and without sound support, use the
     same PCI ID.  This makes it impossible to determine which one is
     installed.
