WWW::Search::AltaVista(3)                  User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       WWW::Search::AltaVista - class for searching www.altavista.com

SYNOPSIS
           require WWW::Search;
           $search = new WWW::Search('AltaVista');

DESCRIPTION
       This class is an AltaVista specialization of WWW::Search.  It handles
       making and interpreting AltaVista searches http://www.altavista.com.

       This class exports no public interface; all interaction should be done
       through WWW::Search objects.

OPTIONS
       The default is "any of these words" (OR of query terms).

       aqa=all+of+these+words
               Add the AND of these words to the query.

       aqp=this+exact+phrase
               Add "this exact phrase" to the query.

       aqo=any+of+these+words
               Add the OR of these words to the query.  This is where the
               query is placed by default.

       aqn=none+of+these+words
               Add NOT these words to the query.

       aqb=(boolean+AND+expression)+NEAR+entry
               Add a boolean expression to the query.  Operators are AND, OR,
               AND NOT, and NEAR.  In the browser interface, the boolean
               expression can not be combined with any other query types
               listed above.  You should probably build the boolean expression
               with parentheses and spaces and urlescape it.

       aqs=these+words
               Pages containing "these words" will be ranked highest.

       kgs=[0,1]
               To restrict the search to U.S. websites, set kgs=1.  The
               default is world-wide, kgs=0.

       kls=[0,1]
               To restrict the search to pages in English and Spanish, set
               kls=1.  The default is no language restrictions, kls=0.

       filetype=[html,pdf]
               To restrict the search to HTML pages only, set filetype=html.
               To restrict the search to PDF pages only, set filetype=pdf.
               The default is no restriction on page type, filetype=.

       rc=dmn&swd=net+org+or.jp
               To restrict the search to pages from certain domains, set
               rc=dmn and set swd to a list of desired toplevel domains.

       rc=url&lh=www.sandcrawler.com/SWB
               To restrict the search to pages from a particular site, set
               rc=url and set lh to the site name and path.  Leave off the
               http:// from the site.

PUBLIC METHODS
   gui_query
       Call this instead of native_query() if you want to get the same results
       as your average Joe web surfer.

PRIVATE METHODS
   native_setup_search
       This private method does the heavy lifting after you call
       native_query() or gui_query().

   parse_tree
       This private method does the hard work of parsing the results out of
       the HTML.
