DESCRIPTION
       Qpopper is a POP3 server to enable POP3 clients to read and download
       mail. This server implements the POP protocol defined in RFC 1939 and
       the RFC 2449 extensions.  This implementation runs on a variety of Unix
       platforms, including Linux.

       The server also enables clients to send mail using XTND XMIT, which is
       processed via sendmail(8).

OPTIONS
       [address][:][port]
              If compiled as a standalone daemon (instead of being run from
              inetd), you can can specify the IP address and/or port number to
              bind to at run-time as parameter 1, e.g., 'popper
              199.46.50.7:8110 -S' or 'popper 8110 -S -T600'.  If IPv6 support
              is compiled in, address can be also IPv6 address by enclosing
              the address with `[' and `]'.  If not specified, the IP address
              defaults to all available.  The default port is 110 except when
              _DEBUG (not simply DEBUG) is defined, then it is 8765.

              See the Administrator's Guide file for more information on
              standalone mode.

       -b bulldir
              Turns on the bulletin feature and specifies the bulletin
              directory path.  The command line overrides the compiled value
              if it is defined.  To enable bulletins by default and specify a
              default bulletin directory during compilation, include the
              --enable-bulletins=bull-directory flag when running ./configure.
              The usual bulletin directory is /var/spool/bulls.

              A bulletin database can be used to track the bulletins instead
              of the users' home directory.  This feature is enabled by
              including the --enable-bulldb=bull-directory flag when running
              ./configure.

       -c     Downcases user names.  This permits users to configure their
              clients with user names in UPPER or MiXeD case, and still login,
              assuming their actual user name is all lower case.

       -d     Turns on debug logging if compiled (pass --enable-debugging to
              ./configure).  All debugging information is saved using
              syslog(8).  If this option is used, it should be first, so that
              debug records are generated for subsequent options.

       -D drac-host
              If compiled with --enable-drac, specifies the drac host.
              Defaults to localhost.

       -e x=value,...
              Sets POP3 extensions.  Sets x to the specified value.  Used to
              include Login Delay and/or Expire response tags to the CAPA
              command.

              Remember neither Expire nor Login Delay is enforced by qpopper;
              Sysadmins have to implement them by some other means.  However,
              you can enforce EXPIRE 0 (no retention at all) by using the
              --enable-auto-delete flag with ./configure.  This causes
              messages to be automatically deleted after they are downloaded.

       -f config-file
              Reads additional run-time options from config-file.  See
              Config-File Options for option names and syntax.

       -k     Enables Kerberos authentication when qpopper has been compiled
              with --with-kerberos5.  You must already have libraries that
              support Kerberos.

       -K service
              The specified Kerberos service is used instead of the compiled-
              in value.  The default is rcmd, but pop is also common.

       -l 0|1|2
              Sets TLS/SSL handling.  Must have compiled with OpenSSL or SSL
              Plus.

              0 is the default.  TLS/SSL is not supported.

              1 enables the STLS command.  This permits a client to attempt
              TLS/SSL negotiation after connecting.

              2 Causes Qpopper to attempt TLS negotiation when a client first
              connects.  This is for alternate-port support.

       -p 0|1|2|3|4
              Sets plain-text password handling options.  To use this option,
              you must have an alternative to plain-text passwords available,
              such as APOP.

              0 is the default, which permits plain-text passwords only for
              those users who are not in the APOP database.

              1 disables plain-text passwords for all users, even those who
              are not in the APOP database.

              2 permits plain-text passwords for all users, even those who are
              in the APOP database (this allows clients to fall back on plain-
              text authentication if they do not support APOP).

              3 allows plain-text passwords only for connections on the
              loop-back (127.*.*.*) address.

              4 permits plain-text passwords only if TLS/SSL has been
              negotiated for the session (requires an executable compiled with
              OpenSSL or SSL Plus).


       -R     Disables reverse lookups on client IP addresses.

       -t trace-file
              Turns on debug logging if compiled (pass --enable-debugging to
              ./configure) and writes the trace information in trace-file
              using fprintf(3V).  If this option is used, it should be first,
              so that debug records are generated for subsequent options.

       -s     Turns on statistics logging using syslog(8) or trace-file.  At
              the end of each popper session, the following information is
              logged: username, number of messages deleted, number of bytes
              deleted, number of message left on server, number of bytes left
              on server.

       -S     Enables server mode.  This mode reduces disk I/O and disk space
              usage when popper is used on a system that serves POP only users
              exclusively.

       -T timeout
              option changes the default compiled value POP_TIMEOUT for
              terminating a session with a pop client.

              When the server is waiting for a command to arrive from the
              client, it times out after the specified number of seconds and
              terminates the session.  This avoids having popper processes
              hang forever waiting for command input from clients which have
              terminated abnormally or are hung.

              A small value is ok for small to medium networks where the
              network delay is within a few seconds.  In this case 15-30
              seconds is not unreasonable.  Networks with large delays in
              sending packets (e.g., SLIP links) may require a larger value.
              In this case 300 seconds (5 minutes) is not unreasonable.

              Note that RFC 1939 requires a minimum of 600 second (10
              minutes).

       -u     After a user authenticates, process options from a file called
              .qpopper-options in the user's home directory.  This file can be
              owned by and writable by the user.

       -U     After a user authenticates, process options from a file called
              .<user>.qpopper-options in the spool directory, where <user> is
              the user name.  This file should not be owned by nor writable by
              the user.

       -v     Report the current version and exit.

       -V     Report the current version and exit.

       -x     Disable use of XTND XMIT.  NOTE: Administrators are strongly
              encouraged to disable XTND XMIT in favor of mechanisms such as
              SMTP AUTH.

       -y  log-facility


       Processing Options are described below.

   Processing Options
       Here  are some options the values of which are announced to clients.
       Syntax of the options is:

                      opt=value,...

       This sets option opt to be value.  Multiple options can be specified at
       one instance and are comma separated.

       The following are the options supported:
              login_delay
              expire

   Config-File Options
       You can set Qpopper run-time options either from the command line or in
       a configuration file.

       Configuration files use different option names and a different syntax
       than the command-line (because command-line options are limited to one
       character).

       The general syntax of the config file (in ABNF) is:

           config-line  ::= comment-line / reset-line / set-line

           comment-line ::= "#" <comment-text to end of line>

           reset-line   ::= "reset" boolean-option

           set-line     ::= implicit-set / explicit-set

           explicit-set ::= "set" option "=" value

           implicit-set ::= "set" boolean-option

           option       ::= boolean-option / integer-option /
                            string-option / mnemonic-option

           value        ::= "true" / "false" / integer / name

           string       ::= <"> 1*255 CHAR <">

           CHAR         ::= <any printable character except space or tab>

       In other words the line starts with set or reset, then an option name,
       and either ends there or has an = followed by a value.

       A comment line starts with #.  The rest of the line is ignored.  You
       can also use # to end any line.  Everything else on the line is a
       comment.

       Note that reset can only be used with boolean options.  The = and the
       value are omitted when reset is used.  When set is used with a boolean
       option, you can omit the = and value if you wish (it defaults to true),
       or you can use any of the four values true, false, 1, or 0.

       Some options are "restricted", meaning that they can't be used in a
       .qpopper-options file in a user's home directory and/or in a
       <user>.qpopper-options file in the spool directory.

       The following are the command line options you can use:

                  the APOP database.

           local  Clear-text passwords are permitted only when the client
                  connects through the local interface (127.*.*.*).

           tls    Clear-text passwords are permitted when TLS/SSL has been
                  negotiated for the session.  Available only if compiled with

BULLETINS
       The bulletin feature gives system administrators a way to send
       important announcements to all POP users without having to do mass
       mailings.

       The bulletin directory contains one file per bulletin. Each file
       contains a single mail message with a header and body in normal mailbox
       format. The first line of each such bulletin must be a "From " line.
       The easiest way for sysadmins to create such bulletins is to mail
       themselves a copy of the bulletin using the account to which they want
       replies to be sent, then use their mail program to save the message to
       a file in the bulletin directory in mailbox format. The bulletin
       directory must be world readable.

       The name of each bulletin file begins with the bulletin number, and may
       optionally continue with any other characters. E.g., the file name of
       bulletin number 23 might be "23.pophost_down_sunday".

       Popper creates a file named .popbull in the home directory of each
       user.  This file contains a single line recording the highest numbered
       bulletin received by the user.

       Each time a POP client connects to the server, any new bulletins which
       the user has not received previously are automatically appended to the
       user's mail.

       When a bulletin is copied, the "To" header line is replaced by "To:
       username@thishost", and any "Status:" header lines are deleted.
       Otherwise, the bulletin is copied as is.

       When a new user checks for mail the first time, popper creates the
       .popbull file in the user's home directory and seeds it with the
       current maximum bulletin number. Thus new users do not get old
       bulletins.

       Bulletins can be enabled by default, and the bulletin directory
       specified, by including the --enable-bulletins=bull-directory flag when
       running ./configure.

       To use a database instead of .popbull files in users' home directories
       for tracking the highest bulletin seen by a user, include the --enable-
       bulldb=bull-directory flag when running ./configure.  You must also
       create two empty files in the bulletin directory, called bulldb.pag and
       bulldb.dir.  When a bulletin database is used, qpopper checks for and
       uses any .popbull files in the user's home directory, to provide
       continuity.

       To specify the maximum number of bulletins sent to new users, include
       the --with-new-bulls flag when running ./configure.  For example,
       --with-new-bulls=10 says that new users get at most ten bulletins.


THE POP TRANSACTION CYCLE
       The Qpopper server is a single program (called popper) that is launched
       by inetd when it gets a service request on the POP TCP port.  (The
       official port number specified in RFC 1939 for POP version 3 is port
       110.  However, some POP3 clients attempt to contact the server at port
       109, the POP version 2 port.  Unless you are running both POP2 and POP3
       servers, you can simply define both ports for use by the POP3 server.
       This is explained in the installation instructions later on.)

       The qpopper program initializes and verifies that the peer IP address
       is registered in the local domain (unless the -R command-line option is
       used), logging a warning message when a connection is made with a
       client whose IP address does not have a canonical name.  For systems
       using BSD 4.3 bind, it also checks to see if a canonical name lookup
       for the client returns the same peer IP address, logging a warning
       message if it does not.

       The server enters the authorization state, during which the client must
       correctly identify itself by providing a valid Unix userid and password
       on the server's host machine (or successfully authenticate using APOP
       or AUTH).  No other exchanges are allowed during this state (other than
       a request to quit.)  If authentication fails, a warning message is
       logged and the session ends.

       Once the user is identified, qpopper changes its user and group ids to
       match that of the user and enters the transaction state.  The server
       makes a temporary copy of the user's maildrop which is used for all
       subsequent transactions (unless running in server mode ).  These
       include the bulk of POP commands to retrieve mail, delete mail,
       undelete mail, and so forth.

       When the client quits, the server enters the final update state, during
       which the network connection is terminated and the user's maildrop is
       updated with the (possibly) modified temporary maildrop.


LOGGING
       The POP server uses syslog to keep a record of its activities.  On
       systems with BSD 4.3 syslogging, the server logs (by default) to the
       "local0" facility at priority "notice" for all messages except
       debugging which is logged at priority "debug".  The default log file is
       /var/log/messages.  These can be changed, if desired.  On systems with
       4.2 syslogging all messages are logged to the local log file, usually
       /usr/spool/mqueue/syslog.


DEBUGGING
       Qpopper logs debugging information when the -d parameter is specified
       after its invocation in the inetd.conf file.  Care should be exercised
       in using this option since it generates considerable output in the
       syslog file.  Alternatively, the "-t <file-name>" option places
       debugging information into file "<file-name>" using fprintf instead of
       syslog.

       For SunOS version 3.5, the popper program is launched by inetd from
       /etc/servers.  This file does not allow you to specify command line
       arguments.  Therefore, if you want to enable debugging, you can specify
       a shell script in /etc/servers to be launched instead of popper and in
       this script call popper with the desired arguments.

       You can confirm that the POP server is running on Unix by telneting to
       port 110 (or 109 if you set it up that way).  For example:

       %telnet pop.qualcomm.com 110
       Trying...
       Connected to pop.qualcomm.com.
       Escape character is '^]'.
       +OK QPOP (version 3.0) at pop.qualcomm.com starting.
       quit
       +OK Pop server at pop.qualcomm.com signing off.
       Connection closed by foreign host.


EXTENSIONS
       The server implements several extended commands.

       XTND XMIT: Sends a mail message using /usr/sbin/sendmail.

       XTND XLIST header [num]: Extracts and returns the specified header line
       for the specified message number. If the "num" parameter is missing,
       returns the header line for all the messages which are not currently
       marked for deletion.

       XMANGLE: Can be used as a modifier to the TOP, RETR, LIST commands. The
       result is to condense MIME messages into a single part. For example:

              RETR 10 XMANGLE(text=html;headers=to:,cc:,from:,date:)
       results in transforming message 10 into a single part of content-type
       text/html with only those headers which were requested.

       Qpopper also supports the "-no-mime" user name hack.  As a way to
       enable MIME-mangling with clients that do not support XMANGLE, add
       "-no-mime" to the user name.  For example, if the userid is "mary",
       enter it in the client as "mary-no-mime".
