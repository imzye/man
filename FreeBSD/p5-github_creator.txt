NAME
       github_creator - Create a Github repository for your Perl module

SYNOPSIS
       #edit ~/.github_creator.ini

       #Inside a git repo % github_creator

DESCRIPTION
       This is a short script you can run from within an existing git
       repository to create a remote repo on Github using a previously created
       account. This does not create Github accounts (and that violates the
       terms of service).

       It takes its information from META.yml. If the script doesn't find a
       META.yml, it tries to run `make metafile` to create one. Sorry, no
       Module::Build support just yet only because I don't need it yet.

       From META.yml it gets the module name and abstract, which it uses for
       the Github project name and description. It uses the CPAN Search page
       as the homepage (e.g. http://search.cpan.org/dist/Foo-Bar).

       Once it creates the remote repo, it adds a git remote named "origin"
       (unless you change that in the config), then pushes master to it.

       If Github sends back the right page, the script ends by printing the
       private git URL.

CONFIGURATION
       The configuration file is an INI file named .github_creator.ini which
       the script looks for in the current directory or your home directory
       (using the first one it finds).

       Example:

               [github]
               login_page="https://github.com/login"
               account=joe@example.com
               password=foobar
               remote_name=github
               debug=1

   Section [github]
       login_page (default = https://github.com/login)
           This shouldn't change, but what the hell. It's the only URL you
           need to know.

       account (default = GITHUB_USER environment var)
           Your account name, which is probably your email address.

       password (default = GITHUB_PASS environment var)
       remote_name (default = origin)
           I like to use "github" though.

       debug (default = 0)
           Do everything but don't actually create the Githun repo.

ISSUES
       The Github webserver seems to not return the right page every so often,
       so things might go wrong. Try again a couple times.

       Sometimes there is a delay in the availability of your new repo. This
       script sleeps a couple of seconds then tries to verify that the new
       repo is there. If it can't see it, look at Github first to see if it
       showed up.
