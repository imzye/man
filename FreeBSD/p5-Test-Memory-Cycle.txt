NAME
       Test::Memory::Cycle - Check for memory leaks and circular memory
       references

VERSION
       Version 1.06

SYNOPSIS
       Perl's garbage collection has one big problem: Circular references
       can't get cleaned up.  A circular reference can be as simple as two
       references that refer to each other:

           my $mom = {
               name => "Marilyn Lester",
           };

           my $me = {
               name => "Andy Lester",
               mother => $mom,
           };
           $mom->{son} = $me;

       "Test::Memory::Cycle" is built on top of "Devel::Cycle" to give you an
       easy way to check for these circular references.

           use Test::Memory::Cycle;

           my $object = new MyObject;
           # Do stuff with the object.
           memory_cycle_ok( $object );

       You can also use memory_cycle_exists() to make sure that you have a
       cycle where you expect to have one.

FUNCTIONS
   "memory_cycle_ok( $reference, $msg )"
       Checks that $reference doesn't have any circular memory references.

   "memory_cycle_exists( $reference, $msg )"
       Checks that $reference does have any circular memory references.

   "weakened_memory_cycle_ok( $reference, $msg )"
       Checks that $reference doesn't have any circular memory references, but
       unlike "memory_cycle_ok" this will also check for weakened cycles
       produced with Scalar::Util's "weaken".

   "weakened_memory_cycle_exists( $reference, $msg )"
       Checks that $reference does have any circular memory references, but
       unlike "memory_cycle_exists" this will also check for weakened cycles
       produced with Scalar::Util's "weaken".
