NAME
       dom - Create an in-memory DOM tree from XML

SYNOPSIS
       package require tdom

       dom method ?arg arg ...?
______________________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       This command provides the creation of DOM trees in memory. In the usual
       case a string containing a XML information is parsed and converted into
       a DOM tree. Other possible parse input may be HTML or JSON.  The method
       indicates a specific subcommand.

       The valid methods are:

       dom parse ?options? ?data?
              Parses the XML information and builds up the DOM tree in memory
              providing a Tcl object command to this DOM document object.
              Example:



                     dom parse $xml doc
                     $doc documentElement root

              parses the XML in the variable xml, creates the DOM tree in
              memory, make a reference to the document object, visible in Tcl
              as a document object command, and assigns this new object name
              to the variable doc. When doc gets freed, the DOM tree and the
              associated Tcl command object (document and all node objects)
              are freed automatically.




                     set document [dom parse $xml]
                     set root     [$document documentElement]

              parses the XML in the variable xml, creates the DOM tree in
              memory, make a reference to the document object, visible in Tcl
              as a document object command, and returns this new object name,
              which is then stored in document.  To free the underlying DOM
              tree and the associative Tcl object commands (document + nodes +
              fragment nodes) the document object command has to be explicitly
              deleted by:




                     $document delete

              or

                     rename $document ""

              The valid options are:

              -simple
                     If -simple is specified, a simple but fast parser is used
                     (conforms not fully to XML recommendation). That should
                     double parsing and DOM generation speed. The encoding of
                     the data is not transformed inside the parser. The simple
                     parser does not respect any encoding information in the
                     XML declaration. It skips over the internal DTD subset
                     and ignores any information in it. Therefore, it doesn't
                     include defaulted attribute values into the tree, even if
                     the according attribute declaration is in the internal
                     subset. It also doesn't expand internal or external
                     entity references other than the predefined entities and
                     character references

              -html  If -html is specified, a fast HTML parser is used, which
                     tries to even parse badly formed HTML into a DOM tree. If
                     the HTML document given to parse does not have a single
                     root element (as it was legal up to HTML 4.01) and the
                     -forest option is not used then a html node will be
                     inserted as document element, with the HTML input data
                     top level elements as children.

              -html5 This option is only available if tDOM was build with
                     --enable-html5. Use the featureinfo method if you need to
                     know if this feature is build in. If -html5 is specified,
                     the gumbo lib html5 parser
                     (https://github.com/google/gumbo-parser) is used to build
                     the DOM tree. This is, as far as it goes, XML namespace-
                     aware (which means for example that all HTML elements are
                     in the html5 namespace). Since this probably isn't wanted
                     by a lot of users and adds only burden for no good in a
                     lot of use cases -html5 can be combined with
                     -ignorexmlns, in which case all nodes and attributes in
                     the DOM tree are not in an XML namespace. All tag and
                     attribute names in the DOM tree will be lower case, even
                     for foreign elements not in the xhtml, svg or mathml
                     namespace.  The DOM tree may include nodes, that the
                     parser inserted because they are implied by the context
                     (as <head>, <tbody>, etc.). Input longer than 4 GByte
                     byte length is not supported by the underlying gumbo
                     parser.

              -json  If -json is specified, the data is expected to be a valid
                     JSON string (according to RFC 7159). The command returns
                     an ordinary DOM document with nesting token inside the
                     JSON data translated into tree hierarchy. If a JSON array
                     value is itself an object or array then container element
                     nodes named (in a default build) arraycontainer or
                     objectcontainer, respectively, are inserted into the
                     tree. The JSON serialization of this document (with the
                     domDoc method asJSON) is the same JSON information as the
                     data, preserving JSON datatypes, allowing non-unique
                     member names of objects while preserving their order and
                     the full range of JSON string values. JSON datatype
                     handling is done with an additional property "sticking"
                     at the doc and tree nodes. This property isn't contained
                     in an XML serialization of the document. If you need to
                     store the JSON data represented by a document, store the
                     JSON serialization and parse it back from there. Apart
                     from this JSON type information the returned doc command
                     or handle is an ordinary DOM doc, which may be
                     investigated or modified with the full range of the doc
                     and node methods. Please note that the element node names
                     and the text node values within the tree may be outside
                     of what the appropriate XML productions allow.

              -jsonroot <document element name>
                     If given makes the given element name the document
                     element of the resulting doc. The parsed content of the
                     JSON string will be the children of this document element
                     node.

              -jsonmaxnesting  integer
                     This option only has effect if used together with the
                     -json option. The current implementation uses a recursive
                     descent JSON parser.  In order to avoid using excess
                     stack space, any JSON input that has more than a certain
                     levels of nesting is considered invalid. The default
                     maximum nesting is 2000. The option -jsonmaxnesting
                     allows the user to adjust that.

              --     The option -- marks the end of options.  To give this
                     option isn't strictly necessary even in the case of JSON
                     parsing, for which valid data may start with a "-". If
                     parsing json and if the second to last or last argument
                     start with a "-" and isn't a known option name it will be
                     treated as JSON data.

              -keepEmpties
                     If -keepEmpties is specified then text nodes which
                     contain only whitespaces will be part of the resulting
                     DOM tree. In default case (-keepEmpties not given) those
                     empty text nodes are removed at parsing time.

              -keepCDATA
                     If -keepCDATA is specified then CDATA sections aren't
                     added to the tree as text nodes (and, if necessary,
                     combined with sibling text nodes into one text node) as
                     without this option but are added as CDATA_SECTION_NODEs
                     to the tree. Please note that the resulting tree isn't
                     prepared for XPath selects or to be the source or the
                     stylesheet of an XSLT transformation. If not combined
                     with -keepEmpties only not whitespace only CDATA sections
                     will be added to the resulting DOM tree.

              -channel  <channel-ID>
                     If -channel <channel-ID> is specified, the input to be
                     parsed is read from the specified channel. The encoding
                     setting of the channel (via fconfigure -encoding) is
                     respected, ie the data read from the channel are
                     converted to UTF-8 according to the encoding settings
                     before the data is parsed.

              -baseurl  <baseURI>
                     If -baseurl <baseURI> is specified, the baseURI is used
                     as the base URI of the document.  External entities
                     references in the document are resolved relative to this
                     base URI. This base URI is also stored within the DOM
                     tree.

              -feedbackAfter  <#bytes>
                     If -feedbackAfter <#bytes> is specified, the Tcl command
                     given by -feedbackcmd is evaluated at the first element
                     start within the document (or an external entity) after
                     the start of the document or external entity or the last
                     such call after #bytes. For backward compatibility if no
                     -feedbackcmd is given but there is a Tcl proc named
                     ::dom::domParseFeedback this proc is used as
                     -feedbackcmd. If there isn't such a proc and
                     -feedbackAfter is used it is an error to not also use
                     -feedbackcmd. If the called script raises error, then
                     parsing will be aborted, the dom parse call returns
                     error, with the script error msg as error msg.  If the
                     called script return -code break, the parsing will abort
                     and the dom parse call will return the empty string.

              -feedbackcmd  <script>
                     If -feedbackcmd <script> is specified, the script script
                     is evaluated at the first element start within the
                     document (or an external entity) after the start of the
                     document or external entity or the last such call after
                     #bytes value given by the -feedbackAfter option. If
                     -feedbackAfter isn't given, using this option doesn't has
                     any effect. If the called script raises error, then
                     parsing will be aborted, the dom parse call returns
                     error, with the script error msg as error msg. If the
                     called script return -code break, the parsing will abort
                     and the dom parse call will return the empty string.

              -externalentitycommand  <script>
                     If -externalentitycommand <script> is specified, the
                     specified Tcl script is called to resolve any external
                     entities of the document. The actual evaluated command
                     consists of this option followed by three arguments: the
                     base uri, the system identifier of the entity and the
                     public identifier of the entity. The base uri and the
                     public identifier may be the empty list. The script has
                     to return a Tcl list consisting of three elements. The
                     first element of this list signals how the external
                     entity is returned to the processor. Currently the two
                     allowed types are "string" and "channel". The second
                     element of the list has to be the (absolute) base URI of
                     the external entity to be parsed.  The third element of
                     the list are data, either the already read data out of
                     the external entity as string in the case of type
                     "string", or the name of a Tcl channel, in the case of
                     type "channel". Note that if the script returns a Tcl
                     channel, it will not be closed by the processor.  It must
                     be closed separately if it is no longer needed.

              -useForeignDTD  <boolean>
                     If <boolean> is true and the document does not have an
                     external subset, the parser will call the
                     -externalentitycommand script with empty values for the
                     systemId and publicID arguments. Please note that if the
                     document also doesn't have an internal subset, the
                     -startdoctypedeclcommand and -enddoctypedeclcommand
                     scripts, if set, are not called.

              -paramentityparsing  <always|never|notstandalone>
                     The -paramentityparsing option controls, if the parser
                     tries to resolve the external entities (including the
                     external DTD subset) of the document while building the
                     DOM tree.  -paramentityparsing requires an argument,
                     which must be either "always", "never", or
                     "notstandalone".  The value "always" means that the
                     parser tries to resolves (recursively) all external
                     entities of the XML source. This is the default in case
                     -paramentityparsing is omitted. The value "never" means
                     that only the given XML source is parsed and no external
                     entity (including the external subset) will be resolved
                     and parsed. The value "notstandalone" means, that all
                     external entities will be resolved and parsed, with the
                     exception of documents, which explicitly states
                     standalone="yes" in their XML declaration.

              -forest
                     If this option is given, there is no need for a single
                     root; any sequence of well-formed, balanced subtrees will
                     be parsed into a DOM tree. This works for the expat DOM
                     builder, the simple xml parser enabled with -simple and
                     the simple HTML parser enabled -with -html. If used
                     together with -json or -html5 this option is ignored.

              -ignorexmlns
                     It is recommended, that you only use this option with the
                     -html5 option. If this option is given, no node within
                     the created DOM tree will be internally marked as placed
                     into an XML Namespace, even if there is a default
                     namespace in scope for un-prefixed elements or even if
                     the element has a defined namespace prefix. One
                     consequence is that XPath node expressions on such a DOM
                     tree doesn't work as may be expected. Prefixed element
                     nodes can't be selected naively and element nodes without
                     prefix will be seen by XPath expressions as if they are
                     not in any namespace (no matter if they are in fact
                     should be in a default namespace). If you need to inject
                     prefixed node names into an XPath expression use the '%'
                     syntax described in the documentation of the of the

              domNode
                      command method >selectNodes.

                     <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack>
                     This option together with
                     -billionLaughsAttackProtectionActivationThreshold gives
                     control over the parser limits that protects against
                     billion laugh attacks ().  This option expects a float >=
                     1.0 as argument. You should never need to use this
                     option, because the default value (100.0) should work for
                     any real data.  If you ever need to increase this value
                     for non-attack payload, please report.

                     This option together with

       dom createDocument docElemName ?objVar?
              Creates a new DOM document object with one element node with
              node name docElemName. The objVar controls the memory handling
              as explained above.

       dom createDocumentNS uri docElemName ?objVar?
              Creates a new DOM document object with one element node with
              node name docElemName. Uri gives the namespace of the document
              element to create. The objVar controls the memory handling as
              explained above.

       dom createDocumentNode ?-jsonType jsonType? ?objVar?
              Creates a new 'empty' DOM document object without any element
              node. objVar controls the memory handling as explained above. If
              the option -jsonType is given the created document node will be
              of the given JSON type.

       dom createFromTypedList typedList ?objVar?

              Creates a new DOM document from the argument typedList.  The
              objVar argument controls the memory handling as explained above.

              The typedList argument must be a Tcl list and must follow the
              format of the output of the document command method asTypedList,
              see there.

       dom createNodeCmd ?-returnNodeCmd? ?-tagName name? ?-jsonType jsonType?
       ?-namespace URI? (element|comment|text|cdata|pi)Node commandName
              This method creates Tcl commands, which in turn create tDOM
              nodes. Tcl commands created by this command are only available
              inside a script given to the domNode methods appendFromScript or
              insertBeforeFromScript. If a command created with createNodeCmd
              is invoked in any other context, it will return error. The
              created command commandName replaces any existing command or
              procedure with that name. If the commandName includes any Tcl
              namespace qualifiers, it is created in the specified namespace.
              The -tagName option is only allowed for the elementNode type.
              The -jsonType option is only allowed for elementNode and
              textNode types.

              If such command is invoked inside a script given as argument to
              the domNode method appendFromScript or insertBeforeFromScript it
              creates a new node and appends this node at the end of the child
              list of the invoking element node. If the option -returnNodeCmd
              was given, the command returns the created node as Tcl command.
              If this option was omitted, the command returns nothing. Each
              command creates always the same type of node.  Which type of
              node is created by the command is determined by the first
              argument to the createNodeCmd. The syntax of the created command
              depends on the type of the node it creates.

              If the command type to create is elementNode, the created
              command will create an element node, if called. Without the
              -tagName option the tag name of the created node is commandName
              without Tcl namespace qualifiers. If the -tagName option was
              given then the created elements will have the value of this
              option as tag name. If the -jsonType option was given then the
              created node elements will have the given JSON type. If the
              -namespace option is given the created element node will be XML
              namespaced and in the namespace given by the option.  The
              element name will be literal as given either by the command name
              or the -tagname option, if that was given. An appropriate XML
              namespace declaration will be automatically added, to bind the
              prefix (if the element name has one) or the default namespace
              (if the element name hasn't a prefix) to the namespace if such a
              binding isn't in scope.

              The syntax of the created command is:




                     elementNodeCmd ?attributeName attributeValue ...? ?script?
                     elementNodeCmd ?-attributeName attributeValue ...? ?script?
                     elementNodeCmd name_value_list script


              The command syntax allows three different ways to specify the
              attributes of the resulting element. These could be specified
              with attributeName attributeValue argument pairs, in an "option
              style" way with -attriubteName attributeValue argument pairs
              (the '-' character is only syntactical sugar and will be
              stripped off) or as a Tcl list with elements interpreted as
              attribute name and the corresponding attribute value.  The
              attribute name elements in the list may have a leading '-'
              character, which will be stripped off.

              Every elementNodeCmd accepts an optional Tcl script as last
              argument. This script is evaluated as recursive appendFromScript
              script with the node created by the elementNodeCmd as parent of
              all nodes created by the script.

              If the first argument of the method is textNode, the command
              will create a text node. If the -jsonType option was given then
              the created text node will have that JSON type. The syntax of
              the created command is:




                     textNodeCmd ?-disableOutputEscaping? ?data?


              If the json type of the created text node is NULL, TRUE or FALSE
              then the data argument is optional, otherwise it this argument
              must be given.

              If the optional flag -disableOutputEscaping is given, the
              escaping of the ampersand character (&) and the left angle
              bracket (<) inside the data is disabled. You should use this
              flag carefully.

              If the first argument of the method is commentNode or cdataNode
              the command will create an comment node or CDATA section node.
              The syntax of the created command is:




                     nodeCmd data


              If the first argument of the method is piNode, the command will
              create a processing instruction node. The syntax of the created
              command is:




                     piNodeCmd target data


              Beside the with dom createNodeCmd calls created node commands
              there are two more commands which automatically insert nodes
              into the tree inside an appendFromScript script.




                     tdom::fsnewNode ?-jsonType <jsonType>? ?-namespace <namespace>? tagName ?attributes? ?script?


              If called inside a fromScript context this command creates a new
              node tagName in the XML namespace namespace if the -namespace
              option was given and with the JSON type jsonType if the
              -jsonType option was given and appends this node at the end of
              the child list of the invoking element node.  The attributes and
              script arguments will be processed as if given to an element
              creating node command. If called outside a fromScript context
              this command will raise error.




                     tdom::fsinsertNode node


              If called inside o fromScript context this comannd instead of
              creating a new node appends the as argument given node at the
              end of the child list of the invoking element node. The node is
              unlinked from its previous place. If called outside a fromScript
              context this command will raise error.

       dom setStoreLineColumn ?boolean?
              If switched on, the DOM nodes will contain line and column
              position information for the original XML document after
              parsing. The default is not to store line and column position
              information.

       dom setNameCheck ?boolean?
              If NameCheck is true, every method which expects an XML Name, a
              full qualified name or a processing instructing target will
              check, if the given string is valid according to its production
              rule. For commands created with the createNodeCmd method to be
              used in the context of appendFromScript the status of the flag
              at creation time decides. If NameCheck is true at creation time,
              the command will check its arguments, otherwise not. The
              setNameCheck set this flag. It returns the current NameCheck
              flag state. The default state for NameCheck is true.

       dom setTextCheck ?boolean?
              If TextCheck is true, every command which expects XML Chars, a
              comment, a CDATA section value or a processing instructing value
              will check, if the given string is valid according to its
              production rule. For commands created with the createNodeCmd
              method to be used in the context of appendFromScript the status
              of the flag at creation time decides. If TextCheck is true at
              creation time, the command will check its arguments, otherwise
              not.The setTextCheck method sets this flag. It returns the
              current TextCheck flag state. The default state for TextCheck is
              true.

       dom setObjectCommands ?(automatic|token|command)?
              Controls if documents and nodes are created as Tcl commands or
              as token to be used with the domNode and domDoc commands. If the
              mode is 'automatic', then methods used at Tcl commands will
              create Tcl commands and methods used at doc or node tokes will
              create tokens. If the mode is 'command' then always Tcl commands
              will be created. If the mode is 'token', then always token will
              be created. The method returns the current mode. This method is
              an experimental interface.

              according to production 2 of the XML 1.0 recommendation.
              Otherwise it returns 0.

       dom isHTML5CustomName string
              Returns 1 if string is a HTML5 valid custom element name
              (according to https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#valid-custom-
              element-name at 26 June 2024, it's a living standard). Otherwise
              it returns 0.

       dom clearString ?-replace? string
              Returns the string given as argument cleared out from any
              characters not allowed as XML parsed character data. If the
              -replace option is given then instead of removing such
              characters are replaced with \uFFFD.

       dom isBMPCharData string
              Returns 1 if every character in string is a valid XML Char with
              a Unicode code point within the Basic Multilingual Plane (that
              means, that every character within the string is at most 3 bytes
              long). Otherwise it returns 0.

       dom isComment string
              Returns 1 if string is a valid comment according to production

       dom featureinfo feature
              This method provides information about the used build options
              and the expat version. The valid values for the feature argument
              are:

              expatversion
                     Returns the version of the underlyling expat version as
                     string, something like "exapt_2.1.0". This is what the
                     expat API function XML_ExpatVersion() returns.

              expatmajorversion
                     Returns the major version of the at build time used expat
                     version as integer.
