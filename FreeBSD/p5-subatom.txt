NAME
       subatom - produce an atom feed from subversion commits

SYNOPSIS
         subatom [-m max] [-o output] [-v viewcvs] REPOSITORY_URL [path ...]
         subatom -c config_file

DESCRIPTION
       subatom is a small script to produce an Atom feed from subversion
       commits.  You can use this with a feed reader to see new commits to
       your repository.

       The first argument is the URL for your subversion repository.  The
       remaining arguments are paths within the repository for which you would
       like commit messages.  If you don't specify any, it will default to the
       entire repository.

       The -m flag states how many entries you would like in the feed.  The
       default is 30.

       If you pass a filename using the -o flag, the output will be written
       there instead of STDOUT.  If the filename already exists then the
       timestamp will be checked and the new feed will only be written if it
       actually contains any newer entries.  If you will be serving the feed
       file using a web server, then doing this enables If-Modified-Since to
       work correctly (ie: feed readers will only download the file if it has
       actually changed).

       You can pass an URL using the -v flag, and subatom will create a link
       for each commit by appending the revision number to the URL.  For
       example a viewcvs URL might look like this (on the command line).

           http://example.com/viewcvs/svn/?view=rev&rev=

       If the URL has question marks or ampersands, don't forget to quote it
       on the command line.  If you don't, the shell will interpret them and
       probably give some odd looking errors.

       If you don't pass in a URL, a link will be automatically made to the
       first file that changed in this commit.

       If you pass an URL using the -s flag, it will be used as the self link
       for the feed.  Use this if you would like to avoid warnings from the
       feed validator.

CONFIG FILE
       In order to avoid wrapper scripts calling subatom with lots of
       parameters, you can also specify a config file.  The format of the file
       consists of lines containing key-value pairs separated by whitespace.
       A blank line introduces a new stanza.  You can generate multiple feeds
       by specifying several stanzas.

       The following keywords are recognized.

       max_entries
           How many entries should be in the feed?  Defaults to 30.

       output_file
           Where should the feed be written to?  Must be specified.

       repos_url
           The path to the root of the repository.  Must be specified.

           NB: subatom likes to have the trailing slash removed, if you get
           any complaints, try taking it off.

       path
           Specifies a directory in the repository to monitor commit messages
           for.  Defaults to '/'.

       self_url
           Specifies the URL of the feed that will be produced.  No default.

       viewcvs_url
           Specifies an URL prefix which will have the revision number
           appended to produce the link for each commit.  For example, if you
           have a trac setup, use something like this:

             viewcvs_url http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/

       feed_title
           Specify the title for the feed as a whole. Defaults to "Recent
           commits to $repos_url".

   EXAMPLE
           output_file /www/svn.atom
           path        /trunk
           repos_url   http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn
           self_url    http://localhost/svn.atom
           viewcvs_url http://svn.collab.net/viewvc/svn?view=rev&revision=
           feed_title  Subversion Changes

           output_file /www/rails.atom
           path        /trunk
           repos_url   http://dev.rubyonrails.org/svn/rails
           self_url    http://localhost/rails.atom
           viewcvs_url http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/
