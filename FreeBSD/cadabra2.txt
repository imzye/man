NAME
       cadabra-server - the server backend for running Cadabra2 notebooks

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
       On starting cadabra-server, it will print a port number on stdout,
       where connections to the cadabra kernel can be made. All interaction
       with the server is through that port on the localhost interface.
