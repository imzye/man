DESCRIPTION
       todo is a program aimed specifically at programmers (but usable by
       anybody at the terminal) to aid in day-to-day development.

       It maintains a list of items that have yet to be completed. This allows
       the programmer to track outstanding bugs or items that need to be
       completed with very little effort.

       Items can be prioritised and can also be displayed in a hierarchy, so
       that one item may depend on another.

       With the use of some small shell scripts (scripts.* in the doc
       directory of the source distribution), todo can also display the
       outstanding items in a directory as you change into it. So, for
       example, if you cd into the source directory for todo itself you should
       see a list of outstanding items...unless all of the bugs have been
       fixed ;).

OPTIONS
       Options can have both a long and a short form.

       Short options can be combined into one argument by using a hyphen
       followed by a string of short options. Parameters of short options can
       also be appended to this string.

       -v, --verbose
              Display verbosely

       -a, --add [<text>]
              Add a note (will prompt for a note if one is not supplied).

       -g, --graft <index>
              In conjunction with --add or --link, graft the new item to the
              specified item.

       -l, --link <database>
              Link the specified todo file into the body of this one. If the
              linked database has a title set, this will be used as the body
              of the linking item otherwise the directory name of the linked
              database will be used. Use --remove (or tdr) to remove linked
              databases - this does not remove the database itself, only the
              link.

       -R,--reparent <index>[,<index>]
              Change the parent of the first item index to the second item
              index. If no second index is given the item is reparented to the
              root of the tree.

       -p, --priority <priority>
              In conjunction with --add or --edit, set the priority (default |
              veryhigh | high | medium | low | verylow)

       -e, --edit <index>
              Edit the note that is indexed by the given number.

       --remove <indices>
              Remove the note indexed by the given numbers, including any
              children.

       -d, --done <indices>
              Mark the specified notes (and their children) as done.

       -D, --not-done <indices>
              Mark the specified notes (and all children) as not done.

       --global-database <file>
              Specify the database to use if either the -G or --global options
              are specified.

       -G, --global
              Force todo to use the database specified with --global-database.
              If this is placed in your ~/.todorc it will force todo to use
              that database to the exclusion of all others.

       --database <file>
              Change the database from whatever the default is (typically
              '.todo') to the file specified.

       -T, --TODO
              Generate a typical TODO output text file from a Todo DB.

       -A, --all
              Shortcut for the filter '+done,+children' to show all notes.

       -f, --filter <filter>
              Display only those notes that pass the filter. Please refer the
              section FILTERS for more information.

       --colour <colours>
              Override default colours of todo items. Please refer to the
              section COLOUR for more information.

       --force-colour
              Force use of colour even when not outputting to a TTY. This is
              useful when piping to less(1) -R.

       --mono Remove all ANSI escape sequences from output - useful for colour
              impaired terminals.

       --help Display this help.

       --version
              Display version of ToDo.

       --title [<text>]
              Set the title of this directory's todo notes.

       --date-format <format>
              Format the display of time values. The format is that used by
              strftime(3). The default format is '%c'. This option is best
              specified in the ~/.todorc.

       --format <identifier>=<format>
              Specify the formatting of output. Please refer to the section
              FORMATTING for more information.

       --use-format <builtin>=<identifier>
              Use the format string identified by <identifier> (defined with
              --format) as the format string to use when formatting with the
              builtin format <builtin>.

       --sort <expression>
              Sort the database with the specified expression. Refer to the
              section SORTING for more detailed information.

       --paranoid
              Be paranoid about some settings, including permissions.

       --database-loaders <loader list>
              Try the database formats in the given order. Valid formats are
              xml and binary. eg. todo --database-loaders binary,xml. The
              default format is XML.

       --backup [<n>]
              Backup the database up to <n> times, just before it is written
              to. If <n> is not specified, one backup will be made. The
              filenames used to store the backups are the default database
              name with their revision appended like so: .todo.1, .todo.2,
              etc. To actually use one of these backups, you can either mv it
              to .todo or use --database .todo.<n> to explicitly specify its
              use.

       -s, --summary
              Toggle "summary" mode, where long items are truncated to one
              line.

       -c, --comment
              Edit or show comments respectively.

       --timeout [<time>]
              If <time> is specified, the timeout between database displays is
              set to this number of seconds. If no <time> is specified, the
              behaviour is to display the database only if it has not been
              displayed for the number of seconds specified by --timeout with
              the <time> given. eg. todo --timeout 10 --timeout would only
              display the database at most once every 10 seconds. Putting a
              timeout 10 in your ~/.todorc is a good option, then the
              --timeout in the doc/scripts.* will mean that the database won't
              be displayed every time you cd into a directory.

       --purge [<days-old>]
              Purge all completed items older than <days-old>. If <days-old>
              is omitted, all completed records are purged.

PRIORITIES
       Priorities can be specified symbolically using the words default,
       veryhigh, high, medium, low and verylow.

       The default priority has special meaning in that it will use the
       default priority for any action. This means that when editing an
       existing item, its priority is preserved; when creating a new item, the
       priority will be set to medium; when grafting a new item, its priority
       will be that of its parent. DevTodo will not prompt for priority if
       this is specified, making it a handy feature for your todorc. As with
       all options, the priority can be overridden on the command line.

FILTERS
       Filters are comprised of a list of expressions used to define the notes
       that are displayed.

       The general format of a filter expression is:

       ([-|=|+](all|children|done|<index>|<priority>)) | (/<search
       expression>)

       Generally, if a filter expression is prefixed with a '-' it will not
       display items that match the expression, if prefixed with a '+' it will
       display items that match this expression in addition to others, or if
       prefixed with a '=' (or no prefix at all) it will display only those
       items that match the expression. Note that this will only search items
       not excluded by other filters, so to search the entire database you
       will have to do something like: todo --filter all,/some-search-string.

       The second form of filter expression is used for searching for text in
       a database. <search expression> is a regular expression which is
       matched against the text body of each item.

       Filter atoms are filtered in order by done state, priority, then
       search. So first items that do not match the "done" filter will be
       excluded, then those that do not match the priority filter, and so on.

       The expressions in detail:

       all    Forces all items to be displayed. The various prefixes have no
              effect on this expression.

       children
              Collapse or expand child items. If the '-' prefix is present
              children are collapsed, otherwise children are displayed.

       done   Filter on whether an item is completed or not.

       <index>
              Note indices are specified as numbers. Ranges can be given ala
              '1.2.10-20'.

       <priority>
              Priorities are specified as described in the PRIORITIES section.
              A prefix of '-' will display all items with priorities less than
              or equal to the given priority. With a '+' prefix, all items
              with priorities greater than or equal to the given priority are
              shown. If '=' or no prefix is given, only items with the
              specified priority are displayed.

       Examples:

       todo --filter done,-children,+low

       This will display only those items that are done and have a priority of
       low or higher. In addition, children will be collapsed.

       todo /[Tt]he

       Display only those items with the word 'the' in them, where the first
       letter can be lower or upper case. It may be necessary to quote the
       search expression to ensure the shell does not interpret them.

FORMATTING
       The output of todo can be changed to be more to your liking by defining
       your own formatting strings. These strings are similar to those used in
       printf(3) and strftime(3).

       The following examples, which can be placed in ~/.todorc, will mimic
       the default behaviour:

       # Display in default format
       format display=%i%[info]%f%2n.%[priority]%T

       # Display in default format
       format generated=%2i-%T%2i  (added %d, priority %p)\n\n

       There are four seperate format options: display, generated,
       verbose-display and verbose-generated. The latter two are used to
       format their respective text when --verbose is specified as an argument
       to todo.

       In addition, users can create their own format strings by simply
       passing a different identifier to format. This can then be enabled by
       using --use-format. eg.

       format full-report=%i%[info]%f%2n.%[priority]%+1T%+1i%[info]Added:
       %[normal]%c  %[info]Completed: %[normal]%d\n%+1i%[info]Duration:
       %[normal]%D  %[info]Priority: %[normal]%p\n\n
       # Override the display format to use "full-report".
       use-format display=full-report

       The various flags that are available are:

       %<n>>  The > flag sets the number of spaces <n> to use for all future
              indenting.

       %[+|-][<n>]i
              Indent to depth of current item. <n> specifies the depth to
              indent to. If <n> is ommitted, the current level is used.
              Relative values can be used. eg. '%+1T' would indent to one
              level higher than the current indentation level.

       %[+|-][<n>]T
              Display the text of the item, wrapped at 80 characters and
              indented to the specified level. Semantics of <n> are as with
              %i. Note that wrapped text automatically adds a '0 at the end of
              the text, whereas %t will not.

       %t     Unwrapped, unformatted text of the item.

       %s     Summary text (ie. one line only, equivalent to --summary).

       %p     The priority level of the current item.

       %c     The current items creation date, formatted according to --date-
              format.

       %d     The date when the item was marked as done, formatted according
              to --date-format.

       %D     The duration of the item, formatted according to --date-format.

       %[<n>]n
              The index number of the current item. The optional numeric value
              <n> specifies the number of characters the number should occupy.
              The number is padded out with spaces so as to fill this number
              of characters.

       %f     The state flag of the current item. The displayed values for
              this flag are '+' means children, '-' means done', '*' means
              done with children.

       %F     The human readable state flag of the current item. The displayed
              values for this flag are 'children', 'done' means done', 'done,
              children' and 'open'.

       %[<colour>]
              Colours can be specified with this flag. The valid values for
              <colour> are: verylow, low, medium, high, veryhigh, title, info,
              and priority. These are fairly self explanatory, except priority
              changes to the current items priority colour. eg. %[priority]

       Please note that when indenting, you will typically want to use a
       prefix value of '+1' with %T. ie. %+1T. This forces the text to indent
       to one level deeper than the current level, making it sit away from any
       other formatting you may have used.

SORTING
       The display of items in the database can be sorted on a variety of
       keys. Given a series of keys todo sorts on each successive key,
       continuing to the next only if the previous key comparison was equal.
       For example:

       todo --sort -done,text

       This will sort firstly by whether an item is completed and secondly by
       their text. This effectively groups items into two blocks - those that
       are complete and those that aren't.

       The keys that are available are created, completed, text, priority,
       duration, none and done. Each key, except none can be prefixed with a -
       to reverse its default order and multiple keys must be seperated with a
       ,.

       If multiple --sort parameters are encountered the last one is used.
       This means that a 'sort' entry in ~/.todorc will be overridden by any
       on the command line.

INDICES
       Indicies are used as options to a variety of command line arguments.
       Multiple note indices are seperated with commas (spaces are not
       allowed). Children are scoped using a '.'.

       For example, given the following notes:

       1. Do man pages
          1. Make them more beautiful.
          2. Make HTML documentation as well.

       The second sub-item would be represented like this: 1.2

       The wildcard '*' can be used to represent all children of a node. eg.
       1.*

       Ranges of notes can be specified by using '<a>-<b>'. For example, to
       mark notes 10.1.2, 10.1.3 and 10.3.4 as done, you could do: todo --done
       10.1.2-4

COLOUR
       Various items can be colourised. Items that can are veryhigh, high,
       medium, low, verylow, title and info. info is used for displaying item
       numbers and general information.

       These items can be set to one of eight colours. Those colours are
       black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white and default. The
       colour default is used to specify the default foreground terminal
       colour.

       Colours are specified like so:

       <item>=[+]<colour>

       If the optional + in this expression is used it will cause the item to
       become bold.

       For example, a line in your ~/.todorc might look like:

       colour    medium=+white

       Which would make medium text bold white.

TODORC
       todo can load options from a number of resource files. The order in
       which these are parsed is as follows:

       1. The file specified in the environment variable TODORC or, if that
       does not exist, /usr/local/etc/todorc.
       2. ~/.todorc

       Options are cumulative in that those loaded from $TODORC will be
       overridden or added to by those in ~/.todorc.

       These options are specified as key/value pairs, one per line The key is
       the long name of a command line argument and the value is the parameter
       to that argument,if any. In addition, environment variables are
       expanded.

       For example, the --filter command line argument accepts a parameter
       that is a filter expression. A default filter could be added to the
       ~/.todorc file like so:

       # Don't display child items by default
       filter -children

       The only difference between options specified in the rc file and those
       on the command line is that options in the rc file are not prefixed by
       --.

       In addition, there are two commands available in the RC file that are
       not available on the command line. They are:

       The first command, on, is used to conditionally add specific commands.
       The format of this command is: on <event> <command> [<arguments>].
       Valid events are add, remove, view, edit, generate, done, notdone,
       title, reparent, load, save, link, create and purge. Multiple commands
       can be passed to on by enclosing them in braces (whitespace is required
       between tokens). Full example below.

       The second command is exec <shell command>. This command will execute
       the argument it is given in a shell. The environment variable $TODODB
       contains the filename of the current database. eg. exec chmod 600
       $TODODB

       There is an example rc file in the doc subdirectory of the source
       distribution.

EXAMPLES
       To display any outstanding items in the current directory, simply type:

            todo

       To remove notes 1, 2 and 4:

            todo --remove 1,2,4

       To display ALL items:

            todo all

       To display only the top-level items and not their children:

            todo -children

       (even though -children is not a valid argument, this works because todo
       interprets any command line arguments it doesn't recognise as being
       part of a filter expression)

       A more complex example. This adds a new item, with the text of the item
       specified on the command line, with a priority of high as a child of
       the third child of the second item (if that makes any sense):

            todo -a "Fix the man page" -p high -g 2.3

       This is an example of how to use the TODO feature of todo. It makes
       todo generate a new TODO file from the information stored in the
       database. This particular example outputs all items to the TODO file,
       even those marked as done.

            todo --filter all --TODO

       This example shows a nice use of the event triggers. When a new
       database is created it will force its permissions to 0600.

            on create {
                 verbose
                 exec chmod 600 .todo
            }
