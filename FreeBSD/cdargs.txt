CDARGS(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              CDARGS(1)

NAME
       cdargs - bookmarks and browser for cd shell built-in

SYNOPSIS
       cdargs [OPTIONS]
       function cv () {
           cdargs "$1" && cd "`cat "$HOME/.cdargsresult"`" ;
       }
       cv [Needle]

DESCRIPTION
       With cdargs you can jump to various places throughout the file-system
       that are defined using a plain text, line oriented bookmarks file.

       You can create bookmarks by editing your bookmarks file "$HOME/.cdargs"
       using your favorite editor, by using the "--add" option to cdargs or by
       using the built-in mechanism that will be described later.

       While you are in cdargs you can use various commands to navigate
       through your list of bookmarks and through the file-system. These are
       described below in the section "COMMANDS". The most commonly used and
       most obvious commands are the up/down keys for navigation, "ENTER" for
       selection of a path and "q" for quit.

       To be able to actually use this program together with the shell built-
       in "cd" command you must use a little trick by defining a shell
       function. Of course the syntax for this is different between the
       csh-like shells (like tcsh) and the sh-like shells (like bash).

       For sh-like shells:
       function cv () {
           cdargs "$1" && cd "`cat "$HOME/.cdargsresult"`" ;
       }

       For csh-like shells:
       alias cv 'cdargs \!* && cd `cat $HOME/.cdargsresult`'

       Now you only have to put the cdargs binary somewhere into your path.

       Of course you can create functions and/or aliases for different
       purposes. You might want to add a pwd call to echo your current
       directories or put --nowrap in your functions to enable a different
       scrolling behavior. See section SHELL FUNCTIONS below.

       Since version 1.19 cdargs brings a collection of bash functions (and
       since 1.20 tcsh aliases, too) with it. You only have to source this in
       your ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc (or ~/.tcsh) and you get nice kinds of
       magic prepared (completion...). Please read the cdargs-bash.sh or
       cdargs-tcsh.csh respectively for the documentation of these functions.


COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
       You can call cdargs with a few options, but otherwise you probably
       won't call it directly but via the function you defined.

       -h or --help
              display usage information and exit.

       -v or --version
              output version information and exit.

       -a or --add=[:desc:]path
              add path to the bookmarks list using the optional desc as
              description string.

       -f or --file=FILE
              uses the given FILE as bookmarks file

       -u or --user=USER
              read the default bookmarks file of USER. Won't modify that file.

       -o or --output=FILE
              use FILE as the result-file (who knows what The World might make
              of this feature that I can't imagine...)

       -b or --browse
              start cdargs in BROWSE mode in the current directory.

       -r or --noresolve
              Don't exit with a result when the Needle matches a description
              exactly (which is some every-day-magic) but show a list (even if
              it contains just one entry).

       -c or --cwd
              Make the current working directory the current entry on startup
              if it appears on the list.

       --nowrap
              Don't wrap the cursor around when hitting the end of the list.

       Needle The Needle performs some magic which I hope improves the usage
              of cdargs.

              The Needle is examined in the following order and the first
              thing that fits is taken.

              If Needle is a one-digit integer the appropriate entry is
              preselected.

              Otherwise if Needle is a string each entry of the list is
              checked whether it contains Needle.

              Then Needle has two functions:
              If it just matches a substring of either path or description
              that option is placed in the list.

              If it exactly matches a description string this is the result
              (that means cdargs closes the curses window, exits and the
              changing of directories takes place).

              If it doesn't match a line, that line won't be displayed.

              And to make things even more complicated you can affect this
              behavior by using the "--noresolve" option. This option is used
              when you think you give a Needle which matches descriptions
              exactly but you don't want it to be resolved if it does. This
              option is internally turned on when you delete an entry
              (otherwise the deletion of entries until only one entry is left
              would lead to resolving) or when the bookmarks file contains
              only one entry.

              Finally, if the filtered list (but not the bookmarks file)
              contains only one entry it is selected and the program exits
              successfully, unless you chose --noresolve.

              I can only hope that you understand this nested if babble...

              Please note, that the existence of a Needle disables the saving
              of the list at the end of the program.


COMMANDS
       When you are in cdargs you have two modes and several commands at your
       hands.

       The two modes are LIST (when your bookmark list is displayed) and
       BROWSE (when you navigate through the file-system).

       The navigation keys are mostly available in Emacs and vi style for all
       maniacs out there.

       Common Keys

       <UP>/<DOWN> or k/j or C-n/C-p
              move selection up/down and scroll.

       <ENTER>
              select current entry.

       <TAB>  toggle modes: LIST or BROWSE.

       <HOME>/<END> or C-a/C-e
              goto first/last entry in list.

       c      add current directory to list.

       C      add current directory to list but ask the user for a description

       <PgUp>/<PgDown> or C-v
              Scroll the list in 10-line-steps.  This will never wraparound
              and does not honor the nowrap-option

       e, v   edit the list in $EDITOR.

       H, ?   show the help-screen.

       ~, /   browse home/root directory.

       q      quit - saving the list.

       C-c, C-g, C-[
              abort - don't save the list.

       Keys in BROWSE mode

       <LEFT>, h, C-b
              descent into current directory.

       <RIGHT>, l, C-f
              up one directory.

       [num]  make [num] the current highlighted entry

       a      add current entry to list.

       A      add current entry to list but ask the user for a description,
              just like with 'c' and 'C'.

       .      toggle display of hidden files.

       Keys in LIST mode

       [num]  select and resolve entry [num] if displayed.

       <LEFT>, h, C-b
              descent into the current entry.

       <RIGHT>, l, C-f
              up one directory from current dir.

       d or C-d
              delete current entry from list.

       s or t swap (transpose) two entries of the list.

       M or m move an entry up or down in the list and set the current
              position afterwards so that repeated keystrokes keep moving the
              same entry up and down.



SHELL FUNCTIONS
       In addition to the shell function mentioned above you might wish to add
       other commands to your function. One example is to echo the directory
       you changed to:

       function cv () {
           cdargs "$1" && cd "`cat "$HOME/.cdargsresult"`"
                       && pwd;
       }

       Or you can remove the file in which cdargs reports it's result:

       function cv () {
           cdargs "$1" && cd "`cat "$HOME/.cdargsresult"`"
                       && rm -f "$HOME/.cdargsresult";
       }

       Since version 1.19 cdargs comes with a file of preset functions for
       bash: see cdargs-bash.sh in the distribution. From now on you only have
       to source that file if you are using a sh-like shell.  Then you can use
       the shell completion to switch directories even faster by typing

       cv [TAB]

       Since version 1.20 cdargs comes with a file of rudimentary aliases (and
       completion) for the tcsh.
       Any volunteers for porting all the bash functionality to tcsh are
       welcome.


DISPLAY
       The cdargs window has one line at the bottom for the display of
       messages like when you added to your list or when you hit an unknown
       key.

       The second line from the bottom is a status line which shows the
       current directory and a one letter code for the current operation mode:

       B      for BROWSE

       L      for LIST

       The largest part of the display is used to show you either the list of
       your bookmarks or the contents of the current directory. On the left
       side you'll probably find a number which you can use for a slightly
       quicker jumping compared to using the cursor movement. These numbers
       can be moved as described above. Next comes the short description of an
       entry in brackets. This is convient when you have quite long paths in
       your bookmarks and most of them start with the same base (e.g.
       /home/user). Finally there is the actual absolute path you'll be
       warping to when finishing. Obviously the current entry is highlighted.

       If the path is preced by a "!" it points to an invalid directory. A
       bookmark pointing to the current working directory is displayed in bold
       font (if the terminal emulation understands that attribute).



FILES
       $HOME/.cdargs personal bookmarks file.

       $HOME/.cdargsresult
