NAME
       Gtk2 - Perl interface to the 2.x series of the Gimp Toolkit library

SYNOPSIS
         use Gtk2 -init;
         # Gtk2->init; works if you didn't use -init on use
         my $window = Gtk2::Window->new ('toplevel');
         my $button = Gtk2::Button->new ('Quit');
         $button->signal_connect (clicked => sub { Gtk2->main_quit });
         $window->add ($button);
         $window->show_all;
         Gtk2->main;

ABSTRACT
       Perl bindings to the 2.x series of the Gtk+ widget set.  This module
       allows you to write graphical user interfaces in a Perlish and object-
       oriented way, freeing you from the casting and memory management in C,
       yet remaining very close in spirit to original API.

DESCRIPTION
       The Gtk2 module allows a Perl developer to use the Gtk+ graphical user
       interface library.  Find out more about Gtk+ at http://www.gtk.org.

       The GTK+ Reference Manual is also a handy companion when writing Gtk
       programs in any language.  http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/gtk/
       The Perl bindings follow the C API very closely, and the C reference
       documentation should be considered the canonical source.

       To discuss gtk2-perl, ask questions and flame/praise the authors, join
       gtk-perl-list@gnome.org at lists.gnome.org.

       Also have a look at the gtk2-perl website and sourceforge project page,
       http://gtk2-perl.sourceforge.net

INITIALIZATION
         use Gtk2 qw/-init/;
         use Gtk2 qw/-init -threads-init/;

       -init
           Equivalent to Gtk2->init, called to initialize GLIB and GTK+. Just
           about every Gtk2-Perl script should do "use Gtk2 -init"; This
           initialization should take place before using any other Gtk2
           functions in your GUI applications. It will initialize everything
           needed to operate the toolkit and parses some standard command line
           options. @ARGV is adjusted accordingly so your own code will never
           see those standard arguments.

       -threads-init
           Equivalent to Gtk2::Gdk::Threads->init, called to initialze/enable
           gdk's thread safety mechanisms so that gdk can be accessed from
           multiple threads when used in conjunction with
           Gtk2::Gdk::Threads->enter and Gtk2::Gdk::Threads->leave. If invoked
           as Gtk2::Gdk::Threads->init it should be done before Gtk2->init is
           called, if done by "use Gtk2 -init -threads-init" order does not
           matter.

EXPORTS
       Gtk2 exports nothing by default, but some constants are available upon
       request.

       Tag: constants
             GTK_PRIORITY_RESIZE

             GTK_PATH_PRIO_LOWEST
             GTK_PATH_PRIO_GTK
             GTK_PATH_PRIO_APPLICATION
             GTK_PATH_PRIO_THEME
             GTK_PATH_PRIO_RC
             GTK_PATH_PRIO_HIGHEST

             GDK_PRIORITY_EVENTS
             GDK_PRIORITY_REDRAW
             GDK_CURRENT_TIME

       See Glib for other standard priority levels.

SEE ALSO
       perl(1), Glib(3pm), Pango(3pm).

       Gtk2::Gdk::Keysyms(3pm) contains a hash of key codes, culled from
       gdk/gdkkeysyms.h

       Gtk2::api(3pm) describes how to map the C API into Perl, and some of
       the important differences in the Perl bindings.

       Gtk2::Helper(3pm) contains stuff that makes writing Gtk2 programs a
       little easier.

       Gtk2::SimpleList(3pm) makes the GtkListStore and GtkTreeModel a lot
       easier to use.

       Gtk2::Pango(3pm) exports various little-used but important constants
       you may need to work with pango directly.

       Gtk2::index(3pm) lists the autogenerated api documentation pod files
       for Gtk2.

       Gtk2 also provides code to make it relatively painless to create Perl
       wrappers for other GLib/Gtk-based libraries.  See Gtk2::CodeGen,
       ExtUtils::PkgConfig, and ExtUtils::Depends.  If you're writing
       bindings, you'll probably also be interested in Gtk2::devel, which is a
       supplement to Glib::devel and Glib::xsapi.  The Binding Howto, at
       http://gtk2-perl.sourceforge.net/doc/binding_howto.pod.html, ties it
       all together.
