NAME
       semantik - a mindmapping-like tool

SYNOPSIS
       semantik [Qt-options][KDE-options][url]

DESCRIPTION
       Semantik (previously Kdissert) is a mindmapping-like tool to help
       students to produce complicated documents very quickly and efficiently
       : presentations, dissertations, thesis, reports.

       While targetted mostly at students, Semantik can also help teachers,
       decision maker, engineers and businessmen.

       Though this application shares some similarities with general-purpose
       mindmapping tools like Freemind or Vym, the very first goal of Semantik
       is to create general-purpose documents through the use of mindmaps.
