DEVICE_QUIET(9)        FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual       DEVICE_QUIET(9)

NAME
     device_quiet, device_verbose, device_is_quiet – manipulate device quiet
     flag

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <sys/bus.h>

     void
     device_quiet(device_t dev);

     void
     device_verbose(device_t dev);

     int
     device_is_quiet(device_t dev);

DESCRIPTION
     Each device has a quiet flag associated with it.  A device is verbose by
     default when it is created but may be quieted to prevent printing of the
     device identification string during attach and printing of a message
     during detach.  To quiet a device, call device_quiet() during a device
     driver probe routine.  To re-enable probe messages, call
     device_verbose().  To test to see if a device is quieted, call
     device_is_quiet().

     Devices are implicitly marked verbose after a driver detaches.
