Template::Plugin::Class(3)                 User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Template::Plugin::Class - allow calling of class methods on arbitrary
       classes

SYNOPSIS
         [% USE foo = Class('Foo') %]
         [% foo.bar %]

DESCRIPTION
       Template::Plugin::Class allows you to call class methods on arbitrary
       classes.  One use for this is in Class::DBI style applications, where
       you may do somthing like this:

         [% USE cd = Class('Music::CD') %]
         [% FOREACH disc = cd.retrieve_all %]
         [% disc.artist %] - [% disc.title %]
         [% END %]

CAVEATS
       You won't be able to directly call "AUTOLOAD" or "DESTROY" methods on
       the remote class.  This shouldn't be a huge hardship.

BUGS
       Apart from the mentioned caveat, none currently known.  If you find any
       please contact the author.
