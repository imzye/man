NAME
       Net::LDAP::Config - a simple wrapper for maintaining info related to
       LDAP connections

SYNOPSIS
               my $config = Net::LDAP::Config->new('source' => 'default');
               $config->clauth(); # CLI authentation
               $config->bind(
                       'dn' => $dn,
                       'password' => $password
               ); # normal authentation

DESCRIPTION
       Net::LDAP::Config is a wrapper module originally written for ldapsh but
       which is useful for much more.  It's not very well documented just yet,
       but here are the main uses:

CONFIG FILE
       The config file is a simple INI-style format.  There is one special
       section, main, and the only option it recognizes is default, for
       specifying the default source.  Any other sections specify an LDAP
       source.

       For example:   [ldap]    servers: ldap1.domain.com,ldap2.domain.com
            base: dc=domain,dc=com   ssl: require

               [main]
               default: ldap

       A main config file is looked for in /etc/ldapsh_config and
       /usr/local/etc/ldapsh_config, and then in the user's home directory,
       either in the file specified by $LDAP_CONFIG or ~/.ldapsh_config.

CLI AUTHENTICATION
       If you are building an interactive script, you'll want to use this
       method:

       create the configuration object, which basically pulls the server
       configuration from the config file
        my $config = Net::LDAP::Config->new('source' => 'mysource');

       and then get all of the necessary info this caches ldap UIDs in
       ~/.ldapuids

        $config->clauth();

NORMAL AUTHENTICATION
       This is where you collect the DN and password and auth normally:

        my $config = Net::LDAP::Config->new('source' => 'mysource');
        $config->bind(
               'dn' => $dn,
               'password' => $password
        ); # normal authentation

       If you don't want to authenticate, use connect:

        my $config = Net::LDAP::Config->new('source' => 'mysource');
        $config->connect();

       Yes, it sucks that there's a difference.  I'm still trying to clean up
       the API.

       You should probably just use bind, as it behaves well either with or
       without auth information.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       Here are the environment variables that Net::LDAP::Config uses:

       LDAP_UIDFILE
           The file in which to store LDAP DN's.  Defaults to ~/.ldapuids.
           This file is maintained automatically by Net::LDAP::Config,
           although you can modify it if you like -- it just caches the
           searched-for DN so you don't have to specify your username each
           time.

           Feel free to recommend a different design.

       LDAP_CONFIG
           A user-specific config file; over-rides any information in the
           central file.  Defaults to ~/.ldapsh_config.

FUNCTIONS
       debug
           Can be used to turn debugging on (debug("on")) or off
           (debug("off")), otherwise prints on STDERR anything passed to it if
           debugging is currently on.

       error
           Used to store and report errors on the shell.  Any arguments passed
           to error are joined into a single error message and returned as an
           error any time error is called.

           EXAMPLE

               if ( error() ) { warn error("There was a problem"); } else {
               dostuff(); }

               if (error()) { die error(); }

       multiConnect
           Connects to the first viable ldap server from a list or reference
           to a list.
