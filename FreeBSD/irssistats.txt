NAME
       irssistats — A tool to generate HTML IRC stats based on irssi logs.

SYNOPSIS
       irssistats [/path/to/file.conf]

DESCRIPTION
       irssistats is a tool that make HTML stats from irssi logfiles.

       The statistics generated display many useful and funny informations
       about the channel.

USING IT
       First you need to copy the files needed for the HTML page :

       cp /usr/share/irssistats/data/* /path/to/webdir/

       Then you must edit a configuration file : "/etc/irssistats.conf",
       "~/.irssistats", or another file given as a parameter.

       Now you can generate the statistics for your channel :

       irssistats [/path/to/file.conf]

       The logfiles for irssi are usually located in
       "~/irclogs/network/channel.log"

CONFIGURATION FILE
       Please look at the sample configuration file in
       "/usr/share/docs/irssistats/sample.configfile" for an example.

       The path to the configuration file can be given on the command line :
       irssistats /path/to/irssistats.conf

       If no configuration file is given, irssistats looks for files
       ~/.irssistats.conf or then /etc/irssistats.conf

       Lines starting by ; # -- or // are ignored (comments).

       This file is read sequencially, so it acts like a script.

       Each option keyword is case sensitive, and you must put separators
       around the ':' character.

       Blank lines must not contain any spaces !

       Each option keeps its value until erased by another value.

       IMPORTANT : the order of options to parse a channel must allways be
       "input" THEN "nickfile" THEN "photofile" THEN "output".

       Available options are :

       debug     Allows you to display debugging informations.

       output    This allow you to generate the HTML file.


                 Note that irssistats will really generate the HTML file as
                 soon as it reads this option.

NICKFILE
       Since version 0.4 of irssistats, you can use a nickfile to specify
       nicks to join.

       Each line of the nickfile contains the final nick and a regular
       expression.

       Examples :

       royale ^[Rr]oyale
                 join nicks starting with "Royale" or "royale" to the final
                 nick "royale"

       royale ^antoine$
                 also join the nick "antoine" to the final nick "royale"

       djakette [Dd]ja
                 join any nick that contains "Dja" or "dja" to final nick
                 "djakette"

       <NULL> ^botroyale$
                 remove "bot|royale" from statistics

       The nickfile must not contain any comments.

       The <NULL> final nick will remove matching nicks from all statistics,
       except from "Some URLs" and "Some topics"...

       You can also take a look at the "sample.nickfile" in this package (in
       "/usr/share/doc/irssistats/").

PHOTOFILE
       Since version 0.70 of irssistats, you can use a photofile to display
       pictures for users.

       Each line of the photofile contains the final nick and an URL for the
       image.

       Examples :

       royale http://royale.zerezo.com/chat/faces/happy40.png
                 (a full address)

       sektor ../chat/faces/happy40.png
                 (a relative address)

       The photofile must not contain any comments.

       You can also take a look at the "sample.photofile" in this package (in
       "/usr/share/doc/irssistats/").
