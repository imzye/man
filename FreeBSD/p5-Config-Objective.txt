Config::Objective::List(3)                 User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Config::Objective::List - list data type class for Config::Objective

SYNOPSIS
         use Config::Objective;
         use Config::Objective::List;

         my $conf = Config::Objective->new('filename', {
                               'listobj'       => Config::Objective::List->new()
                       });

DESCRIPTION
       The Config::Objective::List module provides a class that represents a
       list in an object so that it can be used with Config::Objective.  Its
       methods can be used to manipulate the encapsulated list from the config
       file.

       The Config::Objective::List class is derived from the
       Config::Objective::DataType class, but it defines/overrides the
       following methods:

       add()
           Adds the supplied value to the end of the object's list.  The value
           can be a scalar or a reference to a list, in which case the values
           in the referenced list are added to the object's list.

       unset()
           Sets the object's value to an empty list.

       set()
           The same as add(), except that the existing list is emptied by
           calling the unset() method before adding the new data.

       default()
           Calls the add() method.

       add_top()
           Same as add, but adds to the front of the list instead of the end.

       delete()
           Deletes elements from the list that match its argument.  Matching
           is performed by using the argument as a regular expression.  The
           argument can be a scalar or a reference to a list, in which case
           each item of the referenced list is used to check the values in the
           object's list.
