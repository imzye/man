DESCRIPTION
     When executed without a command argument sockin accepts text on stdin and
     writes it to socket which must be a UNIX domain socket.

     In the second form, command specifies a command to execute for which it's
     input and output will be redirected to socket

OPTIONS
     sockin accepts the following options.

     -d          When executing a command this option makes the command become
                 a daemon after redirecting it's output to the socket

     -t timeout  The timeout in seconds to wait for the socket to be ready
                 before giving up. The default is to give up immediately on
