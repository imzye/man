NAME
     tws – 3ware 9750 SATA+SAS 6Gb/s RAID controller card driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device scbus
           device tws

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           tws_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The tws driver provides support for LSI's 3ware 9750 SATA+SAS 6Gb/s RAID
     controller cards.

     These controllers feature the LSISAS2108 6Gb/s SAS RAID-on-Chip (ROC) and
     are available in 4- and 8-port configurations, supports RAID levels 0, 1,
     5, 6, 10, 50 and single disk, with 96 SATA and/or SAS hard drives and
     SSDs.

     For further hardware information, see http://www.lsi.com/.

HARDWARE
     The tws driver supports the following SATA/SAS RAID controller:

     •   LSI's 3ware SAS 9750 series

LOADER TUNABLES
     Tunables can be set at the loader(8) prompt before booting the kernel or
     stored in loader.conf(5).

     hw.tws.cam_depth       The maximum queued CAM SIM requests for one
                            controller.  The default value is 256.

     hw.tws.enable_msi      This tunable enables MSI support on the controller
                            if set to a non-zero value.  The default value is
                            0.

     hw.tws.queue_depth     The maximum queued requests for one controller.

     hw.tws.use_32bit_sgls  Limit the driver to use only 32-bit SG elements
                            regardless whether the operating system is running
                            in 64-bit mode.  The default value is 0.

FILES
     /dev/da?       array/logical disk interface
     /dev/tws?      management interface

DIAGNOSTICS
     Whenever the driver encounters a command failure, it prints out an error
     code in the format: "ERROR: (<error source>: <error code>):", followed by
     a text description of the error.  There are other error messages and
     warnings that the driver prints out, depending on the kinds of errors
     that it encounters.  If the driver is compiled with TWS_DEBUG defined, it
     prints out a whole bunch of debug messages.
