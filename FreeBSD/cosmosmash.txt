COSMOSMASH(6)                                                    COSMOSMASH(6)

NAME
       cosmosmash - a space rock shooting video game

SYNOPSIS
       cosmosmash

DESCRIPTION
       Cosmosmash is a game where you control a base that must destroy rocks
       before they hit the ground, or you lose points.  You must also prevent
       "spinners" from touching the ground, or your base will explode.

       Press the Space key to start a standard game, or E to start a game with
       "extensions" (more on that below).  Use the left and right arrow keys
       to move your base.  Use the bottom arrow key to use hyperspace: it
       instantly puts your base at a random position.  Use the P key to pause
       the game, and to resume it afterwards.  Press the Escape key to quit
       the game.

       Extensions include an occasional falling question mark which, when
       shot, boosts your base's abilities for a few seconds.  Also, bonus
       lives are given less often.

OPTIONS
       --help Display a help page and exit

       --version
              Display version information and exit

       --initial-score=N
              Starts the game at score N (where N must be an integer greater
              or equal to zero).  This is useful to try the game at higher
              levels of difficulty.

       --ms-per-frame=N
              N milliseconds per animation frame.  Default is 58.  Minimum is
              1.  Maximum is 1000.  50 means 20 frames per second.

       --mirror-hyperspace
              Hyperspace puts the base at a position at the opposite of the
              center.  For example, if the base is 100 pixels to the left of
              the center, it will end up 100 pixels to the right.

       --no-sound
              Disables the sound effects.

       --full-screen
              Runs the game in full screen mode.

       --auto Tells the computer to control the base itself, for the enjoyment
              of the more passive user.
