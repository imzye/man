CHARMAP(1)            User Contributed Perl Documentation           CHARMAP(1)


NAME
       charmap.pl - display a FIGfont  with associated codes

SYNOPSIS
       charmap.pl [ -d=fontdirectory ] [ -f=fontfile ] [ -help ] [
       -w=outputwidth ]

DESCRIPTION
       Charmap doesn't tell you anything you can't find out by viewing a font
       in your favorite pager. However, it does have a few advantages.

       •   You don't have to ignore hardspaces (though you could do this with
           tr)

       •   It displays more than one FIGchar per FIGline

OPTIONS
       -d=fontdirectory
           Change the default font  directory.   FIGlet  looks for  fonts
           first in the default directory and then in the current directory.
           If the -d option is  not specified, FIGlet uses the directory that
           was specified when it was  compiled.   To  find  out  which
           directory this is, use the -I2 option.

       -f=fontfile
           Select the font.  The .flf suffix may be  left  off of  fontfile,
           in  which  case FIGlet automatically appends it.  FIGlet looks for
           the file first in the default  font  directory  and  then  in the
           current directory, or, if fontfile  was  given  as  a  full
           pathname, in the given directory.  If the -f option is not
           specified, FIGlet uses  the  font  that  was specified  when it was
           compiled.  To find out which font this is, use the -I3 option.

       -w=outputwidth
           These  options  control  the  outputwidth,  or  the screen width
           FIGlet  assumes  when  formatting  its output.   FIGlet  uses the
           outputwidth to determine when to break lines and how to center  the
           output.  Normally,  FIGlet assumes 80 columns so that people with
           wide terminals won't annoy the people they  e-mail FIGlet output
           to. -w sets the  outputwidth to  the  given integer.   An
           outputwidth  of 1 is a special value that tells FIGlet to print
           each non- space  character, in its entirety, on a separate line, no
           matter how wide it is. Another special outputwidth is -1, it means
           to not wrap.

ENVIRONMENT
       charmap.pl will make use of these environment variables if present

       FIGFONT
           The default font to load.  It should reside in the directory
           specified by FIGLIB.

       FIGLIB
           The default location of fonts.

CAVEATS
       The Text::Wrap in perl 5.6 or earlier operate on bytes, consequently
       the display of characters greater than 0x100 end up wrapped across two
       rows.
