NAME
     pwc – USB webcam driver

SYNOPSIS
     /dev/video0

DESCRIPTION
     The pwc driver provides support for various USB webcams.  The driver is
     based on the Linux pwc webcam driver and uses the same API.

     The following device hints may be added to /boot/device.hints to further
     configure the driver:

     hint.pwc.0.power_save
             When power_save is enabled (set to 1), the module will try to
             shut down the cam on close() and re-activate on open(). This will
             save power and turn off the LED. Not all cameras support this
             though (the 645 and 646 don't have power saving at all), and some
             models don't work either (they will shut down, but never wake
             up). Consider this experimental. By default this option is
             disabled.

     hint.pwc.0.stats
             When enabled (set to 1) frame statistics are written to the
             console each time the device is closed.

     hint.pwc.0.led_on
             This setting defines the on time for the LED (in milliseconds).
             One of the interesting things that you can do with this is
             together with the hint.pwc.0.led_off hint is to let the LED blink
             while the camera is in use. This:

             hint.pwc.0.led_on="500"
             hint.pwc.0.led_off="500"

             will blink the LED once every second. But with:

             hint.pwc.0.led_on="0"
             hint.pwc.0.led_off="0"

             the LED never goes on, making it suitable for silent
             surveillance.

             By default the camera's LED is on solid while in use, and turned
             off when the camera is not used anymore.

             This parameter works only with the ToUCam range of cameras (720,
             730, 740, 750) and OEMs. For other cameras this command is
             silently ignored, and the LED cannot be controlled.

     hint.pwc.0.led_off
             This setting defines the off time for the LED (in milliseconds)

     hint.pwc.0.compression
             Sets the initial compression preference for all cameras.  With
             this option you can control the compression factor that the
             camera uses to squeeze the image through the USB bus. You can set
             the parameter between 0 and 3:

             0       prefer uncompressed images; if the requested mode is not
                     available in an uncompressed format, the driver will
                     silently switch to low compression.

             1       low compression.

             2       medium compression.

             3       high compression.

             High compression takes less bandwidth of course, but it could
             also introduce some unwanted artefacts. The default is 2, medium
             compression.

             The compression parameter does not apply to the 645 and 646
             cameras and OEM models derived from those (only a few). Most cams
             honour this parameter.

     hint.pwc.0.fps
             Sets the default framerate when you open() the device; this is to
             accommodate some tools that don't set the framerate.  Is an
             integer in the range of 5-30.

     hint.pwc.0.size
             Sets the default size  when you open() the device; this is to
             accommodate some tools that don't set the size.  Can be one of
             'sqcif', 'qsif', 'qcif', 'sif', 'cif' or 'vga', for an image size
             of resp. 128x96, 160x120, 176x144, 320x240, 352x288 and 640x480
             (of course, only for those cameras that support these
             resolutions).

     hint.pwc.0.pad
             Normally when an application requests an image size that is not
             supported by the webcam, the driver will try to set the webcam to
             a smaller supported image size and pad the resulting image with
             borders. If you set this parameter to 0 this behaviour is
             disabled and the driver will fail image size requests that are
             not supported by the webcam.

     hint.pwc.0.fbufs
             This parameter specifies the number of internal buffers to use
             for storing frames from the cam. This will help if the process
             that reads images from the cam is a bit slow or momentarily busy.
             However, on slow machines it only introduces lag, so choose
             carefully. The default is 3, which is reasonable. You can set it
             between 2 and 5

FILES
     /dev/video0
             device node to access the driver

EXAMPLES
     To watch the videostream of your webcam with mplayer:

     mplayer -demuxer rawvideo -rawvideo fps=15:w=320:h=240:i420 /dev/video0

     To record the videostream of your webcam with mencoder:

     mencoder -demuxer rawvideo -rawvideo fps=15:w=320:h=240:i420 /dev/video0
     -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4 -o webcam.avi

     Note: Both examples assume you have already set your webcam size to 'sif'
     and fps to 15. This can be done with pwcview(1): pwcview -h -s sif -f 15
