ABDUCO(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              ABDUCO(1)

NAME
       abduco - terminal session manager

SYNOPSIS
       abduco [-e detachkey] [-r] [-f] -c name command [args ...]
       abduco [-e detachkey] [-r] [-f] -n name command [args ...]
       abduco [-e detachkey] [-r] [-f] [-l] -A name command [args ...]
       abduco [-e detachkey] [-r] [-l] -a name

DESCRIPTION
       abduco provides a way to disconnect a given application from its
       controlling terminal, thus it provides roughly the same session
       attach/detach support as screen(1), tmux(1) or dtach(1).

       If the command to execute is not specified, the environment variable
       $ABDUCO_CMD is examined, if it is not set dvtm(1) is executed.

       All session related information is stored in the following directories
       (first to succeed is used):

              $ABDUCO_SOCKET_DIR/abduco
              $HOME/.abduco
              $TMPDIR/abduco/$USER
              /tmp/abduco/$USER

       However if a given session name represents either a relative or
       absolute path it is used unmodified.

       If for some reason the unix(7) domain socket representing a session is
       deleted, sending SIGUSR1 to the server process will recreate it.

OPTIONS
       If no command line arguments are given all currently active sessions
       are printed sorted by their respective creation date. Lines starting
       with an asterik * indicate that at least one client is connected.  A
       plus sign + indicates that the command terminated while no client was
       connected, attach to get its exit status.

       -v     Print version information to standard output and exit.

       -r     Readonly session, i.e. user input is ignored.

       -e detachkey
              Set the key to detach which by default is set to CTRL+\ i.e. ^\
              to detachkey.

       -f     Force creation of session when there is an already terminated
              session of the same name, after showing its exit status.

       -c     Create a new session and attach immediately to it.

       -n     Create a new session but do not attach to it.

       -A     Try to connect to an existing session, upon failure create said
              session and attach immediately to it.

       -a     Attach to an existing session.

       -l     Attach with the lowest priority, meaning this client will be the
              last to control the size.

EXAMPLE
       Start a new session (assuming dvtm(1) is in $PATH) with

       abduco -c my-session

       do some work, then detach by pressing CTRL+\ and later reattach with

       abduco -a my-session
