FSX(1)                  FreeBSD General Commands Manual                 FSX(1)

NAME
     fsx – File System eXerciser

SYNOPSIS
     fsx [-hqVv] [-b OPNUM] [-f PATH] [-m FROM:TO] [-N NUMOPS] [-P DIRPATH]
         [-S SEED] [FILENAME]

DESCRIPTION
     The fsx utility tests file system I/O routines for correctness, with
     random input.  It generates a pseudorandom sequence of file modifications
     and applies them to a file on the file system under test.  On every read,
     it verifies the expected data.  It's highly configurable, and the test
     sequence is 100% reproducible according to a seed value.  If a failure is
     detected, fsx will log the most recent operations and write the expected
     file contents to FILENAME.fsxgood.

     The options are as follows:

     -b OPNUM
             Begin real I/O at operation number OPNUM.  Previous operations
             will be simulated, and their cumulative effect written to the
             file just before real I/O starts.

     -h, --help
             Print usage information.

     -f PATH
             Load configuration from PATH.  The configuration file describes
             the types of operations that fsx will issue, whereas the other
             operations describe how fsx will issue them.  Generally the user
             should customize the configuration file for each file system of
             interest.  See the example configuration file for documentation
             of its contents.

     -m FROM:TO
             Monitor operations within the byte range [FROM,TO). All
             operations in this range will be logged at the LOG_WARN log
             level.

     -N NUMOPS
             Terminate after processing NUMOPS operations.  If this option is
             not specified, fsx will run until interrupted or a failure is
             detected.

     -q, --quiet
             Decrease verbosity.  This option may be specified up to two
             times.

     -P DIRPATH
             On failure, save artifacts to the directory named by DIRPATH.

     -S SEED
             Seed the random number generator with this value.  By default,
             fsx will select a seed pseudorandomly, and log it to stderr.

     -V, --version
             Print the program's version.

     -v, --verbose
             Increase logging verbosity.  This option may be specified up to
             three times.

EXIT STATUS
     The fsx utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

HISTORY
     The first version of fsx was written in C at Apple Computer, beginning in
     1998, by Avadis Tevanian Jr.  It was imported into FreeBSD 5.0 by Jordan
     Hubbard <jkh@FreeBSD.org>, but only as a development tool.  It was never
     installed as part of any release.  It's had occasional enhancements since
     then.

     fsx was independently imported into Linux in 2001 by user robbiew, and
     has occasionally merged in features from the FreeBSD version.

     A tool by the same name was included in DEC Unix 4.0, but I don't think
     it shared any code.

     This version is a full rewrite in Rust, by Alan Somers
     <asomers@FreeBSD.org>.
