ExtUtils::MakeMaker::CPANfile(3)           User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       ExtUtils::MakeMaker::CPANfile - cpanfile support for EUMM

SYNOPSIS
           # Makefile.PL
           use ExtUtils::MakeMaker::CPANfile;

           WriteMakefile(
             NAME => 'Foo::Bar',
             AUTHOR => 'A.U.Thor <author@cpan.org>',
           );

           # cpanfile
           requires 'ExtUtils::MakeMaker' => '6.17';
           on test => sub {
             requires 'Test::More' => '0.88';
           };

DESCRIPTION
       ExtUtils::MakeMaker::CPANfile loads "cpanfile" in your distribution and
       modifies parameters for "WriteMakefile" in your Makefile.PL.  Just use
       it instead of ExtUtils::MakeMaker (which should be loaded internally),
       and prepare "cpanfile".

       As of version 0.03, ExtUtils::MakeMaker::CPANfile also removes
       WriteMakefile parameters that the installed version of
       ExtUtils::MakeMaker doesn't know, to avoid warnings.

LIMITATION
   complex version ranges
       As of this writing, complex version ranges are simply ignored.

   dynamic config
       Strictly speaking, "cpanfile" is a Perl script, and may have some
       conditions in it. That said, you don't need to run Makefile.PL to
       determine prerequisites in most cases. Hence, as of 0.06,
       ExtUtils::MakeMaker::CPANfile sets "dynamic_config" to false by
       default. If you do need a CPAN installer to run Makefile.PL to
       customize prerequisites dynamically, set "dynamic_config" to true
       explicitly (via META_ADD/META_MERGE).

FOR MODULE AUTHORS
       Though the minimum version requirement of ExtUtils::MakeMaker is
       arbitrary set to 6.17 (the one bundled in Perl 5.8.1), you need at
       least EUMM 6.52 (with CONFIGURE_REQUIRES support) when you release a
       distribution.
