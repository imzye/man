6TUNNEL(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             6TUNNEL(1)

NAME
       6tunnel - tunnelling for application that don't speak IPv6

SYNOPSIS
       6tunnel [ -146dhfv ] [ -u username ] [ -i password ] [ -I password ] [
       -l local_host ] [ -L limit ] [ -p pid_file ] [ -m map_file ] local_port
       remote_host [ remote_port ]

DESCRIPTION
       6tunnel allows you to use services provided by IPv6 hosts with
       IPv4-only applications and vice-versa. It can bind to any of your IPv4
       (default) or IPv6 addresses and forward all data to IPv4 or IPv6
       (default) host. For example

              6tunnel_-1_6668_irc6.net_6667

       will be enough to connect to IPv6 irc server with

              irc_foobar_localhost:6668

       If you don't wish to run 6tunnel every time you want to show your
       :c001: or :dead: IPv6 address on IRC, you can use -i parameter, which
       makes 6tunnel ask your client for specified password. Just run

              6tunnel_-i_dupa.8_31337_irc6.net_6667

       and then type

              irc_foobar_localhost:31337:dupa.8

       If your IRC server requires you to send password, specify it with -I
       parameter -- after successful proxy authentication 6tunnel will send it
       to the server.

       6tunnel can also be used as a tunnel for all other combinations of IPv4
       and IPv6 endpoints. If remote host doesn't have any IPv6 addresses,
       6tunnel will use the IPv4 one. In other cases, use -4 parameter which
       makes IPv4 address the preferred one. For IPv6-to-any tunnels use -6
       which makes 6tunnel bind to IPv6 address.

OPTIONS
       -1     Exit after first connection.

       -4     Prefer IPv4 endpoint if the machine has both address types.

       -6     Listen on IPv6 address (IPv4 is default).

       -d     Don't detach.

       -f     Force tunneling even if remote host is not resolvable at the
              execution time.

       -h     Print hex dump of every packet received or sent.

       -u_username
              Change UID and GID after bind().

       -i_password
              Act as an IRC proxy and require user to authenticate.

       -I_password
              If you are using 6tunnel as an IRC proxy and the IRC server
              requires you to send password, place it right here.

       -l_local_host
              Listen on specified address (IPv4, or IPv6 if -6 used).

       -L_limit
              Limit simultaneous connections.

       -p_pid_file
              Write down pid to specified file.

       -s_source_host
              Connect to the remote host using specified source address.

       -m_map_file
              Binds to specified IPv6 addresses on basis of source IPv4
              address. The file contains one mapping per line with IPv4 source
              address and corresponding IPv6 address. Only listed hosts are
              allowed to connect. If you want to allow any host, add mapping
              for default or 0.0.0.0 address. Example:

              192.168.0.2 3ffe:8010:18::1000:2
              192.168.0.3 3ffe:8010:18::1000:3

       -v     Be verbose and don't detach.

NOTES
       Option -H to disable all resolver hints has been removed since proper
       combination of -4 and -6 will yield in any combination of IPv4 and IPv6
       sources and destinations.

SIGNALS
       Sending SIGHUP forces map file reload.

THANKS
       #ipv6 crew, Lam.

BUGS
       Terrible man page. Hex dump doesn't include IRC proxy authentication.
       IRC proxy requires your client to send password first (don't worry
       ircii, EPIC, BitchX, mIRC and many more will work). No logging except
       debug output.
