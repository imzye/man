Catalyst::Plugin::Unicode(3)               User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Catalyst::Plugin::Unicode - Unicode aware Catalyst (old style)

SYNOPSIS
           # DO NOT USE THIS - Use Catalyst::Plugin::Unicode::Encoding instead
           #                   which is both more correct, and handles more cases.
           use Catalyst qw[Unicode];

DESCRIPTION
       On request, decodes all params from UTF-8 octets into a sequence of
       logical characters. On response, encodes body into UTF-8 octets.

       Note that this plugin tries to autodetect if your response is encoded
       into characters before trying to encode it into a byte stream. This is
       bad as sometimes it can guess wrongly and cause problems.

       As an example, latin1 characters such as é (e-accute) will not actually
       cause the output to be encoded as utf8.

       Using Catalyst::Plugin::Unicode::Encoding is much more recommended, and
       that also does additional things (like decoding file upload filenames
       and request parameters which this plugin does not).

       This plugin should be considered deprecated, but is maintained as a
       large number of applications are using it already.
