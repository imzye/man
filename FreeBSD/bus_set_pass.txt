BUS_SET_PASS(9)        FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual       BUS_SET_PASS(9)

NAME
     bus_set_pass – raise the bus pass level

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <sys/bus.h>

     void
     bus_set_pass(int pass);

DESCRIPTION
     The bus_set_pass function is called during boot to raise the bus pass
     level to pass.  The function will rescan the device tree for each pass
     level between the current pass level and the new level that has at least
     one associated driver.  The device tree rescans are implemented by
     invoking the BUS_NEW_PASS(9) method on the root bus device.
