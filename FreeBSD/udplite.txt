UDPLITE(4)             FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual             UDPLITE(4)

NAME
     udplite – Lightweight User Datagram Protocol

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/socket.h>
     #include <netinet/udplite.h>

     int
     socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_UDPLITE);

DESCRIPTION
     The UDP-Lite protocol provides a partial checksum which allows corrupted
     packets to be transmitted to the receiving application.  This has
     advantages for some types of multimedia transport that may be able to
     make use of slightly damaged datagrams, rather than having them discarded
     by lower-layer protocols.

     UDP-Lite supports a number of socket options which can be set with
     setsockopt(2) and tested with getsockopt(2):

     UDPLITE_SEND_CSCOV      This option sets the sender checksum coverage.  A
                             value of zero indicates that all sent packets
                             will have full checksum coverage.  A value of 8
                             to 65535 limits the checksum coverage of all sent
                             packets to the value given.

     UDPLITE_RECV_CSCOV      This option is the receiver-side analogue.  A
                             value of zero instructs the kernel to drop all
                             received packets not having full checksum
                             coverage.  A value of 8 to 65535 instructs the
                             kernel to drop all received packets with a
                             partial checksum coverage smaller than the value
                             specified.

ERRORS
     A socket operation may fail with one of the following errors returned:

     [EISCONN]          when trying to establish a connection on a socket
                        which already has one, or when trying to send a
                        datagram with the destination address specified and
                        the socket is already connected;

     [ENOTCONN]         when trying to send a datagram, but no destination
                        address is specified, and the socket has not been
                        connected;

     [ENOBUFS]          when the system runs out of memory for an internal
                        data structure;

     [EADDRINUSE]       when an attempt is made to create a socket with a port
                        which has already been allocated;

     [EADDRNOTAVAIL]    when an attempt is made to create a socket with a
                        network address for which no network interface exists.
