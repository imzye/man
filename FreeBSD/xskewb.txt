DESCRIPTION
       The original puzzle has each face cut by a diamond, so that there are 5
       pieces, 4 corner pieces and one diamond piece in the center.  The was
       designed by Uwe Meffert and called the Pyraminx Cube.  Douglas
       Hofstadter later coined it a Skewb and it stuck.  The puzzle has period
       3 turning (i.e. each half turns with 120 degree intervals).  The Skewb
       has 2^5*3^8*6!/2^6 or 3,149,280 different combinations (with centers
       oriented 2^5*3^8*6!/2 or 100,766,960 different combinations).

       More recently, Disney released Mickey's Challenge, its a spherical
       skewb with a pretty good internal mechanism.  Mickey's challenge has
       2^5*3^8*6!/36 5,598,720 visually different combinations).  It also
       comes with a pretty neat book.  Also released is the Creative Puzzle
       Ball or Meffert's Challenge which has 4 rings in different colors.

       Mach Balls of the Hungarian Gyula Mach are similar but they do not have
       a ratchet mechanism and do not turn as easily or smoothly.  One must
       match the 12 different symbols of 4 each at the 12 intersection points.

FEATURES
       Press "mouse-left" button to move a piece.  Release "mouse-left" button
       on a piece on the same face.  (Click on the diamonds are ignored).  The
       pieces will then turn towards where the mouse button was released.

       Press "mouse-center", or press "P" or "p" keys to toggle the practice
       mode (in practice mode the record should say "practice").  One must
       double click on "mouse-center" if the puzzle is being worked on.  This
       is good for learning moves and experimenting.

       Click "mouse-right", or press "R" or "r" keys to randomize (this must
       be done first to set a new record).  One must double click on "mouse-
       right" if the puzzle is being worked on.

       Press "O" or "o" keys to toggle the orient mode.  One has to orient the
       faces in orient mode, besides getting all the faces to be the same
       color.  To do this one has to get the lines to be oriented in the same
       direction, this only matters with center diamond piece.  This does add
       complexity so there are 2 sets of records.

       "S" or "s" keys reserved for the auto-solver (unimplemented).

       Press "U" or "u" keys to undo move.

       Press "G" or "g" keys to get a saved puzzle.

       Press "W" or "w" keys to write or save a puzzle.

       Press "Q", "q", or "CTRL-C" keys to kill program.

       Use the key pad, "R" keys, or arrow keys to move without mouse clicks.
       Key pad is defined for the Skewb2d as:
         /     Counterclockwise

       7 8 9   Upper Left, Up, Upper Right
         ^
       4<5>6   Left, Clockwise, Right
         v
       1 2 3   Lower Left, Down, Lower Right
       Note: Top, Left, Right, and Bottom only work when the control key is
       pressed and there is no analog for the Skewb3d.

       If the mouse is on a diamond, the above keys will not move cube because
       the move is ambiguous.  Also if the mouse is on a triangle, not all the
       keys will function because the puzzle will only rotate on the cuts,
       i.e. a triangle with a Upper Left - Lower Right cut will rotate only
       Upper Left & Lower Right, a triangle with a Upper Right - Lower Left
       cut will rotate only Upper Right & Lower Left.  Therefore, a triangle
       can only move tangential to the center of the face. No doubt this is
       confusing, but the physical skewb is the same way. In fact, that is
       part of its appeal.

       Key pad for Rubik3d, use must use your intuition (is this a cop out or
       what?).  The key pad is defined differently depending on which side of
       the cube your mouse is pointing at.  One thing that stays the same is
       "5" is Clockwise and "/" is Counterclockwise.

       Use the control key and the left mouse button, keypad, or arrow keys to
       move the whole cube.  This is not recorded as a turn.

       The title is in the following format (non-motif version):
              xskewb{2|3}d<dimension>: (<Number of moves>/{<Record number of
              moves> <username>|"NEVER noaccess"|"practice"}) - <Comment>
       If there is no record of the current puzzle, it displays "NEVER
       noaccess".

OPTIONS
       -geometry {+|-}X{+|-}Y
               This option sets the initial position of the skewb window
               (resource name "geometry").

       -display host:dpy
               This option specifies the X server to contact.

       -[no]mono
               This option allows you to  display on a color screen as if
               monochrome (resource name "mono").

       -[no]{reverse|rv}
               This option allows you to see the skewb window in reverse video
               (resource name "reverse").

       -{foreground|fg} color
               This option specifies the foreground of the skewb window
               (resource name "foreground").

       -{background|bg} color
               This option specifies the background of the skewb window
               (resource name "background").

       -{border|bd} color
               This option specifies the border color of the cubelets in the
               skewb window (resource name "borderColor").

       -face{0|1|2|3|4|5} <color>
               This option allows you to change the color of a face (resource
               name "faceColorN"). In mono-mode, color is represented as the
               first letter of the color name. On the 2-D version, the faces
               are ordered top to bottom and left to right on the "t"
               configuration. The "+-" configuration is physically consistent
               with the former, so it is ordered "0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 4".  If you
               has two colors that begin with the same letter you should have
               one in uppercase and one in lowercase to distinguish them in
               mono-mode. You can change the colors of the faces to make a
               stupid cube (i.e. all White or in mono-mode all "W").
               Unfortunately, it will not normally say its solved when its
               randomized. This would be cheating.

       -[no]orient
               This option allows you to access the orient mode (resource name
               "orient").

       -[no]practice
               This option allows you to access the practice mode (resource
               name "practice").

       -username string
               This option specifies the user name for any records made or
               else it will get your login name (resource name "userName").

SAVE FORMAT
       The format is not standard.  The reason for this is that this is simple
       and I do not know what the standard is.

       Skewb2d with default colors, not randomized:
         0       R     Red
       1 2 3   B W G   Blue, White, Green
         4       P     Pink
         5       Y     Yellow

              orient: 0-1 <0 false, 1 true; if 1 then lines on cubies to be
              oriented>
              practice: 0-1 <0 false, 1 true>
              moves: 0-MAXINT <total number of moves>

              startingPosition: <2 dimensional array of face and corner
              position and center diamond position, each face has 4 corner
              pieces and one center piece, if orient mode then orientation
              number follows face number: 0 up, 1 right, 2 down, and 3 left>

       This is then followed by the moves, starting from 1.
              move #: <face> <corner> <direction> <control>
       Each turn is with respect to a corner on a face.
       The corners start at the upper right and work clockwise.
       Direction is represented as 0 upper right, 1 lower right, 2 lower left,
       3 upper left, 5 clockwise, 7 counterclockwise, 8 up, 9 right, 10 down,
       and 11 left.
       Control is represented as 0 or 1, 1 if the whole cube is moved at once
       (here the corner does not matter), 0 if not.  The xskewb record keeper
       does not count a control move as a move, but here we do.

       Caution: the program may crash on corrupted input.
