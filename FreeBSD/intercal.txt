NAME
       ick - INTERCAL compiler

SYNOPSIS
       ick [options] file...

       ick -e [options] intercal-file [non-intercal-file...] [library...]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the ick command.  This manual page
       was originally written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution (but may
       be used by others), because the original program did not have a manual
       page, and was then added back to the main distribution.  Fuller
       documentation is available via the command info ick (for the ick
       command itself; even fuller documentation is available via info
       C-INTERCAL (which contains the documentation for both the compiler and
       the INTERCAL language)).

       ick takes INTERCAL programs and generates code from them (by running
       gcc).

       Note that the base in which a program is written is deduced from its
       extension; INTERCAL programs in base 2 must have the extension .i,
       INTERCAL programs in bases from 3 to 7 must have an extension from .3i
       to .7i respectively.

       No options take arguments; multiple options can be given separately or
       combined in the usual way (even -e).  The order in which options is
       given is irrelevant unless they conflict, in which case the options
       that are given last on the command line take precedence.

OPTIONS
       -c     Compile INTERCAL to C, but don't compile the resulting C.

       -d     Print yacc debugging information (implies -c).

       -t     Requires strict INTERCAL-72 compliance (rejecting COME FROM, the
              extensions for bases other than two, and other features not
              found in INTERCAL-72).

       -b     Disables the INTERCAL-72 random-bug feature.

       -O     Attempt to optimize expressions in the generated code.

       -C     Clockface output (using IIII rather than IV in Roman numerals).

       -f     Optimize control flow in generated code (prevents -yp).

       -F     Optimize everything in generated code for speed, regardless of
              how slow the compiler becomes or how large the object file
              becomes. Implies -fO, prevents -cdeghpyH.

       -h     Print optimizer debugging information (implies -cO).

       -H     Print verbose optimizer debugging information (implies -cO).

       -hH    Print optimizer debugging information in a different form
              (implies -cO).

       -w     Enable the +printflow option in output programs even if they are
              not multithreaded.

       -y     Run the yuk debugger on the code (prevents -fme).

       -p     Run the yuk profiler on the code (prevents -fme).

       -m     Allow multithreading and backtracking (prevents -ype, implies
              -w).

       -e     Link one INTERCAL file to non-INTERCAL files or to expansion
              libraries.  Doing this changes the syntax of the command line;
              the first file given must be the INTERCAL source file, then this
              can be followed by any number of files in other languages to
              link via the external calls system (currently only C and maybe
              Befunge-98 programs are allowed), and then any number of
              expansion libraries. The non-INTERCAL files will be processed to
              link them to the INTERCAL files, and then compiled with gcc and
              linked to the main INTERCAL program.

       -E     Do not link any system libraries, even if the code suggests that
              one or more is needed (prevents -P).

       -a     Allow the use of the CREATE statement (prevents -P).

       -v     Allow anything on the left of an assignment, and turn off the
              protection that constants otherwise have against being assigned
              to (prevents -fFOP).

       -P     Compile PIC-INTERCAL rather than INTERCAL (prevents -amFvxeE,
              implies -cfO).

       -o     Output to stdout rather than .c (implies -c).

       -X     Interpret ambiguous syntax such as ? and @ with Princeton
              meanings (as used by CLC-INTERCAL), rather than with the default
              Atari meanings.

       -x     Use CLC-INTERCAL rules for text I/O and for abstaining from a
              GIVE UP by label (prevents -P).

       -u     Print a message whenever the compiler tries to open a file.

       -U     Dump core on E778 as well as printing an error.

       -Y     Display the command lines for programs invoked by ick.

       -g     Leave the generated C in place, and make the output executable
              debuggable.

       -l     Attempt to report likely bugs and nonportabilities (implies -O).

       The newsgroup alt.lang.intercal is where INTERCAL compilers are
       announced, and INTERCAL itself is discussed; the website
       http://catb.org/~esr/intercal is where the most recent versions of C-
       INTERCAL are currently hosted.
