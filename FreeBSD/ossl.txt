OSSL(4)                FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                OSSL(4)

NAME
     ossl – driver using OpenSSL assembly routines

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device crypto
           device cryptodev
           device ossl

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           ossl_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The OpenSSL distribution includes architecture-specific implementations
     for some commonly used cryptographic algorithms.  This driver adds a
     wrapper around these routines permitting them to be used by in-kernel
     cryptography consumers such as kernel TLS and IPsec.

     The ossl driver includes architecture-specific implementations for the
     following architectures:

     •   arm64
     •   amd64
     •   i386

     The ossl driver includes support for the following algorithms:

     •   ChaCha20
     •   ChaCha20-Poly1305 (RFC 8439)
     •   Poly1305
     •   SHA1
     •   SHA1-HMAC
     •   SHA2-224
     •   SHA2-224-HMAC
     •   SHA2-256
     •   SHA2-256-HMAC
     •   SHA2-384
     •   SHA2-384-HMAC
     •   SHA2-512
     •   SHA2-512-HMAC
