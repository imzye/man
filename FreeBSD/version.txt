VERSION.4TH(8)          FreeBSD System Manager's Manual         VERSION.4TH(8)

NAME
     version.4th – FreeBSD version string boot module

DESCRIPTION
     The file that goes by the name of version.4th is a set of commands
     designed to draw the boot loader version at the bottom-right of the
     screen.  The commands of version.4th by themselves are not enough for
     most uses.  Please refer to the examples below for the most common
     situations, and to loader(8) for additional commands.

     Before using any of the commands provided in version.4th, it must be
     included through the command:

           include version.4th

     This line is present in the default /boot/menu.rc file, so it is not
     needed (and should not be re-issued) in a normal setup.

     The commands provided by it are:

           print_version          Prints the contents of the loader_version
                                  environment variable right-justified at the
                                  column loader_version_x and row
                                  loader_version_y.

     The environment variables that effect its behavior are:

           loader_version
                     Set automatically by loader(8), but you can override it
                     by setting in loader.conf(5).  This should be the version
                     of boot loader used.

           loader_version_x
                     Sets the desired ending column position of
                     loader_version.  Default is 80.

           loader_version_y
                     Sets the desired ending row position of loader_version.
                     Default is 24.

           loader_color
                     If set to “NO” (case-insensitive) or “0”, causes the
                     version to be printed without color (default is ANSI
                     Cyan).

FILES
     /boot/loader       The loader(8).
     /boot/version.4th  version.4th itself.
     /boot/loader.rc    loader(8) bootstrapping script.

EXAMPLES
     Override loader(8) version in loader.conf(5):

           loader_version="loader 1.1"
