VCF2HAP(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             VCF2HAP(1)

NAME
       VCF2HAP - Generate haplotype file from a VCF




SYNOPSIS
       vcf2hap [--xz] sample-ID < sample.vcf[.xz] > sample.hap
       bcftools view sample.bcf | vcf2hap sample-ID > sample.hap


OPTIONS
       --xz   VCF input is compressed with xz


PURPOSE
       vcf2hap is a simple tool for generating a .hap file as required by
       haplohseq from a VCF input, which is assumed to be phased.


DESCRIPTION
       The sample-ID provided on the command line is a arbitary string which
       will be included in the .hap output.

       Specify the --xz flag if the input is xz-compressed.

       vcf2hap is extremely fast (about 19 times faster than format_hap.py)
       and requires a trivial amount of memory regardless of the size of the
       VCF file.  Performance is important as it is often necessary to
       haplotype tens of thousands of large VCF files.
