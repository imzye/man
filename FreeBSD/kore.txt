NAME
       kodev - Kore project management tool


SYNOPSIS
       kodev [OPTION] ...


DESCRIPTION
       This documentation describes the application management tools for
       building and running a Kore project. For information regarding the
       technical interface and C bindings, look to kore(3) where these
       functions and structures are described.  Kore projects may be managed
       using the following OPTIONS;

       create
              Create a new application skeleton with the name that is passed
              to it. This will create a new directory with all the files
              required to begin hacking. See the GENERATED FILES section for
              more information.

       build
              Build the application. See the BUILDING section for more
              information.

       run
              Start the application in the foreground. See the RUNNING section
              for more information.

       reload
              Reload the application. This is a shortcut to sending SIGHUP to
              the parent process (see kore_pid).

       info
              Show information about the application configuration. Namely;
              active flavor, output type, Kore features, Kore source and Kore
              binary.

       clean
              Cleanup the build files.

       flavor
              Switch between build flavors with the argument being the new
              flavor.

       help
              Show the help synopsis.


GENERATED FILES
       Executing the create command will generate several new files under the
       directory matching the application name specified.

       These files are:

              conf/build.conf
                     The build configuration.

              conf/app.conf
                     The Kore application configuration.

              src/app.c
                     The initial placeholder source code.

              cert/server.pem
                     The self-signed auto-generated x509 certificate.

              cert/key.pem
                     The key matching the self-signed x509 certificate.

              dh2048.pem
                     The 2048-bit DH parameters used by TLS.

       Those files are:

              kore.conf
                     The Kore application configuration.

              handlers.py
                     The initial placeholder python page handler.

              __init__.py
                     The python initialization code. Sets up the kore
                     listener, etc.

              cert/server.pem
                     The self-signed auto-generated x509 certificate.

              cert/key.pem
                     The key matching the self-signed x509 certificate.

              dh2048.pem
                     The 2048-bit DH parameters used by TLS.



BUILDING
       Executing the build command will build your application. How this
       happens is instructed by the conf/build.conf configuration file. This
       file supports the following directives:

              single_binary [yes|no]
                     If set to yes the build system will produce a single
                     binary containing both your application code and the Kore
                     code allowing you to distribute your application more
                     easily.

                     If set to no the build system will produce a standard
                     dynamically linked library that will be loaded into Kore
                     at runtime.

              kore_source [path]
                     Must be set to point to the a Kore source code directory.
                     Used only if single_binary option is set to yes.

                     Example: kore_source=/home/joris/src/kore

              kore_flavor [build options]
                     Defines the build arguments for building Kore. Used only
                     if single_binary option is set to yes.

                     Example: kore_flavor=NOTLS=1

              cflags
                     Standard CFLAGS used when compiling the application
                     source code.

              ldflags
                     Standard LDFLAGS used when linking the application source
                     code.

       Note that the build command obeys the environment variables CC and CXX


RUNNING
       Executing the run command will start your application in the
       foreground.

       What binary it executes depends on whether or not the single_binary
       flag was set in build configuration. If the single_binary flag was
       enabled the run command will execute the binary produced by the build
       system. If the single_binary flag was not enabled the run command will
       execute the $PREFIX/bin/kore binary.  In both cases the run command
       will pass the -fnr command line options to the binary.


EXAMPLES
       Changing flavor of the build;

              $ kodev flavor osx

       Building your application;

              $ kodev build
