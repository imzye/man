NAME
       URI::Match - Match URLs By Parts

SYNOPSIS
         use URI;
         use URI::Match;

         my $uri = URI->new("http://www.example.com");

         # Match just a single part of the URL
         if ( $uri->match_parts( host => qr/^(?!www).+\.cpan\.org$/ )) {
           # matched
         }

         # Match using a subroutine
         my $code = sub {
           my ($host, $url) = @_;
           return $host eq 'www.perl.org';
         };
         if ( $uri->match_parts( host => $code ) ) {
           # matched
         }

         # Match using an object
         my $object = My::Matcher->new(); # must implement "match"
         if ( $uri->match_parts( host => $object ) ) {
           # matched
         }

         # Match several parts
         my $code = sub {
           my ($path, $url) = @_;
           return $path ne '/';
         };
         if ( $uri->match_parts(
               host => qr/^(?!www).+\.cpan\.org$/,
               path => $code
         )) {
           # matched
         }

         # Match the whole URL (just for completeness)
         if ($uri->match_parts( qr{^http://search\.cpan\.org} )) {
           # matched
         }

DESCRIPTION
       This is a simple utility that adds ability to match URL parts against
       regular expressions, subroutines, or objects that implement a match()
       method.

       Since this module uses loops and method calls, writing up a clever
       regular expression and using it directly against the whole URL is
       probably faster.  This module aims to solve the problem where
       readability matters, or when you need to assemble the match conditions
       at run time.

       URI::Match adds the following methods to the URI namespace.

METHODS
   match_parts(%cond)
       Matches the URI object against the given conditions. The conditions can
       be given as a single scalar or a hash. If given a single scalar, it
       will match against the whole URI. Otherwise, the key value will be
       taken as the part to match the condition against.

       For example,

         $uri->match_parts( qr{^ftp://ftp.cpan.org$} )

       Will only match if the entire URL matches the regular expression above.
       But If you want to match against several different schemes (say, http
       and ftp) and aother set of hosts, you could say:

         $uri->match_parts(
           scheme => qr{^(?:ftp|http)$},
           host   => qr{^.+\.example\.com$}
         )

       Conditions can be either a scalar, a regular expression, a subroutine,
       or an object which implements a match() method. Simple scalars are
       treated as regular expressions.
