ISAL(4)                FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                ISAL(4)

NAME
     isal – driver for AES acceleration on x86 CPUs

SYNOPSIS
     To load the driver as a module at boot time, place the following line in
     loader.conf(5):

           isal_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     This driver provides an interface between the Intel Intelligent Storage
     Acceleration Crypto Library and the kernel opencrypto framework.  The
     library provides optimized routines that implement encryption and
     decryption for various modes of the AES cipher and computations of secure
     hashes.  These optimized routines use the AESNI instructions as well as
     various vector instruction extensions including SSE4.1, AVX, and AVX2.

     This driver currently supports the following algorithms:

     Algorithm      Required CPU Extensions
     AES-GCM-128    AESNI and SSE4.1
     AES-GCM-256    AESNI and SSE4.1

                    isal provides support for fewer algorithms than aesni(4).
                    However, it will provide improved performance for
                    supported algorithms compared to aesni(4).
