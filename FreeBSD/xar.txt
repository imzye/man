NAME
       xar - eXtensible ARchiver

SYNOPSIS
       xar -[ctx][v] -f archive [options] [file ...]]

DESCRIPTION
       The XAR project aims to provide an easily extensible archive format.
       Important design decisions include an easily extensible XML table of
       contents (TOC) for random access to archived files, storing the TOC at
       the beginning of the archive to allow for efficient handling of
       streamed archives, the ability to handle files of arbitrarily large
       sizes, the ability to choose independent encodings for individual files
       in the archive, the ability to store checksums for individual files in
       both compressed and uncompressed form, and the ability to query the
       table of content's rich meta-data.

FUNCTIONS
       One of the following options must be used:

       -c     Creates an archive

       --create
              Synonym for -c

       -t     Lists the contents of an archive

       --list Synonym for -t

       -x     Extracts an archive

       --extract
              Synonym for -x

       --sign Creates a placeholder signature and saves the data to sign to
              disk. Works with -c or just -f, requires --sig-size and one or
              more --cert-loc options to be set. Setting the --data-to-sign
              and/or --sig-offset option is optional.

       --replace-sign
              Rips out existing signature(s) and makes a new one. Same
              required options as --sign, but only works with -f.

       --extract-data-to-sign
              Extracts data to be signed from an existing archive. Requires
              --data-to-sign (and -f) options to be set. Setting the
              --sig-offset option is optional.

       --extract-certs=<directory>
              Extracts all certificates into DER (binary) format into the
              specified directory naming them "cert00", "cert01" etc.  The
              specified directory must already exist.  "cert00" is always the
              leaf certificate.  "cert01", "cert02", etc. are only written if
              the xar file contains a certificate chain (i.e. more than the
              leaf signing certificate).  Any pre-existing files in the
              specified directory of the same name as the certificates being
              written will be overwritten without warning.

       --extract-CAfile=<filename>
              Extracts all certificates into PEM format, concatenates them
              together and stores the result into the specified file.

       --extract-sig=<filename>
              Extracts the signature and stores it into the specified file.
              Setting the --sig-offset option is optional.

       --inject-sig=<filename>
              After extracting the data to be signed and doing the signing
              externally, injects the signature.  No attempt is made to verify
              that the signature being injected is valid other than that it
              has the correct length as previously reserved with the
              --sig-size option.

       NOTE: all of the above require the use of the -f option (filename) as
       this release of xar doesn't correctly handle pipes or sockets.

       -f <file>
              The filename to use for creation, listing, extraction or signing
              operations.  With extraction, this can be a POSIX regular
              expression.

       --file=<file>
              Synonym for -f <file>

OPTIONS
       --compression=<type>
              Specifies the compression type to use.  Valid values: none,
              gzip, bzip2, lzma, xz.  Default value: gzip

       -a     Synonym for --compression=lzma

       -j     Synonym for --compression=bzip2

       -z     Synonym for --compression=gzip (Default)

       --compression-args=<arguments>
              Specifies arguments to the compression engine selected.  gzip,
              bzip2, and lzma all take a single integer argument between 0 and
              9 specifying the compression level to use.

       --rfc6713
              Only affects --compression=gzip.  Force gzip compression to use
              "application/zlib" as the encoding style name instead of
              "application/x-gzip".  As of RFC 6713 this is the correct name
              to use for the actual compressed data format being stored in the
              archive.  This option will automatically be forced on by the xar
              library if a --toc-cksum value other than "none", "md5" or
              "sha1" is in effect.  Older xar versions will be unable to
              extract files using this encoding (and neither will they
              understand --toc-cksum values other than "none", "md5" or
              "sha1").  See http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6713 for details.

       -C <path>
              On archive or extract, xar will chdir to the specified path
              before processing archive members being archived or extracted.

       --directory=<path>
              Synonym for -C <path>

       --dump-toc=<filename>
              Has xar dump the XML header into the specified file.  "-" can be
              specified to indicate stdout.

       -d <filename>
              Synonym for --dump-toc=<filename>

       --dump-toc-raw=<filename>
              Has xar dump the raw, compressed XML header data into the
              specified file.

       --dump-header
              Has xar print out the xar binary header information to stdout.

       --extract-subdoc=<name>
              Extracts the specified subdocument to a document in cwd named
              <name>.xml

       --list-subdocs
              List the subdocuments in the XML header

       --toc-cksum
              Specifies the hashing algorithm to use for XML header
              verification.  Valid values: none, sha1, and md5.  If the linked
              libcrypto library supports them sha224, sha256, sha384 and
              sha512 may also be used.  Setting this option to a stronger hash
              than the default will also cause --file-cksum to be set to that
              hash unless it's been explicitly set to something else.  Default
              value: sha1

       --file-cksum
              Specifies the hashing algorithm to use for file verification.
              Same values and defaults as --toc-cksum.  Setting this option to
              a stronger hash than the default will also cause --toc-cksum to
              be set to that hash unless it's been explicitly set to something
              else.

       -l     On archival, stay on the local device.

       --one-file-system
              Synonym for -l

       -P     On extract, set ownership based on uid/gid.  If the uid/gid can
              be set on the extracted file, setuid/setgid bits will also be
              preserved.

       -p     On extract, set ownership based on symbolic names, if possible.
              If the uid/gid can be set on the extracted file, setuid/setgid
              bits will also be preserved.

       -n <name>
              On archival, specifies the subdocument name to use when adding
              the -s <filename> subdocument instead of the default name
              "subdoc".

       -s <filename>
              On extract, specifies the file to extract subdocuments to.  On
              archival, specifies an XML file to add as a subdocument.

       -v     Verbose output

       --verbose
              Synonym for -v

       --exclude=<regexp>
              Specifies a POSIX basic regular expression of files to exclude
              from adding to the archive during creation or from being
              extracted during extraction.  This option can be specified
              multiple times.

       --strip-components=<n>
              When extracting, strip <n> path components from the front of the
              path before creating the destination file.  If the item being
              extracted does not have enough path components to strip <n> off
              then it will be skipped and not extracted.

       --to-stdout
              Instead of creating files during extraction, write the file
              contents to standard output.  Only the file data will be written
              to standard output.  All extended attributes, resource forks and
              other file properties are ignored with this option.

       -O     Synonym for --to-stdout

       --rsize
              Specifies a size (in bytes) for the internal libxar read buffer
              while performing I/O.

       --coalesce-heap
              When multiple files in the archive are identical, only store one
              copy of the data in the heap.  This creates smaller archives,
              but the archives created are not streamable.

       --link-same
              When the data section of multiple files are identical, hardlink
              them within the archive.

       --recompress
              Normally archived files that are already compressed in a
              recogized format will be archived but not compressed (as though
              they matched a --no-compress expression).  If this option is set
              then recompression of these files will be allowed (unless they
              match an explicit --no-compress expression).

       --no-compress
              Specifies a POSIX regular expression of files to archive, but
              not compress.  The archived files will be copied raw into the
              archive.  This can be used to exclude already gzipped files from
              being gzipped during the archival process when using
              --recompress or unrecognized-by-xar compressed formats.  This
              option can be used multiple times.

       --prop-include=<propname>
              Specifies a file property to be included in the archive.  When
              this option is specified, only the specified options will be
              included.  Anything not specifically included with this option
              will be omitted.  This option can be used multiple times.

       --prop-exclude=<propname>
              Specifies a file property to be excluded from the archive.  When
              this option is specified, all file properties will be included
              except the specified properties.  Note that excluding the "ea"
              property will exclude all extended attributes (including OS X's
              resource fork).  This option can be used multiple times.

       --distribution
              Creates an archive to only contain file properties safe for file
              distribution.  Currently, only name, type, mode, and data are
              preserved with this option.

       --keep-existing
              Does not overwrite existing files during extraction.  Keeps any
              previously existing files while extracting.

       -k     Synonym for --keep-existing.

       --keep-setuid
              When extracting without -p or -P options, xar will extract files
              as the uid/gid of the extracting process.  In this situation,
              xar will strip setuid/setgid bits from the extracted files for
              security reasons.  --keep-setuid will preserve the setuid/setgid
              bits even though the uid/gid of the extracted file is not the
              same as the archived file.

       --sig-size=<n>
              Specifies the size in bytes of the signature placeholder to
              generate when using the --sign or --replace-sign options.

       --sig-len=<n>
              Synonym for --sig-size=<n>.

       --data-to-sign=<file>
              Has xar dump the raw data to be signed to the specified file.
              This is simply the raw binary bytes of the --toc-cksum hash of
              the raw, compressed XML header data.  Requires a --toc-cksum
              value other than "none".  When generating a signature, this raw
              hash value must first have the proper DigestInfo prefix added to
              it (see RFC 3447 sections 9.2, A.2.4 and B.1).  The
              --digestinfo-to-sign option automatically adds the appropriate
              prefix and should normally be used instead of this option.

       --digestinfo-to-sign=<file>
              Has xar dump the DigestInfo data to be signed to the specified
              file.  This is simply the raw binary bytes of the --toc-cksum
              hash of the raw, compressed XML header data preceded by the
              appropriate DigestInfo prefix (see RFC 3447 sections 9.2, A.2.4
              and B.1).  Requires a --toc-cksum value of "md5", "sha1" (the
              default), "sha224", "sha256", "sha384" or "sha512".

       --sig-offset=<file>
              Has xar dump the signature's byte offset within the archive (as
              an ASCII decimal number) to the specified file.  Always
              optional.

       --cert-loc=<filename>
              Specifies the location of a signing certificate in DER format to
              include in the archive.  This option can be used multiple times
              to include a certificate chain.  The first --cert-loc option
              should specify the leaf signing certificate, the next its issuer
              CA and so on so that the last --cert-loc= option specifies the
              root certificate authority for the chain.
              --leaf-cert-loc=<filename> and
              --intermediate-cert-loc=<filename> are accepted as synonyms for
              --cert-loc= for historical reasons.

       --help Show a help summary.

       -h     Synonym for --help

       -V     Synonym for --version

       --version
              Display the version number of xar.  If --verbose is given before
              --version show additional version information.

TIPS
       xar --replace-sign --sig-size=0 -f sample.xar

              Completely removes any signatures from sample.xar

EXAMPLES
       xar -cf sample.xar /home/uid

              Create an xar archive of all files in /home/uid

       xar -tf sample.xar

              List the contents of the xar archive sample.xar

       xar -xf sample.xar

              Extract the contents of sample.xar to the current working
              directory

       xar -cf sample.xar --toc-cksum=whirlpool! \
              --file-cksum=whirlpool! /home/uid

              Create an xar archive of all files in /home/uid using the
              whirlpool message digest (requires EVP_get_digestbyname support
              for whirlpool)

SIGNING
       In order to sign an archive, a leaf signing certificate in DER format
       together with its RSA private key in PEM format is required.  In
       addition, if the leaf signing certificate is not a self-signed root
       certificate then all the other certificates in the certificate chain
       (including the root certificate) should also be available in DER
       format.

       The example here assumes the DER format certificates from leaf to root
       are available in the files

              leaf.crt -> intorg.crt -> toporg.crt -> root.crt

       and the leaf.crt private key is available in PEM format in the file
       key.pem.  Also the archive to be signed is archive.xar and the openssl
       and wc utility commands are available.  The example commands are for an
       sh-compatible shell.

       1. Determine the signature size

              : | openssl dgst -sign key.pem -binary | wc -c > siglen.txt

       2. Extract the value to be signed and insert the certificates

              xar --sign -f archive.xar --digestinfo-to-sign digestinfo.dat \
                     --sig-size `cat siglen.txt` \
                     --cert-loc leaf.crt --cert-loc intorg.crt \
                     --cert-loc toporg.crt --cert-loc root.crt

       3. Create the RSA signature

              openssl rsautl -sign -inkey key.pem -in digestinfo.dat \
                     -out signature.dat

       4. Inject the RSA signature

              xar --inject-sig signature.dat -f archive.xar

       Step 1 simply places the size in bytes as an ASCII decimal number into
       the file siglen.txt.  For any given specific RSA private key, this step
       only needs to be done once as the length is determined by key
       characteristics such as bit length, signing algorithm etc. that are
       independent of the data being signed.

       Step 2, despite the name of the --sign option, only reserves space for
       the signature to be injected in step 4, inserts the certificates and
       extracts the DigestInfo to be signed.  It does not create a valid
       signature.

       Step 3 actually creates the signature using the openssl tool.

       Step 4 inserts the real signature into the archive that previously had
       space reserved for it.  This final step creates a signed archive.

       Note that whenever the archive data changes steps 2-4 must be repeated.
       Repeating some or none of those steps will result in an invalid
       signature.  Furthermore, xar makes no attempt to verify that the
       injected signature is compatible with the leaf signing certificate (the
       first --cert-loc option).  For example, if the --toc-cksum type is
       "sha1" (the default) then the leaf signing certificate's signature
       algorithm must be "sha1WithRSAEncryption" in order for the resulting
       xar archive to have a valid signature.

       More details on signing can be found at:

              http://mackyle.github.com/xar/howtosign.html

BUGS
       Doesn't currently work with pipes or streams.  Might be fixed in a
       future release.

       Signature support is clumsy and requires multiple steps and use of
       external tools.

       Should default to SHA-256 checksums if supported by the linked library
       but currently does not for backwards compatibility.

       The formatting in this man page is suboptimal.

       The option to use any available EVP_get_digestbyname hash for
       --toc-cksum and/or --file-cksum by simply appending an ! to its name
       remains mostly undocumented.

       Probably one or two more in there somewhere.  If you find one please
       report it to:
