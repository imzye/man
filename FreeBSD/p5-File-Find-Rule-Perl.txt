File::Find::Rule::Perl(3)                  User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       File::Find::Rule::Perl - Common rules for searching for Perl things

SYNOPSIS
         use File::Find::Rule       ();
         use File::Find::Rule::Perl ();

         # Find all Perl files smaller than 10k
         my @files = File::Find::Rule->perl_file
                                     ->size('<10Ki')
                                     ->in('dir');

         # Locate all the modules that PAUSE will index
         my @mod = File::Find::Rule->no_index
                                   ->perl_module
                                   ->in('My-Distribution');

DESCRIPTION
       I write a lot of things that muck with Perl files. And it always
       annoyed me that finding "perl files" requires a moderately complex
       File::Find::Rule pattern.

       File::Find::Rule::Perl provides methods for finding various types Perl-
       related files, or replicating search queries run on a distribution in
       various parts of the CPAN ecosystem.

METHODS
   perl_module
       The "perl_module" rule locates perl modules. That is, files that are
       named "*.pm".

       This rule is equivalent to "->"file->name( '*.pm' )> and is included
       primarily for completeness.

   perl_test
       The "perl_test" rule locates perl test scripts. That is, files that are
       named "*.t".

       This rule is equivalent to "->"file->name( '*.t' )> and is included
       primarily for completeness.

   perl_installer
       The "perl_installer" rule locates perl distribution installers. That
       is, it locates "Makefile.PL" and "Build.PL" files.

   perl_script
       The "perl_script" rule locates perl scripts.

       This is any file that ends in .pl, or any files without extensions that
       have a perl "hash-bang" line.

   perl_file
       The "perl_file" rule locates all files containing Perl code.

       This includes all the files matching the above "perl_module",
       "perl_test", "perl_installer" and "perl_script" rules.

   no_index
         # Provide the rules directly
         $rule->no_index(
             directory => [ 'inc', 't', 'examples' ],
             file      => [ 'Foo.pm', 'lib/Foo.pm' ],
         );

         # Provide a META.yml to use
         $rule->no_index( 'META.yml' );

         # Provide a dist root directory to look for a META.yml in
         $rule->no_index( 'My-Distribution' );

         # Automatically pick up a META.yml from the target directory
         $rule->no_index->in( 'My-Distribution' );

       The "no_index" method applies a set of rules as per the no_index
       section in a "META.yml" file.
