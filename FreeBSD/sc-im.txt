NAME
       sc-im - A curses based, vim-like spreadsheet calculator

SYNOPSIS
       sc-im [OPTION]... [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       sc-im Is a curses based spreadsheet calculator program with vim like
       key bindings.

       SC-IM is a spreadsheet program based on SC

       A spreadsheet is an interactive computer application program for
       organization and analysis of data in tabular form. Spreadsheets are
       developed as computerized simulations of paper accounting worksheets.
       The program operates on data represented as cells of an array,
       organized in rows and columns. Each cell of the array is a
       model–view–controller element that can contain either numeric or text
       data, or the results of formulas that automatically calculate and
       display a value based on the contents of other cells.

       The user of the spreadsheet can make changes in any stored value and
       observe the effects on calculated values. This makes the spreadsheet
       useful for "what-if" analysis since many cases can be rapidly
       investigated without tedious manual recalculation. Modern spreadsheet
       software can have multiple interacting sheets, and can display data
       either as text and numerals, or in graphical form. SC-IM uses ncurses
       for visual interface and has vim-like keybindings and some functional
       similarities with vim text editor.

OPTIONS
   Input Control
       FILE   The input file from where to read the spreadsheet.

       --sheet=SHEET
              Open SHEET when loading xlsx file. Can be sheet name or number.
              Default is '1'.

   Version
       --version
              Print the version number of Sc-im and exit.  It also shows which
              features were enabled when Sc-im was compiled.


   External scripts
       --nocurses
              Run interactive but without ncurses interface.

       --output=FILE
              Save the results in FILE.

       --quit_afterload
              Quit after loading all the files.  Useful when sending scripts
              to SC-IM.

       --quiet
              Set variable 'quiet'. Avoid printing info/error/debug messages.


   Other configuration variables
       --autocalc
              Set variable 'autocalc'. Recalculations occur automatically.

       --numeric
              Set variable 'numeric'. A digit starts a numeric value instead
              of a command multiplier.

       --half_page_scroll
              Set variable 'half_page_scroll'. <c-f>, <c-b> and other scroll
              mappings scroll half page instead of full page.

       --newline_action=VAL
              Set variable 'newline_action' VAL to j to move the cursor down
              after an entry. Set to l to move the cursor right after an
              entry.

       --external_functions
              Set variable 'external_functions'. Enable external functions.

       --xlsx_readformulas
              Set variable 'xlsx_readformulas'. SC-IM will try to import
              formulas, rather than the final values of a cell.


COLOR SUPPORT
       Most terminals are able to display 256 colors these days. But some of
       them enable only 16 colors by default. To enjoy sc-im's full
       capabilities, these terminals need to be signaled to enable 256 color
       mode. This is usually done by setting the TERM environment variable.

       export TERM=xterm-256color

KEYBOARD CONTROLS
       h, j, k, l, Arrow keys
              Move between cells.

       PgUp, pgDn
              One page UP or DOWN.

       gg     Jump to the first cell.

       v      Starts visual selection.

       ^      Move the cell cursor to row 0 of the current column.

       0      Move the cell cursor backward to column A of the current row.

       $      Move the cell cursor forward to the last valid column of the
              current row.

       b      Move the cell cursor back to the previous valid cell.

       w      Move the cell cursor forward to the next valid cell.

       g0     Move the cell cursor to the first visible column of the screen.

       g$     Move the cell cursor to the last visible column of the screen.

       gM     Move the cell cursor to the middle column of the screen.

       gH     Go to fist visible row on the screen.

       gL     Go to last visible row on the screen.

       gM     Go to middle row on the screen.

       mx     Mark the current cell.

       'x     Jump to a marked cell.

       =      Enter a numeric constant or expression into the current cell.

       <      Enter a label string into the current cell. Left aligned

       >      Enter a label string into the current cell. Right aligned

       {      Left justify the string in the current cell.

       }      Right justify the string in the current cell.

       |      Center the string in the current cell.

       e      Edit the value associated with the current cell.  This is
              identical to ``='' except that the command line starts out
              containing the old numeric value or expression associated with
              the cell.  The editing in this mode is vi-like.

       E      Edit the string associated with the current cell.  This is
              identical to ``<'', ``\'', or ``>'' except that the command line
              starts out containing the old string value or expression
              associated with the cell.  The editing in this mode is vi-like.

       x      Clear the current cell.  Deletes the numeric value, label
              string, and/or numeric or string expression.

       :      Enter COMMAND mode.
