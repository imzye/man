DEVCTL_SAFE_QUOTE_SB(9)                      FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual

NAME
     devctl_safe_quote_sb – Insert a string, properly quoted, into a sbuf

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/devctl.h>
     #include <sys/sbuf.h>

     void
     devctl_safe_quote_sb(struct sbuf *sb, const char *src);

DESCRIPTION
     Copy the string from src into sb.  All backslash characters are doubled.
     All double quote characters ‘"’ are also preceded by a backslash.  All
     other characters are copied without modification.  The devctl(4) protocol
     requires quoted string to be quoted thus.  This routine centralizes this
     knowledge.
