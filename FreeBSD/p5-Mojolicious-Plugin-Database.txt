Mojolicious::Plugin::Database(3)           User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Mojolicious::Plugin::Database - "proper" handling of DBI based
       connections in Mojolicious

VERSION
       version 1.10

SYNOPSIS
       Provides "sane" handling of DBI connections so problems with pre-
       forking (Hypnotoad, etc.) will not occur.

           use Mojolicious::Plugin::Database;

           sub startup {
               my $self = shift;

               $self->plugin('database', {
                   dsn      => 'dbi:Pg:dbname=foo',
                   username => 'myusername',
                   password => 'mypassword',
                   options  => { 'pg_enable_utf8' => 1, AutoCommit => 0 },
                   helper   => 'db',
                   });

               # or if you require multiple databases at the same time
               $self->plugin('database', {
                   databases => {
                       'db1' => {
                           dsn      => 'dbi:Pg:dbname=foo',
                           username => 'myusername',
                           password => 'mypassword',
                       },
                       'db2' => {
                           dsn      => 'dbi:MySQL:dbname=bar',
                           username => 'othername',
                           password => 'otherpassword',
                       },
                   },
               });
           }

CONFIGURATION
   CONNECTING TO A SINGLE DATABASE
       When connecting to a single database, the following configuration
       options are recognised:

       'dsn'         should contain the DSN string required by DBI
       'username'    the username that should be used to authenticate
       'password'    the password that should be used to authenticate
       'options'     options to pass to the DBD driver
       'helper'      the name of the helper to associate with this database
       (default: db)

       The only required option is 'dsn', every other option is optional.

   CONNECTING TO MULTIPLE DATABASES
       When you have the need to connect to multiple databases (or different
       RDBMS types), the following options are recognised:

       'databases'   A hash reference whose key is the helper name, and the
       value is another hash reference containing connection options.

METHODS/HELPERS
       A helper is created with a name you specified (or 'db' by default) that
       can be used to get the active DBI connection. When using multiple
       databases, you also get multiple helpers.
