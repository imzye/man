MPT(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 MPT(4)

NAME
     mpt – LSI Fusion-MPT SCSI/Fibre Channel driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device scbus
           device mpt

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           mpt_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The mpt driver provides support for the LSI Logic Fusion-MPT family of
     SCSI, Fibre Channel and SAS controllers.

HARDWARE
     The following controllers are supported by the mpt driver:

     •   LSI Logic 53c1030, LSI Logic LSI2x320-X (Single and Dual Ultra320
         SCSI)
     •   LSI Logic AS1064, LSI Logic AS1068 (SAS/SATA)
     •   LSI Logic FC909 (1Gb/s Fibre Channel)
     •   LSI Logic FC909A (Dual 1Gb/s Fibre Channel)
     •   LSI Logic FC919, LSI Logic 7102XP-LC (Single 2Gb/s Fibre Channel)
     •   LSI Logic FC929, LSI Logic FC929X, LSI Logic 7202XP-LC (Dual 2Gb/s
         Fibre Channel)
     •   LSI Logic FC949X (Dual 4Gb/s Fibre Channel)
     •   LSI Logic FC949E, LSI Logic FC949ES (Dual 4Gb/s Fibre Channel
         PCI-Express)

     The Ultra 320 SCSI controller chips supported by the mpt driver can be
     found onboard on many systems including:

     •   Dell PowerEdge 1750 through 2850
     •   IBM eServer xSeries 335

     These systems also contain Integrated RAID Mirroring and Integrated RAID
     Mirroring Enhanced which this driver also supports.

     The SAS controller chips are also present on many new AMD/Opteron based
     systems, like the Sun 4100.  Note that this controller can drive both SAS
     and SATA drives or a mix of them at the same time.  The Integrated RAID
     Mirroring available for these controllers is poorly supported at best.

     The Fibre Channel controller chipset are supported by a broad variety of
     speeds and systems.  The Apple Fibre Channel HBA is in fact the FC949ES
     card.

     This driver also supports target mode for Fibre Channel cards.  This
     support may be enabled by setting the desired role of the core via the
     LSI Logic firmware utility that establishes what roles the card can take
     on - no separate compilation is required.

WARNINGS
     Most controllers supported by the mpt driver suffer from limitations on
     supported disk size (mostly <2TB).  While most controllers will truncate
     usable disk size, others might behave unexpetedly and can cause severe
     data loss.  Refer to the datasheet of the chipset and firmware version
     for information about supported disk size and limitations.

HISTORY
     The mpt driver first appeared in FreeBSD 4.6.

AUTHORS
     The mpt driver was originally written for FreeBSD by Greg Ansley and
     marginally improved upon by Matt Jacob <mjacob@FreeBSD.org>.
