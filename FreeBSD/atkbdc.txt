ATKBDC(4)              FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual              ATKBDC(4)

NAME
     atkbdc – the AT keyboard controller interface

SYNOPSIS
     options KBD_RESETDELAY=N
     options KBD_MAXWAIT=N
     options KBDIO_DEBUG=N
     device atkbdc

     In /boot/device.hints:
     hint.atkbdc.0.at="isa"
     hint.atkbdc.0.port="0x060"

DESCRIPTION
     The keyboard controller atkbdc provides I/O services for the AT keyboard
     and PS/2 mouse style pointing devices.  This controller is required for
     the keyboard driver atkbd and the PS/2 pointing device driver psm.

     There can be only one atkbdc device configured in the system.

DRIVER CONFIGURATION
   Kernel Configuration Options
     The following kernel configuration options can be used to control the
     atkbdc driver.  They may be set in the kernel configuration file (see
     config(8)).

     KBD_RESETDELAY=X, KBD_MAXWAIT=Y
            The keyboard driver atkbd and the pointing device driver psm may
            ask the atkbdc driver to reset these devices during the boot
            process.  It sometimes takes a long time before these devices
            respond to the reset command.  These options control how long the
            atkbdc driver should wait before eventually giving up -- the
            driver will wait X * Y msecs at most.  If the drivers seem unable
            to detect devices, you may want to increase these values.  The
            default values are 200 msec for X and 5 for Y.

     KBDIO_DEBUG=N
            Sets the debug level to N.  The default value is zero, which
            suppresses all debugging output.

HISTORY
     The atkbdc driver first appeared in FreeBSD 3.1.  It is based on the
     kbdio module in FreeBSD 2.2.
