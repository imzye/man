NAME
       AMF::Perl - Flash Remoting in Perl Translated from PHP Remoting v. 0.5b
       from the -PHP project.

       Main gateway class.  This is always the file you call from flash
       remoting-enabled server scripts.

SYNOPSIS
       This code should be present in your AMF::Perl gateway script, the one
       called by the Flash client.

       To enable the client to call method bar() under service Foo, make sure
       MyCLass has a method called bar() and register an instance of your
       class.

               my $object = new MyClass();
               my $gateway = AMF::Perl->new;
               $gateway->registerService("Foo",$object);
               $gateway->service();

       Or, if you have many services to register, create a package
       corresponding to each service and put them into a separate directory.
       Then register this directory name.

       In the example below directory "services" may contain Foo.pm, Bar.pm
       etc.  Therefore, services Foo and Bar are available. However, these
       packages must have a function called methodTable returning the names
       and descriptions of all possible methods to invoke.  See the
       documentation and examples for details.

               my $gateway = AMF::Perl->new;
               $gateway->setBaseClassPath('./services');
               $gateway->service();

ABSTRACT
           Macromedia Flash Remoting server-side support.

DESCRIPTION
               This file accepts the  data and deserializes it using the InputStream and Deserializer classes.
           Then the gateway builds the executive class which then loads the targeted class file
           and executes the targeted method via flash remoting.
           After the target uri executes the the gateway determines the data type of the data
           and serializes and returns the data back to the client.

   EXPORT
       None by default.

CHANGES
   Sun Jul 11 18:45:40 EDT 2004
       Chaned eval{} and amf_throw() to enable die() to work as well (instead
       of amf_throw()).

   Sun Jun 20 13:32:31 EDT 2004
       Made printing output a separate function, requested by Scott Penrose.
       Wrote exportable amf_throw() for exception handling.

   Thu Apr 29 17:20:07 EDT 2004
       Changed "use Apache2" to "require Apache2" to avoid breaking on
       non-modperl systems.

   Sat Apr 24 20:41:10 EDT 2004
       Another patch from Kostas Chatzikokolakis fixing MP2 issues.

   Sat Mar 13 16:25:00 EST 2004
       Patch from Kostas Chatzikokolakis handling encoding.
       Changed non-mod_perl behavior for reading POST data from using <> to
       using read() to work around a bug in IIS
       Joined code for mod_perl 1 and 2. Separated the output code for the
       mod_perl and non-mod_perl cases.

   Sat Aug  2 14:01:15 EDT 2003
       Changed new() to be invokable on objects, not just strings.

   Sun Jul 20 19:27:44 EDT 2003
       Added "binmode STDIN" before reading input to prevent treating 0x1a as
       EOF on Windows.

   Wed Apr 23 19:22:56 EDT 2003
       Added "binmode STDOUT" before printing headers to prevent conversion of
       0a to 0d0a on Windows.
       Added modperl 1 support and (so far commented out) hypothetical modperl
       2 support.

   Sun Mar  23 13:27:00 EST 2003
       Synching with AMF-PHP:
           Added functions debugDir() and log() (debug() in PHP), added
           reading headers to service().  Added fromFile() to enable parsing
           traffic dumps.
