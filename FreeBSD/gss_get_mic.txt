GSS_GET_MIC(3)      FreeBSD Library Functions Manual (prm)      GSS_GET_MIC(3)

NAME
     gss_get_mic, gss_sign – Calculate a cryptographic message integrity code
     (MIC) for a message; integrity service

SYNOPSIS
     #include <gssapi/gssapi.h>

     OM_uint32
     gss_get_mic(OM_uint32 *minor_status, const gss_ctx_id_t context_handle,
         gss_qop_t qop_req, const gss_buffer_t message_buffer,
         gss_buffer_t msg_token);

     OM_uint32
     gss_sign(OM_uint32 *minor_status, const gss_ctx_id_t context_handle,
         gss_qop_t qop_req, gss_buffer_t message_buffer,
         gss_buffer_t msg_token);

DESCRIPTION
     Generates a cryptographic MIC for the supplied message, and places the
     MIC in a token for transfer to the peer application.  The qop_req
     parameter allows a choice between several cryptographic algorithms, if
     supported by the chosen mechanism.

     Since some application-level protocols may wish to use tokens emitted by
     gss_wrap() to provide "secure framing", implementations must support
     derivation of MICs from zero-length messages.

     The gss_sign() routine is an obsolete variant of gss_get_mic().  It is
     provided for backwards compatibility with applications using the GSS-API
     V1 interface.  A distinct entrypoint (as opposed to #define) is provided,
     both to allow GSS-API V1 applications to link and to retain the slight
     parameter type differences between the obsolete versions of this routine
     and its current form.

PARAMETERS
     minor_status        Mechanism specific status code.

     context_handle      Identifies the context on which the message will be
                         sent.

     qop_req             Specifies requested quality of protection.  Callers
                         are encouraged, on portability grounds, to accept the
                         default quality of protection offered by the chosen
                         mechanism, which may be requested by specifying
                         GSS_C_QOP_DEFAULT for this parameter.  If an
                         unsupported protection strength is requested,
                         gss_get_mic() will return a major_status of
                         GSS_S_BAD_QOP.

     message_buffer      Message to be protected.

     msg_token           Buffer to receive token.  The application must free
                         storage associated with this buffer after use with a
                         call to gss_release_buffer().

RETURN VALUES
     GSS_S_COMPLETE             Successful completion

     GSS_S_CONTEXT_EXPIRED      The context has already expired

     GSS_S_NO_CONTEXT           The context_handle parameter did not identify
                                a valid context

     GSS_S_BAD_QOP              The specified QOP is not supported by the
                                mechanism
