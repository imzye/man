NAME
       Image::PNG::QRCode - ABANDONED - Make PNG images containing QR codes
       from your text

ABANDONED
       This module doesn't compile any more on my system. Fixing the problems
       will take more time than I have available, so it is abandoned, and bug
       reports against the module will be closed without any further response.

SYNOPSIS
           use Image::PNG::QRCode 'qrpng';
           qrpng (text => 'boom shake shake shake the room', out => 'shake.png');

       (This example is included as synopsis.pl

DESCRIPTION
       This module converts your text to a PNG image of a QR code containing
       the text. The PNG image can either be stored to a file or it can be a
       scalar.

       Image::PNG::Libpng requires the PNG standard library "libpng" to be
       installed. "libpng" is usually already installed on Linux and Windows.

FUNCTIONS
   qrpng
           my $png = qrpng (text => 'this is my text');

       This makes a scalar $png containing the QR code PNG data.

           qrpng (in => 'file.txt', out => 'file.png');

       This makes a PNG file file.png from the contents of file.txt.

       qrpng options

       This function takes the following options.

       text
               qrpng (text => 'this is my text');

           The text you want to convert to a QR code.

       in
               qrpng (in => 'file.txt');

           Specify a file of text to convert to a QR code.

           If you specify both "text" and "in", the module prints a warning
           message and uses the contents of "in", overwriting the value of
           "text".

       out Specify an output file to put the PNG data into. With a scalar
           argument,

                qrpng (out => 'file.png');

           writes to file.png, but with a scalar reference,

                qrpng (out => \$s);

           writes the PNG data into the scalar $s.

       version
               qrpng (in => 'in.txt', out => 'out.png', version => 40);

           "version" specifies the "version" of the QR code. The "version" is
           the "size" of the barcode, which controls the amount of information
           it can contain. The maximum value of "version" is 40.

           If no version is specified, the program chooses one using the
           length of the text. If you choose a version which is too small for
           the input data, a fatal error occurs. Usually it isn't necessary to
           set this parameter.

       level
               qrpng (in => 'in.txt', out => 'out.png', level => 4);

           Specify the amount of error checking code (ECC) to use. The default
           is level one, which corresponds to 7% error tolerance. The level
           can go up to 4, which corresponds to 30% error tolerance. Values
           less than one or greater than four cause a fatal error.

       quiet
               qrpng (in => 'in.txt', out => 'out.png', quiet => 9);

           "quiet" is a non-negative integer which specifies the size of the
           "quiet zone", the white area around the QR code, in units of
           "modules", the size of one black square of the QR code. The default
           is four modules. The QR specification requires a minimum of a four-
           module quiet zone, but you could set this to zero if, for example,
           you are going to embed the image in a white background, so it's not
           an error to set this lower. There is an arbitrary upper limit of
           100 imposed.

           Note that changing this size makes little difference to the output
           PNG's size because it's just a white area which is compressed to
           take little room.

       scale
               qrpng (in => 'in.txt', out => 'out.png', scale => 9);

           "scale" is a positive integer which specifies how many pixels one
           "module" (one square block of the QR code) occupies. The default is
           3. You can't use fractional values. An arbitrary upper limit of 100
           is imposed.

       size
               qrpng (text => 'lime green', size => \$size);

           Get the size (height and width in pixels) of the output PNG. This
           requires a scalar reference.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Overwriting input text '$options{text}' with contents of file
       $options{in}
           (Warning) User requested conflicting options.

       No input
           (Fatal) No file or text input was supplied to "qrpng"

       quiet zone cannot be negative
           (Fatal) User value for "quiet" was negative

       requested quiet zone, $options{quiet}, exceeds arbitrary maximum of 100
           (Fatal) User requested very large quiet zone

       negative or zero scale $options{scale}
           (Fatal) "scale" was negative or zero

       scale option needs to be an integer
           (Fatal)

       requested scale, $options{scale}, exceeds arbitrary maximum of 100
           (Fatal) See "scale".

       Bad version number $options{version}: use integer between one and forty
           (Fatal) See "level".

       Bad level number $options{level}: use integer between one and four
           (Fatal) See "level".

       size option requires a scalar reference
           (Warning) See "size". In this case, the supplied value is deleted
           from the inputs.

       Return value used twice
           (Warning) The user used both the return value of qrpng and
           specified the "out" option.

       Output discarded: use return value or specify 'out => \$value'
           (Warning) The user called qrpng in void context and with the "out"
           option unspecified.

SCRIPT
       There is a script "qrpng" installed with the module:

           qrpng "earphone pad"

       makes qrcode.png. Try

           qrpng --help

       for more options.

EXAMPLES
   qrpng-data.pl
       This example makes a data URL QR code:

           use Image::PNG::QRCode 'qrpng';
           use URI;
           my $data = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz';
           my $u = URI->new ('data:');
           $u->media_type ('image/png');
           $u->data (qrpng (text => $data));
           print "<img src='$u'>\n";

       (This example is included as qrpng-data.pl
       <https://fastapi.metacpan.org/source/BKB/Image-PNG-
       QRCode-0.11/examples/qrpng-data.pl> in the distribution.)

   qrpng CGI script
       This example CGI (common gateway interface) script makes a PNG from a
       user's input.

           use Image::PNG::QRCode 'qrpng';
           use URI::Escape;

           my $request = $ENV{QUERY_STRING};
           if ($request) {
               my %params;
               my @params = split /\&/, $request;
               for my $param (@params) {
                   my ($k, $v) = split /=/, $param;
                   if ($k && $v) {
                       $v =~ s/\+/ /g;
                       $params{$k} = uri_unescape ($v);
                   }
               }
               if ($params{w}) {
                   send_qr_code (%params);
               }
           }
           print <<EOF;
           Content-Type: text/plain
           Status: 400

           You didn't send anything, use me like this: qrpng.cgi?w=message-to-encode
           EOF
           exit;

           sub send_qr_code
           {
               my (%params) = @_;
               my $w = $params{w};
               my $s;
               eval {
                   qrpng (text => $w, out => \$s);
               };
               if ($@) {
                   print <<EOF;
           Content-Type: text/plain
           Status: 500

           qrpng failed like this: $@
           EOF
                   exit;
               }
               binmode STDOUT, ":raw";
               my $l = length $s;
               print <<EOF;
           Content-Type: image/png
           Content-Length: $l

           $s
           EOF
               exit;
           }

       qrduino
           qrduino <https://github.com/tz1/qrduino> is a QR code generator
           developed by Tom Zerucha for a microcomputer platform called the
           Arduino. Image::PNG::QRCode is a fork of this project.

       libqrencode
           libqrencode <http://fukuchi.org/works/qrencode/index.html.en> is
           the library underlying Text::QRCode and its dependents.

       Google Charts QR code generator
           Google Charts offers a QR code generator
           <https://developers.google.com/chart/infographics/docs/qr_codes>.
           The QR codes generated by Image::PNG::QRCode are about 1/3 the size
           of the default Google charts ones, for example the "Hello world"
           example in the above documentation is 728 bytes, but
           Image::PNG::QRCode makes an equivalent QR code using only 243
           bytes. The reason for the reduced size is that Google Charts uses
           RGB colour space, whereas Image::PNG::QRCode uses one-bit
           monochrome colour space.

       ZXing
           ZXing <https://github.com/zxing/zxing/> is a Java project which can
           generate QR codes. These are one-bit monochrome ones.

       QrCode.net
           QrCode.net <http://qrcodenet.codeplex.com/> is a .Net version.

       JavaScript qrcode generators
           These might be a useful alternative to using a server-side
           solution:

           <http://d-project.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/misc/qrcode/js/>

           <http://code.google.com/p/jsqrencode/downloads/list>

           However, sending these large JavaScript files over the internet
           will use much more bandwidth than sending the QR codes themselves,
           for most usage cases.

       Project Nayuki QR Code generator library
           Project Nayuki QR Code generator library
           <https://www.nayuki.io/page/qr-code-generator-library> contains an
           online JavaScript QR code generator and links to implementations in
           C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, and Rust.

BUGS
       This section details some deficiencies of the module, and is probably
       only of interest to people who want to contribute to development.

       The QR code PNG files are very small and various tricks are used to
       make the memory use and the PNG file very small. Although the original
       plan was to interoperate with Image::PNG::Libpng, this ended up looking
       like a big burden to get only a small return, so this module actually
       just copies the parts of the code of Image::PNG::Libpng. If you want to
       manipulate the output PNG file you'll need to read it in again and
       operate on it.

       The module isn't optimized for repeated uses, it builds up and tears
       down everything for each image.

       The QR encoding is not checked for correctness. The QR code library
       comes from the "qrduino" project, but the contents have been worked on
       so it's not clear whether it's still correct. Also there was a bug in
       the original qrduino leading to reading uninitialized memory.

       This encoder doesn't support the "shift-JIS" format. UTF-8 seems to
       pass through it OK. It doesn't use a BOM for the UTF-8.

       The QR codes have only been checked by using two Android smartphones.
