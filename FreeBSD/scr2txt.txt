SCR2TXT(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             SCR2TXT(1)

NAME
     scr2txt – convert a video memory dump to plain text (w/ optional ANSI
     codes)

SYNOPSIS
     scr2txt [-a] [-l]

DESCRIPTION
     The scr2txt utility reads a video memory dump, such as that created by
     the vidcontrol(1) utility, and converts it to plain text representation
     of the text from the screenshot.

     scr2txt appends a newline character to the end of each line.

     scr2txt reads from the standard input, and writes to the standard output.

     The following options are available:

     -a       Emit ANSI colour escape codes to recreate the colours of the
              original screenshot.

     -l       Replace any eight-bit line drawing characters with their closest
              seven-bit equivalents.  This may result in odd output depending
              on the font in use when the screenshot was taken.

     See vidcontrol(1) for information about the input file format expected by
     scr2txt.

RETURN VALUES
     The scr2txt utility exits 0 on success or >0 if an error occurred.

EXAMPLES
     The command sequence:

           vidcontrol -p < /dev/ttyv0 > shot.scr
           scr2txt < shot.scr > shot.txt

     will capture the contents of the first virtual terminal, and redirect the
     output to the shot.scr file.  scr2txt then processes this file, and
     writes the output to shot.txt.  Of course this could be rewritten as

           vidcontrol -p < /dev/ttyv0 | scr2txt > shot.txt

     This example will take a snapshot and remap the line drawing characters.

           vidcontrol -p < /dev/ttyv0 | scr2txt -l > shot.txt

BUGS
     When remapping eight bit characters to seven bit characters, scr2txt
     should have more than one lookup table, depending on the font in use, and
     should be able to process a custom lookup table provided by the user.
