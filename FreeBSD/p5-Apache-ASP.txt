ASP-PERL(1)           User Contributed Perl Documentation          ASP-PERL(1)


NAME
       asp-perl - Apache::ASP CGI and command line script processor

SYNOPSIS
       asp-perl [-hsdb] [-f asp.conf] [-o directory] file1 @arguments file2
       @arguments ...

           -h  Help you are getting now!
           -f  Specify an alternate configuration file other than ./asp.conf
           -s  Setup $Session and $Application state for script.
           -d  Set to debug code upon errors.
           -b  Only return body of document, no headers.
           -o  Output directory, writes to files there instead of STDOUT
           -p  GlobalPackage config, what perl package are the scripts compiled in.

DESCRIPTION
       This program will run Apache::ASP scripts from the command line.  Each
       file that is specified will be run, and the $Request->QueryString() and
       $Request->Form() data will be initialized by the @arguments following
       the script file name.

       The @arguments will be written as space separated words, and will be
       initialized as an associate array where %arguments = @arguments.  As an
       example:

        asp-perl file.asp key1 value1 key2 value2

       would be similar to calling the file.asp in a web environment like

        /file.asp?key1=value1&key2=value2

       The asp.conf script will be read from the current directory for
       parameters that would be set with PerlSetVar normally under mod_perl.
       For more information on how to configure the asp.conf file, please see
       < http://www.apache-asp.org/cgi.html >
