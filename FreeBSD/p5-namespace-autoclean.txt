namespace::autoclean(3)                    User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       namespace::autoclean - Keep imports out of your namespace

VERSION
       version 0.31

SYNOPSIS
           package Foo;
           use namespace::autoclean;
           use Some::Package qw/imported_function/;

           sub bar { imported_function('stuff') }

           # later on:
           Foo->bar;               # works
           Foo->imported_function; # will fail. imported_function got cleaned after compilation

DESCRIPTION
       When you import a function into a Perl package, it will naturally also
       be available as a method.

       The "namespace::autoclean" pragma will remove all imported symbols at
       the end of the current package's compile cycle. Functions called in the
       package itself will still be bound by their name, but they won't show
       up as methods on your class or instances.

       This module is very similar to namespace::clean, except it will clean
       all imported functions, no matter if you imported them before or after
       you "use"d the pragma. It will also not touch anything that looks like
       a method.

       If you're writing an exporter and you want to clean up after yourself
       (and your peers), you can use the "-cleanee" switch to specify what
       package to clean:

         package My::MooseX::namespace::autoclean;
         use strict;

         use namespace::autoclean (); # no cleanup, just load

         sub import {
             namespace::autoclean->import(
               -cleanee => scalar(caller),
             );
         }

WHAT IS AND ISN'T CLEANED
       "namespace::autoclean" will leave behind anything that it deems a
       method.  For Moose classes, this the based on the "get_method_list"
       method on from the Class::MOP::Class.  For non-Moose classes, anything
       defined within the package will be identified as a method.  This should
       match Moose's definition of a method.  Additionally, the magic subs
       installed by overload will not be cleaned.

PARAMETERS
   -also => [ ITEM | REGEX | SUB, .. ]
   -also => ITEM
   -also => REGEX
   -also => SUB
       Sometimes you don't want to clean imports only, but also helper
       functions you're using in your methods. The "-also" switch can be used
       to declare a list of functions that should be removed additional to any
       imports:

           use namespace::autoclean -also => ['some_function', 'another_function'];

       If only one function needs to be additionally cleaned the "-also"
       switch also accepts a plain string:

           use namespace::autoclean -also => 'some_function';

       In some situations, you may wish for a more powerful cleaning solution.

       The "-also" switch can take a Regex or a CodeRef to match against local
       function names to clean.

           use namespace::autoclean -also => qr/^_/

           use namespace::autoclean -also => sub { $_ =~ m{^_} };

           use namespace::autoclean -also => [qr/^_/ , qr/^hidden_/ ];

           use namespace::autoclean -also => [sub { $_ =~ m/^_/ or $_ =~ m/^hidden/ }, sub { uc($_) == $_ } ];

   -except => [ ITEM | REGEX | SUB, .. ]
   -except => ITEM
   -except => REGEX
   -except => SUB
       This takes exactly the same options as "-also" except that anything
       this matches will not be cleaned.

CAVEATS
       When used with Moo classes, the heuristic used to check for methods
       won't work correctly for methods from roles consumed at compile time.

         package My::Class;
         use Moo;
         use namespace::autoclean;

         # Bad, any consumed methods will be cleaned
         BEGIN { with 'Some::Role' }

         # Good, methods from role will be maintained
         with 'Some::Role';

       Additionally, method detection may not work properly in Mouse classes
       in perls earlier than 5.10.
