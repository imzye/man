XROACH(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              XROACH(1)

NAME
       xroach - cockroaches hide under your windows

SYNOPSIS
       xroach [-option .,..]

DESCRIPTION
       Xroach displays disgusting cockroaches on your root window. These
       creapy crawlies scamper around until they find a window to hide under.
       Whenever you move or iconify a window, the exposed orthopteras again
       scamper for cover.

OPTIONS
       -display display_name
               Drop the roaches on the given display. Make sure the display is
               nearby, so you can hear the screams.

       -rc roach_color
               Use the given string as the color for the bugs instead of the
               default "black".

       -speed roach_speed
               Use the given speed for the insects instead of the default
               20.0. For example, in winter the speed should be set to 5.0. In
               summer, 30.0 might be about right.

       -roaches num_roaches
               This is the number of the little critters. Default is 10.

       -squish Enables roach squishing.  Point and shoot with any mouse
               button.

       -rgc roach_gut_color
               Sets color of the guts that spill out of squished roaches.  We
               recommend yellowgreen.

BUGS
       As given by the -roaches option. Default is 10.
