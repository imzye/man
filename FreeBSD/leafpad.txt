Name
       leafpad - GTK+ based simple text editor

Synopsis
       leafpad [OPTIONS...] [filename]

Description
       Leafpad is a simple GTK+ text editor that emphasizes simplicity.  As
       development focuses on keeping weight down to a minimum, only the most
       essential features are implemented in the editor.  Leafpad is simple to
       use, is easily compiled, requires few libraries, and starts up quickly.
       Currently Leafpad has the following features:


              Codeset option (Some OpenI18N registered)

              Auto codeset detection (UTF-8 and some codesets)

              Unlimitted Undo/Redo

              Auto/Multi-line Indent
