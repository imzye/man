Data::Domain::Dependencies(3)              User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Data::Domain::Dependencies - give Data::Domain the same magic as
       Params::Validate::Dependencies

DESCRIPTION
       A sub-class of Data::Domain which provides functions and objects to let
       Data::Domain use the same functions as Params::Validate::Dependencies.

       NB now this only works on perl 5.18 and higher as Data::Domain uses
       some features of more modern perls.

INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES
       As of version 2.00, Data::Domain::Dependencies no longer has the
       "generate_documentation" method. This is because of incompatible
       changes in the Data::Domain API. If you need this method then you
       should use Data::Domain::Dependencies version 1.41, and Data::Domain
       version 1.13.

       See
       <https://github.com/DrHyde/perl-modules-Params-Validate-Dependencies/issues/28>

SYNOPSIS
       This creates a domain which, when passed a hashref to inspect, will
       check that it contains at least one of an 'alpha' or 'beta' key, or
       both of 'foo' and 'bar'.

         use Data::Domain::Dependencies qw(:all);

         my $domain = Dependencies(
           any_of(
             qw(alpha beta),
             all_of(qw(foo bar))
           )
         );

         my $errors = $domain->inspect(\%somehash);

SUBROUTINES and EXPORTS
       Nothing is exported by default, but you can export any of the *_of
       functions of Params::Validate::Dependencies, and the 'Dependencies' and
       'exclusively' functions. They are all available under the 'all' tag.

   Dependencies
       This takes a code-ref argument as returned by the *_of functions.

       It returns an object which is a sub-class of Data::Domain::Dependencies
       and so has an 'inspect' method that you can use to check for errors
       when passing it a hash-ref.

   new
       'Dependencies' above is really just a thin wrapper around this
       constructor.  You are encouraged to not call this directly.

LIES
       Some of the above is incorrect.  If you really want to know what's
       going on, look at Params::Validate::Dependencies::Extending.

BUGS, LIMITATIONS, and FEEDBACK
       I like to know who's using my code.  All comments, including
       constructive criticism, are welcome.

       Please report any bugs either by email or at
       <https://github.com/DrHyde/perl-modules-Params-Validate-Dependencies/issues>.

       Bug reports should contain enough detail that I can replicate the
       problem and write a test.  The best bug reports have those details in
       the form of a .t file.  If you also include a patch I will love you for
       ever.
