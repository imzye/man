XML::NamespaceFactory(3)                   User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       XML::NamespaceFactory - Simple factory objects for SAX namespaced
       names.

VERSION
       version 1.02

SYNOPSIS
         use XML::NamespaceFactory;
         my $FOO = XML::NamespaceFactory->new('http://foo.org/ns/');

         print $FOO->title;            # {http://foo.org/ns/}title
         print $FOO->{'bar.baz-toto'}; # {http://foo.org/ns/}bar.baz-toto

DESCRIPTION
       Simply create a new XML::NamespaceFactory object with the namespace you
       wish to use as its single parameter. If you wish to use the empty
       namespace, simply pass in an empty string (but undef will not do).

       Then, when you want to get a JClark name, call a method on that object
       the name of which is the local name you wish to have. It'll return the
       JClark notation for that local name in your namespace.

       Unfortunately, some local names legal in XML are not legal in Perl. To
       circumvent this, you can use the hash notation in which you access a
       key on the object the name of which is the local name you wish to have.
       This will work just as the method call name but will accept more
       characters.  Note that it does not check that the name you ask for is a
       valid XML name. This form is more general but slower.

       If this is not clear, hopefully the SYNOPSIS should help :)

ABSTRACT
       A number of accessors for namespaces in SAX use the JClark notation,
       {namespace}local-name. Those are a bit painful to type repeatedly, and
       somewhat error-prone as hash keys. This module makes life easier.
