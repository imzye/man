NAME
       xpad - A sticky notes application for GTK+ 2.0

SYNOPSIS
       xpad [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       A sticky notes application for GTK+ 2.0.

OPTIONS
       -v, --version
              Display version information.

       -?, --help
              Display usage information.

       -h, --hide
              Hides existing pads on startup.  All pads will be hidden, so
              unless the tray icon is present or you also specify --new, xpad
              will exit immediately.

       -s, --show
              Shows existing pads on startup.

       -n, --new
              Open a new pad.

       -N, --no-new
              Prevents xpad from making a new pad on startup.  A new pad would
              be created if xpad is already running and is run again or if
              there are no old pads to load.

       -f, --new-from-file=FILE
              Create a new pad with the contents of a file

       -q, --quit
              Closes all open pads and terminates the xpad processes.
