LWP::Protocol::socks(3)                    User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       LWP::Protocol::socks - adds support for the socks protocol and proxy
       facility

SYNOPSIS
       use LWP::Protocol::socks;

DESCRIPTION
       Use this package when you wish to use a socks proxy for your
       connections.

       It provides some essential hooks into the LWP system to implement a
       socks "scheme" similar to http for describing your socks connection,
       and can be used to proxy either http or https connections.

       The use case is to use LWP::UserAgent's proxy method to register your
       socks proxy like so:

        $ua->proxy([qw(http https)] => 'socks://socks.yahoo.com:1080');

       Then just use your $ua object as usual!

EXAMPLES
        #!/usr/local/bin/perl
        use strict;
        use LWP::UserAgent;

        my $ua = new LWP::UserAgent(agent => 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.5) Gecko/20060719 Firefox/1.5.0.5');
        # for socks5, use socks like so:
        $ua->proxy([qw(http https)] => 'socks://socks.yahoo.com:1080');
        # for socks4, use socks4 like so:
        $ua->proxy([qw(http https)] => 'socks4://socks.yahoo.com:1080');
        my $response = $ua->get("http://www.freebsd.org");
        print $response->code,' ', $response->message,"\n";
        my $response = $ua->get("https://www.microsoft.com");
        print $response->code,' ', $response->message,"\n";
