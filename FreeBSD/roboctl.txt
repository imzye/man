LEGOCTL(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             LEGOCTL(1)

NAME
       legoctl - Lego robot communication and control utility



SYNOPSIS
       legoctl [flags] command [arguments]

       Enter "legoctl" with no arguments for a brief list of flags.



PURPOSE
       The legoctl command is a utility for communicating with and controlling
       Lego robotics bricks, such as the RCX, and NXT.


DESCRIPTION
       Legoctl is used to perform basic operations such as uploading files,
       displaying status information about the brick, starting and stopping
       programs, etc.

       Legoctl is based on the Robot Control library (-lroboctl), and is
       intended to run on all Unix-like compatible platforms.  It was
       developed under FreeBSD, and is also known to work under Cygwin, Linux,
       and Mac OS X.

       Since the default security settings of typical Unix systems are fairly
       restrictive, it may be necessary to adjust device permissions to allow
       non root users to use legoctl.


USB on FreeBSD
       On FreeBSD 5.x and later, this requires altering the devfs
       configuration.

       For Lego NXT USB devices, the simplest solution (for those who aren't
       concerned about the security of their USB devices) is adding the
       following lines to /etc/devfs.rules:

           [system=10]
           add path 'ugen*' mode 666 group operator
           add path 'usb*' mode 666 group operator

       Also make sure /etc/rc.conf contains the following:

           devd_enable="YES"
           devfs_system_ruleset="system"

       Then run:

           /etc/rc.d/devfs restart

       USB device nodes are created according to these rules when the device
       is plugged in.  Note that these rules make all generic USB devices
       writable to all users.

       A slightly more secure method for systems with multiple users would be
       to use permissions of 664, and add the those users whom you wish to
       have write access to the devices to the operator group.


USB on Linux (Xubuntu 6)
       Note that these are the configuration steps necessary for Xubuntu 6.
       Other Linux distributions may require additional configuration.

       Like FreeBSD, Linux USB device nodes are created on-the-fly when a
       device is connected, and are by default only writable by root.  To make
       the NXT writable by all users, create the file
       /etc/udev/rules.d/70-legonxt.rules containing the following lines:

       # Lego NXT
       BUS="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}="0694", MODE="0666"


Serial ports on FreeBSD
       Lego RCX users will need to configure a serial port for brick
       communication.  Serial device nodes are static (created at boot time)
       on FreeBSD.  To make them writable use chmod to change the permissions
       on /dev/cuaa*, and edit /etc/devfs.conf to make the changes survive the
       next reboot.  For RCX serial devices, the following rules would do the
       trick:

           perm    /dev/cuaa0  0666
           perm    /dev/cuaa1  0666

       Note again that these rules make all serial devices plugged into com1
       and com2 writable to all users.  Consider the consequences before
       setting up such rules.


BLUETOOTH
       The Bluetooth interface is currently supported on FreeBSD and Linux.
       Before you can use bluetooth, you must configure the bluetooth daemon
       for your OS, and then pair the NXT with your computer.  ("Pairing" a
       bluetooth device is like plugging in a wired device such as USB,
       Firewire, etc.)

       To configure and pair your bluetooth connection in a fairly automated
       fashion, run the lego_bluetooth_config script.  ( Included with the
       roboctl package. ) If you prefer to do the configuration manually, or
       if lego_bluetooth_config does not yet support your platform, see the
       instructions below.


BLUETOOTH ON FREEBSD
       To learn more about bluetooth options on FreeBSD, please see the
       Bluetooth section in the FreeBSD handbook.

       Note: These are the configuration steps followed by the
       lego_bluetooth_config script.  You can perform these steps manually, or
       simply run the script.

       First, the appropriate bluetooth kernel modules must be loaded.  For
       most USB bluetooth dongles, this is done using

           kldload ng_ubt

       To load the module at boot time, add the following to
       /boot/loader.conf:

           ng_ubt_load="YES"

       You can scan for bluetooth devices using

           hccontrol inquiry

       If you have more than one bluetooth channel, you can specify one for
       any hccontrol command with the -n flag, e.g.

           hccontrol -n ubt0hci inquiry

       The names of reporting devices can be retrieved using the
       remote_name_request command with the bluetooth address, e.g.:

           hccontrol remote_name_request 00:11:22:33:44:55 0 0 0

       (Substitute your device address for 00:11:22:33:44:55).

       Next, you will need to enable the hcsecd daemon.  This requires two
       steps.  First, add an entry like the following to
       /etc/bluetooth/hcsecd.conf:

           device {
                bdaddr  00:11:22:33:44:55;
                name    "NXT";
                key     nokey;
                pin     "1234";
           }

       Note that "NXT" is the default bluetooth name of the NXT brick, and
       1234 is the default passcode.  Naturally, if you have changed these
       settings on the Lego controller, you must configure hcsecd.conf to
       match.

       Next, add the following to /etc/rc.conf:

           hcsecd_enable="YES"

       To activate hcsecd, you will need to reboot or run

           /etc/rc.d/hcsecd start

       With hcsecd running, you can now perform pairing of your NXT with your
       FreeBSD box using the interface on the NXT brick.  Note that the brick
       may report "Line busy" when you connect.  This is a normal glitch, but
       will not prevent the link for working properly.  If your Lego
       controller finds your computer and asks you for a passcode when you
       connect, you have probably succeeded.

       Finally, add an entry like the following to /etc/bluetooth/hosts:

       00:11:22:33:44:55   NXT

       By default, Legoctl (and all other programs based on the roboctl
       library) will try to look up the address of the bluetooth device named
       "NXT" in the system bluetooth hosts database using bt_gethostbyname(3).
       Note that the name in the bluetooth hosts database does not have to be
       the same name programmed into the NXT brick.  This is simply a name the
       operating system associates with the bluetooth address.

       If you have more than one NXT, they will of course need different names
       in the hosts database.  You can select a non-default name on the
       command line with

       --btname name

       or by setting the environment variable ROBOCTL_BTNAME.

       In any case, the name and corresponding address must be in the
       bluetooth hosts database on your system.  See lego_bluetooth_config
       above.


BLUETOOTH ON LINUX
       The methods outlined here have been tested on Xubuntu 6.06.  Xubuntu
       has the bluetooth interface preconfigured and running in the default
       installation.  Note that this may not be the case with all Linux
       distributions.

       These instructions currently work only for root.  Additional
       instructions for making bluetooth devices available to non-privileged
       users will be added when time permits.

       You can scan for bluetooth devices using

           hcitool scan

       You can perform pairing of your NXT with your Linux box using the
       interface on the NXT brick (recommended), or manipulate the pairing
       from Linux using the following commands:

       hcitool scan                    # List devices in range
       hcitool cc 00:11:22:33:44:55    # Create connection


FILES
       /dev/usb*, /dev/ugen*, /etc/devfs.conf, /etc/devfs.rules, /etc/usbd.conf
       /etc/bluetooth/hcsecd.conf, ~/.legoctl/bluetooth_address,
       /boot.loader.conf, /etc/rc.conf


ENVIRONMENT
       There are currently no environment settings that directly affect
       legoctl.
