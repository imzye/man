NAME
     ggated – GEOM Gate network daemon

SYNOPSIS
     ggated [-h] [-n] [-v] [-a address] [-p port] [-F pidfile] [-R rcvbuf]
            [-S sndbuf] [exports file]

DESCRIPTION
     The ggated utility is a network server for the GEOM Gate class.  It runs
     on a server machine to service GEOM Gate requests from workers placed on
     a client machine.  Keep in mind, that connections between ggatec(8) and
     ggated are not encrypted.

     Available options:

     -a address        Specifies an IP address to bind to.

     -h                Print available options.

     -n                Do not use TCP_NODELAY option on TCP sockets.

     -p port           Port on which ggated listens for connections.  Default
                       is 3080.

     -F pidfile        PID file that ggated uses.

     -R rcvbuf         Size of receive buffer to use.  Default is 131072
                       (128kB).

     -S sndbuf         Size of send buffer to use.  Default is 131072 (128kB).

     -v                Do not fork, run in foreground and print debug
                       information on standard output.

     exports file      An alternate location for the exports file.

     The format of an exports file is as follows:

           1.2.3.4         RO      /dev/cd0
           1.2.3.0/24      RW      /tmp/test.img
           hostname        WO      /tmp/image

FILES
     /var/run/ggated.pid      The default location of the ggated PID file.

EXIT STATUS
     Exit status is 0 on success, or 1 if the command fails.  To get details
     about the failure, ggated should be called with the -v option.

EXAMPLES
     Export CD-ROM device and a file:

           # echo "1.2.3.0/24 RO /dev/cd0" > /etc/gg.exports
           # echo "client RW /image" >> /etc/gg.exports
           # ggated
