Finance::QuoteHist(3)                      User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Finance::QuoteHist - Perl module for fetching historical stock quotes.

SYNOPSIS
         use Finance::QuoteHist;
         $q = Finance::QuoteHist->new
            (
             symbols    => [qw(IBM UPS AMZN)],
             start_date => '01/01/2009', # or '1 year ago', see Date::Manip
             end_date   => 'today',
            );

         # Quotes
         foreach $row ($q->quotes()) {
           ($symbol, $date, $open, $high, $low, $close, $volume) = @$row;
           ...
         }

         # Splits
         foreach $row ($q->splits()) {
            ($symbol, $date, $post, $pre) = @$row;
         }

         # Dividends
         foreach $row ($q->dividends()) {
            ($symbol, $date, $dividend) = @$row;
         }

         # Culprit
         $fetch_class = $q->quote_source('IBM');

DESCRIPTION
       Finance::QuoteHist is a top level interface for fetching historical
       stock quotes from the web.

       It is actually a front end to modules based on
       Finance::QuoteHist::Generic, the main difference being that it has a
       default lineup of web sites from which to attempt quote retrieval. If
       the prospect of mixing data from multiple sites seems scary to you,
       then use one of the site-specific modules directly.

       Unless otherwise defined via the lineup attribute, this module will
       select a lineup for you, the default being:

           Finance::QutoeHist::Yahoo
           Finance::QutoeHist::Google

       Once instantiated, this module behaves identically to the first module
       in the lineup, sharing all of that module's methods.

       Most queries will likely be handled by the first module in the lineup.
       If the site is down for some reason, or perhaps that site does not
       provide quotes for defunct ticker symbols, then the other sites in the
       lineup will be attempted.

       See Finance::QuoteHist::Generic(3) for gory details on all of the
       parameters and methods this module accepts. The basic interface is
       noted below.

METHODS
       The basic user interface consists of several methods, as seen in the
       example above. Those methods are:

       quotes()
           Returns a list of rows (or a reference to an array containing those
           rows, if in scalar context). Each row contains the Symbol, Date,
           Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume for that date.  Optionally, if
           non-adjusted values were requested, their will be an extra element
           at the end of the row for the Adjusted closing price.

       dividends()
           Returns a list of rows (or a reference to an array containing those
           rows, if in scalar context). Each row contains the Date and amount
           of the Dividend, in that order.

       splits()
           Returns a list of rows (or a reference to an array containing those
           rows, if in scalar context). Each row contains the Date, Post split
           shares, and Pre split shares, in that order.

       source($ticker, $target)
           Each of these methods displays which site-specific class actually
           retrieved the information, if any, for a particular ticker symbol
           and target such as 'quote' (default), 'dividend', or 'split'.

DISCLAIMER
       The data returned from these modules is in no way guaranteed, nor are
       the developers responsible in any way for how this data (or lack
       thereof) is used. The interface is based on URLs and page layouts that
       might change at any time. Even though these modules are designed to be
       adaptive under these circumstances, they will at some point probably be
       unable to retrieve data unless fixed or provided with new parameters.
       Furthermore, the data from these web sites is usually not even
       guaranteed by the web sites themselves, and oftentimes is acquired
       elsewhere. See the documentation for each site-specific module for more
       information regarding the disclaimer for that site.
