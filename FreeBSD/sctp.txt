     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/socket.h>
     #include <netinet/sctp.h>

     int
     socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_SCTP);

     int
     socket(AF_INET, SOCK_SEQPACKET, IPPROTO_SCTP);

DESCRIPTION
     The SCTP protocol provides reliable, flow-controlled, two-way
     transmission of data.  It is a message oriented protocol and can support
     the SOCK_STREAM and SOCK_SEQPACKET abstractions.  SCTP uses the standard
     Internet address format and, in addition, provides a per-host collection
     of “port addresses”.  Thus, each address is composed of an Internet
     address specifying the host and network, with a specific SCTP port on the
     host identifying the peer entity.

     There are two models of programming in SCTP.  The first uses the
     SOCK_STREAM abstraction.  In this abstraction sockets utilizing the SCTP
     protocol are either “active” or “passive”.  Active sockets initiate
     connections to passive sockets.  By default, SCTP sockets are created
     active; to create a passive socket, the listen(2) system call must be
     used after binding the socket with the bind(2) or sctp_bindx(3) system
     calls.  Only passive sockets may use the accept(2) call to accept
     incoming connections.  Only active sockets may use the connect(2) call to
     initiate connections.

     The other abstraction SOCK_SEQPACKET provides a “connectionless” mode of
     operation in that the user may send to an address (using any of the valid
     send calls that carry a socket address) and an association will be setup
     implicitly by the underlying SCTP transport stack.  This abstraction is
     the only one capable of sending data on the third leg of the four-way
     handshake.  A user must still call listen(2) to allow the socket to
     accept connections.  Calling listen(2) however does not restrict the user
     from still initiating implicit connections to other peers.

     The SCTP protocol directly supports multi-homing.  So when binding a
     socket with the “wildcard” address INADDR_ANY, the SCTP stack will inform
     the peer about all of the local addresses that are deemed in scope of the
     peer.  The peer will then possibly have multiple paths to reach the local
     host.

     The SCTP transport protocol is also multi-streamed.  Multi-streaming
     refers to the ability to send sub-ordered flows of messages.  A user
     performs this by specifying a specific stream in one of the extended send
     calls such as the sctp_send(3) function call.  Sending messages on
     different streams will allow parallel delivery of data i.e., a message
     loss in stream 1 will not block the delivery of messages sent in stream
     2.

     The SCTP transport protocol also provides a unordered service as well.
     The unordered service allows a message to be sent and delivered with no
     regard to the ordering of any other message.

     The SCTP kernel implementation may either be compiled into the kernel, or
     loaded dynamically as a module.  To support dynamic loading of the stack,
     the kernel must be compiled with options SCTP_SUPPORT.

   Extensions
     The FreeBSD implementation of SCTP also supports the following
     extensions:

     sctp partial reliability  This extension allows one to have message be
                               skipped and not delivered based on some user
                               specified parameters.

     sctp dynamic addressing   This extension allows addresses to be added and
                               deleted dynamically from an existing
                               association.

     sctp authentication       This extension allows the user to authenticate
                               specific peer chunks (including data) to
                               validate that the peer who sent the message is
                               in fact the peer who setup the association.  A
                               shared key option is also provided for so that
                               two stacks can pre-share keys.

     packet drop               Some routers support a special satellite
                               protocol that will report losses due to
                               corruption.  This allows retransmissions
                               without subsequent loss in bandwidth
                               utilization.

     stream reset              This extension allows a user on either side to
                               reset the stream sequence numbers used by any
                               or all streams.

   Socket Options
     SCTP supports a number of socket options which can be set with
     setsockopt(2) and tested with getsockopt(2) or sctp_opt_info(3):

     SCTP_NODELAY
             Under most circumstances, SCTP sends data when it is presented;
             when outstanding data has not yet been acknowledged, it gathers
             small amounts of output to be sent in a single packet once an
             acknowledgement is received.  For some clients, such as window
             systems that send a stream of mouse events which receive no
             replies, this packetization may cause significant delays.  The
             boolean option SCTP_NODELAY defeats this algorithm.

     SCTP_RTOINFO
             This option returns specific information about an associations
             “Retransmission Time Out”.  It can also be used to change the
             default values.

     SCTP_ASSOCINFO
             This option returns specific information about the requested
             association.

     SCTP_INITMSG
             This option allows you to get or set the default sending
             parameters when an association is implicitly setup.  It allows
             you to change such things as the maximum number of streams
             allowed inbound and the number of streams requested of the peer.

     SCTP_AUTOCLOSE
             For the one-to-many model (SOCK_SEQPACKET) associations are setup
             implicitly.  This option allows the user to specify a default
             number of idle seconds to allow the association be maintained.
             After the idle timer (where no user message have been sent or
             have been received from the peer) the association will be
             gracefully closed.  The default for this value is 0, or unlimited
             (i.e., no automatic close).

     SCTP_SET_PEER_PRIMARY_ADDR
             The dynamic address extension allows a peer to also request a
             particular address of its be made into the primary address.  This
             option allows the caller to make such a request to a peer.  Note
             that if the peer does not also support the dynamic address
             extension, this call will fail.  Note the caller must provide a
             valid local address that the peer has been told about during
             association setup or dynamically.

     SCTP_PRIMARY_ADDR
             This option allows the setting of the primary address that the
             caller wishes to send to.  The caller provides the address of a
             peer that is to be made primary.

     SCTP_ADAPTATION_LAYER
             The dynamic address extension also allows a user to pass a 32 bit
             opaque value upon association setup.  This option allows a user
             to set or get this value.

     SCTP_DISABLE_FRAGMENTS
             By default SCTP will fragment user messages into multiple pieces
             that will fit on the network and then later, upon reception,
             reassemble the pieces into a single user message.  If this option
             is enabled instead, any send that exceeds the path maximum
             transfer unit (P-MTU) will fail and the message will NOT be sent.

     SCTP_PEER_ADDR_PARAMS
             This option will allow a user to set or get specific peer address
             parameters.

     SCTP_DEFAULT_SEND_PARAM
             When a user does not use one of the extended send calls (e.g.,
             sctp_sendmsg(3)) a set of default values apply to each send.
             These values include things like the stream number to send to as
             well as the per-protocol id.  This option lets a caller both get
             and set these values.  If the user changes these default values,
             then these new values will be used as the default whenever no
             information is provided by the sender (i.e., the non-extended API
             is used).

     SCTP_EVENTS
             SCTP has non-data events that it can communicate to its
             application.  By default these are all disabled since they arrive
             in the data path with a special flag MSG_NOTIFICATION set upon
             the received message.  This option lets a caller both get what
             events are current being received as well as set different events
             that they may be interested in receiving.

     SCTP_I_WANT_MAPPED_V4_ADDR
             SCTP supports both IPV4 and IPV6.  An association may span both
             IPV4 and IPV6 addresses since SCTP is multi-homed.  By default,
             when opening an IPV6 socket, when data arrives on the socket from
             a peer's V4 address the V4 address  will be presented with an
             address family of AF_INET.  If this is undesirable, then this
             option can be enabled which will then convert all V4 addresses
             into mapped V6 representations.

     SCTP_MAXSEG
             By default SCTP chooses its message fragmentation point based
             upon the smallest P-MTU of the peer.  This option lets the caller
             set it to a smaller value.  Note that while the user can change
             this value, if the P-MTU is smaller than the value set by the
             user, then the P-MTU value will override any user setting.

     SCTP_DELAYED_ACK_TIME
             This option lets the user both set and get the delayed ack time
             (in milliseconds) that SCTP is using.  The default is 200
             milliseconds.

     SCTP_PARTIAL_DELIVERY_POINT
             SCTP at times may need to start delivery of a very large message
             before the entire message has arrived.  By default SCTP waits
             until the incoming message is larger than one fourth of the
             receive buffer.  This option allows the stacks value to be
             overridden with a smaller value.

     SCTP_FRAGMENT_INTERLEAVE
             SCTP at times will start partial delivery (as mentioned above).
             In the normal case successive reads will continue to return the
             rest of the message, blocking if needed, until all of that
             message is read.  However this means other messages may have
             arrived and be ready for delivery and be blocked behind the
             message being partially delivered.  If this option is enabled,
             when a partial delivery message has no more data to be received,
             then a subsequent read may return a different message that is
             ready for delivery.  By default this option is off since the user
             must be using the extended API's to be able to tell the
             difference between messages (via the stream and stream sequence
             number).

     SCTP_AUTH_CHUNK
             By default only the dynamic addressing chunks are authenticated.
             This option lets a user request an additional chunk be
             authenticated as well.  Note that successive calls to this option
             will work and continue to add more chunks that require
             authentication.  Note that this option only effects future
             associations and not existing ones.

     SCTP_AUTH_KEY
             This option allows a user to specify a shared key that can be
             later used to authenticate a peer.

     SCTP_HMAC_IDENT
             This option will let you get or set the list of HMAC algorithms
             used to authenticate peers.  Note that the HMAC values are in
             priority order where the first HMAC identifier is the most
             preferred and the last is the least preferred.

     SCTP_AUTH_ACTIVE_KEY
             This option allows you to make a key active for the generation of
             authentication information.  Note that the peer must have the
             same key or else the data will be discarded.

     SCTP_AUTH_DELETE_KEY
             This option allows you to delete an old key.

     SCTP_USE_EXT_RECVINFO
             The sockets api document allows an extended send/receive
             information structure to be used.  The extended structure
             includes additional fields related to the next message to be
             received (after the current receive completes) if such
             information is known.  By default the system will not pass this
             information.  This option allows the user to request this
             information.

     SCTP_AUTO_ASCONF
             By default when bound to all address and the system administrator
             has enables automatic dynamic addresses, the SCTP stack will
             automatically generate address changes into add and delete
             requests to any peers by setting this option to true.  This
             option allows an endpoint to disable that behavior.

     SCTP_MAXBURST
             By default SCTP implements micro-burst control so that as the
             congestion window opens up no large burst of packets can be
             generated.  The default burst limit is four.  This option lets
             the user change this value.

     SCTP_CONTEXT
             Many sctp extended calls have a context field.  The context field
             is a 32 bit opaque value that will be returned in send failures.
             This option lets the caller set the default context value to use
             when none is provided by the user.

     SCTP_EXPLICIT_EOR
             By default, a single send is a complete message.  SCTP generates
             an implied record boundary.  If this option is enabled, then all
             sends are part of the same message until the user indicates an
             end of record with the special flag SCTP_EOR passed in the
             sctp_sndrcvinfo flags field.  This effectively makes all sends
             part of the same message until the user specifies differently.
             This means that a caller must NOT change the stream number until
             after the SCTP_EOR is passed to SCTP else an error will be
             returned.

     SCTP_STATUS
             This option is a read-only option that returns various status
             information about the specified association.

     SCTP_GET_PEER_ADDR_INFO
             This read-only option returns information about a peer address.

     SCTP_PEER_AUTH_CHUNKS
             This read-only option returns a list of the chunks the peer
             requires to be authenticated.

     SCTP_LOCAL_AUTH_CHUNKS
             This read-only option returns a list of the locally required
             chunks that must be authenticated.

     SCTP_RESET_STREAMS
             This socket option is used to cause a stream sequence number or
             all stream sequence numbers to be reset.  Note that the peer SCTP
             endpoint must also support the stream reset extension as well.

   MIB Variables
     The SCTP protocol implements a number of variables in the net.inet.sctp
     branch of the sysctl(3) MIB.

     Congestion Control

     default_cc_module
             Default congestion control module.  Default value is 0.  The
             minimum is 0, and the maximum is 3.  A value of 0 enables the
             default congestion control algorithm.  A value of 1 enables the
             High Speed congestion control algorithm.  A value of 2 enables
             the HTCP congestion control algorithm.  A value of 3 enables the
             data center congestion control (DCCC) algorithm.

     initial_cwnd
             Defines the initial congestion window size in MTUs.

     cwnd_maxburst

             burst when sending.  Default value is 1. May be set to 0 or 1.

     ecn_enable
             Enable Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN).  Default value is
             1. May be set to 0 or 1.

     rttvar_steady_step
             Number of identical bandwidth measurements DCCC takes to try step
             down the congestion window.  Default value is 20.  The minimum is
             0, and the maximum is 65535.

     rttvar_eqret
             Whether DCCC reduces the congestion window size when round-trip
             time and bandwidth remain unchanged.  Default value is 0.  May be
             set to 0 or 1.

     rttvar_bw
             Shift amount DCCC uses for bandwidth smoothing on round-trip-time
             calculation.  Default value is 4.  The minimum is 0, and the
             maximum is 32.

     rttvar_rtt
             Shift amount DCCC uses for round-trip-time smoothing on round-
             trip-time calculation.  Default value is 5.  The minimum is 0,
             and the maximum is 32.

     use_dcccecn
             Enable ECN when using DCCC.  Default value is 1.  May be set to 0
             or 1.
