NAME
       HTML::GoogleMaps - a simple wrapper around the Google Maps API

SYNOPSIS
         use HTML::GoogleMaps

         $map = HTML::GoogleMaps->new(key => $map_key);
         $map->center("1810 Melrose St, Madison, WI");
         $map->add_marker(point => "1210 W Dayton St, Madison, WI");
         $map->add_marker(point => [ 51, 0 ] );   # Greenwich

         my ($head, $map_div) = $map->onload_render;

NOTE
       This version is not API compatable with HTML::GoogleMaps versions 1 and
       2.  The render method now returns three values instead of two.

DESCRIPTION
       HTML::GoogleMaps provides a simple wrapper around the Google Maps API.
       It allows you to easily create maps with markers, polylines and
       information windows.  Thanks to Geo::Coder::Google you can now look up
       locations around the world without having to install a local database.

CONSTRUCTOR
       $map = HTML::GoogleMaps->new(key => $map_key);
           Creates a new HTML::GoogleMaps object.  Takes a hash of options.
           The only required option is key, which is your Google Maps API key.
           You can get a key at http://maps.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html .
           Other valid options are:

           height => height (in pixels or using your own unit)
           width => width (in pixels or using your own unit)
           ua => UserAgent object used internally

METHODS
       $map->center($point)
           Center the map at a given point.

       $map->v2_zoom($level)
           Set the new zoom level (0 is corsest)

       $map->controls($control1, $control2)
           Enable the given controls.  Valid controls are: large_map_control,
           small_map_control, small_zoom_control and map_type_control.

       $map->dragging($enable)
           Enable or disable dragging.

       $map->info_window($enable)
           Enable or disable info windows.

       $map->map_type($type)
           Set the map type.  Either normal, satellite or hybrid.  The v1 API
           map_type or satellite_type still work, but may be dropped in a
           future version.

       $map->map_id($id)
           Set the id of the map div

       $map->add_icon(name => $icon_name, image => $image_url, shadow =>
       $shadow_url, icon_size => [ $width, $height ], shadow_size => [ $width,
       $height ], icon_anchor => [ $x, $y ], info_window_anchor => [ $x, $y
       ]); Adds a new icon, which can later be used by add_marker.  All args
           are required except for info_window_anchor.

       $map->add_marker(point => $point, html => $info_window_html)
           Add a marker to the map at the given point. A point can be a unique
           place name, like an address, or a pair of coordinates passed in as
           an arrayref: [ longituded, latitude ].

           If html is specified, add a popup info window as well.  icon can be
           used to switch to either a user defined icon (via the name) or a
           standard google letter icon (A-J).

           Any data given for html is placed inside a 350px by 200px div to
           make it fit nicely into the Google popup.  To turn this behavior
           off just pass noformat => 1 as well.

       $map->add_polyline(points => [ $point1, $point2 ])
           Add a polyline that connects the list of points.  Other options
           include color (any valid HTML color), weight (line width in pixels)
           and opacity (between 0 and 1).

       $map->render
           DEPRECATED -- please use onload_render intead, it will give you
           better javascript.

           Renders the map and returns a three element list.  The first
           element needs to be placed in the head section of your HTML
           document.  The second in the body where you want the map to appear.
           The third (the Javascript that controls the map) needs to be placed
           in the body, but outside any div or table that the map lies inside
           of.

       $map->onload_render
           Renders the map and returns a two element list.  The first element
           needs to be placed in the head section of your HTML document.  The
           second in the body where you want the map to appear.  You will also
           need to add a call to html_googlemaps_initialize() in your page's
           onload handler.  The easiest way to do this is adding it to the
           body tag:

               <body onload="html_googlemaps_initialize()">
