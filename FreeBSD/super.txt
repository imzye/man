SETUID(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              SETUID(1)

NAME
       setuid - run a command with a different uid.

SYNOPSIS
       setuid username|uid __command [ args ]

DESCRIPTION
       Setuid changes user id, then executes the specified command.  Unlike
       some versions of su(1), this program doesn't ever ask for a password
       when executed with effective uid=root.  This program doesn't change the
       environment; it only changes the uid and then uses execvp() to find the
       command in the path, and execute it.  (If the command is a script,
       execvp() passes the command name to /bin/sh for processing.)

       For example,
              setuid  some_user  $SHELL
       can be used to start a shell running as another user.

       Setuid is useful inside scripts that are being run by a setuid-root
       user — such as a script invoked with super, so that the script can
       execute some commands using the uid of the original user, instead of
       root.  This allows unsafe commands (such as editors and pagers) to be
       used in a non-root mode inside a super script.  For example, an
       operator with permission to modify a certain protected_file could use a
       super command that simply does:
              cp protected_file temp_file
              setuid $ORIG_USER ${EDITOR:-/bin/vi} temp_file
              cp temp_file protected_file
       (Note: don't use this example directly.  If the temp_file can somehow
       be replaced by another user, as might be the case if it's kept in a
       temporary directory, there will be a race condition in the time between
       editing the temporary file and copying it back to the protected file.)
