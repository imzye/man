MSDOSFS(5)                FreeBSD File Formats Manual               MSDOSFS(5)

NAME
     msdosfs – MS-DOS file system

SYNOPSIS
     options MSDOSFS

DESCRIPTION
     The msdosfs driver will permit the FreeBSD kernel to read and write MS-
     DOS based file systems.

     The most common usage follows:

           mount -t msdosfs /dev/ada0sN /mnt

     where N is the partition number and /mnt is a mount point.  Some users
     tend to create a /dos directory for msdosfs mount points.  This helps to
     keep better track of the file system, and make it more easily accessible.

     It is possible to define an entry in /etc/fstab that looks similar to:

     /dev/ada0sN             /dos    msdosfs         rw      0       0

     This will mount an MS-DOS based partition at the /dos mount point during
     system boot.  Using /mnt as a permanent mount point is not advised as its
     intention has always been to be a temporary mount point for floppy and
     ZIP disks.  See hier(7) for more information on FreeBSD directory layout.

EXAMPLES
     Determine which FAT file system version (e.g, FAT16, FAT32) is a
     partition formatted with:

           file -s /dev/da0s1

     gpart(8) may also be used to extract this information.
