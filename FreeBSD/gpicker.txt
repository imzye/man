SYNOPSIS
       gpicker-simple [options] pattern

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the gpicker-simple program.

       You can use gpicker-simple to filter & sort arbitrary list of names by
       piping that list of names to it's stdin. Filtered & sorted list is
       printed on standard output.

       When passed -M option gpicker-simple also outputs match positions. In
       this mode each line of output is followed by line with ^ characters
       right under matched positions.

       options is included below.

       -x     Print match scores too

       -n name-separator
