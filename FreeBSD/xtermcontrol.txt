XTERMCONTROL(1)                  User Commands                 XTERMCONTROL(1)

NAME
       xtermcontrol - dynamic control of XFree86 xterm properties.

SYNOPSIS
       xtermcontrol [OPTIONS]...

DESCRIPTION
       xtermcontrol makes it easy to change colors, title, font and geometry
       of a running XFree86 xterm(1), as well as to report the current
       settings of the aforementioned properties.

       Window manipulations de-/iconify, raise/lower, maximize/restore and
       reset are also supported.

       To complete the feature set; xtermcontrol lets advanced users issue any
       xterm control sequence of their choosing.

OPTIONS
       --fg=COLOR
              Set foreground color (see also COLOR NAMES).

       --bg=COLOR
              Set background color.

       --colorN=COLOR
              Set N'th [0-15] color.

       --highlight=COLOR
              Set highlight color.

       --cursor=COLOR
              Set cursor color.

       --mouse-fg=COLOR
              Set mouse pointer foreground color.

       --mouse-bg=COLOR
              Set mouse pointer background color.

       --font=FONT
              Set font name (see also FONT NAMES). Alternatively it is
              possible to specify a fontmenu index as ´#[0-6]´ or navigate the
              fontmenu by relative sizes as ´#+N´ or ´#-N´, where N is an
              optional integer.

       --title=STRING
              Set window title. Note that mechanisms like the bash(1)
              PROMPT_COMMAND may overwrite the title.

       --geometry=WIDTHxHEIGHT+XOFF+YOFF
              Set size and/or position. Through its control sequences the
              xterm only recognize positive XOFF and YOFF offsets, which are
              pixels relative to the upper left hand corner of the display.
              xtermcontrol is therefore unable to handle negative offsets as
              described in the X(7x) GEOMETRY SPECIFICATIONS and therefore
              truncates negative values to zero.

       --get-fg
              Report foreground color.

       --get-bg
              Report background color.

       --get-colorN
              Report N'th [0-15] color.

       --get-highlight
              Report highlight color.

       --get-cursor
              Report cursor color.

       --get-mouse-fg
              Report mouse pointer foreground color.

       --get-mouse-bg
              Report mouse pointer background color.

       --get-font
              Report font.

       --get-title
              Report window title.

       --get-geometry
              Report size and position. The size of the text area is reported
              in characters and the position is reported in pixels relative to
              the upper left hand corner of the display.

       --maximize
              Maximize window.

       --restore
              Restore maximized window.

       --iconify
              Iconify window.

       --de-iconify
              De-iconify window.

       --raise
              Raise window.

       --lower
              Lower window.

       --reset
              Full reset.

       --raw=CTLSEQS
              Issue raw control sequence (see also XTERM CONTROL SEQUENCES).

       --file=FILE
              Source a configuration FILE (see also CONFIGURATION).

       --force, -f
              Skip TERM environment variable check.

       --verbose, -v
              Print verbose reports.

       --help, -h
              Print help message and exit.

       --version
              Print the version number and exit.

CONFIGURATION
       The default configuration file ~/.xtermcontrol is sourced if
       xtermcontrol is run without options or if specifically requested, e.g.
       'xtermcontrol --file=~/.xtermcontrol'.

       Each line in a configuration file is either a comment or contains an
       attribute.  Attributes consist of a keyword and an associated value:

             keyword = value # comment

       The valid keyword/value combinations are:

             foreground="COLOR"
             background="COLOR"
             highlight="COLOR"
             cursor="COLOR"
             mouse-foreground="COLOR"
             mouse-background="COLOR"
             geometry="WIDTHxHEIGHT+XOFF+YOFF"
             font="FONT"
             color0="COLOR"
             color1="COLOR"
             color2="COLOR"
             color3="COLOR"
             color4="COLOR"
             color5="COLOR"
             color6="COLOR"
             color7="COLOR"
             color8="COLOR"
             color9="COLOR"
             color10="COLOR"
             color11="COLOR"
             color12="COLOR"
             color13="COLOR"
             color14="COLOR"
             color15="COLOR"

       Whitespace is ignored in attributes unless within a quoted value. The
       character ´#´ is taken to begin a comment. Each ´#´ and all remaining
       characters on that line is ignored.

FONT NAMES
       xtermcontrol accepts any X(7x) FONT NAMES.  Font names like
       ´-adobe-courier-medium-r-normal--10-100-75-75-m-60-iso8859-1´ are very
       cumbersome to write, so it is convenient to make use of aliases, e.g.
       ´fixed´ or ´8x13´, if present in fonts.alias files of the font
       directories.

COLOR NAMES
       xtermcontrol accepts any X(7x) COLOR NAMES.  Basically this means that
       colors are specified by name or rgb value, e.g. ´blue´,
       ´rgb:0000/0000/FFFF´ or ´#00F´. Colors are typically reported by the
       xterm in a device-dependent numerical form, e.g. ´rgb:0000/0000/FFFF´.
       Note that old syntax rgb values should always be quoted to avoid ´#´
       being interpreted as the beginning of a comment by the shell (see also
       FILES).

XTERM CONTROL SEQUENCES
       The secret behind xtermcontrol is xterm control sequences. All the
       possible (there are a plethora of them) control sequences are
       documented in ctlseqs.txt, found in the xterm(1) distribution (see also
       FILES).

OS X Terminal.app
       The OS X Terminal.app emulates an extended set of the VTxxx series
       commands, closely resembling dtterm.  Therefore the following subset of
       xtermcontrol options works as expected:

             --title
             --geometry
             --get-geometry
             --maximize
             --restore
             --iconify
             --de-iconify
             --raise
             --lower
             --reset


TROUBLESHOOTING
       If read/write permissions on the tty's are changed so that special
       group membership is required to be able to write to the pseudo
       terminal, the easiest workaround is to install xtermcontrol setuid
       root.

       Xterm(1) has three resources, allowWindowOps, allowTitleOps, and
       allowFontOps, that enables or disables special operations which
       xtermcontrol relies on.  If any of these resources are set (or
       defaults) to 'false' xtermcontrol may hang.  The resources corresponds
       to xtermcontrol options as:

          allowWindowOps:
             --raise
             --lower
             --restore
             --maximize
             --iconify
             --de-iconify
             --get-title
             --geometry
             --get-geometry

          allowTitleOps:
             --title

          allowFontOps:
             --font
             --get-font

       All three resources can usually be enabled for the current xterm
       session via a menu; ctrl+rightclick and look for menu item names like
       'Allow Window Ops'. To set these resource values persistently you can
       add the following to either your local ~/.Xdefaults file, or to a
       system-wide resource file like /etc/X11/app-defaults/XTerm:

          *VT100.allowWindowOps: true
          *VT100.allowTitleOps: true
          *VT100.allowFontOps: true
