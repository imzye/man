RSU(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 RSU(4)

NAME
     rsu – Realtek RTL8188SU/RTL8192SU USB IEEE 802.11b/g/n wireless network
     device

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device ehci
           device uhci
           device ohci
           device usb
           device rsu
           device rsufw
           device wlan

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following lines in loader.conf(5):

           if_rsu_load="YES"
           rsu-rtl8712fw_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The rsu driver supports USB 2.0 wireless network devices based on Realtek
     RTL8188SU, RTL8191SU and RTL8192SU chipsets.

     The RTL8188SU is a highly integrated 802.11n adapter that combines a MAC,
     a 1T1R capable baseband and an RF in a single chip.  It operates in the
     2GHz spectrum only.

     The RTL8191SU is a highly integrated multiple-in, single-out (MISO)
     802.11n adapter that combines a MAC, a 1T2R capable baseband and an RF in
     a single chip.  It operates in the 2GHz spectrum only.

     The RTL8192SU is a highly integrated multiple-in, multiple-out (MIMO)
     802.11n adapter that combines a MAC, a 2T2R capable baseband and an RF in
     a single chip.  It operates in the 2GHz spectrum only.

     These are the modes the rsu driver can operate in:

     BSS mode       Also known as infrastructure mode, this is used when
                    associating with an access point, through which all
                    traffic passes.  This mode is the default.

     monitor mode   In this mode the driver is able to receive packets without
                    associating with an access point.  This disables the
                    internal receive filter and enables the card to capture
                    packets from networks which it wouldn't normally have
                    access to, or to scan for access points.

     The rsu driver can be configured to use Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) or
     Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA-PSK and WPA2-PSK).  WPA is the de facto
     encryption standard for wireless networks.  It is strongly recommended
     that WEP not be used as the sole mechanism to secure wireless
     communication, due to serious weaknesses in it.

     The rsu driver can be configured at runtime with ifconfig(8).

FILES
     /usr/share/doc/legal/realtek.LICENSE      rsu firmware license

     The driver needs at least version 1.2 of the following firmware file,
     which is loaded when an interface is attached:

           /boot/kernel/rsu-rtl8712fw.ko

HARDWARE
     The rsu driver provices support for Realtek RTL8188SU/RTL8192SU USB IEEE
     802.11b/g/n wireless network adapters, including:

           ASUS USB-N10
           ASUS WL-167G V3
           Belkin F7D1101 v1
           D-Link DWA-131 A1
           EDUP EP-MS150N(W)
           Edimax EW-7622UMN
           Hercules HWGUn-54
           Hercules HWNUm-300
           Planex GW-USNano
           Sitecom WL-349 v1
           Sitecom WL-353
           Sweex LW154
           TRENDnet TEW-646UBH
           TRENDnet TEW-648UB
           TRENDnet TEW-649UB

EXAMPLES
     Join an existing BSS network (i.e., connect to an access point):

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev rsu0 inet 192.168.0.20 \
               netmask 0xffffff00

     Join a specific BSS network with network name “my_net”:

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev rsu0 ssid my_net up

     Join a specific BSS network with 64-bit WEP encryption:

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev rsu0 ssid my_net \
                   wepmode on wepkey 0x1234567890 weptxkey 1 up

DIAGNOSTICS
     %s: failed load firmware of file rsu-rtl8712fw  For some reason, the
     driver was unable to read the microcode file from the filesystem.  The
     file might be missing or corrupted.

     device timeout  A frame dispatched to the hardware for transmission did
     not complete in time.  The driver will reset the hardware.  This should
     not happen.

HISTORY
     The rsu driver first appeared in OpenBSD 4.9 and FreeBSD 10.0.

AUTHORS
     The rsu driver was written by Damien Bergamini <damien@openbsd.org> and
     ported by Rui Paulo <rpaulo@freebsd.org>.  The 802.11n support was added
     by Adrian Chadd <adrian@freebsd.org>.

CAVEATS
     The rsu driver currently does not support 802.11n transmit aggregation,
     either A-MSDU or A-MPDU.

     The rsu driver does not capture management frames in non-monitor modes;
     without this limitation some firmware functions (e.g., 'join bss') will
     not work properly.
