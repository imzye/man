CHKGRP(8)               FreeBSD System Manager's Manual              CHKGRP(8)

NAME
     chkgrp – check the syntax of the group file

SYNOPSIS
     chkgrp [-q] [groupfile]

DESCRIPTION
     The chkgrp utility scans the given file or, failing that, the system-wide
     group file for errors.  Specifically, it checks that every non-blank,
     non-comment entry is composed of four colon-separated fields, that none
     of them contains whitespace, and that the third field (the group ID) is
     numeric.  It will also check for invalid characters in the group names
     and group members.  The following options are available:

     -q      This option disables printing of text when the group format is
             correct.

FILES
     /etc/group  group database file

EXIT STATUS
     The chkgrp utility returns EX_DATAERR if errors were found in the group
     file, and EX_OK otherwise.

DIAGNOSTICS
     For each error found, chkgrp will print an error message containing the
     name of the file being scanned and the line number on which the error was
     found.

SEE ALSO
     getgrent(3), group(5)
