DESCRIPTION
       WARNING: A lot has changed with the 1.01 release.  Please read more
       about these changes in the file "explain_101.txt" included in the
       distribution.

       The "cpansite" script is used to create your own CPAN server. The logic
       is implemented in CPAN::Site::Index which you may use directly.  You
       only need to install this module on one server in your network.

       There are two kinds of local CPANs which can be constructed with this
       software:

       1. local CPAN with fallback to the global CPAN
           When you generate a new index for your local set-up, the default
           behavior is to merge that knowledge with the global CPAN. When you
           install a module on a client, it will first attempt to fetch it
           from your own set-up. If not found, it will automatically continue
           to look at the global CPAN.

       2. pure local CPAN, without fallback
           When you choose to generate the index without fallback, the
           installation of a module will fail when you do not have a local
           copy of the module in your set-up. You can use the "mirror" action
           to collect the latest version of a module into your own structure.

   Indexing options
       The following options are available with all actions:

       --verbose -v -vv -vvv --mode=DEBUG
           Produce verbose output via Log::Report.

       --site <dir>  or  -s <dir>  or   $CPANSITE_LOCAL
           The location of your local CPAN archive set-up.

           Example:

             export CPANSITE_LOCAL="/www/websites/cpan.example.com"
             cpansite index

             cpansite --site $CPANSITE_LOCAL index  # alternative

       --cpan <url>  or  -c <url>  or   $CPANSITE_GLOBAL
           Update the list of "real" CPAN modules regularly (daily or more)
           from this url. By default, "ftp:///ftp.cpan.org" is addressed which
           redirects to a server close to you.

       --env-proxy
           Let LWP::UserAgent read the proxy settings from environment
           variables.  See the according method in that manual page.

       --stand-alone or  -a
           The "real" CPAN list is not included.  For instance, if you have
           downloaded all the releases from CPAN that you need, and you do not
           want unexpected extra downloads.  The downloaded versions will
           prevail over newer releases on CPAN, but you may download modules
           from the core CPAN that you do not expect.

       --no-lazy     or --lazy  or   -l
           Try to avoid redo-ing everything.  By default, the indexer is lazy:
           it will process only new distributions.  When not lazy, all
           distributions on the local disk are processed and a new table is
           created.  The default of this option was reversed with release 1.00
           of "CPAN::Site".

       --no-undefs   or --undefs or -u
           Whether to include package names with "undef" version in the
           packages list. Those packages cannot be used for dependencies, so
           are hardly useful but included by default.

DETAILS
   Configuring the Clients
       To get in touch with your own cpan archive, you have to explicitly
       provide an url to it.  Add this to your "CPAN.pm" configuration file
       (usually ~/.cpan/CPAN/MyConfig.pm) option "urllist".  There is no need
       to install the CPAN::Site software on your clients since release 1.01.

       You probably also want to set the variable "index_expire" to very
       short: the clients need to reload your local index as soon as possible,
       and not wait a day; just after your new local release is put in your
       local index, it must get visible to your client.

       You may also consider to have the CPAN install cache to be cleaned by
       the system.  Certainly when you set the cache size larger (required for
       more complex recursive installations) it is nice to have it removed
       after a (short) while.  Set "keep_source_where" to a temporary
       directory.

       Example for  ~/.cpan/CPAN/MyConfig.pm

        $CPAN::Config =
         { ...
         , index_expire      => 1/600     # 5 minutes
         , urllist => [ $MYCPAN_URL, $BIGCPAN_MIRROR ]
         , keep_source_where => '/tmp/cpan-cache'
         , build_cache       => 100       # MegaByte cache
         , ...
         };

       To avoid manually editing the CPAN config file one can also set the
       MYCPAN_URL from the shell:

         cpan> o conf urllist unshift $MYCPAN_URL
         cpan> o conf index_expire 0.001  # 86 seconds
         cpan> o conf commit

   Configuring the Server
       Starting your own CPAN

       You have to have a ftp or http server running. Create a directory where
       you will distribute the data from, here named $MYCPAN.  With a web-
       server, it is adviced to create a virtual host like "cpan.example.com"
       which has $MYCPAN as DocumentRoot.

       Define a fake pause-id (here the demo is MYID), because if you use an
       existing pause-id you clients will start producing warnings about
       missing checksums on files retreived for the public archive.

         MYMODS=$MYCPAN/authors/id/M/MY/MYID
         mkdir -p $MYMODS

       Although CPAN.pm claims to support a directory format of
       "$MYCPAN/authors/id/MYID", experience shows that this does not work
       correctly with some recursively dependencies.

       Adding your own modules to the local archive

       Put your own modules in $MYMODS and then rerun the indexer.

         mv MyDist-1.00-tar.gz $MYMODS   # local
         scp MyDist-1.00-tar.gz cpan.example.com:$MYMODS

       Generating an index with fallback

       Your own software probably depends on a lot of modules which are found
       on the global CPAN.  And those modules require even more modules from
       CPAN.  By default, your local CPAN index will know about all modules
       which you have yourself plus all module on the global CPAN.

       The index only contains the last (highest) version of each file (which
       means that each file must contain a version number otherwise the text
       "undef" is used for version)  In any case, the local packages get
       preference over the global CPAN packages, even when they have a lower
       version number.

       With fallback:

        cpansite --site $MYCPAN index
        cpansite index    # when   CPANSITE_LOCAL=$MYCPAN

       The script traverses $MYCPAN/authors/id and merges this with the
       $MYCPAN/global/02packages.details.txt.gz data, a copy from the original
       CPAN.  It creates a "CHECKSUMS" file.  The result is a private
       $MYCPAN/modules/02packages.details.txt.gz file.

       The files $MYCPAN/authors/01mailrc.txt.gz and
       $MYCPAN/modules/03modlist.data.gz are downloaded from CPAN.  This will
       reduce the number of failing retreivals when you start installing
       software.

       Be warned: the indexing scans the archive for the same VERSION patterns
       as pause does: do not make too complex expressions in those program
       lines. Only pm files are indexed, not other files, like scripts (pl
       files).

       Generating an index without fallback

       When you wish for a controled environment, where all your systems run
       the same versions of the modules, you should disable the fallback to
       the global CPAN.

       Without fallback:

        cpansite --site $MYCPAN --stand-alone index
        cpansite --stand-alone index    # when   CPANSITE_LOCAL=$MYCPAN

       The index is now very small.  But when you start installing your
       software on systems, it will start complaining that the module cannot
       be found on CPAN.  Now, add specific distribution versions from the
       global CPAN to your own archive.  See next section.

       Adding distributions from global CPAN to your own

       When you want a fixed distribution version to be used on your systems,
       you can manually download them and insert them in the $MYCPAN tree.

       However, there is also a simple way to retrieve the most recent
       version.  The next example shows how to insert the latest versions of
       the distributions which include the packages Mail::Box and Test::More
       into your local CPAN archive.

        cpansite --site $MYCPAN --cpan $GLOBAL mirror Mail::Box Test::More

        # when CPANSITE_LOCAL=$MYCPAN and CPANSITE_GLOBAL=$GLOBAL
        cpansite mirror Mail::Box Test::More
