RESCUE(8)               FreeBSD System Manager's Manual              RESCUE(8)

NAME
     rescue – rescue utilities in /rescue

DESCRIPTION
     The /rescue directory contains a collection of common utilities intended
     for use in recovering a badly damaged system.  With the transition to a
     dynamically-linked root beginning with FreeBSD 5.2, there is a real
     possibility that the standard tools in /bin and /sbin may become non-
     functional due to a failed upgrade or a disk error.  The tools in /rescue
     are statically linked and should therefore be more resistant to damage.
     However, being statically linked, the tools in /rescue are also less
     functional than the standard utilities.  In particular, they do not have
     full use of the locale, pam(3), and nsswitch libraries.

     If your system fails to boot, and it shows a prompt similar to:

           Enter full pathname of shell or RETURN for /bin/sh:

     the first thing to try running is the standard shell, /bin/sh.  If that
     fails, try running /rescue/sh, which is the rescue shell.  To repair the
     system, the root partition must first be remounted read-write.  This can
     be done with the following mount(8) command:

           /rescue/mount -uw /

     The next step is to double-check the contents of /bin, /sbin, and
     /usr/lib, possibly mounting a FreeBSD rescue or “live file system” CD-ROM
     (e.g., disc2 of the officially released FreeBSD ISO images) and copying
     files from there.  Once it is possible to successfully run /bin/sh,
     /bin/ls, and other standard utilities, try rebooting back into the
     standard system.

     The /rescue tools are compiled using crunchgen(1), which makes them
     considerably more compact than the standard utilities.  To build a
     FreeBSD system where space is critical, /rescue can be used as a
     replacement for the standard /bin and /sbin directories; simply change
     /bin and /sbin to be symbolic links pointing to /rescue.  Since /rescue
     is statically linked, it should also be possible to dispense with much of
     /usr/lib in such an environment.

     In contrast to its predecessor /stand, /rescue is updated during normal
     FreeBSD source and binary upgrades.

HISTORY
     The rescue utilities first appeared in FreeBSD 5.2.

AUTHORS
     The rescue system was written by Tim Kientzle <kientzle@FreeBSD.org>,
     based on ideas taken from NetBSD.  This manual page was written by Simon
     L. Nielsen <simon@FreeBSD.org>, based on text by Tim Kientzle

BUGS
     Most of the rescue tools work even in a fairly crippled system.  The most
     egregious exception is the rescue version of vi(1), which currently
     requires that /usr be mounted so that it can access the termcap(5) files.
     Hopefully, a failsafe termcap(3) entry will eventually be added into the
     ncurses(3) library, so that /rescue/vi can be used even in a system where
     /usr cannot immediately be mounted.  In the meantime, the rescue version
     of the ed(1) editor can be used from /rescue/ed if you need to edit
     files, but cannot mount /usr.
