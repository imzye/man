KVM_GETERR(3)          FreeBSD Library Functions Manual          KVM_GETERR(3)

NAME
     kvm_geterr – get error message on kvm descriptor

LIBRARY
     Kernel Data Access Library (libkvm, -lkvm)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <kvm.h>

     char *
     kvm_geterr(kvm_t *kd);

DESCRIPTION
     This function returns a string describing the most recent error condition
     on the descriptor kd.  The results are undefined if the most recent
     kvm(3) library call did not produce an error.  The string returned is
     stored in memory owned by kvm(3) so the message should be copied out and
     saved elsewhere if necessary.

RETURN VALUES
     The function kvm_geterr() will return "" if kd is NULL or an error has
     not been captured for kd.

SEE ALSO
     kvm(3), kvm_close(3), kvm_getargv(3), kvm_getenvv(3), kvm_getprocs(3),
     kvm_nlist(3), kvm_open(3), kvm_openfiles(3), kvm_read(3), kvm_write(3)

BUGS
     This routine cannot be used to access error conditions due to a failed
     kvm_openfiles() call, since failure is indicated by returning a NULL
     descriptor.  Therefore, errors on open are output to the special error
     buffer passed to kvm_openfiles().  This option is not available to
     kvm_open().
