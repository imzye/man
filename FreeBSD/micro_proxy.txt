NAME
       micro_proxy - really small HTTP/HTTPS proxy

SYNOPSIS
       micro_proxy

DESCRIPTION
       micro_proxy is a very small HTTP/HTTPS proxy.  It runs from inetd,
       which means its performance is poor.  But for low-traffic sites, it's
       quite adequate.  It implements all the basic features of an HTTP/HTTPS
       proxy, in only 260 lines of code.

       To install it, add a line like this to /etc/inetd.conf:
           webproxy  stream tcp nowait nobody  /usr/local/sbin/micro_proxy micro_proxy
       Make sure the path to the executable is correct.  Then add a line like
       this to /etc/services:
           webproxy   port/tcp
       Change "port" to the port number you want to use - 3128, or whatever.
       Then restart inetd by sending it a "HUP" signal, or rebooting.

       On some systems, inetd has a maximum spawn rate - if you try to run
       inetd services faster than a certain number of times per minute, it
       assumed there's either a bug of an attack going on and it shuts down
       for a few minutes.  If you run into this problem - look for syslog
       messages about too-rapid looping - you'll need to find out how to
       increase the limit.  Unfortunately this varies from OS to OS.  On
       FreeBSD, you add a "-R 10000" flag to inetd's initial command line.  On
       some Linux systems, you can set the limit on a per-service basis in
       inetd.conf, by changing "nowait" to "nowait.10000".
