CRASHINFO(8)            FreeBSD System Manager's Manual           CRASHINFO(8)

NAME
     crashinfo – analyze a core dump of the operating system

SYNOPSIS
     crashinfo [-d crashdir] [-n dumpnr] [-k kernel] [core]

DESCRIPTION
     The crashinfo utility analyzes a core dump saved by savecore(8).  It
     generates a text file containing the analysis in the same directory as
     the core dump.  For a given core dump file named vmcore.XX the generated
     text file will be named core.txt.XX.

     By default, crashinfo analyzes the most recent core dump in the core dump
     directory.  A specific core dump may be specified via either the core or
     dumpnr arguments.  Once crashinfo has located a core dump, it analyzes
     the core dump to determine the exact version of the kernel that generated
     the core.  It then looks for a matching kernel file under each of the
     subdirectories in /boot.  The location of the kernel file can also be
     explicitly provided via the kernel argument.

     Once crashinfo has located a core dump and kernel, it uses several
     utilities to analyze the core including dmesg(8), fstat(1), iostat(8),
     ipcs(1), kgdb(1), netstat(1), nfsstat(1), ps(1), pstat(8), and vmstat(8).

     The options are as follows:

     -b      Run in batch mode.  Write most messages to the core.txt.XX file
             instead of the terminal.  This flag is used when crashinfo is run
             during boot.

     -d crashdir
             Specify an alternate core dump directory.  The default crash dump
             directory is /var/crash.

     -n dumpnr
             Use the core dump saved in vmcore.dumpnr instead of the latest
             core in the core dump directory.

     -k kernel
             Specify an explicit kernel file.
