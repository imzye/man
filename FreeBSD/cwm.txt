CWM(1)                  FreeBSD General Commands Manual                 CWM(1)

NAME
     cwm – a lightweight and efficient window manager for X11

SYNOPSIS
     cwm [-nv] [-c file] [-d display]

DESCRIPTION
     cwm is a window manager for X11 which contains many features that
     concentrate on the efficiency and transparency of window management,
     while maintaining the simplest and most pleasant aesthetic.

     The options are as follows:

     -c file
             Specify an alternative configuration file.  By default, cwm loads
             ~/.cwmrc, if present.  Any error messages from lines in the
             configuration file will be sent to stderr; however, cwm will
             continue to process the rest of the configuration file.

     -d display
             Specify the display to use.

     -n      Configtest mode.  Only check the configuration file for validity.

     -v      Verbose mode.  Multiple -v options increase the verbosity.

     cwm actions are initiated either via key or mouse bindings.  The
     following notations are used throughout this page:

           C       Control key.
           M       Meta key.
           S       Shift key.
           4       Mod4 (windows) key.
           M1      Left mouse button.
           M2      Middle mouse button.
           M3      Right mouse button.

     The default key bindings are:

           CM-Return       Spawn a new terminal.
           CM-Delete       Lock the screen.
           M-Return        Hide current window.
           M-Down          Lower current window.
           M-Up            Raise current window.
           M-slash         Search for windows.
           C-slash         Search for applications.
           CM-n            Label current window.
           M-Tab           Cycle through currently visible windows.
           MS-Tab          Reverse cycle through currently visible windows.
           M-grave         Cycle through currently visible windows of the same
                           window class.
           MS-grave        Reverse cycle through currently visible windows of
                           the same window class.
           CM-x            Close current window.

           CM-a            Toggle visibility of all groups.
           CM-g            Toggle group membership of current window.
           M-Right         Cycle through active groups.
           M-Left          Reverse cycle through active groups.
           CMS-f           Toggle freezing geometry of current window.
           CM-s            Toggle stickiness of current window.

           CM-m            Toggle maximization of current window.
           CM-equal        Toggle vertical maximization of current window.
           CMS-equal       Toggle horizontal maximization of current window.
           M-[hjkl]        Move window by a small amount.
           MS-[hjkl]       Move window by a large amount; see cwmrc(5).
           CM-[hjkl]       Resize window by a small amount.
           CMS-[hjkl]      Resize window by a large amount; see cwmrc(5).
           M-question      Spawn “exec program” dialog.
           M-period        Spawn “ssh to” dialog.  This parses
                           $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts to provide host auto-
                           completion.  ssh(1) will be executed via the
                           configured terminal emulator.
           CM-w            Spawn “exec WindowManager” menu, allowing a switch
                           to another window manager.
           CMS-r           Restart.
           CMS-q           Quit.

     The default mouse bindings are:

           M-M1            Move current window.
           CM-M1           Toggle group membership of current window.
           M-M2            Resize current window
           M-M3            Lower current window.
           CMS-M3          Hide current window.

     The following key bindings may be used to navigate search and exec
     dialogs:

           [Return]              Select item.
           [Down], C-s or M-j    Next item.
           [Up], C-r or M-k      Previous item.
           [Backspace] or C-h    Backspace.
           C-u                   Clear input.
           C-a                   List all available items.
           [Esc]                 Cancel.

     cwm rereads its configuration file when it receives a hangup signal,
     SIGHUP, by executing itself with the name and arguments with which it was
     started.  This is equivalent to the restart function.

SEARCH
     cwm features the ability to search for windows by their current title,
     old titles, and by their label.  The priority for the search results are:
     label, current title, old titles in reverse order, and finally window
     class name.  cwm keeps a history of the 5 previous titles of a window.

     When searching, the leftmost character of the result list may show a
     flag:

           !       Window is currently focused.
           &       Window is hidden.

APPLICATIONS
     cwm manages a list of applications defined with the command configuration
     option.

GROUPS
     cwm has the ability to group windows together, and use the groups to
     perform operations on the entire group instead of just one window.
     Together with the sticky option, this can be used to emulate virtual
     desktops.

     To edit groups, use the group selection commands to toggle membership of
     a group.  A blue border will be shown briefly on windows added to the
     current group, and a red border will be shown on those just removed.

MENUS
     Menus are recalled by clicking the mouse on the root window:

           M1      Show list of currently defined windows.  Selecting an item
                   will warp to that window, unhiding it if necessary.
           M2      Show list of currently defined groups.  Selecting an item
                   will hide/unhide that group.
           M3      Show list of applications as defined in the configuration
                   file.  Selecting an item will spawn that application.

ENVIRONMENT
     DISPLAY     cwm starts on this display unless the -d option is given.

FILES
     ~/.cwmrc    Default cwm configuration file.

HISTORY
     cwm was originally inspired by evilwm, but was rewritten from scratch due
     to limitations in the evilwm codebase.  The from-scratch rewrite borrowed
     some code from 9wm, however that code has since been removed or
     rewritten.

     cwm first appeared in OpenBSD 4.2.
