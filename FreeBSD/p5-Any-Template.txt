NAME
       Any::Template - provide a consistent interface to a wide array of
       templating languages

SYNOPSIS
               use Any::Template;
               my $template = new Any::Template({
                       Backend => 'HTML::Template',
                       Filename => 'page.tmpl',
                       Options => {'strict' => 0}
               });
               my $output = $template->process($data);

               my $template2 = new Any::Template({
                       Backend => 'Text::Template',
                       String => $template2_content
               });
               $template->process($data, \*STDOUT);

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a simple, consistent interface to common
       templating engines so you can write code that is agnostic to the
       template language used in the presentation layer.  This means you can
       allow your interface developers to work in the templating language
       they're happiest in or write code that works with legacy/in-house
       templating modules but can also be released onto CPAN and work with
       more standard CPAN templating systems.

       By its very nature, this interface only exposes pretty much the lowest
       common denominator of the template engine APIs.  It does however
       provide a fairly rich set of input and output mechanisms, using native
       implementations where available and providing some default
       implementations to extend the default set offered by some templating
       modules.

       If you need the quirky features of a particular templating engine, then
       this may not be for you.  Having said that, in some cases you may be
       able to encapsulate some of your logic in options passed into the
       adaptor classes (either rolling your own adaptors, or improving ours)
       to pull the relevant strings on the backend module.

       Templateing languages supported by backends supplied with this
       distribution can be found in the README (remember there may be others
       out there and you can always roll your own).

METHODS
       my $template = new Any::Template(\%options);
                   See below for a list of options

       $template->process($data_structure, $sink);
                   $sink can be:
                           - a scalar ref
                           - a filename (string)
                           - a filehandle (as a glob or glob ref) or an object offering a print method
                           - a coderef (output will be passed in as the first argument)

       $string = $template->process($data_structure);
           A convenience form, if no second argument is passed to process(),
           equivalent to:

                   my $string;
                   $template->process($data_structure, \$string);

           except data is passed by value rather than by reference.

       $templating_engine = $template->native_object();
           Allows the native templating engine to be accessed.  This
           completely breaks the abstraction of Any::Template so it's not
           recommended you use it other than as a bridging strategy as part of
           a refectoring/migration process (with a view to ultimately
           eliminating its use).

SUBROUTINES
       available_backends
            $list_of_backends = Any::Template::available_backends();

           Scans @INC for a list of modules in the Any::Template::Backend::
           namespace.

ERROR HANDLING
       If an error occurs, an exception is raised with die().  You can use an
       eval block to handle the exception.  $@ will contain an error message.

CONSTRUCTOR OPTIONS
       Backend
           Backends distributed with this module are listed in the
           distribution README.

           See Any::Template::Backend for information on writing your own
           backends.  You should be able to create a new backend in a couple
           of dozen lines of code and slot it into the unit test with a one or
           2 line change.

       Filename
                   Filename of the template file

       String
                   String containing the template

       Filehandle
                   Reference to a filehandle from which to read the template

       Options
                   A hashref of options passed to the backend templating engine

ENVIRONMENT
       If you don't supply a Backend to the constructor, Any::Template looks
       for a default Backend in the ANY_TEMPLATE_DEFAULT environment variable.
       This allows you to retrofit Any::Template into legacy code without
       hard-coding a default templating language or forcing a backwardly-
       incompatible change to the interface of the code you are retrofitting
       into.

CACHING
       This module doesn't have built-in caching, however the objects it
       creates are intended to be cachable (where possible the backends hold
       onto precompiled templates that can be fed any number of data
       structures).  It's therefore up to you what caching strategy you use.
       In the spirit of "if you liked this, you might also like..."  Cache and
       Cache::Cache offer a consistent interface to a number of different
       caching strategies.
