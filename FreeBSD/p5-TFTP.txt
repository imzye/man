NAME
       TFTP - TFTP Client class

SYNOPSIS
           use TFTP;

           $tftp = new TFTP("some.host.name");
           $tftp->get("that.file");
           $tftp->octet;
           $tftp->put("this.file");
           $tftp->quit;

DESCRIPTION
       "TFTP" is a class implementing a simple TFTP client in Perl as
       described in RFC783.

OVERVIEW
       TFTP stands for Trivial File Transfer Protocol.

CONSTRUCTOR
       new (HOST [,OPTIONS])
           This is the constructor for a new TFTP object. "HOST" is the name
           of the remote host to which a TFTP connection is required.

           "OPTIONS" are passed in a hash like fashion, using key and value
           pairs.  Possible options are:

           Port - The port number to connect to on the remote machine for the
           TFTP connection

           Mode - Set the transfer mode [NETASCII, OCTET] (defaults to
           NETASCII)

           Timeout - Set the timeout value before retry (defaults to 2 sec)

           MaxTimeout - Set the maximum timeout value before retry (defaults
           to 8 sec)

           Retries - Set the number of retries (defaults to 3 with arithmetic
           backoff)

METHODS
       mode (TYPE)
           This method will set the mode to be used with the remote TFTP
           server to specify the type of data transfer. The return value is
           the previous value.

       netascii, ascii, octet, binary
           Synonyms for "mode" with the first argument set accordingly

       get ( REMOTE_FILE [, LOCAL_FILE ] )
           Get "REMOTE_FILE" from the server and store locally. "LOCAL_FILE"
           may be a filename or a filehandle. If not specified the the file
           will be stored in the current directory with the same leafname as
           the remote file.

           Returns "LOCAL_FILE", or the generated local file name if
           "LOCAL_FILE" is not given.

       put ( LOCAL_FILE [, REMOTE_FILE ] )
           Put a file on the remote server. "LOCAL_FILE" may be a name or a
           filehandle.  If "LOCAL_FILE" is a filehandle then "REMOTE_FILE"
           must be specified. If "REMOTE_FILE" is not specified then the file
           will be stored in the current directory with the same leafname as
           "LOCAL_FILE".

           Returns "REMOTE_FILE", or the generated remote filename if
           "REMOTE_FILE" is not given.

       quit
           Close the current socket and release any resources. A more complete
           way to release resources is to call 'undef $tftp;' on the session
           object.

REPORTING BUGS
       When reporting bugs/problems please include as much information as
       possible.  It may be difficult for me to reproduce the problem as
       almost every setup is different.

       A small script which yields the problem will probably be of help. It
       would also be useful if this script was run with the extra options
       "debug =" 1> passed to the constructor, and the output sent with the
       bug report. If you cannot include a small script then please include a
       Debug trace from a run of your program which does yield the problem.
