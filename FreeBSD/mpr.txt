NAME
     mpr – LSI Fusion-MPT 3/3.5 IT/IR 12Gb/s Serial Attached SCSI/SATA/PCIe

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place these lines in the kernel
     configuration file:

CONFIGURATION
     In all tunable descriptions below, X represents the adapter number.

     To disable MSI interrupts for all mpr driver instances, set this tunable
     value in loader.conf(5):

           hw.mpr.disable_msi=1

     To disable MSI interrupts for a specific mpr driver instance, set this
     tunable value in loader.conf(5):

           dev.mpr.X.disable_msi=1

     To disable MSI-X interrupts for all mpr driver instances, set this
     tunable value in loader.conf(5):

           hw.mpr.disable_msix=1

     To disable MSI-X interrupts for a specific mpr driver instance, set this
     tunable value in loader.conf(5):

           dev.mpr.X.disable_msix=1

     To set the maximum number of DMA chains allocated for all adapters, set
     this tunable in loader.conf(5):

           hw.mpr.max_chains=NNNN

     To set the maximum number of DMA chains allocated for a specific adapter,
     set this tunable in loader.conf(5):

           dev.mpr.X.max_chains=NNNN

     The default max_chains value is 16384.

     The current number of free chain frames is stored in the
     dev.mpr.X.chain_free sysctl(8) variable.

     The lowest number of free chain frames seen since boot is stored in the
     dev.mpr.X.chain_free_lowwater sysctl(8) variable.

     The number of times that chain frame allocations have failed since boot
     is stored in the dev.mpr.X.chain_alloc_fail sysctl(8) variable.  This can
     be used to determine whether the max_chains tunable should be increased
     to help performance.

     The current number of active I/O commands is shown in the
     dev.mpr.X.io_cmds_active sysctl(8) variable.

     The current number of free PRP pages is stored in the
     dev.mpr.X.prp_pages_free sysctl(8) variable.  PRP pages are used by NVMe
     devices for I/O transfers, much like Scatter/Gather lists.

     The lowest number of free PRP pages seen since boot is stored in the
     dev.mpr.X.prp_pages_free_lowwater sysctl(8) variable.

     The number of times that PRP page allocations have failed since boot is
     stored in the dev.mpr.X.prp_page_alloc_fail sysctl(8) variable.

     To set the maximum number of pages that will be used per I/O for all
     adapters, set this tunable in loader.conf(5):

           hw.mpr.max_io_pages=NNNN

     To set the maximum number of pages that will be used per I/O for a
     specific adapter, set this tunable in loader.conf(5):

           dev.mpr.X.max_io_pages=NNNN

     The default max_io_pages value is -1, meaning that the maximum I/O size
     that will be used per I/O will be calculated using the IOCFacts values
     stored in the controller.  The lowest value that the driver will use for
     max_io_pages is 1, otherwise IOCFacts will be used to calculate the
     maximum I/O size.  The smaller I/O size calculated from either
     max_io_pages or IOCFacts will be the maximum I/O size used by the driver.

     The highest number of active I/O commands seen since boot is stored in
     the dev.mpr.X.io_cmds_highwater sysctl(8) variable.

     Devices can be excluded from mpr control for all adapters by setting this
     tunable in loader.conf(5):

           hw.mpr.exclude_ids=Y

     Y represents the target ID of the device.  If more than one device is to
     be excluded, target IDs are separated by commas.

     Devices can be excluded from mpr control for a specific adapter by
     setting this tunable in loader.conf(5):

           dev.mpr.X.exclude_ids=Y

     Y represents the target ID of the device.  If more than one device is to
     be excluded, target IDs are separated by commas.

     The adapter can issue the StartStopUnit SCSI command to SATA direct-
     access devices during shutdown.  This allows the device to quiesce
     powering down.  To control this feature for all adapters, set the

           hw.mpr.enable_ssu

     tunable in loader.conf(5) to one of these values:

           0       Do not send SSU to either HDDs or SSDs.

           1       Send SSU to SSDs, but not to HDDs.  This is the default
                   value.

           2       Send SSU to HDDs, but not to SSDs.

           3       Send SSU to both HDDs and SSDs.

     To control this feature for a specific adapter, set this tunable value in
     loader.conf(5):

           dev.mpr.X.enable_ssu

     The same set of values are valid as when setting this tunable for all
     adapters.

     SATA disks that take several seconds to spin up and fail the SATA
     Identify command might not be discovered by the driver.  This problem can
     sometimes be overcome by increasing the value of the spinup wait time in
     loader.conf(5) with the

           hw.mpr.spinup_wait_time=NNNN

     tunable.  NNNN represents the number of seconds to wait for SATA devices
     to spin up when the device fails the initial SATA Identify command.

     Spinup wait times can be set for specific adapters in loader.conf(5):
     with the

           dev.mpr.X.spinup_wait_time=NNNN

     tunable.  NNNN is the number of seconds to wait for SATA devices to spin
     up when they fail the initial SATA Identify command.

     The driver can map devices discovered by the adapter so that target IDs
     corresponding to a specific device persist across resets and reboots.  In
     some cases it is possible for devices to lose their mapped IDs due to
     unexpected behavior from certain hardware, such as some types of
     enclosures.  To overcome this problem, a tunable is provided that will
     force the driver to map devices using the Phy number associated with the
     device.  This feature is not recommended if the topology includes
     multiple enclosures/expanders.  If multiple enclosures/expanders are
     present in the topology, Phy numbers are repeated, causing all devices at
     these Phy numbers except the first device to fail enumeration.  To
     control this feature for all adapters, set the

           hw.mpr.use_phy_num

     tunable in loader.conf(5) to one of these values:

           -1      Only use Phy numbers to map devices and bypass the driver's
                   mapping logic.

           0       Never use Phy numbers to map devices.

           1       Use Phy numbers to map devices, but only if the driver's
                   mapping logic fails to map the device that is being
                   enumerated.  This is the default value.

     To control this feature for a specific adapter, set this tunable value in
     loader.conf(5):

           dev.mpr.X.use_phy_num

     The same set of values are valid as when setting this tunable for all
     adapters.

DEBUGGING
     Driver diagnostic printing is controlled in loader.conf(5) by using the
     global hw.mpr.debug_level and per-device dev.mpr.X.debug_level tunables.
     One can alter the debug level for any adapter at run-time using the
     sysctl(8) variable dev.mpr.X.debug_level.

     All debug_level variables can be named by either an integer value or a
     text string.  Multiple values can be specified together by either ORing
     the integer values or by providing a comma-separated list of names.  A
     text string prefixed by "+" adds the specified debug levels to the
     existing set, while the prefix "-" removes them from the existing set.
     The current debug_level status is reported in both formats for
     convenience.  The following levels are available:

           Flag      Name        Description
           0x0001    info        Basic information (enabled by default)
           0x0002    fault       Driver faults (enabled by default)
           0x0004    event       Controller events
           0x0008    log         Logging data from controller
           0x0010    recovery    Tracing of recovery operations
           0x0020    error       Parameter errors and programming bugs
           0x0040    init        System initialization operations
           0x0080    xinfo       More detailed information
           0x0100    user        Tracing of user-generated commands (IOCTL)
           0x0200    mapping     Tracing of device mapping
           0x0400    trace       Tracing through driver functions
