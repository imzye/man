Uniq(3)               User Contributed Perl Documentation              Uniq(3)


NAME
         Uniq - Perl extension for managing list of values.

SYNOPSIS
               use Uniq;

               my @out = uniq sort @input;
               my @out = distinct sort @input;
               my @out = dups sort @input;

               Uniq exports three methods 'uniq', 'distinct' and 'dups'.
               All these methods accepts a list and returns a list.

ABSTRACT
               Similar functionality is available at shell prompts of *nix O/S.
               This modules is attempting to provide the same to Perl programming,

DESCRIPTION
               The usage of the methods provided here is simple. You always provide
               a sorted list to any of these methods and accept a sorted list of
               values in return.

               Suppose @lis1 and @list2 are two available lists defined as
               follows:

               @list_1 = qw ( first list of values );
               @list_1 = qw ( second list of values );

               and we run the following commands:

               my @output_1 = uniq sort @list1 @list2;
               my @output_2 = distinct sort @list1 @list2;
               my @output_3 = dups sort @list1 @list2;


               Now @output_1 has qw( first list of second values )
                   @output_2 has qw( first second )
               and @output_3 has qw( list of values )

               Thus @output_1 has all values from either input lists sans any
               redundant values. @output_2 has exactly those values that appear
               at most once in combined list. On the other hand @output_3 has
               a list of values that appear multiple times in input.

   EXPORT
          Exported are methods
               1) uniq       [ similar to 'uniq' shell command ]
               2) distinct   [ similar to 'uniq -u' shell command ]
               3) dups       [ similar to 'uniq -d' shell command ]

SEE ALSO
         none.
