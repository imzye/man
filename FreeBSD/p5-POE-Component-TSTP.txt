POE::Component::TSTP(3)                    User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       POE::Component::TSTP - A POE Component to handle Ctrl-Z

SYNOPSIS
         use POE;
         use POE::Component::TSTP;
         POE::Component::TSTP->create();
         # Rest of your POE program here

DESCRIPTION
       By default, POE applications do not respond to Ctrl-Z due to slightly
       strange signal handling semantics. This module fixes that.

       You can pass in two options to the create() routine:

       •   Alias

           An Alias for the component. By default it is called "tstp_handler".

       •   PreSuspend

           A subref that will be called just before suspending your program.

       •   PostSuspend

           A subref that will be called just after your program has returned
           from suspension (usually via the "fg" command).
