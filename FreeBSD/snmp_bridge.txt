SNMP_BRIDGE(3)         FreeBSD Library Functions Manual         SNMP_BRIDGE(3)

NAME
     snmp_bridge – bridge module for snmpd

LIBRARY
     (begemotSnmpdModulePath."bridge" = /usr/lib/snmp_bridge.so)

DESCRIPTION
     The snmp_bridge module implements the BRIDGE-MIB as standardized in RFC
     4188, the RSTP-MIB standardized in RFC4318 and a private BEGEMOT-BRIDGE-
     MIB, which allows management of multiple bridge interfaces.  Most of the
     objects defined in the private BEGEMOT-BRIDGE-MIB are duplicates of the
     original objects defined by the standard BRIDGE-MIB, but the private MIB
     also defines additional objects which make the functionality of
     snmp_bridge similar to ifconfig(8) for configuring bridge interfaces.
     Therefore one should consider adding write communities or loading the
     snmp_bridge module on systems where security is crucial.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
     The additional objects to configure a bridge are:

     begemotBridgeBaseStatus
                Bridge interfaces can be created and destroyed via this
                object.  SNMP SET operations with the following values are
                allowed:

                createAndWait         will attempt to create a bridge
                                      interface with the name given by the
                                      table index.

                createAndGo           will attempt to create a bridge
                                      interface with the name given by the
                                      table index and set the status of the
                                      interface to "active/up".

                destroy               will attempt to destroy the bridge
                                      interface.

     begemotBridgeBaseSpanEnabled
                A SNMP SET operation on this object is only successful if the
                corresponding port has not been added as member of the bridge
                interface on the system.

     begemotBridgeBasePortStatus
                SNMP SET operations with the following values are allowed:

                createAndWait         will create a new row for the bridge
                                      member in the SNMP
                                      begemotBridgeBasePortTable but will not
                                      try to commit the information to the
                                      system.

                active                will attempt to commit the information
                                      to the system and will be successful
                                      only if a value for
                                      begemotBridgeBaseSpanEnabled has been
                                      SET already.

                destroy               will attempt to remove the interface
                                      from the system bridge interface.

     begemotBridgeBasePortPrivate
                This object controls a bridge interface flag called PRIVATE
                where any private port can not communicate with another
                private port.

RESTRICTIONS
     Not all information in the MIBs is currently available in FreeBSD.  The
     following variables carry no information:

     dot1dBasePortCircuit

     dot1dBasePortDelayExceededDiscards

     dot1dBasePortMtuExceededDiscards

     begemotBridgeBasePortDelayExceededDiscards

     begemotBridgeBasePortMtuExceededDiscards
