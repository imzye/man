NAME
       blockrage - a falling-blocks arcade game

SYNOPSIS
       blockrage

       blockrage  [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Block Rage is a "falling-blocks" arcade game, inspired by a DOS
       classic. It features a two-player hotseat mode. In the future it should
       also feature nice graphics and sound.

GLOBAL KEYS
       Alt-Enter
              Toggle fullscreen mode

       Alt-Backslash
              Toggle doublesize mode

       PrintScreen
              Capture a screenshot to $HOME/blockrage-scr.pcx

       P      Pause the game

       Alt-X  Exit the program immediately

IN-GAME KEYS
       P      Pause the game

       Default key bindings for player 1:

       Left Arrow
              move block left

       Right Arrow
              move block right

       Up Arrow
              rotate block up

       Down Arrow
              rotate block down

       Right Shift
              drop block

       Default key bindings for player 2:

       A      move block left

       D      move block right

       W      rotate block up

       S      rotate block down

       Q      drop block


GAMEPLAY
       (Assuming you didn't change the default key settings.)  Use left/right
       arrows to move the falling piece left/right, up/down arrows to cycle
       it's tiles and right shift to make it fall faster.

       Get three same pieces in a row (horizontal/vertical/diagonal) and boom!
       they dissappear and your score increases.  You can earn even more
       points by inflicting chain reactions.  A chain reaction happens when
       some pieces explode, the ones on top of them fall, and, forming a new
       line, explode again.

2-PLAYER HOTSEAT MODE
       Default key settings for the other player are A,D (left,right) W,S
       (cycle), Q (drop).

       If you inflict a chain reaction in hotseat mode, your opponent will get
       an unpleasant surprise in the form of a row of tiles inserted to the
       bottom of his playing board.

OPTIONS
       You needn't really use them. Everything listed here can be set using
       the ingame menu.

       -p <1|2>
              sets the number of players

       +d <4|5|6>
              sets the difficulty Easy/Medium/Hard

       +l <1..10>
              sets the starting level

       +b <0,1,...>
              chooses a block set (piece graphics)

       +k1 <left> <right> <sh_up> <sh_down> <drop>

       +k2 <left> <right> <sh_up> <sh_down> <drop>
              sets player 1/2 controls you must enter five decimal numbers
              corresponding to SDLK_* keycodes e.g. +k1 276 275 303 273 274

       +data <dataset>
              chooses a dataset. the format is identical to the format of
              blockrage.cfg.  example: +data br320


THE RC FILES
       Typically you don't need to know anything about the game's RC and
       config files. They are designed so it just magically works... But if
       you are interested: the RC and config files can be of great use if you
       want to install on a multiuser system (you can customize default
       settings for the users, create a shared topten table, etc).

       When you start Block Rage, it tries to find in order:

       1. <EXECDIR>/blockrage.rc
              here <EXECDIR> is the directory where the blockrage[.exe]
              executable is situated.

       2. $HOME/.blockrage/blockrage.rc

       3. /etc/games/blockrage/blockrage.rc

       Whichever is found first is processed. That is typically (1) if the
       game is run from the source directory, or (3) if the game is run from
       the UNIX FHS filesystem. Also any user can override the system-wide
       settings by creating the file (2).

       The .rc file contains 5 lines:

       <sys-config-file>
              pathname of the system-wide config file

       <user-config-file>
              pathname of the user's config file

       <data-dir>/
              directory where the data files reside, trailed with slash

       <topten-file>
              pathname of the file where topscores are stored

       <dataset>
              name of the dataset to use (a data/ subdir)

       In the source package's src/ directory the file blockrage.rc enables
       the game to be run directly from the src/ directory. The file
       blockrage-fhs.rc is the RC file for running from the live filesystem.
       'make install' copies this file to /etc/games/blockrage/blockrage.rc.
       (3)

       After processing the .rc file, the config files are processed.

THE CONFIG FILES
       First the game tries to read the <user-config-file>. If it doesn't
       exist (meaning this user is running the game for the first time), if
       falls back to <sys-config-file>. If that cannot be found either,
       defaults are assumed.

       The config file contains the key bindings, starting level, tileset,
       etc.

ENVIRONMENT
       The HOME variable is used for ~ substitution in the RC file.

BUGS
       Might not work properly on big endian machines such as Solaris.  The
       directcolor screenshot writing is a mess. Stuck ALT key when toggling
       fullscreen or doublesize in Windows.  Switching from fullscreen to
       windowed mode fails on Windows.  Audio skew is BIG on windows.  And
       more...
