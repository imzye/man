NAME
     sscop – SSCOP transport protocol

SYNOPSIS
     sscop [-Fbefhirwx3] [-V X] [-W N] [-a p=v] [-l N] [-t t=m] [-v X]

DESCRIPTION
     The sscop tool implements the Q.2110 transport protocol.  Normally the
     program reads from standard input and sends this input over the SSCOP
     protocol on the standard output file descriptor. This means, that the
     standard output file descriptor should be connected in read-write mode.
     The program takes the following arguments:

     -F                             Use frameing on the SSCOP connection (see
                                    the -f option).

     -V X                           Set the verbose flag to the hex value X.

     -W N                           Set the initial SSCOP window to N.

     -a p=v                         Set SSCOP parameter p to the value v.  The
                                    following parameters may be set:

                                    j=N                       Set the maximum
                                                              SSCOP-UU data
                                                              size to N

                                                              SSCOP SDU data
                                                              size to N

     -w                             Don't start the SSCOP protocol. Wait for a
                                    establish indication from the remote side.

     -x                             Enable to POLL after retransmission flag.

     -3                             Send user output to file descriptor 3.

EXAMPLES
     The following command line sends the file Makefile over a pipe (this
     depends on the feature that pipes are bi-directional):

     cat Makefile | sscop -reF | sscop -weF
