Term::VT102::Boundless(3)                  User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Term::VT102::Boundless - A Term::VT102 that grows automatically to
       accomodate whatever you print to it.

SYNOPSIS
               use Term::VT102::Boundless;

               my $t = Term::VT102::Boundless->new(
                       # you can optionally specify minimal dimensions
                       cols => 80,
                       rows => 24,
               );

               $t->process($_) for @text;

               warn "screen dimensions are " . $t->cols . "x" . $t->rows;

DESCRIPTION
       This is a subclass of Term::VT102 that will grow the virtual screen to
       accomodate arbitrary width and height of text.

       The behavior is more similar to the buffer of a scrolling terminal
       emulator than to a real terminal, making it useful for output displays
       in scrolling media.

METHODS
       new Overrides "new" in Term::VT102, providing default "cols" and "rows"
           values of 1 (instead of 80 and 24).
