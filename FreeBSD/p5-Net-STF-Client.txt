NAME
       Net::STF::Bucket - A STF Bucket

SYNOPSIS
           my $client = Net::STF::Client->new( ... );
           my $bucket = Net::STF::Bucket->new(
               client => $client,
               name   => "mybucket"
           );

           $object = $bucket->put_object( $object_name, $content, \%opts );
           $object = $bucket->get_object( $object_name, \%opts );
           $bool   = $bucket->delete_object( $object_name, \%opts );
           $bool   = $bucket->delete;

DESCRIPTION
       Net::STF::Bucket allows you to work with a bucket object to manipulate
       objects.  Note that you DO NOT need to use this object if you are
       directly using the Net::STF::Client interface.
