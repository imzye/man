FWOHCI(4)              FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual              FWOHCI(4)

NAME
     fwohci – OHCI FireWire chipset device driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following line in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device firewire

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           firewire_load="YES"

     To disable physical access (see BUGS section for detail), put the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           hw.firewire.phydma_enable=0

HISTORY
     The fwohci device driver first appeared in FreeBSD 5.0.

AUTHORS
     The fwohci device driver was written by Katsushi Kobayashi and Hidetoshi
     Shimokawa.

BUGS
     The driver allows physical access from any nodes on the bus by default.
     This means that any devices on the bus can read and modify any memory
     space which can be accessed by an IEEE 1394 OHCI chip.  It is allowed
     mostly for sbp(4) devices.  This should be changed to allow it only for
     specific devices.  Anyway, FireWire is a bus and not expected to be
     connected with un-trustable devices because a node can monitor all the
     traffic.
