MLY(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 MLY(4)

NAME
     mly – Mylex AcceleRAID/eXtremeRAID family driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device pci
           device scbus
           device da
           device mly

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           mly_load="YES"

DEPRECATION NOTICE
     The mly driver is not present in FreeBSD 14.0.

DESCRIPTION
     The mly driver provides support for Mylex AcceleRAID and eXtremeRAID-
     family PCI to SCSI RAID controllers with version 6.00 and later firmware.

     Logical devices (array drives) attached to the controller are presented
     to the SCSI subsystem as though they were direct-access devices on a
     virtual SCSI bus.  Physical devices which are not claimed by a logical
     device are presented on SCSI channels which match the physical channels
     on the controller.

HARDWARE
     Controllers supported by the mly driver include:

     •   Mylex AcceleRAID 160
     •   Mylex AcceleRAID 170
     •   Mylex AcceleRAID 352
     •   Mylex eXtremeRAID 2000
     •   Mylex eXtremeRAID 3000

     Compatible Mylex controllers not listed should work, but have not been
     verified.

DIAGNOSTICS
   Controller initialisation phase
     mly%d: controller initialisation started
     mly%d: initialisation complete

     The controller firmware has started initialisation.  Normally this
     process is performed by the controller BIOS, but the driver may need to
     do this in cases where the BIOS has failed, or is not compatible (e.g. on
     non-x86 systems).

     mly%d: drive spinup in progress

     Drive startup is in progress; this may take several minutes.

     mly%d: mirror race recovery failed, one or more drives offline
     mly%d: mirror race recovery in progress
     mly%d: mirror race recovery on a critical drive

     These error codes are undocumented.

     mly%d: FATAL MEMORY PARITY ERROR

     Firmware detected a fatal memory error; the driver will not attempt to
     attach to this controller.

     mly%d: unknown initialisation code %x

     An unknown error occurred during initialisation; it will be ignored.

   Driver initialisation/shutdown phase
     mly%d: can't enable busmaster feature
     mly%d: memory window not available
     mly%d: can't allocate register window
     mly%d: can't allocate interrupt
     mly%d: can't set up interrupt

     The system's PCI BIOS has not correctly configured the controller's PCI
     interface; initialisation has failed and the driver will not attach to
     this controller.

     mly%d: can't allocate parent DMA tag
     mly%d: can't allocate buffer DMA tag
     mly%d: can't allocate command packet DMA tag
     mly%d: can't allocate scatter/gather DMA tag
     mly%d: can't allocate s/g table
     mly%d: can't allocate memory mailbox DMA tag
     mly%d: can't allocate memory mailbox

     A resource allocation error occurred while initialising the driver;
     initialisation has failed and the driver will not attach to this
     controller.

     mly%d: BTL rescan result corrupted

     The results of a scan for an attached device were corrupted.  One or more
     devices may not be correctly reported.

     mly%d: flushing cache...

     The controller cache is being flushed prior to detach or shutdown.
