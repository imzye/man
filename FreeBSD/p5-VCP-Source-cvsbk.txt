NAME
       VCP::Source::cvsbk - A CVS repository source extension for bk exported
       cvs repository

SYNOPSIS
          vcp cvsbk:/home/cvs:/module...changeset: cvsbkchangeset:

DESCRIPTION
       The source driver handles the cvs repository exported by bk. It uses
       the Logical change numbers found in the log message and the "ChangeSet"
       control file to insert source_change_id.

       This source driver is meant to use in conjunction with
       VCP::Filter::cvsbkchangeset, which has to be inserted after the
       VCP::Filter::changeset plugin

NOTES
       Revisions with message "Initial revision" are assumed empty.
