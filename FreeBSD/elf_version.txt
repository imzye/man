ELF_VERSION(3)         FreeBSD Library Functions Manual         ELF_VERSION(3)

NAME
     elf_version – retrieve or set ELF library operating version

LIBRARY
     ELF Access Library (libelf, -lelf)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <libelf.h>

     unsigned int
     elf_version(unsigned int version);

DESCRIPTION
     The elf_version() function is used to query the current operating version
     of the ELF library, and to inform the ELF library about the application's
     desired operating version.

     If the argument version is EV_NONE, the elf_version() function returns
     the currently configured operating version for the ELF library.

     If the argument version is not EV_NONE, and if argument version is
     supported by the ELF library, function elf_version() sets the library's
     operating version to version, and returns the previous value of the
     operating version.  If argument version cannot be supported, then the
     elf_version() function returns EV_NONE.

RETURN VALUES
     The elf_version() function returns the currently configured ELF library
     version, or EV_NONE if an unsupported version is requested.

EXAMPLES
     An application program would inform the ELF library about its desired
     operating version and check for an error using the following code
     snippet:

           if (elf_version(EV_CURRENT) == EV_NONE)
                   err(EXIT_FAILURE, "ELF library too old");

ERRORS
     Function elf_version() may fail with the following error:

     [ELF_E_VERSION]   An unsupported library version number was requested.
