NAME
       Makefile::AST - AST for (GNU) makefiles

DESCRIPTION
       The structure of this (GNU) makefile AST is designed based on GNU
       make's data base listing output produced by "--print-data-base".

       This AST library provides the following classes:

       Makefile::AST
           The primary class for ASTs. Provides interface for node adding and
           querying, such as "add_implicit_rule", "apply_implicit_rules",
           "add_explicit_rule", "apply_explicit_rules", "add_var",
           "add_auto_var", "get_var", as well as lots of other utility
           functions, like method "eval_var_value" for computing the ultimate
           values of makefile variables, method "enter_pad" and "leave_pad"
           for local variable's scoping pad.

       Makefile::AST::Rule::Base
           This is the base class for the rule nodes in the AST. It has
           properties like "normal_prereqs", "order_prereqs", "commands", and
           "colon".

       Makefile::AST::Rule
           This class represents the de-sugared form of simple rules and
           implicite rules after application. It inherits from
           Makefile::AST::Rule::Base, and adds new properties "target" and
           "other_targets".

       Makefile::AST::Rule::Implicit
           This class represents the implicit rule nodes in the AST. It
           inherits from Makefile::AST::Rule::Base, and adds new properties
           "targets", "match_anything", and "is_terminal".

       Makefile::AST::StemMatch
           This class encapsulates the file pattern matching (file names
           containing "%") and stem substitution algorithms.

       Makefile::AST::Variable
           It represents the makefile variable nodes in the AST, including
           "name", "value", "flavor", and "origin".

       Makefile::AST::Command
           Used to encapsulate information regarding makefile rule commands
           (e.g. command body, command modifiers "@", "-", "+", and etc.) as a
           whole.

LIMITATIONS AND TODO
       Adding support for other flavors' makes into this AST library should
       make a huge amount of sense. The most interesting candiate is
       Microsoft's NMAKE.
