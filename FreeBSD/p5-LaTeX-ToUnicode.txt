NAME
       LaTeX::ToUnicode - Convert LaTeX commands to Unicode

VERSION
       version 0.11

SYNOPSIS
         use LaTeX::ToUnicode qw( convert );

         convert( '{\"a}'           ) eq 'ä';  # true
         convert( '"a', german => 1 ) eq 'ä';  # true, `german' package syntax
         convert( '"a',             ) eq '"a';  # not enabled by default

         # more generally:
         my $latexstr;
         my $unistr = convert($latexstr);

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a method to convert LaTeX-style markups for
       accents etc.  into their Unicode equivalents. It translates commands
       for special characters or accents into their Unicode equivalents and
       removes formatting commands.  It is not at all bulletproof or complete.

       This module converts values from BibTeX files into plain text. If your
       use case is different, YMMV.

       In contrast to TeX::Encode, this module does not create HTML of any
       kind, including for HTML/XML metacharacters such as <, >, "&", which
       can appear literally in the output. Entities are other handling for
       these has to happen at another level, if need be.

FUNCTIONS
   convert( $latex_string, %options )
       Convert the text in $string that contains LaTeX into a plain(er)
       Unicode string. All escape sequences for accented and special
       characters (e.g., \i, \"a, ...) are converted. Basic formatting
       commands (e.g. {\it ...}) are removed.

       %options allows you to enable additional translations. These keys are
       recognized:

       "german"
           If this option is set, the commands introduced by the package
           `german' (e.g. ""a" eq "ä", note the missing backslash) are also
           handled.
