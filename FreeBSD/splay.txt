NAME
       splay - MPEG-1,2 Audio layer 1,2,3 file player


SYNOPSIS
       splay [-2VMfmrsv] [-k num] [-d dev] [-l list] [-t num] filenames...

       xsplay [-2Vemrsv] [-d dev] [-l list] [-t num] filenames...


DESCRIPTION
       Splay is the sound file player such as MPEG-1,2 Audio files.  And you
       can play these files using list file.  With pthread, it can play sound
       files smoother. And it has X-interface with libqt. Splay with qt may
       make you splay easily.


OPTIONS
       Splay has several options.

       -2     play MPEG-Audio files with half-frequency. If you use this
              option, you may play MPEG audio files with job which exhausts
              CPU very much.
       -e     exit when play is done. (xsplay)
       -f     display info on played and remaining frames and time.
       -m     force to mono. Play with mono even if file have stereo quality.
       -r     Repeat forever. (Not X-interface) If you -r with -s, list files
              would be shuffled everytime.
       -s     Shuffle play. If you give list file or a number of files, Splay
              will makes them rearranged randomly. And with -r Everytime the
              order of files would be changed.
       -v     Verbose, Very verbose, Very very verbose.
       -M     Play MPEG file as standard input.
       -V     Show version number.
       -t  num
              num of frames were saved during playing. When CPU is so busy and
              prevents splay from decoding, splay will play back using saved
              frames. This feature makes you do other job freely with listing
              MPEG music.
       -k  num
              num of frames are skipped at the start of playing.
       -d  dev
              Change device file. Default device file is /dev/dsp.  If you
              can't use this device file or you can output raw type data to
              file, you can use this option.  If the first character of dev is
              / , dev would be considered as device file, If the first
              character of dev is - , dev would be considered as standard
              output, otherwise dev would be considered as normal file.
       -l  list
              Select list file.  http:// can be used. (e.g.
              http://localhost/abc.m3u)
       filenames
              You can put several files, and use http:// If you use -l option,
              these will be ignored.
