NAME
       Plack::Middleware::ForceEnv - Force set environment variables for
       testing

SYNOPSIS
           # in app.psgi
           use Plack::Builder;

           builder {
               enable 'ForceEnv' =>
                   REMOTE_ADDR => "127.0.0.1",
                   REMOTE_USER => "trs";
               $app;
           };

           # with plackup
           plackup -e 'enable ForceEnv => REMOTE_USER => "trs"' app.psgi

DESCRIPTION
       ForceEnv modifies the environment passed to the application by adding
       your specified key value pairs.

       This is primarily useful when testing apps under plackup (or similar)
       in a development environment.
