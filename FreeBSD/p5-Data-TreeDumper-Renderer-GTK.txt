NAME
       Data::TreeDumper::Renderer::GTK - Gtk3::TreeView renderer for
       Data::TreeDumper

SYNOPSIS
         my $treedumper = Data::TreeDumper::Renderer::GTK->new
                               (
                               data => \%data,
                               title => 'Test Data',
                               dumper_setup => {DISPLAY_PERL_SIZE => 1}
                               );

         $treedumper->modify_font(Gtk3::Pango::FontDescription->from_string ('monospace'));
         $treedumper->expand_all;

         # some boilerplate to get the widget onto the screen...
         my $window = Gtk3::Window->new;

         my $scroller = Gtk3::ScrolledWindow->new;
         $scroller->add ($treedumper);

         $window->add ($scroller);
         $window->show_all;

DESCRIPTION
       GTK-perl renderer for Data::TreeDumper.

       This widget is the gui equivalent of Data::TreeDumper; it will display
       a perl data structure in a TreeView, allowing you to fold and unfold
       child data structures and get a quick feel for what's where.  Right-
       clicking anywhere in the view brings up a context menu, from which the
       user can choose to expand or collapse all items.

EXAMPLE
       gtk_test.pl

METHODS
       widget = Data::TreeDumper::Renderer::GTK::TreeDumper->new (...)
           Create a new TreeDumper.  The optional arguments are expect to be
           key/val pairs.

           - dumper_setup => hash reference
               All data is passed to Data::TreeDumper

           - data => scalar
               Equivalent to calling "$treedumper->set_data ($scalar)".

           - title => string or undef
               Equivalent to calling "$treedumper->set_title ($string)".

       $treedumper->set_data ($newdata)
           •   $newdata (scalar)

           Fill the tree with $newdata, which may be any scalar.  The tree
           does not reference $newdata -- necessary data is copied.

       $treedumper->set_title ($title=undef)
           •   $title (string or undef) a new title

           Set the string displayed as the column title.  The view is created
           with one column, and the header is visible only if there is a title
           set.

EXPORT
       None
