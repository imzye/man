NAME
     unix – UNIX-domain protocol family

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/un.h>

DESCRIPTION
     The UNIX-domain protocol family is a collection of protocols that
     provides local (on-machine) interprocess communication through the normal
     socket(2) mechanisms.  The UNIX-domain family supports the SOCK_STREAM,
     SOCK_SEQPACKET, and SOCK_DGRAM socket types and uses file system
     pathnames for addressing.

ADDRESSING
     UNIX-domain addresses are variable-length file system pathnames of at
     most 104 characters.  The include file <sys/un.h> defines this address:

           struct sockaddr_un {
                   u_char  sun_len;
                   u_char  sun_family;
                   char    sun_path[104];
           };

     Binding a name to a UNIX-domain socket with bind(2) causes a socket file
     to be created in the file system.  This file is not removed when the
     socket is closed — unlink(2) must be used to remove the file.

     The length of UNIX-domain address, required by bind(2) and connect(2),
     can be calculated by the macro SUN_LEN() defined in <sys/un.h>.  The
     sun_path field must be terminated by a NUL character to be used with
     SUN_LEN(), but the terminating NUL is not part of the address.

     The UNIX-domain protocol family does not support broadcast addressing or
     any form of “wildcard” matching on incoming messages.  All addresses are
     absolute- or relative-pathnames of other UNIX-domain sockets.  Normal
     file system access-control mechanisms are also applied when referencing
     pathnames; e.g., the destination of a connect(2) or sendto(2) must be
     writable.

CONTROL MESSAGES
     The UNIX-domain sockets support the communication of UNIX file
     descriptors and process credentials through the use of the msg_control
     field in the msg argument to sendmsg(2) and recvmsg(2).  The items to be
     passed are described using a struct cmsghdr that is defined in the
     include file <sys/socket.h>.

     To send file descriptors, the type of the message is SCM_RIGHTS, and the
     data portion of the messages is an array of integers representing the
     file descriptors to be passed.  The number of descriptors being passed is
     defined by the length field of the message; the length field is the sum
     of the size of the header plus the size of the array of file descriptors.

     The received descriptor is a duplicate of the sender's descriptor, as if
     it were created via dup(fd) or fcntl(fd, F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC, 0) depending on
     whether MSG_CMSG_CLOEXEC is passed in the recvmsg(2) call.  Descriptors
     that are awaiting delivery, or that are purposely not received, are
     automatically closed by the system when the destination socket is closed.

     Credentials of the sending process can be transmitted explicitly using a
     control message of type SCM_CREDS with a data portion of type struct
     cmsgcred, defined in <sys/socket.h> as follows:

     struct cmsgcred {
       pid_t cmcred_pid;             /* PID of sending process */
       uid_t cmcred_uid;             /* real UID of sending process */
       uid_t cmcred_euid;            /* effective UID of sending process */
       gid_t cmcred_gid;             /* real GID of sending process */
       short cmcred_ngroups;         /* number of groups */
       gid_t cmcred_groups[CMGROUP_MAX];     /* groups */
     };

     The sender should pass a zeroed buffer which will be filled in by the
     system.

     The group list is truncated to at most CMGROUP_MAX GIDs.

     The process ID cmcred_pid should not be looked up (such as via the
     KERN_PROC_PID sysctl) for making security decisions.  The sending process
     could have exited and its process ID already been reused for a new
     process.

SOCKET OPTIONS
     UNIX domain sockets support a number of socket options for the options
     level SOL_LOCAL, which can be set with setsockopt(2) and tested with
     getsockopt(2):

     LOCAL_CREDS                 This option may be enabled on SOCK_DGRAM,
                                 SOCK_SEQPACKET, or a SOCK_STREAM socket.
                                 This option provides a mechanism for the
                                 receiver to receive the credentials of the
                                 process calling write(2), send(2), sendto(2)
                                 or sendmsg(2) as a recvmsg(2) control
                                 message.  The msg_control field in the msghdr
                                 structure points to a buffer that contains a
                                 cmsghdr structure followed by a variable
                                 length sockcred structure, defined in
                                 <sys/socket.h> as follows:

                                 struct sockcred {
                                   uid_t sc_uid;         /* real user id */
                                   uid_t sc_euid;        /* effective user id */
                                   gid_t sc_gid;         /* real group id */
                                   gid_t sc_egid;        /* effective group id */
                                   int   sc_ngroups;     /* number of supplemental groups */
                                   gid_t sc_groups[1];   /* variable length */
                                 };

                                 The current implementation truncates the
                                 group list to at most CMGROUP_MAX groups.

                                 The SOCKCREDSIZE() macro computes the size of
                                 the sockcred structure for a specified number
                                 of groups.  The cmsghdr fields have the
                                 following values:

                                 cmsg_len = CMSG_LEN(SOCKCREDSIZE(ngroups))
                                 cmsg_level = SOL_SOCKET
                                 cmsg_type = SCM_CREDS

                                 On SOCK_STREAM and SOCK_SEQPACKET sockets
                                 credentials are passed only on the first read
                                 from a socket, then the system clears the
                                 option on the socket.

                                 This option and the above explicit struct
                                 cmsgcred both use the same value SCM_CREDS
                                 but incompatible control messages.  If this
                                 option is enabled and the sender attached a
                                 SCM_CREDS control message with a struct
                                 cmsgcred, it will be discarded and a struct
                                 sockcred will be included.

                                 Many setuid programs will write(2) data at
                                 least partially controlled by the invoker,
                                 such as error messages.  Therefore, a message
                                 accompanied by a particular sc_euid value
                                 should not be trusted as being from that
                                 user.

     LOCAL_CREDS_PERSISTENT      This option is similar to LOCAL_CREDS, except
                                 that socket credentials are passed on every
                                 read from a SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_SEQPACKET
                                 socket, instead of just the first read.
                                 Additionally, the msg_control field in the
                                 msghdr structure points to a buffer that
                                 contains a cmsghdr structure followed by a
                                 variable length sockcred2 structure, defined
                                 in <sys/socket.h> as follows:

                                 struct sockcred2 {
                                   int   sc_version;     /* version of this structure */
                                   pid_t sc_pid;         /* PID of sending process */
                                   uid_t sc_uid;         /* real user id */
                                   uid_t sc_euid;        /* effective user id */
                                   gid_t sc_gid;         /* real group id */
                                   gid_t sc_egid;        /* effective group id */
                                   int   sc_ngroups;     /* number of supplemental groups */
                                   gid_t sc_groups[1];   /* variable length */
                                 };

                                 The current version is zero.

                                 The cmsghdr fields have the following values:

                                 cmsg_len = CMSG_LEN(SOCKCRED2SIZE(ngroups))
                                 cmsg_level = SOL_SOCKET
                                 cmsg_type = SCM_CREDS2

                                 The LOCAL_CREDS and LOCAL_CREDS_PERSISTENT
                                 options are mutually exclusive.

     LOCAL_CONNWAIT              Used with SOCK_STREAM sockets, this option
                                 causes the connect(2) function to block until
                                 accept(2) has been called on the listening
                                 socket.

     LOCAL_PEERCRED              Requested via getsockopt(2) on a SOCK_STREAM
                                 or SOCK_SEQPACKET socket returns credentials
                                 of the remote side.  These will arrive in the
                                 form of a filled in xucred structure, defined
                                 in <sys/ucred.h> as follows:

                                 struct xucred {
                                   u_int cr_version;             /* structure layout version */
                                   uid_t cr_uid;                 /* effective user id */
                                   short cr_ngroups;             /* number of groups */
                                   gid_t cr_groups[XU_NGROUPS];  /* groups */
                                   pid_t cr_pid;                 /* process id of the sending process */
                                 };
                                 The cr_version fields should be checked
                                 against XUCRED_VERSION define.

                                 The credentials presented to the server (the
                                 listen(2) caller) are those of the client
                                 when it called connect(2); the credentials
                                 presented to the client (the connect(2)
                                 caller) are those of the server when it
                                 called listen(2).  This mechanism is
                                 reliable; there is no way for either party to
                                 influence the credentials presented to its
                                 peer except by calling the appropriate system
                                 call (e.g., connect(2) or listen(2)) under
                                 different effective credentials.

                                 To reliably obtain peer credentials on a
                                 SOCK_DGRAM socket refer to the LOCAL_CREDS
                                 socket option.
