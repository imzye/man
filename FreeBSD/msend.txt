Introduction
       The msend project was flaring until 1993. In 1993 the next version of
       msend just didn't get released. I don't quite know why, but it's my
       duty to the UNIX community to continue this project and make sure it
       becomes the number one message daemon around (if not the only?!).

       This new version of msend marks many little cleanups, and fixes, mostly
       to the actual user interface of the program. However, in sense it marks
       more than that. It marks a continuation of a great project! The next
       version will include support for encrypted message transmission, file
       transmission via TCP and a new message forwarding daemon which will e-
       mail you any new messages while you are away. You will also have the
       option to spawn another editor (like pico/vi/emacs) to edit the
       message, rather than do it on a line by line basis. I'm considering
       adding a simple user interface, to let learning users use the msend
       program (without spoiling it for others).

       The easiest way to get to know msend is to try chatting with other
       people with it, either locally or remotely, to get a feel for the
       program. I'm sure you'll be impressed. If you have any suggestions for
       the future release of msend, please e-mail me. My address is at the
       bottom of this manual page. I also hope to keep this manual page up to
       date. I'll leave it virtually as is (with a few minor modifications)
       below, until the next release. If you want a more up to date resource,
       read the README file.  Hopefully the administrator has read the
       instructions and installed it into /usr/doc/msend.

Description
       This program can be used to send messages to people on either the local
       machine or on remote machines where the RFC1312 Message Send Protocol
       is supported.

       To send a message to someone you would commonly use the form:

       msend recipient

       Msend will then go into an message input mode where you enter a message
       line-by-line. You can complete the message by entering a blank line or
       sending the end-of-file character.

       If the person you have sent the message to is not logged on or has used
       mesg n to turn their messages off, the message to them may be saved for
       them to read when they next log in. In fact all messages that are
       received are saved so that you can review them at leisure. The msend
       -c, msend -l and msend -u options select these features and are
       described in greater detail later.

       In the example shown above, recipient is usually one of the following
       forms:

            fred                Sends to user "fred" on the same machine.

            fred@bitty.box      Sends to fred on the machine "bitty.box".

            fred:tty00          Sends to fred on terminal tty00.

            :all@bitty.box      Sends to all terminals on bitty.box.

            @bitty.box          Sends to the console at bitty.box.

       Strictly speaking, the form of the recipient string is:

       [user][:tty][@host]

       If either the user or the tty is omitted the program will attempt to
       match on the other. If both are omitted the message will be sent to the
       console or some other default destination. If the tty is given as "all"
       the message will be sent to all of user's logins. If user isn't
       specified it will be sent to all users on the machine.

       If the host is not specified, the message will be delivered to the
       local host.  Otherwise it will be sent to the specified machine. This
       field is ignored if the -b flag is given.

Usage
       msend [-t] [-g] [-b] [-v] [-rN] [-pN] [-d] recipient [message]

       This form is used to send messages. A message may either be given on
       the command line or if omitted there will be taken from standard input.

       msend -l[N]

       Display the last N messages. This is particularly useful if a message
       was lost from your screen before you had a chance to read it. Usually
       only a maximum of twenty messages are kept between logins. Regular
       cleanups will delete old messages as well.

       msend -c

       Check unread messages. If a message is sent to a user who is not logged
       on it will be stored in their save file and marked as unread.  Placing
       an msend -c command in your .login file will inform you of any unread
       messages when you log in next. The program will return 0 if there are
       messages or 1 if there are none.

       msend -u

       Display unread messages. This will display all messages received while
       you were incommunicado.

       msend -s[N]

       Shorten your buffer of old messages. The number of messages left in
       your buffer is reduced to at most N. You may want to put this in your
       .logout file to prevent keeping ancient messages. If neither this
       function nor msend -e is ever executed the message buffer will grow
       forever, which is considered a Bad Thing.

       msend -e[N]

       Expire old messages. This goes through all the users on the system and
       reduces the maximum number of saved messages to N. The default is
       twenty. Only the system administrator can run this function. Often this
       is run as a daily cron(8) job.

Options
       -t     This enables the use of TCP (stream) connections rather than
              datagrams.  Using streams connections means that messages will
              have no size limit and will be reliable over bad network
              connections. On the other hand transmission is a little more
              inefficient and takes longer.

       -g     Enables UDP (datagram) transmission. This is the default.
              Datagram connections are slightly faster but are less reliable
              on unreliable network links. They are also limited to 64k in
              size.

       -b     Switches to broadcast transmission. This will cause the message
              to be seen by all machines on the local network. If none of the
              machines is able to deliver it directly to the destination the
              attempt will timeout and you will receive a "Message
              unacknowledged - may not have been received" error. Broadcast
              messages are also limited to 1k.

       -v     Turns on verbose mode. This tells you various details of the
              progress of transmission.

       -rN    Selects a number of retransmission attempts. The default is
              four.  The first retransmission occurs after three seconds. This
              period between retransmissions increases by two seconds each
              time.

       -pN    Sets the internet port number to use. Normally the default port
              ⅛ will be used.

       -d     Turns on debugging mode. This will display a lot of boring
              information.

Environment Variables
