NAME
       Mojolicious::Plugin::OpenAPI::Guides::OpenAPIv3 - Mojolicious <3
       OpenAPI v3

OVERVIEW
       This guide will give you an introduction on how to use
       Mojolicious::Plugin::OpenAPI with OpenAPI version v3.x.

TUTORIAL
   Specification
       This plugin reads an OpenAPI specification
       <https://openapis.org/specification> and generates routes and
       input/output rules from it. See JSON::Validator for supported schema
       file formats.

                 ],
                 "requestBody": {
                   "content": {
                     "application/json": {
                       "schema": {

                     "description": "Pet response",
                     "content": {
                       "application/json": {
                         "schema": {
                           "type": "object",
                           "properties": {
                             "pets": {
                               "type": "array",
                               "items": {
                                 "type": "object"
                               }
                             }
                           }
                         }
                       }
                     }
                   }
                 }
               }
             }
           },
           "servers": [
             {
               "url": "/api"
             }
           ]
         }

       The complete HTTP request for getting the "pet list" will be "GET
       /api/pets" The first part of the path ("/api") comes from "servers",
       the second part comes from the keys under "paths", and the HTTP method
       comes from the keys under "/pets".

       The different parts of the specification can also be retrieved as JSON
       using the "OPTIONS" HTTP method. Example:

         OPTIONS /api/pets
         OPTIONS /api/pets?method=get

       Note that the use of "OPTIONS" is EXPERIMENTAL, and subject to change.

       Here are some more details about the different keys:

       • openapi, info and paths

         These three sections are required to make the specification valid.
         Check out
         <https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md>
         for a complete reference to the specification.

       • parameters, requestBody and responses

         "parameters", "requestBody" and "responses" will be used to define
         input and output validation rules, which is used by "openapi.input"
         in Mojolicious::Plugin::OpenAPI and when rendering the response back
         to the client, using "render(openapi => ...)".

         Here OpenAPIv3 input differs from the v2 spec, where "parameters" is
         used for input in the path or query of the request. The "requestBody"
         is used for input passed in the body.

         Have a look at "RENDERER" in Mojolicious::Plugin::OpenAPI for more
         details about output rendering.

       • operationId and x-mojo-name

         See "Route names".

       • x-mojo-placeholder

         "x-mojo-placeholder" can be used inside a parameter definition to
         instruct Mojolicious to parse a path part in a certain way. Example:

           "parameters": [
             {
               "x-mojo-placeholder": "#",
               "in": "path",
               "name": "email",
               "type": "string"
             }
           ]

         See Mojolicious::Guides::Routing for more information about
         "standard", "relaxed" and "wildcard" placeholders. The default is to
         use the "standard" ("/:foo") placeholder.

       • x-mojo-to

         The non-standard part in the spec above is "x-mojo-to". The "x-mojo-
         to" key can be either a plain string, object (hash) or an array. The
         string and hash will be passed directly to "to" in
         Mojolicious::Routes::Route, while the array ref will be flattened.
         Examples:

           "x-mojo-to": "pet#list"
           $route->to("pet#list");

           "x-mojo-to": {"controller": "pet", "action": "list", "foo": 123}
           $route->to({controller => "pet", action => "list", foo => 123);

           "x-mojo-to": ["pet#list", {"foo": 123}, ["format": ["json"]]]
           $route->to("pet#list", {foo => 123});
           $route->pattern->constraints->{format} = ["json"];

       • security and securitySchemes

         The securityScheme is added under components, where one way is to
         have the client place an apiKey in the header of the request

           {
             ...
             "components": {
               "securitySchemes": {
                 "apiKey": {
                   "name": "X-Api-Key",
                   "in": "header",
                   "type": "apiKey"
                 }
               }
             }
           }

         It is then referenced under the path object as security like this

           {
             ...
             "paths": {
               "/pets": {
                 "get": {
                   "operationId": "getPets",
                   ...
                   "security": [
                     {
                       "apiKey": []
                     }
                   ]
                 }
               }
             }
           }

         You can then utilize security, by adding a security callback when
         loading the plugin

           $self->plugin(
             OpenAPI => {
               spec     => $self->static->file("openapi.json")->path,
               security => {
                 apiKey => sub {
                   my ($c, $definition, $scopes, $cb) = @_;
                   if (my $key = $c->tx->req->content->headers->header('X-Api-Key')) {
                     if (got_valid_api_key()) {
                       return $c->$cb();
                     }
                     else {
                       return $c->$cb('Api Key not valid');
                     }
                   }
                   else {
                     return $c->$cb('Api Key header not present');
                   }
                 }
               }
             }
           );

       References with files

       Only a file reference like

         "$ref": "my-other-cool-component.json#/components/schemas/inputSchema"

       Is supported, though a valid path must be used for both the reference
       and in the referenced file, in order to produce a valid spec output.

       See "File references" in Known Issues for unsupported file references

   Application
         package Myapp;
         use Mojo::Base "Mojolicious";

         sub startup {
           my $app = shift;
           $app->plugin("OpenAPI" => {url => $app->home->rel_file("myapi.json")});
         }

         1;

       The first thing in your code that you need to do is to load this plugin
       and the "Specification". See "register" in Mojolicious::Plugin::OpenAPI
       for information about what the plugin config can be.

       See also "SYNOPSIS" in Mojolicious::Plugin::OpenAPI for example
       Mojolicious::Lite application.

   Controller
         package Myapp::Controller::Pet;
         use Mojo::Base "Mojolicious::Controller";

         sub list {

           # Do not continue on invalid input and render a default 400
           # error document.
           my $c = shift->openapi->valid_input or return;

           # You might want to introspect the specification for the current route
           my $spec = $c->openapi->spec;
           unless ($spec->{'x-opening-hour'} == (localtime)[2]) {
             return $c->render(openapi => [], status => 498);
           }

           my $age  = $c->param("age");
           my $body = $c->req->json;

           # $output will be validated by the OpenAPI spec before rendered
           my $output = {pets => [{name => "kit-e-cat"}]};
           $c->render(openapi => $output);
         }

         1;

       The input will be validated using "openapi.valid_input" in
       Mojolicious::Plugin::OpenAPI while the output is validated through then
       openapi handler.

   Route names
       Routes will get its name from either "x-mojo-name" or from
       "operationId" if defined in the specification.

       The route name can also be used the other way around, to find already
       defined routes. This is especially useful for Mojolicious::Lite apps.

       Note that if spec_route_name is used then all the route names will have
       that value as prefix:

         spec_route_name            = "my_cool_api"
         operationId or x-mojo-name = "Foo"
         Route name                 = "my_cool_api.Foo"

       You can also set "x-mojo-name" in the spec, instead of passing
       spec_route_name to plugin():

         {
           "openapi": "3.0.2",
           "info": { "version": "1.0", "title": "Some awesome API" },
           "x-mojo-name": "my_cool_api"
         }

   Default response schema
       A default response definition will be added to the API spec, unless
       it's already defined. This schema will at least be used for invalid
       input (400 - Bad Request) and invalid output (500 - Internal Server
       Error), but can also be used in other cases.

       See "default_response_codes" in Mojolicious::Plugin::OpenAPI and
       "default_response_name" in Mojolicious::Plugin::OpenAPI for more
       details on how to configure these settings.

       The response schema will be added to your spec like this, unless
       already defined:

         {
           ...
           "components": {
             ...
             "schemas": {
               ...
               "DefaultResponse": {
                 "type":     "object",
                 "required": ["errors"],
                 "properties": {
                   "errors": {
                     "type":  "array",
                     "items": {
                       "type":       "object",
                       "required":   ["message"],
                       "properties": {"message": {"type": "string"}, "path": {"type": "string"}}
                     }
                   }
                 }
               }
             }
           }
         }

       The "errors" key will contain one element for all the invalid data, and
       not just the first one. The useful part for a client is mostly the
       "path", while the "message" is just to add some human readable debug
       information for why this request/response failed.

   Rendering binary data
       Rendering assets and binary data should be accomplished by using the
       standard Mojolicious tools:

         sub get_image {
           my $c = shift->openapi->valid_input or return;
           my $asset = Mojo::Asset::File->new(path => "image.jpeg");

           $c->res->headers->content_type("image/jpeg");
           $c->reply->asset($asset);
         }

OpenAPIv2 to OpenAPIv3 conversion
       Both online and offline tools are available. One example is of this is
       <https://github.com/mermade/openapi-webconverter>

Known issues
   File references
       Relative file references like the following

         "$ref": "my-cool-component.json#"
         "$ref": "my-cool-component.json"

       Will also be placed under '#/definitions/...', again producing a spec
       output which will not pass validation.
