NAME
       zstd - zstd, zstdmt, unzstd, zstdcat - Compress or decompress .zst
       files

SYNOPSIS
       zstd [OPTIONS] [-|INPUT-FILE] [-o OUTPUT-FILE]

       zstdmt is equivalent to zstd -T0

       unzstd is equivalent to zstd -d

       zstdcat is equivalent to zstd -dcf

DESCRIPTION
       zstd is a fast lossless compression algorithm and data compression
       tool, with command line syntax similar to gzip (1) and xz (1). It is
       based on the LZ77 family, with further FSE & huff0 entropy stages. zstd
       offers highly configurable compression speed, with fast modes at > 200
       MB/s per code, and strong modes nearing lzma compression ratios. It
       also features a very fast decoder, with speeds > 500 MB/s per core.

       zstd command line syntax is generally similar to gzip, but features the
       following differences :

       •   Source files are preserved by default. It´s possible to remove them
           automatically by using the --rm command.

       •   When compressing a single file, zstd displays progress
           notifications and result summary by default. Use -q to turn them
           off.

       •   zstd does not accept input from console, but it properly accepts
           stdin when it´s not the console.

       •   zstd displays a short help page when command line is an error. Use
           -q to turn it off.




       zstd compresses or decompresses each file according to the selected
       operation mode. If no files are given or file is -, zstd reads from
       standard input and writes the processed data to standard output. zstd
       will refuse to write compressed data to standard output if it is a
       terminal : it will display an error message and skip the file.
       Similarly, zstd will refuse to read compressed data from standard input
       if it is a terminal.

       Unless --stdout or -o is specified, files are written to a new file
       whose name is derived from the source file name:

       •   When compressing, the suffix .zst is appended to the source
           filename to get the target filename.

       •   When decompressing, the .zst suffix is removed from the source
           filename to get the target filename




   Concatenation with .zst files
       It is possible to concatenate .zst files as is. zstd will decompress
       such files as if they were a single .zst file.

OPTIONS
   Integer suffixes and special values
       In most places where an integer argument is expected, an optional
       suffix is supported to easily indicate large integers. There must be no
       space between the integer and the suffix.

       KiB    Multiply the integer by 1,024 (2^10). Ki, K, and KB are accepted
              as synonyms for KiB.

       MiB    Multiply the integer by 1,048,576 (2^20). Mi, M, and MB are
              accepted as synonyms for MiB.

   Operation mode
       If multiple operation mode options are given, the last one takes
       effect.

       -z, --compress
              Compress. This is the default operation mode when no operation
              mode option is specified and no other operation mode is implied
              from the command name (for example, unzstd implies
              --decompress).

       -d, --decompress, --uncompress
              Decompress.

       -t, --test
              Test the integrity of compressed files. This option is
              equivalent to --decompress --stdout except that the decompressed
              data is discarded instead of being written to standard output.
              No files are created or removed.

       -b#    Benchmark file(s) using compression level #

       --train FILEs
              Use FILEs as a training set to create a dictionary. The training
              set should contain a lot of small files (> 100).

       -l, --list
              Display information related to a zstd compressed file, such as
              size, ratio, and checksum. Some of these fields may not be
              available. This command can be augmented with the -v modifier.

   Operation modifiers
       -#     # compression level [1-19] (default: 3)

       --ultra
              unlocks high compression levels 20+ (maximum 22), using a lot
              more memory. Note that decompression will also require more
              memory when using these levels.

       --long[=#]
              enables long distance matching with # windowLog, if not # is not
              present it defaults to 27. This increases the window size
              (windowLog) and memory usage for both the compressor and
              decompressor. This setting is designed to improve the
              compression ratio for files with long matches at a large
              distance.

              Note: If windowLog is set to larger than 27, --long=windowLog or
              --memory=windowSize needs to be passed to the decompressor.

       -T#, --threads=#
              Compress using # threads (default: 1). If # is 0, attempt to
              detect and use the number of physical CPU cores. In all cases,
              the nb of threads is capped to ZSTDMT_NBTHREADS_MAX==256. This
              modifier does nothing if zstd is compiled without multithread
              support.

       -D file
              use file as Dictionary to compress or decompress FILE(s)

       --nodictID
              do not store dictionary ID within frame header (dictionary
              compression). The decoder will have to rely on implicit
              knowledge about which dictionary to use, it won´t be able to
              check if it´s correct.

       -o file
              save result into file (only possible with a single INPUT-FILE)

       -f, --force
              overwrite output without prompting, and (de)compress symbolic
              links

       -c, --stdout
              force write to standard output, even if it is the console

       --[no-]sparse
              enable / disable sparse FS support, to make files with many
              zeroes smaller on disk. Creating sparse files may save disk
              space and speed up decompression by reducing the amount of disk
              I/O. default: enabled when output is into a file, and disabled
              when output is stdout. This setting overrides default and can
              force sparse mode over stdout.

       --rm   remove source file(s) after successful compression or
              decompression

       -k, --keep
              keep source file(s) after successful compression or
              decompression. This is the default behavior.

       -r     operate recursively on dictionaries

       --format=FORMAT
              compress and decompress in other formats. If compiled with
              support, zstd can compress to or decompress from other
              compression algorithm formats. Possibly available options are
              gzip, xz, lzma, and lz4.

       -h/-H, --help
              display help/long help and exit

       -V, --version
              display version number and exit. Advanced : -vV also displays
              supported formats. -vvV also displays POSIX support.

       -v     verbose mode

       -q, --quiet
              suppress warnings, interactivity, and notifications. specify
              twice to suppress errors too.

       -C, --[no-]check
              add integrity check computed from uncompressed data (default:
              enabled)

       --     All arguments after -- are treated as files

DICTIONARY BUILDER
       zstd offers dictionary compression, which greatly improves efficiency
       on small files and messages. It´s possible to train zstd with a set of
       samples, the result of which is saved into a file called a dictionary.
       Then during compression and decompression, reference the same
       dictionary, using command -D dictionaryFileName. Compression of small
       files similar to the sample set will be greatly improved.

       --train FILEs
              Use FILEs as training set to create a dictionary. The training
              set should contain a lot of small files (> 100), and weight
              typically 100x the target dictionary size (for example, 10 MB
              for a 100 KB dictionary).

              Supports multithreading if zstd is compiled with threading
              support. Additional parameters can be specified with
              --train-cover. The legacy dictionary builder can be accessed
              with --train-legacy. Equivalent to --train-cover=d=8,steps=4.

       -o file
              Dictionary saved into file (default name: dictionary).

       --maxdict=#
              Limit dictionary to specified size (default: 112640).

       -#     Use # compression level during training (optional). Will
              generate statistics more tuned for selected compression level,
              resulting in a small compression ratio improvement for this
              level.

       -B#    Split input files in blocks of size # (default: no split)

       --dictID=#
              A dictionary ID is a locally unique ID that a decoder can use to
              verify it is using the right dictionary. By default, zstd will
              create a 4-bytes random number ID. It´s possible to give a
              precise number instead. Short numbers have an advantage : an ID
              < 256 will only need 1 byte in the compressed frame header, and
              an ID < 65536 will only need 2 bytes. This compares favorably to
              4 bytes default. However, it´s up to the dictionary manager to
              not assign twice the same ID to 2 different dictionaries.

       --train-cover[=k#,d=#,steps=#]
              Select parameters for the default dictionary builder algorithm
              named cover. If d is not specified, then it tries d = 6 and d =
              8. If k is not specified, then it tries steps values in the
              range [50, 2000]. If steps is not specified, then the default
              value of 40 is used. Requires that d <= k.

              Selects segments of size k with highest score to put in the
              dictionary. The score of a segment is computed by the sum of the
              frequencies of all the subsegments of size d. Generally d should
              be in the range [6, 8], occasionally up to 16, but the algorithm
              will run faster with d <= 8. Good values for k vary widely based
              on the input data, but a safe range is [2 * d, 2000]. Supports
              multithreading if zstd is compiled with threading support.

              Examples:

              zstd --train-cover FILEs

              zstd --train-cover=k=50,d=8 FILEs

              zstd --train-cover=d=8,steps=500 FILEs

              zstd --train-cover=k=50 FILEs

       --train-legacy[=selectivity=#]
              Use legacy dictionary builder algorithm with the given
              dictionary selectivity (default: 9). The smaller the selectivity
              value, the denser the dictionary, improving its efficiency but
              reducing its possible maximum size. --train-legacy=s=# is also
              accepted.

              Examples:

              zstd --train-legacy FILEs

              zstd --train-legacy=selectivity=8 FILEs

BENCHMARK
       -b#    benchmark file(s) using compression level #

       -e#    benchmark file(s) using multiple compression levels, from -b# to
              -e# (inclusive)

       -i#    minimum evaluation time, in seconds (default: 3s), benchmark
              mode only

       -B#, --block-size=#
              cut file(s) into independent blocks of size # (default: no
              block)

       --priority=rt
              set process priority to real-time

       Output Format: CompressionLevel#Filename : IntputSize -> OutputSize
       (CompressionRatio), CompressionSpeed, DecompressionSpeed

       Methodology: For both compression and decompression speed, the entire
       input is compressed/decompressed in-memory to measure speed. A run
       lasts at least 1 sec, so when files are small, they are
       compressed/decompressed several times per run, in order to improve
       measurement accuracy.

ADVANCED COMPRESSION OPTIONS
   --zstd[=options]:
       zstd provides 22 predefined compression levels. The selected or default
       predefined compression level can be changed with advanced compression
       options. The options are provided as a comma-separated list. You may
       specify only the options you want to change and the rest will be taken
       from the selected or default compression level. The list of available
       options:

       strategy=strat, strat=strat
              Specify a strategy used by a match finder.

              There are 8 strategies numbered from 1 to 8, from faster to
              stronger: 1=ZSTD_fast, 2=ZSTD_dfast, 3=ZSTD_greedy, 4=ZSTD_lazy,
              5=ZSTD_lazy2, 6=ZSTD_btlazy2, 7=ZSTD_btopt, 8=ZSTD_btultra.

       windowLog=wlog, wlog=wlog
              Specify the maximum number of bits for a match distance.

              The higher number of increases the chance to find a match which
              usually improves compression ratio. It also increases memory
              requirements for the compressor and decompressor. The minimum
              wlog is 10 (1 KiB) and the maximum is 30 (1 GiB) on 32-bit
              platforms and 31 (2 GiB) on 64-bit platforms.

              Note: If windowLog is set to larger than 27, --long=windowLog or
              --memory=windowSize needs to be passed to the decompressor.

       hashLog=hlog, hlog=hlog
              Specify the maximum number of bits for a hash table.

              Bigger hash tables cause less collisions which usually makes
              compression faster, but requires more memory during compression.

              The minimum hlog is 6 (64 B) and the maximum is 26 (128 MiB).

       chainLog=clog, clog=clog
              Specify the maximum number of bits for a hash chain or a binary
              tree.

              Higher numbers of bits increases the chance to find a match
              which usually improves compression ratio. It also slows down
              compression speed and increases memory requirements for
              compression. This option is ignored for the ZSTD_fast strategy.

              The minimum clog is 6 (64 B) and the maximum is 28 (256 MiB).

       searchLog=slog, slog=slog
              Specify the maximum number of searches in a hash chain or a
              binary tree using logarithmic scale.

              More searches increases the chance to find a match which usually
              increases compression ratio but decreases compression speed.

              The minimum slog is 1 and the maximum is 26.

       searchLength=slen, slen=slen
              Specify the minimum searched length of a match in a hash table.

              Larger search lengths usually decrease compression ratio but
              improve decompression speed.

              The minimum slen is 3 and the maximum is 7.

       targetLen=tlen, tlen=tlen
              Specify the minimum match length that causes a match finder to
              stop searching for better matches.

              A larger minimum match length usually improves compression ratio
              but decreases compression speed. This option is only used with
              strategies ZSTD_btopt and ZSTD_btultra.

              The minimum tlen is 4 and the maximum is 999.

       overlapLog=ovlog, ovlog=ovlog
              Determine overlapSize, amount of data reloaded from previous
              job. This parameter is only available when multithreading is
              enabled. Reloading more data improves compression ratio, but
              decreases speed.

              The minimum ovlog is 0, and the maximum is 9. 0 means "no
              overlap", hence completely independent jobs. 9 means "full
              overlap", meaning up to windowSize is reloaded from previous
              job. Reducing ovlog by 1 reduces the amount of reload by a
              factor 2. Default ovlog is 6, which means "reload windowSize /
              8". Exception : the maximum compression level (22) has a default
              ovlog of 9.

       ldmHashLog=ldmhlog, ldmhlog=ldmhlog
              Specify the maximum size for a hash table used for long distance
              matching.

              This option is ignored unless long distance matching is enabled.

              Bigger hash tables usually improve compression ratio at the
              expense of more memory during compression and a decrease in
              compression speed.

              The minimum ldmhlog is 6 and the maximum is 26 (default: 20).

       ldmSearchLength=ldmslen, ldmslen=ldmslen
              Specify the minimum searched length of a match for long distance
              matching.

              This option is ignored unless long distance matching is enabled.

              Larger/very small values usually decrease compression ratio.

              The minumum ldmslen is 4 and the maximum is 4096 (default: 64).

       ldmBucketSizeLog=ldmblog, ldmblog=ldmblog
              Specify the size of each bucket for the hash table used for long
              distance matching.

              This option is ignored unless long distance matching is enabled.

              Larger bucket sizes improve collision resolution but decrease
              compression speed.

              The minimum ldmblog is 0 and the maximum is 8 (default: 3).

       ldmHashEveryLog=ldmhevery, ldmhevery=ldmhevery
              Specify the frequency of inserting entries into the long
              distance matching hash table.

              This option is ignored unless long distance matching is enabled.

              Larger values will improve compression speed. Deviating far from
              the default value will likely result in a decrease in
              compression ratio.

              The default value is wlog - ldmhlog.

   -B#:
       Select the size of each compression job. This parameter is available
       only when multi-threading is enabled. Default value is 4 * windowSize,
       which means it varies depending on compression level. -B# makes it
       possible to select a custom value. Note that job size must respect a
       minimum value which is enforced transparently. This minimum is either 1
       MB, or overlapSize, whichever is largest.

   Example
       The following parameters sets advanced compression options to those of
       predefined level 19 for files bigger than 256 KB:

       --zstd=windowLog=23,chainLog=23,hashLog=22,searchLog=6,searchLength=3,targetLength=48,strategy=6
