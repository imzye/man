POPPWD(8)               FreeBSD System Manager's Manual              POPPWD(8)

NAME
     poppwd – Eudora compatible password change server

SYNOPSIS
     poppwd [-Pv]

DESCRIPTION
     poppwd implements the Eudora password changing protocol. This allows
     Eudora compatible clients to change a users password via the network.
     poppwd is intended to be called from inetd(8).

     The following options are available:

     -P      Use PAM for authentication and to perform the password change.
             Without this option getpwnam(3) is used for authentication and
             pw(8) to perform the change.

     -v      Print the version string and copyright notice and then exit.

     Unless using PAM only non system users (by default, those with a UID
     greater than 1000 though this value may be changed at compilation time)
     can change their passwords via poppwd.  If using PAM these types of
     restrictions should be implemented via the PAM configuration.

   PAM
     PAM support can be enabled by passing the -P argument to poppwd.  The
     default PAM service name is pop3pw.  Only the auth and password PAM
     facilites are used. Both facilities must be configured to use the
     use_first_pass option. See EXAMPLES for an example of a basic PAM
     configuration file.

FILES
     /etc/inetd.conf    poppwd invocation
     /etc/pam.d/pop3pw  PAM configuration
     /etc/syslog.conf   logging specifications

EXAMPLES
     Assuming poppwd is installed in /usr/local/libexec an entry similar to
     the following could be made in /etc/inetd.conf. Append -P to enable PAM
     support.

     pop3pw stream tcp nowait root /usr/local/libexec/poppwd poppwd

     A valid PAM configuration file that has poppwd use the local system
     password database is as follows.

     auth            required        pam_unix.so     use_first_pass
     password        required        pam_unix.so     use_first_pass

DIAGNOSTICS
     Errors are logged to syslog(8) using the auth facility and are hopefully
     self explanatory.

HISTORY
     poppwd was written in response to a spate of error reports about pty
     handling in poppassd(8).  It looked easier to re-engineer than work out
     what was wrong with poppassd(8).  poppwd was developed under MacOS X and
     FreeBSD.

AUTHORS
     poppwd was written by Andrew Stevenson ⟨andrew@ugh.net.au⟩.
