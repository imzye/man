LOCK(1)                 FreeBSD General Commands Manual                LOCK(1)

NAME
     lock – reserve a terminal

SYNOPSIS
     lock [-npv] [-t timeout]

DESCRIPTION
     The lock utility requests a password from the user, reads it again for
     verification and then will normally not relinquish the terminal until the
     password is repeated.  There are two other conditions under which it will
     terminate: it will timeout after some interval of time and it may be
     killed by someone with the appropriate permission.

     The following options are available:

     -n      Do not use a timeout value.  Terminal will be locked forever.

     -p      A password is not requested, instead the user's current login
             password is used.

     -t timeout
             The time limit (default 15 minutes) is changed to timeout
             minutes.

     -v      Disable switching virtual terminals while this terminal is
             locked.  This option is implemented in a way similar to the -S
             option of vidcontrol(1), and thus has the same restrictions.  It
             is only available if the terminal in question is a syscons(4) or
             vt(4) virtual terminal.
