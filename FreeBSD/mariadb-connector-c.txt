mariadb_cancel(3)             MariaDB Connector/C            mariadb_cancel(3)

   Name
       mariadb_cancel - Immediately aborts a connection

   Synopsis
              #include <mysql.h>

              int mariadb_cancel(MYSQL * mysql);

   Description
       Immediately aborts a connection by making all subsequent read/write
       operations fail.  mariadb_cancel() does not invalidate memory used for
       mysql structure, nor close any communication channels.  To free the
       memory, mysql_close(3) must be called.  mariadb_cancel() is useful to
       break long queries in situations where sending KILL is not possible.

   Parameter
       mysql - mysql handle, which was previously allocated by mysql_init(3)
       and connected by mysql_real_connect(3).

   Return value
       Returns zero on success or a non-zero value on error.

   History
       mariadb_cancel() was added in Connector/C 3.0

Version 3.4                                                  mariadb_cancel(3)
