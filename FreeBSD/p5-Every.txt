Every(3)              User Contributed Perl Documentation             Every(3)


NAME
       Every - return true every N cycles or S seconds

SYNOPSIS
        for (0..200)
        {
         print_stats() if every(20);           # every 20 cycles
         print_times() if every(seconds => 5); # every 5 or more seconds
         sleep 3;
        }

FUNCTION-ORIENTED INTERFACE
   every( $number [, @id] )
   every( seconds => $number [, @id] )
       Returns true every $number times it's called, or every time $number
       seconds have elapsed since the last time it was called.

       The every() function keeps track of where it was called by line, even
       if you call it twice on the same line, e.g.

        print "hello" if every(5) or every(6);

       The every() function will use the Devel::Callsite module to find the
       opcode and interpreter context (both unique numbers).

       The optional @id is a list of arguments that compose a unique
       identifier.  In other words, "every(100, 'x')" will run its 100 cycles
       independently of "every(100, 'x', 'y')".

DESCRIPTION
       Returns true when the conditions (cycles or seconds elapsed) are met.
       The first cycle doesn't count (so e.g. every(100) will be true at 100,
       200, etc.)

       Thanks to Dr.Ruud on comp.lang.perl.misc for helping with this idea,
       and to Jerry Hedden for cleaning it up.  Thanks to Ben Morrow for
       getting Devel::Callsite started, which module is essential to Every.

       Thanks to Jerrad Pierce and ikegami for the bug reports and help.
