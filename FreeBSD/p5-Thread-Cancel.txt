NAME
       Thread::Cancel - Cancel (i.e., kill) threads

VERSION
       This document describes Thread::Cancel version 1.13

SYNOPSIS
           use Thread::Cancel 'SIGUSR1';      # Set the cancellation signal
           use Thread::Cancel;                #  Defaults to 'KILL'

           $thr->cancel();                    # Cancel a thread
           threads->cancel();                 # Cancel all non-detached threads
           threads->cancel($thr, $tid, ...);  # Cancel multiple threads using
                                               #   objects or TIDs

DESCRIPTION
       This module adds cancellation capabilities for threads.  Cancelled
       threads are terminated using "threads->exit()".  The thread is then
       detached, and hence automatically cleaned up.

       Threads that are suspended using Thread::Suspend do not need to be
       resumed in order to be cancelled.

       It is possible for a thread to cancel itself.

   Declaration
       This module must be imported prior to any threads being created.

       Cancellation is accomplished via a signal handler which is used by all
       threads on which cancel operations are performed.  The signal for this
       operation can be specified when this module is declared, and defaults
       to "SIGKILL".  Consequently, the application and its threads must not
       specify some other handler for use with the cancel signal.

       use Thread::Cancel;
           Declares this module, and defaults to using "SIGKILL" for cancel
           operations.

       use Thread::Cancel 'SIGUSR1';
       use Thread::Cancel 'Signal' => 11;
           Declares this module, and uses the specified signal for cancel
           operations.  Signals may be specified by the same names or
           (positive) numbers as supported by kill().

   Methods
       $thr->cancel()
           Cancels the threads.

       threads->cancel()
           Cancels all non-detached threads.  This offers a clean way to exit
           a threaded application:

               # Terminate all threads and exit
               threads->cancel();
               exit(0);

       threads->cancel($thr, $tid, ...)
           Cancels the threads specified by their objects or TIDs (for non-
           detached threads).

CAVEATS
       Subject to the limitations of "THREAD SIGNALLING" in threads.

       Cancelled threads are automatically detached, so do not try to
       "->join()" or "->detach()" a cancelled thread.

       Detached threads can only be cancelled using their threads object:

           $thr->detach();
           $thr->cancel();
           # or
           threads->cancel($thr);

       Threads that have finished execution are, for the most part, ignored by
       this module.

REQUIREMENTS
       Perl 5.8.0 or later

       threads 1.39 or later
