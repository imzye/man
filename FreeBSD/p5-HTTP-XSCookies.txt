NAME
       HTTP::XSCookies - Fast XS cookie mangling for Perl

VERSION
       Version 0.000021

SYNOPSIS
           use HTTP::XSCookies qw/bake_cookie crush_cookie/;

           my $cookie = bake_cookie('Perl&C' => 'They rulez!');
           my $values = crush_cookie($cookie);

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements cookie creation (baking) and parsing (crushing)
       using XS, therefore improving the speed of a pure Perl implementation.

METHODS/ATTRIBUTES
   bake_cookie
           my $cookie = bake_cookie('foo' => 'bar');

           my $cookie = bake_cookie('baz', {
               value   => 'Frodo',
               path    => 'myPath',
               domain  => '.test.com',
               expires => '+11h'
           });

       Generate a cookie string with proper encoding. The first argument is
       the cookie name; the second argument can be a string (the cookie value)
       or a hashref with a set of key-value pairs.

       The value for any of these attributes can be an arrayref (multi-valued
       cookie); if this is the case, the elements of the array will be
       concatenated with an '&' character and the whole string will be URL-
       encoded.

       These are the keys that are recognized:

       •   value: the cookie's value (a string).

       •   Domain: the cookie's domain (a string).

       •   Path: the cookie's path (a string).

       •   Max-Age: the cookie's maximum age (a string).

       •   Expires: the cookie's expiration date/time, in any of the following
           formats:

               Expires => time + 3 * 60 * 60 # 3 hours from now
               Expires => 'Wed, 18-Sep-2016 22:33:44 GMT'  # fixed time
               Expires => '+20s' # 20 seconds from now
               Expires => '+40m' # 40 minutes from now
               Expires => '+2h'  # 2 hours from now
               Expires => '-3d'  # 3 days ago (i.e. "expired")
               Expires => '+4M'  # in 4 months
               Expires => '+8y'  # in 8 years
               Expires => 'now'  # right now

       •   Secure: whether the cookie is secure (a boolean, default is false).

       •   HttpOnly: whether the cookie is HTTP only (a boolean, default is
           false).

       •   SameSite: whether the cookie ought not to be sent along with cross-
           site requests (a string, either strict or lax, default is unset).
           See:
           <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-first-party-cookies-07>.

   crush_cookie
           my $values = crush_cookie( $cookie [, $allow_no_value] );

       Parse a (properly encoded) cookie string into a hashref with the
       individual values.

       If the second parameter is non-zero, the parsing will allow for
       attributes without a value, and set those to have a value of undef in
       the returned hashref (so that they can easily be differentiated from an
       attribute with an explicit value).  The default is 0.

       If any of the (URL-decoded) values contains an '&' character, that
       value is interpreted as multiple values, so an arrayref of each
       separate component is returned.
