swapmon(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             swapmon(1)

NAME
     swapmon – monitor swapusage, add swapspace as needed

SYNOPSIS
     swapmon [start|stop|-F] add/remove swapspace automatically as needed

DESCRIPTION
     swapmon will check the current swapusage and if more than SWAP_HIGH
     percent of swapspace is in use it will create a new swapfile with a size
     of size of SWAP_STEP percent of the current swapspace and activate it.
     If less than SWAP_LOW percent of swapspace is in use it will deactivate a
     previously added swapspace file and remove it.

     If called with start it will fork into the background and run as a
     daemon. It will check and then sleep for DELAY seconds before checking
     again. Messages about the operation will be piped to LOGGER. The pid of
     the daemon will be written to PIDFILE.

     If called with stop it stop a previously forked swapmon daemon.

     If called with -F it will run as a daemon but not detach from the
     terminal. Messages will still be piped to LOGGGER and not to the terminal
     by default. You may specify "/bin/cat" as LOGGER to get the messages on
     the terminal.

     Default values:

     SWAP_HIGH
              75

     SWAP_LOW
              45

     SWAP_STEP
              100-SWAP_HIGH (=25)

     SM_HOME  "/usr/.swap/"

     DELAY    30

     LOGGER   /usr/bin/logger

     PIDFILE  /var/run/swapmon.pid

     swapmon can be called via cron(5). In that case you would receive
     messages about the swapspace being adjusted via e-mail. To use it that
     way add a crontab entry to the root crontab similar to this:

     * * * * * /usr/local/sbin/swapmon

FILES
     /usr/local/etc/swapmonrc  optional configuration file for overwriting the
                               defaults above
     $SM_HOME                  The "homedirectory" of swapmon. In here the
                               swapfiles as well as a lockfile and the
                               swapfile list will be created.
