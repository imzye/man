NAME
       ii - irc it or irc improved

SYNOPSIS
       ii -s host [-p port | -u sockname] [-i ircdir] [-n nickname] [-f
       realname] [-k env_pass]

DESCRIPTION
       ii is a minimalistic FIFO and filesystem based IRC client.  It creates
       an irc directory tree with server, channel and nick name directories.
       In every directory a FIFO file (in) and normal file (out) is placed.
       This will be for example ~/irc/irc.freenode.net/.  The in file is used
       to communicate with the servers and the out files includes the server
       messages. For every channel and every nick name there will be new in
       and out files.  The basic idea of this is to be able to communicate
       with an IRC server with basic command line tools.  For example if you
       will join a channel just do echo "/j #channel" > in and ii creates a
       new channel directory with in and out file.

OPTIONS
       -s host
              server/host to connect to, for example: irc.freenode.net

       -p port
              lets you override the default port (6667)

       -u sockname
              connect to a UNIX domain socket instead of directly to a server.
              If set, the -p option will be ignored.

       -i ircdir
              lets you override the default irc path (~/irc)

       -n nickname
              lets you override the default nick ($USER)

       -f realname
              lets you specify your real name associated with your nick

       -k env_pass
              lets you specify an environment variable that contains your IRC
              password, e.g. IIPASS="foobar" ii -k IIPASS.  This is done in
              order to prevent other users from eavesdropping the server
              password via the process list.

DIRECTORIES
       ~/irc  In this directory the irc tree will be created. In this
              directory you will find a directory for your server (default:
              irc.freenode.net) in which the FIFO and the output file will be
              stored.  If you join a channel a new directory with the name of
              the channel will be created in the ~/irc/servername/ directory.

COMMANDS
       /a [message]
              mark yourself as away, with the optional message as an away
              reason.

       /j #channel [password]
              join a #channel, with the optional password.

       /j nickname [message]
              open private conversation with user nickname and directly send
              the optional message.

       /l [reason]
              leave a channel or query, giving the optional reason message.

       /n nick
              change the nick name to nick.

       /q [reason]
              quit ii, giving the optional reason message.

       /t topic
              set the topic of a channel with topic.

RAW COMMANDS
       Everything which is not a command will be posted into the channel or to
       the server.  So if you need /who just write /WHO as described in
       RFC#1459 to the server in FIFO.

SSL/TLS PROTOCOL SUPPORT
       For SSL/TLS protocol support you can connect to a local tunnel, for
       example with stunnel or socat.
