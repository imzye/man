ISER(4)                FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                ISER(4)

NAME
     iser – iSCSI Extensions for RDMA (iSER) driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following line in the
     kernel configuration file:

           device iser

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           iser_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The iser (iSCSI Extensions for RDMA) initiator driver extends the iSCSI
     protocol to RDMA.  It permits data to be transferred directly into and
     out of SCSI buffers without intermediate data copies.  iSER uses the RDMA
     protocol suite to supply higher bandwidth for block storage transfers
     (zero copy behavior).  To that fact, it eliminates the TCP/IP processing
     overhead while preserving the compatibility with iSCSI protocol.  The
     initiator is the iSCSI/iSER client, which connects to an iSCSI/iSER
     target, providing local access to a remote block device.  The userland
     component is provided by iscsid(8) and both the kernel and userland are
     configured using iscsictl(8).

SYSCTL VARIABLES
     The following variables are available as both sysctl(8) variables and
     loader(8) tunables:

     kern.iser.debug
             Verbosity level for log messages from the iser driver.  Set to 0
             to disable logging or 1 to warn about potential problems.  Larger
             values enable info and debugging output.  Defaults to 0.
