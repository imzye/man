FUNCTIONS
   SRVorder
       This takes the returned answer array containing Net::DNS::RR::SRV
       objects and processes them into a new easy to use array of hashes
       ordered by priority and weight.

       One item is taken and that is the array returned from the answers
       method.

       Upon a error or no records being present, undef is returned.

RETURN VALUE
       The returned value is a array.

       Each item of the array is a hash.

       The keys listed below are used for the hash.

   server
       This is the server to use.

   port
       This is the port to use for this server.

   priority
       This is the priority of this server.

   weight
