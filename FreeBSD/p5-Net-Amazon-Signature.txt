Net::Amazon::Signature(3)                  User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Net::Amazon::Signature

VERSION
       Version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
        use Net::Amazon::Signature;
        my $sig_maker = Net::Amazon::Signature->new(Service => AWSServiceName);

        my ($signature, $timestamp) = $sig_maker->create({
         Operation => 'GetInfo',
         SecretAccessKey => 'Your Secret Key Here',
         uri_escape => 1
        });

        # go ahead and make your SOAP or REST call now...

DESCRIPTION
       This module creates the encrypted signature needed to login to Amazon's
       Mechanical Turk and Alexa web services and any other web services that
       Amazon might make in the future that require an encrypted signature,
       assuming they follow the same convention.

METHODS
   new
        creates a new Net::Amazon::Signature object
        Takes in a hashref with key Service
        Example
        my $foo = Net::Amazon::Signature->new({Service => 'AWSMechanicalTurkRequester'});

   create
        Creates the signature. The method takes in a hashref with two required values:
        * SecretAccessKey - the secret access key that Amazon has assigned to you.
        * Operation - the name of the operation to perform.

        Returns an array with the signature and the timestamp used in creating the authenticated request.

   _make_signature
       makes the encoded signature give an unencoded string and a hashing key
       (the secret access id).  You do not need to call this function
       directly. Call create_signature instead.
