NAME
     re – RealTek 8139C+/8169/816xS/811xS/8168/810xE/8111 PCI/PCIe Ethernet
     adapter driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device miibus
           device re

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_re_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The re driver provides support for various NICs based on the RealTek
     RTL8139C+, RTL8169, RTL816xS, RTL811xS, RTL8168, RTL810xE and RTL8111 PCI
     and PCIe Ethernet controllers.

     NICs based on the 8139C+ and 810xE are capable of 10 and 100Mbps speeds
     over CAT5 cable.  NICs based on the 8169, 816xS, 811xS, 8168 and 8111 are
     capable of 10, 100 and 1000Mbps operation.

     All NICs supported by the re driver have TCP/IP checksum offload and
     hardware VLAN tagging/insertion features, and use a descriptor-based DMA
     mechanism.  They are also capable of TCP large send (TCP segmentation
     offload).

     The 8139C+ is a single-chip solution combining both a 10/100 MAC and PHY.
     The 8169 is a 10/100/1000 MAC only, requiring a GMII or TBI external PHY.
     The 816xS, 811xS, 8168 and 8111 are single-chip devices containing both a
     10/100/1000 MAC and 10/100/1000 copper PHY.  Standalone 10/100/1000 cards
     are available in both 32-bit PCI and 64-bit PCI models.  The 8110S is
     designed for embedded LAN-on-motherboard applications.

     The 8169, 8169S and 8110S also support jumbo frames, which can be
     configured via the interface MTU setting.  The MTU is limited to 7422,
     since the chip cannot transmit larger frames.  Selecting an MTU larger
     than 1500 bytes with the ifconfig(8) utility configures the adapter to
     receive and transmit jumbo frames.

     The re driver supports the following media types:

     autoselect       Enable autoselection of the media type and options.  The
                      user can manually override the autoselected mode by
                      adding media options to rc.conf(5).

     10baseT/UTP      Set 10Mbps operation.  The ifconfig(8) mediaopt option
                      can also be used to select either full-duplex or
                      half-duplex modes.

     100baseTX        Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.  The ifconfig(8)
                      mediaopt option can also be used to select either
                      full-duplex or half-duplex modes.

     1000baseTX       Set 1000baseTX operation over twisted pair.  The RealTek
                      gigE chips support 1000Mbps in full-duplex mode only.

     The re driver supports the following media options:

     full-duplex      Force full duplex operation.

     half-duplex      Force half duplex operation.

     For more information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

LOADER TUNABLES
     Tunables can be set at the loader(8) prompt before booting the kernel or
     stored in loader.conf(5).

     hw.re.intr_filter
             This tunable makes driver use interrupt filter handler on
             controllers that support MSI/MSI-X capability.  If MSI/MSI-X is
             disabled by administrator this tunable has no effect and driver
             will use interrupt filter handler.  The default value is 0 to use
             interrupt thread handler.

     hw.re.msi_disable
             This tunable disables MSI support on the Ethernet hardware.  The
             default value is 0.

     hw.re.msix_disable
             This tunable disables MSI-X support on the Ethernet hardware.
             The default value is 0.

     hw.re.prefer_iomap
             This tunable controls which register mapping should be used on
             the specified device.  A non-zero value enables I/O space
             register mapping.  The default value is 0 to use memory space
             register mapping.

SYSCTL VARIABLES
     The following variables are available as both sysctl(8) variables and
     loader(8) tunables:

     dev.re.%d.int_rx_mod
             Maximum amount of time to delay receive interrupt processing in
             units of 1us.  The accepted range is 0 to 65, the default is
             65(65us).  Value 0 completely disables the interrupt moderation.
             The interface need to be brought down and up again before a
             change takes effect.

DIAGNOSTICS
     re%d: couldn't map memory  A fatal initialization error has occurred.

     re%d: couldn't map ports  A fatal initialization error has occurred.

     re%d: couldn't map interrupt  A fatal initialization error has occurred.

     re%d: no memory for softc struct!  The driver failed to allocate memory
     for per-device instance information during initialization.

     re%d: failed to enable memory mapping!  The driver failed to initialize
     PCI shared memory mapping.  This might happen if the card is not in a
     bus-master slot.

     re%d: no memory for jumbo buffers!  The driver failed to allocate memory
     for jumbo frames during initialization.

     re%d: watchdog timeout  The device has stopped responding to the network,
     or there is a problem with the network connection (cable).

HISTORY

AUTHORS
     The re driver was written by Bill Paul <wpaul@windriver.com>.

BUGS
     The Xterasys XN-152 32-bit PCI NIC, which uses the RTL8169 MAC and
     Marvell 88E1000 PHY, has a defect that causes DMA corruption if the board
     is plugged into a 64-bit PCI slot.  The defect lies in the board design,
     not the chip itself: the PCI REQ64# and ACK64# lines should be pulled
     high, but they are not.  The result is that the 8169 chip is tricked into
     performing 64-bit DMA transfers even though a 64-bit data path between
     the NIC and the bus does not actually exist.

     Unfortunately, it is not possible to correct this problem in software,
     however it is possible to detect it.  When the re driver is loaded, it
     will run a diagnostic routine designed to validate DMA operation by
     placing the chip in digital loopback mode and initiating a packet
     transmission.  If the card functions properly, the transmitted data will
     be echoed back unmodified.  If the echoed data is corrupt, the driver
     will print an error message on the console and abort the device attach.
     The user should ensure the NIC is installed in a 32-bit PCI slot to avoid
     this problem.

     The RealTek 8169, 8169S and 8110S chips appear to only be capable of
     transmitting jumbo frames up to 7.5K in size.
