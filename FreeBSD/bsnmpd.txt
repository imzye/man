NAME
     bsnmpd – simple and extensible SNMP daemon

SYNOPSIS
     bsnmpd [-dh] [-c file] [-D options] [-e file] [-I paths] [-l prefix]
            [-m variable[=value]] [-p file]

DESCRIPTION
     The bsnmpd daemon serves the internet SNMP (Simple Network Management
     Protocol).  It is intended to serve only the absolute basic MIBs and
     implement all other MIBs through loadable modules.  In this way the
     bsnmpd can be used in unexpected ways.

     The options are as follows:

     -d                   Do not daemonize.  Used for debugging.

     -h                   Print a short usage message.

     -c file              Use file as configuration file instead of the
                          standard one.

     -D options           Debugging options are specified with a -o flag
                          followed by a comma separated string of options.
                          The following options are available.

                          dump                              Dump all sent and
                                                            received PDUs to
                                                            the terminal.

                          events                            Set the debugging
                                                            level of the event
                                                            library (see
                                                            eventlib(3)) to
                                                            10.

                          trace=level                       Set the snmp
                                                            library trace flag
                                                            to the specified
                                                            value.
                          The value can be specified in the usual C-syntax for
                          numbers.

     -e file              Specify an alternate file where the agent's engine
                          id and number of boots are saved.

     -I paths             Specify a colon separated list of directories to
                          search for configuration include files.  The default
                          is /etc:/usr/etc/:/usr/local/etc.  These paths are
                          only searched for include specified within <>
                          parentheses.

     -l prefix            Use prefix as the default basename for the pid and
                          the configuration files.

     -m variable[=value]  Define a configuration variable.

     -p file              Specify an alternate pid file instead of the default
                          one.

CONFIGURATION
     bsnmpd reads its configuration from either the default or the user
     specified configuration file.  The configuration file consists of the
     following types of lines:

           •   variable assignments

           •   section separators

           •   include directives

           •   MIB variable assignments

     If a line is too long it can be continued on the next line by ending it
     with a backslash.  Empty lines and lines in which the first non-blank
     character is a “#” sign are ignored.

     All MIB variable assignments of the entire configuration (including
     nested configuration files) are handled as one transaction, i.e., as if
     they arrived in a single SET PDU.  Any failure during the initial
     configuration read causes bsnmpd to exit.  A failure during the
     configuration read caused by a module load causes the loading of the
     module to fail.

     The configuration is read during initialization of bsnmpd, when a module
     is loaded and when bsnmpd receives a SIGHUP.

   VARIABLE ASSIGNMENTS
     Variable assignments can take one of two forms:

           variable := string
           variable ?= string

     The string reaches from the first non-blank character after the equal
     sign until the first new line or “#” character.  In the first case the
     string is assigned to the variable unconditionally, in the second case
     the variable is only assigned if it does not exist yet.

     Variable names must begin with a letter or underscore and contain only
     letters, digits or underscores.

   SECTION SEPARATORS
     The configuration consists of named sections.  The MIB variable
     assignments in the section named “snmpd” are executed only during initial
     setup or when bsnmpd receives a SIGHUP.  All other sections are executed
     when either a module with the same name as the section is loaded or
     bsnmpd receives a SIGHUP and that module is already loaded.  The default
     section at the start of the configuration is “snmpd”.  One can switch to
     another section with the syntax

           %secname

     Where secname is the name of the section.  The same secname can be used
     in more than one place in the configuration.  All of these parts are
     collected into one section.

   INCLUDE DIRECTIVES
     Another configuration file can be included into the current one with the
     include directive that takes one of two forms:

           .include "file"
           .include <"file">

     The first form causes the file to be searched in the current directory,
     the second form causes the file to be searched in the directories
     specified in the system include path.  Nesting depth is only restricted
     by available memory.

   MIB VARIABLE ASSIGNMENTS
     A MIB variable is assigned with the syntax

           oid [ suboids ] = value

     oid is the name of the variable to be set.  Only the last component of
     the entire name is used here.  If the variable is a scalar, the index
     (.0) is automatically appended and need not to be specified.  If the
     variable is a table column, the index (suboids) must be specified.  The
     index consist of elements each separated from the previous one by a dot.
     Elements may be either numbers, strings or hostnames enclosed in []
     brackets.  If the element is a number it is appended to the current oid.
     If the element is a string, its length and the ASCII code of each of its
     characters are appended to the current oid.  If the element is a
     hostname, the IP address of the host is looked up and the four elements
     of the IP address are appended to the oid.

     For example, an oid of

           myvariable.27.foooll.[localhost]."&^!"

     results in the oid

           myvariable.27.102.111.111.111.108.108.127.0.0.1.38.94.33

     The value of the assignment may be either empty, a string or a number.
     If a string starts with a letter or an underscore and consists only of
     letters, digits, underscores and minus signs, it can be written without
     quotes.  In all other cases the string must be enclosed in double quotes.

SUBSTITUTIONS
     A variable substitution is written as

           $(variable)

     where variable is the name of the variable to substitute.  Using an
     undefined variable is considered an error.

                                                  be enforced by TCP wrappers
                                                  are defined here.  Further
                                                  details are described in
