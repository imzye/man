RDMA_JOIN_MULTICAST(3)   Librdmacm Programmer's Manual  RDMA_JOIN_MULTICAST(3)



NAME
       rdma_join_multicast - Joins a multicast group.

SYNOPSIS
       #include <rdma/rdma_cma.h>

       int rdma_join_multicast (struct rdma_cm_id *id, struct sockaddr *addr,
       void *context);

ARGUMENTS
       id          Communication identifier associated with the request.

       addr        Multicast address identifying the group to join.

       context     User-defined context associated with the join request.

DESCRIPTION
       Joins a multicast group and attaches an associated QP to the group.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error.  If an error occurs, errno will
       be set to indicate the failure reason.

NOTES
       Before joining a multicast group, the rdma_cm_id must be bound to an
       RDMA device by calling rdma_bind_addr or rdma_resolve_addr.  Use of
       rdma_resolve_addr requires the local routing tables to resolve the
       multicast address to an RDMA device, unless a specific source address
       is provided.  The user must call rdma_leave_multicast to leave the
       multicast group and release any multicast resources.  After the join
       operation completes, if a QP is associated with the rdma_cm_id, it is
       automatically attached to the multicast group when the multicast event
       is retrieved by the user.  Otherwise, the user is responsible for
       calling ibv_attach_mcast to bind the QP to the multicast group.  The
       join context is returned to the user through the private_data field in
       the rdma_cm_event.
