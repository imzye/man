NAME
       Test::Mock::Guard - Simple mock test library using RAII.

SYNOPSIS
         use Test::More;
         use Test::Mock::Guard qw(mock_guard);

         package Some::Class;

         sub new { bless {} => shift }
         sub foo { "foo" }
         sub bar { 1; }

         package main;

         {
             my $guard = mock_guard( 'Some::Class', { foo => sub { "bar" }, bar => 10 } );
             my $obj = Some::Class->new;
             is( $obj->foo, "bar" );
             is( $obj->bar, 10 );
         }

         my $obj = Some::Class->new;
         is( $obj->foo, "foo" );
         is( $obj->bar, 1 );

         done_testing;

DESCRIPTION
       Test::Mock::Guard is mock test library using RAII.  This module is able
       to change method behavior by each scope. See SYNOPSIS's sample code.

EXPORT FUNCTION
   mock_guard( @class_defs )
       @class_defs have the following format.

       key Class name or object to mock.

       value
           Hash reference. Keys are method names; values are code references
           or scalars.  If the value is code reference, it is used as a
           method.  If the value is a scalar, the method will return the
           specified value.

       You can mock instance methods as well as class methods (this feature
       was provided by cho45):

         use Test::More;
         use Test::Mock::Guard qw(mock_guard);

         package Some::Class;

         sub new { bless {} => shift }
         sub foo { "foo" }

         package main;

         my $obj1 = Some::Class->new;
         my $obj2 = Some::Class->new;

         {
             my $obj2 = Some::Class->new;
             my $guard = mock_guard( $obj2, { foo => sub { "bar" } } );
             is ($obj1->foo, "foo", "obj1 has not changed" );
             is( $obj2->foo, "bar", "obj2 is mocked" );
         }

         is( $obj1->foo, "foo", "obj1" );
         is( $obj2->foo, "foo", "obj2" );

         done_testing;

METHODS
   new( @class_defs )
       See "mock_guard" definition.

   call_count( $class_name_or_object, $method_name )
       Returns a number of calling of $method_name in $class_name_or_object.
