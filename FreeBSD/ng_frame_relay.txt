NAME
     ng_frame_relay – frame relay netgraph node type

SYNOPSIS
     #include <netgraph/ng_frame_relay.h>

DESCRIPTION
     The frame_relay node type performs encapsulation, de-encapsulation, and
     multiplexing of packets using the frame relay protocol.  It supports up
     to 1024 DLCI's.  The LMI protocol is handled by a separate node type (see
     ng_lmi(4)).

     The downstream hook should be connected to the synchronous line, i.e.,
     the switch.  Then hooks dlci0, dlci1, through dlci1023 are available to
     connect to each of the DLCI channels.

HOOKS
     This node type supports the following hooks:

     downstream      The connection to the synchronous line.

     dlciX           Here X is a decimal number from 0 to 1023.  This hook
                     corresponds to the DLCI X frame relay virtual channel.

CONTROL MESSAGES
     This node type supports only the generic control messages.

SHUTDOWN
     This node shuts down upon receipt of a NGM_SHUTDOWN control message, or
     when all hooks have been disconnected.

HISTORY
     The ng_frame_relay node type was implemented in FreeBSD 4.0.

BUGS
     Technically, frames on DLCI X should not be transmitted to the switch
     until the LMI protocol entity on both ends has configured DLCI X as
     active.  The ng_frame_relay node type ignores this restriction, and will
     always pass data received on a DLCI hook to downstream.  Instead, it
     should query the LMI node first.
