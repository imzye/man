               use Acme::ButFirst;

               # Print a greeting, but first find caffiene.

               {
                       print "Good morning!\n";
               } but first {

               }

               # Count from 1 to 10, but first print a statement
               # about our counting skills.

               foreach my $count (1..10) {

               } but first {
                       print "I can count to...";
               }

               while (<>) {
                       print;
               } butfirst {
                       $_ = reverse $_;
               } butfirst {
                       $_ = uc $_;
               }

DESCRIPTION
       "Acme::ButFirst" allows you to execute a block of code, but first do
       something else.  Perfect for when you wish to add to the start of a
       long block of code, but don't have the energy to scroll upwards in your
       editor.

       "Acme::ButFirst" recognises both "butfirst" and "but first" as
       keywords.

       Usage of "Acme::ButFirst" is lexically scoped.  ButFirstification can
       be explicitly disabled by using "no Acme::ButFirst".

BUGS
       Any use of this module should be considered a bug.

       Strings in the form of " { work } but first { coffee } " may sometimes
       be incorrectly munged.
