RDMA_POST_RECV(3)        Librdmacm Programmer's Manual       RDMA_POST_RECV(3)



NAME
       rdma_post_recv - post a work request to receive an incoming message.

SYNOPSIS
       #include <rdma/rdma_verbs.h>

       int rdma_post_recv (struct rdma_cm_id *id, void *context, void *addr,
       size_t length, struct ibv_mr *mr);

ARGUMENTS
       id          A reference to a communication identifier where the message
                   buffer will be posted.

       context     User-defined context associated with the request.

       addr        The address of the memory buffer to post.

       length      The length of the memory buffer.

       mr          A registered memory region associated with the posted
                   buffer.

DESCRIPTION
       Posts a work request to the receive queue of the queue pair associated
       with the rdma_cm_id.  The posted buffer will be queued to receive an
       incoming message sent by the remote peer.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error.  If an error occurs, errno will
       be set to indicate the failure reason.

NOTES
       The user is responsible for ensuring that a receive buffer is posted
       and large enough to contain all sent data before the peer posts the
       corresponding send message.  The message buffer must have been
       registered before being posted, with the mr parameter referencing the
       registration.  The buffer must remain registered until the receive
       completes.

       Messages may be posted to an rdma_cm_id only after a queue pair has
       been associated with it.  A queue pair is bound to an rdma_cm_id after
       calling rdma_create_ep or rdma_create_qp, if the rdma_cm_id is
       allocated using rdma_create_id.

       The user-defined context associated with the receive request will be
       returned to the user through the work completion wr_id, work request
       identifier, field.
