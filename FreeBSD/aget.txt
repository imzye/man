NAME
       aget - A multithreaded HTTP download accelerator

SYNOPSIS
       aget [options] file ...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the aget commands.  This manual page
       was originally written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution.

       aget fetches HTTP URLs in a manner similar to wget, but segments the
       retrieval into multiple parts to increase download speed.  It can be
       many times as fast as wget in some circumstances.

       It is the starting point for a project attempting to replicate the
       functionality of a MS Windows program called Flashget.

OPTIONS
       -p     port number

       -l     local file name

       -h     Show summary of options.

       -v     Show version of program.

       -n     Suggested number of threads

       -f     force using suggested number of threads


EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values are returned:

       0
              Successful completion.


       1
              Application exited with failure.


       -1
              POSIX pthreads creation error occurred.



EXAMPLES
       Example 1: Say you want to download a URL using 10 threads, just type:

       example% aget -n 10 http://www.enderunix.org/murat/barismanco-hibrahimsofrasi.mp3
