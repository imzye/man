CISS(4)                FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                CISS(4)

NAME
     ciss – Common Interface for SCSI-3 Support driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device scbus
           device ciss

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           ciss_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The ciss driver claims to provide a common interface between generic SCSI
     transports and intelligent host adapters.

     The ciss driver supports CISS as defined in the document entitled CISS
     Command Interface for SCSI-3 Support Open Specification, Version 1.04,
     Valence Number 1, dated 2000/11/27, produced by Compaq Computer
     Corporation.

     We provide a shim layer between the ciss interface and CAM(4), offloading
     most of the queueing and being-a-disk chores onto CAM.  Entry to the
     driver is via the PCI bus attachment ciss_probe(), ciss_attach(), etc.
     and via the CAM interface ciss_cam_action(), and ciss_cam_poll().  The
     Compaq ciss adapters require faked responses to get reasonable behavior
     out of them.  In addition, the ciss command set is by no means adequate
     to support the functionality of a RAID controller, and thus the supported
     Compaq adapters utilize portions of the control protocol from earlier
     Compaq adapter families.

     Currently ciss supports the “simple” and “performant” transport layer.

     Non-disk devices (such as internal DATs and devices attached to the
     external SCSI bus) are supported as normal CAM devices provided that they
     are exported by the controller firmware and are not marked as being
     masked.  Masked devices can be exposed by setting the
     hw.ciss.expose_hidden_physical tunable to non-zero at boot time.  Direct
     Access devices (such as disk drives) are only exposed as pass(4) devices.
     Hot-insertion and removal of devices is supported and notification
     messages will be reported to the console and logs.

     The problem which adapter freezes with the message “ADAPTER HEARTBEAT
     FAILED” might be solved by updating the firmware and/or setting the
     hw.ciss.nop_message_heartbeat tunable to non-zero at boot time.
