NAME
     bgrot – a program to alleviate background boredom

SYNOPSIS
     background.sh
     createlist.sh

DESCRIPTION
     The bgrot suite consists of a set of scripts to handle background image
     rotation.  The user interface scripts are Bourne shell (/bin/sh) scripts,
     while the backends are implemented in Perl 5.  The primary user
     interfaces are provided by two scripts: background.sh and createlist.sh.

   background.sh
     background.sh is the meat of bgrot.  It is the script that handles the
     randomization of the background image list, and the rotation of the
     images.  Users may override the system defaults with a config file in
     their home directory.  $CONFDIR, which is where the system defaults live,
     is normally /usr/local/etc, though that maybe have been changed by your
     system administrator on installation.  The file $CONFDIR/bgrot.conf
     contains the system-wide defaults for bgrot, which can be overriden by
     creating the file $BGROTDIR/conf/bgrot.conf, (though $HOME/.bgrotrc is
     accepted for backward compatibility) and inserting the settings you wish
     to override into it.  Most of the settings are self-explanatory, the rest
     can be easily understood by a cursory examination of the scripts.

   createlist.sh
     createlist.sh Is a utility used to prepare the list of background images
     for background.sh.  All per-user information for bgrot is kept in
     $BGROTDIR, which is normally $HOME/.bgrot.  The createlist.sh program
     creates the image list from the images in $BGROTDIR/images (which can be
     a symlink or a directory of symlinks), and puts the output list into the
     file $BGROTDIR/conf/master.background.list.  Note that createlist.sh ONLY
     includes files with the extensions stated in the bgrot.conf file (either
     global or individual), and WILL recurse through subdirectories of
     $BGROTDIR/images.

USAGE
     Simple place the images you wish to rotate in the $BGROTDIR/images
     directory, run createlist.sh to create the master image list, and run
     background.sh in the background (perhaps nice'd, for instance
     /usr/bin/nice -15 background.sh & ), and it should run perfectly.  It's
     not that complicated.
