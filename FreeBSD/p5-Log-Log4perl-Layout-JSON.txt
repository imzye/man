NAME
       Log::Log4perl::Layout::JSON - Layout a log message as a JSON hash,
       including MDC data

VERSION
       version 0.61

SYNOPSIS
       Example configuration:

           log4perl.appender.Example.layout = Log::Log4perl::Layout::JSON
           log4perl.appender.Example.layout.field.message = %m{chomp}
           log4perl.appender.Example.layout.field.category = %c
           log4perl.appender.Example.layout.field.class = %C
           log4perl.appender.Example.layout.field.file = %F{1}
           log4perl.appender.Example.layout.field.sub = %M{1}
           log4perl.appender.Example.layout.include_mdc = 1

           # Optional truncation of specific fields
           log4perl.appender.Example.layout.maxkb.message = 2

           # Note: Appender option!
           # log4perl.appender.Example.warp_message = 0

       See below for more configuration options.

DESCRIPTION
       This class implements a "Log::Log4perl" layout format, similar to
       Log::Log4perl::Layout::PatternLayout except that the output is a JSON
       hash.

       The JSON hash is ASCII encoded, with no newlines or other whitespace,
       and is suitable for output, via Log::Log4perl appenders, to files and
       syslog etc.

       Contextual data in the Log::Log4perl::MDC hash will be included if
       "include_mdc" is true.

LAYOUT CONFIGURATION
   field
       Specify one or more fields to include in the JSON hash. The value is a
       string containing one of more Log::Log4perl::Layout::PatternLayout
       placeholders.  For example:

           log4perl.appender.Example.layout.field.message = %m{chomp}
           log4perl.appender.Example.layout.field.category = %c
           log4perl.appender.Example.layout.field.where = %F{1}:%L

       If no fields are specified, the default is "message = %m{chomp}".  It
       is recommended that "message" be the first field.

   prefix
       Specify a prefix string for the JSON. For example:

           log4perl.appender.Example.layout.prefix = @cee:

       See http://blog.gerhards.net/2012/03/cee-enhanced-syslog-defined.html

   format_prefix
       If this is turned on, the prefix is treated as a
       Log::Log4perl::Layout::PatternLayout string, and will be rendered as a
       pattern layout.

       For example:

           log4perl.appender.Example.layout.prefix = %m{chomp} @cee:
           log4perl.appender.Example.layout.format_prefix = 1

       Would log "Hello World" as:

           Hello World @cee:{ .. MDC as JSON ... }

       See also "prefix"

   exclude_message
       Exclude the message from the JSON (default: 0).  If you are logging the
       message in the prefix for example, you may want to omit the message
       from the JSON layout.

   include_mdc
       Include the data in the Log::Log4perl::MDC hash.

           log4perl.appender.Example.layout.include_mdc = 1

       See also "name_for_mdc".

   maxkb
       Use this name with the field name to specify a maximum length for a
       specific field. For example:

           log4perl.appender.Example.maxkb.message = 2

       Will truncate message if it is more than 2048 bytes in length.
       Truncated message will have a marker at the end like "...[truncated,
       was $len chars total]..."

   name_for_mdc
       Use this name as the key in the JSON hash for the contents of MDC data

           log4perl.appender.Example.layout.name_for_mdc = mdc

       If not set then MDC data is placed at top level of the hash.

       Where MDC field names match the names of fields defined by the Log4perl
       configuration then the MDC values take precedence. This is currently
       construde as a feature.

   canonical
       If true then use canonical order for hash keys when encoding the JSON.

           log4perl.appender.Example.layout.canonical = 1

       This is mainly intended for testing.

   max_json_length_kb
       Set the maximum JSON length in kilobytes. The default is 20KB.

           log4perl.appender.Example.layout.max_json_length_kb = 3.8

       This is useful where some downstream system has a limit on the maximum
       size of a message.

       For example, rsyslog has a "maxMessageSize" configuration parameter
       with a default of 4KB. Longer messages are simply truncated (which
       would corrupt the JSON). We use rsyslog with maxMessageSize set to
       128KB.

       If the JSON is larger than the specified size (not including "prefix")
       then some action is performed to reduce the size of the JSON.

       Currently fields are simply removed until the JSON is within the size.
       The MDC field/fields are removed first and then the fields specified in
       the Log4perl config, in reverse order. A message is printed on "STDERR"
       for each field removed.

       In future this rather dumb logic will be replaced by something smarter.

   utf8
       Switch JSON encoding from ASCII to UTF-8.

   warp_message = 0
       The "warp_message" appender option is used to specify the desired
       behavior for handling log calls with multiple arguments.  The default
       behaviour ("warp_message" not set>) is to concatenate all arguments
       using "join( $Log::Log4perl::JOIN_MSG_ARRAY_CHAR, @log_args )" and
       setting a JSON field "message" to this simple string.

       If, on the other hand, "warp_message = 0" is applied, then for log
       calls with multiple arguments these are considered name/value pairs and
       rendered to a hash-like JSON structure.  For log calls with an odd
       number of arguments (3 or more), the first argument is considered the
       "message" and the others are again considered name/value pairs.

       See "Appenders Expecting Message Chunks" in Log::Log4perl::Appender for
       more info on the configuration option.

   EXAMPLE USING Log::Log4perl::MDC
           local Log::Log4perl::MDC->get_context->{request} = {
               request_uri => $req->request_uri,
               query_parameters => $req->query_parameters
           };

           # ...

           for my $id (@list_of_ids) {

               local Log::Log4perl::MDC->get_context->{id} = $id;

               do_something_useful($id);

           }

       Using code like that shown above, any log messages produced by
       do_something_useful() will automatically include the 'contextual data',
       showing the request URI, the hash of decoded query parameters, and the
       current value of $id.

       If there's a $SIG{__WARN__} handler setup to log warnings via
       "Log::Log4perl" then any warnings from perl, such as uninitialized
       values, will also be logged with this context data included.

       The use of "local" ensures that contextual data doesn't stay in the MDC
       beyond the relevant scope. (For more complex cases you could use
       something like Scope::Guard or simply take care to delete old data.)
