NAME
       Text::Autoformat - Automatic text wrapping and reformatting

VERSION
       This document describes version 1.669006 of Text::Autoformat

SYNOPSIS
        # Minimal use: read from STDIN, format to STDOUT...

           use Text::Autoformat;
           autoformat;

        # In-memory formatting...

           $formatted = autoformat $rawtext;

        # Configuration...

           $formatted = autoformat $rawtext, { %options };

        # Margins (1..72 by default)...

           $formatted = autoformat $rawtext, { left=>8, right=>70 };

        # Justification (left by default)...

           $formatted = autoformat $rawtext, { justify => 'left' };
           $formatted = autoformat $rawtext, { justify => 'right' };
           $formatted = autoformat $rawtext, { justify => 'full' };
           $formatted = autoformat $rawtext, { justify => 'centre' };

        # Filling (does so by default)...

           $formatted = autoformat $rawtext, { fill=>0 };

        # Squeezing whitespace (does so by default)...

           $formatted = autoformat $rawtext, { squeeze=>0 };

        # Select appropriate tabspacing (default is 8 spaces per tab):

           $formatted = autoformat $rawtext, { tabspace=>4 };

        # Case conversions...

           $formatted = autoformat $rawtext, { case => 'lower' };
           $formatted = autoformat $rawtext, { case => 'upper' };
           $formatted = autoformat $rawtext, { case => 'sentence' };
           $formatted = autoformat $rawtext, { case => 'title' };
           $formatted = autoformat $rawtext, { case => 'highlight' };
           $formatted = autoformat $rawtext, { case => \&my_case_func };

        # Selective reformatting

           $formatted = autoformat $rawtext, { ignore=>qr/^\t/ };

BACKGROUND
   The problem
       Perl plaintext formatters just aren't smart enough. Given a typical
       piece of plaintext in need of formatting:

               : Sheesh, what's with this group - ask a question, get toasted! And how
               : *dare* you accuse me of Ianuphilia!

       both the venerable Unix fmt tool and Perl's standard Text::Wrap module
       produce:

               In comp.lang.perl.misc you wrote:  : > <CN = Clooless Noobie>
               writes:  : > CN> PERL sux because:  : > CN>    * It doesn't

       Other formatting modules -- such as Text::Correct and Text::Format --
       provide more control over their output, but produce equally poor
       results when applied to arbitrary input. They simply don't understand
       the structural conventions of the text they're reformatting.

   The solution
       The Text::Autoformat module provides a subroutine named "autoformat"
       that wraps text to specified margins. However, "autoformat" reformats
       its input by analysing the text's structure, so it wraps the above
       example like so:

               In comp.lang.perl.misc you wrote:
               : > <CN = Clooless Noobie> writes:
               : > CN> PERL sux because:
               : > CN>    * It doesn't have a switch statement and you
               : > CN>      have to put $ signs in front of everything
               : > CN>    * There are too many OR operators: having |, ||
               : > CN>      and 'or' operators is confusing
               : > CN>    * VB rools, yeah!!!!!!!!! So anyway, how can I
               : > CN>      stop reloads on a web page? Email replies
               : > CN>      only, thanks - I don't read this newsgroup.
               : >
               : > Begone, sirrah! You are a pathetic, Bill-loving,
               : > microcephalic script-infant.
               : Sheesh, what's with this group - ask a question, get toasted!
               : And how *dare* you accuse me of Ianuphilia!

       Note that the various quoting conventions have been observed. In fact,
       their structure has been used to determine where some paragraphs begin.
       Furthermore "autoformat" correctly distinguished between the leading
       '*' bullets of the nested list (which were outdented) and the leading
       emphatic '*' of "*dare*" (which was inlined).

DESCRIPTION
   Paragraphs
       The fundamental task of the "autoformat" subroutine is to identify and
       rearrange independent paragraphs in a text. Paragraphs typically
       consist of a series of lines containing at least one non-whitespace
       character, followed by one or more lines containing only optional
       whitespace.  This is a more liberal definition than many other
       formatters use: most require an empty line to terminate a paragraph.
       Paragraphs may also be denoted by bulleting, numbering, or quoting (see
       the following sections).

       Once a paragraph has been isolated, "autoformat" fills and re-wraps its
       lines according to the margins that are specified in its argument list.
       These are placed after the text to be formatted, in a hash reference:

               $tidied = autoformat($messy, {left=>20, right=>60});

       By default, "autoformat" uses a left margin of 1 (first column) and a
       right margin of 72.

       You can also control whether (and how) "autoformat" breaks words at the
       end of a line, using the 'break' option:

           # Turn off all hyphenation
           use Text::Autoformat qw(autoformat break_wrap);
               $tidied = autoformat($messy, {break=>break_wrap});

           # Default hyphenation
           use Text::Autoformat qw(autoformat break_at);
               $tidied = autoformat($messy, {break=>break_at('-')});

           # Use TeX::Hyphen module's hyphenation (module must be installed)
           use Text::Autoformat qw(autoformat break_TeX);
               $tidied = autoformat($messy, {break=>break_TeX});

       Normally, "autoformat" only reformats the first paragraph it
       encounters, and leaves the remainder of the text unaltered. This
       behaviour is useful because it allows a one-liner invoking the
       subroutine to be mapped onto a convenient keystroke in a text editor,
       to provide one-paragraph-at-a-time reformatting:

               % cat .exrc

               map f !Gperl -MText::Autoformat -e'autoformat'

       (Note that to facilitate such one-liners, if "autoformat" is called in
       a void context without any text data, it takes its text from "STDIN"
       and writes its result to "STDOUT").

       To enable "autoformat" to rearrange the entire input text at once, the
       "all" argument is used:

               $tidied_all = autoformat($messy, {left=>20, right=>60, all=>1});

       "autoformat" can also be directed to selectively reformat paragraphs,
       using the "ignore" argument:

               $tidied_some = autoformat($messy, {ignore=>qr/^[ \t]/});

       The value for "ignore" may be a "qr"'d regex, a subroutine reference,
       or the special string 'indented'.

       If a regex is specified, any paragraph whose original text matches that
       regex will not be reformatted (i.e. it will be printed verbatim).

       If a subroutine is specified, that subroutine will be called once for
       each paragraph (with $_ set to the paragraph's text). The subroutine is
       expected to return a true or false value. If it returns true, the
       paragraph will not be reformatted.

       If the value of the "ignore" option is the string 'indented',
       "autoformat" will ignore any paragraph in which every line begins with
       a whitespace.

       You may also specify multiple "ignore" options by including them in an
       array-ref:

               $tidied_mesg = autoformat($messy, {ignore=>[qr/1/,'indented']});

       One other special case of ignorance is ignoring mail headers and
       signature.  This option is specified using the "mail" argument:

               $tidied_mesg = autoformat($messy_mesg, {mail=>1});

       Note that the "ignore" or "mail" options automatically imply "all".

   Bulleting and (re-)numbering
       Often plaintext will include lists that are either:

               * bulleted,
               * simply numbered (i.e. 1., 2., 3., etc.), or
               * hierarchically numbered (1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2, 2.1. and so forth).

       In such lists, each bulleted item is implicitly a separate paragraph,
       and is formatted individually, with the appropriate indentation:

               * bulleted,
               * simply numbered (i.e. 1., 2., 3.,
                 etc.), or
               * hierarchically numbered (1, 1.1,
                 1.2, 1.3, 2, 2.1. and so forth).

       More importantly, if the points are numbered, the numbering is checked
       and reordered. For example, a list whose points have been rearranged:

               1. Analyze problem
               3. Design algorithm
               1. Code solution
               5. Test
               4. Ship

       would be renumbered automatically by "autoformat":

               1. Analyze problem
               2. Design algorithm
               3. Code solution
               4. Test
               5. Ship

       The same reordering would be performed if the "numbering" was by
       letters ("a." "b." "c." etc.) or Roman numerals ("i." "ii." "iii.)" or
       by some combination of these ("1a." "1b." "2a." "2b." etc.) Handling
       disordered lists of letters and Roman numerals presents an interesting
       challenge. A list such as:

               A. Put cat in box.
               D. Close lid.
               E. Activate Geiger counter.

       should be reordered as "A." "B." "C.," whereas:

               I. Put cat in box.
               D. Close lid.
               XLI. Activate Geiger counter.

       should be reordered "I." "II." "III."

       The "autoformat" subroutine solves this problem by always interpreting
       alphabetic bullets as being letters, unless the full list consists only
       of valid Roman numerals, at least one of which is two or more
       characters long.

       Note that renumbering starts at the first number actually given, rather
       than restarting at the first possible number. To renumber from 1 (or
       A.) you must change the first numbered bullet to that.

       If automatic renumbering isn't wanted, just specify the 'renumber'
       option with a false value.

       Note that normal numbers above 1000 at the start of a line are no
       longer considered to be paragraph numbering. Numbered paragraphs
       running that high are exceptionally rare, and much rarer than
       paragraphs that look like these:

               Although it has long been popular (especially in the year
               2001) to point out that we now live in the Future, many
               of the promised miracles of Future Life have failed to
               eventuate. This is a new phenomenon (it didn't happen in
               1001) because the idea that the future might be different
               is a new phenomenon.

       which the former numbering rules caused to be formatted like this:

               Although it has long been popular (especially in the year

               2001) to point out that we now live in the Future, many of the
                     promised miracles of Future Life have failed to eventuate.
                     This is a new phenomenon (it didn't happen in

               2002) because the idea that the future might be different is a
                     new phenomenon.

       but which are now formatted:

               Although it has long been popular (especially in the year 2001)
               to point out that we now live in the Future, many of the
               promised miracles of Future Life have failed to eventuate. This
               is a new phenomenon (it didn't happen in 1001) because the idea
               that the future might be different is a new phenomenon.

       If you want numbers less than 1000 (or other characters strings
       currently treated as bullets) to be ignored in this way, you can turn
       of list formatting entirely by setting the 'lists' option to a false
       value.

       You can also select which kinds of lists are recognized, by using a
       string as the value of lists:

           # Don't recognize Roman numerals or alphabetics as list markers...
           autoformat { lists => 'number, bullet' }, $text;

           # Don't recognize bullets or numbers as list markers...
           autoformat { lists => 'roman, alpha' }, $text;

           # Recognize everything except Roman numerals as list markers...
           autoformat { lists => 'number, bullet, alpha' }, $text;

       The string should contain one or more of the following words: "number",
       "bullet", "alpha", "roman". autoformat() will ignore any list type that
       doesn't appear in the 'lists' string.

   Quoting
       Another case in which contiguous lines may be interpreted as belonging
       to different paragraphs, is where they are quoted with distinct
       quoters.  For example:

               : > CN> So anyway, how can I stop reloads on a web page? Email
               : > CN> replies only, thanks - I don't read this newsgroup.
               : > Begone, sirrah! You are a pathetic, Bill-loving,
               : > microcephalic script-infant.
               : Sheesh, what's with this group - ask a question, get toasted!
               : And how *dare* you accuse me of Ianuphilia!

       "autoformat" recognizes the various quoting conventions used in this
       example and treats it as three paragraphs to be independently
       reformatted.

       You may also override the default set of recognized quoters by
       specifying a 'quoter' argument when calling autoformat(). For example,
       to format lines such as:

               // This is a comment
               // in the standard C(++)
               // comment-to-EOL
               // format

       specify:

           autoformat($text, { quoter =E<gt> qr{//})

       Instead of completely replacing the existing set of quoters, you can
       extend them by specifying a pattern that includes the metasequence
       "<QUOTER>", which is then replaced by the module's standard pattern for
       quoters. So, for example, to add "//" to the set of existing quoters:

           autoformat($text, { quoter =E<gt> qr{//|<QUOTER>})

       Block quotations present a different challenge. A typical formatter
       would render the following quotation:

               "We are all of us in the gutter, but some of us are looking at
                the stars"
                                       -- Oscar Wilde

       like so:

               "We are all of us in the gutter, but some of us are looking at
               the stars" -- Oscar Wilde

       "autoformat" recognizes the quotation structure by matching the
       following regular expression against the text component of each
       paragraph:

               / \A(\s*) # leading whitespace for quotation (["']|``) # opening
               quotemark (.*) # quotation (''|\2) # closing quotemark \s*?\n #
               trailing whitespace after quotation (\1[ ]+) # leading
               whitespace for attribution
                                       #   (must be indented more than
                                       #   quotation)
                 (--|-) # attribution introducer ([^\n]*?\n) # first
                 attribution line ((\5[^\n]*?$)*) # other attribution lines
                                       #   (indented no less than first line)
                 \s*\Z # optional whitespace to end of paragraph /xsm

       When reformatted (see below), the indentation and the attribution
       structure will be preserved:

               "We are all of us in the gutter, but some of us are looking
                at the stars"
                                       -- Oscar Wilde

   Widow control
       Note that in the last example, "autoformat" broke the line at column
       68, four characters earlier than it should have. It did so because, if
       the full margin width had been used, the formatting would have left the
       last two words by themselves on an oddly short last line:

               "We are all of us in the gutter, but some of us are looking at
               the stars"

       This phenomenon is known as "widowing" and is heavily frowned upon in
       typesetting circles. It looks ugly in plaintext too, so "autoformat"
       avoids it by stealing extra words from earlier lines in a paragraph, so
       as to leave enough for a reasonable last line. The heuristic used is
       that final lines must be at least 10 characters long (though this
       number may be adjusted by passing a "widow => minlength" argument to
       "autoformat").

       If the last line is too short, the paragraph's right margin is reduced
       by one column, and the paragraph is reformatted. This process iterates
       until either the last line exceeds nine characters or the margins have
       been narrowed by 10% of their original separation. In the latter case,
       the reformatter gives up and uses its original formatting.

   Justification
       The "autoformat" subroutine also takes a named argument: "{justify =>
       type}", which specifies how each paragraph is to be justified.  The
       options are: 'left' (the default), "'right'," 'centre' (or 'center'),
       and 'full'. These act on the complete paragraph text (but not on any
       quoters before that text). For example, with 'right' justification:

               R3>     Now is the Winter of our discontent made
               R3> glorious Summer by this son of York. And all
               R3> the clouds that lour'd upon our house In the
               R3>              deep bosom of the ocean buried.

       Full justification is interesting in a fixed-width medium like
       plaintext because it usually results in uneven spacing between words.
       Typically, formatters provide this by distributing the extra spaces
       into the first available gaps of each line:

               R3> Now  is  the  Winter  of our discontent made
               R3> glorious Summer by this son of York. And all
               R3> the  clouds  that  lour'd  upon our house In
               R3> the deep bosom of the ocean buried.

       This produces a rather jarring visual effect, so "autoformat" reverses
       the strategy and inserts extra spaces at the end of lines:

               R3> Now is the  Winter of  our  discontent  made

       Most readers find this less disconcerting.

   Implicit centring
       Even if explicit centring is not specified, "autoformat" will attempt
       to automatically detect centred paragraphs and preserve their
       justification. It does this by examining each line of the paragraph and
       asking: "if this line were part of a centred paragraph, where would the
       centre line have been?"

       The answer can be determined by adding the length of leading whitespace
       before the first word, plus half the length of the full set of words on
       the line. That is, for a single line:

               $line =~ /^(\s*)(.*?)(\s*)$/ $centre =
               length($1)+0.5*length($2);

       By making the same estimate for every line, and then comparing the
       estimates, it is possible to deduce whether all the lines are centred
       with respect to the same axis of symmetry (with an allowance of ±1 to
       cater for the inevitable rounding when the centre positions of even-
       length rows were originally computed). If a common axis of symmetry is
       detected, "autoformat" assumes that the lines are supposed to be
       centred, and switches to centre-justification mode for that paragraph.

       Note that this behaviour can to switched off entirely by setting the
       "autocentre" argument false.

   Case transformations
       The "autoformat" subroutine can also optionally perform case
       conversions on the text it processes. The "{case => type}" argument
       allows the user to specify six different conversions:

       'upper'
           This mode unconditionally converts every letter in the reformatted
           text to upper-case;

       'lower'
           This mode unconditionally converts every letter in the reformatted
           text to lower-case;

       'sentence'
           This mode attempts to generate correctly-cased sentences from the
           input text. That is, the first letter after a sentence-terminating
           punctuator is converted to upper-case. Then, each subsequent word
           in the sentence is converted to lower-case, unless that word is
           originally mixed-case or contains punctuation. For example, under
           "{case => 'sentence'}":

                   'POVERTY, MISERY, ETC. are the lot of the PhD candidate. alas!'

           becomes:

                   'Poverty, misery, etc. are the lot of the PhD candidate. Alas!'

           Note that "autoformat" is clever enough to recognize that the
           period after abbreviations such as "etc." is not a sentence
           terminator.

           If the argument is specified as 'sentence ' (with one or more
           trailing whitespace characters) those characters are used to
           replace the single space that appears at the end of the sentence.
           For example, "autoformat($text, {case=>'sentence '}") would
           produce:

                   'Poverty, misery, etc. are the lot of the PhD candidate. Alas!'

       'title'
           This mode behaves like 'sentence' except that the first letter of
           every word is capitalized:

                   'What I Did On My Summer Vacation In Monterey'

       'highlight'
           This mode behaves like 'title' except that trivial words are not
           capitalized:

                   'What I Did on my Summer Vacation in Monterey'

       "sub{...}"
           If the argument for 'case' is a subroutine reference, that
           subroutine is applied to each word and the result replaces the word
           in the text.

           For example, to convert a string to hostage-case:

               my $ransom_note = sub {
                   return join "",                    # ^  Reconcatenate
                          map {/[aeiou]/i ? lc : uc}  # |  uPPeR aND LoWeR each
                          split //,                   # |  Break into chars
                          shift;                      # |  Take argument
               };

               $text = autoformat($text, {case => $ransom_note });
               # "FoR eXaMPLe, To CoNVeRT a STRiNG To HoSTaGe-CaSe:"

           Or to highlight particular words:

               my @SPECIAL = qw( perl camel wall );
               sub highlight_specials {
                   my ($word) = @_;
                   return $word ~~ @SPECIAL ? uc($word) : $word;
               }

               $text = autoformat($text, {case => \&highlight_specials});
               # "It is easier for a CAMEL to pass through a WALL of PERL..."

   Selective reformatting
       You can select which paragraphs "autoformat" actually reformats (or,
       rather, those it doesn't reformat) using the "ignore" flag.

       For example:

               # Reformat all paras except those containing "verbatim"...
               print autoformat { all => 1, ignore => qr/verbatim/i }, $text;

               # Reformat all paras except those less that 3 lines long...
               print autoformat { all => 1, ignore => sub { tr/\n/\n/ < 3
               } }, $text;

               # Reformat all paras except those that are indented...
               print autoformat { all => 1, ignore => qr/^\s/m }, $text;

               # Reformat all paras except those that are indented (easier)...
               print autoformat { all => 1, ignore => 'indented' }, $text;

   Handling tabs
       Text::Autoformat replaces any tabs in the text it's formatting with the
       appropriate number of spaces (using Text::Tabs to do its dirty work).
       It normally assumes that each tab is equivalent to 8 space characters,
       but you can change that default using the 'tabspace' option:

               print autoformat { tabspace => 4 }, $text;
