NAME
       StackTrace::Auto - a role for generating stack traces during
       instantiation

VERSION
       version 1.001

SYNOPSIS
       First, include StackTrace::Auto in a Moose or Mooclass...

         package Some::Class;
         # NOTE: Moo can also be used here instead of Moose
         use Moose;
         with 'StackTrace::Auto';

       ...then create an object of that class...

         my $obj = Some::Class->new;

       ...and now you have a stack trace for the object's creation.

         print $obj->stack_trace->as_string;

PERL VERSION
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It
       should work on any version of perl released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made
       that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version
       may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

ATTRIBUTES
   stack_trace
       This attribute will contain an object representing the stack at the
       point when the error was generated and thrown.  It must be an object
       performing the "as_string" method.

   stack_trace_class
       This attribute may be provided to use an alternate class for stack
       traces.  The default is Devel::StackTrace.

       In general, you will not need to think about this attribute.

   stack_trace_args
       This attribute is an arrayref of arguments to pass when building the
       stack trace.  In general, you will not need to think about it.
