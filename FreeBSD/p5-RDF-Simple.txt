NAME
       RDF::Simple - read and write RDF without complication

DESCRIPTION
       This package is for very simple manipulations of RDF/XML serialisations
       of RDF graphs.  It consists of:

           RDF::Simple::Parser
           RDF::Simple::Serialiser

       Please consult the individual pod for these packages.  The parser
       requires XML::SAX

       Also provided is RDF::Simple::NS, a utility class for XML namespaces in
       RDF

       The aim here is to keep things Simple: e.g., the parser doesn't
       differentiate between literal and resource values in the model.  All
       you get back is a bucket-o-triples (array of arrays)

       Use the parser to read RDF that you recieve.

       The serialiser does its best to do DWYM.  Use the serialiser to build
       RDF to send to others.

       If you want a more complex and involved RDF API, I'd suggest looking at
       RDF::Core or at the Attean Semantic web framework at
       http://metacpan.org/pod/Attean

       Please report bugs via RT at
