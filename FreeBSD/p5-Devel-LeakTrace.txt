NAME
       Devel::LeakTrace - indicate where leaked variables are coming from.

SYNOPSIS
         perl -MDevel::LeakTrace -e '{ my $foo; $foo = \$foo }'
         leaked SV(0x528d0) from -e line 1
         leaked SV(0x116a10) from -e line 1

DESCRIPTION
       Based heavily on Devel::Leak, Devel::LeakTrace uses the pluggable
       runops feature found in perl 5.6 and later in order to trace SV
       allocations of a running program.

       At END time Devel::LeakTrace identifies any remaining variables, and
       reports on the lines in which the came into existence.

       Note that by default state is first recorded during the INIT phase.  As
       such the module will not pay attention to any scalars created during
       BEGIN time.  This is intentional as symbol table aliasing is never
       released before the END times and this is most common in the implicit
       BEGIN blocks of "use" statements.

CAVEATS
       glib <http://developer.gnome.org/glib/> is used for it's hash
       manipulation routines to keep state.  This is an external dependency
       that is hoped can be removed, but tuits as yet haven't presented
       themselves.

TODO
       Elminate dependency on glib

       Improve the documentation.
