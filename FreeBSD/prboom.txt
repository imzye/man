BOOM.CFG(5)               FreeBSD File Formats Manual              BOOM.CFG(5)



NAME
       boom.cfg, glboom.cfg - Configuration file for PrBoom v2.1.0 onwards

USAGE
       When a version of PrBoom is run, it  searches for this configuration
       file to modify its default settings.  Every time PrBoom exits, it
       rewrites the configuration file, updating any settings that have been
       changed using the in-game menus.

       PrBoom expects the config file to be  ~/.prboom/boom.cfg, or
       ~/.prboom/glboom.cfg if compiled with GL support. Alternatively, it can
       be made to look elsewhere by using a command-line parameter:

       {prboom,glboom} [-config myconf]

FORMAT
       boom.cfg consists of a number of variables and values. Each line is of
       the following format:

       [ { {{#,;,[} comment_text , variable {decimal_integer, 0x hex_integer,
       "string_text"}}]

       Any line beginning with a non-alphabetic character is treated as a
       comment and ignored; for future compatibility you should start comments
       with a #, ; or [.  Note however that when PrBoom rewrites boom.cfg it
       does not preserve user added comments.

       Any line beginning with an alphabetic character is treated as a
       variable-value pair.  The first word (sequence of non-whitespace
       characters) is the variable name, and everything after the following
       block of whitespace is taken to be the value assigned to the variable.

       Variables not recognised by PrBoom, or which are given an invalid value
       or a value of an inappropriate type, are ignored. Warning messages are
       given where relevant.

       The variables recognised by PrBoom are described per-section in the
       following sections. The sections are informal however; when PrBoom
       rewrites the config file it writes in section headings and puts
       variables into the relevant sections, but when reading these are
       ignored.


MISC SETTINGS
       compatibility_level
              PrBoom is capable of behaving in a way compatible with earlier
              versions of Doom and Boom/PrBoom. The value given here selects
              the version to be compatible with when doing new games/demos.
              See README.compat for details.

       realtic_clock_rate
              Selects the speed that PrBoom runs at, as a percentage of normal
              game speed.  Leave at 0 unless you want to experiment. Note that
              it is considered `cheating' to use this at any setting below 0
              (or above?).

       max_player_corpse
              Sets the maximum number of player corpses to leave lying around.
              If this limit would be exceeded, an old corpse is removed.
              Useful for big/long Deathmatch games, where the sheer number of
              corpses could slow the game down.

       flashing_hom
              Flag indicating whether a flashing red background is drawn to
              highlight HOM errors in levels (for level developers)

       demo_insurance
              Selects a method of protecting demos against `going out of sync'
              (where the player seems to lose control and behave madly, but in
              fact the players original instructions as stored in the demo
              have got out of sync with the game he was playing). 0=No
              protection, 1=Full protection, 2=Only while recording demos.
              Safest when left set to 2.

       endoom_mode
              This parameter specifies options controlling the display of the
              credits screen when Doom exits. Currently it is the sum of 3
              options: add 1 for colours, 2 for non-ASCII characters to be
              displayed, and 4 for the last line to be skipped so the top line
              doesn't scroll off screen.

       level_precache
              If set, when loading a new level PrBoom precaches all the
              graphics the level is likely to need in memory. This makes it
              much slower to load the level, but reduces disk activity and
              slowdowns reading data during play. Most systems are fast enough
              that precaching is not needed.


FILES SETTINGS
       wadfile_1, wadfile_2
              The names of 2 .wad files to be automatically loaded when PrBoom
              is started.  A blank string means unused.


       dehfile_1, dehfile_2
              The names of 2 patch files (.deh or .bex) to be automatically
              loaded when PrBoom is started (empty string for none).


GAME SETTINGS
       default_skill
              The default skill level when starting a new game.

       weapon_recoil
              Enables recoil from weapon fire.

       doom_weapon_toggles
              Flag indicating whether pressing 3 or 1 when that weapon is
              already selected causes the selected shotgun or fist/chainsaw to
              be toggled, as in original Doom. Some people prefer to use a
              number for each weapon alone.

       player_bobbing
              Enables player bobbing (view randomly moving up/down slightly as
              the player runs).

       monsters_remember
              Makes monsters remember their previous enemy after killing their
              current target.

       monster_infighting
              Whether monsters will fight each other when they injure each
              other accidentally.

       monster_backing
              Whether monsters without close combat weapons will back away
              from close combat (unlike original Doom).

       monster_avoid_hazards
              Whether monsters avoid crushing ceilings.

       monkeys
              Whether monsters will climb steep stairs.

       monster_friction
              Whether monsters are affected by changed floor friction (they
              should be, but weren't in Boom)

       help_friends
              Whether monsters will help out injured monsters by aiding them
              against their attacker.

       player_helpers
              The number of helper dogs to spawn.

       friend_distance
              Distance within which friends will generally stay.

       dog_jumping
              Whether dogs will jump.

       sts_always_red
              PrBoom can make the colour of the text displays on the status
              bar reflect your current status (red=low, yellow=average,
              green=good, blue=super-charged).  This option if set selects the
              traditional Doom behavior of always-red status bar display; set
              to 0 to allow the coloured display.

       sts_pct_always_gray
              See above, this makes just the percent signs always gray,
              instead of changing colour.

       sts_traditional_keys
              Doom and PrBoom have two types of keys; PrBoom will normally
              display both keys of a given colour if you have both. This
              option, if enabled, instead makes PrBoom only ever display one
              key of each colour, in the same way Doom did.

       traditional_menu
              Changes PrBoom's menu ordering to be the same as original Doom
              if enabled.

       show_messages
              When enabled, text messages are displayed in the top left corner
              of the screen describing events in the game. Can be toggled in
              the game, this is just to preserve the setting.

       autorun
              Makes the player always run, without having to hold down a run
              key. Can be toggled in the game, this just preserves the
              setting.


SOUND SETTINGS
       sound_card
              Selects whether sound effects are enabled (non-zero enables).
              For compatibility reasons with Boom, a range of values are
              accepted.

       music_card
              Selects whether in-game music is enabled (non-zero enables). For
              compatibility reasons a range of values are accepted.

       pitched_sounds
              If enabled by this variable, this enables `pitching' (making
              pitch adjustments to the playing sounds) for 16 bit sound cards.

       samplerate
              The samplerate for soundmixing and timidity. The sound quality
              is much better at higher samplerates, but if you use timidity
              then higher samplerates need much more CPU power. Useful values
              are 11025, 22050, 44100 and 48000.

       sfx_volume
              Sound effects volume. This is best adjusted in the game.

       music_volume
              Music volume. This is best adjusted in the game.

       mus_pause_opt
              Selects what PrBoom does to the music when a games is paused.
              0=stop the music, 1=pause the music (stop it playing, but when
              resumed resume it at the same place - not implemented),
              2=continue playing.

       sounddev, snd_channels, soundsrv, musicsrv
              These variables are no longer used by PrBoom, but are kept for
              compatibility reasons.


COMPATIBILITY SETTINGS
       These are settings that let you choose whether the normal game
       mechanics are used, or whether various quirks, bugs and limitations of
       the original Doom game are emulated.


VIDEO SETTINGS
       screen_width, screen_height
              For versions of PrBoom which support high-res, these specify the
              default screen or window size for PrBoom. These settings are
              ignored and preserved by versions of PrBoom which do not do
              high-res (they assume 320x200).

       use_fullscreen
              If set, this causes PrBoom to try to go full screen. Depending
              on your video driver and mode, this may include changing screen
              resolution to better match the game's screen resolution.

       use_doublebuffer
              Use double buffering to reduce tearing. On some machines this is
              even faster than the normal method, but on others this makes
              problems, so you have to try out which setting works best.

       translucency
              Causes PrBoom to display certain objects as translucent.

       tran_filter_pct
              Selects how translucent objects are when they are translucent.
              Play with this and see for yourself.

       screenblocks
              Selects a reduced screen size inside the PrBoom window (the
              player's view is surrounded by a border). Normally this is
              undesirable, but it can help speed up the game. Can be changed
              in the game with the +/- keys, this variable is just to preserve
              that setting.

       usegamma
              Selects a level of gamma correction (extra screen brightening)
              to correct for a dark monitor or light surroundings. Can be
              selected in the game with the F11 key, this config entry
              preserves that setting.


OPENGL SETTINGS
       If you are knowledgeable about OpenGL, you can tweak various aspects of
       the GL rendering engine.

       gl_nearclip
              The near clipping plane *100.

       gl_colorbuffer_bits
              The bit depth for the framebuffer. (16, 24 or 32 bits)

       gl_depthbuffer_bits
              The bit depth for the z-buffer. (16, 24 or 32 bits)

       gl_tex_filter_string
              A string, one of the following: GL_NEAREST or GL_LINEAR (no
              mipmapping), or one of GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST,
              GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR, GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_NEAREST,
              GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR with mipmapping.

       gl_tex_format_string
              One of the following strings: GL_RGBA - means format selected by
              driver (not so good), GL_RGBA2 - means 2 bits for each component
              (bad), GL_RGBA4 - means 4 bits for each component (like GL_RGBA
              on most cards), GL_RGB5_A1 - means 5 bits for each color
              component 1 bit for the alpha channel (default), GL_RGBA8 -
              means 8 bits for each component (best quality, but only a little
              bit better than GL_RGB5_A1 and slower on most cards)

       gl_drawskys
              If 0, disables drawing skies, which may be needed with some
              problematic 3D cards.

       gl_sortsprites
              Experimental option, possibly faster but less reliable.


MOUSE SETTINGS
       This section specifies settings for using a mouse with PrBoom. There
       are several settings that control button bindings (what action each
       button causes in the game); these are easiest set from the in-game
       menus, these config entries are to preserve the settings between games.

       use_mouse
              Enable or disable the use of a mouse with PrBoom.

       mouse_sensitivity_horiz, mouse_sensitivity_vert
              Sets the sensitivity of the mouse in PrBoom. Easier set from the
              in-game menus.


KEY BINDINGS
       These specify the keys that trigger various actions in PrBoom. The
       codes used for keys are internal to PrBoom, though many keys are
       represented by their ASCII codes. It is easiest to modify these via the
       in-game menus (OPTIONS->SETUP->KEY BINDINGS). These config file entries
       preserve the settings from this menu between game sessions.


JOYSTICK SETTINGS
       There are the trigger variables here, which are calculated during
       joystick calibration (the values received from the kernel driver
       outside of which movement is caused in the game). Also there are the
       button-bindings, again best adjusted using the in-game menus.

       use_joystick
              This selects the number of the joystick to use, or 0 selects no
              joystick. You have to have the relevant device files (/dev/js0
              etc) and the kernel driver loaded.


CHAT MACROS
       These are pre-written text strings for quick transmission to players in
       a network game (consult your Doom documentation). Easiest set via the
       in-game menus (OPTIONS->SETUP->CHAT MACROS).


AUTOMAP SETTINGS
       These are settings related to the automap. These are easiest set from
       within the game.


HEADS_UP DISPLAY SETTINGS
       These are settings related to the heads-up display, that is messages
       received while playing and the heads-up display of your current status
       obtained by pressing + while the view is full-screen in PrBoom. See the
       Boom documentation for details. All controlled best from within the
       game.


WEAPON PREFERENCES
       Here are the settings from the Weapons menu in the game
       (OPTIONS->SETUP->WEAPONS).
