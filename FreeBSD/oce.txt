NAME
     oce – Device driver for Emulex OneConnect 10Gb network adapters

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device pci
           device oce

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_oce_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     Emulex OneConnect adapters come in various skews and with different
     combinations of NIC, FCoE and iSCSI functions.  The oce driver claims the
     NIC functions in all these adapters.

     The oce driver supports VLAN Hardware offload, TCP checksum offload, TCP
     segmentation offload (TSO), Large receive offload (LRO), Bonding, Jumbo
     frames (from 1500 - 9000), Multiple TX queues, Receive-Side Scaling (RSS)
     and MSI-X interrupts.

HARDWARE
     The oce driver supports the following network adapters:

     •   Emulex BladeEngine 2
     •   Emulex BladeEngine 3
     •   Emulex Lancer

UPDATING FIRMWARE
     Adapter firmware updates are persistent.

     Firmware can be updated by following the steps below:

     1.   Copy the below code to a Makefile:

                KMOD=elxflash
                FIRMWS=imagename.ufi:elxflash
                .include <bsd.kmod.mk>

     2.   Replace imagename in above with UFI file name

     3.   Copy Makefile and UFI file to a directory

     4.   Execute make & copy generated elxflash.ko to /lib/modules

     5.   sysctl dev.oce.<if_id>.fw_upgrade=elxflash

     6.   Reboot the machine

     In case of issues with supplied UFI, flashing fails with one of the
     following errors.

     1.   "Invalid BE3 firmware image"
     2.   "Invalid Cookie. Firmware image corrupted ?"
     3.   "cmd to write to flash rom failed."
