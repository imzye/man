NAME
     greylite – transparent greylisting module for mailservers

SYNOPSIS
     greylite [smtpd-child]

DESCRIPTION
     greylite is an implementation of a modified greylisting technology for
     fighting SPAM on mailservers. It combines natively with qmail and works
     as a proxy for any SMTP server.

     The prevalent reference for greylite is the web page at
     http://mij.oltrelinux.com/net/greylite/; this man page is a shorter
     reference.

     This man page explains how to setup and use greylite, not how to install
     it, nor its internals, nor its distinguishable features.

     For setup instructions, see SETUP below. For a quick reference on control
     variables, see CONTROLS below. For an outline of the algorithm with which
     greylist modified the delivery attempts, see ALGORITHM below.

SETUP
     Both when running as a reverse SMTP proxy or a UCSPI wrapper, greylite is
     run under tcpserver (see http://cr.yp.to/ucspi-tcp/tcpserver.html).

     The database file must be created first in either case, with the file
     greydb.sql from the greylite's package (installing from package managers
     could already provide this database):

           mkdir -p /var/db/greylite
           sqlite3 -init greydb.sql /var/db/greylite/greylite.db

     Thereafter greylite can immediately be run from a tcpserver instance,
     either as proxy or as wrapper.

     When run as a reverse SMTP proxy, greylite stays in the middle of the
     connection between the client and the upstream server, supervises the
     envelope session transparently and decides how to act depending on its
     modified greylisting algorithm. In this case, the ucspi2socket module is
     used to communicate with the upstream server:

           /usr/local/bin/tcpserver -v -R -l `uname -n` BINDADDR BINDPORT \
               env GREYLIST="" /usr/local/bin/greylite \
               /usr/local/bin/ucspi2socket SRVADDR [SRVPORT]
     replace BINDADDR and BINDPORT with the IP address and port that greylite
     must listen; replace SRVADDR (and SRVPORT if you need it) with the IP
     address and port of the upstream "true" SMTP server to defend.

     When run as a UCSPI (notably, qmail) wrapper, greylite is just plugged
     into the top of the tcpserver chain preceding qmail-smtpd. A typical
     chain (as taken from http://lifewithqmail.org/lwq.html#supervise-tree)
     modified to enable greylite looks like:

           /usr/local/bin/tcpserver -v -R -l "$LOCAL" \
               -x /etc/tcp.smtp.cdb -c "$MAXSMTPD" \
               -u "$QMAILDUID" -g "$NOFILESGID" 0 smtp \
               /usr/local/bin/greylite /var/qmail/bin/qmail-smtpd 2>&1
     where the greylite executable is evidently inserted without further
     complications.

     Unless the GREYLIST environment variable in detected by greylite, it
     passes transparently to the upstream server. This variable - as well as
     other control variables, possibly - can be passed with the tcpserver's
     control access feature (-x file option).  Based on a rule file, it can
     both allow/deny connections and specify environment variables per-source-
     address. A rule file allowing everyone in and passing the GREYLIST
     variable looks like:

           :allow,GREYLIST=""
     See http://cr.yp.to/ucspi-tcp/tcpserver.html and
     http://cr.yp.to/ucspi-tcp/tcprules.html for more information.

     If greylite runs as unprivileged user (-u and/or -g arguments to
     tcpserver), make sure that the directory holding the .db file is writable
     by such user.  Using custom paths or filenames for this database is also
     possible (see CONTROLS below).

CONTROLS
     greylite is controlled exclusively by environment variables. No command
     line options are required nor allowed.

     greylite recognizes the following environment variables:
     GREYLIST
             if not set, greylisting is disabled and control is passed
             immediately to the smtpd transparently. If set, greylisting
             mediation is enabled. Besides existence, the value assigned to
             this variable is completely ignored.
     DBFILE  if set, its value indicates the full path to the database file to
             use. If not set, the default filename
             /var/db/greylite/greylite.db is used.
     LOGTHRESHOLD
             if set to an integer between 0 (LOG_EMERG) and 7 (LOG_DEBUG), log
             messages with priority strictly lower than this value are not
             reported. Otherwise, the default threshold is 3 (LOG_ERR).
     LOGPID  if set, every log message will be prepended by the PID of the
             process writing it.
     SUSPICION
             if set, its value indicates the full path to the suspicion file.
             See SUSPICION below.
     GEOIPDB_FILE
             when using suspicion with GeoIP rules, the value of this variable
             is the full path and filename of the GeoIP database. If not set,
             greylite will look for /usr/local/share/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat.
     GREETDELAY
             when set, greylite opens the connection immediately but
             introduces a small delay (by default 6 seconds) before actually
             responding data to the client. If its value is a positive
             integer, it represents a custom delay to wait, in millisecs.

SUSPICION
     Greylisting has a tremendous effectiveness and efficiency but can be
     easily worked around, for example issuing the delivery twice (or thrice)
     in case of temporary error.

     However, it can be frequently inferred with some accuracy that a client
     is a spammer by a bunch of factors. For example, if the address' hostname
     contains "ppp", or "dynamic" it is likely to be spammer; if it attempts
     twice immediately, if it is located in countries like Russia or China or
     Malaysia etc, if it connects and pushes data without waiting the server
     responses et cetera, these are all distinguishable properties of
     spammers.

     "Suspicion" is a technique used by greylite to avoid the workarounds that
     spammers use against greylisting. It is a list of rules to determine if
     the client has to be required multiple delivery attempts (instead of the
     usual double attempt): the more suspicious is a client, the more times it
     might be temporarily rejected. Also, clients resulting suspicious are not
     whitelisted even if they pass the greylisting challenge.

     A complete reference for greylite's suspicion is available in
     http://mij.oltrelinux.com/net/greylite/suspicion.html.

     This suspicion policy is contained in a suspicion file.  In this text
     file, each line has format "number letter rule" (or "number letter !
     rule"), where:
           number  is a positive integer value defining the number of delivery
                   attempts to require for the message if the rule matches
           letter  is a lowercase letter specifying the type of the rule
                   following (see below)
           !       if present, inverts (negates) the specification of the rule
                   -- that is, matches when the rule does not and vice-versa
           rule    is the rule specification
     Lines whose first character is '#' are ignored. The first line whose rule
     matches decides the number of attempts to require.

     The following kinds of rules are currently supported:
           r       Reverse lookup. The rule is an extended regular expression
                   (see re_format(7)) to check the PTR domain of the client
                   address. If the regex matches the PTR domain, the rule is
                   applied. This kind of rule requires tcpserver to be run
                   with the -r command line option so that the remote host
                   name is available to greylite.
           v       environment Variable. The rule is a space-separated list of
                   one or more environment variables. If any of these
                   variables is present in the process' environment, the rule
                   is applied. If the value of the variable is a positive
                   integer, that will be used as number of attempts instead of
                   the number in the rule.
           e       Envelope analysis. The rule is a list of one or more
                   patterns to match against parts of the envelope
                   information. Patterns are expressed as regular expressions
                   (see re_format(7)) prefixed by "r:", "s:" or "h:" for
                   matching respectively the envelope recipient, the envelope
                   sender or the hostname sent in the HELO/EHLO command.
           g       GeoIP. The rule is a space-separated list of one or more
                   country codes, see http://www.maxmind.com/app/iso3166.  If
                   the client appears to come from a zone in this list, the
                   rule is applied.  This kind requires greylite to be
                   compiled with "-DWITH_GEOIP", and that the GeoIP library
                   and database are present in the system (see GEOIPDB_FILE in
                   CONTROLS above).
           b       client Behaviour. If the client features certain
                   behaviours, the rule is applied. Behaviours are specified
                   as list of one or more keywords: "greetdelay" (a delay is
                   inserted before passing data when the connection is open.
                   Mass mailers may give up and disconnect, or send data
                   blindly before expecting the server's greeting. In the
                   second case the rule matches.); "retryinterval" (the client
                   may be retrying deliveries of the message with an excessive
                   frequency that is not proper of legitimate servers.);
                   "commanderrors" (the client issued a command that the
                   server did not accept during the command session. Use with
                   caution)
     Lines with an unknown kind are ignored. Lines with an incorrect format
     are discarded.

     This is an example:

     # unprotecteddomain.com is not protected with greylisting, and GMX is
     # trusted because of SPF's "-all"
     0 e r:@unprotecteddomain.com$ s:@gmx.(de|net)$
     # who fails the greetdelay trap or retries blindly is rejected to the infinite
     100 b greetdelay retryinterval
     # dnsblenv sets the BLACKLISTED variable when the client is on a RBL
     6 v BLACKLISTED
     # clients outside this zone are suspicious (this is very case-specific)
     3 g ! AT BE CH DE ES EU FI FR GB IT MC NO SM VA
     # clients whose PTR name contains "dynamic" stuff are suspicious
     3 r (^|[^a-z])(a?dsl|dyn(amic)?(ip)?|dial(in|up)?|ppp|customer|user|host|home)([^a-z]|.?$)
     2 r (([0-9]{1,3}[-.]){3})[0-9]{1,3}

MODULES
     Greylite can be interfaced with more modules. Pre-modules are run before
     greylite and can perform custom checks on the client and set environment
     variables to which greylite can be made sensible for suspicion. Post-
     modules are run after greylite and can make greylite communicate with
     backend servers.  Every module must conform to the UCSPI interface to be
     compatible with the rest of the "service chain".

     Two modules are included in the distribution: dnsblenv and ucspi2socket.

     dnsblenv is a pre-module. It queries a list of RBL/DNSBL lists (space-
     separated into the DNSBL environment variable) for the client's address.
     If it is found in any of them, it sets the BLACKLISTED environment
     variable and runs its argument.

     ucspi2socket is a post-module. It is run conforming to the UCSPI
     interface for interfacing with an upstream TCP server.

     This is an example combining both modules: dnsblenv polling lists
     zen.spamhaus.org and dnsbl.sorbs.net; ucspi2socket connecting to the
     upstream server 1.2.3.4 on port 43210:

           /usr/local/bin/tcpserver -v -R -l `uname -n` BINDADDR BINDPORT \\
               env GREYLIST="" DNSBL="zen.spamhaus.org dnsbl.sorbs.net" \\
               /usr/local/bin/dnsblenv /usr/local/bin/greylite \\
               /usr/local/bin/ucspi2socket 1.2.3.4 43210

ALGORITHM
     The original greylisting algorithm is described in
     http://projects.puremagic.com/greylisting/ and the modified algorithm
     used by greylite is outlined below and detailed in
