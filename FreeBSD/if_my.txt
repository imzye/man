NAME
     my – Myson Technology Ethernet PCI driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following line in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device my

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_my_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The my driver provides support for various NICs based on the Myson
     chipset.  The Myson chipset is a variant of the DEC Tulip NIC chipset.

     The driver will work with almost any MII-compliant PHY, thus failure to
     positively identify the chip is not a fatal error.

     chipset.  Supported models include:

     •   Myson MTD800 PCI Fast Ethernet chip
     •   Myson MTD803 PCI Fast Ethernet chip
     •   Myson MTD89X PCI Gigabit Ethernet chip
