BUS_SET_RESOURCE(9)    FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual   BUS_SET_RESOURCE(9)

NAME
     bus_set_resource – associate a definite resource with a given resource ID

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <sys/bus.h>

     #include <machine/bus.h>
     #include <sys/rman.h>
     #include <machine/resource.h>

     int
     bus_set_resource(device_t dev, int type, int rid, rman_res_t start,
         rman_res_t count);

DESCRIPTION
     The bus_set_resource() function sets the start address of the resource
     type, rid pair to be count long.  Typically, client drivers do not use
     this interface.  Bus drivers, however, often use it to set up the
     resources a client driver uses.

     The arguments are as follows:

     dev     The device to set the resource on.

     type    The type of resource you want to allocate.  It is one of:

             SYS_RES_IRQ         for IRQs
             SYS_RES_DRQ         for ISA DMA lines
             SYS_RES_IOPORT      for I/O ports
             SYS_RES_MEMORY      for I/O memory

     rid     A bus-specific handle that identifies the resource being
             allocated.

     start   The start address of this resource.

     count   The length of the resource.  For example, the size of the memory
             in bytes.

RETURN VALUES
     Zero is returned on success, otherwise an error is returned.
