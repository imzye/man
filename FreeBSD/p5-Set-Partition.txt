NAME
       Set::Partition - Enumerate all arrangements of a set in fixed subsets

VERSION
       This document describes version 0.03 of Set::Partition, released
       2006-10-11.

SYNOPSIS
         use Set::Partition;

         my $s = Set::Partition->new(
           list      => [qw(a b c d e)],
           partition => [2, 3],
         );
         while (my $p = $s->next) {
           print join( ' ', map { "(@$_)" } @$p ), $/;
         }
         # produces
         (a b) (c d e)
         (a c) (b d e)
         (a d) (b c e)
         (a e) (b c d)
         (b c) (a d e)
         (b d) (a c e)
         (b e) (a c d)
         (c d) (a b e)
         (c e) (a b d)
         (d e) (a b c)

         # or with a hash
         my $s = Set::Partition->new(
           list      => { b => 'bat', c => 'cat', d => 'dog' },
           partition => [2, 1],
         );
         while (my $p = $s->next) {
           ...
         }

DESCRIPTION
       "Set::Partition" takes a list or hash of elements  and a list numbers
       that represent the sizes of the partitions into which the list of
       elements should be arranged.

       The resulting object can then be used as an iterator which returns a
       reference to an array of lists, that represents the original list
       arranged according to the given partitioning. All possible arrangements
       are returned, and the object returns "undef" when the entire
       combination space has been exhausted.

METHODS
       new     Creates a new "Set::Partition" object. A set of key/value
               parameters can be supplied to control the finer details of the
               object's behaviour.

               list, the list of elements in the set.

               partition, the list of integers representing the size of the
               partitions used to arrange the set. The sum should be equal to
               the number of elements given by list. If it less than the
               number of elements, a dummy partition will be added to equalise
               the count.  This partition will be returned during iteration.
               If the sum is greater than the number of elements, new() will
               "croak" with a fatal error.

       next    Returns the next arrangement of subsets, or "undef" when all
               arrangements have been enumerated.

       reset   Resets the object, which causes it to enumerate the
               arrangements from the beginning.

                 $p->reset; # begin again

DIAGNOSTICS
   sum of partitions (%d) exceeds available elements (%d)
       A list of partition sizes (for instance, 2, 3, 4) was given, along with
       a list to partition (for instance, containing 8 elements), however, the
       number of elements required to fill the different partitions (9)
       exceeds the number available in the source list (8).

NOTES
       The order within a set is unimportant, thus, if

         (a b) (c d)

       is produced, then the following arrangement will never be encountered:

         (a b) (d c)

       On the other hand, the order of the sets is important, which means that
       the following arrangement will be encountered:

         (c d) (a b)

               for your set transformations.

BUGS
       Using a partition of length 0 is valid, although you get back an
       "undef", rather than an empty array. This could be construed as a bug.

       Please report all bugs at

       Make sure you include the output from the following two commands:

         perl -MSet::Partition -le 'print Set::Partition::VERSION'
         perl -V

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
       Ken Williams suggested the possibility to use a hash as a source for
       partitioning.
