NAME
       POE::Callback - object wrapper for callbacks with lexical closures

SYNOPSIS
               # TODO - Make this a complete working example.
               my $callback = POE::Callback->new(
                       name => "Pkg::sub",
                       code => \&coderef,
               );
               $callback->(@arguments);

DESCRIPTION
       POE::Callback wraps coderefs in magic that makes certain lexical
       variables persistent between calls.

       It's used internally by the classes that comprise POE::Stage.

   new CODEREF
       Creates a new callback from a raw CODEREF.  Returns the callback, which
       is just the CODEREF blessed into POE::Callback.
