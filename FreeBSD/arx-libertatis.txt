NAME
       arx-install-data - Install script for Arx Fatalis game data

SYNOPSIS
       arx-install-data [--cli|--gui] [sourcefile]

       arx-install-data --help

DESCRIPTION
       arx-install-data is a tool to extract and install Arx Fatalis data
       files from various sources, including GOG.com Setup files, Demo
       downloads, CDROMs and existing installs such as on Steam. This game
       data is required to run arx(6).

       By default it will provide an interactive interface (either command-
       line or graphical depending on the context) that will request all the
       required arguments and will automatically download patch files as
       needed. Alternatively, a source file or directory to install from can
       be provided as the first non-option argument.

       The script provides many more options such as a batch mode and fine
       control over the programs used to extract archives. See the --help
       output for all available options and required dependencies.
