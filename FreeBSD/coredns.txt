COREDNS
       coredns - pluggable DNS nameserver optimized for service discovery and
       flexibility.


SYNOPSIS
       coredns [-conf FILE] [-dns.port PORT} [OPTION]...


DESCRIPTION
       CoreDNS is a DNS server that chains plugins. Each plugin handles a DNS
       feature, like rewriting queries, kubernetes service discovery or just
       exporting metrics. There are many other plugins, each described on
       https://coredns.io/plugins ⟨https://coredns.io/plugins⟩ and their
       respective manual pages. Plugins not bundled by default in CoreDNS are
       listed on https://coredns.io/explugins ⟨https://coredns.io/explugins⟩.


       When started without options CoreDNS will look for a file named
       Corefile in the current directory, if found, it will parse its contents
       and start up accordingly. If no Corefile is found it will start with
       the whoami plugin (coredns-whoami(7)) and start listening on port 53
       (unless overridden with -dns.port).


       Available options:


       -conf FILE
              specify Corefile to load, if not given CoreDNS will look for a
              Corefile in the current directory.

       -dns.port PORT or -p PORT
              override default port (53) to listen on.

       -pidfile FILE
              write PID to FILE.

       -plugins
              list all plugins and quit.

       -quiet don't print any version and port information on startup.

       -version
              show version and quit.
