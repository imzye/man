ISCONTROL(8)            FreeBSD System Manager's Manual           ISCONTROL(8)

NAME
     iscontrol – login/negotiator/control for an iSCSI initiator session

SYNOPSIS
     iscontrol [-dv] [-c file [-n nickname]] [-p pidfile] [-t target]
               [variable=value]

DESCRIPTION
     This command, along with its kernel counterpart iscsi_initiator(4), is
     obsolete.  Users are advised to use iscsictl(8) instead.

     Internet SCSI (iSCSI) is a network protocol standard, that allows the use
     of the SCSI protocol over TCP/IP networks, the iscontrol program is the
     userland side of an iSCSI session, see iscsi_initiator(4).  It has 2
     modes of operation, if -d (discovery session) is specified, it will print
     out the target names returned by the target and exit.  In the second
     mode, it will, after a successful login/negotiation, run in daemon mode,
     monitoring the connection, and will try to reconnect in case of a
     network/target failure.  It will terminate/logout the session when a
     SIGHUP signal is received.  The flags are as follows:

     -c file         a file containing configuration key-options, see
                     iscsi.conf(5).

     -d              do a discovery session and exit.

     -n nickname     if -c file is specified, then search for the block named
                     nickname in that file, see iscsi.conf(5).

     -p pidfile      will write the process ID of the session to the specified
                     pidfile

     -t target       the target's IP address or name.

     -v              verbose mode.

     variable=value  see iscsi.conf(5) for the complete list of
                     variables/options and their possible values.

EXAMPLES
           iscontrol -dt myiscsitarget

     will start a discovery session with the target and print to stdout the
     list of available targetnames/targetadresses.  Note: this listing does
     not necessarily mean availability, since depending on the target
     configuration, a discovery session might not need login/access
     permission, but a full session certainly does.

           iscontrol -c /etc/iscsi.conf -n myiscsi

     will read options from /etc/iscsi.conf, use the targetaddress found in
     the block nicknamed myiscsi, login and negotiate whatever options are
     specified, and start an iscsi-session.

HISTORY
     The iscontrol utility appeared in FreeBSD 7.0.

BUGS
     iscontrol should probably load the iscsi_initiator module if needed.
     Not all functions/specifications have been implemented yet, noticeably
     missing are the Task Management Functions.  The error recovery, though
     not fully compliant does a brave effort to recover from network
     disconnects.
