GNORMALIZE(1)                                                    GNORMALIZE(1)



NAME
       gnormalize - audio file normalizer and converter

SYNOPSIS
       gnormalize [inputfile]


DESCRIPTION
        gnormalize is a GTK2 frontend to various commandline utilities that
       can be used for normalization and format conversion of audio files. It
       can furthermore be used to rip audio cds to any of the supported
       formats. Which formats are supported depends on the available audio
       encoders and decoders that are available on your system. With the
       necessary programs installed, gnormalize supports MP3, MP4 (M4A or
       AAC), MPC (MPP or MP+ - Musepack), OGG Vorbis, APE (Monkey's Audio),
       FLAC and WAV both as input and output formats. Additionally, the input
       can also come from an audio-cd. Meta-information like ID3 tags are
       preserved/converted during the file conversion.


       gnormalize is also capable of playing audio-cd and fetching meta
       information via CDDB if the CDDB_get perl module is installed.
