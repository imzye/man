NAME
     pkg_search – print information about a package

SYNOPSIS
     pkg_search [-h | -k | -r | -v] package

DESCRIPTION
     pkg_search querys the appropriate database file on FreeBSD and NetBSD for
     a given package name.  If pkg_search cannot find an INDEX file on FreeBSD
     or an INDEX file on NetBSD, it tries to fetch the file on FreeBSD or a
     pkg_summary(5) file on NetBSD.

     The options are as follows:

     -h             Print short usage information.

     -i             Print verbose information (Ports directory, URL,
                    dependencies)

     -k             Also query the Info and WWW field.

     -r             Print the directory within the Ports Collection where the
                    port lives.

     package        Required package package.
