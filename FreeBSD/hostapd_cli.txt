NAME
     hostapd_cli – text-based frontend program for interacting with hostapd(8)

SYNOPSIS
     hostapd_cli [commands]

DESCRIPTION
     The hostapd_cli utility is a text-based frontend program for interacting
     with hostapd(8).  It is used to query the current status.

     The hostapd_cli utility can show the current authentication status, dot11
     and dot1x MIBs, etc.

     The hostapd_cli utility supports two modes: interactive and command line.
     Both modes share the same command set.

     Interactive mode is started when hostapd_cli is executed without any
     parameters on the command line.  Commands are then entered from the
     controlling terminal in response to the hostapd_cli prompt.  In command
     line mode, the same commands are entered as command line arguments.

COMMANDS
     The following commands may be supplied on the command line or at a prompt
     when operating interactively.

     mib     Report MIB variables (dot1x, dot11) for the current interface.

     sta addr
             Report the MIB variables for the associated station with MAC
             address addr.

     all_sta
             Report the MIB variables for all associated stations.

     help    Show usage help.

     interface [ifname]
             Show available interfaces and/or set the current interface when
             multiple are available.

     level debug_level
             Change the debugging level in hostapd(8).  Larger numbers
             generate more messages.
