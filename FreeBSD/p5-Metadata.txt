NAME
       Metadata::Base - base class for metadata

SYNOPSIS
         package Metadata::FOO

         use vars(@ISA);
         ...
         @ISA=qw(Metadata::Base);
         ...

DESCRIPTION
       Metadata:Base class - the core functionality for handling metadata.

CONSTRUCTOR
       new [OPTIONS]
           Create a new Metadata object with an optional hash of options to
           describe the metadata characteristics.  Currently only the
           following can be set:

           DEBUG
               Set if debugging should be enabled from creation.  This can
               also be set and read by the debug method below.  If this is not
               defined, it is set to the current class debugging state which
               can be read from the class method debug described below.

           ORDERED
               Set if the metadata elements are ordered

COPY CONSTRUCTOR
       clone
           Create a new identical Metadata object from this one.

CLASS METHODS
       debug [VALUE]
           If VALUE is given, sets the debugging state of this class and
           returns the old state.  Otherwise returns the current debugging
           state.

       seconds_to_iso8601 SECONDS
           Convert the SECONDS value to (subset of) ISO-8601 format
           YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:SSZ representing the GMT/UTC value.

       iso8601_to_seconds VALUE
           Convert 6 ISO-8601 subset formats to a seconds value.  The 6
           formats are those proposed for the Dublin Core date use:

              YYYY
              YYYY-MM
              YYYY-MM-DD
              YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm
              YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZ
              YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.ssTZ

           where TZ can be 'Z', +hh:mm or -hh:mm

           NOTE: This method rounds towards the start of the period (it should
           really return two values for start and end).

METHODS
       debug [VALUE]
           If VALUE is given, sets the debugging state of this object and
           returns the old state.  Otherwise returns the current debugging
           state.  The default debugging state is determined by the class
           debug state.

       set ELEMENT, VALUE, [INDEX]
           Set element ELEMENT to VALUE.  If VALUE is an array reference, the
           existing array is used to as all the existing sub-values.
           Otherwise if INDEX is given, sets the particular sub-value of
           ELEMENT, otherwise appends to the end of the existing list of sub-
           values for ELEMENT.

       get ELEMENT, [INDEX]
           Return the contents of the given ELEMENT.  In an array context
           returns the sub-values as an array, in a scalar context they are
           all returned separated by spaces. If INDEX is given, returns the
           value of the given sub-value.

       delete ELEMENT, [INDEX}
           Delete the given ELEMENT.  If an INDEX is given, remove just that
           sub-value.

       exists ELEMENT, [INDEX]
           Returns a defined value if the given ELEMENT and/or sub-value INDEX
           exists.

       size [ELEMENT]
           Returns number of elements with no argument or the number of
           subvalues for the given ELEMENT or undef if ELEMENT does not exist.

       elements
           Return a list of the elements (in the correct order if there is
           one).

       order [ORDER]
           If ORDER is given, sets that as the order of the elements and
           returns the old order list.  Otherwise, returns the current order
           of the elements.  If the elements are not ordered, returns undef.

       validate ELEMENT, VALUE, [INDEX]
           This method is intended to be overriden by subclasses.  It is
           called when a element value is being set.  The method should return
           either a list of ELEMENT, VALUE and INDEX values to use or an
           undefined value in which case no element will be set.

       validate_elements ELEMENT, [INDEX]
           This method is intended to be overriden by subclasses.  It is
           called when a element and/or index is being read.  The method
           should return a list of ELEMENT and INDEX values to use.

       as_string =item format
           Returns a string representing the metadata, suitable for storing
           (in a text file).  This is different from the pack method because
           this value is meant to be the native encoding format of the
           metadata, usually human readable, wheras pack uses the minimum
           space.

       pack
           Return a packed string representing the metadata format.  This can
           be used with unpack to restore the values.

       unpack VALUE
           Initialise the metadata from the packed VALUE which must be the
           value made by the pack method.

       read HANDLE
           Reads from the given file handle and initialises the metadata
           elements.  Returns undef if end of file is seen.

       write HANDLE
           Write to the given file handle a formatted version of this metadata
           format.  Likely to use format in most implementations.

       reset
           Reset the metadata object to the default ones (including any passed
           with the constructor) and then do a clear.

       clear
           Remove any stored elements in this metadata object.  This can be
           used in conjuction with read to prevent the overhead of many new
           operations when reading metadata objects from files.

       get_date_as_seconds ELEMENT
           Assuming ELEMENT is stored in a date format, returns the number of
           seconds since 1st January 1970.

       set_date_as_seconds ELEMENT, VALUE
           Set ELEMENT encoded as a date corresponding to VALUE which is the
           number of seconds since 1st January 1970.
