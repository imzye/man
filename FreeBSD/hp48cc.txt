NAME
     hp48cc – C to HP48 RPN compiler

SYNOPSIS
     hp48cc [-V] [-o file] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     Hp48cc is a C-like compiler that translates input code into the HP48 RPN
     language.  The language recognized by the compiler is only a small subset
     of the C language with some non-standard extensions.  However, the
     language is powerful enough to write complex programs simply.

     The options are as follows:

     -o      Set the output destination to file.

     -V      Print version information on standard output then exit.
