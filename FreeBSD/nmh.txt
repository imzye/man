ALI(1)                  FreeBSD General Commands Manual                 ALI(1)

NAME
       ali - list nmh mail aliases

SYNOPSIS
       ali [-help] [-version] [-alias aliasfile] [-list | -nolist] [-user |
            -nouser] [aliases ...]

DESCRIPTION
       ali searches the named mail alias files for each of the given aliases.
       It creates a list of addresses for those aliases, and writes that list
       on standard output.  If no arguments are given, ali outputs all alias
       entries.

       By default, when an alias expands to multiple addresses, the addresses
       are separated by commas and printed on as few lines as possible.  If
       the -list switch is specified, and an address expands to multiple
       addresses, each address will appear on a separate line.

       The -user switch directs ali to perform its processing in an inverted
       fashion: instead of listing the addresses that each given alias expands
       to, ali will list the aliases that expand to each given address.

       The files specified by the profile entry “Aliasfile” and any additional
       alias files given by the -alias aliasfile switch will be read.  Each
       alias is processed as described in mh-alias(5).

FILES
       Alias files are looked up in multiple locations: if the pathname is
       absolute or starts with “.” or “..” it is accessed directly; otherwise
       tilde expansion is done on usernames, then files are searched for in
       the user's Mail directory as specified in their profile.  If not found
       there, the directory “/usr/local/etc/nmh” is checked.

       $HOME/.mh_profile   The user's profile.

PROFILE COMPONENTS
