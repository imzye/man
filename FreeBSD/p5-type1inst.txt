NAME
       type1inst - Type 1 PostScript font installation utility for the X
       Window System and Ghostscript

VERSION
       0.6.1 (February 11 1998)

SYNOPSIS
       type1inst [-nox] [-nogs] [-samples] [-nolog] [-q] [-quiet] [-silent]
       [-version] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       type1inst is a utility which scans Type 1 PostScript font files and
       generates automatically the fonts.scale file which the X Window System
       uses to pick up fonts in the current directory and/or the Fontmap file
       which Ghostscript uses to map file names to font names.  It can also
       generate simple font sample sheets which show what your fonts look
       like.

       type1inst is a Perl script so you will need to have that installed on
       your system.  The pfbtops utility (which comes as part of GNU groff) is
       also required.

ADOBE DPS USERS NOTE
       If you are using a commercial Unix system which has a Display
       PostScript-capable X server (for example Sun Solaris 2.3 or later) then
       you should not use type1inst for generating a fonts.scale file (indeed,
       such systems do not even use fonts.scale).  The makepsres utility which
       came with your system does what you want.  You can, however, still use
       this program with Ghostscript if you wish.

USAGE
       Change directory to the directory where the fonts you wish to have
       processed are located.  Invoking type1inst will then generate a
       fonts.scale and a Fontmap.  The program also has a number of options as
       detailed below.

OPTIONS
       -nox    Supresses generation/update of the file fonts.scale which lists
               the fonts in the current directory for the benefit of the X
               Window System.  This file is generated or updated by default.

       -nogs   Supresses generation/update of the file Fontmap which lists the
               fonts in the current directory for the benefit of Ghostscript.
               This file is generated or updated by default.

       -samples
               Creates PostScript files showing the fonts in the current
               directory.  One file is created for each font in the
               subdirectory samples as well as one or more files showing the
               fonts together.

       -nolog  Supresses the generation of a log file detailing what happened
               during the last run of type1inst.  This file is generated by
               default.

       -quiet  Stops type1inst from printing messages on stdout.  Messages
               will be written to the log file, unless -nolog is also
               specified, in which case the program does its work but does not
               record anywhere what happened.

       -q      Same as -quiet.

       -silent This has the same effect as -quiet.

       -version
               Print version information and exit.

       -v      Same as -version.

       of the type1inst distribution.
