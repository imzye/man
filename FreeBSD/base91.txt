NAME
       base91, b91enc, b91dec - basE91 encode/decode data

SYNOPSIS
       base91 [OPTION]... [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       Convert binary data in FILE to plain ASCII text (or vice versa),
       writing to standard output. With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read
       standard input.

       -d, --decode
              decode data (default for b91dec); all non-alphabet characters
              (such as newlines) are ignored

       -m SIZE
              use maximum SIZE bytes of main memory for buffers (default 64K);
              SIZE may be followed by a multiplicative suffix: K 1024, M
              1024*1024

       -o, --output=FILE
              write result to FILE instead of standard output

       -v, --verbose
              run in verbose mode and write some statistics to standard error;
              use it twice to increase verbosity

       -w, --wrap=COLS
              wrap encoded lines after COLS characters (default 76); use 0 to
              disable line wrapping (default for b91enc)

       --help prints out the available program options

       --version
              output version information and exit

       basE91 is an advanced method for encoding binary data as ASCII
       characters. It is similar to UUencode or base64, but is more efficient.
       The overhead produced by basE91 depends on the input data. It amounts
       at most to 23% (versus 33% for base64) and can range down to 14%, which
       typically occurs on 0-byte blocks.  This makes basE91 very useful for
       transferring larger files over binary insecure connections like e-mail
       or terminal lines.
