Number::RecordLocator(3)                   User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Number::RecordLocator - Encodes integers into a short and easy to read
       and pronounce "locator string"

SYNOPSIS
           use Number::RecordLocator;

           my $generator = Number::RecordLocator->new();
           my $string = $generator->encode("123456");

           # $string = "5RL2";

           my $number = $generator->decode($string);

           # $number = "123456";

DESCRIPTION
       "Number::RecordLocator" encodes integers into a 32 character "alphabet"
       designed to be short and easy to read and pronounce.  The encoding
       maps:

           0 to O
           1 to I
           S to F
           B to P

       With a 32 bit encoding, you can map 33.5 million unique ids into a 5
       character code.

       This certainly isn't an exact science and I'm not yet 100% sure of the
       encoding.  Feedback is much appreciated.

   new
       Instantiate a new "Number::RecordLocator" object. Right now, we don't
       actually store any object-specific data, but in the future, we might.

   init
       Initializes our integer to character and character to integer mapping
       tables.

   encode INTEGER
       Takes an integer. Returns a Record Locator string.

   decode STRING
       Takes a record locator string and returns an integer. If you pass in a
       string containing an invalid character, it returns undef.

   canonicalize STRING
       To compare a Record Locator string with another you can do:

         print "ALWAYS TRUE\n" if $generator->decode("B0") == $generator->decode("PO");

       However, this method provides an alternative:

         my $rl_string = $generator->encode(725);
         print "ALWAYS TRUE\n" if $generator->canonicalize("b0") eq $rl_string;
         print "ALWAYS TRUE\n" if $generator->canonicalize("BO") eq $rl_string;
         print "ALWAYS TRUE\n" if $generator->canonicalize("P0") eq $rl_string;
         print "ALWAYS TRUE\n" if $generator->canonicalize("po") eq $rl_string;

       This is primarily useful if you store the record locator rather than
       just the original integer and don't want to have to decode your strings
       to do comparisons.

       Takes a general Record Locator string and returns one with character
       mappings listed in "DESCRIPTION" applied to it. This allows string
       comparisons to work.  This returns "undef" if a non-alphanumeric
       character is found in the string.
