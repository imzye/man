NAME
       tlsdate-helper - secure parasitic rdate replacement

SYNOPSIS
       tlsdate-helper host port protocol ca_racket verbose certdir setclock
       showtime timewarp leapaway proxy-type://proxyhost:proxyport httpmode

DESCRIPTION
       tlsdate-helper is a tool for setting the system clock by hand or by
       communication with the network. It does not set the Real Time Clock. It
       is designed to be as secure as TLS (RFC 2246) but of course the
       security of TLS is often reduced to whichever CA racket you believe is
       trustworthy. By default, tlsdate-helper trusts your local CA root store
       - so any of these companies could assist in a MITM attack against you
       and you'd be screwed.

       The proxy argument expects HTTP, SOCKS4A or SOCKS5 formatted as
       followed:

        http://127.0.0.1:8118
        socks4a://127.0.0.1:9050
        socks5://127.0.0.1:9050

       This tool is designed to be run by hand or as a system daemon. It must
       be run as root or otherwise have the proper caps; it will not be able
       to set the system time without running as root or another privileged
       user.

BUGS
       It's likely! Let us know by contacting jacob@appelbaum.net

       Note that tlsdate(1) is in Beta, and may not work as expected.
