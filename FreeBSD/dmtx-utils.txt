NAME
       dmtxread - scan Data Matrix barcodes

SYNOPSIS
       dmtxread [options] [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       dmtxread searches the named input FILEs (or standard input if no files
       are named or the filename "-" is given) for ECC200 Data Matrix
       barcodes, reads their contents, and writes the decoded messages to
       standard output.

OPTIONS
       -c, --codewords
              Only print the codewords extracted from a Data Matrix, and not
              the actual decoded message.

       -e, --minimum-edge=N
              Pixel length of smallest expected edge in image.

       -E, --maximum-edge=N
              Pixel length of largest expected edge in image.

       -g, --gap=N
              Use scan grid with gap of N pixels (or less) between lines.

       -l, --list-formats
              List the supported input image formats.

       -m, --milliseconds=N
              Stop scan after N milliseconds (per image).

       -n, --newline
              Print a newline character at the end of decoded data.

       -p, --page=N
              Only scan Nth page of images.

       -q, --square-deviation=N
              Maximum deviation (degrees) from squareness between adjacent
              barcode sides. Default value is N=40, but N=10 is recommended
              for flat applications like faxes and other scanned documents.
              Barcode regions found with corners <(90-N) or >(90+N) will be
              ignored by the decoder.

       -r, --resolution=N
              Decoding resolution in dots per inch (DPI). Only used for
              vectorial input images such as SVG, PDF, etc... This option
              accepts a single argument (eg: 300) as well as horizontal and
              vertical resolutions (eg: 300x150). The default resolution is
              72dpi.

       -s, --symbol-size=[asr|RxC]
              Only consider barcodes of specific size or shape.
                 a = All sizes     [default]
                 s = Only squares
                 r = Only rectangles
               RxC = Exactly this many rows and columns (10x10, 8x18, etc...)

       -t, --threshold=N
              Set the minimum edge threshold as a percentage of maximum. For
              example, an edge between a pure white and pure black pixel would
              have an intensity of 100. Edges with intensities below the
              indicated threshold will be ignored by the decoding process.
              Lowering the threshold will increase the amount of work to be
              done, but may be necessary for low contrast or blurry images.

       -x, --x-range-min=N[%]
              Do not scan pixels to the left of pixel column N (or N%).

       -X, --x-range-max=N[%]
              Do not scan pixels to the right of pixel column N (or N%).

       -y, --y-range-min=N[%]
              Do not scan pixels below pixel row N (or N%).

       -Y, --y-range-max=N[%]
              Do not scan pixels above pixel row N (or N%).

       -C, --corrections-max=N
              Correct at most N errors per image (0 = correction disabled).

       -D, --diagnose
              Make copy of image with additional diagnostic data.

       -M, --mosaic (experimental)
              Interpret detected regions as Data Mosaic barcodes.

       -N, --stop-after=N
              Stop scanning after Nth barcode is returned.

       -P, --page-numbers
              Print each decoded message with its fax/tiff page number.

       -R, --corners
              Prefix the decoded message with the barcode's corner locations.

       -S, --shrink=N
              Internally shrink image by factor of N. Shrinking is
              accomplished by skipping N-1 pixels at a time, often producing
              significantly faster scan times. It also improves scan success
              rate for images taken with poor camera focus provided the image
              is sufficiently large.

       -U, --unicode
              Print Extended ASCII characters in UTF-8 Unicode.

       -v, --verbose
              Use verbose messages.

       -V, --version
              Print program version information.

       --help Display this help message and quit.

       Exit status has following possible meanings:
          0  At least one barcode was found and decoded
          1  No barcodes were found
         >1  Error occurred that prevented command from executing normally
