NAME
       Chemistry::Reaction - Explicit chemical reactions

SYNOPSIS
           use Chemistry::Reaction;
           use Chemistry::File::SMILES;

           my $s = Chemistry::Pattern->parse('C=CC=C.C=C', format=>'smiles');
           my $p = Chemistry::Pattern->parse('C1=CCCCC1', format=>'smiles');
           my %m;
           for (my $i = 1; $i <= $s->atoms; $i++) {
             $m{$s->atoms($i)} = $p->atoms($i);
           }
           my $r = Chemistry::Reaction->new($s, $p, \%m);

DESCRIPTION
       This package, along with Chemistry::Pattern, provides an implementation
       of explicit chemical reactions.

       An explicit chemical reaction is a representation of the transformation
       that takes place in a given chemical reaction. In an explicit chemical
       reaction, a substrate molecule is transformed into a product molecule
       by breaking existing bonds and creating new bonds between atoms.

       The representation of an explicit chemical reaction is a molecule in
       which the order of a bond before the chemical reaction is distinguished
       from the order of the bond after the chemical reaction. Thus, the
       breaking of an existing bond is represented by one of the following
       before/after pairs:

         3/2, 2/1, 1/0 (breaking of a single bond or reduce order by one)
              3/1, 2/0 (breaking of a double bond or reduce order by two)
                   3/0 (breaking of a triple bond)

       The creation of a new bond is represented by one of the following
       before/after pairs:

         0/1, 1/2, 2/3 (creation of a single bond or increase order by one)
              0/2, 1/3 (creation of a double bond or increase order by two)
                   0/3 (creation of a triple bond)

       An explicit chemical reaction $react can be forward or reverse applied
       once to a molecule $mol at the first subgraph of $mol found which is
       isomorphic to the substrate or product of $react:

           my $subst = $react->substrate;
           if ($subst->match($mol)) {
             $react->forward($mol, $subst->atom_map);
           }

       Also, an explicit chemical reaction $react can be forward or reverse
       applied once to a molecule $mol at each subgraph of $mol which is
       isomorphic to the substrate or product of $react:

           my $subst = $react->substrate;
           my @products;
           while ($subst->match($mol)) {
             my $new_mol = $mol->clone; # start from a fresh molecule
             my @map = $subst->atom_map;
             # translate atom map to the clone
             my @m = map { $new_mol->by_id($_->id) } @map;
             $react->forward($new_mol, @m);
             push @products, $new_mol;
           }

       Furthermore, an explicit chemical reaction $react can be forward or
       reverse applied as long as possible to a molecule $mol at the first
       subgraph of $mol found which is isomorphic to the substrate or product
       of $react:

           my $subst = $react->substrate;
           while ($subst->match($mol)) {
             $react->forward($mol, $subst->atom_map);
           }

METHODS
       Chemistry::Reaction->new($subst, $prod, \%map)
           Create a new Reaction object that describes the transformation of
           the $subst substrate into the $prod product, according to the %map
           mapping of substrate atoms to product atoms.

       $react->substrate
           Return a Chemistry::Pattern object that represents the substrate
           molecules of the explicit chemical reaction $react.

       $react->product
           Return a Chemistry::Pattern object that represents the product
           molecules of the explicit chemical reaction $react.

       $react->forward($mol, @map)
           Forward application of the explicit chemical reaction $react to the
           molecule $mol, according to the mapping @map of substrate atoms to
           $mol atoms. The substrate of the explicit chemical reaction $react
           must be a subgraph of the molecule $mol. Return the modified
           molecule $mol.

       $react->reverse($mol, @map)
           Reverse application of the explicit chemical reaction $react to the
           molecule $mol, according to the mapping @map of product atoms to
           $mol atoms. The product of the explicit chemical reaction $react
           must be a subgraph of the molecule $mol. Return the modified
           molecule $mol.
