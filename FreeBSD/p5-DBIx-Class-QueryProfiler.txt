DBIx::Class::QueryProfiler(3)              User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       DBIx::Class::QueryProfiler - DBIx::Class profiler

DESCRIPTION
       Profiler for DBIx::Class. Also it provides more usable output or
       queries.

SYNOPSYS
       In order to start using just declare in your schema the code

           use DBIx::Class::QueryProfiler;

           sub connection {
               my $self = shift;
               my $response = $self->next::method(@_);
               $response->storage->auto_savepoint(1);
               $response->storage->debug(1);
               $response->storage->debugobj(DBIx::Class::QueryProfiler->new);
               return $response;
           }

       Possible to use debugfh () to select right output debuging filehandle

           $response->storage->debugfh(IO::File->new('/tmp/trace.out', 'w'));

       or it can be set through an environment variable DBIC_TRACE

           export DBIC_TRACE="1=/tmp/trace.out"

METHODS
   query_start
       Called before a query is executed. The first argument is the SQL string
       being executed and subsequent arguments are the parameters used for the
       query.

   query_end
       Called when a query finishes executing. Has the same arguments as
       query_start.

   print
       Prints the specified string to our debugging filehandle, which we will
       attempt to open if we haven't yet.

BUGS
       No bugs. Found? Report please :-)
