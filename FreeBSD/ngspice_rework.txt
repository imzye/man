NGSPICE(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             NGSPICE(1)

NAME
       ngspice - circuit simulator derived from SPICE3f5

SYNOPSIS
       ngspice [options] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This man page is just a small overview.  The primary documentation of
       ngspice is in the ngspice User's Manual, which is available as a pdf
       file.

OPTIONS
       -n  or  --no-spiceinit
              Don't try to source the file ".spiceinit" upon startup. Normally
              ngspice tries to find the file in the current directory, and if
              it is not found then in the user's home directory.

       -q  or  --completion
              Enable command completion. (defect)

       -t term  or  --term=term
              The program is being run on a terminal with mfb name term.

       -b  or  --batch
              Run in batch mode.  ngspice will read the standard input or the
              specified input file and do the simulation.  Note that if the
              standard input is not a terminal, ngspice will default to batch
              mode, unless the -i flag is given.

       -s  or  --server
              Run in server mode.  This is like batch mode, except that a
              temporary rawfile is used and then written to the standard
              output, preceded by a line with a single "@", after the
              simulation is done.  This mode is used by the ngspice daemon.

       -i  or  --interactive
              Run in interactive mode.  This is useful if the standard input
              is not a terminal but interactive mode is desired.  Command
              completion is not available unless the standard input is a
              terminal, however.

       -r rawfile  or  --rawfile=file
              Use rawfile as the default file into which the results of the
              simulation are saved.

       -c circuitfile  or  --circuitfile=circuitfile
              Use circuitfile as the default input deck.

       -h  or  --help
              Display a verbose help on the arguments available to the
              program.

       -v  or  --version
              Display a version number and copyright information of the
              program.

       -a  or  --autorun
              FIXME

       -o outfile  or  --output=outfile
              All logs generated during a batch run (-b) will be saved in
              outfile.

       -p  or  --pipe
              Allow a program (e.g., xcircuit) to act as a GUI frontend for
              ngspice through a pipe.  Thus ngspice will assume that the pipe
              is a tty and allows one to run in interactive mode.

       Further arguments are taken to be SPICE input decks, which are read and
       saved.  (If batch mode is requested then they are run immediately.)

ENVIRONMENT
       SPICE_LIB_DIR

       SPICE_EXEC_DIR

       SPICE_HOST

       SPICE_BUGADDR

       SPICE_EDITOR

       SPICE_ASCIIRAWFILE  default  0
              Format of the rawfile.  0 for binary, and 1 for ascii.

       SPICE_NEWS  default  $SPICE_LIB_DIR/news
              A file which is copied verbatim to stdout when ngspice starts in

       SPICE_HELP_DIR  default  $SPICE_LIB_DIR/helpdir

       SPICE_SCRIPTS  default  $SPICE_LIB_DIR/scripts
              In this directory the spinit file will be searched.
