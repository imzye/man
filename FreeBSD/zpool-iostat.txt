ZPOOL-IOSTAT(8)         FreeBSD System Manager's Manual        ZPOOL-IOSTAT(8)

NAME
     zpool-iostat – display logical I/O statistics for ZFS storage pools

SYNOPSIS
     zpool iostat [[[-c SCRIPT] [-lq]]|-rw] [-T u|d] [-ghHLnpPvy]
           [pool…|[pool vdev…]|vdev…] [interval [count]]

DESCRIPTION
     Displays logical I/O statistics for the given pools/vdevs.  Physical I/O
     statistics may be observed via iostat(1).  If writes are located nearby,
     they may be merged into a single larger operation.  Additional I/O may be
     generated depending on the level of vdev redundancy.  To filter output,
     you may pass in a list of pools, a pool and list of vdevs in that pool,
     or a list of any vdevs from any pool.  If no items are specified,
     statistics for every pool in the system are shown.  When given an
     interval, the statistics are printed every interval seconds until killed.
     If -n flag is specified the headers are displayed only once, otherwise
     they are displayed periodically.  If count is specified, the command
     exits after count reports are printed.  The first report printed is
     always the statistics since boot regardless of whether interval and count
     are passed.  However, this behavior can be suppressed with the -y flag.
     Also note that the units of K, M, G… that are printed in the report are
     in base 1024.  To get the raw values, use the -p flag.

     -c [SCRIPT1[,SCRIPT2]…]
             Run a script (or scripts) on each vdev and include the output as
             a new column in the zpool iostat output.  Users can run any
             script found in their ~/.zpool.d directory or from the system
             /etc/zfs/zpool.d directory.  Script names containing the slash
             (/) character are not allowed.  The default search path can be
             overridden by setting the ZPOOL_SCRIPTS_PATH environment
             variable.  A privileged user can only run -c if they have the
             ZPOOL_SCRIPTS_AS_ROOT environment variable set.  If a script
             requires the use of a privileged command, like smartctl(8), then
             it's recommended you allow the user access to it in /etc/sudoers
             or add the user to the /etc/sudoers.d/zfs file.

             If -c is passed without a script name, it prints a list of all
             scripts.  -c also sets verbose mode (-v).

             Script output should be in the form of "name=value".  The column
             name is set to "name" and the value is set to "value".  Multiple
             lines can be used to output multiple columns.  The first line of
             output not in the "name=value" format is displayed without a
             column title, and no more output after that is displayed.  This
             can be useful for printing error messages.  Blank or NULL values
             are printed as a '-' to make output AWKable.

             The following environment variables are set before running each
             script:
             VDEV_PATH            Full path to the vdev
             VDEV_UPATH           Underlying path to the vdev (/dev/sd*).  For
                                  use with device mapper, multipath, or
                                  partitioned vdevs.
             VDEV_ENC_SYSFS_PATH  The sysfs path to the enclosure for the vdev
                                  (if any).

     -T u|d  Display a time stamp.  Specify u for a printed representation of
             the internal representation of time.  See time(2).  Specify d for
             standard date format.  See date(1).

     -g      Display vdev GUIDs instead of the normal device names.  These
             GUIDs can be used in place of device names for the zpool
             detach/offline/remove/replace commands.

     -H      Scripted mode.  Do not display headers, and separate fields by a
             single tab instead of arbitrary space.

     -L      Display real paths for vdevs resolving all symbolic links.  This
             can be used to look up the current block device name regardless
             of the /dev/disk/ path used to open it.

     -n      Print headers only once when passed

     -p      Display numbers in parsable (exact) values.  Time values are in
             nanoseconds.

     -P      Display full paths for vdevs instead of only the last component
             of the path.  This can be used in conjunction with the -L flag.

     -r      Print request size histograms for the leaf vdev's I/O.  This
             includes histograms of individual I/O (ind) and aggregate I/O
             (agg).  These stats can be useful for observing how well I/O
             aggregation is working.  Note that TRIM I/O may exceed 16M, but
             will be counted as 16M.

     -v      Verbose statistics Reports usage statistics for individual vdevs
             within the pool, in addition to the pool-wide statistics.

     -y      Normally the first line of output reports the statistics since
             boot: suppress it.

     -w      Display latency histograms:
             total_wait         Total I/O time (queuing + disk I/O time).
             disk_wait          Disk I/O time (time reading/writing the disk).
             syncq_wait         Amount of time I/O spent in synchronous
                                priority queues.  Does not include disk time.
             asyncq_wait        Amount of time I/O spent in asynchronous
                                priority queues.  Does not include disk time.
             scrub              Amount of time I/O spent in scrub queue.  Does
                                not include disk time.

     -l      Include average latency statistics:
             total_wait         Average total I/O time (queuing + disk I/O
                                time).
             disk_wait          Average disk I/O time (time reading/writing
                                the disk).
             syncq_wait         Average amount of time I/O spent in
                                synchronous priority queues.  Does not include
                                disk time.
             asyncq_wait        Average amount of time I/O spent in
                                asynchronous priority queues.  Does not
                                include disk time.
             scrub              Average queuing time in scrub queue.  Does not
                                include disk time.
             trim               Average queuing time in trim queue.  Does not
                                include disk time.

     -q      Include active queue statistics.  Each priority queue has both
             pending (pend) and active (activ) I/O requests.  Pending requests
             are waiting to be issued to the disk, and active requests have
             been issued to disk and are waiting for completion.  These stats
             are broken out by priority queue:
             syncq_read/write   Current number of entries in synchronous
                                priority queues.
             asyncq_read/write  Current number of entries in asynchronous
                                priority queues.
             scrubq_read        Current number of entries in scrub queue.
             trimq_write        Current number of entries in trim queue.

             All queue statistics are instantaneous measurements of the number
             of entries in the queues.  If you specify an interval, the
             measurements will be sampled from the end of the interval.
