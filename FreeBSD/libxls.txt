NAME
       xls2csv - convert binary Excel (.xls) files to CSV

SYNOPSIS
       xls2csv input-file [-l] [-v] [-e encoding] [-t sheet] [-q quote char]
       [-f field separator]

DESCRIPTION
       xls2csv converts binary Excel files (.xls) to comma-separated values
       (CSV), sending the plain-text output to standard out.

       Unless otherwise specified, all sheets in the workbook are processed,
       and the output values are double-quoted, separated by semicolons, and
       encoded as UTF-8. This behavior may be customized with the options
       below.

OPTIONS
       -l     List sheets contained in the file but do not output their
              contents.

       -t sheet
              Only process the named sheet.

       -e encoding
              The iconv output encoding (default "UTF-8")

       -q quote char
              The character used to quote strings (default '"')

       -f field separator
              The character used to separate strings (default ';')

       -v     Verbose mode

BUGS
       The conversion tool has not been tested on big-endian machines.
