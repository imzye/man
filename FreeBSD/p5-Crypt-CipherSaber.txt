Crypt::CipherSaber(3)                      User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Crypt::CipherSaber - Perl module implementing CipherSaber encryption.

SYNOPSIS
         use Crypt::CipherSaber;
         my $cs = Crypt::CipherSaber->new('my sad secret key');

         my $coded   = $cs->encrypt('Here is a secret message for you');
         my $decoded = $cs->decrypt($coded);

         # encrypt from and to a file
         open my $in,       'secretletter.txt' or die "Can't open infile: $!";
         open my $out, '>', 'secretletter.cs1' or die "Can't open outfile: $!";
         binmode $in;
         binmode $out;

         $cs->fh_crypt($in, $out, 1);

         # decrypt from and to a file
         open my $in,       'secretletter.txt' or die "Can't open infile: $!";
         open my $out, '>', 'secretletter.cs1' or die "Can't open outfile: $!";

         binmode $in;
         binmode $out;
         $cs->fh_crypt($in, $out);

DESCRIPTION
       The Crypt::CipherSaber module implements CipherSaber encryption,
       described at <http://ciphersaber.gurus.com/>.  It is simple, fairly
       speedy, and relatively secure algorithm based on RC4. Relatively, given
       RC4.

       Encryption and decryption are done based on a secret key, which must be
       shared with all intended recipients of a message.

METHODS
       new($key, $N)
           Initialize a new Crypt::CipherSaber object.  $key is a required
           parameter: the key used to encrypt or to decrypt messages.  $N is
           optional.  If provided and greater than one, it causes the object
           to use CipherSaber-2 encryption (slightly slower but more secure).
           If not specified, or equal to 1, the module defaults to
           CipherSaber-1 encryption.  $N must be a positive integer greater
           than one.

       encrypt($message)
           Encrypt a message.  This uses the key stored in the current
           Crypt::CipherSaber object.  It generates a 10-byte random IV
           (Initialization Vector) automatically, as defined in the RC4
           specification.  This returns a string containing the encrypted
           message.

           Note that the encrypted message may contain unprintable characters,
           as it uses the extended ASCII character set (valid numbers 0
           through 255).

       decrypt($message)
           Decrypt a message.  For the curious, the first ten bytes of an
           encrypted message are the IV, so this must strip it off first.
           This returns a string containing the decrypted message.

           The decrypted message may also contain unprintable characters, as
           the CipherSaber encryption scheme handles binary filesIf this is
           important to you, be sure to treat the results correctly.

       crypt($iv, $message)
           If you wish to generate the IV with a more cryptographically secure
           random string (at least compared to Perl's builtin rand()
           operator), you may do so separately, passing it to this method
           directly.  The IV must be a ten-byte string consisting of
           characters from the extended ASCII set.

           This is generally only useful for encryption, although you may
           extract the first ten characters of an encrypted message and pass
           them in yourself.  You might as well call decrypt(), though.  The
           more random the IV, the stronger the encryption tends to be.  On
           some operating systems, you can read from /dev/random.  Other
           approaches are the Math::TrulyRandom module, or compressing a file,
           removing the headers, and compressing it again.

       fh_crypt( $in_fh, $out_fh, ($iv))
           For the sake of efficiency, Crypt::CipherSaber can operate on
           filehandles.  It's not super brilliant, but it's relatively fast
           and sane.  If your platform needs to use binmode(), this is your
           responsibility.  It is also your responsibility to close the files.

           You may also pass in an optional third parameter, an IV.  There are
           three possibilities here.  If you pass no IV, fh_crypt() will pull
           the first ten bytes from the input filehandle and use that as an
           IV.  This corresponds to decryption.  If you pass in an IV of your
           own, it will use that when encrypting the file.  If you pass in the
           value 1, it will generate a new, random IV for you.  This
           corresponds to an encryption.
