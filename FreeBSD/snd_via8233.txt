SND_VIA8233(4)         FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual         SND_VIA8233(4)

NAME
     snd_via8233 – VIA Technologies VT8233 bridge device driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device sound
           device snd_via8233

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           snd_via8233_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The snd_via8233 bridge driver allows the generic audio driver, sound(4),
     to attach to the VIA VT8233 audio devices.  These audio chipsets are
     integrated in the southbridge on many VIA based motherboards.

   Runtime Configuration
     The following sysctl(8) variables are available in addition to those
     available to all sound(4) devices:

           dev.pcm.%d.polling      Experimental polling mode, where the driver
                                   operates by querying the device state on
                                   each tick using callout(9).  Polling is
                                   disabled by default.  Do not enable it
                                   unless you are facing weird interrupt
                                   problems or if the device cannot generate
                                   interrupts at all.

HARDWARE
     The snd_via8233 driver supports the following audio chipsets:

     •   VIA VT8233
     •   VIA VT8233A
     •   VIA VT8233C
     •   VIA VT8235
     •   VIA VT8237
     •   VIA VT8251

HISTORY
     The snd_via8233 device driver first appeared in FreeBSD 4.7.

BUGS
     The snd_via8233 driver does not support S/PDIF.  There is partial support
     in the code, so implementing it should be fairly easy if the right
     hardware is available.
