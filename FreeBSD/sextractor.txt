DESCRIPTION
       SExtractor is a program that builds a catalogue of objects from an
       astronomical image. Although it is particularly oriented towards
       reduction of large scale galaxy-survey data, it performs rather well on
       moderately crowded star fields.
       See http://terapix.iap.fr/soft/sextractor for more details.
