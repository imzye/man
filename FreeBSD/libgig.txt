NAME
       akaidump - Dump an AKAI media (i.e. CDROM) as disk image file to your
       HD.

SYNOPSIS
       akaiextract SOURCE DESTFILE

DESCRIPTION
       Reads an AKAI media (i.e. from a CDROM drive, ZIP drive or directly
       from an AKAI hard disk drive) and writes it as AKAI disk image file to
       your hard disc drive for more convenient and faster further usage.

OPTIONS
        SOURCE
              On Windows: drive letter of the source disk drive to read from.
              On POSIX systems (i.e. Linux, Mac): path to the input source,
              which may either be an AKAI disk image file already being
              available on your HD, or a disk drive path (i.e. '/dev/cdrom').
              On Mac: You can omit this argument on Mac, which will cause it
              to access the CDROM drive automatically ('/dev/rdisk1s0').

        DESTFILE
              Target filename to write the AKAI disk image to.

Author
       This program and its library are based on Sébastien Métrot's libakai.
       This is a fork of libakai and its tools which is now also providing
       support for LINUX and other POSIX compliant operating system, and it
       does not have a dependency to libngl as the original libakai had. Linux
