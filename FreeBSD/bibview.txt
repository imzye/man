NAME
       bibview - an X based graphical user interface for manipulating BibTeX
       databases

SYNOPSIS
       bibview  [standard options] [-file <bib file>] [-rcfile <conf file>]
       [-bibdir <directory>]

DESCRIPTION
       Bibview facilitates the manipulation of BibTeX databases (in the
       following called BiB). It supports the user in making new entries,
       searching for entries and moving entries from one BiB to another.  It
       is possible to work with more than one BiB simultaneously.  New types
       can be defined and new fields can be added to existing types in a
       configuration file.
       There are six types of windows in bibview:
       The main window contains menus for customizing bibview and for working
       with BiBs on the file level.
       The bibliography window (one for every open BiB) contains commands for
       manipulating the BiB.
       The list window (at most one for every open BiB) shows a list of
       entries. It displays the fields author, title, year, category and type.
       The fields that are displayed and the layout of the fields can be
       changed in the configuration file.  The entries of the list window can
       be sorted by all field by default.  The fields by which a list can be
       sorted can be set in the configuration file.
       The card window (at most one for every entry) helps editing an entry.
       It contains boxes for each field of the entry (according to the type).
       The fields can be edited by putting the mouse cursor into the card
       window. The field with the input focus has no border. The input focus
       can be changed using the <tab> key (move to next field), the <esc> key
       (move to preceding field) or by clicking the right mouse button in the
       new input field. You can change this behaviour in the resource file or
       in the file .bibviewrc. In this case input will go to the field in
       which the mouse is placed.
       The annote field of an entry can be edited in a separate window after
       clicking 'annote' in the card window.  The required fields are marked
       by bold lines.  A card window is displayed after clicking an entry in
       the list menu (left mouse button), selecting a type in the `New` menu
       of a bibliography window or duplicating an entry with the `Duplicate'
       menu of the card window.
       The macro window (at most one for every open BiB) helps editing the
       STRING and PREAMBLE parts of a BiB.
       The error window (at most one for every BiB) is displayed if a BiB
       cannot be opened because of syntax errors. The line with the error is
       marked. The file can be edited and opened again.


Main Window
       The main window is displayed at the start of bibview.  It offers the
       following menus.
       File:  Load and save BiBs. For choosing a name a file select box is
       displayed. The file select box initially shows the content of the
       current working directory or of the default directory defined in the
       configuration file. A file is chosen by clicking a filename and the OK
       button of the box or by entering a filename.

              New     Create a new BiB.

              Open    Read an existing BiB.

              Close   Close an open BiB.

              Save    Save an open BiB.

              Save as Save an open BiB and select a new name for it.

              Quit    Quit a bibview session.

       Services:

              Consistency Check
                      Entries that don't contain all required fields for that
                      type are shown in the list window. If an entry contains
                      a crossreference, it is regarded as complete. (The
                      crossreference is not checked)

              Unify   Insert all entries of one BiB in another. If there are
                      key conflicts, a new key is generated by appending a
                      letter to the inserted key so the the new key is unique.

              Print   A LaTeX file with the entries of a BiB is created.

              Edit Macros
                      Open macro window for editing the macros of a BiB.

              Load Configuration
                      Load a configuration file.

       Options: Change default options

              Beep on Errors
                      Beep in case of an error (default: TRUE).

              Backup  Before writing a BiB on disk, a backup of the file with
                      the ending '.bak,i' is created, where is is a number so
                      that existing backups are not deleted (default: TRUE).

              Icons on Desktop
                      Icons of list and card windows are layed down on the
                      corresponding bibliography window (default: FALSE). This
                      option doesn't work with all window managers.

              Autom. Check
                      A consistency check takes place if a new BiB is loaded
                      (default: FALSE).

              Required Fields
                      When saving an entry, a warning is displayed if it
                      doesn't contain all fields required by
                       BibTeX (default: FALSE).

              Ignore Case
                      When searching for entries, uppercase/lowercase
                      distinctions are ignored during comparisons (default:
                      TRUE).

              Print As Bib
                      When printing a file, a LaTeX file containing 0cite
                      commands is created, otherwise the format of the LaTeX
                      file is fixed (default: TRUE).  The default style file
                      is alpha.  This default can be changed in the
                      [StyleFile] part of the configuration file.

              Display Error Window
                      An error window is displayed if a syntax error occurs
                      (default: FALSE).

       Window:

              Cascade The windows belonging to the same BiB (bibliography
                      window, macro window, card windows) are grouped
                      together. This doesn't work with all window managers.

       Help:
       Help texts are offered to the following topics:
              Survey
              Main Window
              Bibliography Window
              List Window

              Program Info


Bibliography Window
       The menu bar of the bibliography window contains functions for
       manipulating the corresponding BiB:


              New:    Create a new entry. The type of the entry must be chosen
                      from a pulldown menu. An entry of a type different from
                      the standard BibTeX types can be made with the item
                      'OwnType' of this menu. The type can be entered in the
                      field 'Owntype' of the card window.


              Search: Search for all entries that fullfill certain conditions.
                      A window is displayed in which for every field a regular
                      expression can be entered. The result of the search (the
                      entries that match all regular expressions) is shown in
                      the list window.
                      If a regular expression is entered in the field
                      Allfields, the entries matching the expression in any
                      field are displayed.
                      A search for user defined fields can be made by entering
                      a field name (no regular expression allowed, case not
                      ignored) and a regular expression.

              List:   All entries of the BiB are shown in the list window. The
                      card window is displayed after clicking the
                      corresponding entry.

              Macros: The macro window for editing STRING and PREAMBLE macros
                      is displayed.

              Print:  A LaTeX file with the entries of the list is created

              Save:   Save the BiB on disk. The BiB remains loaded.

              Close:  Close the BiB.


List Window
       The list window is displayed after clicking the menu item list of the
       bibliography window, as result of a search or as result of a
       consistency check. The menu bar of the list window offers the following
       commands:

              Save:   The entries of the list are saved as a new BiB.

              Sort:   The entries of the list are sorted. The way in which the
                      list is sorted can be chosen from a menu.

              Copy:   The entries of the list can be inserted into another
                      BiB.

              Print:  A LaTeX file with the entries of the list is created.

              Close:  The list window is closed.


Card Window
       The card window is used to create new entries or to edit existing
       entries.
       The field with the input focus has no border or (in the colour version)
       a red border. It can be moved using the <tab> and <esc> keys or by
       clicking the right button of the mouse in a field.
       You can change this behaviour in the resource file or in the file
       .bibviewrc.
       The contents of the fields are entered without the surrounding
       brackets. If you want to enter a macro, '@' or '#', you have to use a
       preceding '@'.
       You can change this behaviour in the resource file or in the file
       .bibviewrc.
       The menu bar of the card window offers the following commands:

              Duplicate:
                      A new card window is opened in which the field contents
                      (except mainkey) are taken from the actual card window.
                      The actual card window must have been saved, otherwise
                      the new card window is empty.

              User Data:
                      The card window is extended with the fields defined by
                      the user.

              Annote: The annote field of an entry can be edited in a window.

              Delete: The entry is deleted from the BiB.

              Save:   The entry is saved in the BiB.

              Copy:   The entry is copied into another BiB.

              Crossref:
                      Open the card that contains the entry pointed to by the
                      crossref field.

              Close:  Close the card window.


Macro Window
       The menu bar of the macro window offers the following commands:

              Save:   Save the macros and preambles of the macro window.

              Close:  Close the macro window.


Error Window
       The menu bar of the error window offers the following commands:

              Save:   Save the content of the error window.

              Close:  Close the error window.



Configuration File
       With the configuration file it is possible to customize bibview.  The
       standard configuration file is the file .bibviewrc in the home
       directory of the user. The configuration file can contain the following
       parts:
       [Options]: Lines of the form
     <option name> : <bool>
       can be used to set the default of the options.
       <option name> can be BeepOnError, IconsOnDesk, MakeBackups,
       AutoCheckBib, RequiredFields, IgnoreCase, PrintAsBib, Focus or
       DisplayErrWin.
       <bool> can be true or false.
       [Types]: This section of the configuration file is used to define new
       types, change existing types or add fields to all types.
       Type definitions start with lines of the form
     t : <type name>
       (define new type <type name> or add fields to the existing type <type
       name>)
     tc : <type name>
       (define new type <type name> or add fields to the existing type <type
       name>, clearing already defined fields)
     t : all
       (add the following fields to all defined types).
       A type definition is followed by a number of field definitions of the
       form
     f : <field name>
       (add <field name> to the newly defined type or to all types (if `all'
       is specified))
     rf : <field name>
       (add <field name> as required field to the newly defined type or to all
       types (if `all' is specified)).
       [UserFields]: This section is used to define user defined fields for
       certain types or for all types. It contains lines of the form
     <type name> : <field name>
       or
     all : <field name>
       [SortFields]: This section is used to define the fields by which a list
       can be sorted. A sort order can be specified.  The section contains
       lines of the form
     <field name>
       or
     <field name> : <sort order>
       If $clear$ is used as <field name>, all already defined sort fields are
       discarded.
       <sort order> can be n for names or d for dates.  If no sort order is
       specified, lexicographic order is used.
       [SearchFields]: This section is used to define the fields which are
       displayed in the search window.  The section contains lines of the form
     <field name>
       If $clear$ is used as <field name>, all already defined search fields
       are discarded.
       [ListFields]: This section is used to define the fields which are
       displayed in the list window and the layout of the list window.  The
       section contains lines of the form
     <field name> : <field width>
       <field name> can be mainkey, cardtype or the field names defined by
       BibTeX or in previous [Types] sections.
       <field width> is the number of characters that is used to display the
       field.
       [Predefines]: This section is used to define data that can be used in
       the search window. It contains lines of the form
     <field name> : <data>
       <field name> can be allfields, mainkey, cardtype or a field defined by
       BibTeX or in previous [Types] sections.
       [LatexHeader] and [LatexFooter]: In these sections header and footer of
       the LaTeX file produced by the Print command can be defined.
       [BibDir]: This section contains the absolute pathname of the directory
       where the BibTeX files are.
       [StyleFile]: This section contains the style file that is used in the
       LaTeX file produced by the Print command.
       [AnnoteField]: This section contains the name of the field with
       annotations.
       [SortedBy]: This section contains the name of the field by which a list
       is sorted by default.
       [Indent]: This section contains information concerning the layout of
       the BibTeX file produced by bibview.
       It contains lines of the form
     <parameter> : <number>
       <parameter> can be FldIndent (number of characters by which the field
       names are indented), ContIndent (number of characters by which the
       first line of the field content is indented), NewlineIndent (number of
       characters by which the following lines of the field content are
       indented) and MaxLinelen (maximum length of a line when printing files
       as LaTeX files with 0cite commands).
       The Options part is not evaluated if a configuration file is loaded by
       'Load Configuration'.  Options can be changed using the 'Options' menu.


Resource File
       The resources (width and height of windows, foreground, colours,
       texts,...) can be customized with a file BibView in the home directory.
       A sample file is included.


OPTIONS
       standard options:
       The standard options are -display, -geometry, -iconic and others.
       -file <bib file>:
       The BibTeX database <bib file> is loaded at the start of bibview.
       -rcfile <configuration file>:
       Instead of .bibviewrc in the home directory the file <configuration
       file> is used.
       -bibdir <directory>:
       A search for BibTeX files starts in <directory>.

LIMITATIONS
       Because of a bug in the Athena List Widget there are problems with
       files with more than ca. 1000 entries.  The consistency check is not
       sophisticated enough.  Entries are sorted only by BibTeX key.
       Ideas for more features are welcome.
