NAME
     pxe-pdhcp – An implementation of Preboot Execution Environment (PXE)
     server

SYNOPSIS
     pxe-pdhcp [-d] [-i interface] [-l listen_address] [-t tftp_address]
               [-b broadcast address] [nbp_name]

DESCRIPTION
     The pxe-pdhcp is an implementation of Preboot Execution Environment (PXE)
     server.  pxe-pdhcp works with DHCP server running on another host. The
     DHCP server doesn't need to be configured for any PXE specific options.
     This means that you can set up network boot environment without re-
     configuring existent DHCP server.

     pxe-pdhcp listens on two well-known ports (67/udp and 68/udp) so the root
     privilege is needed to run.

     With -d option, pxe-pdhcp runs on foreground.  This option is useful for
     debugging.

     Specify nework interface name (eth0 for example, on Linux) to -i option.

     If the network interface has more than one IP address, use -l, -t, -b
     options.  -i or (-l, -t and -b option) is required.

     Finally specify the path of Network Bootstrap Program on the TFTP server
     to nbp name option.  It will be pxelinux.0 if you are using PXELINUX.
