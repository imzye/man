NAME
     NFSv4 – NFS Version 4 Protocol

DESCRIPTION
     The NFS client and server provides support for the NFSv4 specification;
     see Network File System (NFS) Version 4 Protocol RFC 7530, Network File
     System (NFS) Version 4 Minor Version 1 Protocol RFC 5661, Network File
     System (NFS) Version 4 Minor Version 2 Protocol RFC 7862, File System
     Extended Attributes in NFSv4 RFC 8276 and Parallel NFS (pNFS) Flexible
     File Layout RFC 8435. The protocol is somewhat similar to NFS Version 3,
     but differs in significant ways.  It uses a single compound RPC that
     concatenates operations to-gether.  Each of these operations are similar
     to the RPCs of NFS Version 3.  The operations in the compound are
     performed in order, until one of them fails (returns an error) and then
     the RPC terminates at that point.

     It has integrated locking support, which implies that the server is no
     longer stateless.  As such, the NFSv4 server remains in recovery mode for
     a grace period (always greater than the lease duration the server uses)
     after a reboot.  During this grace period, clients may recover state but
     not perform other open/lock state changing operations.  To provide for
     correct recovery semantics, a small file described by stablerestart(5) is
     used by the server during the recovery phase.  If this file is missing or
     empty, there is a backup copy maintained by nfsd(8) that will be used.
     If either file is missing, they will be created by the nfsd(8).  If both
     the file and the backup copy are empty, it will result in the server
     starting without providing a grace period for recovery.  Note that
     recovery only occurs when the server machine is rebooted, not when the
     nfsd(8) are just restarted.

     It provides several optional features not present in NFS Version 3:

           - NFS Version 4 ACLs
           - Referrals, which redirect subtrees to other servers
             (not yet implemented)
           - Delegations, which allow a client to operate on a file locally
           - pNFS, where I/O operations are separated from Metadata operations
           And for NFSv4.2 only
           - User namespace extended attributes
           - lseek(SEEK_DATA/SEEK_HOLE)
           - File copying done locally on the server for copy_file_range(2)
           - posix_fallocate(2)
           - posix_fadvise(POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED/POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED)

     The NFSv4 protocol does not use a separate mount protocol and assumes
     that the server provides a single file system tree structure, rooted at
     the point in the local file system tree specified by one or more

           V4: <rootdir> [-sec=secflavors] [host(s) or net]

     line(s) in the exports(5) file.  (See exports(5) for details.)  The
     nfsd(8) allows a limited subset of operations to be performed on non-
     exported subtrees of the local file system, so that traversal of the tree
     to the exported subtrees is possible.  As such, the ``<rootdir>'' can be
     in a non-exported file system.  The exception is ZFS, which checks
     exports and, as such, all ZFS file systems below the ``<rootdir>'' must
     be exported.  However, the entire tree that is rooted at that point must
     be in local file systems that are of types that can be NFS exported.
     Since the NFSv4 file system is rooted at ``<rootdir>'', setting this to
     anything other than ``/'' will result in clients being required to use
     different mount paths for NFSv4 than for NFS Version 2 or 3.  Unlike NFS
     Version 2 and 3, Version 4 allows a client mount to span across multiple
     server file systems, although not all clients are capable of doing this.

     NFSv4 uses strings for users and groups instead of numbers.  On the wire,
     these strings can either have the numbers in the string or take the form:

           <user>@<dns.domain>

     where ``<dns.domain>'' is not the same as the DNS domain used for host
     name lookups, but is usually set to the same string.  Most systems set
     this ``<dns.domain>'' to the domain name part of the machine's
     hostname(1) by default.  However, this can normally be overridden by a
     command line option or configuration file for the daemon used to do the
     name<->number mapping.  Under FreeBSD, the mapping daemon is called
     nfsuserd(8) and has a command line option that overrides the domain
     component of the machine's hostname.  For use of this form of string on
     NFSv4, either client or server, this daemon must be running.

     The form where the numbers are in the strings can only be used for
     AUTH_SYS.  To configure your systems this way, the nfsuserd(8) daemon
     does not need to be running on the server, but the following sysctls need
     to be set to 1 on the server.

           vfs.nfs.enable_uidtostring
           vfs.nfsd.enable_stringtouid

     On the client, the sysctl

           vfs.nfs.enable_uidtostring

     must be set to 1 and the nfsuserd(8) daemon does not need to be running.

     If these strings are not configured correctly, ``ls -l'' will typically
     report a lot of ``nobody'' and ``nogroup'' ownerships.

     Although uid/gid numbers are no longer used in the NFSv4 protocol except
     optionally in the above strings, they will still be in the RPC
     authentication fields when using AUTH_SYS (sec=sys), which is the
     default.  As such, in this case both the user/group name and number
     spaces must be consistent between the client and server.

     However, if you run NFSv4 with RPCSEC_GSS (sec=krb5, krb5i, krb5p), only
     names and KerberosV tickets will go on the wire.

SERVER SETUP
     To set up the NFS server that supports NFSv4, you will need to set the
     variables in rc.conf(5) as follows:

           nfs_server_enable="YES"
           nfsv4_server_enable="YES"

     plus

           nfsuserd_enable="YES"

     if the server is using the ``<user>@<domain>'' form of user/group strings
     or is using the ``-manage-gids'' option for nfsuserd(8).

     You will also need to add at least one ``V4:'' line to the exports(5)
     file for NFSv4 to work.

     If the file systems you are exporting are only being accessed via NFSv4
     there are a couple of sysctl(8) variables that you can change, which
     might improve performance.

     vfs.nfsd.issue_delegations
             when set non-zero, allows the server to issue Open Delegations to
             clients.  These delegations permit the client to manipulate the
             file locally on the client.  Unfortunately, at this time, client
             use of delegations is limited, so performance gains may not be
             observed.  This can only be enabled when the file systems being
             exported to NFSv4 clients are not being accessed locally on the
             server and, if being accessed via NFS Version 2 or 3 clients,
             these clients cannot be using the NLM.

     vfs.nfsd.enable_locallocks
             can be set to 0 to disable acquisition of local byte range locks.
             Disabling local locking can only be done if neither local
             accesses to the exported file systems nor the NLM is operating on
             them.

     Note that Samba server access would be considered ``local access'' for
     the above discussion.

     To build a kernel with the NFS server that supports NFSv4 linked into it,
     the

           options NFSD

     must be specified in the kernel's config(5) file.

CLIENT MOUNTS
     To do an NFSv4 mount, specify the ``nfsv4'' option on the mount_nfs(8)
     command line.  This will force use of the client that supports NFSv4 plus
     set ``tcp'' and NFSv4.

     The nfsuserd(8) must be running if name<->uid/gid mapping is being used,
     as above.  Also, since an NFSv4 mount uses the host uuid to identify the
     client uniquely to the server, you cannot safely do an NFSv4 mount when

           hostid_enable="NO"

     is set in rc.conf(5).

     If the NFSv4 server that is being mounted on supports delegations, you
     can start the nfscbd(8) daemon to handle client side callbacks.  This
     will occur if

           nfsuserd_enable="YES"   <-- If name<->uid/gid mapping is being used.
           nfscbd_enable="YES"

     are set in rc.conf(5).

     Without a functioning callback path, a server will never issue
     Delegations to a client.

     For NFSv4.0, by default, the callback address will be set to the IP
     address acquired via rtalloc() in the kernel and port# 7745.  To override
     the default port#, a command line option for nfscbd(8) can be used.

     To get callbacks to work when behind a NAT gateway, a port for the
     callback service will need to be set up on the NAT gateway and then the
     address of the NAT gateway (host IP plus port#) will need to be set by
     assigning the sysctl(8) variable vfs.nfs.callback_addr to a string of the
     form:

     N.N.N.N.N.N

     where the first 4 Ns are the host IP address and the last two are the
     port# in network byte order (all decimal #s in the range 0-255).

     For NFSv4.1 and NFSv4.2, the callback path (called a backchannel) uses
     the same TCP connection as the mount, so none of the above applies and
     should work through gateways without any issues.

     To build a kernel with the client that supports NFSv4 linked into it, the
     option

           options NFSCL

     must be specified in the kernel's config(5) file.

     Options can be specified for the nfsuserd(8) and nfscbd(8) daemons at
     boot time via the ``nfsuserd_flags'' and ``nfscbd_flags'' rc.conf(5)
     variables.

     NFSv4 mount(s) against exported volume(s) on the same host are not
     recommended, since this can result in a hung NFS server.  It occurs when
     an nfsd thread tries to do an NFSv4 VOP_RECLAIM() / Close RPC as part of
     acquiring a new vnode.  If all other nfsd threads are blocked waiting for
     lock(s) held by this nfsd thread, then there isn't an nfsd thread to
     service the Close RPC.

BUGS
     At this time, there is no recall of delegations for local file system
     operations.  As such, delegations should only be enabled for file systems
     that are being used solely as NFS export volumes and are not being
     accessed via local system calls nor services such as Samba.
