Devel::Leak::Object(3)                     User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Devel::Leak::Object - Detect leaks of objects

VERSION
       version 1.02

SYNOPSIS
         # Track a single object
         use Devel::Leak::Object;
         my $obj = Foo::Bar->new;
         Devel::Leak::Object::track($obj);

         # Track every object
         use Devel::Leak::Object qw{ GLOBAL_bless };

         # Track every object including where they're created
         use Devel::Leak::Object qw{ GLOBAL_bless };
         $Devel::Leak::Object::TRACKSOURCELINES = 1;

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides tracking of objects, for the purpose of detecting
       memory leaks due to circular references or inappropriate caching
       schemes.

       Object tracking can be enabled on a per object basis. Any objects thus
       tracked are remembered until DESTROYed; details of any objects left are
       printed out to STDERR at END-time.

         use Devel::Leak::Object qw(GLOBAL_bless);

       This form overloads bless to track construction and destruction of all
       objects. As an alternative, by importing bless, you can just track the
       objects of the caller code that is doing the use.

       If you use GLOBAL_bless to overload the bless function, please note
       that it will ONLY apply to bless for modules loaded AFTER
       Devel::Leak::Object has enabled the hook.

       Any modules already loaded will have already bound to CORE::bless and
       will not be impacted.

       Setting the global variable $Devel::Leak::Object::TRACKSOURCELINES
       makes the report at the end include where (filename and line number)
       each leaked object originates (or where call to the ::new is made).
