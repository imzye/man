tpm2(1)                     General Commands Manual                    tpm2(1)

NAME
       tpm2(1) - A single small executable that combines the various
       tpm2-tools much like a BusyBox that provides a fairly complete
       environment for any small or embedded system.

SYNOPSIS
       tpm2 [OPTIONS] [ARGUMENTS]

DESCRIPTION
       tpm2(1) - To ease installation of tpm2-tools in initrd or embedded
       systems where size-optimization and limited resources are important, it
       is convenient to have a single executable that can dispatch the various
       TPM2 functionalities specified by the argument which is one of the
       available tool names.

       The options and arguments that follow are either the common options or
       those specific to the tool name.

       It is important to note that individual tools with prefix tpm2_ can
       still be invoked, however, they are now soft-linked to this tpm2
       executable.  And so unlike BusyBox, full functionality of the
       individual tools is available in the executable.  For example:
       tpm2_getrandom 8 can alternatively be specified as tpm2 getrandom 8.

ARGUMENTS
       List of possible tool names.  NOTE: Specify only one of these.  Look at
       examples.

COMMON OPTIONS
       This collection of options are common to many programs and provide
       information that many users may expect.

       • -h, --help=[man|no-man]: Display the tools manpage.  By default, it
         attempts to invoke the manpager for the tool, however, on failure
         will output a short tool summary.  This is the same behavior if the
         “man” option argument is specified, however if explicit “man” is
         requested, the tool will provide errors from man on stderr.  If the
         “no-man” option if specified, or the manpager fails, the short
         options will be output to stdout.

         To successfully use the manpages feature requires the manpages to be
         installed or on MANPATH, See man(1) for more details.

       • -v, --version: Display version information for this tool, supported
         tctis and exit.

       • -V, --verbose: Increase the information that the tool prints to the
         console during its execution.  When using this option the file and
         line number are printed.

       • -Q, --quiet: Silence normal tool output to stdout.

       • -Z, --enable-errata: Enable the application of errata fixups.  Useful
         if an errata fixup needs to be applied to commands sent to the TPM.
         Defining the environment TPM2TOOLS_ENABLE_ERRATA is equivalent.
         information many users may expect.

TCTI Configuration
       The TCTI or “Transmission Interface” is the communication mechanism
       with the TPM.  TCTIs can be changed for communication with TPMs across
       different mediums.

       To control the TCTI, the tools respect:

       1. The command line option -T or --tcti

       2. The environment variable: TPM2TOOLS_TCTI.

       Note: The command line option always overrides the environment
       variable.

       The current known TCTIs are:

       • tabrmd - The resource manager, called tabrmd
         (https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-abrmd).  Note that tabrmd and
         abrmd as a tcti name are synonymous.

       • mssim - Typically used for communicating to the TPM software
         simulator.

       • device - Used when talking directly to a TPM device file.

       • none - Do not initalize a connection with the TPM.  Some tools allow
         for off-tpm options and thus support not using a TCTI.  Tools that do
         not support it will error when attempted to be used without a TCTI
         connection.  Does not support ANY options and MUST BE presented as
         the exact text of “none”.

       The arguments to either the command line option or the environment
       variable are in the form:

       <tcti-name>:<tcti-option-config>

       Specifying an empty string for either the <tcti-name> or
       <tcti-option-config> results in the default being used for that portion
       respectively.

   TCTI Defaults
       When a TCTI is not specified, the default TCTI is searched for using
       dlopen(3) semantics.  The tools will search for tabrmd, device and
       mssim TCTIs IN THAT ORDER and USE THE FIRST ONE FOUND.  You can query
       what TCTI will be chosen as the default by using the -v option to print
       the version information.  The “default-tcti” key-value pair will
       indicate which of the aforementioned TCTIs is the default.

   Custom TCTIs
       Any TCTI that implements the dynamic TCTI interface can be loaded.  The
       tools internally use dlopen(3), and the raw tcti-name value is used for
       the lookup.  Thus, this could be a path to the shared library, or a
       library name as understood by dlopen(3) semantics.

TCTI OPTIONS
       This collection of options are used to configure the various known TCTI
       modules available:

       • device: For the device TCTI, the TPM character device file for use by
         the device TCTI can be specified.  The default is /dev/tpm0.

         Example: -T device:/dev/tpm0 or export
         TPM2TOOLS_TCTI=“device:/dev/tpm0”

       • mssim: For the mssim TCTI, the domain name or IP address and port
         number used by the simulator can be specified.  The default are
         127.0.0.1 and 2321.

         Example: -T mssim:host=localhost,port=2321 or export
         TPM2TOOLS_TCTI=“mssim:host=localhost,port=2321”

       • abrmd: For the abrmd TCTI, the configuration string format is a
         series of simple key value pairs separated by a `,' character.  Each
         key and value string are separated by a `=' character.

         • TCTI abrmd supports two keys:

           1. `bus_name' : The name of the tabrmd service on the bus (a
              string).

           2. `bus_type' : The type of the dbus instance (a string) limited to
              `session' and `system'.

         Specify the tabrmd tcti name and a config string of
         bus_name=com.example.FooBar:


                \--tcti=tabrmd:bus_name=com.example.FooBar


         Specify the default (abrmd) tcti and a config string of
         bus_type=session:


                \--tcti:bus_type=session


         NOTE: abrmd and tabrmd are synonymous.  the various known TCTI
         modules.

EXAMPLES
   Get 8 rand bytes from the TPM

              tpm2 getrandom 8 | xxd -p


   Send a TPM Startup Command with flags TPM2_SU_CLEAR

              tpm2 startup -c


Returns
       Tools can return any of the following codes:

       • 0 - Success.

       • 1 - General non-specific error.

       • 2 - Options handling error.

       • 3 - Authentication error.

       • 4 - TCTI related error.

       • 5 - Non supported scheme.  Applicable to tpm2_testparams.
