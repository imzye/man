DESCRIPTION
     clive is a console client for the LiveJournal system.  It doesn't offer
     much in the way of features.  It's strength lies in the ability to pipe
     the text for an entry into it on stdin, thus allowing it to be used
     filter-style. It an also lauch your preferred editor to type entries.  It
     allows for users to login and post/read/replace events, and that's it.

OPTIONS
     -u username
     --user=username
             Specify the username
     -w password
     --password=password
             Specify the password
     -j journal
     --usejournal=journal
             Specify the journal to use, if different from the username.  You
             can also use the associated ID number obtainable with --laccess.
     -s subject
     --subject=subject
             The subject of the post.  This will disable interactive entry of
             the subject.
     -r level
     --security=level
             Clive defaults to public security, unless specified otherwise.
             This option is how you do that from the command line.  See the
             SECURITY section below for a description of that spec.
     -f mood
     --mood=mood
             LiveJournal allows you to display a mood along with your post Use
             this option to set it.  Use quotes if you want to have whitespace
             in your mood.
     -m music
     --music=music
             Describe the music you are listening to while writing this entry.
             Use quotes if you want to have whitespace in your music title.
     -l location
     --location=location
             Describe where you are writing this entry (e.g. the name of your
             town).
     -t tag[,tag,...]
     --taglist tag[,tag,...]
             Add tags to categorise this entry.  Multiple tags must be
             separated by commas.
     -i keyword
     --userpic keyword
             Many users have more than one user picture, you can specify which
             one you would like to use here.  You can either use the picture
             keyword, or the ID as specified by --lpic.
     -p
     --preformat
             This will tell LiveJournal that we are sending preformatted text.
             This is useful if you have a lot of HTML in it.
     -d
     --nocomments
             This will tell LiveJournal to disable comments on this post.
     -v
     --version
             Display Clive version details and exit.
     --help  Display a short usage statement.
     --backdate YYYYMMDDhhmm
             Back date the item to year YYYY, month MM, day DD, hour hh,
             minute mm.  This will insert it into your journal at that date,
             and it will prevent the post from showing on other users' friends
             pages.
     --replace=itemid
             Replace an existing entry. The itemid can be obtained by running
             with --levents first. Note that not just the entire text, but all
             settings of the post will be overridden, so you should use
             --backdate to reuse the old date. To delete an existing entry,
             just leave the event text empty.
     --charset=encoding
             Specify the local character set (e.g.  ‘utf-8’, ‘iso8859-2’,
             ‘koi8-r’).  By default, the characterset is automatically
             detected (from environment variables and system settings). Use
             this option to override the detected value. This option can be
             set in the configuration file.
     --plainpass
             Clive, by default, uses a challenge-response system to verify
             your password.  If you use this option, it will send your
             password as plaintext.  Use of this option is not recommended.
     --hashpass
             Clive, by default, uses a challenge-response system to verify
             your password. If you use this option, it will send an MD5 hash
             of your password to the server. Which is faster, but not very
             secure.  Use of this option is not recommended,
     --softreturn
             This will collapse multiple lines to a single long line. A new
             paragraph can still be started with an empty line in the text. In
             general this will generate pretier output on the website. This
             option can be set in the configuration file.
     --lfrgp
             This will display a list of your friends groups with their
             associated ID numbers.
     --laccess
             This will display a list of the journals you have access to and
             their associated ID numbers. If you join or leave a community,
             these numbers will change.
     --lpic  This will dislpay a list of your userpics and their associated
             IDs.  If you make any changes to your user pictures, the IDs
             displayed may change.
     --lfriends
             This will display a list of your friends and their birthdays (if
             set).
     --addfriend name
             Add a new friend. It is not an error to add an existing friend.
     --delfriend name
             Delete a friend. It is not an error to delete an already non-
             existing friend.
     --levents[=num]
             This will display a list of the num most recent journal entries.
             If no argument is given, it will only show the ID, timestamp and
             subject of the most recent entry.
     --loginonly
     --nologin
             These options control the behavior of clive with respect to
             logging into the LJ server. Logging in allows you to retrieve any
             user-specific information such as friend groups. If you wish to
             just login, use --loginonly.  If you don't want to login at all
             use --nologin.

FILES
     ~/.cliverc
             Your personal configuration file, you can set most options in
             here so that you don't have to pass them in on the command line.

SECURITY
     LiveJournal has a variety of security settings: public, private, and
     custom.  Clive supports all of these through the [-r] or [--security]
     option.  Posts default to public security unless set on the commandline.
     Here are the different security levels and how to specify them.

     ‘private’
             Pass either ‘1’ or ‘private’ as the argument, and you will be the
             only person that can view your post.

     ‘friends’
             Pass either ‘2’ or ‘friends’ as the argument, and your post will
             only be viewable by the LiveJournal users you list as friends.

     ‘custom’
             LiveJournal allows you to specify up to 30 different friend
             groups, and you can set your post readable by different groups.
             The way to construct a security spec for a custom setting is to
             start with a ‘:’ and then put in the name (e.g.
             ‘:closefriends’).  If you want to use multiple filters, continue
             separating with colons.  To include whitespace, use quotes.
             (e.g.  ‘:schoolfriends:2:"Default View"’)

HEADERS
     It's annoying when you're editing a posting and realize another subject,
     or mood description might be more appropriate. It is now possible to set
     these in the posting itself by adding so called headers. If your posting
     starts with lines containing special keywords followed by a colon and
     value, these will be treated as special meta-information instead of the
     body of your posting. For example currently available headers are:

           Subject: An example posting
           Mood: happy
           Music: EAV - Ding Dong
           Taglist: example,first post,test

     These headers should be separated from the content of your posting by an
     empty line.

CONFIGURATION
     We understand that it can be annoying to pass in half a dozen command
     line options every time you want to post to LiveJournal, so we allow you
     to have a configuration file that specifies all of these.  You can
     specify key value pairs in your .cliverc for any of the command line
     options that take values. Each pair should go on a line of it's own. Any
     whitespace before and after the key or value is ignored. Lines that begin
     with ‘#’ are also ignored.  Each pair should look like this:
           key = value

ENVIRONMENT
     VISUAL
     EDITOR  The name for the external editor to use. If VISUAL is set, this
             will be preferred. If neither variable is set, a very lame built-
             in editor will be used  This can be overriden in the
             configuration file.
