DWARF_ADD_ARANGE(3)    FreeBSD Library Functions Manual    DWARF_ADD_ARANGE(3)

NAME
     dwarf_add_arange, dwarf_add_arange_b – add address range information to a
     DWARF producer instance

LIBRARY
     DWARF Access Library (libdwarf, -ldwarf)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <libdwarf.h>

     Dwarf_Unsigned
     dwarf_add_arange(Dwarf_P_Debug dbg, Dwarf_Addr start,
         Dwarf_Unsigned length, Dwarf_Signed symbol_index, Dwarf_Error *err);

     Dwarf_Unsigned
     dwarf_add_arange_b(Dwarf_P_Debug dbg, Dwarf_Addr start,
         Dwarf_Unsigned length, Dwarf_Unsigned symbol_index,
         Dwarf_Unsigned end_symbol_index, Dwarf_Addr offset_from_end_symbol,
         Dwarf_Error *err);

DESCRIPTION
     Function dwarf_add_arange_b() adds an address range entry to a producer
     instance.

     Argument dbg should reference a DWARF producer instance allocated using
     dwarf_producer_init(3) or dwarf_producer_init_b(3).

     Argument start specifies the relocatable start address of the address
     range.

     Argument length specifies the length of the address range.

     Argument symbol_index specifies the ELF symbol index of the first symbol
     to be used for relocation.

     Argument end_symbol_index specifies the ELF symbol index of the second
     symbol to be used for relocation.

     •   If argument end_symbol_index is not 0, the
         DW_DLC_SYMBOLIC_RELOCATIONS flag should have been set on the DWARF
         producer instance.  The address value specified by argument start
         will be treated as an offset value from the first symbol, and the
         argument offset_from_end_symbol should hold an offset value from the
         second symbol.  Application code can retrieve the relocation entries
         for the symbol pair by calling function dwarf_get_relocation_info(3).
         The relocation entry for the first symbol will have type
         dwarf_drt_first_of_length_pair and the relocation entry for the
         second symbol will have type dwarf_drt_second_of_length_pair.

     •   If argument end_symbol_index is 0, argument offset_from_end_symbol
         will be ignored and only one symbol is used for relocation.

     If argument err is not NULL, it will be used to store error information
     in case of an error.

     Function dwarf_add_arange() is deprecated.  It is similar to function
     dwarf_add_arange_b() except that it cannot handle all possible symbol
     index values and supports only one relocation symbol.

RETURN VALUES
     On success, these functions return a non-zero value.  In case of an
     error, these functions return 0 and set the argument err.

ERRORS
     These functions can fail with:

     [DW_DLE_ARGUMENT]       Argument dbg was NULL.

     [DW_DLE_ARGUMENT]       Argument end_symbol_index was non-zero, but the
                             flag DW_DLC_SYMBOLIC_RELOCATIONS was not set on
                             the producer instance.

     [DW_DLE_MEMORY]         An out of memory condition was encountered during
                             the execution of the function.
