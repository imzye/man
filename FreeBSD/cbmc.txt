       Only the most useful options are listed here; see below for the
       remainder.

DESCRIPTION
       cbmc generates traces that demonstrate how an assertion can be
       violated, or proves that the assertion cannot be violated within a
       given number of loop iterations.  CBMC can read C/C++ source-code
       directly, or a GOTO binary generated by goto-cc.  Java programs are
       given as class or JAR files.  Without any further options, cbmc checks
       all properties (automatically generated or user-specified) found in the
       program.  If any of the properties can be violated, a counterexample is
       printed and the analysis is aborted.  The analysis can be restricted to
       a particular property with the --property option.  The verification
       result for all properties can be obtained by means of the --all-
       properties option.

       goto-cc(1) reads source code, and generates a GOTO binary. Its command-
       line interface is designed to mimic that of gcc(1).  Note in particular
       that goto-cc(1) distinguishes between compiling and linking phases,
       just as gcc does. cbmc expects a GOTO binary for which linking has been
       completed.

       goto-instrument(1) reads a GOTO binary, performs a given program
       transformation, and then writes the resulting program as GOTO binary on
       disc.

       The usual flow is to (1) translate source into a GOTO binary using
       goto-cc, then (2) perform instrumentation with goto-instrument, and
       finally (3) perform the analysis with cbmc.

OPTIONS
   Standard Checks
       From version 6.0 onwards, cbmc, goto-analyzer and some other tools
       apply some checks to the program by default (called the "standard
       checks"), with the aim to provide a better user experience for a non-
       expert user of the tool. These checks are:

       --pointer-check
              enable pointer checks

       --bounds-check
              enable array bounds checks

       --undefined-shift-check
              check shift greater than bit-width

       --div-by-zero-check
              enable division by zero checks for integer division

       --float-div-by-zero-check
              enable division by zero checks for floating-point division

       --pointer-primitive-check
              checks that all pointers in pointer primitives are valid or null

       --signed-overflow-check
              enable signed arithmetic over- and underflow checks

       --malloc-may-fail
              allow malloc calls to return a null pointer

       --malloc-fail-null
              set malloc failure mode to return null

       --unwinding-assertions
              generate unwinding assertions (cannot be used with --cover)

       These checks can all be deactivated at once by using the
       --no-standard-checks flag like in the header example, or individually,
       by prepending a no- before the flag, like so:

       --no-pointer-check
              disable pointer checks

       --no-bounds-check
              disable array bounds checks

       --no-undefined-shift-check
              do not perform check for shift greater than bit-width

       --no-div-by-zero-check
              disable division by zero checks

       --no-pointer-primitive-check
              do not check that all pointers in pointer primitives are valid
              or null

       --no-signed-overflow-check
              disable signed arithmetic over- and underflow checks

       --no-malloc-may-fail
              do not allow malloc calls to fail by default

       --no-unwinding-assertions
              do not generate unwinding assertions

       If an already set flag is re-set, like calling --pointer-check when
       default checks are already on, the flag is simply ignored.

   Analysis options:
       --no-standard-checks
              disable the standard (default) checks applied to a C/GOTO

              give a counterexample trace for failed properties

       --stop-on-fail
              stop analysis once a failed property is detected (implies

              applied to array, the default is 64

       --no-array-field-sensitivity

              permit paths that execute loops only partially (up to the given
              unwinding bound) and then continue beyond the loop even when the
              loop condition would still hold (such paths may be spurious,
              resulting in false alarms)

       --no-self-loops-to-assumptions

       used by cbmc will use environment variables to locate header files.
