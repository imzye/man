YPSET(8)                FreeBSD System Manager's Manual               YPSET(8)

NAME
     ypset – tell ypbind(8) which NIS server process to use

SYNOPSIS
     ypset [-h host] [-d domain] server

DESCRIPTION
     The ypset utility tells the ypbind(8) process on the current machine
     which NIS server process to communicate with.  If server is down or is
     not running a NIS server process, it is not discovered until a NIS client
     process attempts to access a NIS map, at which time ypbind(8) tests the
     binding and takes appropriate action.

     The ypset utility is most useful for binding a NIS client that is not on
     the same broadcast network as the closest NIS server, but can also be
     used for debugging a local network's NIS configuration, testing specific
     NIS client programs, or binding to a specific server when there are many
     servers on the local network supplying NIS maps.

     The options are as follows:

     -d domain
             Use the NIS domain domain instead of the default domain as
             returned by domainname(1).

     -h host
             Set the NIS binding on host instead of the local machine.
