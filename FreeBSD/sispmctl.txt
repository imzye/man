DESCRIPTION
       sispmctl is a tool to switch the outlets of USB controlled powerstrips.
       Supported models include:

       EnerGenie
              EG-PM, EG-PMS, EG-PM2, EG-PMS2

       Gembird Silver Shield
              MSIS-PM, SIS-PM, SIS-PMS

       The tool requires the libusb 0.1 userspace USB programming library.


OPTIONS
       -h     print usage information

       -s     scan for supported GEMBIRD devices

       -l     daemonize and start listening as a simple http webserver
              (default port: 2638)

       -L     start listening as a simple http webserver without daemonizing

       -p     IP network port (default: 2638) for listener. A web-user and
              password can be defined in /etc/sispmctl/password.

       -u     give the directory path where pages lie, that are served
              (default: /usr/local/share/doc/sispmctl/skin.  The Web path
              component is completely ignored for security reasons.

       -b     switch the buzzer on and off

       -o     switch the given outlet(s) to "ON"

       -f     switch the given outlet(s) to "OFF"

       -t     toggle the state of the given outlet(s)

       -g     show the status of the given outlet(s)

       -m     get power supply status for the given outlet(s)

       -d     Use not the first but the given device in the sequence of
              detected devices, starting with "0" for the first device (see
              scan option)

       -D     Same as -d, but choose by serial number (see scan option)

       -U     Same as -d, but choose by USB Bus:Device the device is connected
              to (e.g. 001:003)

       -n     do not print "ON" and "OFF", but "1" and "0" instead

       -q     do neither print explanations nor disclaimers except it is
              requested

       -a     get schedule for given outlet

       -A     set schedule for given outlet
              --Aat date     - sets an event time as a date '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'
              in the current local time zone (not considering day light saving
              time switches)
              --Aafter N     - sets an event time as N minutes after the
              previous one
              --Ado <on|off> - sets the current event's action
              --Aloop N      - loops to 1st event's action after N minutes

       -v     print version & copyright


WEB INTERFACE
       The sispmctl program provides a web interface when started with the -l
       option. No additional http server is needed.  Each selected usb device
       is blocked by sispmctl while running.

       After installation, the first of two web-interfaces is selected.  The
       default location of the HTML files is
       /usr/local/share/doc/sispmctl/skin which is a symbolic link to
       /usr/local/shared/doc/sispmctl/httpd/skin1.

       The HTTP capabilities of sispmctl are limited.  Technically speaking,
       only the first line of each HTTP request is parsed.  The terminating
       path component, i.e. file name, is looked up in the repository
       directory.  If present the file is parsed and in absence of control
       sequences sent as is.  The files must include the HTTP header portion.

       Control sequences start and end with double dollar `$$'.

       To display the version of the software use $$version()$$.  Other
       control sequences consist of a command portion separated by a question
       mark `?' from alternative outputs which are separated by the first
       colon `:'.  The command portion is a token followed by an embraced
       number that references the outlet, e.g.
       $$command(1)?positive:negative$$ while command is one of status,
       toggle, on or off.  It is advisable to avoid the on/off/toggle commands
       in pages that may be reloaded.  Best is to redirect to other pages that
       only include status requests.


SCHEDULING
       The sispmctl allows to define schedules. Schedules can be used to turn
       given outlets of the device "ON" or "OFF" at or after a given time.
       Schedules can also be set to loop after a given number of minutes.

       To show the schedule for a given outlet use the option -a and specify
       the wanted outlet(s). The option -A plus any of the options --Aat ,
       --Aafter , --Ado and --Aloop will create a new schedule for the given
       output. If only -A plus an outlet is called, the schedule for the
       outlet will be deleted.



EXAMPLES
       Switch off the first outlet of the first SiS-PM and the third outlet of
       the second SiS-PM:

       sispmctl -f 1 -d 1 -f 3

       Print the status of the forth outlet as zero or one:

       sispmctl -nqg 4

       Set a schedule so outlet 2 on the first device gets turned "ON" on the
       given date and time:

       sispmctl -A 2 --Aat '2011-07-27 20:45' --Ado on

       Set a schedule so outlet 3 on the second device gets turned "ON" after
       2 minutes and "OFF" after another 10 minutes. The schedule will loop
       after 1 hour:

       sispmctl -d 1 -A 3 --Aafter 2 --Ado on --Aafter 10 --Ado off --Aloop 60

       Run sispmctl on the second device as a web server:

       sispmctl -d 1 -l

       You can connect to it from the same machine by pointing to
       http://localhost:2638 with your web browser.

       Run sispmctl as a web server on the interface with address
       192.168.1.42, port 4242 using skin2:

       sispmctl -i 192.168.1.42 -p 4242 -u
       /usr/local/share/doc/sispmctl/httpd/skin2/ -l
