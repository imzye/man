Find::Lib(3)          User Contributed Perl Documentation         Find::Lib(3)


NAME
       Find::Lib - Helper to smartly find libs to use in the filesystem tree

VERSION
       Version 1.01

SYNOPSIS
           #!/usr/bin/perl -w;
           use strict;

           ## simple usage
           use Find::Lib '../mylib';

           ## more libraries
           use Find::Lib '../mylib', 'local-lib';

           ## More verbose and backward compatible with Find::Lib < 1.0
           use Find::Lib libs => [ 'lib', '../lib', 'devlib' ];

           ## resolve some path with minimum typing
           $dir  = Find::Lib->catdir("..", "data");
           $path = Find::Lib->catfile("..", "data", "test.yaml");

           $base = Find::Lib->base;
           # or
           $base = Find::Lib::Base;

DESCRIPTION
       The purpose of this module is to replace

           use FindBin;
           use lib "$FindBin::Bin/../bootstrap/lib";

       with something shorter. This is specially useful if your project has a
       lot of scripts (For instance tests scripts).

           use Find::Lib '../bootstrap/lib';

       The important differences between FindBin and Find::Lib are:

       •   symlinks and '..'

           If you have symlinks in your path it respects them, so basically
           you can forget you have symlinks, because Find::Lib will do the
           natural thing (NOT ignore them), and resolve '..' correctly.
           FindBin breaks if you do:

               use lib "$Bin/../lib";

           and you currently are in a symlinked directory, because $Bin
           resolved to the filesystem path (without the symlink) and not the
           shell path.

       •   convenience

           it's faster too type, and more intuitive (Exporting $Bin always
           felt weird to me).

DISCUSSION
   Installation and availability of this module
       The usefulness of this module is seriously reduced if Find::Lib is not
       already in your @INC / $ENV{PERL5LIB} -- Chicken and egg problem. This
       is the big disavantage of FindBin over Find::Lib: FindBin is
       distributed with Perl. To mitigate that, you need to be sure of global
       availability of the module in the system (You could install it via your
       favorite package managment system for instance).

   modification of $0 and chdir (BEGIN blocks, other 'use')
       As soon as Find::Lib is compiled it saves the location of the script
       and the initial cwd (current working directory), which are the two
       pieces of information the module relies on to interpret the relative
       path given by the calling program.

       If one of cwd, $ENV{PWD} or $0 is changed before Find::Lib has a chance
       to do its job, then Find::Lib will most probably die, saying "The
       script cannot be found". I don't know a workaround that. So be sure to
       load Find::Lib as soon as possible in your script to minimize problems
       (you are in control!).

       (some programs alter $0 to customize the display line of the process in
       the system process-list ("ps" on unix).

       (Note, see perlvar for explanation of $0)

USAGE
   import
       All the work is done in import. So you need to 'use Find::Lib' and pass
       a list of paths to add to @INC. See "BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY" section
       for more retails on this topic.

       The paths given are (should) be relative to the location of the current
       script.  The paths won't be added unless the path actually exists on
       disk

   base
       Returns the detected base (the directory where the script lives in).
       It's a string, and is the same as $Find::Lib::Base.

   catfile
       A shorcut to File::Spec::catfile using Find::Lib's base.

   catdir
       A shorcut to File::Spec::catdir using Find::Lib's base.

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
       in versions <1.0 of Find::Lib, the import arguments allowed you to
       specify a Bootstrap package. This option is now removed breaking
       backward compatibility. I'm sorry about that, but that was a dumb idea
       of mine to save more typing. But it saves, like, 3 characters at the
       expense of readability. So, I'm sure I didn't break anybody, because
       probabaly no one was relying on a stupid behaviour.

       However, the multiple libs argument passing is kept intact: you can
       still use:

           use Find::Lib libs => [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ];

       where "libs" is a reference to a list of path to add to @INC.

       The short forms implies that the first argument passed to import is not
       "libs" or "pkgs". An example of usage is given in the SYNOPSIS section.
