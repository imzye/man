NAME
       aide - Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment

SYNOPSIS
       aide [parameters] command

DESCRIPTION
       AIDE is an intrusion detection system for checking the integrity of
       files.


COMMANDS
       --check, -C
              Checks the database for inconsistencies. You must have an
              initialized database to do this. This is also the default
              command. Without any command aide does a check.

       --init, -i
              Initialize the database. You must initialize a database and move
              it to the appropriate place (see database_in config option)
              before you can use the --check command.

       --dry-init, -n (added in AIDE v0.17)
              Traverse the file system, match each file against the rule tree
              and report to stdout.

              Neither reports nor the database are written in this mode.

              To change the log level in this mode please use the --log-level
              command line parameter.

              In this mode aide exits with status 0.


       --update, -u
              Checks the database and updates the database non-interactively.
              The input and output databases must be different.

       --compare, -E
              Compares two databases. They must be defined in config file with
              database=<url> and database_new=<url>.

       --config-check, -D
              Stops after reading in the configuration file. Any errors will
              be reported.  To change the log level in this mode please use
              the --log-level command line parameter.

       --path-check=file_type:path, -p file_type:path (added in AIDE v0.17)
              Read configuration and match provided file_type and path against
              rule tree. The path is independent of what is in the actual file
              system and needs to be absolute. See RESTRICTED RULES section in
              aide.conf (5) for supported file types.

              To change the log level in this mode please use the --log-level
              command line parameter.

              In this mode aide exits with status 0 if the file would be added
              to the tree, 1 if not and 2 if the file does not match a
              specified limit.


PARAMETERS
       --config=configfile , -c configfile
              Configuration is read from file configfile (see --version output
              for default value).  Use '-' for stdin.

       --limit=REGEX , -l REGEX (added in AIDE v0.16)
              Limit command to entries matching REGEX. Note that the REGEX
              only matches at the first position.

              Example
                 Only check and update the database entries matching /etc
                 (i.e. the /etc directory) while leaving all other entries
                 unchecked and unchanged:

                    aide --update --limit /etc


       --before="configparameters" , -B "configparameters"
              These configparameters are handled before the reading of the
              configuration file. See aide.conf (5) for more details on what
              to put here.

       --after="configparameters" , -A "configparameters"
              These configparameters are handled after the reading of the
              configuration file. See aide.conf (5) for more details on what
              to put here.

       --log-level=log_level,-Llog_level (added in AIDE v0.17)
              The log level to use (see aide.conf (5) for available log levels
              and more details).  This overwrites the log_level value set in
              any configuration file.

       --verbose=verbosity_level,-Vverbosity_level (REMOVED in AIDE v0.17)
              Removed, use log_level and report_level config options instead
              (see aide.conf (5) for details).

       --report=reporter,-r reporter (REMOVED in AIDE v0.17)
              Removed, use report_url config option instead (see aide.conf (5)
              for details).

       --workers=WORKERS , -W WORKERS (added in AIDE v0.18)
              Specifies the number of workers (see aide.conf (5) for details).
              This overwrites the num_workers value set in any configuration
              file.

       --version,-v
              Print version information and exit.

       --help,-h
              Prints out the standard help message.

EXIT STATUS
       Normally, the exit status is 0 if no errors occurred. Except when the
       --check, --compare or --update command was requested, in which case the
       exit status is defined as:

       1 * (new files reported?)     +

       2 * (removed files reported?) +

       4 * (changed files reported?)

       Since those three cases can occur together, the respective error codes
       are added. For example, if there are new files and removed files
       reported, the exit status will be 1 + 2 = 3.

       Additionally, the following exit codes are defined for generic error
       conditions:

       14 Writing error

       15 Invalid argument error

       16 Unimplemented function error

       17 Configuration error

       18 IO error

       19 Version mismatch error

       20 EXEC error

       21 File lock error

       22 Memory allocation error

       23 Thread error

SIGNAL HANDLING
       SIGTERM is ignored, use SIGKILL to terminate aide.

       SIGHUP is also ignored.

       SIGUSR1 toggles the log_level between current and debug level.

NOTES
       The checksums in the database and in the output are by default base64
       encoded (see also report_base16 option).  To decode them you can use
       the following shell command:

       echo <encoded_checksum> | base64 -d | hexdump -v -e '32/1 "%02x" "\n"'


FILES
       See --version output for the default config file and the default
       database_in and database_out config values.
