VTYSH(1)                        Version 0.96.5                        VTYSH(1)

NAME
       vtysh - a integrated shell for Quagga routing software

SYNOPSIS
       vtysh [ -b ]
       vtysh [ -E ] [ -d daemon ] ] [ -c command ]

DESCRIPTION
       vtysh is a integrated shell for Quagga routing engine.

OPTIONS
       Options available for the vtysh command:

       -b, --boot
              Execute boot startup configuration. It makes sense only if
              integrated config file is in use (not default in Quagga). See
              Info file Quagga for more info.

       -c, --command command
              Specify command to be executed under batch mode. It behaves like
              -c option in any other shell - command is executed and vtysh
              exits.

              It's useful for gathering info from Quagga routing software or
              reconfiguring daemons from inside shell scripts, etc.  Note that
              multiple commands may be executed by using more than one -c
              option and/or embedding linefeed characters inside the command
              string.

       -d, --daemon daemon_name
              Specify which daemon to connect to.  By default, vtysh attempts
              to connect to all Quagga daemons running on the system.  With
              this flag, one can specify a single daemon to connect to
              instead.  For example, specifying '-d ospfd' will connect only
              to ospfd.  This can be particularly useful inside scripts with
              -c where the command is targeted for a single daemon.

       -e, --execute command
              Alias for -c. It's here only for compatibility with Zebra
              routing software and older Quagga versions. This will be removed
              in future.

       -E, --echo
              When the -c option is being used, this flag will cause the
              standard vtysh prompt and command to be echoed prior to
              displaying the results.  This is particularly useful to separate
              the results when executing multiple commands.

       -h, --help
              Display a usage message on standard output and exit.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       VTYSH_PAGER
              This should be the name of the pager to use. Default is more.

FILES
       /usr/local/etc/vtysh.conf
              The default location of the vtysh config file.

       /usr/local/etc/Quagga.conf
              The default location of the integrated Quagga routing engine
              config file if integrated config file is in use (not default).

       ${HOME}/.history_quagga
              Location of history of commands entered via cli
