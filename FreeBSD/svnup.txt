SVNUP                                LOCAL                               SVNUP

NAME
     svnup – A lightweight, dependency-free program to pull source from an
     Apache Subversion server.

SYNOPSIS
     svnup section [-46fntV] [-b branch] [-h hostname/address]
           [-k known files directory] [-l local directory] [-o port]
           [-p protocol] [-r revision] [-v verbosity]

DESCRIPTION
     svnup is a minimalist program used to create or synchronize a local copy
     of a Subversion repository.  It is not intended to be a full-featured
     replacement for the devel/subversion port, but rather, is intended to
     provide a convenient way for users to update FreeBSD source files without
     having to install devel/subversion and all of its related dependencies.

OPTIONS
     Configuration options are stored in /usr/local/etc/svnup.conf and are
     grouped into commonly used sections (additional custom sections can be
     added to this file).  The following command line options can be used to
     override the default and/or section values:

     -4          Use IPv4 addresses only.

     -6          Use IPv6 addresses only.

     -b          The Subversion branch to retrieve.

     -f          Display all files found in the target directory structure
                 that are not present in the repository (each file is
                 displayed with a leading "*").

     -h          The hostname or IP address of the Subversion repository.

     -k          The local directory to save the lists of known files to.

     -l          The local directory to save the repository's files to.

     -n          Display the last known revision number for the specified
                 section and exit.

     -o          The custom port number on the server to connect to.

     -p          The protocol used to connect to the server (currently
                 supported protocols are svn, http and https).

     -r          The revision number to retrieve (defaults to the branch's
                 most recent revision if this option is not specified).

     -t          Remove all files in the local directory tree that do not
                 exist in the repository.  This will result in an exact match
                 of the contents of the remote repository and will remove
                 files in directories like /usr/ports/distfiles,
                 /usr/src/sys/amd64/conf/, etc.  Proceed with caution.

     -v          How verbose the output should be (0 = no output, 1 = show
                 only names of the updated files/folders, 2 = also show a
                 progress indicator, 3 = also show commands sent to the server
                 and show svn response codes -- useful when debugging).

     -V          Display the version number and exit.

FILES
     /usr/local/etc/svnup.conf  Default location of the svnup configuration
                                file.

     /var/tmp/svnup             Default location where svnup stores its lists
                                of known files.  The files stored here are
                                used during subsequent runs to determine which
                                files have been removed from the repository
                                and are safe to delete locally.

DIAGNOSTICS
     Because svnup doesn't use the .svn folder that Subversion's svn client
     uses, you may experience difficulties using svn after using svnup in a
     given directory tree.

EXAMPLES
     Using the configuration options for commonly used branches stored in
     /usr/local/etc/svnup.conf, to retrieve/checkout a copy of the most recent
     revision of the stable/9 branch:

           svnup stable

     To retrieve a copy of the most recent stable/9 branch, but store it in
     /tmp/stable (without modifying /usr/local/etc/svnup.conf)

           svnup stable -l /tmp/stable
