ME(4)                  FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                  ME(4)

NAME
     me – encapsulating network device

SYNOPSIS
     To compile the driver into the kernel, place the following line in the
     kernel configuration file:

           device me

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_me_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The me network interface pseudo device encapsulates datagrams into IP.
     These encapsulated datagrams are routed to a destination host, where they
     are decapsulated and further routed to their final destination.

     me interfaces are dynamically created and destroyed with the ifconfig(8)
     create and destroy subcommands.

     This driver corresponds to RFC 2004.  Datagrams are encapsulated into IP
     with a shorter encapsulation.  The original IP header is modified and the
     modifications are inserted between the so modified header and the
     original payload.  The protocol number 55 is used for outer header.

NOTES
     For correct operation, the me device needs a route to the decapsulating
     host that does not run over the tunnel, as this would be a loop.
