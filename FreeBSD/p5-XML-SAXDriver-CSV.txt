NAME
           XML::SAXDriver::CSV - SAXDriver for converting CSV files to XML

SYNOPSIS
             use XML::SAXDriver::CSV;
             my $driver = XML::SAXDriver::CSV->new(%attr);
             $driver->parse(%attr);

DESCRIPTION
           XML::SAXDriver::CSV was developed as a compliment to XML::CSV, though it provides a SAX
           interface, for gained performance and efficiency, to CSV files.  Specific object attributes
           and handlers are set to define the behavior of the parse() method.  It does not matter where
           you define your attributes.  If they are defined in the new() method, they will apply to all
           parse() calls.  You can override in any call to parse() and it will remain local to that
           function call and not effect the rest of the object.

XML::SAXDriver::CSV properties
           Source - (Reference to a String, ByteStream, SystemId)

               String - Contains literal CSV data. Ex (Source => {String => $foo})

               ByteStream - Contains a filehandle reference.  Ex. (Source => {ByteStream => \*STDIN})

               SystemId - Contains the path to the file containing the CSV data. Ex (Source => {SystemId => '../csv/foo.csv'})

           Handler - Contains the object to be used as a XML print handler

           Declaration

               Version - Specifies an XML version for declaration.  Defaults to '1.0'.

               Encoding - Specifies the endcoding in XML declaration.  Omitted by default.

               Standalone - Specifies the standalone attribute.  Omitted by default.

           DTDHandler - Contains the object to be used as a XML DTD handler.
                        ****There is no DTD support available at this time.
                        I'll make it available in the next version.****

           SubChar - Specifies the character(s) to use to substitute illegal chars in xml tag names, that
                     will be generated from the first row, but setting the Dynamic_Col_Headings.

           Col_Headings - Reference to the array of column names to be used for XML tag names.

           Dynamic_Col_Headings - Should be set if you want the XML tag names generated dynamically
                                  from the first row in CSV file.  **Make sure that the number of columns
                                  in your first row is equal to the largest row in the document.  You
                                  don't generally have to worry about if you are submitting valid CSV
                                  data, where each row will have the same number of columns, even if
                                  they are empty.

           Headings_Handler - Should be used along with Dynamic_Col_Headings to provide a heading
                                normalization handler, to conform the headings to the XML 1.0
                                specifications.  If not provided, a default will be used that only
                                works with ASCII chars, therefore any other character sets need to
                                provide a custom handler!  The handler sub will be passed the heading
                                string as the first argument.
