NAME
       eclat-addr2ec2 - Move VPC IP address back to EC2 Classic

SYNOPSIS
       eclat addr2ec2 IP

       eclat restore-address-to-classic IP

       eclat addr2ec2 --help

DESCRIPTION
       Restores an Elastic IP address that was previously moved to the EC2-VPC
       platform back to the EC2-Classic platform (addresses are moved to
       EC2-VPC using the eclat-addr2vpc(1) command).  You cannot move an
       Elastic IP address that was originally allocated for use in EC2-VPC.
       The Elastic IP address must not be associated with an instance or
       network interface.

       To move the address back to EC2 classic, use eclat addr2ec2.
