FTIME(3)               FreeBSD Library Functions Manual               FTIME(3)

NAME
     ftime – get date and time

LIBRARY
     Compatibility Library (libcompat, -lcompat)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/timeb.h>

     int
     ftime(struct timeb *tp);

DESCRIPTION
     This interface is obsoleted by gettimeofday(2).

     The ftime() routine fills in a structure pointed to by its argument, as
     defined by <sys/timeb.h>:

           /*
            * Structure returned by ftime system call
            */
           struct timeb
           {
                     time_t  time;
                     unsigned short millitm;
                     short   timezone;
                     short   dstflag;
           };

     The structure contains the time since the epoch in seconds, up to 1000
     milliseconds of more-precise interval, The kernel no longer maintains the
     timezone and dstflag info, so 0 is always returned for these fields.

HISTORY
     The ftime function appeared in Version 7 AT&T UNIX.
