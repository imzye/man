NAME
       Devel::Events - Extensible instrumentation framework

VERSION
       version 0.10

SYNOPSIS
               use Devel::Events::Generator::Foo;
               use Devel::Events::Handler::Bar;
               use Devel::Events::Filter::Blort;

               my $h = Devel::Events::Generator->new(
                       handler => Devel::Event::Filter->new(
                               handler => Devel::Events::Handler::Bar->new(),
                       ),
               );

DESCRIPTION
       Devel::Events is an event generation, filtering and analaysis framework
       for instrumenting and auditing perl code.

       The design's purpose is to decouple the mechanics of code
       instrumentation from the analysis, making it easier to write
       debugging/profiling tools.

       Devel::Events::Generator object fire events, which can be mangled by
       Devel::Event::Filter objects. Eventually any number of
       Devel::Event::Handler objects can receive a given event, and perform
       analysis based on it.

       For example Devel::Event::Handler::ObjectTracker can be used to detect
       leaks.

COMPONENT OVERVIEW
       There are two main types of components - generators and handlers.

       Filters are special types of handlers that always delegate to another
       handler.

       The multiplex handler may be used to delegate to any number of
       handlers, and can be the handler for several generators.

       Using these basic components complex chains of handlers can be built to
       properly analyze the events you are interested in.

   Generators
       Devel::Events::Generator::Objects
           Generate "object_bless" and "object_destroy" events by overriding
           "CORE::GLOBAL::bless" and tracking every object using
           Variable::Magic.

       Devel::Events::Generator::SubTrace
           Uses the perl debugger hook to generate "enter_sub" and "leave_sub"
           events.

       Devel::Events::Generator::LineTrace
           Fires an "executing_line" event for every line using the perl
           debugger hook.

       Devel::Events::Generator::Require
           Fires events for "require" and c<use> calls.

   Handlers
       Devel::Events::Handler::Multiplex
           Repeat events to multiple handlers.

       Devel::Events::Handler::Callback
           Make a handler object out of a callback.

       Devel::Events::Handler::Log::Memory
           Log all events to an array.

           Provides filtering and slicing methods to ease analysis.

       Devel::Events::Handler::ObjectTracker
           Handles "object_bless" and "object_destroy" events (as generated by
           Devel::Events::Generator::Objects) to track the lifetime of
           objects. When objects lifetimes extend beyond the scope they're
           supposed to be destroyed in leaks can be detected.}

   Filters
       Devel::Events::Filter::Stamp
           Add various stamp data (time, process ID, thread ID if threads are
           loaded) to events.

       Devel::Events::Filter::Stringify
           Stringify (by default using "StrVal" in overload, to avoid side
           effects) all event data to avoid leaking.

       Devel::Events::Filter::Size
           Add size reports to events using Devel::Size

       Devel::Events::Filter::RemoveFields
           Remove certain fields from events.

       Devel::Events::Filter::Warn
           Runs "warn "@event"" before delegating to the sub handler. Useful
           for debugging handler chains.

EVENT STRUCTURE
       All events are passed as lists.

       The default components will generate lists containing a single string
       which is the event name, and then a list of key/value pairs.
