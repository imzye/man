NAME
       b2g.pl - Traditional to Simplified Chinese converter

SYNOPSIS
       b2g.pl [ -p ] [ -u ] [ inputfile ...] > outputfile

USAGE
           % b2g.pl -p < big5.txt > gbk.txt
           % b2g.pl -pu < trad.txt > simp.txt

DESCRIPTION
       The b2g.pl utility reads files sequentially, converts them from
       Traditional to Simplified Chinese, then writes them to the standard
       output.  The inputfile arguments are processed in command-line order.
       If inputfile is a single dash ("-") or absent, this program reads from
       the standard input.

       The "-p" switch enables rudimentary phrase-oriented substition via a
       small built-in lexicon.

       The "-u" switch specifies that both the input and output streams should
       be UTF-8 encoded.  If not specified, the input stream is assumed to be
       in Big5, and the output will be encoded in GBK.

CAVEATS
       In pure-perl implementations (pre-5.8 perl or without a C compiler),
       "-p" and "-u" cannot be used together.
