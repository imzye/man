RDMA_CREATE_QP(3)        Librdmacm Programmer's Manual       RDMA_CREATE_QP(3)



NAME
       rdma_create_qp - Allocate a QP.

SYNOPSIS
       #include <rdma/rdma_cma.h>

       int rdma_create_qp (struct rdma_cm_id *id, struct ibv_pd *pd, struct
       ibv_qp_init_attr *qp_init_attr);

ARGUMENTS
       id          RDMA identifier.

       pd          Optional protection domain for the QP.

       qp_init_attr
                   Initial QP attributes.

DESCRIPTION
       Allocate a QP associated with the specified rdma_cm_id and transition
       it for sending and receiving.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error.  If an error occurs, errno will
       be set to indicate the failure reason.

NOTES
       The rdma_cm_id must be bound to a local RDMA device before calling this
       function, and the protection domain must be for that same device.  QPs
       allocated to an rdma_cm_id are automatically transitioned by the
       librdmacm through their states.  After being allocated, the QP will be
       ready to handle posting of receives.  If the QP is unconnected, it will
       be ready to post sends.

       If a protection domain is not given - pd parameter is NULL - then the
       rdma_cm_id will be created using a default protection domain.  One
       default protection domain is allocated per RDMA device.

       The initial QP attributes are specified by the qp_init_attr parameter.
       The send_cq and recv_cq fields in the ibv_qp_init_attr are optional.
       If a send or receive completion queue is not specified, then a CQ will
       be allocated by the rdma_cm for the QP, along with corresponding
       completion channels.  Completion channels and CQ data created by the
       rdma_cm are exposed to the user through the rdma_cm_id structure.

       The actual capabilities and properties of the created QP will be
       returned to the user through the qp_init_attr parameter.  An rdma_cm_id
       may only be associated with a single QP.
