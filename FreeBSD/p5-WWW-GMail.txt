NAME
       WWW::GMail - Perl extension for accessing Google Mail (gmail)

SYNOPSIS
         use WWW::GMail;

         my $obj = WWW::GMail->new(
               username => "USERNAME",
               password => "PASSWORD",
               cookies => {
                       autosave => 1,
                       file => "./gmail.cookie",
               },
         );

         my $ret = $obj->login();
         if ($ret == -1) {
               print "password incorrect\n";
         } elsif ($ret == 0) {
               print "unable to login $obj->{error}\n";
               exit;
         }

         my @list = $obj->get_message_list('inbox');

         # count the new messages in the inbox
         my $new_msgs = 0;
         for my $i ( 0 .. $#list ) {
               $new_msgs += $list[$i]->[1]; # count the unread flags
         }

         print "you have $new_msgs new messages in your inbox\n";

         my @contacts = $obj->get_contact_list();

         my $gmail = 0;
         for my $i ( 0 .. $#contacts ) {
               $gmail += ($contacts[$i]->[3] =~ m/gmail\.com$/i);

         print "$gmail of them are gmail addresses\n";

         $obj->logout();

ABSTRACT
       This module simplifies access to gmail.

DESCRIPTION
       Currently this module allows retrieval of message lists, raw messages,
       and the contact list.  All requests to gmail are secured using ssl.

   Methods
       There are currently 5 methods

       "new"
           This will setup the object, useragent and cookie jar.

           The HTTP::Cookies object is stored  as $obj->{jar} The
           LWP::UserAgent object is stored as $obj->{ua}

           The new method accepts a hash of options:

           "username"
               GMail username, stored as $obj->{username}

           "password"
               GMail password, stored as $obj->{password}

           "cookies"
               A hash ref of options passed to HTTP::Cookies Specify {} to
               make the session temporary.

           "agent"
               * Optional!  A useragent string passed to LWP::UserAgent

       "login"
           Logs into GMail, DO THIS FIRST, duh...

           Return values are: 1 login correct 0 some error happend, check
           $obj->{error} for reason -1 incorrect password and/or username

       "get_message_list"
           This method returns an array of arrays Each array has an array ref
           of info about the message Currenly, WWW::GMail doesn't strip the
           html entities, do that yourself for now.  A future version will
           have an option passed to new() to adjust this.

           The array

             0     message id (pass this to get_message_raw)
             1     unread = 1,read = 0
             2     starred = 1,not = 0
             3     date
             4     from
             5     indicator
             6     subj
             7     sent
             8     labels
             9     attachments
             10    message id (again?)
             11    ? unknown
             12    full date

           See the SYNOPSIS

           Also available after calling get_message_list is:

             Used space    $self->{used}
             Total space   $self->{total}
             Percent used  $self->{percent_used}
             Per page      $self->{per_page}
             List total    $self->{list_total}
             List folder   $self->{list_folder}

             Labels        $self->{labels} (an array of arrays)

             The array
                    0      label
                    1      number of new

       "get_message_raw"
           Pass it a message id from a message list (see get_message_list)
           Retrieves the raw message as a scalar, headers and all.  Returns
           undef if there was an error or invalid id Check $obj->{error} for
           messages

       "get_contact_list"
           Returns all contacts in an array of arrayrefs. Contact id is not
           strictly a number.  I have ids such as 11b, be, 1b, d2, 117, 11f

           Each array ref has

             0     Contact id
             1     Name
             2     Name or blank (not sure what this is)
             3     Email
             4     Notes

       "logout"
           Logs out the current logged in account.

EXPORT
       Nothing. Its all Object Orientated.
