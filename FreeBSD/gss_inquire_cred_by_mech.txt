NAME
     gss_inquire_cred_by_mech – Obtain per-mechanism information about a
     credential

SYNOPSIS
     #include <gssapi/gssapi.h>

     OM_uint32
     gss_inquire_cred_by_mech(OM_uint32 *minor_status,
         const gss_cred_id_t cred_handle, const gss_OID mech_type,
         gss_name_t *name, OM_uint32 *initiator_lifetime,
         OM_uint32 *acceptor_lifetime, gss_cred_usage_t *cred_usage);

DESCRIPTION
     Obtains per-mechanism information about a credential.

PARAMETERS
     minor_status            Mechanism specific status code.

     cred_handle             A handle that refers to the target credential.
                             Specify GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL to inquire about the
                             default initiator principal.

     mech_type               The mechanism for which information should be
                             returned.

     name                    The name whose identity the credential asserts.
                             Storage associated with this name must be freed
                             by the application after use with a call to
                             gss_release_name().  Specify NULL if not
                             required.

     initiator_lifetime      The number of seconds for which the credential
                             will remain capable of initiating security
                             contexts under the specified mechanism.  If the
                             credential can no longer be used to initiate
                             contexts, or if the credential usage for this
                             mechanism is GSS_C_ACCEPT, this parameter will be
                             set to zero.  If the implementation does not
                             support expiration of initiator credentials, the
                             value GSS_C_INDEFINITE will be returned.  Specify
                             NULL if not required.

     acceptor_lifetime       The number of seconds for which the credential
                             will remain capable of accepting security
                             contexts under the specified mechanism.  If the
                             credential can no longer be used to accept
                             contexts, or if the credential usage for this
                             mechanism is GSS_C_INITIATE, this parameter will
                             be set to zero.  If the implementation does not
                             support expiration of acceptor credentials, the
                             value GSS_C_INDEFINITE will be returned.  Specify
                             NULL if not required.

     cred_usage              How the credential may be used with the specified
                             mechanism.  One of the following:
                                   GSS_C_INITIATE
                                   GSS_C_ACCEPT
                                   GSS_C_BOTH
                             Specify NULL if not required.

RETURN VALUES
     GSS_S_COMPLETE                  Successful completion

     GSS_S_NO_CRED                   The referenced credentials could not be
                                     accessed

     GSS_S_DEFECTIVE_CREDENTIAL      The referenced credentials were invalid

     GSS_S_CREDENTIALS_EXPIRED       The referenced credentials have expired.
                                     If the lifetime parameter was not passed
                                     as NULL, it will be set to 0.
