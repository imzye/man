           if ( $check->match( $conn ) ){
               print "It matched!\n";
           }

METHODS
   new
       This initializes a new check object.

       It takes one value and thht is a hash ref with the key checks.  This is
       a array of hashes. If the array is empty, it will default to using the
       All test.

       If new fails, it will die.

       checks hash keys

       type

       This is the name of the check relative to 'Net::Connection::Match::'.

       So 'Net::Connection::Match::PTR' would become 'PTR'.

       args

       This is a hash or args to pash to the check. These are passed to the
       new method of the check module.

       invert

       This is either boolean on if the check should be inverted or not.

           my $mce;
           eval{
               $ncm=Net::Connection::Match->new( $args );
           };

   match
       Checks if a single Net::Connection object matches the stack.

       One object is argument is taken and that is the Net::Connection to
       check.

       The return value is a boolean.

           if ( $ncm->match( $conn ) ){
               print "It matched.\n";
           }

ERROR HANDLING / FLAGS
       Error handling is provided by Error::Helper.

   2 / notNCobj
       Not a Net::Connection object. Either is is not defined or what is being
       passed is not a Net::Connection object.
