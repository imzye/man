NAME
       MRO::Define - Define your own method resolution order

SYNOPSIS
           # define your mro
           use mro;
           use MRO::Define;
           MRO::Define::register_mro(your_mro => sub { ... });

           # use your mro somewhere else
           use mro 'your_mro';

DESCRIPTION
       With recent versions of perl it is possible to change the method
       resolution order (mro) of a given class either by using "use mro" as
       shown in the synopsis, or by using the "mro::set_mro".

       Perl itself comes with two MROs by default. The traditional Perl
       default MRO (depth first search, DFS) and C3 MRO.

       This module allows you to define custom method resolution orders in
       addition to those perl already has.

FUNCTIONS
   register_mro ($name, $resolve_callback)
       This function allows registering of custom method resolution orders.
       Your MRO needs to have a $name as well as a $resolve_callback that will
       get invoked when a method trying to be resolved using your MRO. The
       resolve callback is expected to return an array reference of package
       names that will be used for the method lookup.
