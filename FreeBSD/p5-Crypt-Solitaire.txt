NAME
       Crypt::Solitaire - Solitaire encryption

SYNOPSIS
       # OO Interface
         use Crypt::Solitaire;
         $ref = Crypt::Solitaire->new( $passphrase );
         $encrypted = $ref->encrypt( $text );

         $ref2 = Crypt::Solitaire->new( $passphrase );
         $decrypted = $ref2->decrypt( $encrypted );

       # Functional Interface

         use Crypt::Solitaire;
         my $encrypted = Pontifex( $plaintext, $passphrase, $mode );

DESCRIPTION
       Solitaire is a top-notch pencil-and-paper encryption system developed
       by Bruce Schneier.  Here is the description in Schneier's own words:

       "In Neal Stephenson's novel Cryptonomicon, the character Enoch Root
       describes a cryptosystem code-named "Pontifex" to another character
       named Randy Waterhouse, and later reveals that the steps of the
       algorithm are intended to be carried out using a deck of playing cards.
       These two characters go on to exchange several encrypted messages using
       this system. The system is called "Solitaire" (in the novel, "Pontifex"
       is a code name intended to temporarily conceal the fact that it employs
       a deck of cards) and I designed it to allow field agents to communicate
       securely without having to rely on electronics or having to carry
       incriminating tools. An agent might be in a situation where he just
       does not have access to a computer, or may be prosecuted if he has
       tools for secret communication. But a deck of cards...what harm is
       that?

       "Solitaire gets its security from the inherent randomness in a shuffled
       deck of cards. By manipulating this deck, a communicant can create a
       string of "random" letters that he then combines with his message. Of
       course Solitaire can be simulated on a computer, but it is designed to
       be implemented by hand.

       "Solitaire may be low-tech, but its security is intended to be high-
       tech. I designed Solitaire to be secure even against the most well-
       funded military adversaries with the biggest computers and the smartest
       cryptanalysts. Of course, there is no guarantee that someone won't find
       a clever attack against Solitaire, but the algorithm is certainly
       better than any other pencil-and-paper cipher I've ever seen."

       Simple system, easy to use, and relatively fast.

LIMITATIONS
       Restricted only to letters A..Z. Lower case letters are converted to
       upper case, and due to the fact that Solitaire applies its own
       formatting to the text, the output can be a little tricky at first
       glance.

       It also should be noted that there is a verified bias in the algorithm.

METHODS
       Pontifex $text, $passphrase, $mode
           $text is encrypted using $passphrase.  Encrypts or decrypts, based
           on $mode.  Mode must be set to "e" or "d," for encrypting and
           decrypting, respectively.
