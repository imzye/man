Mixin::Linewise(3)    User Contributed Perl Documentation   Mixin::Linewise(3)


NAME
       Mixin::Linewise - write your linewise code for handles; this does the
       rest

VERSION
       version 0.111

DESCRIPTION
       It's boring to deal with opening files for IO, converting strings to
       handle-like objects, and all that.  With Mixin::Linewise::Readers and
       Mixin::Linewise::Writers, you can just write a method to handle
       handles, and methods for handling strings and filenames are added for
       you.

PERL VERSION
       This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates
       from the Perl 5 Porters.  This means it should work on any version of
       perl released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the most
       recently released version is v5.40, then this module should work on
       both v5.40 and v5.38.)

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made
       that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version
       may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.
