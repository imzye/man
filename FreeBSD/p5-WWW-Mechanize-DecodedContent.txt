WWW::Mechanize::DecodedContent(3)          User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       WWW::Mechanize::DecodedContent - decode Mech content using its HTTP
       response encoding

SYNOPSIS
         use WWW::Mechanize;
         use WWW::Mechanize::DecodedContent;

         my $mech = WWW::Mechanize->new;
            $mech->get($url);

         my $content = $mech->decoded_content || $mech->content;

DESCRIPTION
       WWW::Mechanize::DecodedContent is a plugin to add decoded_content
       utility method to WWW::Mechanize.

       NOTE If you're using WWW::Mechanize 1.50 or later, just use
       "$mech->content" and it will return decoded content.

METHODS
       res->encoding
           Because it loads HTTP::Response::Encoding module, it automatically
           adds encoding method to HTTP::Response class.

             my $enc = $mech->res->encoding;

           Note that $enc might be empty if HTTP response header doesn't
           contain valid charset attribute.

       decoded_content
             my $content = $mech->decoded_content;

           returns HTML as decoded using HTTP response encoding. Returns undef
           if encoding is not specified. In that case you might need to get
           the raw content using "$mech->content", and decode it using the
           default encoding, which is likely to be iso-8859-1.
