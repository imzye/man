NAME
       bigyear - print a calendar, one month per page

SYNOPSIS
       bigyear [month] [year]

DESCRIPTION
       The command bigyear will print a calendar to standard out.  If no
       arguments are given bigyear will print the current month.  Providing
       bigyear with just a year will cause bigyear to print all twelve months
       of the specified year.  A month may be specified (as a number 1 to 12),
       with a year or without a year.  If a month is specified but no year,
       bigyear will print that month for the current year.
