KVM_KERNDISP(3)        FreeBSD Library Functions Manual        KVM_KERNDISP(3)

NAME
     kvm_kerndisp – get kernel displacement

LIBRARY
     Kernel Data Access Library (libkvm, -lkvm)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <kvm.h>

     kssize_t
     kvm_kerndisp(kvm_t *kd);

DESCRIPTION
     kvm_kerndisp() returns the number of bytes by which the kernel referenced
     by kd is displaced.  This is the difference between the kernel's base
     virtual address at run time and the kernel base virtual address specified
     in the kernel image file.

     Note that if the kernel is moved to a lower memory address, the
     displacement will be negative.

RETURN VALUES
     kvm_kerndisp() returns the number of bytes by which the kernel is
     displaced.  If the kernel is not displaced or if it is not possible to
     find the displacement then 0 is returned.
