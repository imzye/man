NAME
       Plack::Middleware::Headers - modify HTTP response headers

VERSION
       version 0.11

SYNOPSIS
         use Plack::Builder;

         builder {
             enable 'Headers',
               set    => ['X-Plack-One' => '1'],
               append => ['X-Plack-Two' => '2'],
               unset  => ['X-Plack-Three'];
             enable 'Headers',
               code   => '404',
               set    => ['X-Robots-Tag' => 'noindex, noarchive, follow'];
             enable 'Headers',
               when   => ['Content-Type' => qr{^text/}],
               set    => ['Content-Type' => 'text/plain'];

             sub {['200', [], ['hello']]};
         };

DESCRIPTION
       This Plack::Middleware simplifies creation ("set" or "append"),
       deletion ("unset"), and modification ("set") of PSGI response headers.
       The modification can be enabled based on response code ("code") or
       existing response headers("when"). Use Plack::Middleware::Conditional
       to enable the middleware based in request headers.

CONFIGURATION
       set Overwrites existent header(s).

       unset
           Remove existing header(s).

       append
           Add header(s).

       code
           Optional HTTP response code that modification of response headers
           is limited to.

       when
           Optional check on the response headers that must be true to
           actually modify headers. Either one provides a list of headers for
           which one of them must match. Matching can be tested against:

               header => undef,    # missing header
               header => $scalar   # exact value
               header => /$regexp/ # regular expression

           Alternatively one can check with a code reference that all response
           headers are passed to as list.
