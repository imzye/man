LYX(1)                             LyX 2.4.3                            LYX(1)

NAME
       LyX - A Document Processor

SYNOPSIS
       lyx [ command-line switches ] [ name[.lyx] ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       LyX is too complex to be described completely in the "man" page format.
       If your system is properly configured, you can access the full
       documentation within LyX under the Help menu.

       LyX is a document preparation system. It excels at letting you create
       complex technical and scientific articles with mathematics,
       cross-references, bibliographies, indices, etc. It is very good at
       documents of any length in which the usual processing abilities are
       required: automatic sectioning and pagination, spellchecking, and so
       forth. It can also be used to write a letter to your mom, though
       granted, there are probably simpler programs available for that. It is
       definitely not the best tool for creating banners, flyers, or
       advertisements, though with some effort all these can be done, too.
       Some examples of what it is used for: memos, letters, dissertations and
       theses, lecture notes, seminar notebooks, conference proceedings,
       software documentation, books (on PostgreSQL, remote sensing,
       cryptology, fictional novels, poetry, and even a children's book or
       two), articles in refereed scientific journals, scripts for plays and
       movies, business proposals... you get the idea.

       Currently, LyX uses the Qt library as a toolkit. LyX should run
       everywhere, where this library runs.  This is on all major Unix
       platforms as well as Windows and macOS (which actually is a unix
       platform).

OPTIONS
       LyX supports the following command-line switches.

       -help summarizes LyX usage

       -version
             provides version information on the build of LyX.

       -sysdir directory
             sets system directory. Normally not needed.

       -userdir directory
             sets user directory. Needed if you want to use LyX with different
             lyxrc settings.

       -geometry WxH+X+Y
             set geometry of the main window.

       -dbg feature[,feature...]
             where feature is a name or number.  Use "lyx -dbg" to see the
             list of available debug features.

        -x [--execute] command
             where command is a lyx command.

        -e [--export] fmt
             where fmt is the export format of choice (latex, pdflatex,
             luatex, xetex, xhtml, text, lyx, ps, pdf, ...).  Note that the
             order of -e and -x switches matters.

        -E [--export-to] fmt filename
             where fmt is the export format of choice (see --export), and
             filename is the destination filename. Note that any additional
             external file needed by filename (such as image files) will be
             exported as well to the folder containing filename (preserving
             the relative path embedded within the original LyX document, if
             any).

        -i [--import] fmt file.xxx
             where fmt is the import format of choice and file.xxx is the file
             to be imported.

        -f [--force-overwrite] what
             where what is is either "all", "main" or "none".  Specify "all"
             to allow overwriting all files during a batch export, "main" to
             allow overwriting the main file only, or "none" to disallow
             overwriting any file. When this switch is followed by anything
             else other than "all", "main" or "none", the behavior is as if
             "all" was specified, but what follows is left on the command line
             for further processing.

        --ignore-error-message which
             allows you to ignore specific LaTeX error messages.  Do not use
             for final documents! Currently supported values: "missing_glyphs"
             Fontspec "missing glyphs" error.

        -n [--no-remote]
             open documents passed as arguments in a new instance, even if
             another instance of LyX is already running.

        -r [--remote]
             by using the lyxpipe, ask an already running instance of LyX to
             open the documents passed as arguments and then exit. If the
             lyxpipe is not set up or is not working, a new instance is
             created and execution continues normally.

        -v [--verbose]
             print on terminal all spawned external commands.

       -batch
             causes LyX to run the given commands without opening a GUI
             window.  Thus, something like:
                 lyx -batch -x "buffer-print printer default dvips" myfile.lyx
             will cause LyX to print myfile.lyx to the default printer, using
             dvips and the default print settings (which, of course, have to
             have been configured already).


QT OPTIONS
       LyX is a Qt-based application and thus recognizes common options
       implemented by Qt itself (notably -platform, -style, -geometry,
       -session, -display, etc). Please consult Qt documentation for further
       details, e.g.:

       https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qapplication.html#QApplication
       https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qguiapplication.html#supported-command-line-
       options


ENVIRONMENT
       LYX_DIR_24x
              can be used to specify which system directory to use.

       The system directory is determined by searching for the file
       "chkconfig.ltx". Directories are searched in this order:
       1) -sysdir command line parameter
       2) LYX_DIR_24x environment variable
       3) Maybe <path of binary>/TOP_SRCDIR/lib
       4) <path of binary>/../share/<name of binary>/
       5) hardcoded lyx_dir (at build time: /usr/local/share/lyx)

       LYX_USERDIR_24x
              can be used to specify which user directory to use.

       The user directory is, in order of precedence:
       1) -userdir command line parameter
       2) LYX_USERDIR_24x environment variable
       3) $HOME/.<name of binary> if no explicit setting is made


       LYX_LOCALEDIR
              can be used to tell LyX where to look for the translations of
              its GUI strings in other languages.


       LYX_FORCE_OVERWRITE
              can be used to change the default behavior when exporting from
              command line.

       By default, LyX overwrites the main file when exporting from command
       line but not the ancillary files. This behavior can be changed by
       setting this environment variable, which relieves the need of using the
       -f switch.  Allowed values are either "all", "main" or "none", with
       same meaning as for the -f switch.

       ~/.lyx/preferences      Personal configuration file
       ~/.lyx/lyxrc.defaults   Personal autodetected configuration file

BUGS/LIMITATIONS
       There are still some bugs in LyX. To report one, read if possible the
       Introduction found under the Help menu in LyX. You'll find detailed
       info on submitting bug reports there. If you can't do that, send
       details to the LyX Developers mailing list lyx-devel@lists.lyx.org, or
       use the LyX bug tracker at http://www.lyx.org/trac/wiki/BugTrackerHome.
       Don't forget to mention which version you are having problems with!

       LaTeX import is still not perfect and may produce buggy *.lyx files.
       Consult the tex2lyx documentation.
