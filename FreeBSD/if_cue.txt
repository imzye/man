NAME
     cue – CATC USB-EL1210A USB Ethernet driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device uhci
           device ohci
           device usb
           device miibus
           device uether
           device cue

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_cue_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The cue driver provides support for USB Ethernet adapters based on the
     Computer Access Technology Corporation's USB-EL1210A chipset.

     The USB-EL1210A supports a 512-bit multicast hash filter, single perfect
     filter entry for the station address and promiscuous mode.  Packets are
     received and transmitted over separate USB bulk transfer endpoints.

     The CATC chipset supports only 10Mbps half-duplex mode, hence there are
     no ifmedia() modes to select.

     For more information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

HARDWARE
     The cue driver supports CATC USB-EL1210A based USB Ethernet adapters
     including:

     •   Belkin F5U011/F5U111
     •   CATC Netmate
     •   CATC Netmate II
     •   SmartBridges SmartLink

DIAGNOSTICS
     cue%d: watchdog timeout  A packet was queued for transmission and a
     transmit command was issued, however the device failed to acknowledge the
     transmission before a timeout expired.

     cue%d: no memory for rx list  The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for
     the receiver ring.

HISTORY
     The cue device driver first appeared in FreeBSD 4.0.
