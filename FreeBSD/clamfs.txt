NAME
       clamfs - an anti-virus protected file system

SYNOPSIS
       clamfs <configuration.file>

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the ClamFS user-space file system.

       clamfs is a program that mount anti-virus protected file system into
       existing directory tree.

   Features
       * User-space file system (no kernel patches, recompilation, etc.)

       * Configuration stored in XML files

       * FUSE (and libfuse) used as file system back-end

       * Scan files using ClamAV

       * ScanCache (LRU with time-based and out-of-memory expiration) speeds
              up file access

       * Sends mail to administrator when detect virus

   Idea
       ClamFS is completely user-space anti-virus solution for Linux.  It uses
       libfuse and Linux kernel module to provide file system.  ClamAV is used
       as anti-virus scanner.

       Normally program (or library) uses glibc open() call to obtain file
       descriptor.  Glibc calls kernel VFS to open file regardless of file
       system used.  If file is on ClamFS file system open call from VFS is
       directed to user-space by FUSE.  ClamFS calls libfuse to communicate
       with FUSE and through it with VFS.

   Internals
       ClamFS is split into four parts:

       * libfuse bindings -- used to communicate with FUSE (and with VFS
              through it),

       * ScanCache -- store (per file) results of anti-virus scanning to speed
              up future open() requests

       * ScanQueue -- queue files for scanning

       * clamd / libclamav bindings -- communicate with anti-virus scanner



OPTIONS
       This program uses only one command line argument - configuration file
       name.
