NG_GIF_DEMUX(4)        FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual        NG_GIF_DEMUX(4)

NAME
     ng_gif_demux – demultiplexer for packets from ng_gif(4) nodes

SYNOPSIS
     #include <netgraph/ng_gif_demux.h>

DESCRIPTION
     The ng_gif_demux netgraph node type demultiplexes the output from
     ng_gif(4) nodes in the netgraph(4) networking subsystem.

     The gif hook is meant to be connected to the lower or orphans hook of an
     ng_gif(4) node.  The inet, inet6, atalk, ipx, atm, natm, and ns hooks
     output frames of the given type when they are received on the gif hook.
     When a frame is received on one of these hooks, it is encapsulated and
     sent out the gif hook.

     This node type supports the following hooks:

     gif        Connection to the lower or orphans hook of an ng_gif(4) node.

     inet       Hook for input and output of IP frames.

     inet6      Hook for input and output of IPv6 frames.

     atalk      Hook for input and output of AppleTalk frames.

     ipx        Hook for input and output of IPX frames.

     atm        Hook for input and output of ATM frames.

     natm       Hook for input and output of NATM frames.
