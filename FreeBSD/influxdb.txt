NAME
       influx - InfluxDB client

SYNOPSIS
       influx [options]
       influx -execute <command> [options]
       influx -import -path <path> (-compressed) [options]
       influx -version

DESCRIPTION
       influx is the command line program for interacting with an InfluxDB
       server.

       In the first form, the program starts a CLI that can be used to write
       data or query the database. The command line is described in COMMAND
       LINE.

       In the second form, this will execute a single command, usually a
       query. This is the equivalent of starting the command line, running one
       command, and then exiting.

       In the third form, this imports a previously exported database to the
       database.

       The fourth form outputs the version of the command line and then
       immediately exits.
