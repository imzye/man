PMAP_UNWIRE(9)         FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual        PMAP_UNWIRE(9)

NAME
     pmap_unwire – unwire a range of virtual pages

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <vm/vm.h>
     #include <vm/pmap.h>

     void
     pmap_unwire(pmap_t pmap, vm_offset_t start, vm_offset_t end);

DESCRIPTION
     The function pmap_unwire() removes the wired attribute from each of the
     virtual-to-physical page mappings within the virtual address range from
     start to end of the physical map pmap.  Every valid mapping within that
     range is required to have the wired attribute set.  Invalid mappings are
     ignored, since they cannot have the wired attribute set.

NOTES
     Only the function pmap_enter(9) can be used to set the wired attribute of
     a virtual-to-physical page mapping.
