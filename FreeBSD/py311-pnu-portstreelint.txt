NAME
     portstreelint – FreeBSD ports tree lint

SYNOPSIS
     portstreelint [--nocfg|-n] [--gencfg|-g FILE] [--show-cat|-C]
                   [--show-mnt|-M] [--cat|-c LIST] [--mnt|-m LIST]
                   [--port|-p LIST] [--tree|-t DIR] [--plist NUM]
                   [--broken NUM] [--deprecated NUM] [--forbidden NUM]
                   [--unchanged NUM] [--check-host|-h] [--check-url|-u]
                   [--output|-o FILE] [--debug] [--info] [--version]
                   [--help|-?] [--]

                   The aliases ptlint and ptl are also available to shorten
                   the command name.

DESCRIPTION
     The portstreelint utility checks the FreeBSD ports tree Index and some
     parts of the ports' Makefiles for errors and warnings.

     By default it will scan the whole port tree, but you can select a subset
     of the ports with the options [--cat|-c] for categories, [--mnt|-m] for
     maintainers and [--port|-p] for ports.  All these options expect a
     parameter which can be a single item or a comma-separated list of items.
     If you combine several of these operators they will perform as a logical
     AND.

     The [--mnt|-m] option defaults to @FreeBSD.org for unspecified domains.

     In order to know which categories or maintainers are available for
     selection, you can use the [--show-cat|-C] and [--show-mnt|-M] options to
     view all the categories and maintainers with their number of associated
     ports.

     The two costlier analysis are disabled by default.  You can check if the
     port's www sites hostnames are resolvable with the [--check-host|-h]
     option (takes about 15 minutes on the whole port tree).  And you can
     check if the port's www sites URL are available with the [--check-url|-u]
     option, which implies the previous one (takes about 6 hours on the whole
     port tree).

     The checks list includes:

     •   Nonexistent Makefile

     •   Nonexistent INDEX:port-path

     •   Unusual INDEX:installation-prefix (warning)

     •   Too long INDEX:comments (> 70 characters) (warning)

     •   Uncapitalized INDEX:comments

     •   INDEX:comments ending with a dot

     •   INDEX:comments different from Makefile:COMMENT

     •   Nonexistent INDEX:description-file

     •   URL ending INDEX:description-file

     •   INDEX:description-file content same as INDEX:comment

     •   INDEX:description-file content no longer than INDEX:comment

     •   Nonexistent pkg-plist, Makefile:PLIST_FILES/PLIST/PLIST_SUB (debug)

     •   Makefile:PLIST_FILES abuse (warning)

     •   INDEX:maintainer different from Makefile:MAINTAINER

     •   Unofficial categories (warning)

     •   INDEX:categories different from Makefile:CATEGORIES

     •   Empty INDEX:www-site

     •   Unresolvable INDEX:www-site (optional)

     •   Unaccessible INDEX:www-site (optional)

     •   INDEX:www-site different from Makefile:WWW

     •   Ports marked as BROKEN, DEPRECATED, FORBIDDEN, IGNORE, RESTRICTED
         (info)

     •   Ports marked with an EXPIRATION_DATE (warning)

     •   Ports marked as BROKEN, FORBIDDEN or DEPRECATED for too long
         (warning)

     •   Ports unchanged for a long time (info)

     •   Makefile:PORTVERSION and Makefile:DISTVERSION used simultaneously

     •   VuXML vulnerabilities for the current port versions (warning)

     It's possible to change the default values for PLIST_FILES abuse,
     BROKEN_since, DEPRECATED_since, FORBIDDEN_since and Unchanged_since with
     the [--plist], [--broken], [--deprecated], [--forbidden] and
     [--unchanged] options, followed by a number of files for the first one
     and a number of days for the others.  And you can select a port tree in a
     location other than /usr/ports with the [--tree|-t] option.

     Finally, there's a [--output|-o] option to generate a CSV delimited file
     with the per-maintainer findings to a specified filename. This allows for
     automated processing of the results, such as, for example, sending
     warning emails, storing results and displaying only diffs since previous
     run...

     For convenience, you can put your favourite options in a configuration
     file, which will be read before processing the environment and the
     command line, unless you use the [--nocfg|-n] option. You can generate a
     default configuration file with the [--gencfg|-g] option followed by a
     filename. This file also offers full control over the checks to perform,
     and a way to discard false-positive vulnerabilities.

   OPTIONS
     [--nocfg|-n] Don't use the configuration file

     [--gencfg|-g FILE] Generate a default configuration file in FILE

     [--show-cat|-C] Show categories with ports count

     [--show-mnt|-M] Show maintainers with ports count

     [--cat|-c LIST] Select only the comma-separated categories in LIST

     [--mnt|-m LIST] Select only the comma-separated maintainers in LIST

     [--port|-p LIST] Select only the comma-separated ports in LIST

     [--tree|-t DIR] Ports directory (default=/usr/ports)

     [--plist NUM] Set PLIST_FILES abuse to NUM files

     [--broken NUM] Set BROKEN since to NUM days

     [--deprecated NUM] Set DEPRECATED since to NUM days

     [--forbidden NUM] Set FORBIDDEN since to NUM days

     [--unchanged NUM] Set Unchanged since to NUM days

     [--check-host|-h] Enable checking hostname resolution (long!)

     [--check-url|-u] Enable checking URL (very long!)

     [--output|-o] Enable per-maintainer CSV output to FILE

     [--debug] Enable logging at debug level

     [--info] Enable logging at info level

     [--version] Print version and exit

     [--help|-?] Print usage and this help message and exit

     [--] Options processing terminator

ENVIRONMENT
     The PTLINT_DEBUG environment variable can be set to any value to enable
     debug mode.

     If the system's PORTSDIR environment variable is set, it'll be used
     instead of the default /usr/ports.  But the [--tree|-t DIR] option will
     still override it.

FILES
     The whole port tree under /usr/ports, or the location indicated by the
     PORTSDIR environment variable, or the [--tree|-t] argument:

     •   as root, if you have installed portsnap, update to the last version
         with "portsnap fetch update"

     •   or, if you have installed git, clone the latest repository with "git
         clone https://git.FreeBSD.org/ports.git /usr/ports"

     /usr/ports/INDEX-xx : where xx is the major version of FreeBSD that you
     are using (as I write this xx=14).

     •   as root, get the last version with "cd /usr/ports ; make fetchindex"

     •   or rebuild it from your port tree with "cd /usr/ports ; make index"

     ${HOME}/.ptlint : an INI-style configuration file.

     •   Generate a default one with the [--gencfg|-g] option and tweak it to
         your taste.

EXIT STATUS
     The portstreelint utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     To analyze the full port tree (takes a long time!), do:

     $ nohup portstreelint --info -hu > stdout.txt 2> stderr.txt &

     To analyze the full port tree in the background and generate a CSV file,
     do:

     $ nohup portstreelint -huo csv_results.txt > /dev/null 2>&1 &

     To analyze the ports of a specific maintainer identified by id@domain,
     do:

     $ portstreelint --info -m id@domain

STANDARDS
     The portstreelint utility is not a standard UNIX command.

     This implementation tries to follow the PEP 8 style guide for Python
     code.

PORTABILITY
     None. Works only on FreeBSD, but who needs anything else?

     Packaged for FreeBSD as pyXX-pnu-portstreelint.

HISTORY
     While working on the 4th version of the pysec2vuxml tool, I noticed there
     were errors in the FreeBSD port Index, so I built the portlint2 tool to
     analyze this more thoroughly...

     After discussions on the freebsd-ports mailing list an interest in
     checking port vulnerabilities arose, which led me to convert that
     standalone command into a Python package in order to benefit from my
     vuxml library.

LICENSE
     It is available under the 3-clause BSD license.

CAVEATS
     The IGNORE mark check is not reliable because this tool doesn't parse the
     ports' Makefiles, but just loads their variables without regard to the
     conditional tests that may surround them.

     The nonexistent plist is not very helpful because there are unaccounted
     autoplist options for some languages (Python)...

     The ports using exotic versioning schemes will be skipped from the
     vulnerability check because the library we use for version comparisons is
     geared toward Python ports and limited for this usage.
