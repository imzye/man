NAME
       getmail - retrieve messages from one or more POP3, IMAP4, or SDPS
       mailboxes and deliver to a maildir, mboxrd-format mbox file, or
       external MDA

SYNOPSIS
       getmail [OPTION] ...

DESCRIPTION
       getmail can retrieve messages from POP3, IMAP4, and SDPS mailboxes.
       SSL-wrapped POP3 and IMAP are also supported.  Single-user and domain
       (multi-drop) mailboxes are supported.

       getmail has built-in support for delivering to maildirs, mboxrd-format
       mbox files, and external MDAs.

OPTIONS
       --version
              show program's version number and exit

       -h, --help
              show a short usage summary and exit

       -gDIR, --getmaildir=DIR
              look in DIR for config/data files

       -rFILE, --rcfile=FILE
              load configuration from FILE (may be given multiple times)

       --dump dump configuration and exit (debugging)

       --trace
              print extended trace information (extremely verbose)

       -iFOLDER, --idle=FOLDER
              maintain connection and listen for new messages in FOLDER.  This
