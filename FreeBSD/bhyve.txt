SYNOPSIS
     bhyve [-AabCeHhPSuWwxY]
           [-c [[cpus=]numcpus][,sockets=n][,cores=n][,threads=n]] [-G port]
           [-g gdbport] [-l help|lpcdev[,conf]] [-m memsize[K|k|M|m|G|g|T|t]]

DESCRIPTION
     bhyve is a hypervisor that runs guest operating systems inside a virtual
     machine.

     Parameters such as the number of virtual CPUs, amount of guest memory,
     and I/O connectivity can be specified with command-line parameters.

     If not using a boot ROM, the guest operating system must be loaded with
     bhyveload(8) or a similar boot loader before running bhyve, otherwise, it
     is enough to run bhyve with a boot ROM of choice.

     bhyve runs until the guest operating system reboots or an unhandled
     hypervisor exit is detected.

OPTIONS
     -a          The guest's local APIC is configured in xAPIC mode.  The
                 xAPIC mode is the default setting so this option is
                 redundant.  It will be deprecated in a future version.

     -A          Generate ACPI tables.  Required for FreeBSD/amd64 guests.

     -b          Enable a low-level console device supported by FreeBSD
                 kernels compiled with device bvmconsole.  This option will be
                 deprecated in a future version.

     -c [setting ...]
                 Number of guest virtual CPUs and/or the CPU topology.  The
                 default value for each of numcpus, sockets, cores, and
                 threads is 1.  The current maximum number of guest virtual
                 CPUs is 16.  If numcpus is not specified then it will be
                 calculated from the other arguments.  The topology must be
                 consistent in that the numcpus must equal the product of
                 sockets, cores, and threads.  If a setting is specified more
                 than once the last one has precedence.

     -C          Include guest memory in core file.

     -D          Destroy the VM on guest initiated power-off.

     -e          Force bhyve to exit when a guest issues an access to an I/O
                 port that is not emulated.  This is intended for debug
                 purposes.

     -g gdbport  For FreeBSD kernels compiled with device bvmdebug, allow a
                 remote kernel kgdb to be relayed to the guest kernel gdb stub
                 via a local IPv4 address and this port.  This option will be
                 deprecated in a future version.

     -G port     Start a debug server that uses the GDB protocol to export
                 guest state to a debugger.  An IPv4 TCP socket will be bound
                 to the supplied port to listen for debugger connections.
                 Only a single debugger may be attached to the debug server at
                 a time.  If port begins with ‘w’, bhyve will pause execution
                 at the first instruction waiting for a debugger to attach.

     -h          Print help message and exit.

     -H          Yield the virtual CPU thread when a HLT instruction is
                 detected.  If this option is not specified, virtual CPUs will
                 use 100% of a host CPU.

     -l [help|lpcdev[,conf]]
                 Allow devices behind the LPC PCI-ISA bridge to be configured.
                 The only supported devices are the TTY-class devices com1 and
                 com2 and the boot ROM device bootrom.

                 help print a list of supported LPC devices.

     -m memsize[K|k|M|m|G|g|T|t]
                 Guest physical memory size in bytes.  This must be the same
                 size that was given to bhyveload(8).

                 The size argument may be suffixed with one of K, M, G or T
                 (either upper or lower case) to indicate a multiple of
                 kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, or terabytes.  If no suffix
                 is given, the value is assumed to be in megabytes.

                 memsize defaults to 256M.

     -p vcpu:hostcpu
                 Pin guest's virtual CPU vcpu to hostcpu.

     -P          Force the guest virtual CPU to exit when a PAUSE instruction
                 is detected.

     -s [help|slot,emulation[,conf]]
                 Configure a virtual PCI slot and function.

                 bhyve provides PCI bus emulation and virtual devices that can
                 be attached to slots on the bus.  There are 32 available
                 slots, with the option of providing up to 8 functions per
                 slot.

                 help        print a list of supported PCI devices.

                 slot        pcislot[:function] bus:pcislot:function

                             The pcislot value is 0 to 31.  The optional
                             function value is 0 to 7.  The optional bus value
                             is 0 to 255.  If not specified, the function
                             value defaults to 0.  If not specified, the bus
                             value defaults to 0.

                 emulation

                             hostbridge | amd_hostbridge

                                         Provide a simple host bridge.  This
                                         is usually configured at slot 0, and
                                         is required by most guest operating
                                         systems.  The amd_hostbridge
                                         emulation is identical but uses a PCI
                                         vendor ID of AMD.

                 [conf]      This optional parameter describes the backend for
                             device emulations.  If conf is not specified, the
                             device emulation has no backend and can be
                             considered unconnected.

                             Network devices:

                             tapN[,mac=xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx]

                             vmnetN[,mac=xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx]

                                         If mac is not specified, the MAC
                                         address is derived from a fixed OUI
                                         and the remaining bytes from an MD5
                                         hash of the slot and function numbers
                                         and the device name.

                                         The MAC address is an ASCII string in
                                         ethers(5) format.

                             Block storage devices:

                             The block-device-options are:

                             nocache   Open the file with O_DIRECT.

                             direct    Open the file using O_SYNC.

                             ro        Force the file to be opened read-only.

                             sectorsize=logical[/physical]
                                       Specify the logical and physical sector
                                       sizes of the emulated disk.  The
                                       physical sector size is optional and is
                                       equal to the logical sector size if not
                                       explicitly specified.

                             SCSI devices:

                             /dev/cam/ctl[pp.vp][,scsi-device-options]

                             The scsi-device-options are:

                             iid=IID     Initiator ID to use when sending
                                         requests to specified CTL port.  The
                                         default value is 0.

                             TTY devices:

                             stdio       Connect the serial port to the
                                         standard input and output of the
                                         bhyve process.

                             /dev/xxx    Use the host TTY device for serial
                                         port I/O.

                             Boot ROM device:

                             romfile     Map romfile in the guest address
                                         space reserved for boot firmware.

                             Pass-through devices:

                             slot/bus/function
                                         Connect to a PCI device on the host
                                         at the selector described by slot,
                                         bus, and function numbers.

                             Guest memory must be wired using the -S option
                             when a pass-through device is configured.

                             The host device must have been reserved at boot-
                             time using the pptdevs loader variable as
                             described in vmm(4).

                             Virtio console devices:

                             port1=/path/to/port1.sock,anotherport=...
                                         A maximum of 16 ports per device can
                                         be created.  Every port is named and
                                         corresponds to a Unix domain socket
                                         created by bhyve.  bhyve accepts at
                                         most one connection per port at a
                                         time.

                                         Limitations:

                                           •   Due to lack of destructors in
                                               bhyve, sockets on the
                                               filesystem must be cleaned up
                                               manually after bhyve exits.

                                           •   There is no way to use the
                                               "console port" feature, nor the
                                               console port resize at present.

                                           •   Emergency write is advertised,
                                               but no-op at present.

                             Framebuffer devices:

                                                   An IP address and a port
                                                   VNC should listen on.  The
                                                   default is to listen on
                                                   localhost IPv4 address and
                                                   default VNC port 5900.  An

                             Information structure.  By default a UUID is
                             generated from the host's hostname and vmname.

                             the same as that created by bhyveload(8).

DEBUG SERVER
     The current debug server provides limited support for debuggers.

   Registers
     Each virtual CPU is exposed to the debugger as a thread.

     General purpose registers can be queried for each virtual CPU, but other
     registers such as floating-point and system registers cannot be queried.

   Memory
     Memory (including memory mapped I/O regions) can be read by the debugger,
     but not written.  Memory operations use virtual addresses that are
     resolved to physical addresses via the current virtual CPU's active
     address translation.

   Control
     The running guest can be interrupted by the debugger at any time (for
     example, by pressing Ctrl-C in the debugger).

     Single stepping is only supported on Intel CPUs supporting the MTRAP VM
     exit.

     Breakpoints are supported on Intel CPUs that support single stepping.
     Note that continuing from a breakpoint while interrupts are enabled in
     the guest may not work as expected due to timer interrupts firing while
     single stepping over the breakpoint.

SIGNAL HANDLING
     bhyve deals with the following signals:

     SIGTERM
             Trigger ACPI poweroff for a VM

EXIT STATUS
     Exit status indicates how the VM was terminated:

     0       rebooted
     1       powered off
     2       halted
     3       triple fault
     4       exited due to an error

EXAMPLES
     If not using a boot ROM, the guest operating system must have been loaded
     with bhyveload(8) or a similar boot loader before bhyve(4) can be run.
     Otherwise, the boot loader is not needed.

     To run a virtual machine with 1GB of memory, two virtual CPUs, a virtio
     block device backed by the /my/image filesystem image, and a serial port
     for the console:

           bhyve -c 2 -s 0,hostbridge -s 1,lpc -s 2,virtio-blk,/my/image \
             -l com1,stdio -A -H -P -m 1G vm1

     Run a 24GB single-CPU virtual machine with three network ports, one of
     which has a MAC address specified:

           bhyve -s 0,hostbridge -s 1,lpc -s 2:0,virtio-net,tap0 \
             -s 2:1,virtio-net,tap1 \
             -s 2:2,virtio-net,tap2,mac=00:be:fa:76:45:00 \
             -s 3,virtio-blk,/my/image -l com1,stdio \
             -A -H -P -m 24G bigvm

     Run an 8GB quad-CPU virtual machine with 8 AHCI SATA disks, an AHCI ATAPI
     CD-ROM, a single virtio network port, an AMD hostbridge, and the console
     port connected to an nmdm(4) null-modem device.

             -l com1,/dev/nmdm0A \
             -A -H -P -m 8G

     Run a UEFI virtual machine with a display resolution of 800 by 600 pixels
     that can be accessed via VNC at: 0.0.0.0:5900.

           bhyve -c 2 -m 4G -w -H \

             -l bootrom,/usr/local/share/uefi-firmware/BHYVE_UEFI.fd \
              uefivm

     Run a UEFI virtual machine with a VNC display that is bound to all IPv6
     addresses on port 5900.

           bhyve -c 2 -m 4G -w -H \
