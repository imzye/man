NAME
       Iterator::Misc - Miscellaneous iterator functions.

VERSION
       This documentation describes version 0.03 of Iterator::Misc, August 26,
       2005.

SYNOPSIS
        use Iterator::Misc;

        # Permute the elements of a list:
        $iter = ipermute (@items);

        # Select only every nth value of an iterator
        $iter = inth ($n, $another_iterator);

        # Randomly select iterator values with 1/$n probability
        $iter = irand_nth ($n, $another_iterator);

        # Fibonacci sequence
        $ifib = ifibonacci();         # default sequence starts with 1,1
        $ifib = ifibonacci($a, $b);   # or specify alternate starting pair

        # Geometric sequence
        $iter = igeometric ($start, $end, $multiplier);

DESCRIPTION
       This module contains miscellaneous iterator utility functions that I
       think aren't as broadly useful as the ones in Iterator::Util.  They are
       here to keep the size of Iterator::Util down.

       For more information on iterators and how to use them, see the Iterator
       module documentation.

FUNCTIONS
       ipermute
            $iter = ipermute (@list);
            $array_ref = $iter->value();

           Permutes the items in an arbitrary list.  Each time the iterator is
           called, it returns the next combination of the items, in the form
           of a reference to an array.

           Example:

            $iter = ipermute ('one', 'two', 'three');
            $ref  = $iter->value();          # -> ['one', 'two', 'three']
            $ref  = $iter->value();          # -> ['one', 'three', 'two']
            $ref  = $iter->value();          # -> ['two', 'one', 'three']
            # ...etc

       inth
            $iter = inth ($n, $another_iterator);

           Returns an iterator to return every nth value from the input
           iterator.  The first "$n-1" items are skipped, then one is
           returned, then the next "$n-1" items are skipped, and so on.

           This can be useful for sampling data.

       irand_nth
            $iter = irand_nth ($n, $another_iterator);

           Random nth.  Returns an iterator to return items from the input
           iterator, with a probability of "1/$n" for each.  On average, in
           the long run, 1 of every $n items will be returned.

           This can be useful for random sampling of data.

       ifibonacci
            $iter = ifibonacci ();
            $iter = ifibonacci ($start);
            $iter = ifibonacci ($start1, $start2);

           Generates a Fibonacci sequence.  If starting values are not
           specified, uses (1, 1).  If only one is specified, it is used for
           both starting values.

       igeometric
            $iter = igeometric ($start, $end, $multiplier)

           Generates a geometric sequence.  If $end is undefined, the sequence
           is unbounded.

           Examples:

            $iter = igeometric (1, 27, 3);         # 1, 3, 9, 27.
            $iter = igeometric (1, undef, 3);      # 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, ...
            $iter = igeometric (10, undef, 0.1);   # 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01, ...

EXPORTS
       All function names are exported to the caller's namespace by default.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Iterator::Misc uses Exception::Class objects for throwing exceptions.
       If you're not familiar with Exception::Class, don't worry; these
       exception objects work just like $@ does with "die" and "croak", but
       they are easier to work with if you are trapping errors.

       For more information on how to handle these exception objects, see the
       Iterator documentation.

       •   Parameter Errors

           Class: "Iterator::X::Parameter_Error"

           You called an Iterator::Misc function with one or more bad
           parameters.  Since this is almost certainly a coding error, there
           is probably not much use in handling this sort of exception.

           As a string, this exception provides a human-readable message about
           what the problem was.

       •   Exhausted Iterators

           Class: "Iterator::X::Exhausted"

           You called value on an iterator that is exhausted; that is, there
           are no more values in the sequence to return.

           As a string, this exception is "Iterator is exhausted."

       •   User Code Exceptions

           Class: "Iterator::X::User_Code_Error"

           This exception is thrown when the sequence generation code throws
           any sort of error besides "Am_Now_Exhausted".  This could be
           because your code explicitly threw an error (that is, "die"d), or
           because it otherwise encountered an exception (any runtime error).

           This exception has one method, "eval_error", which returns the
           original $@ that was trapped by the Iterator object.  This may be a
           string or an object, depending on how "die" was invoked.

           As a string, this exception evaluates to the stringified $@.

       •   Internal Errors

           Class: "Iterator::X::Internal_Error"

           Something happened that I thought couldn't possibly happen.  I
           would appreciate it if you could send me an email message detailing
           the circumstances of the error.
