NAME
       Data::ICal - Generates iCalendar (RFC 2445) calendar files

SYNOPSIS
           use Data::ICal;

           my $calendar = Data::ICal->new();

           my $vtodo = Data::ICal::Entry::Todo->new();
           $vtodo->add_properties(
               # ... see Data::ICal::Entry::Todo documentation
           );

           # ... or
           $calendar = Data::ICal->new(filename => 'foo.ics'); # parse existing file
           $calendar = Data::ICal->new(data => 'BEGIN:VCALENDAR...'); # parse from scalar
           $calendar->add_entry($vtodo);
           print $calendar->as_string;

DESCRIPTION
       A Data::ICal object represents a "VCALENDAR" object as defined in the
       iCalendar protocol (RFC 2445, MIME type "text/calendar"), as
       implemented in many popular calendaring programs such as Apple's iCal.

       Each Data::ICal object is a collection of "entries", which are objects
       of a subclass of Data::ICal::Entry.  The types of entries defined by
       iCalendar (which refers to them as "components") include events, to-do
       items, journal entries, free/busy time indicators, and time zone
       descriptors; in addition, events and to-do items can contain alarm
       entries.  (Currently, Data::ICal only implements to-do items and
       events.)

       Data::ICal is a subclass of Data::ICal::Entry; see its manpage for more
       methods applicable to Data::ICal.

METHODS
   new [ data => $data, ] [ filename => $file ], [ calname => $string ], [
       vcal10 => $bool ], [ rfc_strict => $bool ], [ auto_uid => $bool ]
       Creates a new Data::ICal object.

       If it is given a filename or data argument is passed, then this parses
       the content of the file or string into the object.  If the "vcal10"
       flag is passed, parses it according to vCalendar 1.0, not iCalendar
       2.0; this in particular impacts the parsing of continuation lines in
       quoted-printable sections.

       If a calname is passed, sets x-wr-calname to the given string.
       Although not specified in RFC2445, most calendar software respects
       x-wr-calname as the displayed name of the calendar.

       If the "rfc_strict" flag is set to true, will require Data::ICal to
       include UIDs, as per RFC2445:

           4.8.4.7 Unique Identifier
           ... The property MUST be specified in the "VEVENT", "VTODO",
           "VJOURNAL" or "VFREEBUSY" calendar components"

       If the "auto_uid" flag is set to true, will automatically generate a
       default UID for each type which requires it, based on the RFC-suggested
       algorithm.  Explicitly-set UID attributes will override this auto-
       generated value.

       If a filename or data argument is not passed, this just sets the
       object's "VERSION" and "PRODID" properties to "2.0" (or "1.0" if the
       "vcal10" flag is passed) and the value of the "product_id" method
       respectively.

       Returns a false value upon failure to open or parse the file or data;
       this false value is a Class::ReturnValue object and can be queried as
       to its "error_message".

   parse [ data => $data, ] [ filename => $file, ]
       Parse a ".ics" file or string containing one, and populate $self with
       its contents.

       Should only be called once on a given object, and will be automatically
       called by "new" if you provide arguments to "new".

       Returns $self on success.  Returns a false value upon failure to open
       or parse the file or data; this false value is a Class::ReturnValue
       object and can be queried as to its "error_message".

   ical_entry_type
       Returns "VCALENDAR", its iCalendar entry name.

   product_id
       Returns the product ID used in the calendar's "PRODID" property; you
       may wish to override this in a subclass for your own application.

   mandatory_unique_properties
       According to the iCalendar standard, the following properties must be
       specified exactly one time for a calendar:

             prodid version

   optional_unique_properties
       According to the iCalendar standard, the following properties may be
       specified at most one time for a calendar:

             calscale method

DEPENDENCIES
       Data::ICal requires Class::Accessor, Text::vFile::asData,
       MIME::QuotedPrint, and Class::ReturnValue.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       Data::ICal does not support time zone daylight or standard entries, so
       time zone components are basically useless.

       While Data::ICal tries to check which properties are required and
       repeatable, this only works in simple cases; it does not check for
       properties that must either both exist or both not exist, or for
       mutually exclusive properties.

       Data::ICal does not check to see if property parameter names are known
       in general or allowed on the particular property.

       Data::ICal does not check to see if nested entries are nested properly
       (alarms in todos and events only, everything else in calendars only).

       The only property encoding supported by Data::ICal is quoted printable.
