NAME
       Lingua::ZH::Toke - Chinese Tokenizer

VERSION
       This document describes version 0.02 of Lingua::ZH::Toke, released
       January 11, 2004.

SYNOPSIS
           use Lingua::ZH::Toke;

           # -- if inputs are unicode strings, use the two lines below instead
           # use utf8;
           # use Lingua::ZH::Toke 'utf8';

           # Create Lingua::ZH::Toke::Sentence object (->Sentence also works)
           my $token = Lingua::ZH::Toke->new( '那人卻在/燈火闌珊處/益發意興闌珊' );

           # Easy tokenization via array deferencing
           print $token->[0]           # Fragment       - 那人卻在
                       ->[2]           # Phrase         - 卻在
                       ->[0]           # Character      - 卻
                       ->[0]           # Pronounciation - ㄑㄩㄝˋ
                       ->[2];          # Phonetic        - ㄝ

           # Magic histogram via hash deferencing
           print $token->{'那人卻在'};     # 1 - One such fragment there
           print $token->{'意興闌珊'};     # 1 - One such phrase there
           print $token->{'發意興闌'};     # undef - That's not a phrase
           print $token->{'珊'};        # 2 - Two such character there
           print $token->{'ㄧˋ'};       # 2 - Two such pronounciation: 益意
           print $token->{'ㄨ'};        # 3 - Three such phonetics: 那火處

           # Iteration over fragments
           while (my $fragment = <$token>) {
               # Iteration over phrases
               while (my $phrase = <$fragment>) {
                   # ...
               }
           }

DESCRIPTION
       This module puts a thin wrapper around Lingua::ZH::TaBE, by blessing
       refereces to TaBE's objects into its English counterparts.

       Besides offering more readable class names, this module also offers
       various overloaded methods for tokenization; please see "SYNOPSIS" for
       the three major ones.

       Since Lingua::ZH::TaBE is a Big5-oriented module, we also provide a
       simple utf8 layer around it; if you have Perl version 5.6.1 or later,
       just use this:

           use utf8;
           use Lingua::ZH::Toke 'utf8';

       With the "utf8" flag set, all Toke objects will stringify to unicode
       strings, and constructors will take either unicode strings, or
       big5-encoded bytestrings.

       Note that on Perl 5.6.x, Encode::compat is needed for the "utf8"
       feature to work.

METHODS
       The constructor methods correspond to the six object levels:
       "->Sentence", "->Fragment", "->Phrase", "->Character",
       "->Pronounciation" and "->Phonetic".  Each of them takes one string
       argument, representing the string to be tokenized.

       The "->new" method is an alias to "->"Sentence>.

       All object methods, except "->new", are passed to the underlying
       Lingua::ZH::TaBE object.

CAVEATS
       Under utf8 mode, you may sometimes need to explicitly stringify the
       return values, so their utf8 flag can be properly set:

           $value = $token->[0];       # this may or may not work
           $value = "$token->[0]";     # this is guaranteed to work

       This module does not care about efficiency or memory consumption yet,
       hence it's likely to fail miserably if you demand either of them.
       Patches welcome.

       As the name suggests, the chosen interface is very bizzare.  Use it at
       the risk of your own sanity.
