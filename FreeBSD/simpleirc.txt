SIC(1)                  FreeBSD General Commands Manual                 SIC(1)

NAME
       sic - simple irc client

SYNOPSIS
       sic [-h host] [-p port] [-n nick] [-k pass] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       sic is an extremely fast, small and simple irc client. It reads
       commands from standard input and prints all server output to standard
       output. It also multiplexes all channel traffic into one output. That
       way you don't have to switch different channel buffers. So that's
       actually a feature.

OPTIONS
       -h host
              Overrides the default host (irc.oftc.net)

       -p port
              Overrides the default port (6667)

       -n nick
              Override the default nick ($USER)

       -k pass
              Specifies the PASS connection password

       -v     Prints version information to stderr, then exits

       :j #channel

              Leave a channel
