SPECTRWM(1)             FreeBSD General Commands Manual            SPECTRWM(1)

NAME
     spectrwm – window manager for X11

SYNOPSIS
     spectrwm [-c file] [-v]

OPTIONS
     -c file
             Specify a configuration file to load instead of scanning for one.

     -d      Enable debug mode and logging to stderr.

     -v      Print version and exit.

DESCRIPTION
     spectrwm is a minimalistic window manager that tries to stay out of the
     way so that valuable screen real estate can be used for much more
     important stuff.  It has sane defaults and does not require one to learn
     a language to do any configuration.  It was written by hackers for
     hackers and it strives to be small, compact and fast.

     When spectrwm starts up, it reads settings from its configuration file,
     spectrwm.conf.  See the CONFIGURATION FILES section below.

     The following notation is used throughout this page:

           M       Meta
           S       Shift
           ⟨Name⟩  Named key or button

     spectrwm is very simple in its use.  Most of the actions are initiated
     via key or pointer button bindings.  See the BINDINGS section below for
     defaults and customizations.

CONFIGURATION FILES
     spectrwm looks for the user-configuration file in the following order:

           1.   $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/spectrwm/spectrwm.conf
           2.   ~/.config/spectrwm/spectrwm.conf (if $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is
                either not set or empty)
           3.   ~/.spectrwm.conf.

     If the user-configuration file is not found, spectrwm then looks for the
     global configuration file in the following order:

           1.   $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/spectrwm/spectrwm.conf (each colon-separated
                directory in $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS)
           2.   /usr/local/etc/xdg/spectrwm/spectrwm.conf (if $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS
                is either not set or empty)
           3.   /usr/local/etc/spectrwm.conf

     The format of the file is

           keyword = setting

     Where ‘=’ may be replaced with ‘+=’ or ‘-=’, if supported by the option.

     For example:

           color_focus = red
           quirk[XTerm] += FLOAT

     Enabling or disabling an option is done by using 1 or 0 respectively.

     Colors need to be specified per the XQueryColor(3) specification.  In
     addition, alpha transparency may be specified via the format
     rbga:red/green/blue/alpha (8-bit hex values) For example, to specify a
     50% transparent blue status bar background:

           bar_color = rgba:00/00/ff/7f

     Note that a compositing manager is required for alpha transparency.

     Mark option values may be wrapped in single/double quotes to prevent
     whitespace trimming, specify empty strings, etc.  Literal quote/backslash
     characters can be escaped with a backslash ‘\’, when needed.

     Comments begin with a #.  When a literal ‘#’ is desired in an option,
     then it must be escaped with a backslash, i.e. \#

     The file supports the following keywords:

     autorun
         Launch an application in a specified workspace at start-of-day.
         Defined in the format ws[idx]:application, e.g. ws[2]:xterm launches
         an xterm(1) in workspace 2.  Specify ‘ws[-1]’ to launch applications
         such as desktop managers and panels in free mode to keep them always
         mapped.

         Note that libswmhack.so is required for "spawn-in-workspace"
         behavior.  See the SWMHACK section below for more information, tips,
         and workarounds if a program fails to spawn in the specified
         workspace.

     bar_action
         External script that populates additional information in the status
         bar, such as battery life.

     bar_action_expand
         Process bar_format character sequences in bar_action output; default
         is 0.

     bar_at_bottom
         Place the statusbar at the bottom of each region instead of the top.
         Default is 0.

     bar_border[x]
         Border color of status bar(s) on screen number x.  Default is
         rgb:00/80/80.

     bar_border_free[x]
         Border color of a status bar for a focused region on screen number x
         when a workspace-free window is focused.  Default is rgb:80/80/00.

     bar_border_unfocus[x]
         Border color of status bar(s) for unfocused region(s) on screen
         number x.  Default is rgb:00/40/40.

     bar_border_width
         Set status bar border thickness in pixels.  Disable border by setting
         to 0.

     bar_color[x]
         Background color of status bar(s) on screen number x.

         A comma-separated list of multiple colors can be specified.  The
         first value is used as the default background color.  Any of these
         colors can then be selected as a background color in the status bar
         through the use of the markup sequence +@bg=n; where n is the color
         index counting from 0.

     bar_color_free[x]
         Background color of a status bar for a focused region on screen
         number x when a workspace-free window is focused.

         A comma-separated list of multiple colors can be specified, with the
         same syntax and behavior as bar_color.  Default is rgb:40/40/00.

         Note that bar_color defines the background color indices that can be
         used in bar_format markup sequences and is the fallback for colors
         that are left unspecified in this option.

     bar_color_selected[x]
         Background color for selected menu items on screen number x.
         Defaults to the value of bar_border.

     bar_color_unfocus[x]
         Background color of status bar(s) for unfocused region(s) on screen
         number x.

         A comma-separated list of multiple colors can be specified, with the
         same syntax and behavior as bar_color for unfocused bar(s).  Defaults
         to the value of bar_color.

         Note that bar_color defines the background color indices that can be
         used in bar_format markup sequences and is the fallback for colors
         that are left unspecified in this option.

     bar_enabled
         Set default bar_toggle state; default is 1.

     bar_enabled_ws[x]
         Set default bar_toggle_ws state on workspace x; default is 1.

     bar_font
         Fonts used in the status bar.  Either Xft or X Logical Font
         Description (XLFD) may be used to specify fonts.  Fallback fonts may
         be specified by separating each font with a comma.  If all entries
         are in XLFD syntax, font set will be used.  If at least one entry is
         Xft, Xft will be used.

         The default is to use font set.

         If Xft is used, a comma-separated list of multiple fonts can be
         specified.  The first entry is the default font.  Any font defined
         here can then be selected in the status bar through the use of the
         markup sequence +@fn=n; where n is the font index counting from 0.

         Also note that dmenu(1) prior to 4.6 does not support Xft fonts.

         Xft examples:

               bar_font = Terminus:style=Regular:pixelsize=14:antialias=true

               bar_font = -*-profont-medium-*-*-*-11-*-*-*-*-*-*-*,Terminus:pixelsize=14,-*-clean-medium-*-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

         Font set examples:

               bar_font = -*-terminus-medium-*-*-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

               bar_font = -*-profont-medium-*-*-*-11-*-*-*-*-*-*-*,-*-terminus-medium-*-*-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-*-*,-*-clean-medium-*-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

         To list the available fonts in your system see fc-list(1) or
         xlsfonts(1) manpages.  The xfontsel(1) application can help with the
         XLFD setting.

     bar_font_color[x]
         Foreground color of the status bar(s) on screen number x.

         A comma-separated list of multiple colors can be specified.  The
         first value is used as the default foreground color.  Any of these
         colors can then be selected as a foreground color in the status bar
         through the use of the markup sequence +@fg=n; where n is the color
         index counting from 0.

     bar_font_color_free[x]
         Foreground color of a status bar for a focused region on screen
         number x when a workspace-free window is focused.

         A comma-separated list of multiple colors can be specified, with the
         same syntax and behavior as bar_font_color.  Default is rgb:ff/ff/ff.

         Note that bar_font_color defines the foreground color indices that
         can be used in bar_format markup sequences and is the fallback for
         colors that are left unspecified in this option.

     bar_font_color_unfocus[x]
         Foreground color of status bar(s) for unfocused region(s) on screen
         number x.

         A comma-separated list of multiple colors can be specified, with the
         same syntax and behavior as bar_font_color for unfocused bar(s).
         Defaults to the value of bar_font_color.

         Note that bar_font_color defines the foreground color indices that
         can be used in bar_format markup sequences and is the fallback for
         colors that are left unspecified in this option.

     bar_font_color_selected[x]
         Foreground color for selected menu items on screen number x.
         Defaults to the value of bar_color.

     bar_font_pua
         Specify a font to override the Unicode Private Use Area code points
         (U+E000 -> U+F8FF, U+F0000 -> U+FFFFD, U+100000 -> U+10FFFD).  Some
         fonts use these code points to provide special icon glyphs.
         Available only with Xft fonts.

     bar_format
         Set the bar format string, overriding clock_format and all of the
         enabled options.  The format is passed through strftime(3) before
         being used.  It may contain the following character sequences:

               Character sequence    Replaced with
               +<                    Pad with a space
               +A                    Output of the external script
               +C                    Window class (from WM_CLASS)
               +D                    Workspace name
               +F                    Focus status indicator
               +I                    Workspace index
               +L                    Workspace list indicator
               +M                    Number of iconic (minimized) windows in
                                     workspace
               +N                    Screen number
               +P                    Window class and instance separated by a
                                     colon
               +R                    Region index
               +S                    Stacking algorithm
               +T                    Window instance (from WM_CLASS)
               +U                    Urgency hint
               +V                    Program version
               +w                    Number of windows in workspace
               +W                    Window name (from _NET_WM_NAME/WM_NAME)
               +|[weight][justify]   Begin new section and reset markup
                                     sequence effects.

                                     weight is a positive integer used to
                                     allocate horizontal space between 'L',
                                     'C' and 'R' sections (see justify).  The
                                     default weight is 1.

                                     justify can have the value L, C, R or T.
                                     L, C, R are for left, center and right
                                     justified sections respectively.  A 'T'
                                     section will limit its space usage to fit
                                     to the text.  If no value is specified
                                     for a given section, the setting from
                                     bar_justify is used.
               ++                    A literal ‘+’
               +@                    Prefix for text markup sequences

         The currently recognized text markup sequences are:

               Character sequence    Action
               +@fn=n;               Selects font n (starting at 0) from
                                     bar_font.
               +@fg=n;               Selects foreground color n (starting at
                                     0) from bar_font_color.
               +@bg=n;               Selects background color n (starting at
                                     0) from bar_color.
               +@stp;                Stops the interpretation of markup
                                     sequences. Any markup sequence found
                                     after +@stp will appear as normal
                                     characters in the status bar.

         Note that markup sequences in bar_action script output will only be
         processed if bar_action_expand is enabled.

         All character sequences may limit its output to a specific length,
         for example +64A.  By default, no padding/alignment is done in case
         the length of the replaced string is less than the specified length
         (64 in the example).  The padding/alignment can be enabled using a
         '_' character in the sequence.  For example: +_64W, +64_W and +_64_W
         enable padding before (right alignment), after (left alignment), and
         both before and after (center alignment) window name, respectively.
         Any characters that do not match the specification are copied as-is.

     bar_justify
         Justify the status bar text.  Possible values are left, center, and
         right.

         Note that if the output is not left justified, it may not be properly
         aligned in some circumstances, due to the white-spaces in the default
         static format.  See the bar_format option for more details.

     bar_workspace_limit
         Set the maximum workspace index (counting from 1) to list in the
         status bar workspace (+L) and urgency hint (+U) indicators.
         Workspaces beyond this value will not be shown.  Default is 0
         (disabled).

     bind[x]
         Bind key or button combo to action x.  See the BINDINGS section
         below.

     border_width
         Set window border thickness in pixels.  Disable all borders by
         setting to 0.

     boundary_width
         Set region containment boundary width in pixels.  This is how far a
         window must be dragged/resized (with the pointer) beyond the region
         edge before it is allowed outside the region.  Disable the window
         containment effect by setting to 0.

     cancelkey
         Change the key used as an alternative means of terminating
         move/resize operations.  Default is Escape.

         See the BINDINGS section below for details on how to find key names.

     click_to_raise
         Enable or disable raising stacking priority when clicking on a
         window.  Default is 1.

     clock_enabled
         Enable or disable displaying the clock in the status bar.  Disable by
         setting to 0 so a custom clock could be used in the bar_action
         script.

     color_focus_free
         Border color of the currently focused window that is in free mode.
         Default is yellow.

     color_focus_maximized_free
         Border color of the currently focused maximized window that is in
         free mode.  Defaults to the value of color_focus_free.

     color_unfocus_free
         Border color of unfocused windows that are in free mode, default is
         rgb:88/88/00.

     color_unfocus_maximized_free
         Border color of unfocused maximized windows that are in free mode.
         Defaults to the value of color_unfocus_free.

     color_urgent_free
         Border color of urgent windows that are in free mode.  Defaults to
         the value of color_unfocus_free.

     color_urgent_maximized_free
         Border color of urgent maximized windows that are in free mode.
         Defaults to the value of color_urgent_free.

     color_focus
         Border color of the currently focused window.  Default is red.

     color_focus_maximized
         Border color of the currently focused, maximized window.  Defaults to
         the value of color_focus.

     color_unfocus
         Border color of unfocused windows, default is rgb:88/88/88.

     color_unfocus_maximized
         Border color of unfocused, maximized windows.  Defaults to the value
         of color_unfocus.

     color_urgent
         Border color of urgent windows.  Defaults to the value of
         color_unfocus.

     color_urgent_maximized
         Border color of urgent, maximized windows.  Defaults to the value of
         color_urgent.

     cycle_visible
         Include workspaces that are mapped when switching with ws_next,
         ws_prev, ws_next_all, ws_prev_all, ws_next_move, or ws_prev_move.
         Enable by setting to 1.

         Note that mapped workspaces will be swapped unless workspace_clamp is
         enabled.  If warp_focus is also enabled, focus will go to the region
         where the workspace is mapped.

     dialog_ratio
         Some applications have dialogue windows that are too small to be
         useful.  This ratio adjusts the window/region size ratio for
         transient windows having the TRANSSZ quirk.  For example, 0.6 is 60%
         of the the monitor size if the current region spans the monitor.

     disable_border
         Remove border when bar is disabled and there is only one window on
         the region.  Enable by setting to 1.  Setting this to always removes
         the border regardless of the bar being enabled/disabled.  Defaults to
         0.

     focus_close
         Window to put focus when the focused window is closed.  Possible
         values are first, next, previous (default), last and prior.  next and
         previous are relative to the window that is closed.  prior is the
         last focused window in the workspace.

     focus_close_wrap
         Whether to allow the focus to jump to the last window when the first
         window is closed or vice versa.  Disable by setting to 0.

     focus_default
         Window to put focus when no window has been focused.  Possible values
         are first and last (default).

     focus_mark_none
         Set the bar_format focus status indicator (+F) string to substitute
         when no window is focused.  Default is ''.

     focus_mark_normal
         Set the bar_format focus status indicator (+F) string to substitute
         when a normal (not floating, maximized or free) window is focused.
         Default is ''.

     focus_mark_floating
         Set the bar_format focus status indicator (+F) string to substitute
         when a floating window is focused.  Default is '(f)'.

     focus_mark_free
         Set the bar_format focus status indicator (+F) string to substitute
         when a window that is in free mode is focused.  Default is '(*)'.

     focus_mark_maximized
         Set the bar_format focus status indicator (+F) string to substitute
         when a maximized window is focused.  Default is '(m)'.

     focus_mode[t]
         Set window focus behavior with respect to the pointer.  Possible
         values:

               default  Set window focus on border crossings caused by cursor
                        motion and window interaction.
               follow   Prioritize the pointer location.  Set window focus on
                        all cursor border crossings, including workspace
                        switches and changes to layout.
               manual   Ignore the pointer location.  Set window focus on
                        window interaction only.

         Optionally, it is possible to adjust the focus mode for specific
         focus situations.  A comma-separated list of the following situations
         can be specified for t:

               border     Pointer enters a window.  Default is follow.
               configure  Window position/size changed by the client/EWMH.
                          Default is manual.
               iconify    Window iconified.  Default is manual.
               layout     Workspace layout changed.  Default is manual.
               map        Window maps.  Default is manual.
               move       Window moved to another workspace.  Default is
                          manual.
               startup    spectrwm (re)started.  Default is manual.
               uniconify  Window uniconified.  Default is manual.
               unmap      Window unmaps.  Default is manual.
               workspace  Workspace switched.  Default is manual.

         Note that when t is omitted, the specified setting is applied to all
         focus situations.  Example:

               focus_mode = follow # Set all focus situations to 'follow'.
               focus_mode[map,unmap] = manual # Change only map and unmap to 'manual'.
               focus_mode = default # Reset all focus situations to respective default values.

     fullscreen_hide_other
         When a fullscreen window is focused and not in below state, hide
         unrelated windows in the same workspace.  Useful for transparent
         windows.  Defaults to 0.

     fullscreen_unfocus
         Set handling when a fullscreen window loses focus.  Possible values:

               none            Leave window fullscreen.  (default)
               restore         Exit fullscreen.
               iconify         Minimize/hide the window.
               float           Exit fullscreen and float window.
               below           Set below state on the window.
               quick_below     Set below state on the window, unset when
                               refocused.

         Note that this option is ignored in max layout.

     iconic_enabled
         Display the number of iconic (minimized) windows in the status bar.
         Enable by setting to 1.

     keyboard_mapping
         Clear all key bindings (not button bindings) and load new bindings
         from the specified file.  This allows you to load pre-defined key
         bindings for your keyboard layout.  See the KEYBOARD MAPPING FILES
         section below for a list of keyboard mapping files that have been
         provided for several keyboard layouts.

         Note that /dev/null can be specified if you only want to clear
         bindings.

     layout
         Select layout to use at start-of-day.  Defined in the format
         ws[idx]:master_grow:master_add:stack_inc:always_raise:stack_mode,
         e.g. ws[2]:-4:0:1:0:horizontal sets workspace 2 to the horizontal
         stack mode, shrinks the master area by 4 ticks and adds one window to
         the stack, while maintaining default floating window behavior.
         Possible stack_mode values are vertical, vertical_flip, horizontal,
         horizontal_flip, max and floating.

         See master_grow, master_shrink, master_add, master_del, stack_inc,
         stack_dec, stack_balance, and always_raise for more information.
         Note that the stacking options are complicated and have side-effects.
         One should familiarize oneself with these commands before
         experimenting with the layout option.

         This setting is not retained at restart.

     layout_order
         Define the layout sequence used by the cycle_layout action.  Possible
         values are vertical, horizontal, max and floating.  At least one
         value must be specified, without duplicates.  The default is
         vertical,horizontal,max,floating.

     max_layout_maximize
         Automatically maximize windows in max layout.  Note that automatic
         maximize behavior is disabled for windows that are unmaximized in max
         layout.  Maximizing the window or resetting the layout with
         stack_reset enables it again.  Enabled by default.  Disable by
         setting to 0.

     maximize_hide_bar
         When set to 1, maximize_toggle will also hide/restore the bar
         visibility of the affected workspace.  Defaults to 0.

     maximize_hide_other
         When a maximized window is focused and not in below state, hide
         unrelated windows in the same workspace.  Useful for transparent
         windows.  Defaults to 0.

     maximized_unfocus
         Set handling when a maximized window loses focus.  Possible values:

               none            Leave window maximized.
               restore         Unmaximize window.  (default)
               iconify         Minimize/hide the window.
               float           Unmaximize and float window.
               below           Set below state on the window.
               quick_below     Set below state on the window, unset when
                               refocused.

         Note that this option is ignored in max layout.

     modkey
         Change the current modifier value of MOD in bind entries that come
         later in the configuration file.  For existing bindings, the new
         value is substituted for the previous value.  Possible values are
         Mod1 (default), Mod2, Mod3, Mod4 and Mod5.

         Mod1 is generally the Alt key, Mod2 is the Command key on macOS and
         Mod4 is the Windows key on a PC.  The current modifier key mapping
         can be found by running xmodmap(1).

     name
         Set the name of a workspace at start-of-day.  Defined in the format
         ws[idx]:name, e.g. ws[1]:Console sets the name of workspace 1 to
         “Console”.

     program[p]
         Define new action to spawn a program p.  See the PROGRAMS section
         below.

     quirk[c[:i[:n[:t]]]]
         Add "quirk" for windows with class c, instance i (optional), name n
         (optional), and type t (optional.)  See the QUIRKS section below.

     region
         Allocates a custom region, removing any autodetected regions that
         occupy the same space on the specified logical X screen number.
         Defined in the format screen[idx]:widthxheight+x+y[,rotation], e.g.
         screen[1]:800x1200+0+0 or screen[1]:800x1200+0+0,inverted (with
         optional rotation).

         To make a region span multiple monitors, create a region big enough
         to cover them all, e.g. screen[1]:2048x768+0+0 makes the region span
         two monitors with 1024x768 resolution sitting one next to the other.

         Possible values for the optional rotation argument are normal
         (default), left, inverted and right.  Note that rotation is used by
         workspace_autorotate.

     region_padding
         Pixel width of empty space within region borders.  Disable by setting
         to 0.

     snap_range
         Set the distance in pixels a tiled/maximized window must be moved
         (with the pointer) to unsnap and float freely.  Set to 0 to unsnap
         immediately.  Default is 25.

     spawn_flags[p]
         If search pattern p is specified, change the spawn flags of existing
         program entries.  If p is omitted, change the default spawn flags for
         any program or autorun entries that come later in the configuration
         file.  Note that p is interpreted as a POSIX Extended Regular
         Expression.

         One or more of the following flags may be specified in a comma-
         separated list:

               nospawnws       When the program is spawned, do not associate
                               the spawn workspace with the program's windows.
               xterm_fontadj   Enables automatic font size adjustments when
                               resizing xterm(1) windows.  Note that this
                               works in conjunction with the term_width option
                               and the XTERM_FONTADJ quirk.  See the
                               term_width option and QUIRKS section for more
                               information.
               optional        Disable program validation.
               none            No flags specified.

         The default is none.

         In addition to the ‘=’ operator, this option also supports ‘+=’ and
         ‘-=’ to add/remove flags instead of replacing them.

         Note that the default of associating windows with the spawn workspace
         and the xterm_fontadj flag both rely on libswmhack.so.  See the
         SWMHACK section below for more information.

     spawn_position
         Position in stack to place newly spawned windows.  Possible values
         are first, next, previous and last (default).  next and previous are
         relative to the focused window.

     stack_enabled
         Enable or disable displaying the current stacking algorithm in the
         status bar.

     stack_mark_floating
         Set the floating layout mark for the bar_format stacking indicator
         (+S).  Default is '[~]'.

     stack_mark_horizontal
         Set the horizontal layout mark for the bar_format stacking indicator
         (+S).  Default is '[-]'.

     stack_mark_horizontal_flip
         Set the horizontal_flip layout mark for the bar_format stacking
         indicator (+S).  Default is '[v]'.

     stack_mark_max
         Set the max layout mark for the bar_format stacking indicator (+S).
         Default is '[ ]'.

     stack_mark_vertical
         Set the vertical layout mark for the bar_format stacking indicator
         (+S).  Default is '[|]'.

     stack_mark_vertical_flip
         Set the vertical_flip layout mark for the bar_format stacking
         indicator (+S).  Default is '[>]'.

     term_width
         Set a preferred minimum width for the terminal.  If this value is
         greater than 0, spectrwm will attempt to adjust the font sizes in the
         terminal to keep the terminal width above this number as the window
         is resized.

         Note that only xterm(1) is currently supported.  The terminal process
         must be spawned with the xterm_fontadj spawn flag and the
         XTERM_FONTADJ quirk must be set on its window.  See the spawn_flags
         option and the QUIRKS section for more information.  In addition, the
         xterm(1) binary must not be setuid or setgid, which it is by default
         on most systems.  Users may need to set program[term] (see the
         PROGRAMS section) to use an alternate copy of the xterm(1) binary
         without the setgid bit set.

     tile_gap
         Pixel width of empty space between tiled windows.  Negative values
         cause overlap.  Set this to the opposite of border_width to collapse
         the border between tiles.  Disable by setting to 0.

     urgent_collapse
         Minimizes the space consumed by the urgency hint indicator by
         removing the placeholders for non-urgent workspaces, the trailing
         space when there are urgent windows and the default leading space.
         Enable by setting to 1.

     urgent_enabled
         Enable or disable the urgency hint indicator in the status bar.  Note
         that many terminal emulators require an explicit setting for the bell
         character to trigger urgency on the window.  In xterm(1), for
         example, one needs to add the following line to .Xdefaults:

               xterm.bellIsUrgent: true

     verbose_layout
         Enable or disable displaying the current master window count and
         stack column/row count in the status bar.  Enable by setting to 1.
         See master_add, master_del, stack_inc and stack_dec for more
         information.

     warp_focus
         Focus on the target window/workspace/region when clamped.  For
         example, when attempting to switch to a workspace that is mapped on
         another region and workspace_clamp is enabled, focus on the region
         with the target workspace.  Enable by setting to 1.

     warp_pointer
         Centers the pointer on the focused window when using bindings to
         change focus, switch workspaces, change regions, etc.  Enable by
         setting to 1.  Note that this option is ignored in focus_mode
         situations set to follow.

     window_class_enabled
         Enable or disable displaying the window class name (from WM_CLASS) in
         the status bar.  Enable by setting to 1.

     window_instance_enabled
         Enable or disable displaying the window instance name (from WM_CLASS)
         in the status bar.  Enable by setting to 1.

     window_name_enabled
         Enable or disable displaying the window display name (from
         _NET_WM_NAME/WM_NAME) in the status bar.  Enable by setting to 1.

         To prevent excessively large window names from pushing the remaining
         text off the bar, it is limited to 64 characters, by default.  See
         the bar_format option for more details.

     workspace_autorotate
         When moving workspaces across regions, auto-rotate
         vertical/horizontal layouts based on rotation data from xrandr(1).
         Enable by setting to 1.

     workspace_clamp
         Prevents workspaces from being swapped when attempting to switch to a
         workspace that is mapped to another region.  Use warp_focus if you
         want to focus on the region containing the workspace and warp_pointer
         if you want to also send the pointer.  Enable by setting to 1.

     workspace_indicator
         Configure the status bar workspace indicator.  One or more of the
         following options may be specified in a comma-separated list:

               listcurrent     Include the current workspace.
               listactive      Include workspaces with windows.
               listempty       Include empty workspaces.
               listnamed       Include named workspaces.
               listurgent      Include workspaces with urgent window(s).
               listall         Include all workspaces.
               hidecurrent     Always exclude the current workspace from the
                               list.
               markcurrent     Indicate the current workspace if it is in the
                               list.
               markactive      Indicate workspaces in the list that are
                               active.
               markempty       Indicate workspaces in the list that are empty.
               markurgent      Indicate workspaces in the list that contain
                               urgent window(s).
               printnames      Display the names of named workspaces in the
                               list.
               noindexes       Hide the index of the workspaces.

         The default is listcurrent,listactive,markcurrent,printnames

         Note that markup sequences can be used to style the workspace
         indicator.  For example, to change the color of the current
         workspace:

               workspace_mark_current = '+@fg=1;'
               workspace_mark_current_suffix = '+@fg=0;'

     workspace_limit
         Set the total number of workspaces available.  Minimum is 1, maximum
         is 22, default is 10.

     workspace_mark_active
         Set the string inserted before active workspaces in the
         workspace_indicator.  Default is '^'.

     workspace_mark_active_suffix
         Set the string inserted after active workspaces in the
         workspace_indicator.  Default is '' (empty string).

     workspace_mark_current
         Set the string inserted before the current workspace in the
         workspace_indicator.  Default is '*'.

     workspace_mark_current_suffix
         Set the string inserted after the current workspace in the
         workspace_indicator.  Default is '' (empty string).

     workspace_mark_empty
         Set the string inserted before empty workspaces in the
         workspace_indicator.  Default is '-'.

     workspace_mark_empty_suffix
         Set the string inserted after empty workspaces in the
         workspace_indicator.  Default is '' (empty string).

     workspace_mark_urgent
         Set the string inserted before urgent workspaces in the
         workspace_indicator.  Default is '!'.

     workspace_mark_urgent_suffix
         Set the string inserted after urgent workspaces in the
         workspace_indicator.  Default is '' (empty string).

STACK MODES
     vertical            Master area is on the left and stack area is on the
                         right.  Additional windows are vertically tiled in
                         stack area.

     vertical flipped    Same as above but stack and master areas are swapped.

     horizontal          Master area is on the top and stack area is on the
                         bottom.  Additional windows are horizontally tiled in
                         stack area.

     horizontal flipped  Same as above but stack and master areas are swapped.

     max                 The focused window occupies the whole region, except
                         for the bar (if enabled).

     floating            Windows are untiled and can be resized and
                         positioned.

WINDOW STATES
     These can be set/unset by the corresponding toggle actions listed in the
     BINDINGS section below.

     floating    The window is stacked above others and is not in a tile; it
                 may be freely resized and positioned.

     below       The window is floating, but stacked below others.

     maximized   The window occupies the work area of the region (area that
                 excludes space reserved by the bar, docks/panels, etc.)  By
                 default, focusing another window removes the maximized state
                 of the window.  See maximized_unfocus to configure unfocused
                 behavior.

     fullscreen  The window occupies the whole region.  By default, focusing
                 another window does not remove the fullscreen state of the
                 window.  See fullscreen_unfocus to configure unfocused
                 behavior.

     free        The window is floating, but not bound by regions, workspaces
                 or their layouts.  It is always mapped, unless iconified, and
                 may be resized and positioned anywhere.

PROGRAMS
     spectrwm allows you to define custom actions to launch programs of your
     choice and then bind them the same as with built-in actions.  See the
     BINDINGS section below.

     Custom programs in the configuration file are specified as follows:

           program[action] = progpath [arg [arg ...]]

     action is any identifier that does not conflict with a built-in action or
     keyword, progpath is the desired program, and arg is zero or more
     arguments to the program.

     With the exception of '~' expansion, program calls are executed as-is
     without any interpretation.  A shell can be called to execute shell
     commands.  (e.g. sh -c 'command string').

     Remember that when using ‘#’ in your program call, it must be escaped
     with a backslash, i.e. \#

     The following argument variables are replaced with values at the time the
     program is spawned:

           $bar_border
           $bar_color
           $bar_color_selected
           $bar_font
           $bar_font_color
           $bar_font_color_selected
           $color_focus
           $color_unfocus
           $color_urgent
           $dmenu_bottom    -b if bar_at_bottom is enabled, otherwise ''
                            (empty string.)
           $region_index
           $workspace_index

     Example:

           program[ff] = /usr/local/bin/firefox http://spectrwm.org/
           bind[ff] = MOD+Shift+b # Now M-S-b launches firefox

     To cancel the previous, unbind it:

           bind[] = MOD+Shift+b

     A number of built-in actions spawn a program as part of their
     implementation.  The respective default program entries are as follows:

           term             xterm
           lock             xlock
           menu             dmenu_run $dmenu_bottom -fn $bar_font -nb
                            $bar_color -nf $bar_font_color -sb
                            $bar_color_selected -sf $bar_font_color_selected
           search           dmenu $dmenu_bottom -i -fn $bar_font -nb
                            $bar_color -nf $bar_font_color -sb
                            $bar_color_selected -sf $bar_font_color_selected
           name_workspace   dmenu $dmenu_bottom -p Workspace -fn $bar_font -nb
                            $bar_color -nf $bar_font_color -sb
                            $bar_color_selected -sf $bar_font_color_selected
           initscr          initscreen.sh        # optional
           screenshot_all   screenshot.sh full   # optional
           screenshot_wind  screenshot.sh window # optional

     Note that search is required by the search_win, search_workspace, and
     uniconify actions and does not have a direct binding.

     With the exception of the default entries marked “optional”, validation
     is performed to ensure the program exists.  If validation fails, the
     exception can be resolved by installing the program, adding the optional
     flag to the program entry's spawn flags, or by disabling the program
     entry by freeing the respective binding.

     For example, to add the optional flag to lock:

           spawn_flags[lock] += optional

     To unbind lock and prevent it from being validated:

           bind[] = MOD+Shift+Delete

     Note that when a program is spawned, spectrwm aims to place its windows
     in its spawn workspace.  See the SWMHACK section below for more
     information, tips, and workarounds if a program fails to spawn in the
     correct workspace.

BINDINGS

     Custom bindings in the configuration file are specified as follows:

           bind[action] = combo

     action is one of the actions listed above (or empty to unbind) and combo
     is in the form of zero or more modifier keys and/or special arguments
     (Mod1, Shift, Control, MOD, etc.) and a normal key (b, Space, etc) or a
     button (Button1 .. Button255), separated by ‘+’.  Multiple key/button
     combinations may be bound to the same action.

     Special arguments:

           MOD         Substituted for the currently defined modkey.
           ANYMOD      Select all modifier combinations not handled by another
                       binding.
           REPLAY      Reprocess binding press/release events for other
                       programs to handle.  Unavailable for move, resize and
                       resize_centered.

     MOD example:

           bind[reset] = Mod4+q # bind Windows-key + q to reset
           bind[] = Mod1+q # unbind Alt + q
           bind[move] = MOD+Button3 # Bind move to M-Button3
           bind[] = MOD+Button1 # Unbind default move binding.

     ANYMOD example:

           bind[focus] = ANYMOD+Button3
           bind[move] = MOD+Button3

     In the above example, M-⟨Button3⟩ initiates move and ⟨Button3⟩ pressed
     with any other combination of modifiers sets focus to the window/region
     under the pointer.

     REPLAY example:

           bind[focus] = REPLAY+Button3

     In the above example, when ⟨Button3⟩ is pressed without any modifier(s),
     focus is set to the window under the pointer and the button press is
     passed to the window.

     To bind non-latin characters such as å or π you must enter the xkb
     character name instead of the character itself.  Run xev(1), focus the
     window and press the specific key and in the terminal output read the
     symbol name.  In the following example for å:

           KeyPress event, serial 41, synthetic NO, window 0x2600001,
               root 0x15a, subw 0x0, time 106213808, (11,5), root:(359,823),
               state 0x0, keycode 24 (keysym 0xe5, aring), same_screen YES,
               XLookupString gives 2 bytes: (c3 a5) "å"
               XmbLookupString gives 2 bytes: (c3 a5) "å"
               XFilterEvent returns: False

     The xkb name is aring.  In other words, in spectrwm.conf add:

           bind[program] = MOD+aring

     To clear all default keyboard bindings and specify your own, see the

QUIRKS
     spectrwm provides "quirks" which handle windows that must be treated
     specially in a tiling window manager, such as some dialogs and fullscreen
     apps.

     The default quirks are described below:

           .*:.*:.*:splash,dialog                  FLOAT
           .*:.*:.*:toolbar,utility                FLOAT + ANYWHERE
           .*:.*:.*:notification                   FLOAT + ANYWHERE +
                                                   MINIMALBORDER +
                                                   NOFOCUSONMAP
           Firefox-bin:firefox-bin                 TRANSSZ
           Firefox:Dialog                          FLOAT
           Gimp:gimp                               FLOAT + ANYWHERE
           MPlayer:xv                              FLOAT + FULLSCREEN +
                                                   FOCUSPREV
           OpenOffice.org 2.4:VCLSalFrame          FLOAT
           OpenOffice.org 3.1:VCLSalFrame          FLOAT
           pcb:pcb                                 FLOAT
           xine:Xine Window                        FLOAT + ANYWHERE
           xine:xine Panel                         FLOAT + ANYWHERE
           xine:xine Video Fullscreen Window       FULLSCREEN + FLOAT
           Xitk:Xitk Combo                         FLOAT + ANYWHERE
           Xitk:Xine Window                        FLOAT + ANYWHERE
           XTerm:xterm                             XTERM_FONTADJ

     The quirks themselves are described below:

           ANYWHERE               Allow window to position itself, uncentered.
           BELOW                  Put the window into below state upon being
                                  managed.
           FLOAT                  This window should not be tiled, but allowed
                                  to float freely.
           FOCUSONMAP_SINGLE      When the window first appears on the screen,
                                  change focus to the window if there are no
                                  other windows on the workspace with the same
                                  WM_CLASS class/instance value.  Has no
                                  effect when focus_mode is set to follow.
           FOCUSPREV              On exit force focus on previously focused
                                  application not previous application in the
                                  stack.
           FULLSCREEN             Remove border to allow window to use full
                                  region size.
           ICONIFY                Hide/minimize the window upon being managed.
           IGNOREPID              Ignore the PID when determining the initial
                                  workspace for a new window.  Especially
                                  useful for terminal windows that share a
                                  process.
           IGNORESPAWNWS          Ignore the spawn workspace when determining
                                  the initial workspace for a new window.
           MAXIMIZE               Put the window into maximized state upon
                                  being managed.
           MINIMALBORDER          Remove border when window is unfocused and
                                  floating.
           NOFOCUSCYCLE           Remove from normal focus cycle (focus_prev
                                  or focus_next). The window can still be
                                  focused using search_win.
           NOFOCUSONMAP           Do not change focus to the window when it
                                  first appears on the screen.  Has no effect
                                  when focus_mode is set to follow.
           OBEYAPPFOCUSREQ        When an application requests focus on the
                                  window via a _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW client
                                  message (source indication of 1), comply
                                  with the request.  Note that a source
                                  indication of 0 (unspecified) or 2 (pager)
                                  are always obeyed.
           TRANSSZ                Adjusts size on transient windows that are
                                  too small using dialog_ratio (see
                                  CONFIGURATION FILES).
           WS[n]                  Force a new window to appear on workspace n.
                                  Specify -1 to put the window into free mode
                                  so that it is mapped independent of
                                  workspaces and regions.
           XTERM_FONTADJ          Adjust xterm(1) fonts when resizing.  Note
                                  that this requires the xterm_fontadj spawn
                                  flag to be set on the autorun/program entry
                                  when the program is spawned.  See the
                                  spawn_flags option for information on how to
                                  enable it.

     Custom quirks in the configuration file are specified as follows:

           quirk[class[:instance[:name[:type]]]] {=|+=|-=} quirk [+ quirk ...]

     class, instance (optional), name (optional), and type (optional) are used
     to determine which window(s) the quirk(s) apply to.  class and instance
     are regex search patterns for the respective fields of the WM_CLASS
     window property.  name is a regex search pattern for the window name
     (WM_NAME/_NET_WM_NAME.)  type is a comma-separated list of zero or more
     of the following window types (_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE): desktop, dock,
     toolbar, menu, utility, splash, dialog, dropdown_menu, popup_menu,
     tooltip, notification, combo, dnd, and normal.  Leave this field blank to
     match any window type.  quirk is one of the quirks from the list above.

     When a window is managed, quirk entries are applied in the order
     specified in the configuration file.  The assignment operator determines
     how the quirks are applied.  When assigning quirks with ‘=’, quirks are
     replaced on matching windows.  To add or remove quirks, assign them with
     ‘+=’ or ‘-=’ instead.

     Note that patterns are interpreted as POSIX Extended Regular Expressions.
     Any ':', '[' or ']' must be escaped with '\'.  See regex(7) for more
     information on POSIX Extended Regular Expressions.

     For example:

           quirk[MPlayer] = FLOAT + FULLSCREEN + FOCUSPREV # Float all windows having a class of 'MPlayer'
           quirk[.*] = FLOAT # Float all windows by default.
           quirk[.*:.*:.*] = FLOAT # Same as above.
           quirk[firefox:Navigator] = FLOAT # Float all Firefox browser windows.
           quirk[::Console] = FLOAT # Float windows with WM_CLASS not set and a window name of 'Console'.
           quirk[\[0-9\].*:.*:\[\[\:alnum\:\]\]*] = FLOAT # Float windows with WM_CLASS class beginning with a number, any WM_CLASS instance and a _NET_WM_NAME/WM_NAME either blank or containing alphanumeric characters without spaces.
           quirk[pcb:pcb] = NONE # Remove the default quirk entry.
           quirk[.*:ws10] += WS[10] # Force windows with a WM_CLASS name of 'ws10' to workspace 10 without removing existing quirks.
           quirk[.*:.*:.*:splash,dialog] = FLOAT + ANYWHERE # Override default quirk entry.

     You can obtain class, instance and name by running xprop(1) and then
     clicking on the desired window.  In the following example the main window
     of Firefox was clicked:

           $ xprop | grep -E "^(WM_CLASS|_NET_WM_NAME|WM_NAME)"
           WM_CLASS(STRING) = "Navigator", "Firefox"
           WM_NAME(STRING) = "spectrwm - ConformalOpenSource"
           _NET_WM_NAME(UTF8_STRING) = "spectrwm - ConformalOpenSource"

     Note that xprop(1) displays WM_CLASS as:

           WM_CLASS(STRING) = "<instance>", "<class>"

     In the example above the quirk entry would be:

           quirk[Firefox:Navigator] = FLOAT

     spectrwm also automatically assigns quirks to windows based on the value
     of the window's _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE property as follows:

           _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_TOOLBAR          FLOAT + ANYWHERE
           _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_UTILITY          FLOAT + ANYWHERE
           _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_SPLASH           FLOAT
           _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DIALOG           FLOAT

     In all other cases, no automatic quirks are assigned to the window.
     Quirks specified in the configuration file override the automatic quirks.

EWMH
     spectrwm partially implements the Extended Window Manager Hints (EWMH)
     specification.  This enables controlling windows as well as spectrwm
     itself from external scripts and programs.  This is achieved by spectrwm
     responding to certain ClientMessage events.  From the terminal these
     events can be conveniently sent using tools such as wmctrl(1) and
     xdotool(1).  For the actual format of these ClientMessage events, see the
     EWMH specification.

     The id of the currently focused window is stored in the
     _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW property of the root window.  This can be used for
     example to retrieve the title of the currently active window with
     xprop(1) and grep(1):

           $ WINDOWID=`xprop -root _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW | grep -o "0x.*"`
           $ xprop -id $WINDOWID _NET_WM_NAME | grep -o "\".*\""

     A window can be focused by sending a _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW client message to
     the root window.  For example, using wmctrl(1) to send the message
     (assuming 0x4a0000b is the id of the window to be focused):

           $ wmctrl -i -a 0x4a0000b

     Windows can be closed by sending a _NET_CLOSE_WINDOW client message to
     the root window.  For example, using wmctrl(1) to send the message
     (assuming 0x4a0000b is the id of the window to be closed):

           $ wmctrl -i -c 0x4a0000b

     Windows can be floated and un-floated by adding or removing the
     _NET_WM_STATE_ABOVE atom from the _NET_WM_STATE property of the window.
     This can be achieved by sending a _NET_WM_STATE client message to the
     root window.  For example, the following toggles the floating state of a
     window using wmctrl(1) to send the message (assuming 0x4a0000b is the id
     of the window to be floated or un-floated):

           $ wmctrl -i -r 0x4a0000b -b toggle,above

     Windows can also be iconified and un-iconified by substituting
     _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN for _NET_WM_STATE_ABOVE in the previous example:

           $ wmctrl -i -r 0x4a0000b -b toggle,hidden

     Floating windows can also be resized and moved by sending a
     _NET_MOVERESIZE_WINDOW client message to the root window.  For example,
     using wmctrl(1) to send the message (assuming 0x4a0000b is the id of the
     window to be resize/moved):

           $ wmctrl -i -r 0x4a0000b -e 0,100,50,640,480

     This moves the window to (100,50) and resizes it to 640x480.

     Note that if a window has been manually positioned via binding,
     _NET_MOVERESIZE_WINDOW requests are ignored unless the window has the
     ANYWHERE quirk, the workspace is in floating layout, or the window is
     workspace-free.  Requests are also ignored on maximized and fullscreen
     windows.

SWMHACK
     When spawning a program via an autorun or program entry without the
     nospawnws flag, spectrwm aims to place the program's windows (if any) in
     its spawn workspace.  To accomplish this "spawn-in-workspace" behavior,
     spectrwm must determine the intended spawn workspace when managing a new
     window.  Since it cannot be done with X11 alone, libswmhack.so is
     included to make this feature possible.

     When a program is spawned, spectrwm automatically sets LD_PRELOAD and
     _SWM_WS in the program's spawn environment to enable libswmhack.so when
     it is executed.  Note that LD_PRELOAD is the path to libswmhack.so and
     _SWM_WS is the spawn workspace for any windows created by the program.

     When running programs from terminals, scripts, etc, the inherited
     environment may need to be configured.  It is possible to override the
     spawn workspace by setting _SWM_WS to a different value.  Alternatively,
     _SWM_WS can be unset(1) or set to a blank value to disable "spawn-in-
     workspace" behavior.  Note that workspaces are counted from 0.  ‘-1’ can
     be specified to put windows into workspace-free mode.

     For example, to play a video with mpv(1) on workspace 10 without changing
     the spawn workspace in the environment:

           $ _SWM_WS=9 mpv video.mkv

     Play the video in free mode so that it remains mapped when switching
     workspaces.

           $ _SWM_WS=-1 mpv video.mkv

     Disable "spawn-in-workspace" in the environment so that new windows map
     on whichever workspace happens to be focused.

           $ unset _SWM_WS

     Change the environment to spawn programs in free mode.

           $ export _SWM_WS=-1

     When spawning a program that creates windows via a daemon, ensure the
     daemon is started with the correct LD_PRELOAD in its environment.

     For example, when starting urxvtd(1) via xinit(1), LD_PRELOAD must be
     specified.

           LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libswmhack.so.0.0 urxvtd -q -o -f

     Note that some operating systems may ignore LD_PRELOAD if certain
     conditions are not met.  It is advised to check the man page of ld.so.

     In situations where libswmhack.so cannot be used, it is possible to use a
     quirk to spawn a program in a specific workspace.

     e.g. launch an xterm(1) in workspace 2 on startup:

           quirk[XTerm:ws2] += WS[2]
           autorun = ws[2]:xterm -name ws2

     Launch a chromium(1) window in workspace 3 on startup:

           quirk[Chromium:chromium:ws3] += WS[3]
           autorun = ws[3]:chromium --window-name="ws3" --new-window

     If the "spawn-in-workspace" behavior is not desired, it is possible to
     disable it before programs are spawned by setting the nospawnws spawn
     flag on spawn entries via the spawn_flags option:

           # Make 'nospawnws' the default for any autorun/program entries that are
           # added/replaced below this line in the configuration file:
           spawn_flags = nospawnws
           program[pcmanfm] = pcmanfm -n  # 'nospawnws' is set
           autorun = ws[1]:firefox        # ws[1] is ignored since 'nospawnws' is set
           program[lock] = xlock          # the replaced default entry has 'nospawnws' set

           # Add 'nospawnws' to an existing entry:
           spawn_flags[term] += nospawnws

     Alternatively, the IGNORESPAWNWS and IGNOREPID quirks can be applied to
     windows:

           # Disable spawn-in-workspace on PCManFM windows:
           quirk[Pcmanfm] = IGNORESPAWNWS

           # Disable spawn-in-workspace on all windows, including those spawned via autorun:
           quirk[.*] += IGNORESPAWNWS + IGNOREPID

     Note that XCB programs that roll their own X11 requests (e.g. Chromium)
     are currently unsupported by libswmhack.so.
