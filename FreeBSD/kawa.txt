KAWA(1)                 FreeBSD General Commands Manual                KAWA(1)

NAME
       kawa - Scheme language implemented using on a Java VM

SYNOPSIS
       kawa [options]
       java kawa.repl [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the kawa package, a Scheme dialect
       written completely in the Java language.  Scheme forms are compiled
       into Java bytecodes for efficiency.

       Scheme is a high-level non-pure functional language in the Lisp family,
       with lexical scoping dynamically-types.  The Kawa dialect of Scheme
       contains hooks to access and control Java objects.

       Using the kawa script is equivalent to invoking an interpreter of the
       Java language on the kawa.repl class.

       This manual page is just a quick synopsis.  For more information, read
       the kawa manual - see below.


OPTIONS
       -e expression
              Evaluate the expression.

       -c expression
              Evaluate the expression, but does not cause the start-up file
              ~/.kawarc.scm to be read.

       -f filename
              Read and evaluate Scheme commands from the filename.

       -s     Enter an interactive read-evaluate-print command loop.

       -w     Enter an interactive read-evaluate-print in a new top-level
              window.

       -C filename
              Compile filename to one or more Java class files.  See the Kawa
              manual for details.

       If no options are specified, it is equivalent to -s.
       GNU readline(3) can normally be used to edit commands.


FILES
       /usr/bin/kawa
              The kawa executable, which starts a java interpreter.

       ~/.kawarc.scm
              Commands that are executed when kawa is started.
