NAME
       Chemistry::File::SMILES - SMILES linear notation parser/writer

SYNOPSYS
           #!/usr/bin/perl
           use Chemistry::File::SMILES;

           # parse a SMILES string
           my $s = 'C1CC1(=O)[O-]';
           my $mol = Chemistry::Mol->parse($s, format => 'smiles');

           # print a SMILES string
           print $mol->print(format => 'smiles');

           # print a unique (canonical) SMILES string
           print $mol->print(format => 'smiles', unique => 1);

           # parse a SMILES file
           my @mols = Chemistry::Mol->read("file.smi", format => 'smiles');

           # write a multiline SMILES file
           Chemistry::Mol->write("file.smi", mols => \@mols);

DESCRIPTION
       This module parses a SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry
       Specification) string. This is a File I/O driver for the PerlMol
       project.  <http://www.perlmol.org/>. It registers the 'smiles' format
       with Chemistry::Mol.

       This parser interprets anything after whitespace as the molecule's
       name; for example, when the following SMILES string is parsed,
       $mol->name will be set to "Methyl chloride":

           CCl  Methyl chloride

       The name is not included by default on output. However, if the "name"
       option is defined, the name will be included after the SMILES string,
       separated by a tab.

           print $mol->print(format => 'smiles', name => 1);

   Multiline SMILES and SMILES files
       A file or string can contain multiple molecules, one per line.

           CCl  Methyl chloride
           CO   Methanol

       Files with the extension '.smi' are assumed to have this format.

   Atom Mapping Numbers
       As an extension for reaction processing, SMILES strings may have atom
       mapping numbers, which are introduced after a colon in a bracketed
       atom. For example, [C:1]. The mapping number need not be unique. This
       module reads the mapping numbers and stores them as the name of the
       atom ($atom->name).

       On output, atom names are not included by default. See the "number" and
       "auto_number" options below for ways of including them.

       head1 OPTIONS

       The following options are supported in addition to the options
       mentioned for Chemistry::File, such as "mol_class", "format", and
       "fatal".

       aromatic
           On output, detect aromatic atoms and bonds by means of the
           Chemistry::Ring module, and represent the organic aromatic atoms
           with lowercase symbols.

       unique
           When used on output, canonicalize the structure if it hasn't been
           canonicalized already and generate a unique SMILES string. This
           option implies "aromatic".

       number
           For atoms that have a defined name, print the name as the "atom
           number". For example, if an ethanol molecule has the name "42" for
           the oxygen atom and the other atoms have undefined names, the
           output would be:

               CC[OH:42]

       auto_number
           When used on output, number all the atoms explicitly and
           sequentially. The output for ethanol would look something like
           this:

               [CH3:1][CH2:2][OH:3]

       name
           Include the molecule name on output, as described in the previous
           section.

       kekulize
           When used on input, assign single or double bond orders to
           "aromatic" or otherwise unspecified bonds (i.e., generate the
           Kekule structure). If false, the bond orders will remain single.
           This option is true by default. This uses "assign_bond_orders" from
           the Chemistry::Bond::Find module.

CAVEATS
       Stereochemistry is not supported! Stereochemical descriptors such as @,
       @@, /, and \ will be silently ignored on input, and will certainly not
       be produced on output.

       Reading branches that start before an atom, such as (OC)C, which should
       be equivalent to C(OC) and COC, according to some variants of the
       SMILES specification. Many other tools don't implement this rule
       either.

       The kekulize option works by increasing the bond orders of atoms that
       don't have their usual valences satisfied. This may cause problems if
       you have atoms with explicitly low hydrogen counts.
