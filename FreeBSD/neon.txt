NAME
       neon-config - script providing information about installed copy of neon
       library

SYNOPSIS
       neon-config [--prefix] [[--cflags] | [--libs] | [--la-file] |
                   [--support feature] | [--help] | [--version]]

DESCRIPTION
       The neon-config script provides information about an installed copy of
       the neon library. The --cflags and --libs options instruct how to
       compile and link an application against the library; the --version and
       --support options can help determine whether the library meets the
       applications requirements.

OPTIONS
       --cflags
           Print the flags which should be passed to the C compiler when
           compiling object files, when the object files use neon header
           files.

       --libs
           Print the flags which should be passed to the linker when linking
           an application which uses the neon library

       --la-file
           Print the location of the libtool library script, libneon.la, which
           can be used to link against neon by applications using libtool.

       --version
           Print the version of the library

       --prefix dir
           If dir is given; relocate output of --cflags and --libs as if neon
           was installed in given prefix directory. Otherwise, print the
           installation prefix of the library.

       --support feature
           The script exits with success if feature is supported by the
           library.

       --help
           Print help message; includes list of known features and whether
           they are supported or not.

EXAMPLE
       Below is a Makefile fragment which could be used to build an
       application against an installed neon library, when the neon-config
       script can be found in $PATH.

           CFLAGS = `neon-config --cflags`
           LIBS = `neon-config --libs`
           OBJECTS = myapp.o
           TARGET = myapp

           $(TARGET): $(OBJECTS)
                $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) -o $(TARGET) $(OBJECTS) $(LIBS)

           myapp.o: myapp.c
                $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c myapp.c -o myapp.o
