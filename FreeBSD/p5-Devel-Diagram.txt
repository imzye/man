NAME
       Devel::Diagram - Discover the classes of an arbitrary suite of Perl
       modules

SYNOPSIS
           use Devel::Diagram;

           # Discover classes of a package anchored by a single Perl module.
           #
           $diagram = new Devel::Diagram('CGI');

           # Discover classes of a package anchored by a collection of modules in a folder.
           #
           use Devel::Diagram;
           $diagram = new Devel::Diagram('HTML/');

           # Render the result in your desired format.
           #
           print $diagram->Render('UXF20');

           # Render the result, then transform it via XSL.
           #
           print $diagram->Render('UXF20', 'xsl:uxf20toHtml');

DESCRIPTION
       Devel::Diagram scans the given Perl modules attempting to discover the
       class structure.  It produces a hash table that can be converted to XML
       (or other formats) via Render().

       An XSL stylesheet is included that converts the XML class diagram into
       HTML.

       See "eg/Diagram.pl" for a full example of use.

METHODS
       The few methods you need to activate Devel::Diagram.

       new( $moduleSpecifications )

       Here you name the Perl module (or suite) you want to process.  Enter
       the string you would specify in a 'use' or 'require' statement for this
       module.

       You may enter as many module specifications as you like, separated by
       commas.

       Render( $renderType [, $transformType] )

       Renders the class diagram in the given format.  Currently the only
       format that is recognized is 'UXF20'.  These can be extended easily by
       creating a new "Devel::Diagram::Render::<yourName"> module.

       Render() optionally takes a second parameter specifying a
       transformation on the rendered format, presumably resulting in a new
       format. For instance,

           Render('UXF20', 'xsl:uxf20toHtml')

       renders the class diagram as UXF20, then runs it through the XSL
       transform named "uxf20toHtml.xsl".

       Render() expects to find the XSL stylesheet in the "xsl" folder of
       "Devel::Diagram".  You need "XML::XSLT::Wrapper" and an appropriate XSL
       transform engine to make this work.

       Any warnings or errors in the rendering process can be found by
       investigating $@ on return.

TODO
       These are some of the things I think can be done to extend
       Devel::Diagram.

       XMI format
           Currently "UXF" is the only XML format supported. "XMI" is another
           commonly used format (but more complex).

       Fancy HTML rendering
           Perhaps with Javascript and/or server side to assist in browsing
           the codebase.

       Class::Struct parsing
           Class::Struct is also used to code OO Perl. Need to recognize this
           structure in the codebase.  There are also several other modules
           for class creation.

       Parameters
           What are the parameters of the operations?

       Other parsing
           The is more than one way to do it. OO Perl can be implemented in
           many ways; Devel::Diagram recognizes a few of them.  CPAN is big,
           really big, so there are OO Perl techniques that Devel::Diagram
           will not recognize, yet.

       Other UML diagrams
           Collaboration, sequence, etc. (see "UML::Sequence").

       Devel::Diagram all modules of CPAN
           Anybody?
