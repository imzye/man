DESCRIPTION
       Cego is a relational database system available as opensource.  For more
       information, please look at www.lemke-it.com

       Before building and using the Cego DBD interface, you have to install
       the required Cego C+ library  ( plus friends ).

       Thanks to Matt Sergeant and his DBD implemenation for SQLite.  This
       code was used as a starting base and helped very much to implement this
       driver very quickly.

       See the README in the installation package for more information.
