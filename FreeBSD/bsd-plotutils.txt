GRAPH(1)                FreeBSD General Commands Manual               GRAPH(1)

NAME
     graph – draw a graph

SYNOPSIS
     graph [option] ...

DESCRIPTION
     graph with no options takes pairs of numbers from the standard input as
     abscissas and ordinates of a graph.  Successive points are connected by
     straight lines.  The graph is encoded on the standard output for display
     by the plot(1) filters.

     If the coordinates of a point are followed by a nonnumeric string, that
     string is printed as a label beginning on the point.  Labels may be
     surrounded with quotes "...", in which case they may be empty or contain
     blanks and numbers; labels never contain newlines.

     The following options are recognized, each as a separate argument.

     -a      Supply abscissas automatically (they are missing from the input);
             spacing is given by the next argument (default 1).  A second
             optional argument is the starting point for automatic abscissas
             (default 0 or lower limit given by -x).

     -b      Break (disconnect) the graph after each label in the input.

     -c      Character string given by next argument is default label for each
             point.

     -g      Next argument is grid style, 0 no grid, 1 frame with ticks, 2
             full grid (default).

     -l      Next argument is label for graph.

     -m      Next argument is mode (style) of connecting lines: 0
             disconnected, 1 connected (default).  Some devices give
             distinguishable line styles for other small integers.

     -d      Disconnected line style (alias for -m 0)

     -s      Save screen, don't erase before plotting. (it may not have an
             effect on some devices)

     -y      Similarly for y.

     -h      Next argument is fraction of space for height.

     -w      Similarly for width.

     -r      Next argument is fraction of space to move right before plotting.

     -u      Similarly to move up before plotting.

     -t      Transpose horizontal and vertical axes.  (Option

     -x      Transpose vertical axis.

     If a specified lower limit exceeds the upper limit, the axis is reversed.

HISTORY
     plot appeared in Version 6 AT&T Unix.

BUGS
     graph stores all points internally and drops those for which there isn't
     room.

     Segments that run out of bounds are dropped, not windowed.

     Logarithmic axes may not be reversed.
