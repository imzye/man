NAME
       IO::Prompt - Interactively prompt for user input

STATUS
       This module is no longer being maintained.

       Use the IO::Prompter module instead.

VERSION
       This document describes IO::Prompt version 0.997004

SYNOPSIS
           use IO::Prompt;
           while( prompt "next: " ) {
               print "You said '$_'\n";
           }

DESCRIPTION
       By default, this module exports a single function "prompt".  It prompts
       the user to enter some input, and returns an object that represents the
       user input.

       You may specify various flags to the function to affect its behaviour;
       most notably, it defaults to automatically "chomp" the input, unless
       the "-line" flag is specified.

       Two other functions are exported at request: "hand_print", which
       simulates hand-typing to the console; and "get_input", which is the
       lower-level function that actually prompts the user for a suitable
       input.

       Note that this is an interim re-release. A full release with better
       documentation will follow in the near future. Meanwhile, please consult
       the examples directory from this module's CPAN distribution to better
       understand how to make use of this module.

INTERFACE
   Arguments to "prompt"
       Any argument not of the following forms is treated as part of the text
       of the prompt itself.

        Flag   Long form      Arg          Effect
        ----   ---------      ---          ------
                              <str>        Use <str> as prompt

                              <filehandle> Prompt to specified filehandle

                              <hashref>    Flatten hash entries into argument list
                                           (useful for aggregating the options below)

        -p     -prompt        <str>        Specify prompt explicitly

        -s     -speed         <num>        Simulated typing speed (seconds/char)

        -e     -echo          <str>        What to echo for each char typed

        -nl    -newline       <str>        When a newline is typed, echo <str> instead

        -d     -default       <str>        What to return if only <return> pressed


        -r     -require       <hashref>    Each value of each entry must 'smartmatch'
                                           the input else corresponding key is printed
                                           as error message:
                                            - Subs must return true when passed input
                                            - Regexes must pattern match input
                                            - Strings must eq match input
                                            - Arrays are flattened & recursively matched
                                            - Hashes must return true for input as key

        -u     -until         <str|rgx>    Fail if input matches <str|regex>
               -fail_if

        -w     -while         <str|rgx>    Fail unless input matches <str|regex>
               -okay_if

        -m     -menu          <list|hash>  Show the data specified as a menu
                                           and allow one to be selected. Enter
                                           an <ESC> to back up one level.

        -1     -one_char                   Return immediately after first char typed

        -x     -escape                     Pressing <ESC> returns "\e" immediately

        -raw   -raw_input                  Return only the string that was input
                                           (turns off context-sensitive features)

        -c     -clear                      Clear screen before prompt
        -f     -clear_first                Clear screen before first prompt only

        -a     -argv                       Load @ARGV from input if @ARGV empty

        -l     -line                       Don't autochomp

        -t     -tty                        Prompt to terminal no matter what

        -y     -yes                        Return true if [yY] entered, false otherwise
        -yn    -yes_no                     Return true if [yY], false if [nN]
        -Y     -Yes                        Return true if 'Y' entered, false otherwise
        -YN    -Yes_No                     Return true if 'Y', false if 'N'

        -num   -number                     Accept only valid numbers as input
        -i     -integer                    Accept only valid integers as input

       Note that the underscores between words in flags like "-one_char" and
       "-yes_no" are optional.

       Flags can be "cuddled". For example:

            prompt("next: ", -tyn1s=>0.2)   # -tty, -yes, -no, -one_char, -speed=>0.2

   "Hand-written" printing via hand_print()
       The hand_print() subroutine takes a string and prints it out in the
       stop-and-start manner of hand-typed text.

   Low-level input retrieval via get_input()
       The get_input() subroutine is a low-level utility subroutine that takes
       an input filehandle, an output filehandle, a reference to a hash of
       options (as listed for prompt(), above) and a single prompt string. It
       prints the prompt and retreives the input. You almost certainly want to
       use prompt() instead.

DIAGNOSTICS
       "Can't write prompt to read-only $_"
           You specified a filehandle to which the prompt should be written,
           but that filehandle was not writeable. Did you pass the wrong
           filehandle, or open it in the wrong mode?

       "Missing argument for %s option"
           The flag you specified takes an argument, but you didn't provide
           that argument.

       "Unknown flag ($s) in prompt"
           The flag you specified wasn't one of those that prompt()
           understands. Did you misspell it, perhaps?

       "Argument to -require must be hash reference"
           The "-require" option takes a single argument that is a hash. You
           tried to pass it something else. Try a hash instead.

       "Cannot write to terminal: %s"
       "Cannot read from terminal: %s"
           prompt() attempted to access the terminal but couldn't. This may
           mean your environment has no "/dev/tty" available, in which case
           there isn't much you can do with this module. Sorry.

       "Can't open %s: %s"
           prompt() tried to read input via *ARGV from a file specified on the
           command-line, but the file couldn't be opened for the reason shown.
           This is usually either a permission problem, a non-existent file,
           or a mistyped filepath.

       "Argument to -menu must be hash or array reference"
           The "-menu" option requires an argument that is either an array:

               prompt -menu=>['yes', 'no', 'maybe'];

           or a hash:

               prompt -menu=>{yes=>1, no=>0, maybe=>0.5};

           or a hash of hashes (of hashes (of array))

       "Too many -menu items"
       "Too few -menu items"
           A menu can't have fewer than 1 or more than 26 items.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
       IO::Prompt requires no configuration files or environment variables.

DEPENDENCIES

       •   version

       •   IO::Handle

       •   Term::ReadKey

INCOMPATIBILITIES

FAQ
       This is a collection of things that might help.  Please send your
       questions that are not answered here to Damian Conway
       "<DCONWAY@cpan.org>"

   Can I use this module with ActivePerl on Windows?
       Up to now, the answer was 'No', but this has changed.

       You still cannot use ActivePerl, but if you use the Cygwin environment
       (http://sources.redhat.com), which brings its own perl, and have the
       latest IO::Tty (v0.05 or later) installed, it should work (feedback
       appreciated).

THANKS
       My deepest gratitude to Autrijus Tang and Brian Ingerson, who have
       taken care of this module for the past twelve months, while I was off
       trekking in the highlands of Perl 6. Now it's their turn for some
       mountain air, I'll be looking after this module again.
