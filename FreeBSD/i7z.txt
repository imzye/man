NAME
       i7z - A better i7 (and now i3, i5) reporting tool.

SYNOPSIS
       i7z [OPTION], [OPTION] is optional. i7z needs to be run in super user
       (root) mode.

DESCRIPTION
       i7z runs the i7z, ncurses based, program without any options. i7z will
       print out the C-states and temperature for i3, i5 and i7 based Core
       processors from Intel (including Nehalems, Sandy Bridge and Ivy
       Bridge).

OPTIONS
       -h, --help show the list of options available with the i7z tool.

       -w  [a|l],  --write  [a,l] Logging of the frequencies can be turned on
       with this options. Option "-w a" or "--write a" will append to the  log
       file. Option "-w l" or "--write l" will replace the log file.

       -l,  --logfile  [FILENAME] Change  the  log file name to the specified
       FILENAME. Default logging file is cpu_freq_log.txt (single  socket) or
       cpu_freq_log_dual%d.txt (dual socket, %d is either 0, 1).

       --socket0  [SOCKETNUM], --socket1 [SOCKETNUM] The tool can print
       information for about 2 sockets at once at the most. The top view  will
       be, by  default, of the first socket (controlled by --socket0) and the
       bottom view will be of the second socket (controlled by --socket1).
       Supply the appropriate value of 0 or 1 or more for SOCKETNUM (if there
       are more sockets on the machine) to show in the top and bottom view.

       --nogui Disable the GUI. Useful when the only need is logging.

Example
       To print for two sockets and also change the log file (log to
       /tmp/logfilei7z)

       i7z --socket0 0 --socket1 1 -logfile /tmp/logfilei7z -w l
