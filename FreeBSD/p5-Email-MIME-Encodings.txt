Email::MIME::Encodings(3)                  User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Email::MIME::Encodings - A unified interface to MIME encoding and
       decoding

VERSION
       version 1.317

SYNOPSIS
         use Email::MIME::Encodings;
         my $encoded = Email::MIME::Encodings::encode(base64 => $body);
         my $decoded = Email::MIME::Encodings::decode(base64 => $encoded);

       If a third argument is given, it is the encoding to which to fall back.
       If no valid codec can be found (considering both the first and third
       arguments) then an exception is raised.

DESCRIPTION
       This module simply wraps "MIME::Base64" and "MIME::QuotedPrint" so that
       you can throw the contents of a "Content-Transfer-Encoding" header at
       some text and have the right thing happen.

       "MIME::Base64", "MIME::QuotedPrint", "Email::MIME".

PERL VERSION
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It
       should work on any version of perl released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made
       that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version
       may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.
