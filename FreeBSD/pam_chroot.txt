PAM_CHROOT(8)           FreeBSD System Manager's Manual          PAM_CHROOT(8)

NAME
     pam_chroot – Chroot PAM module

SYNOPSIS
     [service-name] module-type control-flag pam_chroot [arguments]

DESCRIPTION
     The chroot service module for PAM chroots users into either a
     predetermined directory or one derived from their home directory.  If a
     user's home directory as specified in the passwd structure returned by
     getpwnam(3) contains the string “/./”, the portion of the directory name
     to the left of that string is used as the chroot directory, and the
     portion to the right will be the current working directory inside the
     chroot tree.  Otherwise, the directories specified by the dir and cwd
     options (see below) are used.

     also_root      Do not hold user ID 0 exempt from the chroot requirement.

     always         Report a failure if a chroot directory could not be
                    derived from the user's home directory, and the dir option
                    was not specified.

     cwd=directory  Specify the directory to chdir(2) into after a successful
                    chroot(2) call.

     dir=directory  Specify the chroot directory to use if one could not be
                    derived from the user's home directory.
