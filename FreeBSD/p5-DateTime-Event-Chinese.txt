NAME
       DateTime::Event::Chinese - DateTime Extension for Calculating Important
       Chinese Dates

SYNOPSIS
         use DateTime::Event::Chinese qw(:all);
         my $new_moon = chinese_new_years();

         my $dt0  = DateTime->new(...);
         my $next_new_year = $new_year->next($dt0);
         my $prev_new_year = $new_year->previous($dt0);

         my $dt1  = DateTime->new(...);
         my $dt2  = DateTime->new(...);
         my $span = DateTime::Span->new(start => $dt1, end => $dt2);

         my $set  = $new_year->intersection($span);
         my $iter = $set->iterator();

         while (my $dt = $iter->next) {
           print $dt->datetime, "\n";
         }

         my $new_year = chinese_new_year_for_sui($dt);
         my $new_year = chinese_new_year_for_gregorian_year($dt);
         my $new_year = chinese_new_year_after($dt);
         my $new_year = chinese_new_year_before($dt);

DESCRIPTION
       This modules implements the algorithm described in "Calendrical
       Calculations" to compute some important Chinese dates, such as date of
       new year and other holidays (Currently only new years can be
       calculated).

FUNCTIONS
   $set = chinese_new_years();
       Returns a DateTime::Set that generates Chinese new years.

   chinese_new_year_for_sui($dt)
       Returns the DateTime object representing the Chinese New Year for the
       "sui" (the period between two winter solstices) of the given date.

         my $dt = chinese_new_year_for_sui($dt0);

   chinese_new_year_for_greogrian_year($dt)
       Returns the DateTime object representing the Chinese New Year for the
       given gregorian year.

         my $dt = chinese_new_year_for_sui($dt0);

   chinese_new_year_after($dt)
       Returns a DateTime object representing the next Chinese New Year
       relative to the given datetime argument.

         my $next_new_year = chinese_new_year_after($dt0);

       This is the function that is internally used by new_year()->next().

   chinese_new_year_before($dt)
       Returns a DateTime object representing the previous Chinese New Year
       relative to the given datetime argument.

         my $prev_new_year = chinese_new_year_beore($dt0);

       This is the function that is internally used by new_year()->previous().
