NAME
       yahooquote - Get stock quotes from Yahoo!

SYNOPSIS
         yahooquote SAPG.F JARD.SI 0307.HK BII.L DIA INTC T BCE.TO \
                  CDL.NZ CTI.AX SCIL.SI TELMEXL.MX FTE.PA OLIV.MI  \
                  TEF.MC VOLVA.ST EBTP4.SA
         yahooquote --verbose T BCE.TO DTEGN.F

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE: As of November 2017, the script is no longer all that useful as
       Yahoo! decided to halt the API service it relies on.

       This script provides a simple example for the use of
       Finance::YahooQuote as well as a simple check means of downloading a
       quote, or checking a symbol.
