NAME
       bincimap-up - Authentication stub for Binc IMAP


SYNOPSIS
       bincimap-up [ options... ] -- <authenticator> bincimapd [mailboxpath]


DESCRIPTION
       For more information about Binc IMAP, see the bincimapd man pages.

       To configure this stub, use either command line arguments, config file
       entries, or a combination of both. A subset of the config file options
       is available as command line options.

       Note that command line arguments always override config file options.


OPTIONS
       -a, --allow-plain
              If set, allows plain text authentication in an unencrypted
              (SSL/TLS) IMAP session.


           --auth-penalty=<n>
              Server will sleep for <n> seconds if the client issues a
              username/password pair that fails to authenticate.


       -t, --auth-timeout=<n>
              When the server is in unauthenticated mode, and does not detect
              any client activity, it will wait <n> seconds before closing
              (t/o) the connection. <n> can not be less than 30 seconds.


       -f, --ca-file=<file>
              A file with one or more certificate authority certificates. It
              is used to help the client verify the SSL certificate.


       -P, --ca-path=<path>
              A path used by the underlying SSL support to search for files
              with certificate authorities.


       -l, --cipher-list=<ciphers>
              Sets the list of available SSL ciphers.


       -c, --conf=<file>
              Location of bincimap.conf file.


       -C, --create-inbox
              If set, server will create the default mailbox INBOX on first
              login if it does not exist.


       -C, --depot=[Maildir++|IMAPdir]
              Sets whether to use a Maildir++ or an IMAPdir depot. Default is
              Maildir++.


       -d, --disable-starttls
              Do not advertise the STARTTLS capability. Use this when running
              Binc IMAP in plain text over an already SSL encrypted tunnel.
              Default: no.


       -h, -?, --help
              Displays basic usage.


       -I, --ip-variable=<var>
              For logging, suggests an environment variable that contains the
              remote host IP address.


       -i, --idle-timeout=<n>
              When the server is in authenticated mode, and does not detect
              any client activity, it will wait <n> seconds before closing
              (t/o) the connection. <n> can not be less than 1800 seconds.


       -J, --jail-path=<path>
              Which path bincimap-up should chroot to after starting
              bincimapd.


       -K, --jail-user=<userid>
              Which user bincimap-up should become after starting bincimapd.


       -j, --jail-group=<groupid>
              Which user bincimap-up should become after starting bincimapd.


       -L, --logtype=[syslog|multilog]
              Which method Binc IMAP should use to log.  syslog means to
              connect to syslog.  multilog means to log to stderr(2).
              Typically used together with the multilog utility. For xinetd,
              use syslog.  For daemontools/supervise, use multilog. Default:
              syslog.


       -m, --mailbox-path=<path>
              Path to mailbox relative from user's home area. Typically
              Maildir for Maildir mailboxes, or the empty string "" if the
              home area is equivalent to the Maildir directory.


       -M, --mailbox-type=<type>
              Which type of mailbox should the server use? Currently only
              supports Maildir.


       -p, --pem-file=<file>
              The path to the SSL certificate file, in PEM format.


       -s, --ssl
              If set, Binc will go straight into SSL server mode. If this
              option is not passed, Binc will still advertise STARTTLS,
              allowing clients to switch to SSL on need. Use --ssl if running
              Binc on port 993.


       -S, --subscribe-mailboxes=<mailboxes>
              If present, server will automatically subscribe client to the
              given list of mailboxes on first login. Mailbox list is given as
              a comma separated list with the mailbox' full path, for example
              INBOX,INBOX.Sent-Mail,INBOX.Trash


       -b, --transfer-buffersize=<n>
              The server will buffer up to <n> bytes of data before sending it
              off to the client. A lower value will give smoother response
              from the server, but is a bad idea for clients with a big RTT
              (for example dial-ins). A high value gives better throughput,
              but a more bulky transfer.


       -T, --transfer-timeout=<n>
              The server writes data to the client in bulks. Each bulk gets
              <n> seconds to complete before the server times out.


       -u, --umask=<umask>
              Server will use this umask throughout session. Defaults to
              user's default umask.



       -V, --verify-peer
              If set, server will attempt to verify peer certificate.


       -v, --version
              Shows Binc IMAP version.


       --     Marks the end of options to bincimap-up.  After this comes the
              checkpassword compatible authenticator.


       (trailing arguments)
              Binc IMAP's authenticator. The first argument is invoked as an
              authenticator subprocess of Binc, with the rest of the arguments
              passed as the authenticator's local arguments.


EXAMPLE INVOCATION
       The following example shows how to invoke Binc IMAP using multilog,
       with an example /opt location for the conf file and using checkpassword
       as the authenticator. Notice that both the authentication stub and the
       authenticated daemon must both have command line arguments, and that
       the authenticator comes after '--'.

       Also notice that after bincimapd comes the mailbox path. This is
       already set in bincimap.conf, so it's not necessary here, but shown
       only for the sake of demonstration.

              /opt/bincimap/bin/bincimap-up                        \
                   --conf=/opt/bincimap/etc/bincimap.conf          \
                   --                                              \
                   /bin/checkpassword                              \
                   /opt/bincimap/bin/bincimapd Maildir

       You will typically invoke bincimapd from either xinetd or supervise.


FILES
       All Binc IMAP's configuration files use the same Binc::Storage format.
       It's basically a sequence of named sections enclosed in {braces}, each
       containing a set of comma separated key=value pairs. The keys must be
       alphanumeric, and the values can contain any character if it's quoted.


       .I bincimap.conf
              Global configurations file. All entries in this file can be
              overrun with command line arguments.
