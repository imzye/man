NAME
       Catalyst::Model::CDBI::Plain - A Plain base class for Class::DBI models

SYNOPSIS
           # set up your CDBI classes within Catalyst: base class
           package Music::Model::DBI;
           use base 'Catalyst::Model::CDBI::Plain';
           __PACKAGE__->connection('dbi:mysql:music', 'user', 'pw');

           # One class, inherits from base, sets up relationships
           package Music::Model::Artist;
           use base 'Music::Model::DBI';
           __PACKAGE__->table('artist');
           __PACKAGE__->columns(All => qw/artistid name/);
           __PACKAGE__->has_many(cds => 'Music::Model::CD');

           # etc.

           # OR

           # use existing CDBI classes within Catalyst:
           package MyApp::Model::Artist; # a Catalyst class
           use base qw[Catalyst::Model::CDBI::Plain Some::Other::Artist];
           1; # That's it--Some::Other::Artist is in Catalyst as MyApp::Model::Artist

           # OR

           package MyApp::Model::Library;
           use base qw[MyApp::Model::DBI Class::DBI::mysql]; # add MySQL-specific methods
           __PACKAGE__->set_up_table('library'); # from CDBI::mysql

DESCRIPTION
       "Catalyst::Model::CDBI::Plain" is a Model class for Catalyst to be used
       with user-specified Class::DBI classes. It does not automatically set
       anything up or create relationships; this is left to the user. This
       module can be used with existing "Class::DBI" classes, so that they can
       be used with Catalyst, or as a way of writing CDBI-based Model classes
       within Catalyst.

   METHODS
       new Overrides the constructor to create a Catalyst::Base object, rather
           than a CDBI object.
