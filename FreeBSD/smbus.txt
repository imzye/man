SMBUS(4)               FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual               SMBUS(4)

NAME
     smbus – System Management Bus

SYNOPSIS
     device smbus

     device iicsmb
     device bktr

DESCRIPTION
     The smbus system provides a uniform, modular and architecture-independent
     system for the implementation of drivers to control various SMB devices
     and to utilize different SMB controllers (I2C, PIIX4, Brooktree848,
     vm86...).

System Management Bus
     The System Management Bus is a two-wire interface through which simple
     power-related chips can communicate with rest of the system.  It uses I2C
     as its backbone (see iicbus(4)).

     A system using SMB passes messages to and from devices instead of
     tripping individual control lines.

     With the SMBus, a device can provide manufacturer information, tell the
     system what its model/part number is, save its state for a suspend event,
     report different types of errors, accept control parameters, and return
     its status.

     The SMBus may share the same host device and physical bus as ACCESS bus
     components provided that an appropriate electrical bridge is provided
     between the internal SMB devices and external ACCESS bus devices.
