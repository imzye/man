CTFCONVERT(1)           FreeBSD General Commands Manual          CTFCONVERT(1)

NAME
     ctfconvert – convert debug data to CTF data

SYNOPSIS
     ctfconvert [-gis] -l label -L labelenv [-o outfile] object_file

DESCRIPTION
     The ctfconvert utility converts debug information from a binary file to
     CTF data and replaces the debug section of that file with a CTF section
     called SUNW_ctf.  This new section is added to the input file, unless the
     -o option is present.  You can also opt to keep the original debugging
     section with the -g option.

     The following options are available:

     -l label
             Sets the label as label.

     -L labelenv
             Instructs ctfconvert to read the label from the environment
             variable labelenv.

     -g      Don't delete the original debugging section.

     -i      Ignore object files built from other languages than C.

     -s      Use the .dynsym ELF section instead of the .symtab ELF section.

     -o outfile
             Write the output to file in outfile.

EXIT STATUS
     The ctfconvert utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
