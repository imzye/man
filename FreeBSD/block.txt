NAME
       bed - maze editor for block

SYNOPSIS
       bed [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       Use bed to create new mazes for block, or to edit an existing maze.

       Upon starting bed, you are presented with the level you are editing, in
       a full-screen editor. Use the arrow keys to move around, and press any
       of the .@#V^<>{}!⎪:=- characters, to edit the level. ("{" marks the
       starting position, "}" marks the end position, and the other characters
       correspond the the characters used in block.) Use the space bar to
       clear an individual cell.

       Press 'w' to write the level to a file, '?' for help, and 'q' to quit.

NOTES
       It is a good idea to restrict file names to 20 chars.

       The editor tries to fill the entire screen so if you write a level on a
       big screen, you will not be able to play it on a small one.
