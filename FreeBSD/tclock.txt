TCLOCK(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              TCLOCK(1)

NAME
       tclock - display time of day

SYNOPSIS
       tclock [-option ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Tclock displays an analog clock with a transparent face.

OPTIONS
       -background background-color
               specify the color of the interior of the clock

       -bg background-color
               same as -background

       -border border-color
               specify the color of the clock border

       -borderWidth border-width
               specify the thickness of the border - this is used as the line-
               width attribute of a graphics context, so a border width of
               zero still results in a thin border.  If you want no border at
               all, make the border color the same as the background color.

       -display display-name
               specify the name of the display to use

       -geometry clock-geometry
               specify the geometry of the clock.  Note that the size
               specification of this string will be ignored; see the -scale
               option for changing the size of the clock.

       -scale clock-size
               specify the size of the clock as a scale of the normal size.
               For example, -scale 0.5 results in a clock half the size of the
               default (in width and height - one-fourth the size in area),
               and -scale 2.5 results in a clock two and one-half times
               larger.

       -tickradius tick-distance
               specify the distance of each tick from the center of the clock.
               Specifying zero results in no tick marks.  Note that this is
               adjusted by the -scale option.

       -ticksize tick-size
               specify the radius of each tick mark.  Note that this is
               adjusted by the -scale option; however, ticks do not seem to
               scale well, so if you regularly start up the clock at a
               specific scaling amount, you may wish to fine-tune this
               parameter for best results.

       -width border-width
               same as -borderWidth

       -xrm miscellaneous-resource
               specify a resource for which no command-line option exists.
               This is most often used to disable the second hand by
               specifying -xrm "Tclock.Second.Tip.Radius: 0".

RESOURCES
       The resources equivalent to command-line options are

              Tclock.geometry
              Tclock.scale
              Tclock.border
              Tclock.background
              Tclock.borderWidth
              Tclock.tick.radius
              Tclock.tick.size

       In addition, each hand of the clock is made up of four points.  You may
       specify the position of each of these four points for each hand.  The
       hand specifications are {hour, minute, second}, and the point
       specifications are {tip, right, middle, left}.  Each point has two
       resources:

              Tclock.hand.point.radius
              Tclock.hand.point.offset

       The radius specifies the distance in pixels of that points from the
       center of the clock.  The offset specifies the angle of that point as
       an offset in minutes (sixtieths of a circle) from the "true" position
       of the hand.  Specifying a radius of zero for the tip of a hand
       disables that hand.

       Note that after you have fine-tuned the shapes of the hands, you can
       simply use the -scale option (or the .scale resource) to get any size
       clock with hands of that shape, without needing to adjust the radii of
       all those points.
