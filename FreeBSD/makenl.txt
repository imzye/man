MAKENL(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              MAKENL(1)

NAME
       makenl - Fido/FTN nodelist processing program.

SYNOPSIS
       makenl [<configfile>][-p|-t][-m[=<nodelist>]][-n=<netname>][-d]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page briefly documents the makenl command.

       makenl is a program that is used to process Fido/FTN nodelists for
       submission to coordinators and/or for creation of nodelist files for
       distribution. It is a near drop-in replacement for an existing
       installation of MakeNL.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       -p, -process
              Operate in Process mode, overriding Process statement in
              makenl.ctl.

       -t, -test
              Operate in Test mode even on the normal process day.

       -m, -merge
              Merge your updated nodelist segment with an existing
              distribution nodelist to produce a temporary nodelist containing
              your updates.

       -n, -name
              Specialized cosmetic switch. When you make a composite nodelist,
              the generated list begins, by default, with the line "Nodelist
              for ...". The -name switch may be used to insert a network name
              in front of the first word in that line. If the specified
              replacement name contains spaces, the entire parameter must be
              enclosed in quotes.

       -d, -debug
              Enable debugging output for some functions.

       -c, -credits
              Who made this program possible.

       -h     Show summary of options.

       The program is documented more fully in the files makenl.txt.gz,
       README.gz, & changelog.gz;  all in the /usr/share/doc/makenl directory.

FILES
       Examples of these files can be found in the
       /usr/share/doc/makenl/examples directory.

       makenl.ctl
              Standard name for the required makenl configuration file: it
              will look for this file in the current directory if the filename
              and path for it is not given on the command line.

       cpyright.txt
              Optional copyright notice for the nodelist file being created.

       epilog.txt
              Optional file containing text intended for the end of the
              nodelist file being created.
