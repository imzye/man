MAILER.CONF(5)            FreeBSD File Formats Manual           MAILER.CONF(5)

NAME
     mailer.conf – configuration file for mailwrapper(8)

DESCRIPTION
     The file /etc/mail/mailer.conf contains a series of lines of the form

     name program [arguments ...]

     The first word of each line is the name of a program invoking
     mailwrapper(8).  (For example, on a typical system /usr/sbin/sendmail
     would be a symbolic link to mailwrapper(8), as would newaliases(1) and
     mailq(1).  Thus, name might be “sendmail” or “newaliases” etc.)

     The second word of each line is the name of the program to actually
     execute when the first name is invoked.

     The further arguments, if any, are passed to the program, followed by the
     arguments mailwrapper(8) was called with.

     The file may also contain comment lines, denoted by a ‘#’ mark in the
     first column of any line.

FILES
     /etc/mail/mailer.conf

EXAMPLES
     This example shows how to set up mailer.conf to invoke the traditional
     sendmail(8) program:

           # Execute the "real" sendmail program located in
           # /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
           sendmail        /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
           mailq           /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail
           newaliases      /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail

     Using Postfix (from ports) to replace sendmail(8):

           # Emulate sendmail using postfix
           sendmail        /usr/local/sbin/sendmail
           mailq           /usr/local/sbin/sendmail
           newaliases      /usr/local/sbin/sendmail

     Using Exim (from ports) to replace sendmail(8):

           # Emulate sendmail using exim
           sendmail        /usr/local/sbin/exim
           mailq           /usr/local/sbin/exim -bp
           newaliases      /usr/bin/true
           rmail           /usr/local/sbin/exim -i -oee

     Using mini_sendmail (from ports) to replace sendmail(8):

           # Send outgoing mail to a smart relay using mini_sendmail
           sendmail        /usr/local/bin/mini_sendmail -srelayhost

     Using dma(8) to replace sendmail(8):

           # Execute dma instead of sendmail
           sendmail        /usr/libexec/dma
           mailq           /usr/libexec/dma
           newaliases      /usr/libexec/dma
           rmail           /usr/libexec/dma

BUGS
     The entire reason this program exists is a crock.  Instead, a command for
     how to submit mail should be standardized, and all the "behave
     differently if invoked with a different name" behavior of things like
     mailq(1) should go away.
