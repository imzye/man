libao.conf(5)                 libao configuration                libao.conf(5)



NAME
       libao.conf - configuration for libao.


SYNOPSIS
       /usr/local/etc/libao.conf

       ~/.libao


DESCRIPTION
       libao.conf and .libao are configuration files for libao, the audio
       output library.  They specify various options to libao, as described
       below.  libao.conf sets system-wide options, whereas ~/.libao sets
       user-specific options.  When an option is set in both places, the
       option in ~/.libao takes precedence.


FILE FORMAT
       The file consists of comments and key-value pairs.  Comments are on
       separate lines that start with a # symbol.  The key-value pairs are of
       the form:
              key=value
       where key contains no whitespace and no equal signs.  value will be all
       of the text after the equal sign until (but not including) the ending
       newline.  Beware of extra spaces at the end of the line!  They will
       probably be interpreted as part of the option value.

       The following is a list of valid global option keys. Any driver
       specific option may be used as well as those keys.

              default_driver
                     The short name of the driver libao should use by default.
                     Valid values include (not all are available on every
                     platform): oss, esd, arts, alsa, nas, irix, sun, roar and
                     sndio.  Note that "sun" is used on many BSD systems as
                     well as Solaris.

              debug (Value optional/ignored)
                     Sets all the drivers as well as AO itself into debugging
                     output mode.  Unlike passing the debug option to a
                     driver, debug will also print debugging information from
                     driver loading and testing.

              quiet (Value optional/ignored)
                     Sets all the drivers as well as AO itself into silent
                     mode.  Errors will return only error codes; neither ao
                     nor the drivers will print any output whatsoever to
                     stderr.

              verbose (Value optional/ignored)
                     Sets all the drivers as well as AO itself into verbose
                     mode.


EXAMPLE
       Here is an example libao.conf that forces the OSS driver to be used by
       default:

           # This is a comment.
           default_driver=oss


BUGS
       libao.conf is missing a number of potentially useful options.
