NAME
       XML::Catalog - Resolve public identifiers and remap system identifiers

SYNOPSIS
         use XML::Catalog;
         my $catalog=XML::Catalog->new('/xml/catalog.cat');
         $catalog->add('http://www.w3.org/xcatalog/mastercat.xml');
         my $sysid=$catalog->resolve_public('-//John Cowan//LOC Diacritics');
         my $newsysid=$catalog->remap_system('http://www.w3.org');
         $parser->setHandlers(ExternEnt=>$catalog->get_handler($parser));

   Oasis Example
         $ perl -e 'use XML::Catalog; \
         $pubid = q|-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.5//EN|; \
         my $catalog=XML::Catalog->new("/etc/xml/catalog"); \
         print $catalog->resolve_public($pubid), "\n";'

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements draft 0.4 of John Cowan's XML Catalog (formerly
       known as XCatalog) proposal
       (<http://www.ccil.org/~cowan/XML/XCatalog.html>).  Catalogs may be
       written in either SOCAT or XML syntax (see the proposal for syntax
       details); XML::Catalog will assume SOCAT syntax if the catalog is not
       in well-formed XML syntax.

       This module, as of 1.0.0, also supports Oasis XML catalogs.

CONSTRUCTOR
       new(URL [,URL]*)
           Read the catalog identified by URL and return a catalog object
           implementing it.  If more than one URL is given, chain the
           additional catalogs as extensions to the catalog (they will be
           searched before catalogs specified by EXTEND entries).

           All URLs must be absolute.  A URL with no protocol is treated as a
           filename.

METHODS
       add(URL [,URL]*)
           Chain the catalogs identified by the URL(s) to the current catalog.

       resolve_public(PUBID)
           Translate the public identifier PUBID to a system identifier.
           Returns undef if the identifier could not be translated.

       remap_system(SYSID)
           Remap the system identifier SYSID as specified by the catalog.
           Returns SYSID unchanged if no remapping was found.

       get_handler(PARSER)
           Returns a coderef to a resolver suitable for use as the ExternEnt
           handler for an XML::Parser object.  The resolver will first attempt
           to resolve a public identifier if supplied, and then attempt to
           remap the resulting system identifier (or the original system
           identifier if no public identifier was supplied).  It will then
           call the original ExternEnt handler associated with the parser
           object.  PARSER is the parser object; it is needed as an argument
           in order to obtain the original handler.

       build($url)
           create new catalog object

       fix_base($url)
           TBD

       parse
           TBD

       parse_SOCAT($ct)
           TBD

       parse_XML($ct)
           TBD

       set_base($href)
           TBD

BUGS / TODO
       Searching of chained catalogs is not purely depth-first (EXTEND items
       in a chained catalog will be searched before EXTEND items in the
       original catalog.

       Error checking leaves much to be desired.
