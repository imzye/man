NAME
       tv_augment - Augment XMLTV listings files with automatic and
       user-defined rules.

SYNOPSIS
       tv_augment [--rule <file>] [--config <file>]
                  [--input <file>] [--output <file>]
                  [--log <file>] [--nostats]
                  [--debug <level>]

       tv_augment [-r <file>] [-c <file>]
                  [-i <file>] [-o <file>]
                  [-l <file>] [-n]
                  [-d <level>]

DESCRIPTION
       Augment an XMLTV xml file by applying corrections ("fixups") to
       programmes matching defined criteria ("rules").

       Two types of rules are actioned: (i) automatic, (ii) user-defined.

       Automatic rules use pre-programmed input and output to modify the input
       programmes. E.g. removing a "title" where it is repeated in a "sub-
       title" (e.g. "Horizon" / "Horizon: Star Wars"), or trying to identify
       and extract series/episode numbers from the programme title, sub-title
       or description.

       User-defined rules use the content of a "rules" file which allows
       programmes matching certain user-defined criteria to be
       corrected/enhanced with the user data supplied (e.g. adding/changing
       categories for all episodes of "Horizon", or fixing misspellings in
       titles, etc.)

       (see "perldoc XMLTV::Augment" for more details)

       --input FILE read from FILE rather than standard input.

       --output FILE write to FILE rather than standard output.

       --rule FILE file containing the user-defined rules.

       --config FILE configuration file containing a list of which rules you
       want to run.

       --nostats do not print the summary log of actions performed, or list of
       suggested fixups.

       --log FILE output the stats to this FILE (default = augment.log).

       --debug LEVEL print debug info to STDERR (debug level > 3 is not likely
       to be of much use (it generates a lot of output))
