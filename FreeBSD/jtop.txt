NAME
     jps – Wrapper to top(1) that maps pids to jails

SYNOPSIS
     jps [<top options>] [lj] [long_jails] [ll] [long_lines] [b] [batch]
         [<delay in seconds>] [i] [install]

DESCRIPTION
     This a perl wrapper to top(1) that gets its output and maps pids to
     jails.

     The wrapper takes all top(1) options and passed then to the top(1) if
     some specified. When no options specified the wrapper uses default
     options.

     No additional software or tools like jailer(8) needed.

OPTIONS
     One or more of the following options to jps may be combined arbitrarily.

     <top options>  Options to be passed to top(1)
     lj             Use full jail hostnames
     long_jails     Same as lj
     ll             Do not cut long lines
     long_lines     Same as ll
     b              Print the top output just once
     batch          Same as b
     <delay in seconds>
                    Delay between screen redraws, default is 2 seconds
