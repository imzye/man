XISP(1)                 FreeBSD General Commands Manual                XISP(1)

NAME
       xisp - an X11/XForms based, user-friendly interface to pppd/chat, a
       simple ISP and phone company (PTT) database manager, and a dialup costs
       and usage logging/statistics tool.

SYNOPSIS
       xisp  [-bgcol #<6-digit hex color>] [-iconic]
             [-isp <ISP-num>] [-autodial] [-debug] [-expert]
             [-nohints] [-geometry [=][<W>{xX}<H>][{+-}<XO>{+-}<YO>]] [-pidfp
             <PID file name prefix>] [XForms parameters]

DESCRIPTION
       xisp implements a user-friendly interface to pppd/chat and provides
       maximum feedback from the dial-in and login phases on a browser screen,
       as well as a manual login terminal window. It also provides greater
       versatility in interrupting a call in progress and in general enhances
       the user's feeling of "what's going on", especially if she/he is not
       all that well acquainted with the intricacies of system log files.
       Furthermore, it incorporates a mechanism to log ISP connections and
       calculate/store phone-call costs. It's also much nicer to look at as
       compared to connection scripts writing output on the terminal :) The
       main application, xisp, relies on a special dialer, xispdial, which is
       spawned by pppd in order to perform the dialing, and a "bare bones"
       terminal interface, xispterm.

       The other facility provided by xisp is that of maintaining two small
       data bases, one for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and one for phone
       companies (PTTs). The implementation supports a variable number of
       records for both data bases. Each ISP entry, aside from user account
       name and password, has space for 8 telephone numbers, two dialing
       parameters determining number of dialing tries and inter-dialing delay,
       sixteen user customizable script lines for the chat program, and a
       wealth of dialing and pppd options to cover most communication needs.
       All ISP data base information is saved in the xisp resource control
       file .xisprc in the user's home directory. The phone company database
       supports all (known) PTT attributes applicable while logging phone-call
       costs, and saves its information in a separate file, in sub directory
       .xisplogs, in the user's home directory.

       For a brief presentation on the operation of xisp and in particular on
       the parameters available from within its "Options" and "Logging" menu
       options, invoke item "General" from within the "Help" menu. For a
       general discussion on the workings of xisp, its dialer xispdial and its
       helper terminal program xispterm, as well as their interaction with
       pppd and chat, see the "ARCHITECTURE" section in file README of the
       xisp distribution.

OPTIONS
       xisp accepts all of the standard XForms command line options along with
       the additional options listed below:

       -bgcol #<6-digit hex color>
               Enables changing the default background color for all program
               windows, and also the background color used by xispdial. The
               desired color is entered as a six-digit hexadecimal number, 2
               digits for each one of the three basic colors, red green and
               blue. Remember to escape the '#' character from the shell (e.g.
               "xisp -bgcol '#495563'" or "xisp -bgcol .TP 8 -iconic
               Instructs the window manager to start up xisp iconized.

       -isp <ISP-num>
               Selects the ISP entry specified by the number entered. Valid
               numbers range from 1 to the maximum number of ISP's supported
               (currently equal to 8).

       -autodial
               Immediately after startup, forces automatic dialing of the
               selected ISP entry. If the ISP selected already has automatic
               dialing upon startup enabled, then this option has no effect.

       -debug
               Switches on maximum PPP debugging, by increasing the pppd debug
               level and setting the kernel debugging option to 7, i.e. full
               debugging. It does that by instructing xisp to call pppd with
               the "debug kdebug 7" options added to its command line. Read
               the pppd(8) manual page for details on the types of debugging
               information written in the system log files.

       -expert
               Turns off all program confirmation dialogues. By default, all
               such dialogues are enabled. This option implies "-nohints".

       -nohints
               Turns off all popup hints. These contain valuable information
               for novice users and are enabled by default.

       -geometry [=][<W>{xX}<H>][{+-}<XO>{+-}<YO>]
               Instructs the window manager to adjust the size of the xisp
               window and to place it at the location specified. W denotes
               width, H height, XO x-offset and YO y-offset. The syntax for
               this geometry string is the standard one used by all X11
               applications.

       -pidfp <file name prefix>
               Specifies the file name prefix for pppd's PID file. This option
               is currently needed only for the PPP package distributed from
               Sun Microsystems for use with Solaris (derived from the
               ppp-2.4.0 release); in such case invoke xisp as: "xisp -pidfp
               sppp".

       The most commonly employed XForms command line options are also listed
       below for the user's convenience:

       -name <appname>
               Changes the application name. Useful for managing resources.

       -display <host:dpy>
               Specifies the display server. The default value is that
               contained in the $DISPLAY environment variable.

       -private
               Forces xisp to use a private colormap.

       -shared
               Forces xisp to use a shared colormap.

       -stdcmap
               Forces xisp to use the standard colormap.

SIGNALS
       The following signals have the specified effect when sent to the xisp
       process using the kill(1) command:

       SIGINT, SIGTERM
              The xisp process is terminated and the PPP link is disconnected.

       SIGUSR1
              If xisp is in the disconnected state, sending it this signal is
              equivalent to pressing the "Connect" button. If xisp is either
              dialing or in the connected state, this signal has no effect.

       SIGUSR2
              If xisp is dialing, sending it this signal is equivalent to
              pressing the "Interrupt" button, and if xisp is in the connected
              state, it is equivalent to pressing "Disconnect". If xisp is in
              the disconnected state, this signal has no effect.

       The xisp process id number is saved in file $HOME/.xisprc (see section
       FILES below).

FILES
       /usr/local/etc/ppp/options.xisp
              Special options file for pppd daemon version 2.2.x. It is not
              installed by default as of version 1.8 of xisp. It can be used
              to pass pppd any extra options not supported via xisp's GUI
              forms. This works with pppd version 2.2.x only.

       /etc/ppp/peers/xisp_dialer
              pppd 2.3.x peer information file used to set the path to
              xispdial, xisp's dedicated dialer application. Used by all
              /etc/ppp/peers/xisp_<device> peer files.

       /etc/ppp/peers/xisp_<device>
              pppd 2.3.x peer information file used for specifying the
              "noauth" option needed by most (if not all) ISPs, together with
              the serial device for which "noauth" holds. This is because
              setting "noauth" turns the modem device file specification into
              a privileged option. All such peer files contain a "call
              xisp_dialer" option, which reads in /etc/ppp/peers/xisp_dialer
              for setting the path to xispdial, xisp's dedicated dialer
              application.

       /usr/local/libexec/xispdial
              The special dialer program invoked by pppd as instructed by
              xisp. Employs chat(8) to converse with the modem and if manual
              login is selected, launches xispterm enabling the user to login
              manually.

       /usr/local/libexec/xispterm
              A "bare bones" terminal emulation program invoked by xispdial as
              a manual login terminal window.

       /usr/local/bin/xisprccv
              Utility program for converting .xisprc files of all older
              versions to the latest format. Understands database formats of
              version 1.2 and later.

       /usr/local/bin/xispid
              Utility program for retrieving the real group id of the calling
              process.  Adapted from the GNU id(1) utility for use with xisp.
              Used in ip-up and ip-down to screen users with permission to
              start pppd. For an example of its use read the sample ip-up and
              ip-down files included in the xisp distribution.

       $HOME/.xisprc

       $HOME/.xisprc.<hostname>
              Resource control file where xisp saves all its database
              information.  Plaintext passwords entered via xisp, are
              encrypted before being stored in this file. If
              .xisprc.<hostname> exists, it overrides the generic .xisprc
              file.

       $HOME/.xispscript
              Temporary file created by xisp and used by xispdial during the
              connection phase. This file contains the plaintext password if
              automatic login via the login script is selected, but is created
              u+rw,go-rw (mode 600) and remains on the filesystem only for
              that limited amount of time required for connection.

       $HOME/.xisppap
              Temporary file created by xisp and used by pppd, when PAP login
              is selected.  It contains the plaintext user account name and
              password, and is passed to pppd via the +ua command line option.
              It is created u+rw,go-rw (mode 600) and remains on the
              filesystem only for the short amount of time required for pppd
              to parse its command line and spawn a copy of itself in the
              background.  Chances are that unless you have a very heavily
              loaded system, you'll never be able to see this file in your
              home directory by using ls(1).

       $HOME/.xisplogs
              Directory under the user's home directory where the two log
              files and the phone company (PTT) ASCII data base updated by
              xisp are kept. It is created the first time xisp is run.

       $HOME/.xisplogs/xispcost.(period-suffix)

       $HOME/.xisplogs/xisplog.(period-suffix)
              The two log files kept by xisp when logging is enabled. The
              first one keeps track of the total on-line time (in seconds) and
              the total number of units charged (or total cost if the phone
              company selected charges by minute rather than in units). The
              second one contains entries for all ISP connections in the
              logging period selected (one for when the connection was set up
              and one for when it was torn down). The "period suffix" depends
              on the logging period selected. For "Weekly" logging it is
              ".W<week-number-in-year>", for "Monthly" it is simply the
              abbreviated month as returned by date(1), and for "Bimonthly" it
              is ".B<number-of-month-pair-in-year>". As an example, for date
              "Fri Sep 26 17:59:39 EET DST 1997", the corresponding suffixes
              are ".W39", ".Sep" and ".B5", respectively.

       $HOME/.xisplogs/xispPTTs
              The ASCII data base file where xisp saves all the phone company
              (PTT) information.

       $HOME/.xisp-up, $HOME/.xisp-down
              If either one of these scripts is present in the user's home
              directory, it is executed when the PPP link is setup or torn
              down respectively.  The script output can appear in the xisp
              browser window. Sample .xisp-up and .xisp-down scripts are
              included in the xisp distribution.

       /tmp/.xisppipe.<username>
              The named pipe node through which xispdial conveys messages to
              xisp. It is created u+rw,go-rw (mode 600) and is not deleted
              when the user exits xisp. The same node is also used for reading
              output from the ip-up, ip-down scripts (called by pppd) and
              .xisp-up, .xisp-down scripts (called by xisp), when a link is
              set up or torn down.

       $HOME/.xisppid
              This file contains the process id of the currently running xisp
              instance.  It can be used by scripts which control xisp via its
              signal handling capabilities (details in the SIGNALS section
              above). Note that if for some reason (e.g. full filesystem) xisp
              fails to create this file in the user's home directory, it will
              carry on without giving any indication of this problem.

NOTES
       When specifying the background color remember either to escape or to
       quote the leading '#'.

       deleting this paragraph and therefore removing this exemption for
       XForms.
