SYNOPSIS
     edquota [-uh] [-f fspath] [-p proto-username] username ...

             username ...

     edquota -g -e fspath[:bslim[:bhlim[:islim[:ihlim]]]] [-e ...]
             groupname ...
     edquota -t [-u] [-f fspath]
     edquota -t -g [-f fspath]

DESCRIPTION
     The edquota utility is a quota editor.  By default, or if the -u flag is
     specified, one or more users may be specified on the command line.  For
     each user a temporary file is created with an ASCII representation of the
     current disk quotas for that user.  The list of file systems with user
     quotas is determined from /etc/fstab.  An editor is invoked on the ASCII
     file.  The editor invoked is vi(1) unless the environment variable EDITOR
     specifies otherwise.

     The quotas may then be modified, new quotas added, etc.  Block quotas can
     be specified in bytes (B), kilobytes (K), megabytes (M), terabytes (T),
     petabytes (P), or exabytes (E).  If no units are specified, kilobytes are
     assumed.  Inode quotas can be specified in kiloinodes (K), megainodes
     (M), terainodes (T), petainodes (P), or exainodes (E).  If no units are
     specified, the number of inodes specified are used.  If the -h flag is
     specified, the editor will always display the block usage and limits in a
     more human readable format rather than displaying them in the historic
     kilobyte format.  Setting a quota to zero indicates that no quota should
     be imposed.  Setting a hard limit to one indicates that no allocations
     should be permitted.  Setting a soft limit to one with a hard limit of
     zero indicates that allocations should be permitted only on a temporary
     basis (see -t below).  The current usage information in the file is for
     informational purposes; only the hard and soft limits can be changed.

     On leaving the editor, edquota reads the temporary file and modifies the
     binary quota files to reflect the changes made.

     If the -p option is specified, edquota will duplicate the quotas of the
     prototypical user specified for each user specified.  This is the normal
     mechanism used to initialize quotas for groups of users.  If the user
     given to assign quotas to is a numerical uid range (e.g. 1000-2000), then
     edquota will duplicate the quotas of the prototypical user for each uid
     in the range specified.  This allows for easy setup of default quotas for
     a group of users.  The uids in question do not have to be currently
     assigned in /etc/passwd.

     If one or more -e fspath[:bslim[:bhlim[:islim[:ihlim]]]] options are
     specified, edquota will non-interactively set quotas defined by bslim,
     bhlim, islim, and ihlim on each particular file system referenced by
     fspath.  Here bslim is the soft limit on the number of blocks, bhlim is
     the hard limit on the number of blocks, islim is the soft limit on the
     number of files, and ihlim is the hard limit on the number of files.  If
     any of the bslim, bhlim, islim, and ihlim values is omitted, it is
     assumed to be zero, therefore indicating that no particular quota should
     be imposed.  Block quotas can be specified in bytes (B), kilobytes (K),
     megabytes (M), terabytes (T), petabytes (P), or exabytes (E).  If no
     units are specified, kilobytes are assumed.  Inode quotas can be
     specified in kiloinodes (K), megainodes (M), terainodes (T), petainodes
     (P), or exainodes (E).  If no units are specified, the number of inodes
     specified are used.

     If invoked with the -f option, edquota will read and modify quotas on the
     file system specified by fspath only.  The fspath argument may be either
     a special device or a file system mount point.  The primary purpose of
     this option is to set the scope for the -p option, which would overwrite
     quota records on every file system with quotas otherwise.

     If the -g flag is specified, edquota is invoked to edit the quotas of one
     or more groups specified on the command line.  The -p flag can be
     specified in conjunction with the -g flag to specify a prototypical group
     to be duplicated among the listed set of groups.  Similarly, -e flag can
     be specified in conjunction with the -g flag to non-interactively set-up
     quotas on the listed set of groups.

     Users are permitted to exceed their soft limits for a grace period that
     may be specified per file system.  Once the grace period has expired, the
     soft limit is enforced as a hard limit.  The default grace period for a
     file system is specified in <ufs/ufs/quota.h>.  The -t flag can be used
     to change the grace period.  By default, or when invoked with the -u
     flag, the grace period is set for all the file systems with user quotas
     specified in /etc/fstab.  When invoked with the -g flag the grace period
     is set for all the file systems with group quotas specified in
     /etc/fstab.  The grace period may be specified in days, hours, minutes,
     or seconds.  Setting a grace period to zero indicates that the default
     grace period should be imposed.  Setting a grace period to one second
     indicates that no grace period should be granted.  Quotas must be turned
     off for the file system and then turned back on for the new grace period
     to take effect.

     Only the super-user may edit quotas.

FILES
     quota.user   at the file system root with user quotas
     quota.group  at the file system root with group quotas
     /etc/fstab   to find file system names and locations

DIAGNOSTICS
     Various messages about inaccessible files; self-explanatory.
