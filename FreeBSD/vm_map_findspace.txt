VM_MAP_FINDSPACE(9)    FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual   VM_MAP_FINDSPACE(9)

NAME
     vm_map_findspace – find a free region within a map

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <vm/vm.h>
     #include <vm/vm_map.h>

     int
     vm_map_findspace(vm_map_t map, vm_offset_t start, vm_size_t length,
         vm_offset_t *addr);

DESCRIPTION
     The vm_map_findspace() function attempts to find a region with sufficient
     space in the map for an object of size length at the address addr.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
     It is the caller's responsibility to obtain a lock on the map using
     vm_map_lock(9) before calling this function.

     This routine may call pmap_growkernel(9) to grow the kernel's address
     space, if and only if the mapping is being made within the kernel address
     space, and if insufficient space remains in the kernel_map.

RETURN VALUES
     The vm_map_findspace() function returns the value 0 if successful, and
     *addr will contain the first virtual address in the found region;
     otherwise, the value 1 is returned.
