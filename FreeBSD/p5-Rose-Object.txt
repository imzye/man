NAME
       Rose::Class - A very simple class base class.

SYNOPSIS
           package MyClass;

           use Rose::Class;
           our @ISA = qw(Rose::Class);

           sub foo { ... }
           ...

           MyClass->foo(...) or die MyClass->error;
           ...

DESCRIPTION
       Rose::Class is a generic base class for classes.  It provides a single
       class method ("error"), but may be expanded further in the future.

       A class that inherits from Rose::Class is not expected to allow objects
       of that class to be instantiated, since the namespace for class and
       object methods is shared.  For example, it is common for
       Rose::Object-derived classes to have "error" methods, but this would
       conflict with the Rose::Class method of the same name.

CLASS METHODS
       error [ERROR]
           Get or set the class-wide error.  By convention, this should be a
           scalar that stringifies to an error message.  A simple scalar
           containing a string is the most commonly used value.
