lxqt-wayland-session(1)       LXQt Session Module      lxqt-wayland-session(1)

NAME
       lxqt-wayland-session - Wayland session for LXQt

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides the files needed for the Wayland session of the
       LXQt desktop environment and enables the Wayland settings page in lxqt-
       config-session.

FILES
       startlxqtwayland: Script which starts the compositor and sets the
       keyboard layout.

       Desktop entry file stating startlxqtwayland as binary needed to start
       LXQt Wayland sessions.  Sourced e. g. by display managers.

       Basic configuration files for supported compositors where needed:
       Hyprland, kwin_wayland, labwc, niri, river, sway, wayfire.

UNSUPPORTED COMPOSITORS
       Any compositor can be launched by startlxqtwayland but for starting and
       exiting the LXQt session a line lxqt-session &&
       <exit_compositor_command> has to be added to its autostart
       configuration.

NOTES
       Some lxqt-configuration tools currently do not support Wayland and
       those settings have to be configured in the compositor's configuration:

       * lxqt-globalkeys

       * lxqt-config-monitor (though kwin_wayland is mostly supported)

       * lxqt-config-input

       Limitations in lxqt-panel:

       * Workspace support in lxqt-panel's taskbar plugin is supported only in
       kwin_wayland.

       * Showdesktop plugin and  workspace switcher ar currently supported
       only in kwin_wayland.

       * kbindicator and qeyes plugin are currently not supported under
       Wayland.
