DESCRIPTION
       WordNet::QueryData provides a direct interface to the WordNet database
       files.  It requires the WordNet package
       (http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/).  It allows the user direct
       access to the full WordNet semantic lexicon.  All parts of speech are
       supported and access is generally very efficient because the index and
       morphical exclusion tables are loaded at initialization. The module can
       optionally be used to load the indexes into memory for extra-fast
       lookups.

USAGE
   LOCATING THE WORDNET DATABASE
       To use QueryData, you must tell it where your WordNet database is.
       There are two ways you can do this: 1) by setting the appropriate
       environment variables, or 2) by passing the location to QueryData when
       you invoke the "new" function.

       QueryData knows about two environment variables, WNHOME and
       WNSEARCHDIR.  If WNSEARCHDIR is set, QueryData looks for WordNet data
       files there.  Otherwise, QueryData looks for WordNet data files in
       WNHOME/dict (WNHOME\dict on a PC).  If WNHOME is not set, it defaults
       to "/usr/local/WordNet-3.0" on Unix and "C:\Program Files\WordNet\3.0"
       on a PC.  Normally, all you have to do is to set the WNHOME variable to
       the location where you unpacked your WordNet distribution.  The
       database files are normally unpacked to the "dict" subdirectory.

       You can also pass the location of the database files directly to
       QueryData.  To do this, pass the location to "new":

         my $wn = WordNet::QueryData->new("/usr/local/wordnet/dict");

       You can instead call the constructor with a hash of params, as in:

         my $wn = WordNet::QueryData->new(
             dir => "/usr/local/wordnet/dict",
             verbose => 0,
             noload => 1
         );

       When calling "new" in this fashion, two additional arguments are
       supported; "verbose" will output debugging information, and "noload"
       will cause the object to *not* load the indexes at startup.

   CACHING VERSUS NOLOAD
       The "noload" option results in data being retrieved using a dictionary
       lookup rather than caching the indexes in RAM.  This method yields an
       immediate startup time but *slightly* (though less than you might
       think) longer lookup time. For the curious, here are some profile data
       for each method on a duo core intel mac, averaged seconds over 10000
       iterations:

       Caching versus noload times in seconds

                                                 noload => 1  noload => 0
       ------------------------------------------------------------------
       new()                                     0.00001      2.55
       queryWord("descending")                   0.0009       0.0001
       querySense("sunset#n#1", "hype")          0.0007       0.0001
       validForms ("lay down#2")                 0.0004       0.0001

       Obviously the new() comparison is not very useful, because nothing is
       happening with the constructor in the case of noload => 1. Similarly,
       lookups with caching are basically just hash lookups, and therefore
       very fast. The lookup times for noload => 1 illustrate the tradeoff
       between caching at new() time and using dictionary lookups.

       Because of the lookup speed increase when noload => 0, many users will
       find it useful to set noload to 1 during development cycles, and to 0
       when RAM is less of a concern than speed. The bottom line is that
       noload => 1 saves you over 2 seconds of startup time, and costs you
       about 0.0005 seconds per lookup.

   QUERYING THE DATABASE
       There are two primary query functions, 'querySense' and 'queryWord'.
       querySense accesses semantic (sense to sense) relations; queryWord
       accesses lexical (word to word) relations.  The majority of relations
       are semantic.  Some relations, including "also see", antonym,
       pertainym, "participle of verb", and derived forms are lexical.  See
       the following WordNet documentation for additional information:

         http://wordnet.princeton.edu/man/wninput.5WN#sect3

       Both functions take as their first argument a query string that takes
       one of three types:

         (1) word (e.g. "dog")
         (2) word#pos (e.g. "house#n")
         (3) word#pos#sense (e.g. "ghostly#a#1")

       Types (1) or (2) passed to querySense or queryWord will return a list
       of possible query strings at the next level of specificity.  When type
       (3) is passed to querySense or queryWord, it requires a second
       argument, a relation.  Relations generally only work with one function
       or the other, though some relations can be either semantic or lexical;
       hence they may work for both functions.  Below is a list of known
       relations, grouped according to the function they're most likely to
       work with:

         queryWord
         ---------
         also - also see
         ants - antonyms
         deri - derived forms (nouns and verbs only)
         part - participle of verb (adjectives only)
         pert - pertainym (pertains to noun) (adjectives only)
         vgrp - verb group (verbs only)

         querySense
         ----------
         also - also see
         glos - word definition
         syns - synset words
         hype - hypernyms
         inst - instance of
         hypes - hypernyms and "instance of"
         hypo - hyponyms
         hasi - has instance
         hypos - hyponums and "has instance"
         mmem - member meronyms
         msub - substance meronyms
         mprt - part meronyms
         mero - all meronyms
         hmem - member holonyms
         hsub - substance holonyms
         hprt - part holonyms
         holo - all holonyms
         attr - attributes (?)
         sim  - similar to (adjectives only)
         enta - entailment (verbs only)
         caus - cause (verbs only)
         domn - domain - all
         dmnc - domain - category
         dmnu - domain - usage
         dmnr - domain - region
         domt - member of domain - all (nouns only)
         dmtc - member of domain - category (nouns only)
         dmtu - member of domain - usage (nouns only)
         dmtr - member of domain - region (nouns only)

       When called in this manner, querySense and queryWord will return a list
       of related words/senses.  Note that as of WordNet 2.1, many hypernyms
       have become "instance of" and many hyponyms have become "has instance."

       Note that querySense and queryWord use type (3) query strings in
       different ways.  A type (3) string passed to querySense specifies a
       synset.  A type (3) string passed to queryWord specifies a specific
       sense of a specific word.

   OTHER FUNCTIONS
       "validForms" accepts a type (1) or (2) query string.  It returns a list
       of all alternate forms (alternate spellings, conjugations,
       plural/singular forms, etc.).  The type (1) query returns alternates
       for all parts of speech (noun, verb, adjective, adverb).  WARNING: Only
       the first argument returned by validForms is certain to be valid (i.e.
       recognized by WordNet).  Remaining arguments may not be valid.

       "listAllWords" accepts a part of speech and returns the full list of
       words in the WordNet database for that part of speech.

       "level" accepts a type (3) query string and returns a distance (not
       necessarily the shortest or longest) to the root in the hypernym
       directed acyclic graph.

       "offset" accepts a type (3) query string and returns the binary offset
       of that sense's location in the corresponding data file.

       "tagSenseCnt" accepts a type (2) query string and returns the
       tagsense_cnt value for that lemma: "number of senses of lemma that are
       ranked according to their frequency of occurrence in semantic
       concordance texts."

       "lexname" accepts a type (3) query string and returns the lexname of
       the sense; see WordNet lexnames man page for more information.

       "frequency" accepts a type (3) query string and returns the frequency
       count of the sense from tagged text; see WordNet cntlist man page for
       more information.

       See test.pl for additional example usage.
