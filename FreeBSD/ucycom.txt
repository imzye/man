UCYCOM(4)              FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual              UCYCOM(4)

NAME
     ucycom – device driver for Cypress CY7C63743 and CY7C64013 USB to RS232
     bridges

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following line in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device usb
           device hid
           device ucom
           device ucycom

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           ucycom_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The ucycom driver provides support for the Cypress CY7C63743 and
     CY7C64013 bridge chips.  These chips were designed to provide a low-cost
     transition path to USB for existing RS232 devices, and have fairly
     limited capabilities.

     The ucycom driver behaves like a tty(4).

HARDWARE
     The ucycom driver currently supports the following devices which
     incorporate Cypress USB to RS232 bridge chips:

     •   DeLorme Earthmate USB GPS receiver
