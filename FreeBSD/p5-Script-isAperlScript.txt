Script::isAperlScript(3)                   User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Script::isAperlScript - This does a basic check if something is a perl
       script or not.

VERSION
       Version 1.0.0

SYNOPSIS
       This module does a basic check to see if something is a perl script.

       By default it checks for the paths below.

           /^\#\!\/usr\/bin\/perl/
           /^\#\!\/usr\/bin\/suidperl/
           /^\#\!\/usr\/local\/bin\/perl/
           /^\#\!\/usr\/local\/bin\/suidperl/

       This will also match stuff like "#!/usr/local/bin/perl5.8.9".

       If {env=>1} is given to the new method, the checks below are done.

           /^\#!\/usr\/bin\/env.*perl/

       If {any=>1} is given to the new method, the checks below are done.

           /^\#!\/.*perl/

METHODS
   new
       This initiates the object.

       args hash

       env

       Allow env based scripts.

       By default this is false as it can't be trusted.

       any

       This does very loose matching.

       By default this is false as it can't be trusted.

           my $checker=Script::isAperlScript->new( \%args );

   isAperlScript
       This checks if a file is a Perl script.

       Only one arguement is taken and it is the string in question.

       In regards to the returned value, see the section "RETURN" for more
       information.

           my $returned=isAperlScript($file);
           if(!$returned){
               print "It returned false so there for it is a perl script.\n";
           }

   stringIsAperlScript
       This checks if a string is a Perl script.

       Only one arguement is taken and it is the string in question.

       In regards to the returned value, see the section "RETURN" for more
       information.

           my $returned=stringIsAperlScript($string);
           if(!$returned){
               print "It returned false so there for it is a perl script.\n";
           }

ERROR CODES/FLAGS/HANDLING
       The easiest way to check is to verify the returned value is false.

       Error handling is provided by Error::Helper.

   2, noString
       The string is not defined.

   3, doesNotExist
       The file does not exist.

   4, notReadable
       The file is not readable.

   5, fileNotSpecified
       No file specified.

   6, noFile
       The file could not be opened.

   7, notAfile
       The specified file is not a file.
