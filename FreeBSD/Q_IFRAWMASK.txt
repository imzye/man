Q_IFRAWMASK(3)         FreeBSD Library Functions Manual         Q_IFRAWMASK(3)

NAME
     Q_IFRAWMASK, Q_IFVALIMASK, Q_IFVALFMASK, Q_GIFRAW, Q_GIFABSVAL, Q_GIFVAL,
     Q_SIFVAL, Q_SIFVALS – fixed-point math functions which manipulate the
     combined integer/fractional data bits

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/qmath.h>

     ITYPE
     Q_IFRAWMASK(QTYPE q);

     ITYPE
     Q_IFVALIMASK(QTYPE q);

     ITYPE
     Q_IFVALFMASK(QTYPE q);

     ITYPE
     Q_GIFRAW(QTYPE q);

     ITYPE
     Q_GIFABSVAL(QTYPE q);

     ITYPE
     Q_GIFVAL(QTYPE q);

     QTYPE
     Q_SIFVAL(QTYPE q, ITYPE ifv);

     QTYPE
     Q_SIFVALS(QTYPE q, ITYPE iv, ITYPE fv);

DESCRIPTION
     Q_IFRAWMASK() returns a q-specific bit mask for q's combined integer and
     fractional data bits.

     Q_IFVALIMASK() and Q_IFVALFMASK() return q-specific bit masks for the
     integer and fractional bits of q's combined integer and fractional data
     bits value, i.e., are applicable to the values returned by Q_GIFABSVAL()
     and Q_GIFVAL().

     Q_GIFRAW() returns q's raw masked integer/fractional data bits.

     Q_GIFABSVAL() and Q_GIFVAL() return the absolute and real values of q's
     integer/fractional data bits respectively.

     Q_SIFVAL() sets q's combined integer/fractional data bits to the value
     ifv, whereas Q_SIFVALS() independently sets q's integer and fractional
     data bits to the separate values iv and fv.

     All of those functions operate on the following data types: s8q_t, u8q_t,
     s16q_t, u16q_t, s32q_t, u32q_t, s64q_t, and u64q_t, which are referred to
     generically as QTYPE.  The ITYPE refers to the stdint(7) integer types.

     For more details, see qmath(3).

RETURN VALUES
     Q_IFRAWMASK(), Q_IFVALIMASK(), Q_IFVALFMASK(), Q_GIFABSVAL(), Q_GIFVAL(),
     Q_GIFRAW(), Q_GIFABSVAL() and Q_GIFVAL() return their respective values
     as integers of the same underlying ITYPE as q.

     Q_SIFVAL() and Q_SIFVALS() return the value of q post change.
