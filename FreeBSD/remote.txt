REMOTE(5)                 FreeBSD File Formats Manual                REMOTE(5)

NAME
     remote – remote host description file

DESCRIPTION
     The systems known by tip(1) and their attributes are stored in an ASCII
     file which is structured somewhat like the termcap(5) file.  Each line in
     the file provides a description for a single system.  Fields are
     separated by a colon (``:'').  Lines ending in a \ character with an
     immediately following newline are continued on the next line.

     The first entry is the name(s) of the host system.  If there is more than
     one name for a system, the names are separated by vertical bars.  After
     the name of the system comes the fields of the description.  A field name
     followed by an `=' sign indicates a string value.  A field name followed
     by a `#' sign indicates a numeric value.

     Entries named ``tip*'' and ``cu*'' are used as default entries by tip(1),
     and the cu(1) interface to tip, as follows.  When tip is invoked with
     only a phone number, it looks for an entry of the form ``tip300'', where
     300 is the data rate with which the connection is to be made.  When the
     cu interface is used, entries of the form ``cu300'' are used.

CAPABILITIES
     Capabilities are either strings (str), numbers (num), or boolean flags
     (bool).  A string capability is specified by capability=value; for
     example, ``dv=/dev/harris''.  A numeric capability is specified by
     capability#value; for example, ``xa#99''.  A boolean capability is
     specified by simply listing the capability.

     at      (str) Auto call unit type.

     br      (num) The data rate (bits per second) used for communications on
             the serial port.  When a modem is used, the data rate used to
             communicate with the remote modem may be different than this
             rate.  This is a decimal number.  The default rate is 9600 bits
             per second.

     cm      (str) An initial connection message to be sent to the remote
             host.  For example, if a host is reached through a port selector,
             this might be set to the appropriate sequence required to switch
             to the host.

     cu      (str) Call unit if making a phone call.  Default is the same as
             the `dv' field.

     di      (str) Disconnect message sent to the host when a disconnect is
             requested by the user.

     du      (bool) This host is on a dial-up line.

     dv      (str) UNIX device(s) to open to establish a connection.  If this
             file refers to a terminal line, tip(1) attempts to perform an
             exclusive open on the device to ensure only one user at a time
             has access to the port.

     el      (str) Characters marking an end-of-line.  The default is NULL.
             `~' escapes are only recognized by tip after one of the
             characters in `el', or after a carriage-return.

     fs      (str) Frame size for transfers.  The default frame size is equal
             to BUFSIZ.

     hd      (bool) The host uses half-duplex communication, local echo should
             be performed.

     ie      (str) Input end-of-file marks.  The default is NULL.

     oe      (str) Output end-of-file string.  The default is NULL.  When tip
             is transferring a file, this string is sent at end-of-file.

     pa      (str) The type of parity to use when sending data to the host.
             This may be one of ``even'', ``odd'', ``none'', ``zero'' (always
             set bit 8 to zero), ``one'' (always set bit 8 to 1).  The default
             is even parity.

     pn      (str) Telephone number(s) for this host.  If the telephone number
             field contains an @ sign, tip searches the file /etc/phones file
             for a list of telephone numbers (see phones(5)).

     tc      (str) Indicates that the list of capabilities is continued in the
             named description.  This is used primarily to share common
             capability information.

FILES
     /etc/remote  The remote host description file resides in /etc.

EXAMPLES
     Here is a short example showing the use of the capability continuation
     feature.  It defines a 56k modem connection on the first serial port at
     115200 bits per second, no parity using the Hayes command set with
     standard line editing and end of file characters.  The arpavax entry
     includes everything in the UNIX-57600 entry plus the phone number for
     arpavax (in this case an @ character so that it is retrieved from the
     environment).

     UNIX-57600:\
     :dv=/dev/cuau0:el=^D^U^C^S^Q^O@:oe=^D:du:at=hayes:br#115200:pa=none:
     arpavax|ax:\
     :pn=\@:tc=UNIX-57600

HISTORY
     The remote file format appeared in 4.2BSD.

BUGS
     The tip(1) utility uses its own notion of the serial ports data rate
     rather than the system default for a serial port.
