NAME
       parrot-nqp - Not Quite Perl (6)

SYNOPSIS
       parrot-nqp <file>

DESCRIPTION
       This is "Not Quite Perl (6)" -- a High Level Language (HLL) which
       allows one to write Perl6-like code. The key feature of NQP is that
       it's designed to be an easy-to-parse subset of Perl 6. It is geared
       towards being a high-level way to create transformers for Parrot
       (especially HLL compilers).  It is based on PCT::HLLCompiler.

       NQP is used as a bootstrapping language in for Rakudo, and hence
       developed outside of the main Parrot git repository. It is occasionally
       snapshotted into the main Parrot codebase so it can be bundled with
       Parrot releases and be used by core Parrot developers as well as HLL
       developers.
