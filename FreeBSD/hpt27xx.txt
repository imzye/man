NAME
     hpt27xx – HighPoint RocketRAID 27xx SAS 6Gb/s HBA card driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following line in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device hpt27xx

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           hpt27xx_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The hpt27xx driver provides support for HighPoint's RocketRAID 27xx based
     RAID controller.

     These devices support SAS disk drives and provide RAID0 (striping), RAID1
     (mirroring), and RAID5 functionality.

HARDWARE
     The hpt27xx driver supports the following SAS controllers:

     •   HighPoint's RocketRAID 271x series
     •   HighPoint's RocketRAID 272x series
     •   HighPoint's RocketRAID 274x series
     •   HighPoint's RocketRAID 276x series
     •   HighPoint's RocketRAID 278x series

NOTES
     The hpt27xx driver only works on the i386 and amd64 platforms as it
     requires a binary blob object from the manufacturer which they only
     supply for these platforms.  The hpt27xx driver does not work on i386
     with pae(4) enabled.
