CONFIG FILE
       You can place a config file named .foobillardrc in your home directory.
       The file can contain all possible commandline arguments (without the
       preceding dashes, and one line for each argument).  Commandline
       parameters are parsed after reading the config file, so they override
       the .foobillardrc settings.

NETWORK GAMES
       To start a network game :

       Hit <ESC> to get to the menu,

       Select <Network Game>/<As Host> on one computer and <Network
       Game>/<Join>/<OK> on the other machine after having set the proper IP
       in <Network Game>/<Join>/<IP>.

       The <Network Game>/<Port> setting must be the same on both machines.

       The IP of the host machine can also be set on the client machine (the
       joining one), by adding hostaddr=IP-ADDR in the config file (see
       below), or by passing it as commandline option: --hostaddr=IP-ADDR

       Starting from menu the host sends its gamestate variables to the
       client, so every clienside settings get overriden by the host
       (gametype, tablesize, player names, ...)

       The data sent between the two computers are only the shot-data, like
       strength, cue offset and direction. So if the two machines have a
       different internal floating point accuracy, the games may drift apart
       after a certain amount of time.
