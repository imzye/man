Bigtop(3)             User Contributed Perl Documentation            Bigtop(3)


NAME
       Bigtop - A web application data language processor

SYNOPSIS
       See Bigtop::Docs::TentTut or Bigtop::Docs::Tutorial for how to create a
       Bigtop file.  Bigtop::Docs::TOC is a guide to all of the documentation
       modules.

       The real synopsis (see Bigtop::ScriptHelp::Style::Kickstart):

           bigtop --new AppName 'stock<-lot
           stock(symbol,name)
           lot(bought:date,price:int4,shares:int4)'

       or go manual:

           vi your_app.bigtop (or use tentmaker see Bigtop::Docs::TentTut)
           bigtop --create your_app.bigtop all

       Then run your app (if you have sqlite in your path):

           cd AppName
           ./app.server

       Modify your bigtop file and try again:

           bigtop docs/your_app.bigtop all

DESCRIPTION
       Bigtop is a language for describing the data of a web application.
       Usually this data will be stored in a relational database.  Once you
       have a description of your data, you can generate a web application
       from it.  This includes all the pieces you need like: the sql
       statements ready for feeding to your database command line tool, the
       httpd.conf you need to Include in the httpd.conf on your system, the
       modules that will handle the web requests, the models that make the
       database tables look like classes, etc.

       If you need to alter the data model in the future, you can change your
       original description to match the new reality, then regenerate the
       application without fear of losing hand written code (though you may
       have to modify some of it to reflect the new reality).

FUNCTIONS
       This module is really a place holder, but it does provide some
       developer routines (which are not exported):

       write_file
               use Bigtop;
               Bigtop::write_file( $file_name, $file_content, $no_overwrite )

           This attempts to write $file_content to $file_name and dies on
           failures of open or close.  Further, if you pass a true
           no_overwrite flag, it will check to see if the file exists and
           refuse to overwrite it.  In that case, the user gets a warning that
           the file has been skipped because it already exists.  If you don't
           want the user to see the warning, turn off the Bigtop warning.  To
           avoid fatal errors on write failures, wrap in an eval.  Putting
           these together, we come to my typcial usage:

               eval {
                   no warnings qw( Bigtop );
                   Bigtop::write_file( $some_output_file, $content, 'no_overwrite' );
               }
               warn $@ if $@;

       make_module_path
           (Note that make_module_path uses File::Spec, so even though Unix
           directory syntax is shown below, the function should work in other
           places.)

               use Bigtop;
               Bigtop::make_module_path( $build_dir, $module_name );

           This attempts to make all the directories from $build_dir to the
           home of the module.  It assumes that lib comes immediately after
           $build_dir.

           For example, a call like:

               Bigtop::make_module_path(
                   '/home/username/App-Name', 'App::Name::Subname'
               );

           Attempts to make these directories:

               /home/username/App-Name/lib
               /home/username/App-Name/lib/App
               /home/username/App-Name/lib/App/Name
               /home/username/App-Name/lib/App/Name/Subname

           It doesn't report failures.  Making directories can fail because
           the directories already exist (in which case you probably don't
           care) or because they could not be written (in which case you'll
           notice soon enough, when you try to write to them).

   EXPORT
       None.

SEE ALSO

       If you are interested in Bigtop's inner workings, consider delving into
       some of these:

       •   Bigtop::Parser

       •   Bigtop::Keywords

       •   Bigtop::Backend::Init

       •   Bigtop::Backend::Init::Std

       •   Bigtop::Backend::SQL

       •   Bigtop::Backend::SQL::Postgres

       •   Bigtop::Backend::CGI

       •   Bigtop::Backend::CGI::Gantry

       •   Bigtop::Backend::Control

       •   Bigtop::Backend::Control::Gantry

       •   Bigtop::Backend::HttpdConf

       •   Bigtop::Backend::HttpdConf::Gantry

       •   Bigtop::Backend::Model

       •   Bigtop::Backend::Model::GantryDBIxClass

       •   Bigtop::Backend::SiteLook::GantryDefault

       The backends come in types.  Ideally, these types all share a set of
       keywords which are requested from Bigtop::Keywords in the type's
       module.  So Bigtop::Backend::SQL is meant to request the KEYWORDS that
       all Bigtop::SQL::* modules use.  They may request others, but only if
       they are specific to the generated target.  For example, there might be
       some Postgres specific keyword which doesn't apply to other databases.
       It should be requested in "Bigtop::Backend::SQL::Postgres".  Even if
       you need backend specific keywords, you should put them in
       "Bigtop::Keywords" so tentmaker can display them.
