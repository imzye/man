       ControlPanel - Configure desktop settings for FOX Toolkit applications

SYNOPSIS
       ControlPanel

DESCRIPTION
       The ControlPanel allows the user to change the color themes, fonts, and
       file bindings of FOX Toolkit based programs.


USAGE
       The ControlPanel has three tabs: Themes, Bindings, and General.

       The Themes tab is used to control color themes, individual colors, and
       the system font.

       The Bindings tab is used to associate file extension-associations with
       a description, command, and mime-type.  The user can also assign icons.

       The General tab is used to control some common parameters of FOX
       Toolkit programs, such as tooltip delay, mouse wheel speed, and so on.
