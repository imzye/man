NAME
       Text::Typography - Markup ASCII text with correct typography for HTML

SYNOPSIS
           use Text::Typography qw(typography);

           print typography($text);

DESCRIPTION
       This module is a thin wrapper for John Gruber's SmartyPants plugin for
       various CMSs.

       SmartyPants is a web publishing utility that translates plain ASCII
       punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML
       entities. SmartyPants can perform the following transformations:

       •   Straight quotes ( " and ' ) into "curly" quote HTML entities

       •   Backticks-style quotes (``like this'') into "curly" quote HTML
           entities

       •   Dashes ("--" and "---") into en- and em-dash entities

       •   Three consecutive dots ("...") into an ellipsis entity

       SmartyPants does not modify characters within "<pre>", "<code>",
       "<kbd>", "<script>", or "<math>" tag blocks.  Typically, these tags are
       used to display text where smart quotes and other "smart punctuation"
       would not be appropriate, such as source code or example markup.

   typography($text[, $attributes])
       Returns a string marked up with the proper HTML entities for proper
       typography.

       For fine grain control over what gets converted, use the $attributes
       option.  The default value is 3.

       The following numeric values set a group of options:

           0 : do nothing
           1 : set all
           2 : set all, using old school en- and em- dash shortcuts (-- and ---)
           3 : set all, using inverted old school en- and em- dash shortcuts (--- and --)

       For even finer control, specify a string of one or more of the
       following characters:

           q : quotes
           b : backtick quotes (``double'' only)
           B : backtick quotes (``double'' and `single')
           d : dashes
           D : old school dashes
           i : inverted old school dashes
           e : ellipses
           w : convert &quot; entities to " for Dreamweaver users

   Backslash Escapes
       If you need to use literal straight quotes (or plain hyphens and
       periods), SmartyPants accepts the following backslash escape sequences
       to force non-smart punctuation. It does so by transforming the escape
       sequence into a decimal-encoded HTML entity:

                     Escape  Value  Character
                     ------  -----  ---------
                       \\    &#92;    \
                       \"    &#34;    "
                       \'    &#39;    '
                       \.    &#46;    .
                       \-    &#45;    -
                       \`    &#96;    `

       This is useful, for example, when you want to use straight quotes as
       foot and inch marks: 6'2" tall; a 17" iMac.

   Algorithmic Shortcomings
       One situation in which quotes will get curled the wrong way is when
       apostrophes are used at the start of leading contractions. For example:

           'Twas the night before Christmas.

       In the case above, SmartyPants will turn the apostrophe into an opening
       single-quote, when in fact it should be a closing one. I don't think
       this problem can be solved in the general case -- every word processor
       I've tried gets this wrong as well. In such cases, it's best to use the
       proper HTML entity for closing single-quotes ("&#8217;") by hand.
