NAME
       crrcsim - a model-airplane flight simulation program

SYNOPSIS
       crrcsim [-fvhV] [-l landscape-file] [-c cdepth] [-x xres] [-y yres]
       [-d winddir] [-w windvel] [-g config-file] [-s on|off] [-u on|off]
       [-m AILERON|RUDDER] [-b nr:buttonfunc] [-i method] airplane-file

DESCRIPTION
       crrcsim is a model-airplane flight simulation program for Linux with
       ports to other platforms. Using crrcsim you can learn how to fly model
       aircraft, test new aircraft designs, and improve your skills by
       practicing in the relative safety of your PC.

OPTIONS
       -b nr:buttonfunc
              Bind a joystick button to a function.  nr is the number of the
              joystick button. For example, -b 2:INCTHROTTLE will increase the
              current throttle setting by 10% each time button #2 is pressed.
              See section BUTTON FUNCTIONS for a listing of all possible
              functions.

       -c cdepth
              Color-depth in bits-per-pixel

       -d winddir
              Wind direction in degrees.

       -f     Start in fullscreen mode.

       -g config-file
              Specify a config file.

       -h     Display help and exit.

       -i type
              Select input method.

       -l landscape-file
              Load the landscape defined by landscape-file

       -m AILERON|RUDDER
              Specify which function is controlled by horizontal mouse
              movement (if the input method is set to MOUSE).

       -s on|off
              Enable/disable sound (default: on).

       -u on|off
              Enable/disable graphical user interface (default: on).

       -v     Enable on-screen display of some values. This option may be
              specified up to three times.

       -V     Only print version information and exit.

       -w windvel
              Wind velocity in ft/s.

       -x xres
              Horizontal resolution in pixels.

       -y yres
              Vertical resolution in pixels.

BUTTON FUNCTIONS
       PAUSE  Pause the simulation.

       RESUME Resume the simulation from pause mode.

       RESET  Restart the simulation with the current configuration.

       ZOOMIN Increase the zoom factor of the current view.

       ZOOMOUT
              Decrease the zoom factor of the current view.

       INCTHROTTLE
              Increase the throttle by 10%.

       DECTHROTTLE
              Decrease the throttle by 10%.

INPUT METHODS
       KEYBOARD
              The airplane is controlled by the keyboard.

       MOUSE  Elevator and either aileron or rudder (depending on the -m
              option) are controlled by the mouse. Throttle can be adjusted by
              using the keyboard.

       JOYSTICK
              The airplane is controlled by the joystick. Control functions
              can be mapped to the joystick axes with the -b option.

       RCTRAN Reads the PPM signal from an r/c transmitter using the parallel
              port and the rctran kernel module.

       SERPIC For PPM interfaces connected to a serial port (aka 'FMS
              interface').

       SERIAL2
              A different serial port interface.

       PARALLEL
              Reads the PPM signal from an r/c transmitter using the parallel
              port.

       AUDIO  Reads the PPM signal from an r/c transmitter using a sound card.

       MNAV   Interface to the MNAV autopilot system.

       ZHENHUA
              For Walkera transmitters connected directly to the serial port.

FILES
       ~/.crrcsim/crrcsim.xml
              Default configuration file. Overridden by the -g option.
