NAME
       dnscap-rssm-rssac002 - Combine RSSAC002v3 YAML files

SYNOPSIS
       dnscap-rssm-rssac002 [ --no-recompile --keep-dnscap-rssm --sort ]
       files...

DESCRIPTION
       This Perl script will merge and remove metric specific to this plugin
       and replace others to fill in correct values for the new time period.
       The earliest start-period found will be used for all metrics.

       NOTE no parsing of start-period is performed, it is up to the operator
       to only give input files related to the same 24 hour period.

OPTIONS
       --no-recompile
              Disabled the combining of metrics and the removal of metrics
              specific to this plugin.

       --keep-dnscap-rssm
              Do the combining but keep the metrics specific to this plugin.

       --sort Output will always start with version:, service:, start-period:
              and metric:, rest of the values are not ordered by label.  This
              option enabled sorting of them, which is not required by the
              specification but may help in debugging and testing cases.
