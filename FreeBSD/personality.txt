PERSONALITY(8)          FreeBSD System Manager's Manual         PERSONALITY(8)

NAME
     personality – system configuration management utility

SYNOPSIS
     personality [options ...]

DESCRIPTION
     This script provides functionality for manipulating collections of
     configuration files which can be organised so as to alter the personality
     of a system.

     Initially, the base personality is established. This personality contains
     the reference copies of configuration files, and is used when creating
     new personalities.  The files which are currently considered part of the
     system's personality are those contained in the base personality.

     A new personality is established by making a copy of the base personality
     under a new name. Each personality maintains a separate copy of all
     configuration files under /etc/personality.

     To install a new personality, the files currently in place are saved back
     to the current personality as indicated in /etc/personality/current, and
     the files for the new personality copied into place.

     The select and menu commands which perform these installations are
     implemented in such a fashion as to only require the tools available on
     the root filesystem, so that they may be invoked at the earliest stage
     during system startup.

     If the current personality has become damaged, it can be restored from
     the saved copy.

     Files can be added to and removed from the personality set. When a new
     file is added, it is copied from the current system into all
     personalities and added to the list file. When a file is removed the
     current version is kept in place, but all copies are removed from saved
     personalities and the file is removed from the list.

FILES
     /etc/personality          configuration base
     /etc/personality/_base    system files under management of personality
     /etc/personality/current  backup location of current files before new
                               personality is copied into place
