UCHCOM(4)              FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual              UCHCOM(4)

NAME
     uchcom – WinChipHead CH341/CH340 serial adapter driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device usb
           device ucom
           device uchcom

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           uchcom_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The uchcom driver provides support for the WinChipHead CH341/CH340 USB-
     to-RS-232 Bridge chip.

     The device is accessed through the ucom(4) driver which makes it behave
     like a tty(4).

HARDWARE
     The uchcom driver supports the following adapters:

     •   HL USB-RS232

FILES
     /dev/ttyU*       for callin ports
     /dev/ttyU*.init
     /dev/ttyU*.lock  corresponding callin initial-state and lock-state
                      devices

     /dev/cuaU*       for callout ports
     /dev/cuaU*.init
     /dev/cuaU*.lock  corresponding callout initial-state and lock-state
                      devices

SEE ALSO
     tty(4), ucom(4), usb(4)

HISTORY
     The uchcom driver first appeared in NetBSD.  The first FreeBSD release to
     include it was FreeBSD 8.0.

BUGS
     Actually, this chip seems unable to drive other than 8 data bits and 1
     stop bit line.
