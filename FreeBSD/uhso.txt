UHSO(4)                FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                UHSO(4)

NAME
     uhso – support for several HSxPA devices from Option N.V.

SYNOPSIS
     The module can be loaded at boot time by placing the following line in
     loader.conf(5):

           uhso_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The uhso driver provides support for several HSxPA devices from Option
     N.V. that are based on their packet interface.  Each device has a set of
     serial ports and a raw IP packet interface.  The serial ports of the
     device are accessed through the ucom(4) driver which makes them behave
     like tty(4) devices.  The packet interface is exposed as a network
     interface.

     Establishing a connection on the packet interface is achieved by using
     the proprietary AT commands “AT_OWANCALL” and “AT_OWANDATA” on any of the
     available serial ports.

     The network interface must be configured manually using the data obtain
     from these calls.

     Each device usually have at least two or more serial ports, their
     individual purpose can be identified through sysctl(8).  Ports identified
     as “Modem” features a normal modem interface that can be used with PPP.
     Ports identified as “Diagnostic” uses a proprietary binary interface used
     for firmware upgrades, this port does not have a AT command interface and
     can not be used to control the device.  Other ports features an AT
     command interface that can be used for normal device control.

HARDWARE
     The uhso driver should work with most devices from Option.  The following
     devices have been verified to work

     •   Option GlobeSurfer iCON 7.2 (new firmware)
     •   Option GlobeTrotter Max 7.2 (new firmware)
     •   Option iCON 225
     •   Option iCON 452
     •   Option iCON 505

     The device features a mass storage device referred to as “Zero-CD” which
     contains drivers for Microsoft Windows; this is the default mode for the
     device.  The uhso driver automatically switches the device from “Zero-CD”
     mode to modem mode.  This behavior can be disabled by setting
     hw.usb.uhso.auto_switch to 0 using sysctl(8).

EXAMPLES
     Establishing a packet interface connection using the AT command interface
     available at one of the serial ports

           AT+CGDCONT=1,,"apn.provider"
           AT_OWANCALL=1,1,1
           OK
           _OWANCALL=1,1

           AT_OWANDATA=1
           _OWANDATA: 1, 10.11.12.13, 0.0.0.0, 10.2.3.4, 10.2.3.5, \
                   0.0.0.0, 0.0.0.0, 72000

     Configuring the interface

           ifconfig uhso0 10.11.12.13 up
           route add default -interface uhso0
           echo "nameserver 10.2.3.4" > /etc/resolv.conf
           echo "nameserver 10.2.3.5" >> /etc/resolv.conf

     The connection can be terminated with

           AT_OWANCALL=1,0,1
