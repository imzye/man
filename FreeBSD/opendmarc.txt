NAME
       opendmarc.conf - Configuration file for opendmarc


LOCATION
       /usr/local/etc/opendmarc.conf


DESCRIPTION
       opendmarc(8) implements the proposed DMARC specification for message
       authentication, policy enforcement, and reporting.  This file is its
       configuration file.

       Blank lines are ignored.  Lines containing a hash ("#") character are
       truncated at the hash character to allow for comments in the file.

       Other content should be the name of a parameter, followed by white
       space, followed by the value of that parameter, each on a separate
       line.

       For parameters that are Boolean in nature, only the first byte of the
       value is processed.  For positive values, the following are accepted:
       "T", "t", "Y", "y", "1".  For negative values, the following are
       accepted: "F", "f", "N", "n", "0".

       Some, but not all, of these parameters are also available as command
       line options to opendmarc(8).  However, new parameters are generally
       not added as command line options so the complete set of options is
       available here, and thus use of the configuration file is encouraged.
       In some future release, the set of available command line options is
       likely to get trimmed.

       See the opendmarc(8) man page for details about how and when the
       configuration file contents are reloaded.

       Unless otherwise stated, Boolean values default to "false", integer
       values default to 0, and string and dataset values default to being
       undefined.


PARAMETERS
       AuthservID (string)
              Sets the "authserv-id" to use when generating the
              Authentication-Results: header field after verifying a message.
              The default is to use the name of the MTA processing the
              message.  If the string "HOSTNAME" is provided, the name of the
              host running the filter (as returned by the gethostname(3)
              function) will be used.


       AuthservIDWithJobID (Boolean)
              If "true", requests that the authserv-id portion of the added
              Authentication-Results: header fields contain the job ID of the
              message being evaluated.


       AutoRestart (Boolean)
              Automatically re-start on failures.  Use with caution; if the
              filter fails instantly after it starts, this can cause a tight
              fork(2) loop.


       AutoRestartCount (integer)
              Sets the maximum automatic restart count.  After this number of
              automatic restarts, the filter will give up and terminate.  A
              value of 0 implies no limit; this is the default.


       AutoRestartRate (string)
              Sets the maximum automatic restart rate.  If the filter begins
              restarting faster than the rate defined here, it will give up
              and terminate.  This is a string of the form n/t[u] where n is
              an integer limiting the count of restarts in the given interval
              and t[u] defines the time interval through which the rate is
              calculated; t is an integer and u defines the units thus
              represented ("s" or "S" for seconds, the default; "m" or "M" for
              minutes; "h" or "H" for hours; "d" or "D" for days).  For
              example, a value of "10/1h" limits the restarts to 10 in one
              hour.  There is no default, meaning restart rate is not limited.


       Background (Boolean)
              Causes opendmarc to fork and exits immediately, leaving the
              service running in the background.  The default is "true".


       BaseDirectory (string)
              If set, instructs the filter to change to the specified
              directory using chdir(2) before doing anything else.  This means
              any files referenced elsewhere in the configuration file can be
              specified relative to this directory.  It's also useful for
              arranging that any crash dumps will be saved to a specific
              location.


       ChangeRootDirectory (string)
              Requests that the operating system change the effective root
              directory of the process to the one specified here prior to
              beginning execution.  chroot (2) requires superuser access. A
              warning will be generated if UserID is not also set.


       CopyFailuresTo (string)
              Adds the specified recipient to the message's envelope if it
              fails the DMARC evaluation.


       DomainWhitelist (string)
              A brief list of whitelisted domains for which ARC signature
              headers are trusted as determined by evaluating entries in the
              "arc.chain" field found in a locally generated Authentication-
              Results header.

              This list will be concatenated with DomainWhitelistFile (if
              provided).


       DomainWhitelistFile (string)
              A comprehensive list of whitelisted domains for which ARC
              signature headers are trusted as determined by evaluating
              entries in the "arc.chain" field found in a locally generated
              Authentication-Results header.

              This list will be concatenated with DomainWhitelist (if
              provided).


       DomainWhitelistSize (integer)
              Sets the capacity of the whitelisted domains data structure. The
              value specifies the maximum number of entries including domains
              listed in the DomainWhitelist configuration parameter and the
              domains listed in the DomainWhiteListFile. The final size will
              be increased by approximately 20% to increase the efficiency of
              the hashing algorithm.


       DNSTimeout (integer)
              Sets the DNS timeout in seconds.  A value of 0 causes an
              infinite wait.  The default is 5.  Ignored if not using an
              asynchronous resolver package.


       EnableCoredumps (Boolean)
              On systems that have such support, make an explicit request to
              the kernel to dump cores when the filter crashes for some
              reason.  Some modern UNIX systems suppress core dumps during
              crashes for security reasons if the user ID has changed during
              the lifetime of the process.  Currently only supported on Linux.


       FailureReports (Boolean)
              Enables generation of failure reports when the DMARC test fails
              and the purported sender of the message has requested such
              reports.  Reports are formatted per RFC6591.


       FailureReportsBcc (string)
              When failure reports are enabled and one is to be generated,
              always send one to the address(es) specified here.  If a failure
              report is requested by the domain owner, the address(es) are
              added in a Bcc: field.  If no request is made, they address(es)
              are used in a To: field.  There is no default.


       FailureReportsOnNone (Boolean)
              Supplementary to the previous setting, enables generation of
              failure reports for sending domains that publish a "none"
              policy.


       FailureReportsSentBy (string)
              Sets the value of the From: field to be used when sending
              failure reports (see above).  The default is to use the userid
              of the user executing the filter and the local host name to
              construct an email address.


       HistoryFile (string)
              If set, specifies the location of a text file to which records
              are written that can be used to generate DMARC aggregate
              reports.  Records are batches of rows containing information
              about a single received message, and include all relevant
              information needed to generate a DMARC aggregate report.  It is
              expected that this will not be used in its raw form, but rather
              periodically imported into a relational database from which the
              aggregate reports can be extracted using
              opendmarc-importstats(8).


       HoldQuarantinedMessages (Boolean)
              If set, the milter will signal to the mta that messages with
              p=quarantine, which fail dmarc authentication, should be held in
              the MTA's "Hold" or "Quarantine" queue.  The name varies by MTA.
              If false, messsages will be accepted and passed along with the
              regular mail flow, and the quarantine will be left up to
              downstream MTA/MDA/MUA filters, if any, to handle by re-
              evaluating the headers, including the Authentication-Results
              header added by this filter.  The default is "false".


       HoldQuarantinedMessages (Boolean)
              If set, the milter will signal to the mta that messages with
              p=quarantine, which fail dmarc authentication, should be held in
              the MTA's "Hold" or "Quarantine" queue.  The name varies by MTA.
              If false, messsages will be accepted and passed along with the
              regular mail flow, and the quarantine will be left up to
              downstream MTA/MDA/MUA filters, if any, to handle by re-
              evaluating the headers, including the Authentication-Results
              header added by this filter.  The default is "false".


       IgnoreAuthenticatedClients (Boolean)
              If set, causes mail from authenticated clients (i.e., those that
              used SMTP AUTH) to be ignored by the filter.  The default is
              "false".


       IgnoreHosts (string)
              Specifies the path to a file that contains a list of hostnames,
              IP addresses, and/or CIDR expressions identifying hosts whose
              SMTP connections are to be ignored by the filter.  If not
              specified, defaults to "127.0.0.1" only.


       IgnoreMailFrom (string)
              Gives a list of domain names whose mail (based on the From:
              domain) is to be ignored by the filter.  The list should be
              comma-separated.  Matching against this list is case-
              insensitive.  The default is an empty list, meaning no mail is
              ignored.


       MilterDebug (integer)
              Sets the debug level to be requested from the milter library.
              The default is 0.


       PidFile (string)
              Specifies the path to a file that should be created at process
              start containing the process ID.


       PublicSuffixList (string)
              Specifies the path to a file that contains top-level domains
              (TLDs) that will be used to compute the Organizational Domain
              for a given domain name, as described in the DMARC
              specification.  If not provided, the filter will not be able to
              determine the Organizational Domain and only the presented
              domain will be evaluated.  This file should be periodically
              updated.  One location to retrieve the file from is
              https://publicsuffix.org/list/


       RecordAllMessages (Boolean)
              If set and HistoryFile is in use, all received messages are
              recorded to the history file.  If not set (the default), only
              messages for which the From: domain published a DMARC record
              will be recorded in the history file.


       RejectFailures (Boolean)
              If set, messages will be rejected if they fail the DMARC
              evaluation, or temp-failed if evaluation could not be completed.
              By default, no message will be rejected or temp-failed
              regardless of the outcome of the DMARC evaluation of the
              message.  Instead, an Authentication-Results header field will
              be added.  The default is "false".


       RejectMultiValueFrom (Boolean)
              If set, messages with multiple addresses in the From: field of
              the message will be rejected unless all domain names in that
              field are the same.  They will otherwise be ignored by the
              filter (the default).


       ReportCommand (string)
              Indicates the shell command to which failure reports should be
              passed for delivery when FailureReports is enabled.  Defaults to
              /usr/sbin/sendmail.


       RequiredHeaders (Boolean)
              If set, the filter will ensure the header of the message
              conforms to the basic header field count restrictions laid out
              in RFC5322, Section 3.6.  Messages failing this test are
              rejected without further processing.  A From: field from which
              no domain name could be extracted will also be rejected.


       Socket (string)
              Specifies the socket that should be established by the filter to
              receive connections from sendmail(8) in order to provide
              service.  socketspec is in one of two forms: local:path, which
              creates a UNIX domain socket at the specified path, or
              inet:port[@host] or inet6:port[@host] which creates a TCP socket
              on the specified port for the appropriate protocol family.  If
              the host is not given as either a hostname or an IP address, the
              socket will be listening on all interfaces.  This option is
              mandatory either in the configuration file or on the command
              line.  If an IP address is used, it must be enclosed in square
              brackets.


       SoftwareHeader (Boolean)
              Causes opendmarc to add a "DMARC-Filter" header field indicating
              the presence of this filter in the path of the message from
              injection to delivery.  The product's name, version, and the job
              ID are included in the header field's contents.


       SPFIgnoreResults (Boolean)
              Causes the filter to ignore any SPF results in the header of the
              message.  This is useful if you want the filter to perform SPF
              checks itself, or because you don't trust the arriving header.
              The default is "false".


       SPFSelfValidate (Boolean)
              Causes the filter to perform a fallback SPF check itself when it
              can find no SPF results in the message header.  If
              SPFIgnoreResults is also set, it never looks for SPF results in
              headers and always performs the SPF check itself when this is
              set.  The default is "false".


       Syslog (Boolean)
              Log via calls to syslog(3) any interesting activity.


       SyslogFacility (string)
              Log via calls to syslog(3) using the named facility.  The
              facility names are the same as the ones allowed in
              syslog.conf(5).  The default is "mail".


       TrustedAuthservIDs (string)
              Provides a list of authserv-ids that are to be used to identify
              Authentication-Results header fields whose contents are to be
              assumed as valid input for the DMARC assessment.  To provide a
              list, separate values by commas.  If the string "HOSTNAME" is
              provided, the name of the host running the filter (as returned
              by the gethostname(3) function) will be used.  Matching against
              this list is case-insensitive.  The default is to use the value
              of AuthservID.


       UMask (integer)
              Requests a specific permissions mask to be used for file
              creation.  This only really applies to creation of the socket
              when Socket specifies a UNIX domain socket, and to the PidFile
              (if any); temporary files are created by the mkstemp(3) function
              that enforces a specific file mode on creation regardless of the
              process umask.  See umask(2) for more information.


       UserID (string)
              Attempts to become the specified userid before starting
              operations.  The value is of the form userid[:group].  The
              process will be assigned all of the groups and primary group ID
              of the named userid unless an alternate group is specified.
