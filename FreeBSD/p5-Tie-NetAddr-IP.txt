NAME
       Tie::NetAddr::IP - Implements a Hash where the key is a subnet

SYNOPSIS
         use Tie::NetAddr::IP;

         my %WhereIs;

         tie %WhereIs, Tie::NetAddr::IP;

         $WhereIs{"10.0.10.0/24"} = "Lab, First Floor";
         $WhereIs{"10.0.20.0/24"} = "Datacenter, Second Floor";
         $WhereIs{"10.0.30.0/27"} = "Remote location";
         $WhereIs{"0.0.0.0/0"} = "God knows where";

         foreach $host ("10.0.10.1", "10.0.20.15", "10.0.32.17", "10.10.0.1") {
            print "Host $host is in ", $WhereIs{$host}, "\n";
         }

         foreach $subnet (keys %WhereIs) {
            print "Network ", $subnet, " is used in ",
            $WhereIs{$subnet}, "\n";
         }

         untie %WhereIs;

DESCRIPTION
       This module overloads hashes so that the key can be a subnet as in
       NetAddr::IP. When looking values up, an interpretation will be made to
       find the given key within the subnets specified in the hash.

       The code sample provided on the SYNOPSIS would print out the locations
       of every machine in the "foreach" loop.

       Care must be taken, as only strings that can be parsed as an IP address
       by NetAddr::IP can be used as keys for this hash.

       Iterators on the hash such as "foreach", "each", "keys" and "values"
       will only see the actual subnets provided as keys to the hash. When
       looking up a value such as in $hash{$ipaddress} this IP address will be
       looked up among the subnets existing as keys within the hash. The
       matching subnet with the longest mask (ie, the most specific subnet)
       will win and its associated value will be returned.

       This code can be distributed freely according to the terms set forth in
       the PERL license provided that proper credit is maintained. Please send
       bug reports and feedback to the author for further improvement.
