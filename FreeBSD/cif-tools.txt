NAME
       cif-diff - A tool to compare two mmCIF files

SYNOPSIS
       cif-diff [OPTION] file1 file2

DESCRIPTION
       The mmCIF format does not specify the order in which categories or
       fields should be recorded. Using this tool, you can reorder a second
       file in the same way as the first before comparing the content making
       it easier to spot differences.

OPTIONS
       --category=arg
              Limit the comparison to this category, default is to show
              differences in all categories. This option can be specified
              multiple times.

       --max-diff-count=nr
              Display at most nr items per category. Default is 5 items, if
              you specify zero the number of items will unlimited.

              This option has no effect when the --text option is specified.

       --text Default is to display the differences in some kind of summary.
              But if you prefer to use a more graphical diff: this option will
              use vimdiff to display the differences.

       --icase
              Pass the ignore case option to vimdiff.
