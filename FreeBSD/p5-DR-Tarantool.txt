DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a synchronous and asynchronous driver for
       Tarantool <http://tarantool.org>.

       The driver does not have external dependencies, but includes the
       official light-weight Tarantool C client (a single C header which
       implements all protocol formatting) for packing requests and unpacking
       server responses.

       This driver implements "iproto" protocol described in
       https://github.com/mailru/tarantool/blob/master/doc/box-protocol.txt

       It is built on top of AnyEvent - an asynchronous event framework, and
       is therefore easiest to integrate into a program which is already based
       on AnyEvent. A synchronous version of the driver exists as well, it
       starts AnyEvent event machine for every request.

       The driver supports three work flow types:

       DR::Tarantool::AsyncClient
           The primary type, provides an asynchronous, callback-based API.
           Requires a running AnyEvent machine.

       DR::Tarantool::SyncClient
           Is built on top of DR::Tarantool::AsyncClient. Starts AnyEvent
           machine for every request. After a request is served, the event
           loop is stopped, and the results are returned to the caller, or, in
           case of an error, an exception is thrown.

       DR::Tarantool::CoroClient
           Is also built on top of DR::Tarantool::AsyncClient, but is designed
           to work in cooperative multitasking environment provided by Coro.
           Is fully syntax-compatible with DR::Tarantool::SyncClient, but
           requires a running event loop to operate, like
           DR::Tarantool::AsyncClient. Requests from different coroutines are
           served concurrently.

       Tarantool <http://tarantool.org> binary protocol contains no
       representation of database schema or tuple field types.  Due to this
       deficiency, to easily integrate with Perl and automatically convert
       tuple fields to Perl values, the driver needs to know field names and
       types. To tell the driver about them, an instance of a dedicated class
       must be used.  DR::Tarantool::Spaces is essentially a Perl hash which
       describes field types and names for each space used in the program.  It
       can hardly be useful on its own, but once a connection is "enlightened"
       with an instance of this class, access to all tuple fields by a field
       name becomes possible. Type conversion, as well as packing/unpacking
       from Tarantool binary format is performed automatically.

       Please follow the docs for DR::Tarantool::Spaces to learn how to
       describe a schema.

   Establishing a connection
       DR::Tarantool::AsyncClient

               DR::Tarantool::AsyncClient->connect(
                       host    => $host,
                       port    => $port,
                       spaces  => { ... },
                       sub {
                               my ($tnt) = @_;
                               ...

                       }
               );

       The callback passed to connect() gets invoked after a connection is
       established. The only argument of the callback is the newly established
       connection handle. The handle's type is DR::Tarantool::AsyncClient.

       DR::Tarantool::CoroClient and DR::Tarantool::SyncClient

               my $tnt = DR::Tarantool::SyncClient->connect(
                       host    => $host,
                       port    => $port,
                       spaces  => { ... }
               );

               my $tnt = DR::Tarantool::CoroClient->connect(
                       host    => $host,
                       port    => $port,
                       spaces  => { ... }
               );

       The only difference of synchronous versions from the asynchronous one
       is absence of a callback. The created connection handle is returned
       directly from connect().  In this spirit, the only difference of any
       synchronous API all from the asynchronous counterpart is also in
       absence of the callback.

   Working with tuples
       Querying

               my $user123 = $tnt->select('users' => 123);

               my $users_by_roles = $tnt->select('users' => 'admins' => 'role_index');

       It is possible to select data by a primary key (expects a Perl scalar),
       secondary, multi-part key (expects an array).

       The default index used for selection is the primary one, a non-default
       index can be set by providing index name.

       The contents of the result set is interpreted in accordance with schema
       description provided in DR::Tarantool::Spaces.  Supported data types
       are numbers, Unicode strings, JSON, fixed-point decimals.

       Insertion

               $tnt->insert('users' => [ 123, 'vasya', 'admin' ]);

       Insert a tuple into space 'users', defined in spaces hash on connect.

       Deletion

               $tnt->delete(users => 123);

       Delete a tuple from space 'users'. The deletion is always performed by
       the primary key.

       Update

               $tnt->update(users => 123 => [[ role => set => 'not_admin' ]]);

       It is possible to modify any field in a tuple. A field can be accessed
       by field name or number. A set of modifications can be provided in a
       Perl array.

       The following update operations are supported:

       set Assign a field

       add, and, or, xor
           Arithmetic and bitwise operations for integers.

       substr
           Replace a substring with a paste (similar to Perl splice).

       insert
           Insert a field before the given field.

       delete
           Delete a field.

       push
           Append a field at the tail of the tuple.

       pop Pop a field from the tail of the tuple.

       Lua

               $tnt->call_lua(my_proc_name => [ arguments, ...]);

       Invoke a Lua stored procedure by name.

   Supported data types
       The driver supports all Tarantool types (NUM, NUM64, STR), as well as
       some client-only types, which are converted to the above server types
       automatically on the client:

       UTF8STR
           A unicode string.

       MONEY
           Fixed decimal currency. Stores the value on the server in NUM type,
           by multiplying the given amount by 100. The largest amount that can
           be stored in this type is, therefore, around 20 000 000.  Can store
           negative values.

       BIGMONEY
           The same as above, but uses NUM64 as the underlying storage.

       JSON
           An arbitrary Perl object is automatically serialized to JSON with
           JSON::XS on insertion, and deserialized on selection.

       The basic data transfer unit in Tarantool protocol is a single tuple. A
       selected tuple is automatically wrapped into an instance of class
       DR::Tarantool::Tuple. An object of this class can be used as an
       associative container, in which any field can be accessed by field
       name:

               my $user = $tnt->select(users => 123);

               printf("user: %s, role: %s\n", $user->name, $user->role);

       To run driver tests, the following Perl modules are also necessary:
       AnyEvent, Coro, Test::Pod, Test::Spelling, Devel::GlobalDestruction,
       JSON::XS.

       To run tests, do:
           perl Makefile.PL
           make
           make test

       The test suite attempts to find the server and start it, thus make sure
       tarantool_box is available in the path, or export
       TARANTOOL_BOX=/path/to/tarantool_box.

EXPORT
   tarantool
       connects to Tarantool <http://tarantool.org> in synchronous mode using
       DR::Tarantool::SyncClient.

   rsync_tarantool
       connects to Tarantool <http://tarantool.org> in synchronous mode using
       DR::Tarantool::RealSyncClient.

   async_tarantool
       connects to tarantool <http://tarantool.org> in async mode using
       DR::Tarantool::AsyncClient.

   coro_tarantol
       connects to tarantool <http://tarantool.org> in async mode using
       DR::Tarantool::CoroClient.

   :constant
       Exports constants to use in a client request as flags:

       TNT_FLAG_RETURN
           With this flag on, each INSERT/UPDATE request returns the new value
           of the tuple. DELETE returns the deleted tuple, if it is found.

       TNT_FLAG_ADD
           With this flag on, INSERT returns an error if an old tuple with the
           same primary key already exists. No tuple is inserted in this case.

       TNT_FLAG_REPLACE
           With this flag on, INSERT returns an error if an old tuple for the
           primary key does not exist.  Without either of the flags, INSERT
           replaces the old tuple if it doesn't exist.

   :all
       Exports all functions and constants.

TODO
       •   Support push, pop in UPDATE.

       •   Make it possible to construct select, delete keys from Perl hashes,
           not just Perl arrays.

       •   Support DR::Tarantool::Tuple as an argument to insert.
