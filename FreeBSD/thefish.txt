The Fish(1)          FreeBSD General Commands Manual (con)         The Fish(1)

NAME
     thefish – user friendly rc.conf editor/management tool

SYNOPSIS
     thefish [-cvh]

DESCRIPTION
     The Fish provides a graphical tool (with GTK+, Qt and ncurses frontends)
     to manage and edit system variables stored in /etc/defaults/rc.conf and
     /etc/rc.conf

     For testing purposes, or, for users that need to have different
     configurations, the program honours two environment variables:
     FISH_RC_DEFAULTS and FISH_RC. Note that, although this program was
     created to edit rc.conf, it can edit similarly structured files, like
     /boot/loader.conf. This is a side effect of the way the parser was
     designed and, even if it works, it's not officially supported.

     The following options can be used:

     -c Force console mode
     -v Show version and exit
     -h Show help

Modifying Values
     There are two kinds of entries in rc.conf: Knobs and Strings.  Knobs can
     only be either YES or NO. Strings can have any value. To modify a Knob
     simply click on the toggle button associated with it. To modify a string,
     edit the value to your needs. In the GTK+ version the status of each
     entry is noted by small icon.  A floppy disk icon means that entry was
     modified or is new and, therefore, needs to be saved. Selecting a row
     will print a little description about the variable in the status bar.

Adding new entries
     To add a new entry, simply press the “Add” button and fill in the form.
     “Name” can be any name that is not already in use.  “Value” can be "YES"
     , "NO", or something else. Note that “Value” must go between quotes, or
     you will get an error. “Comment” is an optional comment, and it will be
     appended to the new entry when saving the data. Depending on what value
     you enter, the new entry will appear at the end of the Knob list, or the
     String list. Changes won't be saved until you press “Save”.

Saving changes
     To permanently save your changes, you need to have write access to
     /etc/rc.conf (or FISH_RC) and press “Save”. Once you do so, the
     modifications and new entries will be stored in a delta fashion.

ENVIRONMENT
     By default, The Fish reads /etc/defaults/rc.conf and /etc/rc.conf
     You can change this behaviour by setting two environment variables:

     FISH_RC_DEFAULTS  user selected defaults file

     FISH_RC           user selected personal settings file

FILES
     /etc/defaults/rc.conf
     /etc/rc.conf

SEE ALSO
     rc.conf(5)

HISTORY
     The Fish started as a little project in January 2002, based upon an idea
     posted by Terry Lambert on the freebsd-hackers mailing list.
