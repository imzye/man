Git::Repository::Log(3)                    User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Git::Repository::Log - Class representing git log data

SYNOPSIS
           # load the Log plugin
           use Git::Repository 'Log';

           # get the log for last commit
           my ($log) = Git::Repository->log( '-1' );

           # get the author's email
           print my $email = $log->author_email;

DESCRIPTION
       "Git::Repository::Log" is a class whose instances represent log items
       from a git log stream.

CONSTRUCTOR
       This method shouldn't be used directly. Git::Repository::Log::Iterator
       should be the preferred way to create "Git::Repository::Log" objects.

   new
       Create a new "Git::Repository::Log" instance, using the list of
       key/values passed as parameters. The supported keys are (from the
       output of "git log --pretty=raw"):

       commit
           The commit id (ignoring the extra information added by --decorate).

       tree
           The tree id.

       parent
           The parent list, separated by spaces.

       author
           The author information.

       committer
           The committer information.

       message
           The log message (including the 4-space indent normally output by
           git log).

       gpgsig
           The commit signature.

       mergetag
           The mergetag information.

       diff_from
           The commit from which the diff was taken.

           This is the extra "from" information on the commit header that is
           added by git when the log contains a diff (using the "-p" or
           "--name-status" option). In this case, "git log" may show the same
           commit several times.

       extra
           Any extra text that might be added by extra options passed to git
           log (e.g. "-p" or "--name-status").

       Note that since "git tag --pretty=raw" does not provide the "encoding"
       header (and provides the message properly decoded), this information
       will not be available via Git::Repository::Plugin::Log.
