NAME
       SSN::Validate - Perl extension to do SSN Validation

SYNOPSIS
         use SSN::Validate;

         my $ssn = new SSN::Validate;

         or

         my $ssn = SSN::Validate->new({'ignore_bad_combo' => 1});

         if ($ssn->valid_ssn("123-45-6789")) {
           print "It's a valid SSN";
         }

         my $state = $ssn->get_state("123456789");
         my $state = $ssn->get_state("123");

               print $ssn->valid_area('123') ? "Valid" : "Invalid";
               print $ssn->valid_area('123-56-7890') ? "Valid" : "Invalid";

DESCRIPTION
       This module is intented to do some Social Security Number validation
       (not verification) beyond just seeing if it contains 9 digits and isn't
       all 0s. The data is taken from the Social Security Admin. website,
       specifically:

       http://www.ssa.gov/foia/stateweb.html

       As of this initial version, SSNs are validated by ensuring it is 9
       digits, the area, group and serial are not all 0s, and that the area is
       within a valid range used by the SSA.

       It will also return the state which the SSN was issues, if that data is
       known (state of "??" for unknown states/regions).

       A SSN is formed by 3 parts, the area (A), group (G) and serial (S):

       AAAA-GG-SSSS

   METHODS
       new();
           You can pass an arg of 'ignore_bad_combo' as true if you wish to
           ignore any defined bad AAAA-GG combinations. Things will be on the
           list until I see otherwise on the SSA website or some other means
           of proof.

       valid_ssn($ssn);
           The SSN can be of any format (111-11-1111, 111111111, etc...). All
           non-digits are stripped.

           This method will return true if it is valid, and false if it isn't.
           It uses the below methods to check the validity of each section.

       valid_area($ssn);
           This will see if the area is valid by using the ranges in use by
           the SSA. You can pass this method a full SSN, or just the 3 digit
           area.

       valid_group($group);
           Will make sure that the group isn't "00", as well as check the
           AREA/GROUP combo for known invalid ones, and the SSA High Groups.

           If given a 2 digit GROUP, it will only make sure that that GROUP
           isn't "00".

           If given a number in length above 2 digits, it will attempt to
           split into an AREA and GROUP and do further validation.

       valid_serial($serial);
           This is currently only making sure the serial isn't "0000", and
           that's all it will ever do. From my reading, "0000" is the only
           non-valid serial.

           This is also semi-useful right now, as it expects only 4 digits.
           Later it will take both 4 digits or a full serial.

       get_state($ssn);
           You can give this a full SSN or 3 digit area. It will return the
           state, if known, from where the given area is issued. Invalid areas
           will return false.

       get_description($ssn);
           If there is a description associated with the state or region, this
           will return it.. or will return an empty string.

   TODO
       * Change how the data is stored. I don't like how it is done now... but
       works.

       * Find out state(s) for areas which aren't known right now.

       * Automate this module almost as completely as possible for
         distribution.

       * Consider SSN::Validate::SSDI for Social Security Death Index (SSDI)

       * Possibly change how data is stored (first on TODO), and provide my
            extract script for people to run on their own. This way, maybe
       they      could update the SSA changes on their own, instead of being
       dependant      on the module for this, or having to update the module
       when the SSA   makes changes. I think I like this idea.

   EXPORT
       None by default.

BUGS
       Please let me know if something doesn't work as expected.

       You can report bugs via the CPAN RT:
       <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html?Dist=SSN-Validate>

       If you are feeling nice, and would like quicker fixes, please provide a
       diff against Validate.pm and the appropriate test file(s). If you are
       making something invalid which is currently valid, or vice versa,
       please provide a reference to why the change is needed. Thanks!

       Patches Welcome!
