NAME
       paargs - wrapper for paexec similar to xargs

SYNOPSIS
       paargs [OPTIONS] <command> <args>

DESCRIPTION
       paargs is a simple wrapper over paexec that simplifies use of paexec's
       capalities. The use of paargs is actually very similar to xargs. paargs
       runs paexec with the following options enabled by default:

       •   -C -- for specifying command as free arguments,

       •   -x -- for being xargs-like,

       •   -l -- 0-based task number is included to the output of paargs, this
           allows to reorder the sliced output,

       •   -e -- for the same purposes as -l,

       •   -g -- this flag allows analysis of command's exit status,

       •   -md= -- disables task delimiter for -g mode enabled by default, as
           a result the whole line given on input is considered as a task.

OPTIONS
       -h  Display this help.

       -V  Display version.

       -P nodes
           Same as -n in paexec.

       -t transport
           Passed directly to paexec.

       -c command
           Command with its arguments. By default, free arguments are used for
           setting command and its arguments.

       -I replstr
           Execute command for each task, replacing one or more occurrences of
           replstr with the entire task.

       -X  Passed directly to paexec.

       -f  Flushes stdout after recieving an end-of-task line.

       -0  Passed directly to paexec.

       -Z timeout
           Passed directly to paexec.

       -z  Passed directly to paexec.

       -m arg
           Passed directly to paexec.
