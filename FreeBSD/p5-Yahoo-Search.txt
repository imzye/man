NAME
       Yahoo::Search - Perl interface to the Yahoo! Search public API.

VERSION
       version 1.11.3

       The following search spaces are supported:

       Doc
          Common web search for documents (html, pdf, doc, ...), including Y!Q
          contextual search.

       Image
          Image search (jpeg, png, gif, ...)

       Video
          Video file search (avi, mpeg, realmedia, ...)

       News
          News article search

       Local
          Yahoo! Local area (ZIP-code-based Yellow-Page like search)

       Terms
          A pseudo-search to report the important search terms from the
          provided content or content+query.

       Spell
          A pseudo-search to fetch a "did you mean?" spelling suggestion for a
          search term.

       Related
          A pseudo-search to fetch "also try" related-searches for a search
          term.

       (Note: what this Perl API calls "Doc" Search is what Yahoo! calls "Web"
       Search. But gee, aren't all web searches "Web" search, including
       Image/News/Video/etc?)

       Yahoo!'s raw API, which this package uses, is described at:

         http://developer.yahoo.net/

DOCS
       The full documentation for this suite of classes is spread among these
       packages:

          Yahoo::Search
          Yahoo::Search::Request
          Yahoo::Search::Response
          Yahoo::Search::Result

       However, you need "use" only Yahoo::Search, which brings in the others
       as needed.

       In the common case, you need read only the first and the last
       (Yahoo::Search to create a query, and Yahoo::Search::Result to
       interpret the results).

SYNOPSIS
       Yahoo::Search provides a rich and full-featured set of classes for
       accessing the various features of Yahoo! Search, and also offers a
       variety of shortcuts to allow simple access, such as the following Doc
       search:

        use Yahoo::Search;
        my @Results = Yahoo::Search->Results(Doc => "Britney latest marriage",
                                             AppId => "YahooDemo",
                                             # The following args are optional.
                                             # (Values shown are package defaults).
                                             Mode         => 'all', # all words
                                             Start        => 0,
                                             Count        => 10,
                                             Type         => 'any', # all types
                                             AllowAdult   => 0, # no porn, please
                                             AllowSimilar => 0, # no dups, please
                                             Language     => undef,
                                            );
        warn $@ if $@; # report any errors

        for my $Result (@Results)
        {
            printf "Result: #%d\n",  $Result->I + 1,
            printf "Url:%s\n",       $Result->Url;
            printf "%s\n",           $Result->ClickUrl;
            printf "Summary: %s\n",  $Result->Summary;
            printf "Title: %s\n",    $Result->Title;
            printf "In Cache: %s\n", $Result->CacheUrl;
            print "\n";
        }

       The first argument to "Results" indicates which search space is to be
       queried (in this case, Doc). The second argument is the search term or
       phrase (described in detail in the next section). Subsequent arguments
       are optional key/value pairs (described in detail in the section after
       that) -- the ones shown in the example are those allowed for a Doc
       query, with the values shown being the defaults.

       "Results" returns a list of Yahoo::Search::Result objects, one per item
       (in the case of a Doc search, an item is a web page, pdf document, doc
       document, etc.). The methods available to a "Result" object are
       dependent upon the search space of the original query -- see
       Yahoo::Search::Result documentation for the complete list.

Search term / phrase
       Within a search phrase (""Britney latest marriage"" in the example
       above), words that you wish to be included even if they would otherwise
       be eliminated as "too common" should be proceeded with a ""+"". Words
       that you wish to exclude should be proceeded with a ""-"". Words can be
       separated with ""OR"" (the default for the "any" Mode, described
       below), and can be wrapped in double quotes to identify an exact phrase
       (the default with the "phrase" Mode, also described below).

       There are also a number of "Search Meta Words", as described at
       http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/ysearch/basics/basics-04.html and
       http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/ysearch/tips/tips-03.html , which can
       stand along or be combined with Doc searches (and, to some extent, some
       of the others -- YMMV):

       site:
           allows one to find all documents within a particular domain and all
           its subdomains. Example: site:yahoo.com

       hostname:
           allows one to find all documents from a particular host only.
           Example: hostname:autos.yahoo.comm

       link:
           allows one to find documents that link to a particular url.
           Example: link:http://autos.yahoo.com/

       url:
           allows one to find a specific document in Yahoo!'s index.  Example:
           url:http://edit.autos.yahoo.com/repair/tree/0.html

       inurl:
           allows one to find a specific keyword as part of indexed urls.
           Example: inurl:bulgarian

       intitle:
           allows one to find a specific keyword as part of the indexed
           titles.  Example: intitle:Bulgarian

       As an example combining a number of different search styles, consider

           my @Results = Yahoo::Search->Results(Doc => 'site:TheSmokingGun.com "Michael Jackson" -arrest',
                                                AppId => "YahooDemo");

       This returns data about pages at TheSmokingGun.com about Michael
       Jackson that don't contain the word "arrest" (yes, there are actually a
       few such pages).

Query arguments
       As mentioned above, the arguments allowed in a "Query" call depend upon
       the search space of the query. Here is a table of the possible
       arguments, showing which apply to queries of which search space:

                         Doc   Image  Video  News   Local  Spell Related Terms

       Here are details of each:

       AppId
           A character string which identifies the application making use of
           the Yahoo! Search API. (Think of it along the lines of an HTTP
           User-Agent string.)

           The characters allowed are space, plus "A-Za-z0-9_()[]*+-=,.:@\"

           This argument is required of all searches (sorry). You can make up
           whatever AppId you'd like, but you are encouraged to register it
           via the link on

             http://developer.yahoo.net/

           especially if you are creating something that will be widely
           distributed.

           As mentioned below in Defaults and Default Overrides, it's
           particularly convenient to get the "AppId" out of the way by
           putting it on the "use" line, e.g.

              use Yahoo::Search AppId => 'just testing';

           It then applies to all queries unless explicitly overridden.

       Mode
           Must be one of: "all" (the default), "any", or "phrase". Indicates
           how multiple words in the search term are used: search for
           documents with all words, documents with any words, or documents
           that contain the search term as an exact phrase.

       Start
           Indicates the ordinal of the first result to be returned, e.g. the
           "30" of "showing results 30-40" (except that "Start" is zero-based,
           not one-based). The default is zero, meaning that the primary
           results will be returned.

       Count
           Indicates how many items should be returned. The default is 10. The
           maximum allowed depends on the search space being queried. The
           maximum isn't enforced by this module.

           Note that

             Yahoo::Search::MaxCount($SearchSpace)

           and

             $SearchEngine->MaxCount($SearchSpace)

           return the assumed maximum count allowed for the given
           $SearchSpace.  These counts may be out of date.

       Context
           By providing a context string to a Doc query, you change the
           request from a normal document query to a Y!Q contextual query. Y!Q
           is described at

              http://yq.search.yahoo.com/

           The "Content" string can be raw text, html, etc., and is to provide
           the document search more information about what kind of results are
           wanted.

           For example, without a "Context", a document search for "Madonna"
           returns the most popular documents (which are invariably about the
           famous pop singer). However, if you provide a context string even
           as simple as "Virgin Mary", the results skew away from the pop
           singer toward the Mother of God.  Since it's likely that a
           confusion between the two would be less than optimal in pretty much
           every conceivable case, this is a Good Thing.

           When a "Context" is given, the query string itself may be empty.
           For example, if you have the text of a blog entry in $BlogText, you
           can fetch "related links" via:

              use Yahoo::Search AppId => 'my blog stuff';
              my @Results = Yahoo::Search->Results(Doc => undef, Context => $BlogText);

           In a Terms search, "Context" is required.

       Country
           Attempts to restrict the Doc search to web servers residing in the
           named country. As of this writing, the Yahoo! web services support
           the following codes for "Country":

            code   country
            ----   ---------------
             ar    Argentina
             au    Australia
             at    Austria
             be    Belgium
             br    Brazil
             ca    Canada
             cn    China
             cz    Czech Republic
             dk    Denmark
             fi    Finland
             fr    France
             de    Germany
             it    Italy
             jp    Japan
             kr    Korea
             nl    Netherlands
             no    Norway
             pl    Poland
             rf    Russian Federation
             es    Spain
             se    Sweden
             ch    Switzerland
             tw    Taiwan
             uk    United Kingdom
             us    United States

           In addition, the code "default" is the same as the lack of a
           country specifier: no country-related restrictions.

           The above list can be found in %Yahoo::Search::KnownCountry.

           Because the list of countries may be updated more often than this
           Perl API, this Perl API does not attempt to restrict the "Country"
           value to members of this specific list. If you provide a "Country"
           value which is not supported by Yahoo!'s web services, a "400 Bad
           Request" error is returned in "@$".

       Region
           Uses a different regional version of the Yahoo! web service. For
           example, setting "Region" to "de" will show the results as returned
           from de.search.yahoo.com. Note that this does not restrict the
           results in the way "Country" and "Language" do, but will merely
           lead to a different weighting of the results. As of this writing,
           the Yahoo! web services support the following codes for "Region":

            code   country

             us    United States (yahoo.com)

       License
           For "Doc" searches, can be:

           "any"     (the default) -- results are not filtered with respect to
                     licenses

           "cc_any"  Only items with a Creative Commons license (of any type)
                     are returned.  See their (horribly designed hard to find
                     anything substantial) site at:

                       http://creativecommons.org/

           "cc_commercial"
                     Only items with a Creative Commons license which allows
                     some kind of commercial use are returned.

           "cc_modifiable"
                     Only items with a Creative Commons license which allows
                     modification (e.g. derived works) of some kind are
                     returned.

           You may combine the above to create an intersection, e.g.

              License => "cc_commercial+cc_modifiable"

           (space, comma, or plus-separated) returns items which allow both
           some kind of commercial use, and their use in some kinds of
           derivative works.

       AllowSimilar
           If this boolean is true (the default is false), similar results
           which would otherwise not be returned are included in the result
           set.

       AllowAdult
           If this boolean is false (the default), results considered to be
           "adult" (i.e. porn) are not included in the result set. Set to true
           to allow unfiltered results.

           Standard precautions apply about how the "is adult?" determination
           is not perfect.

       Type
           This argument can be used to restrict the results to only a
           specific file type. The default value, "any", allows any type
           associated with the search space to be returned (that is, provides
           no restriction). Otherwise, the values allowed for "Type" depend on

       Language
           If provided, attempts to restrict the results to documents in the
           given language. The value is an language code such as "en"
           (English), "ja" (Japanese), etc (mostly ISO 639-1 codes). As of
           this writing, the following codes are supported:

            code  language
            ----  ---------
             sq   Albanian

             th   Thai
             tr   Turkish

           In addition, the code "default" is the same as the lack of a
           language specifier, and seems to mean a mix of major world
           languages, skewed toward English.

           The above list can be found in %Yahoo::Search::KnownLanguage.

           Because the list of languages may be updated more often than this
           Perl API, this Perl API does not attempt to restrict the "Language"
           value to members of this specific list. If you provide a "Language"
           value which is not supported by Yahoo!'s web services, a "400 Bad
           Request" error is returned in "@$".

       Sort
           For News searches, "sort" may be "rank" (the default) or "date".

           For Local searches, "sort" may be "relevance" (the default; most
           relevant first), "distance" (closest first), "rating" (highest
           rating first), or "title" (alphabetic sort).

       Color
           For Image searches, may be "any" (the default), "color", or "bw":

           "any"     No filtering based on colorization or lack thereof

           "color"   Only images with color are returned

           "bw"      Only black & white / grayscale images are returned

       Lat
       Long
       Street
       City
       State
       PostalCode
       Location
           These items are for a Local query, and specify the epicenter of the
           search. The epicenter must be provided in one of a variety of ways:

           •  via "Lat" and "Long"

           •  via the free-text "Location"

           •  via "Street" and "PostalCode"

           •  via "Street" and "City" and "State"

           •  via "PostalCode" alone

           •  via "City" and "State" alone.

           The list above is the order of precedence for when multiple fields
           are sent (e.g. if a "Lat" and "Long" are sent, they are used
           regardless of whether, say, a "PostalCode" is used), but it's
           probably best to send exactly only the fields you wish to be used.

           "Lat" and "Long" are floating point numbers, such as this example:

              Lat  =>  39.224079  # 39 deg 13 min 26.686 sec North
              Long => -98.541807, # 98 deg 32 min 30.506 sec West

           (which happens to be the location of the "Medes Ranch"
           triangulation station, upon which all country, state, etc.,
           boundaries in North America were originally based)

           "Street" is the street address, e.e. "701 First Ave". "PostalCode"
           is a US 5-digit or 9-digit ZIP code (e.g. "94089" or "94089-1234").

           If "Location" is provided, it supersedes the others. It should be a
           string along the lines of "701 First Ave, Sunnyvale CA, 94089". The
           following forms are recognized:

             city state
             city state zip
             zip
             street, city state
             street, city state zip
             street, zip

           Searches that include a street address (either in the "Location",
           or if "Location" is empty, in "Street") provide for a more detailed
           epicenter specification.

       Radius
           For Local searches, indicates how wide an area around the epicenter
           to search. The value is the radius of the search area, in miles.
           The default radius depends on the search location (urban areas tend
           to have a smaller default radius).

       AutoContinue
           A boolean (default off). If true, turns on the potentially
           dangerous auto-continuation, as described in the docs for
           "NextResult" in Yahoo::Search::Response.

       Debug
           "Debug" is a string (defaults to an empty string). If the substring
           ""url"" is found anywhere in the string, the url of the Yahoo!
           request is printed on stderr. If ""xml"", the raw xml received is
           printed to stderr.  If ""hash"", the raw Perl hash, as converted
           from the XML, is Data::Dump'd to stderr.

           Thus, to print all debugging, you'd set "Debug" to a value such as
           ""url xml hash"".

       PreRequestCallback
           This is for debugging (I needed it for my own regression-test
           script). If defined, it should be a code ref which accepts a single
           Yahoo::Search::Request object argument. It is called just before
           Yahoo!'s servers are contacted, and if it returns false, the call
           to Yahoo! is aborted (be sure to set $@).

Class Hierarchy Details
       The Y! Search API class system supports the following objects (all
       loaded as needed via Yahoo::Search):

         Yahoo::Search
         Yahoo::Search::Request
         Yahoo::Search::Response
         Yahoo::Search::Result

       Here is a summary of them:

       Yahoo::Search
                 A "search engine" object which can hold user-specified
                 default values for search-query arguments. Often not used
                 explicitly.

       Yahoo::Search::Request
                 An object which holds the information needed to make one
                 search-query request. Often not used explicitly.

       Yahoo::Search::Response
                 An object which holds the results of a query (including a
                 bunch of "Result" objects).

       Yahoo::Search::Result
                 An object representing one query result (one image, web page,
                 etc., as appropriate to the original search space).

"The Long Way", and Common Practice
       The explicit way to perform a query and access the results is to first
       create a "Search Engine" object:

         my $SearchEngine = Yahoo::Search->new();

       Optionally, you can provide "new" with key/value pairs as described in
       the Query arguments section above. Those values will then be available
       as default values during subsequent request creation. (More on this
       later.)

       You then use the search-engine object to create a request:

         my $Request = $SearchEngine->Request(Doc => Britney);

       You then actually make the request, getting a response:

         my $Response = $Request->Fetch();

       You can then access the set of "Result" objects in a number of ways,
       either all at once

         my @Results = $Response->Results();

       or iteratively:

         while (my $Result = $Response->NextResult) {
                      :
                      :
         }

       In Practice....

       In practice, one often does not need to go through all these steps
       explicitly. The only reason to create a search-engine object, for
       example, is to hold default overrides (to be made available to
       subsequent requests made via the search-engine object). For example:

          use Yahoo::Search;
          my $SearchEngine = Yahoo::Search->new(AppId      => "Bobs Fish Mart",
                                                Count      => 25,
                                                AllowAdult => 1,
                                                PostalCode => 95014);

       Now, calls to the various query functions ("Query", "Results") via this
       $SearchEngine will use these defaults (Image searches, for example,
       will be with "AllowAdult" set to true, and Local searches will be
       centered at ZIP code 95014.) All will return up to 25 results.

       In this example:

          my @Results = $SearchEngine->Results(Image => "Britney",
                                               Count => 20);

       The query is made with "AppId" as '"Bobs_Fish_Mart"' and "AllowAdult"
       true (both via $SearchEngine), but "Count" is 20 because explicit args
       override the default in $SearchEngine. The "PostalCode" arg does not
       apply too an Image search, so the default provided from "SearchEngine"
       is not needed with this particular query.

       Defaults on the 'use' line

       You can also provide the same defaults on the "use" line. The following
       example has the same result as the previous one:

          use Yahoo::Search AppId      => 'Bobs Fish Mart',
                            Count      => 25,
                            AllowAdult => 1,
                            PostalCode => 95014;

          my @Results = Yahoo::Search->Results(Image => "Britney",
                                               Count => 20);

Functions and Methods
       Here, finally, are the functions and methods provided by Yahoo::Search.
       In all cases, "...args..." are any of the key/value pairs listed in the
       Query arguments section of this document (e.g. "Count => 20")

       $SearchEngine = Yahoo::Search->new(...args...)
           Creates a search-engine object (a container for defaults).  On
           error, sets $@ and returns nothing.

       $Request = $SearchEngine->Request($space => $query, ...args...)
       $Request = Yahoo::Search->Request($space => $query, ...args...)
           Creates a "Request" object representing a search of the named
           search space (Doc, Image, etc.) of the given query string.

           On error, sets $@ and returns nothing.

           Note: all arguments are in key/value pairs, but the $space/$query
           pair (which is required) is required to appear first.

       $Response = $SearchEngine->Query($space => $query, ...args...)
       $Response = Yahoo::Search->Query($space => $query, ...args...)
           Creates an implicit "Request" object, and fetches it, returning the
           resulting "Response".

           On error, sets $@ and returns nothing.

           Note: all arguments are in key/value pairs, but the $space/$query
           pair (which is required) is required to appear first.

       @Results = $SearchEngine->Results($space => $query, ...args...)
       @Results = Yahoo::Search->Results($space => $query, ...args...)
           Creates an implicit "Request" object, then "Response" object, in
           the end returning a list of "Result" objects.

           On error, sets $@ and returns nothing.

           Note: all arguments are in key/value pairs, but the $space/$query
           pair (which is required) is required to appear first.

       @links = $SearchEngine->Links($space => $query, ...args...)
       @links = Yahoo::Search->Links($space => $query, ...args...)
           A super shortcut which goes directly from the query args to a list
           of

             <a href=...>...</a>

           links. Essentially,

               map { $_->Link } Yahoo::Search->Results($space => $query, ...args...);

           or, more explicitly:

               map { $_->Link } Yahoo::Search->new()->Request($space => $query, ...args...)->Fetch->Results(@_);

           See "Link" in the documentation for Yahoo::Search::Result.

           Note: all arguments are in key/value pairs, but the $space/$query
           pair (which is required) is required to appear first.

       @links = $SearchEngine->Terms($space => $query, ...args...)
       @links = Yahoo::Search->Terms($space => $query, ...args...)
           A super shortcut for Spell, Related, and Terms search spaces,
           returns the list of spelling suggestions, related-search
           suggestions, or important search terms, respectively.

           Note: all arguments are in key/value pairs, but the $space/$query
           pair (which is required) is required to appear first. For a Terms
           search, the $query may be "undef" (and in in any case, a Terms
           search requires a "Context" argument).

           For example,

              use Yahoo::Search AppId => "YahooDemo";
              for my $term (Yahoo::Search->Terms(Related => "Tivo")) {
                  print $term , "\n";
              }

           displays something along the lines of:

              directv tivo
              hd tivo
              tivo community
              tivo forum
              tivo upgrade
              tivo rebate
              dvd recorder tivo
              direct tv tivo
              tivo to go
              hdtv tivo

           Here's an example with the Terms search space:

              use Yahoo::Search AppId => "YahooDemo";

              my $Context = << '*END*';
              We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect
              Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the
              common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of
              Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this
              Constitution for the United States of America.
              *END*

              for my $term (Yahoo::Search->Terms(Terms => undef, Context => $Context)) {
                  print $term, "\n";
              }

           displays something along the lines of:

             insure domestic tranquility
             promote the general welfare
             domestic tranquility
             united states
             states of america
             united states of america
             posterity
             blessings
             constitution
             perfect union

           Note that a Spell search returns at most one term.

       @html = $SearchEngine->HtmlResults($space => $query, ...args...)
       @html = Yahoo::Search->HtmlResults($space => $query, ...args...)
           Like "Links", but returns a list of html strings (one representing
           each result). See "as_html" in the documentation for
           Yahoo::Search::Result.

           A simple result display might look like

              print join "<p>", Yahoo::Search->HtmlResults(....);

           or, perhaps

              if (my @HTML = Yahoo::Search->HtmlResults(....))
              {
                 print "<ul>";
                 for my $html (@HTML) {
                    print "<li>", $html;
                 }
                 print "</ul>";
              }

           As an example, here's a complete CGI which shows results from an
           image-search, where the search term is in the '"s"' query string:

              #!/usr/local/bin/perl -w
              use CGI;
              my $cgi = new CGI;
              print $cgi->header();

              use Yahoo::Search AppId => 'my-search-app';
              if (my $term = $cgi->param('s')) {
                  print join "<p>", Yahoo::Search->HtmlResults(Image => $term);
              }

           The results, however, do look better with some style-sheet
           attention, such as:

             <style>
               .yResult { display: block; border: #CCF 3px solid ; padding:10px }
               .yLink   { }
               .yTitle  { display:none }
               .yImg    { border: solid 1px }
               .yUrl    { display:none }
               .yMeta   { font-size: 80% }
               .ySrcUrl { }
               .ySum    { font-family: arial; font-size: 90% }
             </style>

           Note: all arguments are in key/value pairs, but the $space/$query
           pair (which is required) is required to appear first.

       $num = $SearchEngine->MaxCount($space)
       $num = Yahoo::Search->MaxCount($space)
           Returns the assumed maximum allowed "Count" query-argument for the
           given search space.  The amount may be out of date.

       $SearchEngine->Default($key [ => $val ]);
           If a new value is given, update the <$SearchEngine>'s value for the
           named $key.

           In either case, the old value for $key in effect is returned. If
           the $SearchEngine had a previous value, it is returned. Otherwise,
           the global value in effect is returned.

           As always, the key is from among those mentioned in the Query
           arguments section above.

           The old value is returned.

       Yahoo::Search->Default($key [ => $val ]);
           Update or, if no new value is given, check the global default value
           for the named argument. The key is from among those mentioned in
           the Query examples section above, as well as "AutoCarp" (discussed
           below).

Defaults and Default Overrides
       All key/value pairs mentioned in the Query arguments section may appear
       on the "use" line, in the call to the "new" constructor, or in requests
       that create a query explicitly or implicitly ("Request", "Query",
       "Results", "Links", or "HtmlResults").

       Each argument's value takes the first of the following which applies
       (listed in order of precedence):

       4)    The actual arguments to a function which creates (explicitly or
             implicitly) a request.

       3)    Search-engine default overrides, set when the Yahoo::Search "new"
             constructor is used to create a search-engine object, or when
             that object's "Default" method is called.

       2)    Global default overrides, set on the "use" line or via

              Yahoo::Search->Default()

       1)    Defaults hard-coded into these packages (e.g. "Count" defaults to
             10).

       It's particularly convenient to put the "AppId" on the "use" line, e.g.

          use Yahoo::Search AppId => 'just testing';

AutoCarp
       By default, detected errors that would be classified as programming
       errors (e.g. use of incorrect args) are automatically spit out to
       stderr besides being returned via $@. This can be turned off via

         use Yahoo::Search AutoCarp => 0;

       or

        Yahoo::Search->Default(AutoCarp => 0);

       The default of true is somewhat obnoxious, but hopefully helps create
       better programs by forcing the programmer to actively think about error
       checking (if even long enough to turn off error reporting).

Global Variables
       The following are globally available:

       %Yahoo::Search::KnownCountry
            A hash with the known (as of this writing) country codes supported
            by Yahoo! for the "Country" argument.

       %Yahoo::Search::KnownLanguage
            A hash with the known (as of this writing) language codes
            supported by Yahoo! for the "Language" argument.

       $Yahoo::Search::RecentRequestUrl
            The most recent REST url actually fetched from Yahoo! (perhaps
            useful for debugging). It does not reflect the fact that a request
            is changed to a POST when request is sufficiently large. Thus,
            there are times when the url on $Yahoo::Search::RecentRequestUrl
            is not actually fetchable from the Yahoo! servers.

       $Yahoo::Search::UseXmlSimple
            If you set this to a true value, the XML returned by Yahoo! will
            be parsed with XML::Simple (if installed on your system) rather
            than with Yahoo::Search::XML, a simple XML parser included as part
            of this package.  XML::Simple uses XML::Parser under the hood, and
            at least on the systems I've tested it, XML::Parser suffers from a
            crippling memory leak that makes it very undesirable.

            However, if Yahoo! changes the XML they return in a way that my
            simple parser can't handle, it tries parsing it with XML::Simple.
            If XML::Simple is installed and can parse the XML,
            $Yahoo::Search::UseXmlSimple is automatically set to true and a
            warning generated suggesting that a bug report be filed for
            Yahoo::Search::XML.

            If you encounter a situation where Yahoo::Search::XML can't grok
            Yahoo!'s XML, please submit a bug report. In the mean time, you
            can ensure that XML::Simple is installed, set
            $Yahoo::Search::UseXmlSimple, and at least have things work until
            you run out of memory.

            The default value of $Yahoo::Search::UseXmlSimple is taken from
            the environment variable "YAHOO_SEARCH_XMLSIMPLE" if present, and
            otherwise defaults to false.

       $Yahoo::Search::Version
            A string in "X.Y.Z" format. The first number, the major version,
            increments with large and/or backwards major incompatible changes.
            The second number (minor version) updates with notable feature
            additions/changes. The third number updates with every new release
            (and is the only one updated for small bug- and typo fix
            releases).

Environment
       If "YAHOO_SEARCH_XMLSIMPLE" is set to a true (nonempty, non-"0") value,
       $Yahoo::Search::UseXmlSimple defaults to true. See above.

       Yahoo::Search uses LWP to communicate with Yahoo!'s servers; LWP uses
       environment variables such as "http_proxy" and "no_proxy". See the
       perldoc for LWP for more.
