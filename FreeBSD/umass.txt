UMASS(4)               FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual               UMASS(4)

NAME
     umass – USB Mass Storage Devices driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following line in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device scbus
           device usb
           device umass

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           umass_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The umass driver provides support for Mass Storage devices that attach to
     the USB port.

     To use the umass driver, usb(4) and one of uhci(4) or ohci(4) or ehci(4)
     or xhci(4) must be configured in the kernel.  Additionally, since umass
     uses the SCSI subsystem and sometimes acts as a SCSI device, it requires
     da(4) and scbus(4) to be included in the kernel.

EXAMPLES
           device umass
           device scbus
           device da
           device pass

     Add the umass driver to the kernel.

           camcontrol rescan 0:0:3

     Rescan all slots on a multi-slot flash reader, where the slots map to
     separate LUNs on a single SCSI ID.  Typically only the first slot will be
     enabled at boot time.  This assumes that the flash reader is the first
     SCSI bus in the system and has 4 slots.
