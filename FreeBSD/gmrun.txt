NAME
       gmrun - Featureful CLI-like GTK+ application launcher

SYNOPSIS
       gmrun [TEXT]

DESCRIPTION
       gmrun is a GTK program that allows a user to use a CLI-like interface
       to launch applications.

OPTIONS
       If gmrun is invoked with a command-line parameter, that will be the
       initial content of the dialog box.

       gmrun can be customized using a configuration file, ~/.gmrunrc . The
       system-wide configuration file is /etc/gmrunrc .

       The format of the configuration file is simple; "variable = value".

       Example:
              variable1 = foobar

       Terminal
              The command to run when Ctrl+Enter is pressed with no command
              entered; used to start a new terminal.

       TermExec
              The command to run when Ctrl+Enter is pressed with a command
              entered. The entered command is supplied as an argument to
              TermExec.

       Geometry
              see /etc/gmrunrc for more info

       History
              Number of entered commands which should be kept in gmrun's
              history(~/.gmrun_history). Using the Up and Down arrow keys
              within the gmrun window will cycle through the history. You can
              search backwards through the history with Ctrl+R, and forward
              with Ctrl+S. Hit "!" to enter a special search that matches only
              the start of strings. To cancel a search, hit the ESC key.
              Otherwise, after you have found the history item you wish to
              run, hit Enter. Also: CTRL-P = Up / CTRL-N = Down.

       ShowLast
              Whether to show the last command as initial text, or an empty
              textarea (1 or 0).

       Selected
              Whether the initial text should be selected or not (1 or 0).

URL/File HANDLING
       USE_GLIB_XDG = 1
              For automatic URL and File handling using the freedesktop
              specification.

       See /etc/gmrunrc for custom URL and extension handlers (USE_GLIB_XDG =
       0)

       The included configuration files have a few examples which you can work
       with. You should also note that the protocol part of URL_protocol can
       be *anything*. You can set up "URL_foobarbazcustom", and so long as you
       enter in "foobarbazcustom:<whatever>", it will use the given program.
