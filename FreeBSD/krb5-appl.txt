RSH(1)                  FreeBSD General Commands Manual                 RSH(1)



NAME
       rsh - remote shell

SYNOPSIS
       rsh host [-l username] [-n] [-d] [-k realm] [-f | -F] [-x] [-PN | -PO]
       command

DESCRIPTION
       Rsh connects to the specified host, and executes the specified command.
       Rsh copies its standard input to the remote command, the standard
       output of the remote command to its standard output, and the standard
       error of the remote command to its standard error.  This implementation
       of rsh will accept any port for the standard error stream.  Interrupt,
       quit and terminate signals are propagated to the remote command; rsh
       normally terminates when the remote command does.

       Each user may have a private authorization list in a file .k5login in
       his login directory.  Each line in this file should contain a Kerberos
       principal name of the form principal/instance@realm.  If there is a
       ~/.k5login file, then access is granted to the account if and only if
       the originater user is authenticated to one of the princiapls named in
       the ~/.k5login file.  Otherwise, the originating user will be granted
       access to the account if and only if the authenticated principal name
       of the user can be mapped to the local account name using the aname ->
       lname mapping rules (see krb5_anadd(8) for more details).

OPTIONS
       -l username
              sets the remote username to username.  Otherwise, the remote
              username will be the same as the local username.

       -x     causes the network session traffic to be encrypted.  This
              applies only to the input and output streams, and not the
              command line.

       -f     cause nonforwardable Kerberos credentials to be forwarded to the
              remote machine for use by the specified command.  They will be
              removed when command finishes.  This option is mutually
              exclusive with the -F option.

       -F     cause forwardable Kerberos credentials to be forwarded to the
              remote machine for use by the specified command.  They will be
              removed when command finishes.  This option is mutually
              exclusive with the -f option.

       -k realm
              causes rsh to obtain tickets for the remote host in realm
              instead of the remote host's realm as determined by
              krb_realmofhost(3).

       -d     turns on socket debugging (via setsockopt(2)) on the TCP sockets
              used for communication with the remote host.

       -n     redirects input from the special device /dev/null (see the BUGS
              section below).

       -PN

       -PO    Explicitly request new or old version of the Kerberos ``rcmd''
              protocol.  The new protocol avoids many security problems found
              in the old one, but is not interoperable with older servers.
              (An "input/output error" and a closed connection is the most
              likely result of attempting this combination.)  If neither
              option is specified, some simple heuristics are used to guess
              which to try.

       If you omit command, then instead of executing a single command, you
       will be logged in on the remote host using rlogin(1).

       Shell metacharacters which are not quoted are interpreted on the local
       machine, while quoted metacharacters are interpreted on the remote
       machine.  Thus the command

          rsh otherhost cat remotefile >> localfile

       appends the remote file remotefile to the local file localfile, while

          rsh otherhost cat remotefile ">>" otherremotefile

       appends remotefile to otherremotefile.

FILES
       /etc/hosts
       ~/.k5login  (on remote host) - file containing Kerberos principals that
                   are allowed access.

SEE ALSO
       rlogin(1), kerberos(3), krb_sendauth(3), krb_realmofhost(3), kshd(8)

BUGS
       If you are using csh(1) and put a rsh(1) in the background without
       redirecting its input away from the terminal, it will block even if no
       reads are posted by the remote command.  If no input is desired you
       should redirect the input of rsh to /dev/null using the -n option.

       You cannot run an interactive command (like rogue(6) or vi(1)); use
       rlogin(1).

       Stop signals stop the local rsh process only; this is arguably wrong,
       but currently hard to fix for reasons too complicated to explain here.
