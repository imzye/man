ZPOOL-CLEAR(8)          FreeBSD System Manager's Manual         ZPOOL-CLEAR(8)

NAME
     zpool-clear – clear device errors in ZFS storage pool

SYNOPSIS
     zpool clear pool [device]…

DESCRIPTION
     Clears device errors in a pool.  If no arguments are specified, all
     device errors within the pool are cleared.  If one or more devices is
     specified, only those errors associated with the specified device or
     devices are cleared.

     If the pool was suspended it will be brought back online provided the
     devices can be accessed.  Pools with multihost enabled which have been
     suspended cannot be resumed.  While the pool was suspended, it may have
     been imported on another host, and resuming I/O could result in pool
     damage.
