XMAILWATCHER(1)         FreeBSD General Commands Manual        XMAILWATCHER(1)

NAME
       xmailwatcher -- periodically check for mail

SYNOPSIS
       xmailwatcher [-toolkitoption ...] [-option ...]

DESCRIPTION
       xmailwatcher checks the user's mailbox periodically.  If there is new
       mail, or optionally if there is any mail at all, the user is notified.
       Two methods of display are used: if the application is in the iconic
       state the icon window displays a nomail or mail bitmap, with foreground
       and background values inverted by default in the latter case; if the
       application is non-iconic a list of senders and subjects is displayed,
       with a vertical scrollbar if necessary.

       xmailwatcher will attempt to decode RFC 1522 Q-encoded headers,
       provided a suitable ISO8859 font is being used.  Due to limitations of
       the Label widget used to display the list of messages, each instance of
       xmailwatcher is able to decode only one class of ISO8859-n encoding
       (the default is ISO8859-1).

       xmailwatcher understands both sendmail and MMDF formats of mailbox
       automatically.

OPTIONS
       xmailwatcher accepts all of the standard toolkit command line options.
       In addition, the following are accepted:

       -allmail (or -allMail)
               Report whenever there is any mail in the mailbox.  By default
               only new mail is reported.  Sets the .newMail application
               resource to False.

       -doMime (and -noMime)
               Controls whether RFC1522 should be decoded or not.  The default
               is to attempt to decode.

       -icongeometry geometryspec (or -iconGeometry)
               Specifies the geometry for the icon window.  Sets the
               .iconShell.geometry resource.

       -mailbox mailboxname
               Specifies the name of the mailbox to be polled (defaults to
               .mail in the user's current directory).  Sets the .mailbox
               application resource.

       -newmail (or -newMail)
               Report only new mail in the mailbox (the default).  Sets the
               .newMail application resource to True.

       -poll pollinterval
               Specifies the interval in seconds between successive mailbox
               checks (defaults to 67 seconds).  Sets the .pollInterval
               application resource.

       -silent Don't ring the bell when new mail arrives.  Sets the .silent
               application resource to True.

       -soundfile soundFileName (or -soundFile)
               If on a Sun-4, attempt to copy soundFileName to /dev/audio
               instead of ringing the bell.  NOTE that the audio device on the
               client host is used, not the server host, so you don't want to
               do this if you're using an X-terminal.  Sets the .soundFile
               application resource.

WIDGET HIERARCHY
       xmailwatcher has the following widget hierarchy:

            MailWatcher xmailwatcher
                 Viewport viewport
                      Label messages
                 TransientShell iconShell
                      Label icon

X DEFAULTS
       In addition to the usual resources and classes used by the widgets in
       its hierarchy, xmailwatcher understands the following application
       resources:

       bellVolume (class BellVolume)
               Specifies the volume with which the bell should be rung when
               mail arrives (default zero).  See the Xlib documentation for
               details.

       bufferSize (class BufferSize)
               Defines the size of the buffer used to hold the sender/subject
               details (default 8K).

       doMime (class DoMime)
               If True (the default) attempt to decode RFC1522 Q-encoding.

       fullNames (class FullNames)
               If True, display the full text of the "From:" header.  If False
               (the default), attempt to extract the sender's real name from
               the "From:" header.

       iconBackground (class Background)
               Specifies the background colour of the nomail icon and the
               default foreground colour of the mail icon.

       iconForeground (class Foreground)
               Specifies the foreground colour of the nomail icon and the
               default background colour of the mail icon.

       iconMailBackground (default iconForeground)
               Specifies the background colour of the mail icon.

       iconMailForeground (default iconBackground)
               Specifies the foreground colour of the mail icon.

       mailBitmap (classMailBitmap)
               Specifies the name of a bitmap to display in the icon window
               when mail has arrived (defaults to letters).  The Xmu string-
               to-bitmap converter is registered to handle this resource.

       mailbox (class Mailbox)
               Specifies the name of the mailbox to be polled (defaults to
               .mail in the user's current directory).

       newMail (class NewMail)
               If True (the default) the user is only informed of new mail.
               If False the user is informed whenever there is any mail in the
               mailbox.  In the latter case if the application is iconic then
               a complete parse of the mailbox is unnecessary; if it is of
               non-zero size, the parse is deferred until the application is
               de-iconified.

       nomailBitmap (class NomailBitmap)
               Specifies the name of a bitmap to display in the icon window
               when no mail has arrived (defaults to noletters).  The Xmu
               string-to-bitmap converter is registered to handle this
               resource.

       pollInterval (class PollInterval)
               Specifies the interval in seconds between successive mailbox
               checks (defaults to 67 seconds).

       setTitle (class SetTitle)
               If True (the default), sets the main window's title, as
               displayed by the window manager, to indicate when the mailbox
               was last altered.  If False, leaves the title unchanged.

       silent (class Silent)
               If True don't ring the bell when new mail arrives.

       soundFile (class SoundFile)
               If on a Sun-4, the name of a file to copy to /dev/audio when
               new mail arrives.  NOTE that this takes place on the client
               host, not the server host.
