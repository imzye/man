MERGE-INFO(1)                XStow Reference Guide               MERGE-INFO(1)


NAME
       merge-info, merge and unmerge GNU Info index files

SYNOPSIS
       merge-info        [OPTION ...] FILE FILE

DESCRIPTION
       merge-info can merge and unmerge the GNU Info index files named 'dir'.
       These files are usally created by install-info at install time of an
       application, or automatically generated by a mkinfodir script.

       If you are installing 2 packages at two different locations, two
       different 'dir' files are created. Eg.: One in

                 /stow/foo/usr/local/info/dir

       and one in

                 /stow/bar/usr/local/info/dir

       This is the common case if you are using a tool like xstow(1). merge-
       info can handle this and can merge both 'dir' files and creates a new
       'dir' file.

USAGE
       merge-info [OPTION ...] FILE FILE

       Merge two files:

             merge-info /stow/foo/info/dir /stow/bar/info/dir

       Remove the content of a 'dir' file from another 'dir' file

              merge-info -u /stow/foo/info/dir /stow/bar/info/dir

OPTIONS
       -dl -debug-level INT
           Set's the debug level. An unsigned integer is accepted. The default
           value is 0.

       -h -help
           Shows a help screen.

       -V -Version
           Displays the verion number of the XStow package. merge-info is
           shipped with xstow(1).

       -C -no-curses
           Do not detect the terminal width by using curses.

       -u -unmerge
           Unmerge instead of merge. Note: It is not possible splitting up one
           'dir' file into two. But removing the content of one 'dir' file
           from the other one is possible.

       -o -outfile
           Write the resulting 'dir' file not to stdout. Write it to a given
           file. Since merge-info does not open this outfile until all the
           merging or unmerging stuff is done it is allowed that the outfile
           is one the source files. eg.:

               merge-info -u foo/info/dir bar/info/dir -o foo/info/dir

       -d -duplicate
           Remove duplicate entries. When merging 2 files an entry can appear
           in more than one section. If you do not wan't this, use this
           option.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       XSTOW_DEBUG_LEVEL
           Same as the -debug-level option.

       XSTOW_USE_CURSES
           Same as the -no-curses option.

           In previous versions xstow tried detecting the terminal width and
           height, by default at the startup routine. Even if this value is
           only used by the help screen. The result was:

               $ TERM="" xstow
               Error opening terminal: unknown.

           The error message is reported by the ncurses lib. This can cause
           problems if you wan't start xstow as a cron job.  Now xstow tries
           detecting the terminal width not in it's startup, but when the help
           screen is printed out. As an extra option you can set the
           environment variable XSTOW_USE_CURSES="0" this will tell xstow not
           using curses anyway.

           merge-info has the same behaviour.
