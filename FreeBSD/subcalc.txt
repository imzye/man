DESCRIPTION
     The subcalc utility is used for subnet calculation and IPv6 DNS PTR
     record generation.  subcalc takes command line arguments in a similar
     format to ifconfig(8) so the synopsis should be familiar to the user.
     Given an address family, address and a netmask/prefix length, subcalc
     will calculate the number of hosts and address ranges of the specific
     network. Specifying the ``print'' option to to the end of the command
     line will result in every single network address for the specified
     network being printed to stdout.

     subcalc was designed for network engineers which setup fine grained
     firewalls, packet filters, access control lists and network subdivisions
     for both IP and IPv6 servers and networks.

     The following options are available:

     address_family
             Specify the address family which affects interpretation of the
             remaining parameters.  Since subcalc can handle subnet
             calculations in different protocols with different naming
             schemes, specifying the address family is recommended.  The
             address or protocol families currently supported are “inet” and
             “inet6”.

     address
             For the DARPA-Internet family, the address is an Internet address
             expressed in the Internet standard “dot notation”.

             It is also possible to use the CIDR notation (also known as the
             slash notation) to include the netmask.  That is, one can specify
             an address like 192.168.0.1/16.

             For “inet6” family, it is also possible to specify the prefix
             length using the slash notation, like ::1/128.  See the prefixlen
             parameter below for more information.

     arpa6 address
             Generate an ARPA6 PTR record which the popular DNS server
             ``BIND'' will understand. In order for the components of the PTR
             record to be complete, a hostname must be specified as well.

     hosts number
             Specify the number of nodes or addresses on a network and subcalc
             will calculate an appropriate network subdivision and bits. This
             is used for netmask discovery. NOTE: currently subcalc calculates
             the subdivision for one network. In some cases it may be more
             efficient to use more then one network subdivision.

     int6 address
             Generate an INT6 PTR record which the popular DNS server ``BIND''
             will understand. In order for the components of the PTR record to
             be complete, a hostname must be specified as well.

     mask ciscomask
             Specify the netmask in the format expected on Cisco routers. That
             is the inverted form of a netmask. For example, the netmask
             255.255.255.0 would be represented as 0.0.0.255. This option is
             only applicable for IPv4, as on Cisco routers, CIDR notation is
             used to specify IPv6 network addresses.

     netmask mask
             Specify how much of the address to reserve for subdividing
             networks into sub-networks.  The mask includes the network part
             of the local address and the subnet part, which is taken from the
             host field of the address.  The mask can be specified as a single
             hexadecimal number with a leading ‘0x’, or with a dot-notation
             Internet address.  The mask contains 1's for the bit positions in
             the 32-bit address which are to be used for the network and
             subnet parts, and 0's for the host part.  The mask should contain
             at least the standard network portion, and the subnet field
             should be contiguous with the network portion.

             The netmask can also be specified in CIDR notation after the
             address.  See the address option above for more information.

     prefixlen len
             Specify that len bits are reserved for subdividing networks into
             sub-networks.  The len must be an integer, and for syntactical
             reason it must be between 0 to 128.  It is almost always 64 under
             the current IPv6 assignment rule.  If the parameter is omitted,
             64 is used.

             The prefix can also be specified using the slash notation after
             the address.  See the address option above for more information

     print   causes each address in the specified network to be printed to
             stdout, one address per line.  Regular subnet calculation is
             still performed, however each line of the standard calculation
             output is prefixed by a ``;'' character. This makes it easy for
             standard subnet calculations to be filtered out, in the event
             that network lists need to be generated.

     stf     If the address family is inet, translate the argument as an IPv4
             address which will be converted into the arbitrary IPv6 ``/48''
             (6to4 rfc3056) network designation. If the family is inet6,
             translate the argument as an IPv6 network or address
             specification which will be converted into it's arbitrary IPv4
             parent address.

EXAMPLES
     To calculate the network range, number of hosts, prefixlen or CIDR and
     netmask for the 10.0.0.1/24 (255.255.255.0) network.

           % subcalc inet 10.0.0.1/24

     Anyone of the following will achieve the exact same thing:

           % subcalc inet 10.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0
           % subcalc inet 10.0.0.1 netmask 0xffffff00
           % subcalc inet 10.0.0.1 prefixlen 24
           % subcalc inet 10.0.0.1 mask 0.0.0.255

     To generate a list of nodes for the specified network one could use
     anyone of the following methods:

           % subcalc inet 10.0.0.1/24 print
           % subcalc inet 10.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 print
           % subcalc inet 10.0.0.1 netmask 0xffffff00 print
           % subcalc inet 10.0.0.1 prefixlen 24 print

     Arbitrarily, the same thing can be done for IPv6. To calculate the
     network range, number of hosts, prefixlen etc for the
     3ffe:beef:13e1:4c92::cd90/48 network, one could use any of the following:

           % subcalc inet6 3ffe:beef:13e1:4c92::cd90/48
           % subcalc inet6 3ffe:beef:13e1:4c92::cd90 netmask ffff:ffff:ffff::
           % subcalc inet6 3ffe:beef:13e1:4c92::cd90 prefixlen 48

     Likewise for printing each node of a network:

           % subcalc inet6 3ffe:beef:13e1:4c92::cd90/48 print
           % subcalc inet6 3ffe:beef:13e1:4c92::cd90 prefixlen 48 print

     IP version 4 PTR records (records which map an address to a canonical
     name) contain a portion which has a reversed version of the IP octet
     prefixing the in-addr.arpa. zone.  For example, an RFC 1035 PTR record
     for 10.0.0.1 would look like:

           1.0.0.10.in-addr.arpa. IN PTR canonical.name.org.

     The first section of this PTR record is called the ``owner'':

           1.0.0.10.in-addr.arpa.

     For IP version 6, rather then reversing each octet, PTR records require
     that each ``nibble'' or 4 bit address subdivision be reversed. For
     example, the owner section of a PTR record for the IPv6 address
     3ffe:beef:13e1:4c92::cd90 would be:

           0.9.d.c.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.2.9.c.4.1.e.3.1.f.e.e.b.e.f.f.3.ip6.arpa.

     Creating PTR record for IP version 6 addresses can be tedious and more
     prone to error.  subcalc has the capability to automatically subdivide
     the IPv6 address into nibbles and reverse them into a PTR record like
     format. An example on how this might be achieved is:

           % subcalc arpa6 3ffe:beef:13e1:4c92::cd90 canonical.name.org.
           % subcalc int6 3ffe:beef:13e1:4c92::cd90 canonical.name.org.

     If you wanted to calculate a subdivision for a network given the number
     of nodes or hosts, you could do:

           % subcalc inet hosts 23

     The next highest network subdivision in this case would be a ``/27''
     which has 32 hosts. The netmask for this network would be:
     255.255.255.224.

     Given an IPv4 address, figure out the 6to4 IPv6 ``/48'' network
     associated with it.

           % subcalc stf inet 204.55.55.1

     Given an IPv6 network or address, figure out what IPv4 address represents
     the parent for the network.

           % subcalc stf inet6 2002:cc37:3701::/48
           % subcalc stf inet6 2002:cc37:3701:bc38::4081
