S5(1)                   FreeBSD General Commands Manual                  S5(1)

NAME
     s5 – set up and update S5 presentations

SYNOPSIS
     s5 [-Nv] [-T template] blank path
     s5 [-Nv] [-T template] cksum path
     s5 [-Nv] [-T template] mksum path
     s5 [-Nv] [-T template] update path

     s5 -h
     s5 help

DESCRIPTION
     The s5 tool eases the creation of presentation slides using the “Simple
     Standards-based Slide Show System”.  It may be used to create a working
     copy of a template directory or, later, to update the working copy after
     the template has changed over time.

     The s5 tool supports the following command-line options:

     -h      Display a short help text and exit.

     -N      No-operation mode; just display the commands without executing
             them.

     -T template
             Specify the template directory instead of the default
             /usr/local/share/s5/s5-blank

     -v      Verbose operation; display diagnostic information.

     The s5 tool supports the following actions:

     blank path
             Aliases: create, new

             Copy the template directory into the directory specified by path,
             creating it if necessary.

     cksum path
             Aliases: check, verify

             Verify the checksums recorded for the S5 presentation files in
             the directory specified by path.  The s5 utility reports both
             files that have been modified (fail the checksum check) and files
             that no longer exist yet have checksums recorded.

     help    Alias: usage

             Display a short help message and exit.

     mksum path
             Record the template checksums into a file in a directory
             specified by path.  Users should never really have to execute
             this by hand, since it is done internally as part of the blank
             and update command processing.

     update path
             Update the S5 presentation files in the directory specified by
             path with the new versions in the S5 template directory.

             Before updating, the s5 utility verifies the checksums of the
             files in the path directory, and terminates if a mismatch is
             found.  After that, s5 checks for any files that exist in both
             the new template and in the path directory, but are not recorded
             in the checksum file (i.e. have been placed in path by hand after
             the last s5 blank or s5 update run) and terminates if any such
             files differ.

             If all these checks are successful, the s5 utility copies the
             template files over those in path, overwriting any existing files
             and retaining any files that do not exist in the template
             directory.

FILES
     The s5 utility stores the checksums of blank S5 presentations into a file
     named s5-checksums.txt into the presentation directory.  This is a simple
     text file with lines containing of a keyword and values.  The keywords
     that the s5 utility currently generates and parses are as follows:

     CKSUM_CMD checksum-program
             The name of the checksum program to use; the default is cksum(1).

     CKSUM_ARGS [[argument...]]
             The arguments (if any) passed to the checksum program as defined
             by the CKSUM_CMD line.  The default is an empty string, no
             arguments passed.

     FILE filename
             The name of the file that the following CKSUM line refers to.

     CKSUM checksum-line-text
             The output of the checksum command as specified by CKSUM_CMD and
             CKSUM_ARGS conflated into a single line.

EXAMPLES
     Start a brand new presentation:

           s5 blank ~/txt/openfest/2006/gnupg

     Verify if any of the S5 files in the presentation have been modified:

           s5 cksum gnupg/

     Do the same, but display verbose information about the lines read from
     the checksums file and the files verified:

           s5 -v cksum gnupg/

     Update the S5 presentation files after installing a new system-wide
     version of the S5 template:

           s5 update gnupg/

     Store the checksums of the S5 template files (not the real files in the
     presentation directory!) into the s5-checksums.txt file in the gnupg/
     directory; this is actually redundant, as it is done as part of the s5
     blank invocation:

           s5 mksum gnupg/
