NSMB.CONF(5)              FreeBSD File Formats Manual             NSMB.CONF(5)

NAME
     nsmb.conf – configuration file for SMB requests

DESCRIPTION
     The nsmb.conf file contains information about the computers, users, and
     shares or mount points for the SMB network protocol.

     The configuration files are loaded in the following order:

           1. ~/.nsmbrc
           2. /etc/nsmb.conf

     As a result, /etc/nsmb.conf settings override those in ~/.nsmbrc.

     The configuration hierarchy is made up of several sections, each section
     containing a few or several lines of parameters and their assigned
     values.  Each of these sections must begin with a section name enclosed
     within square brackets, similar to:

           [section_name]

     The end of each section is marked by either the start of a new section,
     or by the abrupt ending of the file, commonly referred to as the EOF.
     Each section may contain zero or more parameters such as:

           [section_name]
           key=value

     where key represents a parameter name, and value would be the parameter's
     assigned value.

     The SMB library uses the following information for section names:

     A)      [default]
     B)      [SERVER]
     C)      [SERVER:USER]
     D)      [SERVER:USER:SHARE]

     Possible keywords may include:

     Keyword            Section        Comment
                        A B C D
     addr               - + - -        IP address of SMB server
     charsets           - + + +        local:remote charset pair
     nbns               + + - -        address of NetBIOS name server (WINS)
     nbscope            + + - -        NetBIOS scope
     nbtimeout          + + - -        timeout for NetBIOS name servers
     password           - - + +        plain text or simple encrypted password
                                       used to access the given share
     retry_count        + + - -        number of retries before connection is
                                       marked as broken
     timeout            + + - -        SMB request timeout
     workgroup          + + + +        workgroup name

FILES
     /etc/nsmb.conf      The default remote mount-point configuration file.

     ~/.nsmbrc           The user specific remote mount-point configuration
                         file.

EXAMPLES
     What follows is a sample configuration file which may, or may not match
     your environment:

           # Configuration file for example.com
           [default]
           workgroup=SALES
           # The 'FSERVER' is an NT server.
           [FSERVER]
           charsets=koi8-r:cp866
           addr=fserv.example.com
           # User specific data for FSERVER
           [FSERVER:MYUSER]
           password=$$16144562c293a0314e6e1

     All lines which begin with the ‘#’ character are comments and will not be
     parsed.  The “default” section describes the default workgroup or domain,
     in this case “SALES”.  The next section depicted here as “FSERVER”,
     defines a server section and then assigns it a charset which is only
     required when Cyrillic characters are not used.  The hostname value,
     “fserv.example.com”, is also assigned in this section.  “FSERVER:USER”,
     defines the user settings and is useful for saving the password used
     during a specific connection.  The password may be plaintext or
     obfuscated using simple encryption.  The simple encrypted password starts
     with the `$$1' symbols.  Warning: the encryption function is very weak
     and intended only to hide clear text passwords.  If the use of simple
     encryption is desired, the following command may be used on a password:

           smbutil crypt
