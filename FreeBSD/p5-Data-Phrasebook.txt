NAME
       Data::Phrasebook - Abstract your queries!

SYNOPSIS
           use Data::Phrasebook;

           my $q = Data::Phrasebook->new(
               class  => 'Plain',
               loader => 'Text',
               file   => 'phrases.txt',
           );

           # simple keyword to phrase mapping
           my $phrase = $q->fetch($keyword);

           # keyword to phrase mapping with parameters
           $q->delimiters( qr{ \[% \s* (\w+) \s* %\] }x );
           my $phrase = $q->fetch($keyword,{this => 'that'});

DESCRIPTION
       Data::Phrasebook is a collection of modules for accessing phrasebooks
       from various data sources.

PHRASEBOOKS
       To explain what phrasebooks are it is worth reading Rani Pinchuk's
       (author of Class::Phrasebook) article on Perl.com:

       <http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2002/10/22/phrasebook.html>

       Common uses of phrasebooks are in handling error codes, accessing
       databases via SQL queries and written language phrases. Examples are
       the mime.types file and the hosts file, both of which use a simple
       phrasebook design.

       Unfortunately Class::Phrasebook is a complete work and not a true class
       based framework. If you can't install XML libraries, you cannot use it.
       This distribution is a collaboration between Iain Truskett and myself
       to create an extendable and class based framework for implementing
       phrasebooks.

CLASSES
       In creating a phrasebook object, a class type is required. This class
       defines the nature of the phrasebook or the behaviours associated with
       it. Currently there are two classes, Plain and SQL.

       The Plain class is the default class, and allows retrieval of phrases
       via the fetch() method. The fetch() simply returns the phrase that maps
       to the given keyword.

       The SQL class allows specific database handling. Phrases are retrieved
       via the query() method. The query() method internally retrieves the SQL
       phrase, then returns the statement handler object, which the user can
       then perform a prepare/execute/fetch/finish sequence on. For more
       details see Data::Phrasebook::SQL.

CONSTRUCTOR
   new
       The arguments to new depend upon the exact class you're creating.

       The default class is "Plain" and only requires the Loader arguments.
       The "SQL" class requires a database handle as well as the Loader
       arguments.

       The "class" argument defines the object class of the phrasebook and the
       behaviours that can be associated with it. Using "Foobar" as a fake
       class, the class module is searched for in the following order:

       1.  If you've subclassed "Data::Phrasebook", for example as
           "Dictionary", then "Dictionary::Foobar" is tried.

       2.  If that failed, "Data::Phrasebook::Foobar" is tried.

       3.  If that failed, "Foobar" is tried.

       4.  If all the above failed, we croak.

       This should allow you some flexibility in what sort of classes you use
       while not having you type too much.

       For other parameters, see the specific class you wish to instantiate.
       The class argument is removed from the arguments list and the "new"
       method of the specified class is called with the remaining arguments.

DELIMITERS
       Delimiters allow for variable substitution in the phrase. The default
       style is ':variable', which would be passed as:

           $q->delimiters( qr{ :(\w+) }x );

       As an alternative, a Template Toolkit style would be passed as:

           $q->delimiters( qr{ \[% \s* (\w+) \s* %\] }x );

DICTIONARIES
   Simple Dictionaries
       Data::Phrasebook supports the use of dictionaries. See the specific
       Loader module to see how to implement the dictionary within your
       phrasebook. Using Data::Phrasebook::Loader::Ini as an example, the
       dictionary might be laid out as:

         [Stuff]
         language=Perl
         platform=Linux

         [Nonsense]
         platform=Windows

       The phrasebook object is then created and used as:

         my $q = Data::Phrasebook->new(
           class  => 'Plain',
           loader => 'Ini',
           file   => 'phrases.ini',
           dict   => 'Nonsense',
         );

         my $language = $q->fetch('language'); # retrieves 'Perl'
         my $platform = $q->fetch('platform'); # retrieves 'Windows'

       The former is from the default (first) dictionary, and the second is
       from the named dictionary ('Nonsense'). If a phrase is not found in the
       named dictionary an attempt is made to find it in the default
       dictionary. Otherwise undef will be returned.

       Once a dictionary or file is specified, changing either requires
       reloading. As this is done at the loader stage, we need to let it know
       what it needs to reload. This can be done with the either (or both) of
       the following:

         $q->file('phrases2.ini');
         $q->dict('Stuff');

       A subsequent fetch() will then reload the file and dictionary, before
       retrieving the phrase required. However, a reload only takes place if
       both the file and the dictionary passed are not the ones currently
       loaded.

   Multiple Dictionaries
       As of version 0.25, the ability to provide prescendence over multiple
       dictionaries for the same phrasebook. Using
       Data::Phrasebook::Loader::Ini again as an example, the phrasebook might
       be laid out as:

         [AndTheOther]
         language=Perl
         platform=Linux
         network=LAN

         [That]
         platform=Solaris
         network=WLAN

         [This]
         platform=Windows

       The phrasebook object is then created and used as:

         my $q = Data::Phrasebook->new(
           class  => 'Plain',
           loader => 'Ini',
           file   => 'phrases.ini',
           dict   => ['This','That','AndTheOther'],
         );

         my $language = $q->fetch('language'); # retrieves 'Perl'
         my $platform = $q->fetch('platform'); # retrieves 'Windows'
         my $network  = $q->fetch('nework');   # retrieves 'WLAN'

       The first dictionary, if not specified and supported by the Loader
       module, is still used as the default dictionary.

       The dictionaries can be specified, or reordered, using the object
       method:

         $q->dict('That','AndTheOther','This');

       A subsequent reload will occur with the next fetch call.

DEDICATION
       Much of the code for the original class framework is from Iain's
       original code.  My code was much simpler and was tied to using just an
       INI data source. Merging all the ideas and code together we came up
       with this distribution.

       Unfortunately Iain died in December 2003, so he never got to see or
       play with the final working version. I can only thank him for his
       thoughts and ideas in getting this distribution into a state worthy of
       release.
