DESCRIPTION
       shotman takes a screenshot and shows it in a small floating thumbnail
       window.

       Screenshots are saved immediately. The first of the following locations
       that is defined is used (i.e.: if the environment variable is
       undefined, the next one on the list is used).

       1.  $XDG_SCREENSHOTS_DIR/
       2.  $XDG_PICTURES_DIR/screenshots/
       3.  $HOME/screenshots/
       4.  The current directory.

       shotman requires a compositor that supports wlr_screencopy and
       wlr_layer_shell.

KEYBOARD CONTROLS
       The following are applicable while the thumbnail window is focused:

       •   Esc or q: quit, keeping the saved the screenshot
       •   Del or d: discard (delete) the screenshot and exit
       •   Ctrl+C or XF86Copy: copy the screenshot into the clipboard
       •   Ctrl+X or XF86Cut: cut the screenshot file into the clipboard (not
           implemented)

       •   e: Edit image (opens it in GIMP) (not implemented)
       •   h,j,k,l: Move preview to another corner

       When quitting, if the screenshot has been copied into the clipboard,
       shotman will continue running in the background to allow pasting it.
       Shotman will exit as soon as it loses clipboard ownership.
