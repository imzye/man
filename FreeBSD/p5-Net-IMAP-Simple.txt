NAME
       Net::IMAP::Simple - Perl extension for simple IMAP account handling.

SYNOPSIS
           use strict;
           use warnings;
           use Net::IMAP::Simple;
           use Email::Simple;

           # Create the object
           my $imap = Net::IMAP::Simple->new('imap.example.com') ||
              die "Unable to connect to IMAP: $Net::IMAP::Simple::errstr\n";

           # Log on
           if(!$imap->login('user','pass')){
               print STDERR "Login failed: " . $imap->errstr . "\n";
               exit(64);
           }

           # Print the subject's of all the messages in the INBOX
           my $nm = $imap->select('INBOX');

           for(my $i = 1; $i <= $nm; $i++){
               if($imap->seen($i)){
                   print "*";
               } else {
                   print " ";
               }

               my $es = Email::Simple->new(join '', @{ $imap->top($i) } );

               printf("[%03d] %s\n", $i, $es->header('Subject'));
           }

           $imap->quit;

DESCRIPTION
       This module is a simple way to access IMAP accounts.

OBJECT CREATION METHOD
           my $imap = Net::IMAP::Simple->new( $server [ :port ]);

           # OR

           my $imap = Net::IMAP::Simple->new( $server [, option_name => option_value ] );

   new
       This class method constructs a new Net::IMAP::Simple object. It takes
       one required parameter which is the server to connect to, and
       additional optional parameters.

       The server parameter may specify just the server, or both the server
       and port number. To specify an alternate port, separate it from the
       server with a colon (":"), "example.com:5143".

       On success an object is returned. On failure, nothing is returned and
       an error message is set to $Net::IMAP::Simple.

       See "PREAUTH" below for a special hostname invocation that doesn't use
       Sockets (internally).

       Options are provided as a hash to new():

       port => int
           Assign the port number (default: 143)

       timeout => int (default: 90)
           Connection timeout in seconds.

       retry => int (default: 1)
           Attempt to retry the connection attmpt (x) times before giving up

       retry_delay => int (default: 5)
           Wait (x) seconds before retrying a connection attempt

       use_v6 => BOOL
           If set to true, attempt to use IPv6 sockets rather than IPv4
           sockets.

           This option requires the IO::Socket::INET6 module

       use_ssl => BOOL
           If set to true, attempt to use IO::Socket::SSL sockets rather than
           vanilla sockets.

           Note that no attempt is made to check the certificate validity by
           default.  This is terrible personal security but matches the
           previous behavior of this module.  Please consider using
           "find_ssl_defaults" below.

           This option requires the IO::Socket::SSL module

       ssl_version => version
           This should be one or more of the following (space separated):
           SSLv3 SSLv2 TLSv1.  If you specify, for example, "SSLv3 SSLv2" then
           IO::Socket::SSL will attempt auto negotiation.  At the time of this
           writing, the default string was v3/v2 auto negotiation -- it may
           have changed by the time you read this.

           Warning: setting this will also set "use_ssl".

       find_ssl_defaults => []
           Looks in some standard places for CA certificate libraries and if
           found sets reasonable defaults along the lines of the following.

               ssl_options => [ SSL_ca_path => "/etc/ssl/certs/",
                   SSL_verify_mode => IO::Socket::SSL::SSL_VERIFY_PEER() ]

           Warning: setting this will also set "use_ssl".

       ssl_options => []
           You may provide your own IO::Socket::SSL options if you desire to
           do so.  It is completely overridden by "find_ssl_defaults" above.

       bindaddr => str
           Assign a local address to bind

       use_select_cache => BOOL
           Enable select() caching internally

       select_cache_ttl => int
           The number of seconds to allow a select cache result live before
           running "$imap->select()" again.

       debug => BOOL | \*HANDLE | warn | file:name
           Enable debugging output. If "\*HANDLE" is a valid file handle,
           debugging will be written to it.  If it is the string "warn" then
           the debugging will be written using the warn command.  If it is a
           string of the form "file:name" then the named file will be opened
           for append and the debugs written to it.  Otherwise debugging will
           be written to "STDOUT"

       readline_callback => CODE
           You may choose to pass a callback function for the purpose of pre-
           processing lines before they are handed to the rest of the
           Net::IMAP::Simple internals.  This can be handy for animating a
           spinner or modifying the IMAP behavior.

PREAUTH
       Rather than passing a port number and issuing a login, in some
       situations it may be convenient to authenticate with (for example) ssh
       and simply invoke (for example) dovecot by hand.

       If the server name starts with "cmd:", then Net::IMAP::Simple will
       issue the command rather than building sockets.  This is a typical
       setup:

           my $cmd = "ssh -C mailhost dovecot --exec-mail imap";
           my $imap = Net::IMAP::Simple->new("cmd:$cmd");
            # $imap->login(); ... don't need this

           my $number_of_messages = $imap->select("INBOX");

METHODS
       starttls
               $imap->starttls;

           If you start an IMAP session and wish to upgrade to SSL later, you
           can use this function to start TLS.  This function will try to
           "require" IO::Socket::SSL and Net::SSLeay at runtime.

       login
             my $inbox_msgs = $imap->login($user, $passwd);

           This method takes two required parameters, a username and password.
           This pair is authenticated against the server. If authentication is
           successful TRUE (1) will be returned

           Nothing is returned on failure and the errstr() error handler is
           set with the error message.

       status
               my $num_messages                     = $imap->status($folder);
               my ($unseen, $recent, $num_messages) = $imap->status($folder);

           Issue a "STATUS" command.  The "STATUS" command counts messages
           without altering the state of the named (optionally) mailbox.  It
           returns either the number of messages, or the number of unseen
           messages, recent, and the total number of messages.

           $folder is an optional argument.  status() will use the current
           mailbox or "INBOX" if the $folder argument is not provided.

           This method does not use caching.

           This method can also query custom status values.  The first
           argument to the function (if any) is assumed to be the folder name,
           so the folder argument is required when trying to query custom
           status values.

               my ($f1, $f2) = $imap->status($folder, qw(f1 f2));
               my $f2        = $imap->status($folder, qw(f1 f2));

       uidnext
               my $uidnext = $imap->uidnext($folder);

           Return the "UIDNEXT" value for a mailbox.  The $folder argument is
           optional.  This is really just an alias for

               my $uidnext = $imap->status($folder, qw(uidnext));

           with the mild difference that it can compute the folder argument
           for you

       uidvalidity
               my $uidvalidity = $imap->uidnext($folder);

           Return the "UIDVALIDITY" value for a mailbox.  The $folder argument
           is optional.  This is also an alias for the status call like
           uidnext() above.

       uid This function is actually an alias for
           "$imap->uidsearch($msg_range)".

               my($uid)= $imap->uid($msgno);
               my @uid = $imap->uid($msg_range); # eg 4:14  or 15,4,14

           Return the "UID" value(s) for a message.  These unique IDs "must"
           stay the same during the session and "should" stay the same between
           sessions.  Whether they stay the same depends on the "UIDVALIDITY"
           value; see: above and RFC3501.

           Warning, although you might thing @uid should contain the "UID"s
           for 15, then 4, then 14 in the example above; most IMAP servers
           seem to return the UIDs in increasing order.  Normally the sequence
           numbers are in increasing order also, so it all maches up.

               my ($uid4, $uid14, $uid15) = $imap->uid("15,4,14"); # warning

           One final note, this gives the size of the search match, not the
           uid like you might expect:

               my $uid_search_result_list_size = $imap->uid('3'); # probably always 1

       seq
               my $seq = $imap->seq($uids);
               my @seq = $imap->seq($uids); # eg 58888:58900

           Rather like uid() above, but maps uids to sequence numbers.

       select
               my $num_messages = $imap->select($folder);

           Selects a folder named in the single required parameter. The number
           of messages in that folder is returned on success. On failure,
           nothing is returned  and the errstr() error handler is set with the
           error message.

       examine
           This is very nearly a synonym for select().  The only real
           difference is that the EXAMINE command is sent to the server
           instead of SELECT.  Net::IMAP::Simple is otherwise unaware of the
           read-only-ness of the mailbox.

       close
               $imap->close;

           Un-selects the current mailbox, leaving no mailbox selected.

       messages
               print "Messages in Junk Mail -- " . $imap->messages("INBOX.Junk Mail") .  "\n";

           This method is an alias for "$imap->select"

       flags
               print "Available server flags: " . join(", ", $imap->flags) . "\n";

           This method accepts an optional folder name and returns the current
           available server flags as a list, for the selected folder. If no
           folder name is provided the last folder "$imap->select"'ed will be
           used.

           This method uses caching.

       separator
           Returns the folder separator (technically "hierarchy separator",
           rfc3501§6.3.8) for the server.

       recent
               print "Recent messages value: " . $imap->recent . "\n";

           This method accepts an optional folder name and returns the
           'RECENT' value provided durning a SELECT result set. If no folder
           name is provided the last folder "$imap->select"'ed will be used.

           This method uses caching.

           See also: search

       unseen
               print "Unseen messages value: " . $imap->unseen . "\n";

           This method accepts an optional folder name and returns the
           'UNSEEN' value provided during a SELECT command result. If no
           folder name is provided the last folder "$imap->select"'ed will be
           used.  If a folder name is provided, this will issue a SELECT
           first.

           This method uses caching.

           If the server does not provide UNSEEN during SELECT -- surprisingly
           common -- this method will fall back and use STATUS to determine
           the unseen count.

           NOTE: This is not the opposite of seen below.  The UNSEEN value
           varies from server to server, but according to the IMAP
           specification, it should be the number of the first unseen message,
           in the case the flag is provided.  (If the flag is not provided,
           users would have to use the SEARCH command to find it.)

           See also: search

       current_box
              print "Current Mail Box folder: " . $imap->current_box . "\n";

           This method returns the current working mail box folder name.

       top
               my $header = $imap->top( $message_number ); print for @{$header};

           This method accepts a message number as its required parameter.
           That message will be retrieved from the currently selected folder.
           On success this method returns a list reference containing the
           lines of the header. Nothing is returned on failure and the
           errstr() error handler is set with the error message.

       seen
               defined( my $seen = $imap->seen( $message_number ) )
                   or warn "problem testing for \Seen: "
                         . $imap->errstr;

               print "msg #$message_number has been \Seen!" if $seen;

           A message number is the only required parameter for this method.
           The message's "\Seen" flag will be examined and if the message has
           been seen a true value is returned.  A defined false value is
           returned if the message does not have the "\Seen" flag set.  The
           undefined value is returned when an error has occurred while
           checking the flag status.

           NOTE: This is not the opposite of unseen above.  This issues a
           "FETCH" command and checks to see if the given message has been
           "\Seen" before.

       deleted
               defined( my $deleted = $imap->deleted( $message_number ) )
                   or warn "problem testing for \Deleted: "
                         . $imap->errstr;

               print "msg #$message_number has been \Deleted!" if $deleted;

           A message number is the only required parameter for this method.
           The message's "\Deleted" flag will be examined and if the message
           has been deleted a true value is returned.  A defined false value
           is returned if the message does not have the "\Deleted" flag set.
           The undefined value is returned when an error has occurred while
           checking the flag status.

       list
               my $message_size  = $imap->list($message_number);
               my $mailbox_sizes = $imap->list;

           This method returns size information for a message, as indicated in
           the single optional parameter, or all messages in a mailbox. When
           querying a single message a scalar value is returned. When listing
           the entire mailbox a hash is returned.  On failure, nothing is
           returned and the errstr() error handler is set with the error
           message.

       fetch
             my $headers = $imap->fetch("1:5")

           Fetch the headers for messages 1-5 in the current folder.

             for my $midx ( keys %$headers ) {
                 for my $hdr in ($headers->{$midx}) {
                     say "$hdr"

                     # In many situations the headers will be parsed and may not be simple
                     # strings (e.g., with the SimpleX RecDescent parse). The simplest
                     # way to get a feel for the output is to use a dumper on it.
                 }
             }

       get
             my $message = $imap->get( $message_number ) or die $imap->errstr;
             my @message_lines = $map->get( $message_number ) or die $imap->errstr;

             my $part = $imap->get( $message_number, '1.1' ) or die $imap->errstr;
             my @part_lines = $imap->get( $message_number, '1.1' ) or die $imap->errstr;

           This method fetches a message and returns its lines as an array or,
           the actual message.  On failure, either an empty list is returned
           and the errstr() error handler is set with the error message.

           Optionally, a part can be specified in order to fetch a specific
           portion of a message.  This is the raw, encoded body of the message
           part.  The part number is a set of zero or more part specifiers
           delimited by periods.  Every message has at least one part.
           Specifying a part of '1' returns the raw, encoded body.  This is
           only useful if you know the header information such as encoding.

           Historically, get() returned the array of lines as a reference to
           the array instead of returning the message or the array itself.
           Please note that it still does this, although it may be deprecated
           in the future.

           The scalar result returned is actually a blessed arrayref with the
           stringify member overloaded.  If you're intending to use the
           resulting message as a string more than once, it may make sense to
           force the stringification first.

               my $message = $imap->get(1);
                  $message = "$message"; # force stringification

           It is not normally necessary to do this.

       put
             $imap->put( $mailbox_name, $message, @flags ) or warn $imap->errstr;

           Save a message to the server under the folder named $mailbox_name.
           You may optionally specify flags for the mail (e.g. "\Seen",
           "\Answered"), but they must start with a slash.

           If $message is an arrayref, the lines will be printed correctly.

       put_with_date
             $imap->put_with_date( $mailbox_name, $message, $date, @flags ) or warn $imap->errstr;

           Save a message to the server under the folder named $mailbox_name
           just like the put method above, but supplying a date will set the
           IMAP server internal date for the message if supported per RFC 3501
           Section 6.3.11.

           Note when using this with Gmail it expects the date format to be:
           DD-Mon-YYYY hh:mm:ss tz  for example  31-Dec-2016 12:59:59 -0500

       msg_flags
               my @flags = $imap->msg_flags( $message_number );
               my $flags = $imap->msg_flags( $message_number );

               # aught to come out roughly the same
               print "Flags on message #$message_number: @flags\n";
               print "Flags on message #$message_number: $flags\n";

           Detecting errors with this member functions is usually desirable.
           In the scalar context, detecting an error is synonymous with
           testing for defined.

               if( defined( my $flags = $imap->msg_flags($num) ) ) {
                   # it has $flags!

               } else {
                   warn "problem listing flags for message #$num: "
                      . $imap->errstr;
               }

           In list context, you must call waserr() to test for success.

               my @flags = $imap->msg_flags($num);
               warn "problem listing flags for msg #$num: "
                  . $imap->errstr if $imap->waserr;

       getfh
             my $file = $imap->getfh( $message_number ); print <$file>;

           On success this method returns a file handle pointing to the
           message identified by the required parameter. On failure, nothing
           is returned and the errstr() error handler is set with the error
           message.

       quit
             $imap->quit;

             OR

             $imap->quit(BOOL);

           This method logs out of the IMAP server, expunges the selected
           mailbox, and closes the connection. No error message will ever be
           returned from this method.

           Optionally if BOOL is TRUE (1) then a hard quit is performed which
           closes the socket connection. This hard quit will still issue both
           EXPUNGE and LOGOUT commands however the response is ignored and the
           socket is closed after issuing the commands.

       logout
             $imap->logout;

           This method is just like the quit method except that it does not
           have a hard quit option and it does not expunge the mailbox before
           it hangs up and closes the socket.

       last
             my $message_number = $imap->last;

           This method returns the message number of the last message in the
           selected mailbox, since the last time the mailbox was selected. On
           failure, nothing is returned and the errstr() error handler is set
           with the error message.

       delete
             print "Gone!" if $imap->delete( $message_number );

           This method sets the "\Deleted" flag on the given message (or
           messages). On success it returns true, false on failure and the
           errstr() error handler is set with the error message.  If the flag
           was already there, no error is produced.  I takes either a message
           number or "sequence set" as the only argument.  Note that messages
           aren't actually deleted until they are expunged (see
           expunge_mailbox).

       undelete
             print "Resurrected!" if $imap->undelete( $message_number );

           This method removes the "\Deleted" flag on the given message. On
           success it returns true, false on failure and the errstr() error
           handler is set with the error message.  If the flag wasn't there,
           no error is produced.

       see
             print "You've seen message #$msgno" if $imap->see( $messageno );

           This method sets the "\Seen" flag on the given message. On success
           it returns true, false on failure and the errstr() error handler is
           set with the error message.  If the flag was already there, no
           error is produced.

       unsee
             print "You've not seen message #$msgno" if $imap->unsee( $messageno );

           This method removes the "\Seen" flag on the given message. On
           success it returns true, false on failure and the errstr() error
           handler is set with the error message.  If the flag wasn't there,
           no error is produced.

       add_flags
           delete and see above really just call this function for those
           flags.

              $imap->add_flags( $msgno, qw(\Seen \Deleted) )
                   or die $imap->errstr;

       sub_flags
           unsee above really just calls this function for that flag.

              $imap->sub_flags( $msgno, '\Seen' ) or die $imap->errstr;

       mailboxes
             my @boxes   = $imap->mailboxes;
             my @folders = $imap->mailboxes("Mail/%");
             my @lists   = $imap->mailboxes("lists/perl/*", "/Mail/");

           This method returns a list of mailboxes. When called with no
           arguments it recurses from the IMAP root to get all mailboxes. The
           first optional argument is a mailbox path and the second is the
           path reference. RFC 3501 section 6.3.8 has more information.

           On failure nothing is returned and the errstr() error handler is
           set with the error message.

       mailboxes_subscribed
             my @boxes   = $imap->mailboxes_subscribed;
             my @folders = $imap->mailboxes_subscribed("Mail/%");
             my @lists   = $imap->mailboxes_subscribed("lists/perl/*", "/Mail/");

           This method returns a list of mailboxes subscribed to. When called
           with no arguments it recurses from the IMAP root to get all
           mailboxes. The first optional argument is a mailbox path and the
           second is the path reference. RFC 3501 has more information.

           On failure nothing is returned and the errstr() error handler is
           set with the error message.

       create_mailbox
             print "Created" if $imap->create_mailbox( "/Mail/lists/perl/advocacy" );

           This method creates the mailbox named in the required argument.
           Returns true on success, false on failure and the errstr() error
           handler is set with the error message.

       expunge_mailbox
             my @expunged = $imap->expunge_mailbox( "/Mail/lists/perl/advocacy" );
             die $imap->errstr if $imap->waserr;

             my $expunged = $imap->expunge_mailbox( "/Mail/lists/perl/advocacy" )
                 or die $imap->errstr;

           This method removes all mail marked as deleted in the mailbox named
           in the required argument. Returns either the number of messages
           that were expunged, or the indexes of those messages -- which has a
           questionable usefulness since it tends to return numbers that don't
           relate to the message numbers marked with the "\Deleted" flags.

           If 0 messages were expunged without error, the function will return
           0E0 so it will still test true, but also evaluate to 0.

           In list context, you must call waserr() to test for success.

       delete_mailbox
             print "Deleted" if $imap->delete_mailbox( "/Mail/lists/perl/advocacy" );

           This method deletes the mailbox named in the required argument.
           Returns true on success, false on failure and the errstr() error
           handler is set with the error message.

       rename_mailbox
             print "Renamed" if $imap->rename_mailbox( $old => $new );

           This method renames the mailbox in the first required argument to
           the mailbox named in the second required argument. Returns true on
           success, false on failure and the errstr() error handler is set
           with the error message.

       folder_subscribe
             print "Subscribed" if $imap->folder_subscribe( "/Mail/lists/perl/advocacy" );

           This method subscribes to the folder. Returns true on success,
           false on failure and the errstr() error handler is set with the
           error message.

       folder_unsubscribe
             print "Unsubscribed" if $imap->folder_unsubscribe( "/Mail/lists/perl/advocacy" );

           This method un-subscribes to the folder. Returns true on success,
           false on failure and the errstr() error handler is set with the
           error message.

       copy
             print "copied" if $imap->copy( $message_number, $mailbox );

           This method copies the message number (or "sequence set") in the
           currently selected mailbox to the folder specified in the second
           argument.  Both arguments are required.  On success this method
           returns true. Returns false on failure and the errstr() error
           handler is set with the error message.

       uidcopy
             print "copied" if $imap->uidcopy( $message_uid, $mailbox );

           This method is identical to copy() above, except that it uses UID
           numbers instead of sequence numbers.

       noop
             $imap->noop;

           Performs a null operation.  This may be needed to get updates on a
           mailbox, or ensure that the server does not close the connection as
           idle.  RFC 3501 states that servers' idle timeouts must not be less
           than 30 minutes.

       errstr
            print "Login ERROR: " . $imap->errstr . "\n" if !$imap->login($user, $pass);

           Return the last error string captured for the last operation which
           failed.

       waserr
            my @flags = $imap->msg_flags(14);
            die $imap->errstr if $imap->waserr;

           Because msg_flags() can optionally return a list, it's not really
           possible to detect failure in list context.  Therefore, you must
           call waserr() if you wish to detect errors.

           Few of the Net::IMAP::Simple methods use waserr().  The ones that
           do will mention it.

       list2range
           Sometimes you have a long list of sequence numbers which are
           consecutive and really want to be an IMAP-style range.

               my @list  = (5..9, 13..38, 55,56,57);
               my $short = $imap->list2range(@list);

               # $short how says: 5:9,13:38,55:57

       range2list
           Pretty much the opposite of "list2range".

               my @list = $imap->range2list("1,3,5:9");
               # @list is (1,3,5,6,7,8,9);

SEARCHING
       search
           This function returns an array of message numbers (in list context)
           or the number of matched messages (in scalar context).  It takes a
           single argument: the search.

           IMAP searching can be a little confusing and this function makes no
           attempt to parse your searches.  If you wish to do searches by
           hand, please see RFC 3501.

           IMAP sorting (see RFC 5256) is supported via an optional second
           argument.  The RFC requires the charset be specified, which can be
           provided via the optional third argument (defaults to UTF-8).

           Here are a few examples:

               my @ids = $imap->search("UNSEEN");
               my @ids = $imap->search('SUBJECT "blarg is \"blarg\""');
               my @ids = $imap->search('FROM "joe@aol.com"');
               my @ids = $imap->search("DELETED");

               # example from RFC 3501, search terms are ANDed together
               my @ids = $imap->search('FLAGGED SINCE 1-Feb-1994 NOT FROM "Smith"');
               # example from RFC 3501, search terms are ORed together
               my @ids = $imap->search('OR BODY "blard" SUBJECT "blarg"');

               # flagged and ( since x or !from y ):
               my @ids = $imap->search('FLAGGED OR SINCE x NOT FROM "y"');
                 # no typo above, see the RFC

               # example from RFC 5256, sorted by subject and reverse date
               my @ids = $imap->search('BODY "zaphod"', 'SUBJECT REVERSE DATE');

           Since this module is meant to be simple, Net::IMAP::Simple has a
           few search helpers.  If you need fancy booleans and things, you'll
           have to learn search.  If you need a quick search for unseen
           messages, see below.

           These all return an array of messages or count of messages exactly
           as the search function does.  Some of them take arguments, some do
           not.  They do try to grok your arguments slightly, the mechanics of
           this (if any) will be mentioned below.

           search_seen
               Returns numbers of messages that have the \Seen flag.

           search_recent
               Returns numbers of messages that have the \Recent flag.

           search_answered
               Returns numbers of messages that have the \Answered flag.

           search_deleted
               Returns numbers of messages that have the \Deleted flag.

           search_flagged
               Returns numbers of messages that have the \Flagged flag.

           search_draft
               Returns numbers of messages that have the \Draft flag.

           search_unseen
               Returns numbers of messages that do not have the \Seen flag.

           search_old
               Returns numbers of messages that do not have the \Recent flag.

           search_unanswered
               Returns numbers of messages that do not have the \Answered
               flag.

           search_undeleted
               Returns numbers of messages that do not have the \Deleted flag.

           search_unflagged
               Returns numbers of messages that do not have the \Flagged flag.

           search_smaller
               This function takes a single argument we'll call "<x>" and
               returns numbers of messages that are smaller than "<x>" octets.
               This function will try to force your argument to be a number
               before passing it to the IMAP server.

           search_larger
               This function takes a single argument we'll call "<x>" and
               returns numbers of messages that are larger than "<x>" octets.
               This function will try to force your argument to be a number
               before passing it to the IMAP server.

           search_from
               This function takes a single argument we'll call "<x>" and
               returns numbers of messages that have "<x>" in the from header.
               This function will attempt to force your string into the
               RFC3501 quoted-string format.

           search_to
               This function takes a single argument we'll call "<x>" and
               returns numbers of messages that have "<x>" in the to header.
               This function will attempt to force your string into the
               RFC3501 quoted-string format.

           search_cc
               This function takes a single argument we'll call "<x>" and
               returns numbers of messages that have "<x>" in the cc header.
               This function will attempt to force your string into the
               RFC3501 quoted-string format.

           search_bcc
               This function takes a single argument we'll call "<x>" and
               returns numbers of messages that have "<x>" in the bcc header.
               This function will attempt to force your string into the
               RFC3501 quoted-string format.

           search_subject
               This function takes a single argument we'll call "<x>" and
               returns numbers of messages that have "<x>" in the subject
               header.  This function will attempt to force your string into
               the RFC3501 quoted-string format.

           search_body
               This function takes a single argument we'll call "<x>" and
               returns numbers of messages that have "<x>" in the message
               body.  This function will attempt to force your string into the
               RFC3501 quoted-string format.

           search_before
               This function takes a single argument we'll call "<x>" and
               returns numbers of messages that were received before "<x>".
               If you have Date::Manip installed (optional), this function
               will attempt to force the date into the format "%d-%b-%Y"
               (date-monthName-year) as RFC3501 requires.  If you do not have
               that module, no attempt will be made to coerce your date into
               the correct format.

           search_since
               This function takes a single argument we'll call "<x>" and
               returns numbers of messages that were received after "<x>".  If
               you have Date::Manip installed (optional), this function will
               attempt to force the date into the format "%d-%m-%Y" (date-
               month-year) as RFC3501 requires.  If you do not have that
               module, no attempt will be made to coerce your date into the
               correct format.

           search_sent_before
               This function takes a single argument we'll call "<x>" and
               returns numbers of messages that have a header date before
               "<x>".  If you have Date::Manip installed (optional), this
               function will attempt to force the date into the format
               "%d-%m-%Y" (date-month-year) as RFC3501 requires.  If you do
               not have that module, no attempt will be made to coerce your
               date into the correct format.

           search_sent_since
               This function takes a single argument we'll call "<x>" and
               returns numbers of messages that have a header date after
               "<x>".  If you have Date::Manip installed (optional), this
               function will attempt to force the date into the format
               "%d-%m-%Y" (date-month-year) as RFC3501 requires.  If you do
               not have that module, no attempt will be made to coerce your
               date into the correct format.

       uidsearch
           This function works exactly like search() but it returns UIDs
           instead of sequence numbers.  The convenient shortcuts above are
           not provided for it.

OTHER NOTES
       sequence set
           Message numbers are never checked before being passed to the IMAP
           server (this is a "simple" module after all), so in most places
           where a message number is required, you can instead use so-called
           sequence sets.  Examples:

               $imap->copy(   "3,4,9:22", "ANOTHERBOX" ) or die $imap->errstr;
               $imap->delete( "3,4,9:22" ) or die $imap->errstr;
