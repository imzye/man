ZFS-SHARE(8)            FreeBSD System Manager's Manual           ZFS-SHARE(8)

NAME
     zfs-share – share and unshare ZFS filesystems

SYNOPSIS
     zfs share [-l] -a|filesystem
     zfs unshare -a|filesystem|mountpoint

DESCRIPTION
     zfs share [-l] -a|filesystem
       Shares available ZFS file systems.

       -l  Load keys for encrypted filesystems as they are being mounted.
           This is equivalent to executing zfs load-key on each encryption
           root before mounting it.  Note that if a filesystem has
           keylocation=prompt, this will cause the terminal to interactively
           block after asking for the key.

       -a  Share all available ZFS file systems.  Invoked automatically as
           part of the boot process.

       filesystem
           Share the specified filesystem according to the sharenfs and
           sharesmb properties.  File systems are shared when the sharenfs or
           sharesmb property is set.

     zfs unshare -a|filesystem|mountpoint
       Unshares currently shared ZFS file systems.

       -a  Unshare all available ZFS file systems.  Invoked automatically as
           part of the shutdown process.

       filesystem|mountpoint
           Unshare the specified filesystem.  The command can also be given a
           path to a ZFS file system shared on the system.
