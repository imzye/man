NAME
       lunar (version 2.1) - a calendar conversion utility

SYNTAX
       lunar [ -h ] [ -5 ] [ -b ] [ -i ] [ -l ] year month day [ hour ]

DESCRIPTION
       The program performs date conversion between the Gregorian Solar
       Calendar (SC) and the Chinese Lunar Calendar (LC).  Given a date in
       either calendar, the program also outputs the corresponding "shengxiao"
       (animal of the year) and "ganzhi" characters.  The date range currently
       covered is from about 1900 A.D. to 2049 A.D.

       For the sake of convenience, we choose the convention such that the
       solar and lunar year numbers of the first day of a lunar year are the
       same.  For example, SC 1991.2.15 is LC 1991.1.1, while SC 1991.2.14 is
       LC 1990.12.30.  Moreover, we choose the convention such that the solar
       and lunar hour numbers (in 24-hour clock) of a date are the same,
       although a lunar day starts at 23:00 of a solar day. This means that SC
       1991.2.15.23 is LC 1991.1.2.23, while SC 1991.2.16.0 is LC 1991.1.2.0,
       and SC 1991.2.16.1 is LC 1991.1.2.1.

       The standard time of the Lunar Calendar is Beijing (Hong Kong) Standard
       Time, not GMT.  Be sure to adjust appropriately for other time zones
       and "Day-light Saving Time".

       In the Lunar Calendar, a normal year has 12 months, and a leap year
       (run-nian) has 13 months, where the extra month is called a "leap
       month" (run-yue).  For example, the leap month that follows immediately
       the 6-th lunar month is called the 6-th leap month.  A (leap) month is
       either a short or long one, which has 29 or 30 days respectively.

       There are 10 gan's and 12 zhi's.  The ganzhi labeling of the year,
       month, day and hour of a date is a member of the Cartesian product
       GxGxGxG, where G = {1,2,...,60}.  For example, "jia-zi" is 1, "yi-chou"
       is 2, and so on.  The ganzhi of the j-th leap month is the same as that
       of the j-th month.

       The possible options are

       -b     output ganzhi in special "bitmap" characters.

       -h     output hanzi or Simplified Chinese characters encoded in
              (highest-bit-set) GB code.

       -5     output Traditional Chinese characters encoded in (highest-bit-
              set) BIG5 code.

       -i     convert a lunar date to solar date.  The default is to convert a
              solar date to a lunar date.

       -l     indicate the month is a lunar leap month.  This option is
              meaningful only when the "-i" option is used.
