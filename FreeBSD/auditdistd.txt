NAME
     auditdistd – Audit trail files distribution daemon

SYNOPSIS
     auditdistd [-dFhl] [-c config] [-P pidfile]

DESCRIPTION
     The auditdistd daemon is responsible for distributing audit trail files
     over a TCP/IP network in a secure and reliable way.

     The auditdistd daemon can be started with the following command line
     arguments:

     -c config         Specify an alternative location of the configuration
                       file.  The default location is
                       /etc/security/auditdistd.conf.  Note: the configuration
                       file may contain passwords.  Care should be taken to
                       configure proper permissions on this file (eg. 0600).

     -d                Print or log debugging information.  This option can be
                       specified multiple times to raise the verbosity level.

     -F                Start the auditdistd daemon in the foreground.  By
                       default auditdistd starts in the background.

     -h                Print the auditdistd usage message.

     -l                Start in a launchd-friendly mode, ie. do not use
                       daemon(3).

     -P pidfile        Specify an alternative location of a file where main
                       process PID will be stored.  The default location is
                       /var/run/auditdistd.pid.

FILES
     /etc/security/auditdistd.conf      The configuration file for auditdistd.
     /var/run/auditdistd.pid            The default location of the auditdistd
                                        PID file.

EXIT STATUS
     Exit status is 0 on success, or one of the values described in
     sysexits(3) on failure.
