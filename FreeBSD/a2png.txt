NAME
       a2png - convert ASCII text to PNG bitmap image

SYNOPSIS
       a2png [ options ] [ file(s) ]

DESCRIPTION
       a2png reads text from files or standard input and renders them to a PNG
       bitmap image.  The first version is pretty simple, and will only handle
       newlines, carriage returns and tabs -- ANSI schemes is not supported.

       The Cairo graphics library is used for rendering the file in memory.

OPTIONS
       -      Read text from standard input

       --background=...
              Set background color.  The format is the same as for HTML/CSS,
              i.e. aabbcc, in RGB values.  Default is black (000000).

       --bold Use bold font.

       --charspacing=...
              Set horizontal spacing between characters in pixels.  Default is
              0.  You can also use negative.

       --fixed
              Make any font fixed-width by using the horizontal spacing of the
              widest character in the Latin1 character set.

       --font=...
              Set font family to use.  You can either point directly to a font
              file, as in --font=myfont.ttf, or simply the name "myfont" if
              that font exists as myfont.ttf or myfont.ttc in the default font
              search path.

              If you want to use a font in your current directory, you must
              specify it like this: --font=./fontname.ttf

              You can also set your own font search path with a comma
              delimited list in the environment variable GDFONTPATH, if you
              are using gdlib for rendering.

              If you have ghostscript installed, you can do a `which gs' and
              investigate that path's share/ghostscript/fonts/, e.g.
              /usr/local/share/ghostscript/fonts/.  If you find any
              ghostscript fonts, you can try using one of them.  Check out the
              file `Fontmap' in that directory for descriptive names for those
              fonts.

              Both Cairo and GD use Freetype as a font subsystem, so you can
              try some fonts with that distribution.  The --font parameter can
              hence read any fonts that Freetype can handle, so you can try
              with almost any font formats (including truetype fonts).

              If you are using Cairo, then a lot of fonts like "Fixed" are
              shipped with the installation.  In that case, you cannot use
              GDFONTPATH.

              In most cases you will want to use a monospaced font, such as
              `Courier' or `Courier New'.  If you don't have any monospaced
              font, you can emulate the behaviour by using the option --fixed.

       --font-size=...
              Set font size.  Note that you cannot use pixels or pt here.  The
              size is a floating point value, defaulting to 0.025.

       --foreground=...
              Set foreground color.  The format is the same as for HTML/CSS,
              i.e. aabbcc, in RGB values.  Default is white (ffffff).

       --format=...
              Set PNG pixel format.  Available values are ARGB32 (default),
              RGB24 and A8 (alpha values, 8 bits per pixel).

       --height=...
              Set output height in pixels.  Default is 480.

       --html-input
              Unfortunately this is probably not what you are looking for.
              This program will *not* render HTML pages.  Instead, it reads
              the exact format that is output from the program jp2a using the
              options `--colors --html-raw' (see http://jp2a.sourceforge.net
              for more information on jp2a).

              This is used to color the characters.  For reference, the format
              is this:

              <span style='color:#rrggbb;'>A</span><br/>

              The <br/> is used to break lines.  No newlines are accepted, and
              the code to parse this input is extremely bad, so you shouldn't
              get your hopes up for this one.

       --help -h
              Print help.

       --linespacing=...
              Sets amount of extra pixels to add between each line.  The
              default is to add 2 pixels.  You can set this to zero, or even
              negative values.

       --no-crop
              Do not crop away the unused image areas after rendering the
              text.

       --output=...
              Set output filename or a directory to write the files to.

       --overwrite
              Overwrite existing files.  The default is not to overwrite,
              instead adding a numbered suffix to the filename.  That is, if
              you convert foo.txt you get foo.png the first time you convert.
              The second time you'll get foo2.png and so on.

       --verbose
              Print verbose output messages.  This is useful when you want to
              know the cropping dimensions, and when converting multiple files
              to see their output names.

       --width=...
              Set output width in pixels.  Default is 640.

       --version -V
              Print program version and exit.

       --silent -s
              Silent mode; do not print any messages to the console.

       --size=WxH
              Set output width and height in pixels.  Default is 640x480.

       --tab=...
              Set the number of spaces that tab characters will expand to.
              Default is 8.

EXAMPLES
       Convert files to 800x600 pixels:     a2png --size=800x600 file1 file2

       Convert text from standard input:    a2png --size=800x600 -

       Convert file with yellow background: a2png --background=ffff00
       somefile.txt

RETURN VALUES
       a2png returns 0 for success and 1 for errors.

BUGS
       Carriage returns do not work correctly; they do not replace the
       characters they overwrite, so you get garbled output.

       The --transparent option does not work with gdlib.

       The --bold option does not work with gdlib.

       Only Latin1 characters are accepted, although the subsystems do support
       UTF-8.

       Check the web at http://a2png.sourceforge.net for new versions, these
       issues might very well be fixed in future updates.
