NAME
       XML::TreeBuilder - Parser that builds a tree of XML::Element objects

SYNOPSIS
         foreach my $file_name (@ARGV) {
           my $tree = XML::TreeBuilder->new({ 'NoExpand' => 0, 'ErrorContext' => 0 }); # empty tree
           $tree->parse_file($file_name);
           print "Hey, here's a dump of the parse tree of $file_name:\n";
           $tree->dump; # a method we inherit from XML::Element
           print "And here it is, bizarrely rerendered as XML:\n",
             $tree->as_XML, "\n";

           # Now that we're done with it, we must destroy it.
           $tree = $tree->delete;
         }

DESCRIPTION
       This module uses XML::Parser to make XML document trees constructed of
       XML::Element objects (and XML::Element is a subclass of HTML::Element
       adapted for XML).  XML::TreeBuilder is meant particularly for people
       who are used to the HTML::TreeBuilder / HTML::Element interface to
       document trees, and who don't want to learn some other document
       interface like XML::Twig or XML::DOM.

       The way to use this class is to:

       1. start a new (empty) XML::TreeBuilder object.

       2. set any of the "store" options you want.

       3. then parse the document from a source by calling
       "$x->parsefile(...)" or "$x->parse(...)" (See XML::Parser docs for the
       options that these two methods take)

       4. do whatever you need to do with the syntax tree, presumably
       involving traversing it looking for some bit of information in it,

       5. and finally, when you're done with the tree, call $tree->delete to
       erase the contents of the tree from memory.  This kind of thing usually
       isn't necessary with most Perl objects, but it's necessary for
       TreeBuilder objects.  See HTML::Element for a more verbose explanation
       of why this is the case.

METHODS AND ATTRIBUTES
       XML::TreeBuilder is a subclass of XML::Element, which in turn is a
       subclass of HTML:Element.  You should read and understand the
       documentation for those two modules.

       An XML::TreeBuilder object is just a special XML::Element object that
       allows you to call these additional methods:

       $root = XML::TreeBuilder->new()
           Construct a new XML::TreeBuilder object.

           Parameters:

           NoExpand
                   Passed to XML::Parser. Do not Expand external entities.
                   Default: undef

           ErrorContext
                   Passed to XML::Parser. Number of context lines to generate on errors.
                   Default: undef

           catalog
                   Path to an Oasis XML catalog. Passed to XML::Catalog to resolve entities if NoExpand is not set.
                   Default: $ENV{XML_CATALOG_FILES} || '/etc/xml/catalog'

       $root->eof
           Deletes parser object.

       $root->parse(...options...)
           Uses XML::Parser's "parse" method to parse XML from the source(s?)
           specified by the options.  See XML::Parse

       $root->parsefile(...options...)
           Uses XML::Parser's "parsefile" method to parse XML from the
           source(s?)  specified by the options.  See XML::Parse

       $root->parse_file(...options...)
           Simply an alias for "parsefile".

       $root->store_comments(value)
           This determines whether TreeBuilder will normally store comments
           found while parsing content into $root.  Currently, this is off by
           default.

       $root->store_declarations(value)
           This determines whether TreeBuilder will normally store markup
           declarations found while parsing content into $root.  Currently,
           this is off by default.

       $root->store_pis(value)
           This determines whether TreeBuilder will normally store processing
           instructions found while parsing content into $root.  Currently,
           this is off (false) by default.

       $root->store_cdata(value)
           This determines whether TreeBuilder will normally store CDATA
           sectitons found while parsing content into $root. Adds a ~cdata
           node.

           Currently, this is off (false) by default.
