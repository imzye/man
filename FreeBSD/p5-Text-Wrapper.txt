NAME
       Text::Wrapper - Word wrap text by breaking long lines

VERSION
       This document describes version 1.05 of Text::Wrapper, released January
       18, 2014.

SYNOPSIS
           require Text::Wrapper;
           $wrapper = Text::Wrapper->new(columns => 60, body_start => '    ');
           print $wrapper->wrap($text);
           $wrapper->columns(70);

DESCRIPTION
       Text::Wrapper provides simple word wrapping.  It breaks long lines, but
       does not alter spacing or remove existing line breaks.  If you're
       looking for more sophisticated text formatting, try the Text::Format
       module.

       Reasons to use Text::Wrapper instead of Text::Format:

       •   Text::Wrapper is significantly smaller.

       •   It does not alter existing whitespace or combine short lines.  It
           only breaks long lines.

       Again, if Text::Wrapper doesn't meet your needs, try Text::Format.

ATTRIBUTES
   body_start
       The text that begins the second and following lines of a paragraph.
       (Default '')

   columns
       The number of columns to use.  This includes any text in body_start or
       par_start.  (Default 70)

   par_start
       The text that begins the first line of each paragraph.  (Default '')

   wrap_after
       A line can wrap after any of the characters in this string.  Setting
       this to the empty string means a line will wrap only at whitespace.
       (Default '-')

METHODS
   wrap
         $wrapper->wrap($text)

       Returns a word wrapped copy of $text.  The original is not altered.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
       Text::Wrapper requires no configuration files or environment variables.

DEPENDENCIES
       None.

INCOMPATIBILITIES
       None reported.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       Does not handle tabs (they're treated just like spaces).

       All characters are treated as being the same width, including zero-
       width spaces and combining accents.

       Does not break words that can't fit on one line.
