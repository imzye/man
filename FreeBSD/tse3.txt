DESCRIPTION
       tse3play plays TSE3MDL files and MIDI files using the TSE3 sequencer
       engine. It was originally developed as a test application for the TSE3
       engine, but is now a fully featured playback application.

       tse3play can also convert files between the two supported formats.
       Whilst playing it provides text based visual feedback, or can stream an
       English representation of the contents of the file to standard output.

       MIDI files are a standard file format for the storage of musical (song)
       data that can be found in abundance on the internet. They don't contain
       the actual sounds played, but instructions on how to recreate the song
       (i.e. start note/stop note commands). MIDI files are most often created
       by a sequencer application (akin to a word processor for music). MIDI
       files often have the extension .mid or .midi

       TSE3MDL ( TSE3 Music Description Langauge ) files are a similar form of
       music file. They are created by sequencer applications based on the
       TSE3 sequencer engine library. The file format contains a great deal
       more information and harnesses the full power of the TSE3 library.
       TSE3MDL files often have the extension .tse3

       The type of the input file is automatically detected by tse3play
       tse3play can also load legacy TSE2MDL files from sequencers based on
       the older TSE2 sequencer library.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Provide help on the tse3play command line parameters.

       -ver, --version
              Print version number and exit.

       -v, --verbose
              Give verbose output on what tse3play is trying to do.

       -list, --list-ports
              Lists the port numbers available on your platform.

       -nv, --novisual
              Don't produce visual feedback (text-based output-level
              indicator).

       -np, --noplay
              Don't play the input file (only perform a conversion - if one is
              specified).

       -l, --loop
              Loop playback of the input file.

       -omidi, --out-midi <filename>
              Convert the loaded file to MIDI. File type will be MIDI type 1
              unless -omidi0 is specified. The filename of the output follows
              this option. You can specify '-' to output on stdandard out.

       -omidi0, --out-midi-format-0
              If performing a MIDI conversion, produce an output file in MIDI
              type 0 format. For most cases the default (type 1) is
              recommended.

       -omidicomp, --out-midi-compact
              Compact the converted MIDI file output. This removes any
              redundant information in the MIDI file that could be removed by
              using MIDI running status.

       -otse3mdl, --out-tse3mdl FILENAME
              Convert the file to tse3mdl format. The filename of the output
              follows this option. You can specify '-' to output on stdandard
              out.

       -map, --map-channel F T
              During playback, map MIDI channel F to MIDI channel T. Channel
              numbers start at zero.

       -m, --metronome
              During playback, produce a metronome tick.

       -r, --reset
              Send a basic MIDI reset message at playback start and end. This
              will send a reset message even if -np is specified.

       -gmr, --gmreset
              Send a General MIDI reset message at playback start and end.
              This will send a reset message even if -np is specified.

       -gsr, --gsreset
              Send a GS reset message at playback start and end. This will
              send a reset message even if -np is specified.

       -xgr, --xgreset
              Send an XG reset message at playback start and end. This will
              send a reset message even if -np is specified.

       -unix, --unix-scheduler
              Selects the best Unix scheduler device (either OSS or ALSA) as
              the MIDI output method. This is the default behaviour.

       -oss, --oss-scheduler
              Selects the Open Sound System interface as the MIDI output
              method.

       -alsa, --alsa-scheduler
              Selects the ALSA interface as the MIDI output method. This will
              only work if you have ALSA installed on your computer.

       -arts, --arts-scheduler
              Selects the aRts interface as the MIDI output method. This will
              only work if you have aRts installed on your computer.

       -stream, --stream-scheduler
              Selects the standard output stream as the MIDI output method. An
              English interpretation of each MIDI command generated will
              appear on standard out.

       -s, --start
              Begin playback at the specified clock pulse. The pulses are
              divisions of quarter notes.  tse3play works to a resolution of
              96 PPQN.

       -solo, --solo-track
              Play with the specified input track 'soloed'. This will mute all
              the other tracks. Note that this option will mute the input
              track from the file, not the specified MIDI channel. Track
              numbers start at zero.

       -sl, --sleep
              Sets the time period that tse3play returns control back to the
              operating system between updates. The parameter is a number of
              u-seconds. The default value is 100. Specifying a shorter time
              will make the real time vu bars update more responsively. A
              value of 0 disables the sleep.

       -stop, --no-stop
              Prevents tse3play from exiting once playback has finished. This
              can be used in conjunction with --echo and no specified filename
              to make the computer act as a MIDI Thru box.

       -e, --echo
              Enable the MIDI echo facility, which is a soft MIDI Thru port.
              Anything received on the MIDI in connection will be immediately
              echoed on the MIDI out.

       -mute, --mute-track
              Mutes the specified track in the input file. The first track is
              track zero.

       -pd, --patches-dir
              Specifies the path to the directory in which FM or GUS patch
              files are to be found. This is used by the OSS driver to load
              sounds into the soundcard.

       -port, --force-port
              Forces all output to the specified port.

       -fast, --fast-midi
              Tells tse3play to use a faster MIDI file import routine. This
              will make the MIDI file playback start almost instantaneously
              (especially noticeable for very large MIDI files).  You can only
              use this if you are not converting a file.

              It has a number of possible side effects; (i) The MIDI file's
              last time stamp is trusted to be correct (it might not be) (ii)
              Stopping playback half way through may produce 'hanging notes'

BUGS
       Naturally, tse3play is completely bug free. The TSE3 library upon which
       it is based is also completely bug free. However, if you do find
       something goes wrong then contact the author. The program can only be
       improved with your feedback.
