NAME
       Algorithm::MinMax - Finding the minimum and maximum of an array with at
       most 3n/2 - 2 comparisons.

SYNOPSIS
         use Algorithm::MinMax;
         @a = ( 3, 2, 5, 4, 8, 9 );
         @r = Algorithm::MinMax->minmax( \@a );

         # $r[0] = minimum = 2
         # $r[1] = maximum = 9

DESCRIPTION
       The implementation finds the minimum and maximum of a given array with
       at most 3n/2 - 2 comparisons, where n is the number of elements of the
       array.

RETURN
       Returns an array where the first entry is the minimum and the second
       entry the maximum of the given array.

       If minmax is called with an empty array, minmax will also return an
       empty array.
