UI(1)                   FreeBSD General Commands Manual                  UI(1)

NAME
     ui – show information about local users

SYNOPSIS
     ui [-hvVL] [-F separator] [-m separator] [-t format] [-d]
        [[-xXO] module1.so [options] [-- [-xXO] module2.so [options] [...]]]
        [-c filename] [user] | [-f filename] [...]

DESCRIPTION
     ui uses loadable modules to display various information about a local
     user.  Multiple usernames or filenames (see -f) may be specified. If no
     arguments are given or a username or filename is ‘-’, then arguments are
     read via standard input.

     -d
       Load the default modules (passwd.so, mail.so and login.so). This can be
       used anywhere in the module list.

     -t format
       Specify an alternate time format for modules which have time values.
       See the strftime(3) manual page for format syntax.

     -c filename
       Load a configuration file. May be used more than once. See below for
       details.

     -O filename
       Load a module. The remaining switches are to be options for this
       module. End options for this module by specifying --.  This option may
       by used more than once. Due to the way module chaining is implemented,
       the same module may be loaded more than once.

     -x filename
       Like -O but chain module1.so output to module2.so input. This will only
       work if the module is chainable. You can specify this option more than
       once for unlimited chaining.

     -X filename
       The same as -x but don't output module1.so info, only pass the strings
       to module2.so for processing.

     -F separator
       Alternate character used to separate fields. Standard escape sequences
       are supported.

     -m separator
       Alternate character used to separate multi string values. Standard
       escape sequences are supported.

     -f
       Get information for the owners of the specified files.

     -L
       If the -f option is specified and the file is a symbolic link, get
       owner information for the file the link points to and not the link
       itself.

     -v
       Be verbose when possible. Some modules may limit their display. This
       should show everything available. This is reset for each loaded module
       unless specified twice.

     -h
       Display help text. A module must be specified either with the -O
       command line option or loaded via configuration file -c for a modules
       help text to be displayed.

     -V
       Version information.

RETURN VALUES
     Returns 1 on failure and 0 on success. Note that a modules return value
     affects this exit status.

FILES
     PREFIX/lib/userinfo Default location of loadable modules.

EXAMPLES
     The following will load two modules, specify module options and load a
     configuration file. Module options end when -- is reached.

     ui -O module.so -switches -- -O another.so -- -c filename `users`

SEE ALSO
     strftime(3), passwd(5), aliases(5), forward(5), utmp(5), lastlog(5),
     ld.so(8) dlopen(3)

CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX
     There is no default configuration file that will be loaded so you'll have
     to create one and load it with the -c command-line option. Empty lines
     and everything to the right of a '#' are ignored. If you need a '#' in
     your options, escape it with a '\'. This file should contain any modules
     you want loaded and their options separated by one or more whitespace
     characters on one line per module.

     Each module should have a .so filename extension. If a module filename
     begins with a ~, it will be expanded to your home directory. Some module
     options may require quoting.  Single and double quotes are supported and
     may also be escaped with a backslash character. Multiple configuration
     files may be specified and may also be used with the -O command-line
     option. The order of module loading and output is dependent on the order
     of the module stack and any module options.

     If you want module chaining, put a '>' or '-' at the beginning of the
     module name before any '~'. This is the same as specifying -x or -X on
     the command line, respectively. The following module, which may also be
     chained, will be chained to this module.
