NAME
       Algorithm::LCS - Fast (XS) implementation of the
                        Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) Algorithm

SYNOPSIS
         use Algorithm::LCS;

         $alg = Algorithm::LCS->new;
         @lcs = $alg->LCS(\@a,\@b);

         $cb = $alg->callback(@b); # closure
         @lcs = $cb->(\@a);        # same result as prior LCS() call

ABSTRACT
       Algorithm::LCS reimplements Algorithm::Diff's core loop in XS, and
       provides a simple OO interface to it.

       Extract from the Algorithm::Diff v1.15 manpage:

         The algorithm is that described in
         I<A Fast Algorithm for Computing Longest Common Subsequences>,
         CACM, vol.20, no.5, pp.350-353, May 1977, with a few
         minor improvements to improve the speed.

DESCRIPTION
   CONSTRUCTOR
       new()
           Creates a new object which maintains internal storage areas for the
           LCS computation.  Use one of these per concurrent LCS() call.

   METHODS
       line_map(@lines)
           Send @lines to a hashref containing elements of the form

                  value => [(increasing) list of matching indices]

       callback(@lines)
           Generates a closure capturing the object and line_map hash for
           @lines.  Most useful when computing multiple LCSs against a single
           file.

       LCS(\@a,\@b)
           Finds a Longest Common Subsequence, taking two arrayrefs as method
           arguments.  In scalar context the return value is the length of the
           subsequence.  In list context it yields a list of corresponding
           indices, which are represented by 2-element array refs.  See the
           Algorithm::Diff manpage for more details.

   EXPORT
       None by design.
