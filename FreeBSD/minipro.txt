NAME
       minipro - A free and open TL866XX programmer.


DESCRIPTION
       minipro is an Open Source tool intended to become a complete cross-
       platform replacement for the proprietary utility from Autoelectric.
       Currently it supports more than 13000 of target devices - including
       AVRs, PICs as well as a huge number of other microcontrollers and
       various memory chips.


GENERAL OPTIONS
       -l, --list
              List all supported devices.


       -L, --search <search>
              List devices like this.


       -q, --programmer <version>
              Force a programmer version when listing devices.
              Possible values: TL866A TL866II.


       -Q, --query_supported
              Query supported programmers.


       -k, --presence_check
              Query the programmer version currently connected.


       -d, --get_info <device>
              Show device information.


       -D, --get_id
              FIXME Just read the chip ID and do nothing else (like reading
              the whole chip contents).  This is for use in scripts where you
              have for example several similar chips with different IDs and
              want to check if the currently inserted chip is one in your list
              of allowed ones. Also useful to detect if a chip is inserted at
              all when using the -y option.


       -r, --read <filename>
              Read from the device and write the contents to this file.


       -w, --write <filename>
              Write to the device using this file.


       -m, --verify <filename>
              Verify memory in the device against this file.


       -c, --page <type>
              Specify memory type (optional).
              Possible values: code, data, config, user, calibration.
              The calibration byte(s) are Atmel AVR family specific and are
              read-only.  User memory type is implemented as user row or
              encryption table on some devices like Atmel AT89S8253.  Use -c
              user to read or write this page.


       -f, --format <format>
              Specify file format.  Possible values: ihex, srec.


       -b, --blank_check
              Blank check.
              Optionally, you can use -c to specify a memory type.


       -a <type>, --auto_detect
              Auto-detect SPI 25xx devices.
              Possible values: 8, 16.


       -z, --pin_check
              Check for bad pin contact.


       -e, --skip_erase
              Do NOT erase device.


       -E, --erase
              Just erase device.


       -o <option>
              Specify various options.  For multiple options, use -o multiple
              times.  For example: -o vpp=12 -o vcc=5.5 or long options:
              -vpp=12 --vcc=5.5
              Valid options are:

              -o vpp=<value>, --vpp <value>
                     Set the programming voltage.
                     For TL866A/CS: 10, 12.5, 13.5, 14, 15.5, 16, 17, 18, 21.
                     For TL866II+: 9, 9.5, 10, 11, 11.5, 12, 12.5, 13, 13.5,

                     6.5).
                     For setting the VCC logic test voltage (1.8, 2.5, 3.3,

NOTES FOR READING AND WRITING
       If -c is omitted and -r is specified then the code, data (if
       applicable) and config (if applicable) will be written to
       filename.$ext, filename.eeprom.bin and filename.fuses.conf
       correspondingly. If -c is omitted and -w is specified, then -c code is
       assumed.
       By  default, when in write mode and -c config is specified, no erase is
       performed to preserve the already programmed data.
       However, you can force an erase in this case with the -E option.


       --fuses, --uid, --lock flags will read/write/verify/blank check fuses,
       user id or lock config section. User ID is Microchip PIC MPU family
       specific. For example: minipro -p atmega32 -b --fuses will check if
       fuse bits are in their default state (that is, blank state)


       Use --pulse, --vpp, --vdd, --vcc or -o <option> to specify various
       programming options. These options are available only in write mode (
       -w ) and only for some devices like UV erasable EPROMs and GAL/ATF
       PLDs.
       Also you can specify --vcc or -o vcc with -T to specify the logic test
       voltage.
       Use -d <device> to view if those options are supported.



UPDATING FIRMWARE
       Firmware update files can be obtained from the manufacturer's website:
       http://www.autoelectric.cn.
       They can also be downloaded and extracted from the following
       repository: https://github.com/Kreeblah/XGecu_Software.
       For the TL866A/CS, use the "update.dat" file.
       For the TL866IOI+, use the "updateII.dat" file.

       ==== EDIT LINE ====


       When writing chips, this is not necessary because the file format is
       automatically detected.  There is no need to specify the exact Intex
       hex format (ihex8, ihex16, or ihex32) as the format is automatically
       detected.  If this option is not used, then the file will be saved as a
       raw binary file.

       When reading chips and the ihex format is chosen, if the data size is
       up to 64Kb the file will be saved in ihex8 format. Just plain hex
       records are used -- no segment/linear address records are inserted.  If
       the data size exceeds 64Kb then the ihex32 format is used. The ihex16
       format is not used when reading chips.  The same strategy is used for
       the Motorola srecord format.


       -F <filename>
              Update firmware (should be update.dat).


       -h     Show help and quit.


NOTES
       If -c is omitted and -r is specified then the code, data (if
       applicable) and config (if applicable) will be written to
       filename.$ext, filename.eeprom.bin and filename.fuses.conf
       correspondingly. If -c is omitted and -w is specified, then -c code is
       assumed.


PIPES
       Minipro supports reading and writing to standard input and output.  To
       do this, use a dash (-) as a filename for the -w or -r options.

       For example:

       head -c 256k < /dev/urandom | srec_cat - -bin -o - -intel
       -Address_Length=4 -obs=16 | minipro -p w49f002u -w-

       This is how the hex/srec parsers were tested for reading from stdin.
       256kb of random binary data is generated then converted from binary to
       intel hex by the srec_cat utility. Finally the converted data is passed
       to our minipro which will read this data, convert it to binary by
       decoding the intel hex format from stdin and write it to the specified
       chip.  Note the -r- which tells to read from stdin instead from a
       regular file.  This is just a test command to test the ihex/srec
       parsers.  Don't use this in real life (convert from binary to ihex then
       from ihex to binary).

       You can also read a chip and write the data to the stdout like this:

       minipro -p w49f002u -r- -f ihex.

       You can then pass the output to another command line tool with | for
       other processing, etc.


FUSES
       Fuses can be read and written with the -c config option. Fuse data is
       exchanged in a text format. When writing fuses all fuses on your device
       must be assigned a value. To see what fuses are supported by your
       device use -r with -c config to get your current fuse values. This also
       shows you what the text format looks like.


EXAMPLES
       minipro -p 7404 -T
           Check whether a 74(LS/HC/...)04 hex NOT gate chip.
