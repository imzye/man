SHA(3)                User Contributed Perl Documentation               SHA(3)


NAME
       SHA - Perl interface to the NIST Secure Hash Algorithm

SYNOPSIS
           use SHA;

           $version = &SHA::sha_version;

           $context = new SHA;
           $context->reset();

           $context->add(LIST);
           $context->addfile(HANDLE);

           $digest = $context->digest();
           $string = $context->hexdigest();

           $digest = $context->hash($string);
           $string = $context->hexhash($string);

DESCRIPTION
       The "SHA" module is depreciated.  Use "Digest::SHA1" instead.

       The current "SHA" module is just a wrapper around the "Digest::SHA1"
       module.  It is provided so that legacy code that rely on the old
       interface still work.  This wrapper does not support the old (and
       buggy) SHA-0 algorithm.

       In addition to the methods provided by "Digest::SHA1" this module
       provide the class methods SHA->hash() and SHA->hexhash() that basically
       do the same as the sha1() and sha1_hex() functions provided
       "Digest::SHA1".

       The SHA->hex* methods will insert spaces between groups of 8 hex
       characters, while the Digest::SHA1 version of the same methods will not
       do this.
