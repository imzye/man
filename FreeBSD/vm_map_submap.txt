VM_MAP_SUBMAP(9)       FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual      VM_MAP_SUBMAP(9)

NAME
     vm_map_submap – create a subordinate map

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <vm/vm.h>
     #include <vm/vm_map.h>

     int
     vm_map_submap(vm_map_t map, vm_offset_t start, vm_offset_t end,
         vm_map_t submap);

DESCRIPTION
     The vm_map_submap() function marks the range bounded by start and end
     within the map map as being handled by a subordinate map sub_map.

     It is generally called by the kernel memory allocator.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
     This function is for internal use only.

     Both maps must exist.  The range must have been created with
     vm_map_find(9) previously.

     No other operations may have been performed on this range before calling
     this function.  Only the vm_fault() operation may be performed within
     this range after calling this function.

     To remove a submapping, one must first remove the range from the parent
     map, and then destroy the sub_map.  This procedure is not recommended.

RETURN VALUES
     The vm_map_submap() function returns KERN_SUCCESS if successful.

     Otherwise, it returns KERN_INVALID_ARGUMENT if the caller requested copy-
     on-write flags, or if the range specified for the sub-map was out of
     range for the parent map, or if a NULL backing object was specified.
