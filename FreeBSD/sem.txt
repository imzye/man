NAME
     sem – POSIX semaphores

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following line in your
     kernel configuration file:

           options P1003_1B_SEMAPHORES

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           sem_load="YES"

     To load the driver as a module at run-time, run the following command as
     root:

           kldload sem

DESCRIPTION
     The sem facility provides system calls used by the standard C library
     (libc) to implement POSIX semaphores.  This facility offers support for
     such functions as sem_init() and sem_wait().  It is available both as a
     kernel option for static inclusion and as a dynamic kernel module.

     sem_destroy(3), sem_getvalue(3), sem_init(3), sem_open(3), sem_post(3),

HISTORY
     The sem facility appeared in FreeBSD 5.0.
