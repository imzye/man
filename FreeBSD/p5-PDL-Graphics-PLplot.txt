NAME
       PDL::Graphics::PLplot - Object-oriented interface from perl/PDL to the
       PLPLOT plotting library

SYNOPSIS
         use PDL;
         use PDL::Graphics::PLplot;

         my $pl = PDL::Graphics::PLplot->new (DEV => "png", FILE => "test.png");
         my $x  = sequence(10);
         my $y  = $x**2;
         $pl->xyplot($x, $y);
         $pl->close;

       Only version 5.15.0+ of PLplot is fully supported, due to a C-level API
       change that is invisible at PDL-level. However, the library does
       support installation with PLplot 5.13.0+.

       For more information on PLplot, see

        http://www.plplot.org/

       Also see the test file, t/plplot.t in this distribution for some
       working examples.

LONG NAMES
       If you are annoyed by the long constructor call, consider installing
       the aliased CPAN package. Using "aliased", the above example becomes

         use PDL;
         use aliased 'PDL::Graphics::PLplot';

         my $pl = PLplot->new (DEV => "png", FILE => "test.png");
         my $x  = sequence(10);
         # etc, as above

DESCRIPTION
       This is the PDL interface to the PLplot graphics library.  It provides
       a familiar 'perlish' Object Oriented interface as well as access to the
       low-level PLplot commands from the C-API.

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported.  Most options can be used with any
       function.  A few are only supported on the call to 'new'.

   Options used upon creation of a PLplot object (with 'new'):
       BACKGROUND

       Set the color for index 0, the plot background

       DEV

       Set the output device type.  To see a list of allowed types, try:

         PDL::Graphics::PLplot->new();

          PDL::Graphics::PLplot->new(DEV => 'png', FILE => 'test.png');

       FILE

       Set the output file or display.  For file output devices, sets the
       output file name.  For graphical displays (like 'xwin') sets the name
       of the display, eg ('hostname.foobar.com:0')

          PDL::Graphics::PLplot->new(DEV => 'png',  FILE => 'test.png');
          PDL::Graphics::PLplot->new(DEV => 'xwin', FILE => ':0');

       OPTS

       Set plotting options.  See the PLplot documentation for the complete
       listing of available options.  The value of 'OPTS' must be a hash
       reference, whose keys are the names of the options.  For instance, to
       obtain PostScript fonts with the ps output device, use:

          PDL::Graphics::PLplot->new(DEV => 'ps', OPTS => {drvopt => 'text=1'});

       MEM

       This option is used in conjunction with "DEV => 'mem'".  This option
       takes as input a PDL image and allows one to 'decorate' it using
       PLplot.  The 'decorated' PDL image can then be written to an image file
       using, for example, PDL::IO::Pic.  This option may not be available if
       plplot does not include the 'mem' driver.

         # read in Earth image and draw an equator.
         my $pl = PDL::Graphics::PLplot->new (MEM => $earth, DEV => 'mem');
         my $x  = pdl(-180, 180);
         my $y  = zeroes(2);
         $pl->xyplot($x, $y,
                     BOX => [-180,180,-90,90],
                     VIEWPORT => [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0],
                     XBOX => '', YBOX => '',
                     PLOTTYPE => 'LINE');
         $pl->close;

       FRAMECOLOR

       Set color index 1, the frame color

       JUST

       A flag used to specify equal scale on the axes.  If this is not
       specified, the default is to scale the axes to fit best on the page.

         PDL::Graphics::PLplot->new(DEV => 'png',  FILE => 'test.png', JUST => 1);

       ORIENTATION

       The orientation of the plot:

         0 --   0 degrees (landscape mode)
         1 --  90 degrees (portrait mode)
         2 -- 180 degrees (seascape mode)
         3 -- 270 degrees (upside-down mode)

       Intermediate values (0.2) are acceptable if you are feeling daring.

         # portrait orientation
         PDL::Graphics::PLplot->new(DEV => 'png',  FILE => 'test.png', ORIENTATION => 1);

       PAGESIZE

       Set the size in pixels of the output page.

         # PNG 500 by 600 pixels
         PDL::Graphics::PLplot->new(DEV => 'png',  FILE => 'test.png', PAGESIZE => [500,600]);

       SUBPAGES

       Set the number of sub pages in the plot, [$nx, $ny]

         # PNG 300 by 600 pixels
         # Two subpages stacked on top of one another.
         PDL::Graphics::PLplot->new(DEV => 'png',  FILE => 'test.png', PAGESIZE => [300,600],
                                                     SUBPAGES => [1,2]);

   Options used after initialization (after 'new')
       BOX

       Set the plotting box in world coordinates.  Used to explicitly set the
       size of the plotting area.

        my $pl = PDL::Graphics::PLplot->new(DEV => 'png',  FILE => 'test.png');
        $pl->xyplot ($x, $y, BOX => [0,100,0,200]);

       CHARSIZE

       Set the size of text in multiples of the default size.  "CHARSIZE =>
       1.5" gives characters 1.5 times the normal size.

       COLOR

       Set the current color for plotting and character drawing.  Colors are
       specified not as color indices but as RGB triples.  Some pre-defined
       triples are included:

         BLACK        GREEN        WHEAT        BLUE
         RED          AQUAMARINE   GREY         BLUEVIOLET
         YELLOW       PINK         BROWN        CYAN
         TURQUOISE    MAGENTA      SALMON       WHITE
         ROYALBLUE    DEEPSKYBLUE  VIOLET       STEELBLUE1
         DEEPPINK     MAGENTA      DARKORCHID1  PALEVIOLETRED2
         TURQUOISE1   LIGHTSEAGREEN SKYBLUE     FORESTGREEN
         CHARTREUSE3  GOLD2        SIENNA1      CORAL
         HOTPINK      LIGHTCORAL   LIGHTPINK1   LIGHTGOLDENROD

        # These two are equivalent:
        $pl->xyplot ($x, $y, COLOR => 'YELLOW');
        $pl->xyplot ($x, $y, COLOR => [0,255,0]);

       CONTOURLABELS

       Control of labels for contour plots.

       Must either be 0 (turn off contour labels), 1 (turn on default contour
       labels) or a five element array:

        offset:  Offset of label from contour line (if set to 0.0, labels are printed on the lines). Default value is 0.006.
        size:    Font height for contour labels (normalized). Default value is 0.3.
        spacing: Spacing parameter for contour labels. Default value is 0.1.
        lexp:    If the contour numerical label is greater than 10^(lexp) or less than 10^(-lexp),
                 then the exponential format is used. Default value of lexp is 4.
        sigdig:  Number of significant digits. Default value is 2";

        $pl->shadeplot ($z, $nsteps, BOX => [-1, 1, -1, 1], PLOTTYPE => 'CONTOUR', CONTOURLABELS => [0.004, 0.2, 0.2, 4, 2]);
        $pl->shadeplot ($z, $nsteps, BOX => [-1, 1, -1, 1], PLOTTYPE => 'CONTOUR', CONTOURLABELS => 0); # turn off labels
        $pl->shadeplot ($z, $nsteps, BOX => [-1, 1, -1, 1], PLOTTYPE => 'CONTOUR', CONTOURLABELS => 1); # use default labels

       GRIDMAP

       Set a user-defined grid map.  This is an X and Y vector that tells what
       are the world coordinates for each pixel in $z It is used in
       'shadeplot' for non-standard mappings between the input 2D surface to
       plot and the world coordinates.  For example if your surface does not
       completely fill up the plotting window.

        my $z = $surface; # 2D PDL to plot (generated elsewhere)
        my $nlevels = 20;
        my ($nx, $ny) = $z->dims;
        my @zbounds = ($minx, $maxx, $miny, $maxy);

        # Map X coords linearly to X range, Y coords linearly to Y range
        my $xmap = ((sequence($nx)*(($zbounds[1] - $zbounds[0])/($nx - 1))) + $zbounds[0]);
        my $ymap = ((sequence($ny)*(($zbounds[3] - $zbounds[2])/($ny - 1))) + $zbounds[2]);
        $pl->shadeplot ($z, $nlevels, PALETTE => 'GREENRED', GRIDMAP => [$xmap, $ymap]);

       GRIDMAP2

       Set a user-defined two dimensional grid map.  These are 2D X and Y
       matrices that tell what are the world coordinates for each pixel in $z
       It is used in 'shadeplot' for non-standard mappings between the input
       2D surface to plot and the world coordinates, for example irregular
       grids like polar projections.

        my $r_pts     = 40;
        my $theta_pts = 40;
        my $pi        = 4*atan2(1,1);
        my $nlevels   = 20;

        my $r     = ((sequence ($r_pts)) / ($r_pts - 1))->dummy (1, $theta_pts);
        my $z     = $r;  # or any other 2D surface to plot...
        my $theta = ((2 * $pi / ($theta_pts - 2)) * sequence ($theta_pts))->dummy (0, $r_pts);
        my $xmap  = $r * cos ($theta);
        my $ymap  = $r * sin ($theta);

        $pl->shadeplot ($z, $nlevels, PLOTTYPE => 'CONTOUR',
                                      JUST     => 1,
                                      BOX      => [-1,1,-1,1],
                                      PALETTE  => 'GREENRED',
                                      GRIDMAP2 => [$xmap, $ymap]);

       LINEWIDTH

       Set the line width for plotting.  Values range from 1 to a device
       dependent maximum.

       LINESTYLE

       Set the line style for plotting.  Pre-defined line styles use values 1
       to 8, one being a solid line, 2-8 being various dashed patterns.

       MAJTICKSIZE

       Set the length of major ticks as a fraction of the default setting.
       One (default) means leave these ticks the normal size.

       MINTICKSIZE

       Set the length of minor ticks (and error bar terminals) as a fraction
       of the default setting.  One (default) means leave these ticks the
       normal size.

       NXSUB

       The number of minor tick marks between each major tick mark on the X
       axis.  Specify zero (default) to let PLplot compute this automatically.

       NYSUB

       The number of minor tick marks between each major tick mark on the Y
       axis.  Specify zero (default) to let PLplot compute this automatically.

       PALETTE

       Load pre-defined color map 1 color ranges.  Currently, values include:

         RAINBOW   -- from Red to Violet through the spectrum
         REVERSERAINBOW   -- Violet through Red
         GREYSCALE -- from black to white via grey.
         REVERSEGREYSCALE -- from white to black via grey.
         GREENRED  -- from green to red
         REDGREEN  -- from red to green

        # Plot x/y points with the z axis in color
        $pl->xyplot ($x, $y, PALETTE => 'RAINBOW', PLOTTYPE => 'POINTS', COLORMAP => $z);

       PLOTTYPE

       Specify which type of XY or shade plot is desired:

         LINE       -- A line
         POINTS     -- A bunch of symbols
         LINEPOINTS -- both

         or, for 'shadeplot':
         CONTOUR    -- A contour plot of 2D data
         SHADE      -- A shade plot of 2D data

       STACKED_BAR_COLORS

       For 'bargraph', request a stacked bar chart.  Must contain a reference
       to a perl list of color names or RGB triples.

        # $labels is a reference to a perl array with N x-axis labels
        # $values is an NxM PDL where M is the number of stacked bars (in this case 2,
        # since STACKED_BAR_COLORS contains two colors).
        $pl->bargraph($labels, $values, STACKED_BAR_COLORS => ['GREEN', [128,0,55]);

       SUBPAGE

       Set which subpage to plot on.  Subpages are numbered 1 to N.  A zero
       can be specified meaning 'advance to the next subpage' (just a call to
       pladv()).

         my $pl = PDL::Graphics::PLplot->new(DEV      => 'png',
                                               FILE     => 'test.png',
                                               SUBPAGES => [1,2]);
         $pl->xyplot ($x, $y, SUBPAGE => 1);
         $pl->xyplot ($a, $b, SUBPAGE => 2);

       SYMBOL

       Specify which symbol to use when plotting "PLOTTYPE => 'POINTS'".  A
       large variety of symbols are available, see:
       http://plplot.sourceforge.net/examples-data/demo07/x07.*.png, where *
       is 01 - 17.  You are most likely to find good plotting symbols in the
       800s: http://plplot.sourceforge.net/examples-data/demo07/x07.06.png

       SYMBOLSIZE

       Specify the size of symbols plotted in multiples of the default size
       (1).  Value are real numbers from 0 to large.

       TEXTPOSITION

       Specify the placement of text.  Either relative to border, specified
       as:

        [$side, $disp, $pos, $just]

       Where

         side = 't', 'b', 'l', or 'r' for top, bottom, left and right
         disp is the number of character heights out from the edge
         pos  is the position along the edge of the viewport, from 0 to 1.
         just tells where the reference point of the string is: 0 = left, 1 = right, 0.5 = center.

       or inside the plot window, specified as:

        [$x, $y, $dx, $dy, $just]

       Where

         x  = x coordinate of reference point of string.
         y  = y coordinate of reference point of string.
         dx   Together with dy, this specifies the inclination of the string.
              The baseline of the string is parallel to a line joining (x, y) to (x+dx, y+dy).
         dy   Together with dx, this specifies the inclination of the string.
         just Specifies the position of the string relative to its reference point.
              If just=0, the reference point is at the left and if just=1,
              it is at the right of the string. Other values of just give
              intermediate justifications.

        # Plot text on top of plot
        $pl->text ("Top label",  TEXTPOSITION => ['t', 4.0, 0.5, 0.5]);

        # Plot text in plotting area
        $pl->text ("Line label", TEXTPOSITION => [50, 60, 5, 5, 0.5]);

       TITLE

       Add a title on top of a plot.

        # Plot text on top of plot
        $pl->xyplot ($x, $y, TITLE => 'X vs. Y');

       UNFILLED_BARS

       For 'bargraph', if set to true then plot the bars as outlines in the
       current color and not as filled boxes

        # Plot text on top of plot
        $pl->bargraph($labels, $values, UNFILLED_BARS => 1);

       VIEWPORT

       Set the location of the plotting window on the page.  Takes a four
       element array ref specifying:

        xmin -- The coordinate of the left-hand edge of the viewport. (0 to 1)
        xmax -- The coordinate of the right-hand edge of the viewport. (0 to 1)
        ymin -- The coordinate of the bottom edge of the viewport. (0 to 1)
        ymax -- The coordinate of the top edge of the viewport. (0 to 1)

       You will need to use this to make color keys or insets.

        # Make a small plotting window in the lower left of the page
        $pl->xyplot ($x, $y, VIEWPORT => [0.1, 0.5, 0.1, 0.5]);

        # Also useful in creating color keys:
        $pl->xyplot   ($x, $y, PALETTE => 'RAINBOW', PLOTTYPE => 'POINTS', COLORMAP => $z);
        $pl->colorkey ($z, 'v', VIEWPORT => [0.93, 0.96, 0.15, 0.85]);

        # Plot an inset; first the primary data and then the inset. In this
        # case, the inset contains a selection of the orignal data
        $pl->xyplot ($x, $y);
        $pl->xyplot (where($x, $y, $x < 1.2), VIEWPORT => [0.7, 0.9, 0.6, 0.8]);

       XBOX

       Specify how to label the X axis of the plot as a string of option
       letters:

         a: Draws axis, X-axis is horizontal line (y=0), and Y-axis is vertical line (x=0).
         b: Draws bottom (X) or left (Y) edge of frame.
         c: Draws top (X) or right (Y) edge of frame.
         d: Plot labels as date / time. Values are assumed to be seconds since the epoch (as used by gmtime).
         f: Always use fixed point numeric labels.
         g: Draws a grid at the major tick interval.
         h: Draws a grid at the minor tick interval.
         i: Inverts tick marks, so they are drawn outwards, rather than inwards.
         l: Labels axis logarithmically. This only affects the labels, not the data,
            and so it is necessary to compute the logarithms of data points before
            passing them to any of the drawing routines.
         m: Writes numeric labels at major tick intervals in the
            unconventional location (above box for X, right of box for Y).
         n: Writes numeric labels at major tick intervals in the conventional location
            (below box for X, left of box for Y).
         s: Enables subticks between major ticks, only valid if t is also specified.
         t: Draws major ticks.

       The default is 'BCNST' which draws lines around the plot, draws major
       and minor ticks and labels major ticks.

        # plot two lines in a box with independent X axes labeled
        # differently on top and bottom
        $pl->xyplot($x1, $y, XBOX  => 'bnst',  # bottom line, bottom numbers, ticks, subticks
                             YBOX  => 'bnst'); # left line, left numbers, ticks, subticks
        $pl->xyplot($x2, $y, XBOX => 'cmst', # top line, top numbers, ticks, subticks
                             YBOX => 'cst',  # right line, ticks, subticks
                             BOX => [$x2->minmax, $y->minmax]);

       XERRORBAR

       Used only with "xyplot".  Draws horizontal error bars at all points
       ($x, $y) in the plot.  Specify a PDL containing the same number of
       points as $x and $y which specifies the width of the error bar, which
       will be centered at ($x, $y).

       XLAB

       Specify a label for the X axis.

       XTICK

       Interval (in graph units/world coordinates) between major x axis tick
       marks.  Specify zero (default) to allow PLplot to compute this
       automatically.

       YBOX

       Specify how to label the Y axis of the plot as a string of option
       letters.  See "XBOX".

       YERRORBAR

       Used only for xyplot.  Draws vertical error bars at all points ($x, $y)
       in the plot.  Specify a PDL containing the same number of points as $x
       and $y which specifies the width of the error bar, which will be
       centered at ($x, $y).

       YLAB

       Specify a label for the Y axis.

       YTICK

       Interval (in graph units/world coordinates) between major y axis tick
       marks.  Specify zero (default) to allow PLplot to compute this
       automatically.

       ZRANGE

       For "xyplot" (when "COLORMAP" is specified), for "shadeplot" and for
       "colorkey".  Normally, the range of the Z variable (color) is taken as
       "$z->minmax".  If a different range is desired, specify it in "ZRANGE",
       like so:

         $pl->shadeplot ($z, $nlevels, PALETTE => 'GREENRED', ZRANGE => [0,100]);

       or

METHODS
       These are the high-level, object oriented methods for PLplot.

   new
       Create an object representing a plot.

        Arguments:
        none.

        Supported options:
        BACKGROUND
        DEV
        FILE
        FRAMECOLOR
        JUST
        PAGESIZE
        SUBPAGES

         my $pl = PDL::Graphics::PLplot->new(DEV => 'png',  FILE => 'test.png');

   setparm
       Set options for a plot object.

        Arguments:
        none.

        Supported options:
        All options except:

        BACKGROUND
        DEV
        FILE
        FRAMECOLOR
        JUST
        PAGESIZE
        SUBPAGES

       (These must be set in call to 'new'.)

         $pl->setparm (TEXTSIZE => 2);

   xyplot
       Plot XY lines and/or points.  Also supports color scales for points.
       This function works with bad values.  If a bad value is specified for a
       points plot, it is omitted.  If a bad value is specified for a line
       plot, the bad value makes a gap in the line.  This is useful for
       drawing maps; for example $x and $y can be the continent boundary
       latitude and longitude.

        Arguments:
        $x, $y

        Supported options:
        All options except:

        BACKGROUND
        DEV
        FILE
        FRAMECOLOR
        JUST
        PAGESIZE
        SUBPAGES

       (These must be set in call to 'new'.)

         $pl->xyplot($x, $y, PLOTTYPE => 'POINTS', COLOR => 'BLUEVIOLET', SYMBOL => 1, SYMBOLSIZE => 4);
         $pl->xyplot($x, $y, PLOTTYPE => 'LINEPOINTS', COLOR => [50,230,30]);
         $pl->xyplot($x, $y, PALETTE => 'RAINBOW', PLOTTYPE => 'POINTS', COLORMAP => $z);

   stripplots
       Plot a set of strip plots with a common X axis, but with different Y
       axes.  Looks like a stack of long, thin XY plots, all line up on the
       same X axis.

        Arguments:
        $xs -- 1D PDL with common X axis values, length = N
        $ys -- reference to a list of 1D PDLs with Y-axis values, length = N
               or 2D PDL with N x M elements
        -- OR --
        $xs -- reference to a list of 1D PDLs with X-axis values
        $ys -- reference to a list of 1D PDLs with Y-axis values
        %opts -- Options hash

        Supported options:
        All options except:

         my $y1  = $x**2;
         my $y2  = sqrt($x);
         my $y3  = $x**3;
         my $y4  = sin(($x/20) * 2 * $pi);
         $ys  = cat($y1, $y2, $y3, $y4);

         # Here's something a bit different. Notice that different xs have
         # different lengths.

       In addition, COLOR may be specified as a reference to a list of colors.
       If this is done, the colors are applied separately to each plot.

       Also, the options Y_BASE and Y_GUTTER can be specified.  Y_BASE gives
       the Y offset of the bottom of the lowest plot (0-1, specified like a
       VIEWPORT, defaults to 0.1) and Y_GUTTER gives the gap between the
       graphs (0-1, default = 0.02).

   colorkey
       Plot a color key showing which color represents which value

        Arguments:
        $range   : A PDL which tells the range of the color values
        $orientation : 'v' for vertical color key, 'h' for horizontal

        Supported options:
        All options except:

        SUBPAGES

       (These must be set in call to 'new'.)

         # Plot X vs. Y with Z shown by the color.  Then plot
         # vertical key to the right of the original plot.
         $pl->xyplot ($x, $y, PALETTE => 'RAINBOW', PLOTTYPE => 'POINTS', COLORMAP => $z);
         $pl->colorkey ($z, 'v', VIEWPORT => [0.93, 0.96, 0.15, 0.85]);

   shadeplot
       Create a shaded contour plot of 2D PDL 'z' with 'nsteps' contour
       levels.  Linear scaling is used to map the coordinates of Z(X, Y) to
       world coordinates via the "BOX" option.

        Arguments:
        $z : A 2D PDL which contains surface values at each XY coordinate.
        $nsteps : The number of contour levels requested for the plot.

        Supported options:
        All options except:

        BACKGROUND
        DEV
        FILE
        FRAMECOLOR
        JUST
        PAGESIZE
        SUBPAGES

       (These must be set in call to 'new'.)

         # vertical key to the right of the original plot.
         # The BOX must be specified to give real coordinate values to the $z array.
         $pl->shadeplot ($z, $nsteps, BOX => [-1, 1, -1, 1], PALETTE => 'RAINBOW', ZRANGE => [0,100]);
         $pl->colorkey  ($z, 'v', VIEWPORT => [0.93, 0.96, 0.15, 0.85], ZRANGE => [0,100]);

   histogram
       Create a histogram of a 1-D variable.

        Arguments:
        $x : A 1D PDL
        $nbins : The number of bins to use in the histogram.

        Supported options:
        All options except:

        BACKGROUND
        DEV
        FILE
        FRAMECOLOR
        JUST
        PAGESIZE
        SUBPAGES

       (These must be set in call to 'new'.)

         $pl->histogram ($x, $nbins, BOX => [$min, $max, 0, 100]);

   histogram1
       Create a histogram of a 1-D variable.  This alternative to 'histogram'
       creates filled boxes and also handles Y-axis scaling better.

        Arguments:
        $x : A 1D PDL
        $nbins : The number of bins to use in the histogram.

        Supported options:
        All options except:

        BACKGROUND
        DEV
        FILE
        FRAMECOLOR
        JUST

        SUBPAGES

       (These must be set in call to 'new'.)

         $pl->histogram1 ($x, $nbins, COLOR => 'GREEN');

   bargraph
       Simple utility to plot a bar chart with labels on the X axis.  The
       usual options can be specified, plus one other:  MAXBARLABELS specifies
       the maximum number of labels to allow on the X axis.  The default is
       20.  If this value is exceeded, then every other label is plotted.  If
       twice MAXBARLABELS is exceeded, then only every third label is printed,
       and so on.

       if UNFILLED_BARS is set to true, then plot the bars as outlines and not
       as filled rectangles.

       A stacked bar graph can be created if the STACKED_BAR_COLORS option is
       set.  The option takes a reference to a perl list of color names or RGB
       triplets.  If this option is set, then $x should not be a 1-D PDL of N
       bar heights, but a 2D PDL of NxM where N is the number of bars and M is
       the number of colors in STACKED_BAR_COLORS.

        Arguments:
        $labels -- A reference to a perl list of strings.
        $values -- A PDL of values to be plotted.

        Supported options:
        All options except:

        BACKGROUND
        DEV
        FILE
        FRAMECOLOR
        JUST
        PAGESIZE
        SUBPAGES

       (These must be set in call to 'new'.)

         $labels = ['one', 'two', 'three'];
         $values = pdl(1, 2, 3);

         # Note if TEXTPOSITION is specified, it must be in 4 argument mode (border mode):
         # [$side, $disp, $pos, $just]
         #
         # Where side = 't', 'b', 'l', or 'r' for top, bottom, left and right
         #              'tv', 'bv', 'lv' or 'rv' for top, bottom, left or right perpendicular to the axis.
         #
         #     disp is the number of character heights out from the edge
         #     pos  is the position along the edge of the viewport, from 0 to 1.
         #     just tells where the reference point of the string is: 0 = left, 1 = right, 0.5 = center.
         #
         # The '$pos' entry will be ignored (computed by the bargraph routine)
         $pl->bargraph($labels, $values, MAXBARLABELS => 30, TEXTPOSITION => ['bv', 0.5, 1.0, 1.0]);

         # A stacked bar chart:
         $labels = ['label1', 'label2', 'label3'];
         $values = pdl([[50,40,60],   # green bars
                        [20,10,30]]); # purple ([128, 0, 56]) bars
         $pl->bargraph ($labels, $values, STACKED_BAR_COLORS => ['GREEN', [128, 0, 56]])

   text
       Write text on a plot.  Text can either be written with respect to the
       borders or at an arbitrary location and angle (see the "TEXTPOSITION"
       entry).

        Arguments:
        $t : The text.

        Supported options:
        All options except:

        BACKGROUND
        DEV

         $pl->text("Count", COLOR => 'PINK',
                   TEXTPOSITION => ['t', 3, 0.5, 0.5]); # top, 3 units out, string ref. pt in
                                                        # center of string, middle of axis

   close
       Close a PLplot object, writing out the file and cleaning up.

       Arguments: None

       Returns: Nothing

       This closing of the PLplot object can be done explicitly though the
       'close' method.  Alternatively, a DESTROY block does an automatic close
       whenever the PLplot object passes out of scope.

         $pl->close;

FUNCTIONS
       The PDL low-level interface to the PLplot library closely mimics the C
       API.  Users are referred to the PLplot User's Manual, distributed with
       the source PLplot tarball.  This manual is also available on-line at
       the PLplot web site (<http://www.plplot.org/>).

       There are three differences in the way the functions are called.  The
       first one is due to a limitation in the pp_def wrapper of PDL, which
       forces all the non-ndarray arguments to be at the end of the arguments
       list.  It is the case of strings ("char *") arguments in the C API.
       This affects the following functions:

         plaxes
         plbox
         plbox3
         plmtex
         plmtex3
         plstart
         plstripc
         plmap
         plmeridians
         plshades
         plshade1

       This difference can be got around by a call to

         plplot_use_standard_argument_order(1);

       This re-arranges the string arguments to their proper/intuitive
       position compared with the C plplot interface.  This can be restored to
       its default by calling:

         plplot_use_standard_argument_order(0);

       The second notable different between the C and the PDL APIs is that
       many of the PDL calls do not need arguments to specify the size of the
       the vectors and/or matrices being passed.  These size parameters are
       deduced from the size of the ndarrays, when possible and are just
       omitted from the C call when translating it to perl.

       The third difference has to do with output parameters.  In C these are
       passed in with the input parameters.  In the perl interface, they are
       omitted.  For example:

       C:

         pllegend(&p_legend_width, &p_legend_height,
                  opt, position, x, y, plot_width, bg_color, bb_color, bb_style, nrow, ncolumn, nlegend,
                  opt_array,
                  text_offset, text_scale, text_spacing, text_justification,
                  text_colors, (const char **)text, box_colors, box_patterns, box_scales, box_line_widths,
                  line_colors, line_styles, line_widths, symbol_colors, symbol_scales, symbol_numbers, (const char **)symbols);

       perl:

         my ($legend_width, $legend_height) =
           pllegend ($position, $opt, $x, $y, $plot_width, $bg_color, $nlegend,
           \@opt_array,
           $text_offset, $text_scale, $text_spacing, $test_justification,
           \@text_colors, \@text, \@box_colors, \@box_patterns, \@box_scales, \@line_colors,
           \@line_styles, \@line_widths, \@symbol_colors, \@symbol_scales, \@symbol_numbers, \@symbols);

       Some of the API functions implemented in PDL have other specificities
       in comparison with the C API and will be discussed below.

   plline
        Signature: (x(n); y(n))
        Types: (double)

       Draws line segments along (x1,y1)->(x2,y2)->(x3,y3)->...

       If the nth value of either x or y are bad, then it will be skipped,
       breaking the line.  In this way, you can specify multiple line segments
       with a single pair of x and y ndarrays.

       The usage is straight-forward:

        plline($x, $y);

       For example:

        # Draw a sine wave
        $x = sequence(100)/10;
        $y = sin($x);

        # Draws the sine wave:
        plline($x, $y);

        # Set values above 3/4 to 'bad', effectively drawing a bunch of detached,
        # capped waves
        $y->setbadif($y > 3/4);
        plline($x, $y);

        Types: (double)

       PDL-specific: Implements what amounts to a threaded version of plsym.

       Bad values for z are simply skipped; all other bad values are not
       processed.

       In the following usage, all of the ndarrays must have the same
       dimensions:

        plcolorpoints($x, $y, $z, $symbol_index, $minz, $maxz)

       For example:

        # Generate a parabola some points
        my $x = sequence(30) / 3;   # Regular sampling
        my $y = $x**2;              # Parabolic y
        my $z = 30 - $x**3;         # Cubic coloration
        my $symbols = floor($x);    # Use different symbols for each 1/3 of the plot
                                    #  These should be integers.

        plcolorpoints($x, $y, $z, $symbols, -5, 20);  # Thread over everything
        plcolorpoints($x, $y, 1, 1, -1, 2);           # same color and symbol for all

       subroutine to do the label translation:

         my $labeltext = perl_labelfunc($axis, $value, $length);

       No 'data' argument is used, it is assumed that global data or a closure
       containing necessary data can be used in 'perl_labelfunc'.

WARNINGS AND ERRORS
       PLplot gives many errors and warnings.  Some of these are given by the
       PDL interface while others are internal PLplot messages.  Below are
       some of these messages, and what you need to do to address them:

       •   Box must be a ref to a four element array

           When specifying a box, you must pass a reference to a four-element
           array, or use an anonymous four-element array.

            # Gives trouble:
            $pl->xyplot($x, $y, BOX => (0, 0, 100, 200) );
            # What you meant to say was:
            $pl->xyplot($x, $y, BOX => [0, 0, 100, 200] );

       •   Too many colors used! (max 15)
