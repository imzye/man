NAME
       Crypt::Caesar - Decrypt rot-N strings

SYNOPSIS
           use Crypt::Caesar;
           print caesar("Vn tjp xvi nzz, do rjmfn.\n");

DESCRIPTION
       This module is based on the caesar utility from the bsdgames package,
       made by Stan King and John Eldridge, based on the algorithm suggested
       by Bob Morris.

       The caesar utility attempts to decrypt caesar cyphers using English
       letter frequency statistics.

   "caesar"
       This is the only function this package provides. It is exported by
       default and prototyped "($)".
