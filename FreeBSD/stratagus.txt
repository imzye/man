DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the flags that you can give to
       stratagus , formerly known as FreeCraft, formerly known as ALE Clone.

       stratagus is a powerful game engine for building realtime strategy
       games, a la AoE or Warcraft.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       -a     Enables asserts check in engine code (for debugging)

       -c file.lua
              Choose a different stratagus start config file.

       -d datapath
              Choose a different directory to use for game data files.

       -D depth
              Set the video mode depth, often called 'bpp' or 'bits per
              pixel'. This option is only valid for Win32/NT.

       -e     Start the editor included in Stratagus.

       -E     Choose a different editor config file.

       -F     With this option you can start Stratagus in full screen video
              mode.

       -G lua options
              The argument is passed as argument string to the lua game
              script. Take care to quote if spaces are used. This can be used
              in conjunction with -c to have custom startup routines with
              arguments.

       -h     Show summary of all options.

       -i     Enables unit info dumping into log (for debugging).

       -I addr
              With this option you can specify the network address for network
              play.

       -l     Disable command log messages.

       -N name
              The name of the player (will appear in network games).

       -o     Do not use OpenGL or OpenGL ES 1.1.

       -O     Use OpenGL or OpenGL ES 1.1.

       -p     Enables debug messages.

       -P port
              With this option you can set the network port to use in network
              games.  The default value is port udp/6660.

       -s number
              Number of frames before AI awakes. This is useful if the AI is
              too strong and you want it to react slower. The higher, the
              easier will be the game against the AI. Default is to sleep 0
              time frames.

       -S number
              Sync speed (100 = 30 frames/s).

       -v mode
              With this option you can specify video mode resolution in format
              <xres>x<yres>

       -W     With this option you can start Stratagus in windowed video mode.

       -x filter-idx
              In OpenGL mode, this controls the pixel scaling algorithm that
              is run on the entire display. This runs on the GPU Fragment
              shader, so your card and driver need to support at least OpenGL
              1.3.
                -1 - OpenGL native texture scaling (disables scaling in the
              shader)
                1  - nearest neighbour
                2  - EPX/AdvMame
                3  - HQx
                4  - SAL
                5  - SuperEagle

              This is especially useful in combination with -Z, since that
              will keep the original size of all elements on the screen at the
              ratio they have at 640x480, but scales everything to the chosen
              video resolution using the nice pixel scaler. To try which
              scaler looks best at run-time, you can use Ctrl+Alt+/ to cycle
              between scalers.

       -Z     Use OpenGL to scale the screen to the viewport. This is nice for
              games with assets only in one resolution, where higher screen
              resolutions shouldn't make everything smaller, but instead
              everything should be scaled up. Implies -O. Use with -x to get
              nicer pixel scaling.

NOTES
       Stratagus needs a lot of data (maps and artwork), that can come from
       external datasets, like Battle of Survival (BoS), or even from the
       media in the Warcraft II CD, thanks to the Wargus dataset.

       Warcraft II is a registered trademark of Blizzard Entertainment.
