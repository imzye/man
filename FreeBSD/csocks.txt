NAME
       csocks - Script that LD_PRELOAD a socks v4/v5 library for socksify
       applications


SYNOPSYS
       csocks     [BinaryApplication]



DESCRIPTION
       csocks
        Csocks (csocks is abbreviation for "Client Socks") is a Unix/Posix
       Socks4/5 client that supports many features. SOCKS is an Internet
       protocol that allows client-server applications to transparently use
       the services of a network firewall. SOCKS is an abbreviation for
       "SOCKetS". Clients behind a firewall, needing to access exterior
       servers, may connect to a SOCKS proxy server instead. Such proxy server
       controls the eligibility of the client to access the external server
       and passes the request on to the server. SOCKS can also be used in the
       opposite way, allowing the clients outside the firewall ("exterior
       clients") to connect to servers inside the firewall (internal servers).
       Coscks is not a binary program, csocks is a simple shared library that
       "maskerades" the socket system calls used by the programs which you
       want socksify. The force of csocks is the stability, the optimization
       speed and the affidability (for example csocks socksify fine Firefox
       and applet Java..) compared with other famouse socks client like DANTE
       socks client, RUNSOCKS socks client, TSOCKS socks client. Moreover
       CSOCKS work fine with a big number of applications that i tested it,
       like Mozilla Firefox, Java, Javascript, Safari etc. Csocks is easy to
       use and soon will support a new security features implemented with ss5
       (See http://ss5.sourceforge.net). You can configure the user-name and
       password for socks5 connections (see ENVIRONMENT). The features
       implemented are:

       SOCKS4 (all functions): CONNECT, BIND

       SOCKS5 : CONNECT, BIND, UDP ASSOCIATE, USER AUTHENTICATION



ENVIRONMENT
       In the "csocks.conf" configuration file you can indicate the username
       (socks4 and 5) and password (only socks5) used globally. In alternative
       you can set CSOCKS_USER and CSOCKS_PASSWD environment (in this case the
       global declarations in csocks.conf are ignored).


EXAMPLE
       CSOCKS is easy to use: if you want to socksify your favorite
       application (f.e. ssh), simple you must write the command:

       csocks ssh 152.33.28.56

       Starting from version 1.5 csocks support IPv6 rules (sperimental) and
       socksify IPv6 connections

       csocks ssh fe80::242:3hff:fe54:e7e6%bge0



       Before this, you must configure the CSOCKS configuration file (usually
       is /usr/local/etc/csocks.conf in FreeBSD and /etc/csocks.conf in
       Linux). See manpage csocks.conf (5)
