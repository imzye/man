DESCRIPTION
       wtype is a Wayland tool that allows you to simulate keyboard input like
       xdotool type for X11.  This is accomplished via the virtual-keyboard
       Wayland protocol.


OPTIONS
       Modifier can be one of "shift", "capslock", "ctrl", "logo", "win",
       "alt", "altgr".  Beware that the modifiers get released automatically
       once the program terminates.

       Named keys are resolved by libxkbcommon, valid identifiers include
       "Left" and "Home".


       -M MOD Press modifier MOD.


       -m MOD Release modifier MOD.


       -P KEY Press key KEY.


       -p KEY Release key KEY.


       -k KEY Type (press and release) key KEY.


       -d TIME
              Sleep for TIME milliseconds between keystrokes when typing
              texts.  Can be used multiple times, default 0.

       -s TIME
              Sleep for TIME milliseconds before interpreting the following
              options. This can be used to perform more complicated modifier
              sequences.


       -      Read text to type from stdin. This option can appear only once.


BUGS
       No known bugs.
