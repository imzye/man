DESCRIPTION
       This module is now deprecated.

       It is superseded and replaced by Syntax::Kamelon.  Best use
       Syntax::Kamelon for new projects.

       Syntax::Highlight::Engine::Kate is a port to Perl of the syntax
       highlight engine of the Kate text editor.

       The language XML files of Kate have been rewritten to Perl modules
       using a script. These modules function as plugins to this module.

       Syntax::Highlight::Engine::Kate inherits
       Syntax::Highlight::Engine::Kate::Template.

OPTIONS
       language
           Specify the language you want highlighted. Look in the PLUGINS
           section for supported languages.

       plugins
           If you created your own language plugins you may specify a list of
           them with this option.

            plugins => [
              ["MyModuleName", "MyLanguageName", "*,ext1;*.ext2", "Section"],
              ....
            ]

       format_table
           This option must be specified if the highlightText method needs to
           do anything useful for you.  All mentioned keys in the synopsis
           must be specified.

       substitutions
           With this option you can specify additional formatting options.

METHODS
       extensions
           Returns a reference to the extensions hash.

       language(?$language?)
           Sets and returns the current language that is highlighted. When
           setting the language a reset is also done.

       languageAutoSet($filename)
           Suggests language name for the given file $filename.

       languageList
           Returns a list of languages for which plugins have been defined.

       languagePlug($language, ?$insensitive?)
           Returns the module name of the plugin for $language.

           If $insensitive is set it will also try to match names ignoring
           case and return the correct module name of the plugin.

           e.g. "$highlighter->languagePlug('HtMl', 1);" will return "HTML".

       languagePropose($filename)
           Suggests language name for the given file $filename.

       sections
           Returns a reference to the sections hash.

ATTRIBUTES
       In the Kate XML syntax files you find under the section <itemDatas>
       entries like "<itemData name="Unknown Property" defStyleNum="dsError"
       italic="1"/>". Kate is an editor so it is ok to have definitions for
       foreground and background colors and so on. However, since this module
       is supposed to be a more universal highlight engine, the attributes
       need to be fully abstract. In which case, Kate does not have enough
       default attributes defined to fulfill all needs. Kate defines the
       following standard attributes:

       •   dsNormal

       •   dsKeyword

       •   dsDataType

       •   dsDecVal

       •   dsBaseN

       •   dsFloat

       •   dsChar

       •   dsString

       •   dsComment

       •   dsOthers

       •   dsAlert

       •   dsFunction

       •   dsRegionMarker

       •   dsError

       This module leaves out the <ds> part and uses following additional
       attributes:

       •   BString

       •   IString

       •   Operator

       •   Reserved

       •   Variable

       I have modified the XML files so that each highlight mode would get its
       own attribute. In quite a few cases still not enough attributes were
       defined. So in some languages different modes have the same attribute.

PLUGINS
       Below is an overview of existing plugins. All have been tested on use
       and can be created. The ones for which no sample file is available are
       marked. Those marked OK have highlighted the test file without apparent
       mistakes. This does not mean that all bugs are shaken out.

       Module Syntax::Highlight::Engine::Kate::Convert::ToolKit and script hl-
       kate-convert can be used to convert existing Kate/KTextEditor Syntax
       Highlighting file from XML format to Perl.

BUGS
       Float is detected differently than in the Kate editor.

       The regular expression engine of the Kate editor, qregexp, appears to
       be more tolerant to mistakes in regular expressions than Perl. This
       might lead to error messages and differences in behaviour.  Most of the
       problems were sorted out while developing, because error messages
       appeared. For as far as differences in behaviour is concerned, testing
       is the only way to find out, so I hope the users out there will be able
       to tell me more.

       This module is mimicking the behaviour of the syntax highlight engine
       of the Kate editor. If you find a bug/mistake in the highlighting,
       please check if Kate behaves in the same way. If yes, the cause is
       likely to be found there.

TO DO
       Rebuild the scripts I am using to generate the modules from XML files
       so they are more pro-actively tracking flaws in the build of the XML
       files like missing lists. Also regular expressions in the XML can be
       tested better before they are used in plugins.

       Refine the test methods in Syntax::Highlight::Engine::Kate::Template,
       so that choices for case sensitivity, dynamic behaviour and lookahead
       can be determined at generate time of the plugin, might increase
       throughput.

       Implement code folding.
