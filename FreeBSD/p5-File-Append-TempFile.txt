File::Append::TempFile(3)                  User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       File::Append::TempFile - Perl extension for appending data to files

SYNOPSIS
         use File::Append::TempFile;

         $f = new File::Append::TempFile();
         $f->begin_work('/etc/hosts') or die "Appending: ".$f->err();
         $f->add_line("127.0.0.2 localhvost\n");
         $f->commit();

         $f->begin_work('/etc/hosts') or die "Appending: ".$f->err();
         $f->add_line("...\n");
         $f->rollback();

DESCRIPTION
       The "File::Append::TempFile" module provides an OOP interface to
       appending data to files using a temporary file, in order to ensure the
       atomicity of the updates.

       An append session is initiated by invoking the begin_work() method and
       passing it the name of the file.  At this point, a temporary file is
       created in the same directory as the original file and the original's
       contents is copied to the temporary.  More data is added to the
       temporary file using the add_line() method.  When done appending, the
       commit() method will atomically move the temporary file over the
       original.  If something goes wrong, the rollback() method will remove
       the temporary file without affecting the original in any way.

METHODS
       The "File::Append::TempFile" class defines the following methods:

       new ()
           Create a new "File::Append::TempFile" object.  No file processing
           is done at this point.

       err ( [MESSAGE] )
           Set or obtain an error message describing the last error that
           occurred during the processing of the current
           "File::Append::TempFile" object.

       diag ([FLAG])
           Set or obtain the diagnostic output flag.  If it is set, the
           methods will display diagnostic information on the standard error
           stream.

       begin_work (FILENAME)
           Creates a temporary file in the same directory as the specified one
           and copies the original's contents over to the new file.  Further
           data may be added using the add_line() method and then either
           stored as the original with the commit() method, or discarded with
           the rollback() method.

       add_line (DATA)
           Append data to the temporary file.  This does not affect the
           original in any way until commit() is invoked.

       commit ()
           Replace the original file with the temporary copy, to which data
           may have been added using add_line().

           NOTE: This method uninitializes the "File::Append::TempFile"
           object, that is, removes any association between it and the
           original file and even file name!  The next method invoked on this
           "File::Append::TempFile" object should be begin_work().

       rollback ()
           Discard all the changes made to the temporary copy and remove it.
           This does not affect the original file in any way.

           NOTE: This method uninitializes the "File::Append::TempFile"
           object, that is, removes any association between it and the
           original file and even file name!  The next method invoked on this
           "File::Append::TempFile" object should be begin_work().

       There are also several methods used internally by the
       "File::Append::TempFile" routines:

       debug (MESSAGE)
           Display a diagnostic message to the standard error stream if the
           output of diagnostic messages has been enabled.

       do_copy (ORIG TEMP)
           Actually perform the copying of the original file data into the
           temporary file at begin_work() time.  This allows derived classes
           to modify the file structure if needed.

           The two parameters are the file handles for the original and the
           temporary file.

BUGS
       •   Note that the original file may have changed between begin_work()
           and commit() - those changes will be lost!
