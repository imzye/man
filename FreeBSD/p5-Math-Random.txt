NAME
       Math::Random - Random Number Generators

SYNOPSIS
       •


            use Math::Random;

           Exports the following routines by default (see "Default Routines"):

            random_set_seed_from_phrase
            random_get_seed
            random_seed_from_phrase
            random_set_seed
            random_uniform
            random_uniform_integer
            random_permutation
            random_permuted_index
            random_normal

           In this case the extended routines (see "Extended Routines") can be
           used by    qualifying  them  explicitly  with "Math::Random::",
           for example: "$stdexp = Math::Random::random_exponential();"

DESCRIPTION
       Math::Random is  a Perl port  of the C version of randlib, which is   a
       suite of  routines for  generating  random deviates.  See "RANDLIB" for
       more information.

       This port supports all of the distributions  from which the Fortran and
       C  versions generate deviates.   The major functionalities that are
       excluded  are   the  multiple  generators/splitting  facility  and
       antithetic  random number  generation.   These facilities,  along with
       some of  the distributions which are  included, are probably not of
       interest   except  to the   very  sophisticated   user.  If there   is
       sufficient interest, the excluded   facilities will be included in   a
       future  release.   The code  to   perform the  excluded facilities  is
       available as randlib in Fortran and C source.

   Default Routines
       The routines which are exported by default are  the only ones that the
       average Perl programmer is likely to need.

       random_set_seed_from_phrase($phrase)
           Sets  the  seed   of the  base  generator  to   a  value determined
           by $phrase.  If  the module is installed with  the default option,
           the value depends on the  machine collating sequence.  It should,
           however, be the  same for 7-bit ASCII character  strings on all
           ASCII machines.  In the  original randlib, the value  generated for
           a given $phrase was consistent from implementation to
           implementation  (it did not rely on the machine collating
           sequence).  Check with your Perl administrator to see if the module
           was installed with the original seed generator.  Note:  When the
           Perl processor loads package  Math::Random  the seed  is set   to a
           value  based on  the current time.  The seed  changes  each time
           Math::Random  generates something random.

           The ability to set the seed is useful for debugging,  or for those
           who like reproducible runs.

       random_get_seed()
           Returns  an   array of  length two  which  contains  the  two
           integers constituting  the seed   (assuming   a call   in array
           context).  An invocation   in  a scalar  context  returns   the
           integer 2, which is probably not useful.

       random_seed_from_phrase($phrase)
           Returns   an  array of  length  two which  contains   the two
           integers constituting   the seed  (assuming a    call  in array
           context).   An invocation   in  a scalar  context returns  the
           integer  2, which is probably not useful.  The  seed generated is
           the seed  used to set the seed in a  call to
           "random_set_seed_from_phrase".

           Note:   the  following  two calls  (for   the  same $phrase) are
           equivalent:

            random_set_seed(random_seed_from_phrase($phrase));

           and

            random_set_seed_from_phrase($phrase);

       random_set_seed(@seed)
           Sets  the  seed  of the  base  generator  to  the value @seed[0,1].
           Usually, the  argument  @seed should be  the result  of  a  call to
           "random_get_seed"  or "random_seed_from_phrase".  @seed[0,1] must
           be two integers in the range (1, 1) to (2147483562, 2147483398),
           inclusive.

       "random_uniform($n, $low, $high)"
       random_uniform($n)
       random_uniform()
           When called  in an array context,  returns an array of  $n deviates
           generated from   a uniform($low, $high) distribution.    When
           called in  a scalar context,    generates and returns only  one
           such deviate as a scalar, regardless of the value of $n.

           Argument restrictions: $low must be less than or equal to $high.

           Defaults are  (1, 0, 1).    Note:  $high must   be specified if
           $low is specified.

       "random_uniform_integer($n, $low, $high)"
           When called  in an array context,  returns  an array of  $n integer
           deviates generated from  a  uniform($low, $high) distribution on
           the   integers.  When called   in a  scalar context, generates  and
           returns only one such deviate as a  scalar, regardless of the value
           of $n.

           Argument  restrictions: $low and $high  are  first rounded using
           int(); the resulting $low must be less than or equal to $high, and
           the resulting  range ($high - $low)  must not  be  greater than
           2147483561.

           There are no defaults; all three arguments must be provided.

       random_permutation(@array)
           Returns @array, randomly permuted.

       random_permuted_index($n)
           Returns  an array  of  array indices, randomly  permuted.  The
           indices used are (0, ... ,($n -  1)).  This produces the indices
           used by "random_permutation" for a given seed, without passing
           arrays.

           Note: the following are equivalent:

            random_set_seed_from_phrase('jjv');
            random_permutation(@array);

           and

            random_set_seed_from_phrase('jjv');
            @array[(random_permuted_index(scalar(@array)))];

       "random_normal($n, $av, $sd)"
       "random_normal($n, $av)"
       random_normal($n)
       random_normal()
           When called in  an array context, returns  an array  of $n deviates
           generated from a normal($av, $sd^2) distribution.  When called in a
           scalar context,  generates  and returns  only one  such   deviate
           as a scalar, regardless of the value of $n.

           Argument restrictions: $sd must be non-negative.

           Defaults are (1, 0, 1).

   Extended Routines
       These routines generate deviates from many other distributions.

       Note: The parameterizations of these deviates are standard (insofar as
       there is a  standard ...  ) but  particular attention  should be paid
       to the distributions of the beta  and gamma deviates (noted in
       "random_beta" and "random_gamma" below).

       "random_beta($n, $aa, $bb)"
           When called in an array  context, returns an  array of $n  deviates
           generated from  the  beta distribution  with parameters  $aa and
           $bb.  The density of the beta is:

           X^($aa - 1) * (1 - X)^($bb - 1) / B($aa , $bb) for 0 < X < 1.

           When called in  a scalar context, generates  and returns only one
           such deviate as a scalar, regardless of the value of $n.

           Argument restrictions:  Both $aa and $bb must  not  be less than
           1.0E-37.

           There are no defaults; all three arguments must be provided.

       "random_binomial($n, $nt, $p)"
           When called  in an array context,  returns an array  of $n outcomes
           generated  from the  binomial  distribution with  number  of trials
           $nt and probability of an  event in each  trial $p.  When called in
           a scalar context, generates and returns  only one such outcome as a
           scalar, regardless of the value of $n.

           Argument restrictions: $nt  is rounded  using int(); the  result
           must be non-negative.  $p must be between 0 and 1 inclusive.

           There are no defaults; both arguments must be provided.

       "random_chi_square($n, $df)"
           When called in an  array context, returns an  array of $n  deviates
           generated from the chi-square  distribution with $df degrees  of
           freedom.  When called in a  scalar context, generates and returns
           only one such deviate as a scalar, regardless of the value of $n.

           Argument restrictions: $df must be positive.

           There are no defaults; both arguments must be provided.

       "random_exponential($n, $av)"
       random_exponential($n)
       random_exponential()
           When  called in an  array context, returns  an array of $n deviates
           generated from the exponential distribution with mean $av.  When
           called    in a scalar  context, generates   and  returns only one
           such deviate as a scalar, regardless of the value of $n.

           Argument restrictions: $av must be non-negative.

           Defaults are (1, 1).

       "random_f($n, $dfn, $dfd)"
           When called  in an array  context, returns an  array of $n deviates
           generated from the F  (variance ratio) distribution with degrees of
           freedom $dfn (numerator) and $dfd (denominator).  When called in a
           scalar context,  generates and  returns only  one such deviate  as
           a scalar, regardless of the value of $n.

           Argument restrictions: Both $dfn and $dfd must be positive.

           There are no defaults; all three arguments must be provided.

       "random_gamma($n, $a, $r)"
           When called in  an array context, returns  an array of  $n deviates
           generated from  the  gamma distribution  with  parameters $a and
           $r.  The density of the gamma is:

           ($a**$r) / Gamma($r) * X**($r - 1) * Exp(-$a*X)

           When called in  a scalar context, generates and  returns only one
           such deviate as a scalar, regardless of the value of $n.

           Argument restrictions: Both $a and $r must be positive.

           There are no defaults; all three arguments must be provided.

       "random_multinomial($n, @p)"
           When called in an array  context, returns single observation from
           the multinomial distribution, with $n events classified into as
           many categories as the length of @p.   The probability of an event
           being classified into category i is given by the ith element of @p.
           The observation is an array with length equal to @p, so when called
           in a scalar  context it  returns  the length  of @p.   The sum of
           the elements of the observation is equal to $n.

           Argument  restrictions: $n is  rounded  with int() before it  is
           used; the  result  must be  non-negative.   @p must have  length at
           least 2.  All elements of @p except the  last must be between 0 and
           1  inclusive, and sum to  no  more than   0.99999.  Note: The  last
           element of @p is a dummy to indicate  the number of categories, and
           it is adjusted to bring the sum of the elements of @p to 1.

           There are no defaults; both arguments must be provided.

       "random_multivariate_normal($n, @mean, @covar)"
           When  called in an array context,  returns  an array of $n deviates
           (each   deviate  being    an  array  reference) generated   from
           the multivariate  normal  distribution with  mean  vector @mean
           and variance-covariance  matrix  @covar.     When called  in  a
           scalar context,  generates and  returns only  one  such  deviate
           as an array reference, regardless of the value of $n.

           Argument restrictions: If the dimension of the deviate to be
           generated is p,  @mean  should be a   length p array  of real
           numbers.  @covar should be  a length p array of  references to
           length p arrays of real  numbers  (i.e.  a  p  by  p  matrix).
           Further, @covar should be a symmetric positive-definite matrix,
           although the Perl code does  not check positive-definiteness, and
           the underlying C code    assumes  the  matrix  is   symmetric.
           Given that   the variance-covariance matrix is  symmetric, it
           doesn't matter if   the references  refer   to rows  or columns.
           If  a non-positive definite matrix is passed  to the function,  it
           will abort with the  following message:

            COVM not positive definite in SETGMN

           Also,  a    non-symmetric   @covar may    produce  deviates without
           complaint,  although they may not  be  from the expected
           distribution.  For  these reasons, you  are   encouraged  to verify
           the  arguments passed.

           The Perl code does   check  the dimensionality of @mean   and
           @covar for consistency.  It does so by  checking that the length of
           the argument  vector  passed is  odd,  that  what  should be the
           last element of @mean and the first element  of @covar look like
           they are a number followed by an array reference respectively, and
           that the arrays referred to in @covar are as long as @mean.

           There are no defaults; all three arguments must be provided.

       "random_negative_binomial($n, $ne, $p)"
           When  called in an  array context, returns  an array of $n outcomes
           generated from the  negative  binomial distribution with number  of
           events $ne and  probability of an event  in each trial $p.  When
           called  in  a scalar   context, generates  and  returns only  one
           such outcome as a scalar, regardless of the value of $n.

           Argument restrictions: $ne is   rounded using int(), the  result
           must be positive.  $p must be between 0 and 1 exclusive.

           There are no defaults; both arguments must be provided.

       "random_noncentral_chi_square($n, $df, $nonc)"
           When called in  an array context, returns  an array  of $n deviates
           generated  from the noncentral  chi-square distribution with $df
           degrees of freedom and noncentrality  parameter $nonc.  When called
           in a scalar context, generates and returns only  one such deviate
           as a scalar, regardless of the value of $n.

           Argument restrictions:   $df must be at  least  1, $nonc must be
           non-negative.

           There are no defaults; all three arguments must be provided.

       "random_noncentral_f($n, $dfn, $dfd, $nonc)"
           When called in  an array context, returns an  array of  $n deviates
           generated from the noncentral F  (variance ratio) distribution with
           degrees of freedom $dfn (numerator)  and $dfd (denominator); and
           noncentrality parameter $nonc.   When  called in a  scalar context,
           generates and returns only one such deviate as a scalar, regardless
           of the value of $n.

           Argument restrictions:  $dfn must  be at least   1, $dfd must be
           positive, and $nonc must be non-negative.

           There are no defaults; all four arguments must be provided.

       "random_poisson($n, $mu)"
           When called  in an array context,  returns an array  of $n outcomes
           generated  from the Poisson  distribution  with mean  $mu.  When
           called  in a  scalar   context, generates and  returns  only  one
           such outcome as a scalar, regardless of the value of $n.

           Argument restrictions: $mu must be non-negative.

           There are no defaults; both arguments must be provided.

ERROR HANDLING
       The Perl code should "croak" if bad arguments are passed or if the
       underlying C code  cannot allocate the  necessary memory.  The only
       error which should kill the job without  "croak"ing is a non-positive
       definite         variance-covariance      matrix      passed        to
       "random_multivarite_normal" (see "Extended Routines").

RANDLIB
       randlib  is available in Fortran and  C source form, and will soon be
       available in Fortran90 source as well.  randlib.c can be obtained from
       statlib.  Send mail   whose  message   is 'send randlib.c.shar from
       general' to:

                              statlib@lib.stat.cmu.edu

       randlib.c   can  also  be    obtained    by  anonymous  ftp   to:

                         odin.mdacc.tmc.edu (143.111.62.32)

       where it is available as

                          /pub/source/randlib.c-1.3.tar.gz

       For obvious reasons, the original randlib  (in Fortran) has been
       renamed to

                          /pub/source/randlib.f-1.3.tar.gz

       on the same machine.

       wrapper.c  (now  obsolete)   was  created   by  using SWIG,  and
       performing some modification of the result.  SWIG also produced the
       skeleton of Random.pm.

SOURCES
       The following routines,  which  were  written by others   and  lightly
       modified for consistency in packaging, are included in randlib.

       Bottom Level Routines
           These routines are a transliteration of the Pascal in the reference
           to Fortran, and thence to C.

VERSION
       This POD documents Math::Random version 0.71.

AUTHORS
       •   Math::Random (the Perl port  of Randlib) was put  together by John
           Venier  and Barry W. Brown with help from  SWIG.  For  version
           0.61, Geoffrey Rommel made various cosmetic changes. Version 0.64
           uses plain vanilla XS rather than SWIG.

       •   randlib was compiled and written  by  Barry W. Brown, James Lovato,
           Kathy Russell, and John Venier.

       •   Correspondence   regarding   Math::Random or   randlib should be
