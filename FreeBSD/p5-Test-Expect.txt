NAME
       Test::Expect - Automated driving and testing of terminal-based programs

SYNOPSIS
         # in a t/*.t file:
         use Test::Expect;
         use Test::More tests => 13;
         expect_run(
           command => ["perl", "testme.pl"],
           prompt  => 'testme: ',
           quit    => 'quit',
         );
         expect("ping", "pong", "expect");
         expect_send("ping", "expect_send");
         expect_is("* Hi there, to testme", "expect_is");
         expect_like(qr/Hi there, to testme/, "expect_like");

DESCRIPTION
       Test::Expect is a module for automated driving and testing of terminal-
       based programs.  It is handy for testing interactive programs which
       have a prompt, and is based on the same concepts as the Tcl Expect
       tool.  As in Expect::Simple, the Expect object is made available for
       tweaking.

       Test::Expect is intended for use in a test script.

SUBROUTINES
   expect_run
       The expect_run subroutine sets up Test::Expect. You must pass in the
       interactive program to run, what the prompt of the program is, and
       which command quits the program:

         expect_run(
           command => ["perl", "testme.pl"],
           prompt  => 'testme: ',
           quit    => 'quit',
         );

       The "command" may either be a string, or an arrayref of program and
       arguments; the latter for bypasses the shell.

   expect
       The expect subroutine is the catch all subroutine. You pass in the
       command, the expected output of the subroutine and an optional comment.

         expect("ping", "pong", "expect");

   expect_send
       The expect_send subroutine sends a command to the program. You pass in
       the command and an optional comment.

         expect_send("ping", "expect_send");

   expect_is
       The expect_is subroutine tests the output of the program like
       Test::More's is. It has an optional comment:

         expect_is("* Hi there, to testme", "expect_is");

   expect_like
       The expect_like subroutine tests the output of the program like
       Test::More's like. It has an optional comment:

         expect_like(qr/Hi there, to testme/, "expect_like");

   expect_handle
       This returns the Expect object.

   expect_quit
       Closes the Expect handle.
