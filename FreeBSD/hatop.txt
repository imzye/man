HATOP(1)                FreeBSD General Commands Manual               HATOP(1)

NAME
       HATop - interactive ncurses client for haproxy

SYNOPSIS
       hatop -s SOCKET [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       HATop is an interactive ncurses client and real-time monitoring,
       statistics displaying tool for the HAProxy TCP/HTTP load balancer.

       HATop's appearance is similar to top(1). It supports various modes for
       detailed statistics of all configured proxies and services in near
       realtime.  In addition, it features an interactive CLI for the haproxy
       unix socket.  This allows administrators to control the given haproxy
       instance (change server weight, put servers into maintenance mode, ...)
       directly out of hatop (using keybinds or the CLI) and monitor the
       results immediately.

       HATop uses a unix domain socket to communicate with HAProxy.  This can
       be configured in the HAProxy configuration using the "stats socket"
       option.  To enable all of HATop's features the "level" parameter of
       this option should be set to "admin".
