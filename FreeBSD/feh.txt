NAME
     feh – image viewer and cataloguer

SYNOPSIS
     feh [options] [--] [files | directories | URLs ...]

VERSION
     This manual documents feh 3.10.3

     Compile-time switches in this build:
     •   libcurl remote file support enabled
     •   Xinerama multi-monitor support enabled
     •   libexif builtin EXIF reader available
     •   inotify-based auto-reload of changed files disabled
     •   libmagic disabled

DESCRIPTION
     feh is a light-weight, configurable and versatile image viewer.  It is
     aimed at command line users, but can also be started from graphical file
     managers.  Apart from viewing images, it can compile text and thumbnail
     listings, show (un)loadable files, set X11 backgrounds, and more.

     Features include filelists, various image sorting modes, custom action
     scripts, and image captions.  feh can be controlled by configurable
     keyboard and mouse shortcuts, terminal input and signals.  When no file
     arguments or filelists are specified and --start-at is not used, feh
     displays all files in the current directory.

     EXIF tags are supported either using exiv2 / exifgrep via --info (see the
     USAGE EXAMPLES section), or as a builtin feature by compiling feh with
     exif=1. In this build of feh, builtin EXIF support is available.

MODES
     feh is based on various modes, which are selected at startup by command
     line options.

     Slideshow mode is the default.  It opens a window and displays the first
     image in it; the slideshow position can be advanced (or otherwise
     changed) using keyboard and mouse shortcuts.  In slideshow mode, images
     can be deleted either from the filelist or from the disk, a changed
     filelist can also be saved to the disk and reopened at a later time.  An
     image can also be read from stdin via "feh -".

     Montage mode forms a montage from the filelist.  The resulting image can
     be viewed or saved, and its size can be limited by height, width or both.

     Index mode forms an index print from the filelist.  Image thumbnails are
     shown along with the filename, size and dimensions, printed using a
     truetype font of your choice.  The resulting image can be viewed or
     saved, and its size can be limited by height, width or both.

     Thumbnail mode is like index mode, but the mini-images are clickable and
     open the selected image in a new window.

     Multiwindow mode shows images in multiple windows, instead of as a
     slideshow in one window.  Don't use with a large filelist ;)

     List mode doesn't display images.  Instead, it outputs an ls-style
     listing of the files in the filelist, including image info such as size,
     number of pixels, type, etc.  There is also a Customlist mode which
     prints image info in a custom format specified by a printf-like format
     string.

     feh can also list either all the loadable files in a filelist or all the
     unloadable files.  This is useful for preening a directory.

SUPPORTED FORMATS
     feh can open any format supported by imlib2, most notably jpeg, png, pnm,
     tiff, and bmp.  The gif format is also supported, but only for static
     images.  In case of animations, only the first frame will be shown.

     When invoked with --conversion-timeout timeout (and a non-negative
     timeout value), feh also has limited support for various other file types
     by means of external conversion programs.  If the dcraw binary is
     available, feh will use it to display the thumbnails embedded into RAW
     files provided by digital cameras and similar.  If the ImageMagick
     convert binary is available, feh will use it to load file types such as
     svg, xcf, and otf.

     (optional feature, disabled in this build) feh can use libmagic to only
     pass image files to Imlib2.  When using feh with lots of non-image files
     (especially with Imlib2 version 1.6.x or 1.7.0), this can speed up the
     detection of non-image files significantly.  If you think that Imlib2 can
     load a file which feh has determined to be likely not an image, set the
     environment variable "FEH_SKIP_MAGIC" to pass all files directly to
     Imlib2, bypassing this check.  The environment variable's value does not
     matter, it just needs to be set.

OPTIONS
     -A, --action [flag][[title]]action
             Specify a shell command as an action to perform on the image.  In
             slideshow or multiwindow mode, the action will be run when the
             action_0 key is pressed, in list mode, it will be run for each
             file.  In loadable/unloadable mode, it will be run for each
             loadable/unloadable file, respectively.  In thumbnail mode,
             clicking on an image will cause the action to run instead of
             opening the image.

             If flag is ";", feh will reload the current image instead of
             switching to the next one (slideshow mode) or closing the window
             (multiwindow mode) after executing the action.  If [title] is
             specified (note the literal "[" and "]"), --draw-actions will
             display title instead of action in the action list.  Note that
             title must not start with a space.  If it does, the action is
             handled as if it did not have a title.  This special case exists
             for backwards compatibility reasons and makes sure that actions
             like "[ -L %F ] && foo" still work.

             The action will be executed by /bin/sh.  Use format specifiers to
             refer to image info, see FORMAT SPECIFIERS for details.  Example
             usage: "feh -A "mv %F ~/images/%N" *".

     --action1 .. --action9 [flag][[title]]action
             Extra actions which can be set and triggered using the
             appropriate number key.

     --auto-reload
             (optional feature, disabled in this build) automatically reload
             image when the underlying file changes.  Note that auto-reload
             (if enabled in the build) is on by default.  This option is only
             useful to re-enable auto-reload after it has been disabled by a
             preceding --reload=0 option.

             Automatic reload is not supported in montage, index, or thumbnail
             mode.

     --auto-rotate
             (optional feature, available in this build) (deprecated in favor
             of Imlib2's auto-orientation support) Automatically rotate images
             based on EXIF data.  Does not alter the image files.

             Note that Imlib2 version 1.7.5+ performs auto-rotation by itself,
             so this option is obsolete on systems with Imlib2 version 1.7.5
             or later.  feh currently cannot detect this at runtime.

     -Z, --auto-zoom
             Zoom pictures to screen size in fullscreen / fixed geometry mode.

     -x, --borderless
             Create borderless windows.

     --cache-size size
             Set imlib2 in-memory cache to size MiB.  A higher cache size can
             significantly improve performance especially for small slide
             shows, however at the cost of increased memory consumption.  size
             must be between 0 and 2048 MiB and defaults to 4.

     -P, --cache-thumbnails
             Enable thumbnail caching.  Thumbnails are saved in
             $XDG_CACHE_HOME/thumbnails, which defaults to
             ~/.cache/thumbnails.  Note that thumbnails are only cached if the
             configured thumbnail size does not exceed 256x256 pixels.

     -K, --caption-path path
             Path to directory containing image captions.  This turns on
             caption viewing, and if captions are found in path, which is
             relative to the directory of each image, they are overlayed on
             the displayed image.  E.g. with caption path "captions/", and
             viewing image "images/foo.jpg", the caption will be looked for in
             "images/captions/foo.jpg.txt".

     --conversion-timeout timeout
             feh can use ImageMagick to try converting unloadable files into a
             supported file format.  As this can take a long time, it is
             disabled by default.  Set timeout to a non-negative value to
             enable it.  A positive value specifies after how many seconds
             conversion attempts should be aborted, zero causes feh to try
             indefinitely.  Negative values restore the default by disabling
             conversion altogether.

     --class class
             Set the X11 class hint to class.  Default: feh

     -L, --customlist format
             Don't display images, print image info according to format
             instead.  See FORMAT SPECIFIERS.

     -G, --draw-actions
             Draw the defined actions and what they do at the top-left of the
             image.

     --draw-exif
             (optional feature, available in this build) display some EXIF
             information in the bottom left corner, similar to using --info
             with exiv2 / exifgrep.

     -d, --draw-filename
             Draw the file name at the top-left of the image.

     --draw-tinted
             Show overlay texts (as created by --draw-filename et al) on a
             semi-transparent background to improve their readability.

     --edit  Enable basic editing of files.  This makes rotation and mirroring
             (bound to "<", ">", "|", and "_" by default) change the
             underlying file and not just its displayed content.

     -f, --filelist file
             This option is similar to the playlists used by music software.
             If file exists, it will be read for a list of files to load, in
             the order they appear.  The format is a list of image file names,
             absolute or relative to the current directory, one file name per
             line.

             If file doesn't exist, it will be created from the internal
             filelist at the end of a viewing session.  This is best used to
             store the results of complex sorts (-Spixels for example) for
             later viewing.

             Any changes to the internal filelist (such as deleting a file or
             it being pruned for being unloadable) will be saved to file when
             feh exits.  You can add files to filelists by specifying them on
             the command line when also specifying the list.

             If file is "-", feh will read the filelist from its standard
             input.

     -e, --font font
             Set global font.  Should be a truetype font, resident in the
             current directory or the font directory, and should be defined in
             the form fontname/size, like "yudit/12" (which is the default).

     -C, --fontpath path
             Specify path as extra directory in which to search for fonts; can
             be used multiple times to add multiple paths.

     --force-aliasing
             Disable anti-aliasing for zooming, background setting etc.

     -I, --fullindex
             Same as index mode, but with additional information below the
             thumbnails.  Works just like "feh --index --index-info
             "%n\n%S\n%wx%h"".  Enables MONTAGE MODE OPTIONS.

             Note: This option needs to load all images to calculate the
             dimensions of the feh window, so when using it with many files it
             will take a while before a feh window is visible.  Use --preload
             to get a progress bar.

     -F, --fullscreen
             Make the window fullscreen.  Note that in this mode, large images
             will always be scaled down to fit the screen, and --zoom zoom
             only affects smaller images and never scales larger than
             necessary to fit the screen size.  The only exception is a zoom
             of 100, in which case images will always be shown at 100% zoom.

             When combined with --thumbnails, this option only affects images
             opened from the thumbnail overview.  The thumbnail list itself
             will still be windowed.

     -g, --geometry width x height | + x + y | width x height + x + y
             Use a fixed window size as specified in the X-style geometry
             string, e.g. 640x480.  An optional +x+y window offset can be
             specified.  Combine with --scale-down to scale down larger images
             like in fullscreen mode.  Note that this option does not enforce
             the window size; changing it by a tiling WM or manually is still
             possible.  However, auto-resize remains disabled.

     -Y, --hide-pointer
             Hide the pointer (useful for slideshows).

     -B, --image-bg style
             Use style as background for transparent image parts and the like.
             Accepted values: default, checks, or an XColor (e.g. "black" or
             "#428bdd").  Note that some shells treat the hash symbol as a
             special character, so you may need to quote or escape it for the
             XColor code to work.  In windowed mode, the default is checks (a
             checkered background so transparent image parts are easy to see).
             In fullscreen and background setting mode, checks is not accepted
             and the default is black.

     -i, --index
             Enable Index mode.  Index mode is similar to montage mode, and
             accepts the same options.  It creates an index print of
             thumbnails, printing the image name beneath each thumbnail.
             Index mode enables certain other options, see INDEX AND THUMBNAIL
             MODE OPTIONS and MONTAGE MODE OPTIONS.

     --info [flag]command_line
             Execute command_line and display its output in the bottom left
             corner of the image.  Can be used to display e.g. image
             dimensions or EXIF information.  Supports FORMAT SPECIFIERS.  If
             flag is set to ";", the output will not be displayed by default,
             but has to be enabled by the toggle_info key.

     --insecure
             When viewing files with HTTPS, this option disables all
             certificate checks.  It allows images on sites with self-signed
             or expired certificates to be opened, but is no more secure than
             plain HTTP.

     -k, --keep-http
             When viewing files using HTTP, feh normally deletes the local
             copies after viewing, or, if caching, on exit.  This option
             permanently stores them on disk, either in the directory
             specified by --output-dir, or in the current working directory.

     --keep-zoom-vp
             When switching images, keep zoom and viewport settings (zoom
             level and X, Y offsets)

     -l, --list
             Don't display images.  Analyze them and display an ls(1) - style
             listing.  Useful in scripts to hunt out images of a certain
             size/resolution/type etc.

     -U, --loadable
             Don't display images.  Just print out their names if imlib2 can
             successfully load them.  Returns false if at least one image
             failed to load.  When combined with --action, the specified
             action will be run for each loadable image.

     --max-dimension width x height
             Only show images with width <= width and height <= height.  If
             you only care about one parameter, set the other to 0 (or a
             negative value).

     -M, --menu-font font
             Use font (truetype, with size, like "yudit/12") as menu font.

     --min-dimension width x height
             Only show images with width >= width and height >= height.  If
             you only care about one parameter, set the other to 0.

     -m, --montage
             Enable montage mode.  Montage mode creates a new image consisting
             of a grid of thumbnails of the images in the filelist.  When
             montage mode is selected, certain other options become available.
             See MONTAGE MODE OPTIONS.

     -w, --multiwindow
             Disable slideshow mode.  With this setting, instead of opening
             multiple files in slideshow mode, multiple windows will be
             opened; one per file.

     --no-conversion-cache
             When loading images via HTTP, ImageMagick or dcraw, feh will only
             load/convert them once and re-use the cached file on subsequent
             slideshow passes.  This option disables the cache.  It is also
             disabled when --reload is used.  Use it if you rely on frequently
             changing files loaded via one of these sources.  Note that it
             will impair performance.

     --no-jump-on-resort
             Don't jump to the first image after resorting the filelist.

     -N, --no-menus
             Don't load or show any menus.

     --no-screen-clip
             By default, window sizes are limited to the screen size.  With
             this option, windows will have the size of the image inside them.
             Note that they may become very large this way, making them
             unmanageable in certain window managers.

     --no-xinerama
             (optional feature, enabled in this build) Disable Xinerama
             support.

     --on-last-slide hold | quit | resume
             Select behaviour when trying to select the next image on the last
             slide (or the previous image on the first slide) in a slide show.

             With hold, feh will stop advancing images in this case and
             continue displaying the first/last image, respectively.  This is
             intended for linear slide shows.  Behaviour is unspecified when
             using other navigation commands than previous and next image.

             quit will cause feh to quit when trying to advance past the last
             image in the slide show. This is the behavior of the obsolete
             --cycle-once option.

             resume is the default behaviour: On the last (first) image, feh
             will wrap around to the first (last) image.

     -j, --output-dir directory
             Save files to directory when using --keep-http or the save_image
             or save_filelist command.  By default, files are saved in the
             current working directory.

     -p, --preload
             Preload images.  This doesn't mean hold them in RAM, it means run
             through them and eliminate unloadable images first.  Otherwise
             they will be removed as you flick through.  This also analyses
             the images to get data for use in sorting, such as pixel size,
             type etc.  A preload run will be automatically performed if you
             specify one of these sort modes.

     -q, --quiet
             Don't report non-fatal errors for failed loads.  Verbose and
             quiet modes are not mutually exclusive, the first controls
             informational messages, the second only errors.

     -z, --randomize
             When viewing multiple files in a slideshow, randomize the file
             list before displaying.  The list is re-randomized whenever the
             slideshow cycles (that is, transitions from last to first image).

     -r, --recursive
             Recursively expand any directories in the command line arguments
             to the content of those directories, all the way down to the
             bottom level.

     --no-recursive
             Don't recursively expand any directories.  This is the default,
             but this option is useful to override themes containing
             --recursive.

     -R, --reload int
             Reload filelist and current image after int seconds.  Useful for
             viewing HTTP webcams or frequently changing directories.  (Note
             that filelist reloading is still experimental.) Set to zero to
             disable any kind of automatic reloading.

             If an image is removed, feh will either show the next one or
             quit.  However, if an image still exists, but can no longer be
             loaded, feh will continue to try loading it.

             Setting this option causes inotify-based auto-reload to be
             disabled.  Reload is not supported in montage, index, or
             thumbnail mode.

     -n, --reverse
             Reverse the sort order.  Use this to invert the order of the
             filelist.  E.g. to sort in reverse width order, use -nSwidth.

     -., --scale-down
             Scale images to fit window geometry (defaults to screen size when
             no geometry was specified).  Note that the window geometry is not
             updated when changing images at the moment.  This option is
             recommended for tiling window managers.  This option is ignored
             when in fullscreen and thumbnail list mode.

             In tiling environments, this also causes the image to be centered
             in the window.

     --scroll-step count
             Scroll count pixels whenever scroll_up, scroll_down, scroll_left
             or scroll_right is pressed.  Note that this option accepts
             negative numbers in case you need to reverse the scroll
             direction.  See KEYS CONFIG SYNTAX for how to reverse it
             permanently.  Default: 20

     -D, --slideshow-delay float
             For slideshow mode, wait float seconds between automatically
             changing slides.  Useful for presentations.  Specify a negative
             number to set the delay (which will then be float * (-1)), but
             start feh in paused mode.

     -S, --sort sort_type
             Sort file list according to image parameters.  Allowed sort types
             are: name, none, filename, dirname, mtime, width, height, pixels,
             size, format.  For sort modes other than name, none, filename,
             dirname, or mtime, a preload run is necessary, causing a delay
             proportional to the number of images in the list.

             mtime starts with the most recently modified image.  width,
             height, pixels and size start with the smallest.  Use --reverse
             to sort by oldest or largest first.

             For name, filename, and dirname you can use --version-sort to
             sort numbers naturally, so that e.g. 10.jpg comes after 2.jpg.

             none is the default; you can specify it explicitly to discard a
             sort mode that has been specified at an earlier point in the
             command line arguments.

     -|, --start-at filename
             Start the filelist at filename.  If no other files or filelists
             were specified on the command line, feh will first load all files
             from the directory in which filename resides.  This way, it's
             possible to look at a specific image and use the next / prev keys
             to browse through the directory.  See USAGE EXAMPLES for
             examples.  If filename is a remote URL and no files or filelists
             were specified, feh will show filename and not attempt to load
             additional files or directories.

             Note: If you use relative paths in your filelist, filename should
             also be a relative path.  If you use absolute paths, it should
             also be an absolute path.  If feh cannot find an exact match, it
             will compare basenames (filenames without the directory suffix).
             This may lead to mismatches if several files in your filelist
             have the same basename.

     -T, --theme theme
             Load options from config file with name theme - see THEMES CONFIG
             SYNTAX for more info.  Note that command line options always
             override theme options.  The theme can also be set via the
             program name (e.g. with symlinks), so by default feh will look
             for a "feh" theme.

     -t, --thumbnails
             Same as Index mode, but the thumbnails are clickable image
             launchers.  Note that --fullscreen and --scale-down do not affect
             the thumbnail window.  They do, however, work for image windows
             launched from thumbnail mode.  Also supports INDEX AND THUMBNAIL
             MODE OPTIONS as well as MONTAGE MODE OPTIONS.

     -~, --thumb-title string
             Set title for windows opened from thumbnail mode.  See also
             FORMAT SPECIFIERS.

     -^, --title title
             Set window title.  Applies to all windows except those opened
             from thumbnail mode.  See FORMAT SPECIFIERS.

     -u, --unloadable
             Don't display images.  Just print out their names if imlib2 can
             NOT successfully load them.  Returns false if at least one image
             was loadable.  When combined with --action, the specified action
             will be run for each unloadable file.

     -V, --verbose
             output useful information, progress bars, etc.

     -v, --version
             output version information and exit.

     --version-sort
             When combined with --sort name, --sort filename, or --sort
             dirname: use natural sorting for file and directory names.  In
             this mode, filenames are sorted as an ordinary human would
             expect, e.g.  "2.jpg" comes before "10.jpg".  Note that this
             option only has an effect when a sort mode is set using --sort.

     --window-id windowid
             Draw to an existing X11 window by its ID windowid.  This option
             is intended for use with software such as xcreensaver or
             xsecurelock, which provide a window for other applications to
             draw into.  Unexpected things will happen if you specify a window
             belonging to software which does not expect feh to draw into it
             or attempt to use options or keybindings which affect window
             attributes, such as full-screen mode.

     --xinerama-index monitor
             (optional feature, enabled in this build) Override feh's idea of
             the active Xinerama monitor.  May be useful in certain
             circumstances where the window manager places the feh window on
             Xinerama monitor A while feh assumes that it will be placed on
             monitor B.

             In background setting mode: When used with any option other than
             --bg-tile: Only set wallpaper on monitor.  All other monitors
             will be filled black/white.  This is most useful in a Xinerama
             configuration with overlapping monitors.  For instance, assume
             you have two overlapping displays (index 0 and 1), where index 0
             is smaller.  To center a background on the display with index 0
             and fill the extra space on index 1 black/white, use
             "--xinerama-index 0" when setting the wallpaper.

             Use xrandr --listmonitors to determine how Xinerama monitor IDs
             map to screens/monitors in your setup.

     --zoom percent | max | fill
             Zoom images by percent when in full screen mode or when window
             geometry is fixed.  When combined with --auto-zoom, zooming will
             be limited to the specified percent.  Specifying max is like
             setting --auto-zoom, using fill makes feh zoom the image like the
             --bg-fill mode.

     --zoom-step percent
             Zoom images in and out by percent (default: 25) when using the
             zoom keys and buttons.

MONTAGE MODE OPTIONS
     These additional options can be used for index, montage and (partially)
     thumbnail mode.

     -a, --alpha int
             When drawing thumbnails onto the background, set their
             transparency level to int (0 - 255).

     -b, --bg file | trans
             Use file as background for your montage.  With this option
             specified, the montage size will default to the size of file if
             no size restrictions were specified.  Alternatively, if file is
             "trans", the background will be made transparent.

     -X, --ignore-aspect
             By default, the montage thumbnails will retain their aspect
             ratios, while fitting into thumb-width/-height.  This options
             forces them to be the size set by --thumb-width and
             --thumb-height.  This will prevent any empty space in the final
             montage.

     -H, --limit-height pixels
             Limit the height of the montage.

     -W, --limit-width pixels
             Limit the width of the montage, defaults to 800 pixels.

             If both --limit-width and --limit-height are specified, the
             montage will be exactly width x height pixels in dimensions.

     -o, --output file
             Save the created montage to file.

     -O, --output-only file
             Just save the created montage to file without displaying it.

     -s, --stretch
             Normally, if an image is smaller than the specified thumbnail
             size, it will not be enlarged.  If this option is set, the image
             will be scaled up to fit the thumbnail size.  Aspect ratio will
             be maintained unless --ignore-aspect is specified.

     -E, --thumb-height pixels
             Set thumbnail height.

     -y, --thumb-width pixels
             Set thumbnail width.

INDEX AND THUMBNAIL MODE OPTIONS
     In addition to MONTAGE MODE OPTIONS --alpha, --bg, --limit-height,
     --limit-width, --output, --output-only, --thumb-height, --thumb-width,
     the following options can be used.

     --index-info format
             Show image information based on format below thumbnails in index
             / thumbnail mode.  See FORMAT SPECIFIERS.  May contain newlines.
             Use "--index-info ''" to display thumbnails without any info text

             Note: If you specify image-related formats (such as %w or %s),
             feh needs to load all images to calculate the dimensions of its
             own window.  So when using them with many files, it will take a
             while before a feh window becomes visible.  Use --preload to get
             a progress bar.

     -@, --title-font font
             Set font to print a title on the index, if no font is specified,
             no title will be printed.

     -J, --thumb-redraw n
             Redraw thumbnail window every n images while generating
             thumbnails.  Redrawing takes quite long, so the default is 10.
             Set n = 1 to update the thumbnail window immediately.  With n =
             0, there will only be one redraw once all thumbnails are loaded.

BACKGROUND SETTING
     In many desktop environments, feh can also be used as a background
     setter.  Unless you pass the --no-fehbg option, it will write a script to
     set the current background to ~/.fehbg.  So to have your background
     restored every time you start X, you can add "~/.fehbg &" to your X
     startup script (such as ~/.xinitrc).  Note that the commandline written
     to ~/.fehbg always includes the --no-fehbg option to ensure that it is
     not inadvertently changed by differences in X11 screen layout or similar.

     Note that feh does not support setting the wallpaper of GNOME shell
     desktops.  In this environment, you can use "gsettings set
     org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri file:///path" instead.

     For --bg-center, --bg-fill, and --bg-max, you can use --geometry to
     specify an offset from one side of the monitor instead of centering the
     image.  Positive values will offset from the left/top side, negative
     values from the bottom/right.  +0 and -0 are both valid and distinct
     values.

     Note that all options except --bg-tile support Xinerama.  For instance,
     if you have multiple monitors connected and use e.g.  --bg-center, feh
     will center or appropriately offset the image on each monitor.  You may
     even specify more than one file, in that case, the first file is set on
     monitor 0, the second on monitor 1, and so on.  Use xrandr --listmonitors
     to determine how Xinerama monitor IDs map to screens / monitors in your
     setup.

     Use --no-xinerama to treat the whole X display as one monitor when
     setting wallpapers.  You may also use --xinerama-index to use feh as a
     background setter for a specific monitor.

     --bg-center
             Center the file on the background.  If it is too small, it will
             be surrounded by a border as specified by --image-bg.

     --bg-fill
             Like --bg-scale, but preserves aspect ratio by zooming the image
             until it fits.  Either a horizontal or a vertical part of the
             image will be cut off

     --bg-max
             Like --bg-fill, but scale the image to the maximum size that fits
             the screen with borders on one side.  The border color can be set
             using --image-bg.

     --bg-scale
             Fit the file into the background without repeating it, cutting
             off stuff or using borders.  But the aspect ratio is not
             preserved either

     --bg-tile
             Tile (repeat) the image in case it is too small for the screen

     --no-fehbg
             Do not write a ~/.fehbg file

FORMAT SPECIFIERS

CONFIGURATION
     feh has three config files: themes for theme definitions, keys for key
     bindings and buttons for mouse button bindings.  It will try to read them
     from $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/feh/, which (when XDG_CONFIG_HOME is unset)
     defaults to ~/.config/feh/.  If the files are not found in that
     directory, it will also try /etc/feh/.

     All config files treat lines starting with a "#" character as comments.
     Comments at the end of a line are not supported.

THEMES CONFIG SYNTAX
     .config/feh/themes allows the naming of option groups, called themes.

     It takes entries of the form "theme options ...", where theme is the name
     of the entry and options are the options which will be applied when the
     theme is used.

     Note that the option parser does not behave like a normal shell: filename
     expansion and backslash escape sequences are not supported and passed to
     feh's option parser as-is.  However, quoting of arguments is respected
     and can be used for arguments with whitespace.  So, the sequence "--info
     "foo bar"" works as intended (that is, it display the string "foo bar"),
     whereas the option string "--info foo\ bar" will only display "foo\" and
     complain about the file bar not existing.  Please keep this in mind when
     writing theme files.

     An example entry is "imagemap -rVq --thumb-width 40 --thumb-height 30
     --index-info '%n\n%wx%h'".

     You can use this theme in two ways.  Either call "feh -Timagemap *.jpg",
     or create a symbolic link to feh with the name of the theme you want it
     to use.  For the example above, this would be "ln -s `which feh `
     ~/bin/imagemap".  Now just run "imagemap *.jpg" to use these options.

     Note that you can split a theme over several lines by placing a backslash
     at the end of an unfinished line.  A single option-argument-pair must not
     span multiple lines.  A single line must not be longer than 1023
     characters, but there's no upper limit for the length of a theme.

     Command line options always override theme options.

KEYS CONFIG SYNTAX
     .config/feh/keys defines key bindings.  It has entries of the form
     "action [key1 [key2 [key3]]]".

     Each key is an X11 keysym name as shown by xev(1), like "Delete".  It may
     optionally start with modifiers for things like Control, in which case
     key looks like mod-keysym (for example "C-Delete" for Ctrl+Delete or
     "C-1-Delete" for Ctrl+Alt+Delete)

     Available modifiers are C for Control, S for Shift and 1, 4 for Mod1 and
     Mod4.  To match an uppercase letter like "S" instead of "s", the Shift
     modifier is not required.

     Specifying an action without any keys unbinds it (i.e. the default
     bindings are removed).

     Note: Do not use the same keybinding for multiple actions.  When binding
     an action to a new key (or mouse button), make sure to unbind it from its
     previous action, if present.  feh does not check for conflicting
     bindings, so their behaviour is undefined.

     For a list of the action names, see KEYS.  Note that not all of the key
     names used there correspond to X11 keysyms.  Most notably, page up (Prior
     / Page_Up), page down (Next / Page_Down) and the keypad keys (KP_*) do
     not.

KEYS
     The following actions and default key bindings can be used in an image
     window.  (The strings in [square brackets] are the config action names).
     If feh is running inside a terminal and its standard input is not used
     for images or filelists, key input from the terminal is also accepted.
     However, terminal input support is currently limited to most alphanumeric
     characters (0-9 a-z A-Z and some more), arrow keys, return and backspace.
     The Alt (Mod1) modifier is also supported.

     a [toggle_actions]
             Toggle actions display (see --draw-actions)

     A [toggle_aliasing]
             Enable/Disable anti-aliasing

     c [toggle_caption]
             Caption entry mode.  If --caption-path has been specified, then
             this enables caption editing.  The caption at the bottom of the
             screen will turn yellow and can be edited.  Hit return to confirm
             and save the caption, or escape to cancel editing.  Note that you
             can insert an actual newline into the caption using
             ⟨Ctrl+return⟩.

     d [toggle_filenames]
             Toggle filename display (see --draw-filename)

     e [toggle_exif]
             (optional feature, available in this build) Toggle EXIF tag
             display

     f [toggle_fullscreen]
             Toggle fullscreen

     g [toggle_fixed_geometry]
             Enable/Disable automatic window resize when changing images.

     h [toggle_pause]
             Pause/Continue the slideshow.  When it is paused, it will not
             automatically change slides based on --slideshow-delay.

     i [toggle_info]
             Toggle info display (see --info)

     k [toggle_keep_vp]
             Toggle zoom and viewport keeping.  When enabled, feh will keep
             zoom and X, Y offset when switching images.

     L [save_filelist]
             Save the current filelist as "feh_PID_ID_filelist".  It is saved
             in the directory specified by --output-dir, if set, and in the
             current working directory otherwise.

     m [toggle_menu]
             Show menu.  Use the arrow keys and return to select items, and
             ⟨escape⟩ to close the menu.

     n, ⟨space⟩, ⟨Right⟩ [next_img]
             Show next image.  Selects the next image in thumbnail mode.

     o [toggle_pointer]
             Toggle pointer visibility

     p, ⟨BackSpace⟩, ⟨Left⟩ [prev_img]
             Show previous image.  Selects the previous image in thumbnail
             mode.

     q, ⟨Escape⟩ [quit]
             Quit feh

     r [reload_image]
             Reload current image.  Useful for webcams

     s [save_image]
             Save the current image as "feh_PID_ID_FILENAME".  It is saved in
             the directory specified by --output-dir, if set, and in the
             current working directory otherwise.

     w [size_to_image]
             Change window size to fit current image size (plus/minus zoom, if
             set).  In scale-down and fixed-geometry mode, this also updates
             the window size limits.

     x [close]
             Close current window

     z [jump_random]
             Jump to a random position in the current filelist

     Z [toggle_auto_zoom]
             Toggle auto-zoom.

     [, ] [prev_dir, next_dir]
             Jump to the first image of the previous or next sequence of
             images sharing a directory name in the current filelist.  Use
             --sort dirname if you would like to ensure that all images in a
             directory are grouped together.

     <, > [orient_3, orient_1]
             rotate the image 90 degrees (counter)clockwise.

             When --edit is used, this also rotates the image in the
             underlying file.  Rotation is lossless, but may create artifacts
             in some image corners when used with JPEG images.  Rotating in
             the reverse direction will make them go away.  See jpegtran(1)
             for more about lossless JPEG rotation.  Note: feh assumes that
             this feature is used to normalize image orientation.  For JPEG
             images, it will unconditionally set the EXIF orientation tag to 1
             ("0,0 is top left") after every rotation.  See jpegexiforient(1)
             for details on how to change this flag.

     _ [flip]
             Vertically flip image.  When --edit is used, this also flips the
             image in the underlying file (see above).

     | [mirror]
             Horizontally flip image.  When --edit is used, this also flips
             the image in the underlying file (see above).

     0 .. 9 [action_0 .. action_9]

     ⟨Return⟩, ⟨space⟩ [menu_select]
             Select highlighted menu item

BUTTONS CONFIG SYNTAX
     .config/feh/buttons.  This works like the keys config file: the entries
     are of the form "action [binding]".

     Each binding is a button number.  It may optionally start with modifiers
     for things like Control, in which case binding looks like mod-button (for
     example C-1 for Ctrl + Left button).

     Note: Do not use the same button for multiple actions.  feh does not
     check for conflicting bindings, so their behaviour is undefined.  Either
     unbind the unwanted action, or bind it to another unused button.  The
     order in which you bind / unbind does not matter, though.

     For the available modifiers, see KEYS CONFIGURATION SYNTAX.

   BUTTONS
     In an image window, the following buttons may be used (The strings in
     [square brackets] are the config action names).  Additionally, all
     actions specified in the KEYS section can also be bound to a button.

     unbound [reload]
             Reload current image

     0 ⟨cursor movement while not panning, zooming, or similar⟩
             Does not have a default binding.  By binding it to quit, you can
             turn feh into a simple screensaver.

     1 ⟨left mouse button⟩ [pan]
             pan the current image

     2 ⟨middle mouse button⟩ [zoom]
             Zoom the current image

     3 ⟨right mouse button⟩ [toggle_menu]
             Toggle menu

     4 ⟨mousewheel down⟩ [prev_img]
             Show previous image

     5 ⟨mousewheel up⟩ [next_img]
             Show next image

     Ctrl+1 [blur]
             Blur current image

     Ctrl+2 [rotate]
             Rotate current image

     unbound [zoom_in]
             Zoom in

     unbound [zoom_out]
             Zoom out

MOUSE ACTIONS
     Default Bindings: When viewing an image, mouse button 1 pans the image
     (moves it around) or, when only clicked, moves to the next image
     (slideshow mode only).  Quick drags with less than 2px of movement per
     axis will be treated as clicks to aid graphics tablet users.  Mouse
     button 2 zooms (click and drag left->right to zoom in, right->left to
     zoom out, click once to restore zoom to 100%) and mouse button 3 opens
     the menu.

     Ctrl+Button 1 blurs or sharpens the image (drag left to blur, right to
     sharpen); Ctrl+Button 2 rotates the image around the center point.

     A note about pan and zoom modes: In pan mode, if you reach a window
     border but haven't yet panned to the end of the image, feh will warp your
     cursor to the opposite border so you can continue panning.

     When clicking the zoom button and immediately releasing it, the image
     will be back at 100% zoom.  When clicking it and moving the mouse while
     holding the button down, the zoom will be continued at the previous zoom
     level.  The zoom will always happen so that the pixel on which you
     entered the zoom mode remains stationary.  So, to enlarge a specific part
     of an image, click the zoom button on that part.

SIGNALS
     In slideshow and multiwindow mode, feh handles the following signals:

     SIGUSR1
             Slideshow mode: switch to next image; reload current image if the
             slideshow consists of a single file.  Multiwindow mode: reload
             all images.

     SIGUSR2
             Slideshow mode: switch to previous image; reload current image if
             the slideshow consists of a single file.  Multiwindow mode:
             reload all images.

USAGE EXAMPLES
     Here are some examples of useful option combinations.  See also:
     ⟨https://feh.finalrewind.org/examples/⟩

     feh ~/Pictures
             Show all images in ~/Pictures

     feh -r ~/Pictures
             Recursively show all images found in ~/Pictures and
             subdirectories

     feh -rSfilename --version-sort ~/Pictures
             Same as above, but sort naturally.  By default, feh will show
             files in the string order of their names, meaning e.g.  "foo
             10.jpg" will come before "foo 2.jpg".  In this case, they are
             instead ordered as a human would expect.

     feh -t -Sfilename -E 128 -y 128 -W 1024 ~/Pictures
             Show 128x128 pixel thumbnails, limit window width to 1024 pixels.

     feh -t -Sfilename -E 128 -y 128 -W 1024 -P -C
             /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-dejavu/ -e DejaVuSans/8 ~/Pictures
             Same as above, but enable thumbnail caching and use a smaller
             font.

     feh -irFarial/14 -O index.jpg ~/Pictures
             Make an index print of ~/Pictures and all directories below it,
             using 14 point Arial to write the image info under each
             thumbnail.  Save the image as index.jpg and don't display it,
             just exit.  Note that this even works without a running X server

     feh --unloadable -r ~/Pictures
             Print all unloadable images in ~/Pictures, recursively

     feh -f by_width -S width --reverse --list .
             Write a list of all images in the directory to by_width, sorted
             by width (widest images first)

     feh -w ~/Pictures/holidays
             Open each image in ~/Pictures/holidays in its own window

     feh -FD5 -Sname ~/Pictures/presentation
             Show the images in .../presentation, sorted by name, in
             fullscreen, automatically change to the next image after 5
             seconds

     feh -rSwidth -A "mv %F ~/images/%N" ~/Pictures
             View all images in ~/Pictures and below, sorted by width, move an
             image to ~/image/image_name when enter is pressed

     feh --start-at ~/Pictures/foo.jpg
             View all images in ~/Pictures, starting with foo.jpg.  All other
             images are still in the slideshow and can be viewed normally

     feh --start-at ~/Pictures/foo.jpg ~/Pictures
             Same as above.

     feh --info "exifgrep '(Model|DateTimeOriginal|FNumber|ISO|Flash)' %F |
             cut -d . -f 4-" .
             Show some EXIF information, extracted by exifprobe/exifgrep

     feh --action 'rm %F' -rl --max-dimension 1000x800
             Recursively remove all images with dimensions below or equal to
             1000x800 pixels from the current directory.

     feh -L '%w %h %f' | awk '{ if ($1 > $2) { print $0 } }' | cut -d ' ' -f
             3- | feh -f -
             Show landscape pictures (image width greater than height) in the
             current directory.

DEPENDENCIES
     When --edit is used, feh needs the jpegtran and jpegexiforient binaries
     (usually distributed in "libjpeg-progs" or similar) for lossless JPEG
     rotation.

     To view images from URLs such as "http://", feh must be compiled with
     libcurl support.  It is enabled in this build

KNOWN BUGS
     Imlib2 releases prior to 1.7.4 are unable to load gif, tiff, and webp
     images if the filename does not end with gif, tiff, or webp,
     respectively.  Notably, this means that feh is unable to show gif, tiff,
     and webp images from stdin or network URLs on systems using an Imlib2
     version older than 1.7.4.

     Imlib2 releases 1.7.5+ automatically rotate images based on their EXIF
     tags.  When combined with the --auto-rotate option, this causes images to
     be rotated twice and end up in an incorrect orientation.  As a
     workaround, do not use --auto-rotate on systems with Imlib2 version 1.7.5
     or later.

     On systems with giflib 5.1.2, feh may be unable to load gif images.  For
     affected mips, mipsel and arm devices, gif support is completely broken,
     while on x86 / x86_64 gifs can usually only be loaded if they are the
     first image in the filelist.  This appears to be a bug in giflib, see
     ⟨https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=813729⟩ for details.
     Workaround: Use --conversion-timeout 5 (or some other positive value) to
     load gifs with imagemagick instead, or downgrade to giflib 5.1.1, or
     upgrade to giflib 5.1.4.

     While loading images using libcurl, feh will not react to key or mouse
     actions.

     Thumbnail mode is somewhat inefficient, and because of that not nearly as
     fast as it could be.

     --scale-down does not take window decorations into account and may
     therefore make the window slightly too large.

   REPORTING BUGS
     If you find a bug, please report it to ⟨derf+feh@finalrewind.org⟩ or via
     ⟨https://github.com/derf/feh/issues⟩.

     Please include the feh version ⟨the output of "feh --version"⟩, steps to
     reproduce the bug and, if necessary, images to reproduce it.  Note that
     feh is a hobby project, so bug reports may be addressed with significant
     delays.
