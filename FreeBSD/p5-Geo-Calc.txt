DESCRIPTION
       "Geo::Calc" implements a variety of calculations for latitude/longitude
       points

       All these formulare are for calculations on the basis of a spherical
       earth (ignoring ellipsoidal effects) which is accurate enough* for most
       purposes.

       [ In fact, the earth is very slightly ellipsoidal; using a spherical
       model gives errors typically up to 0.3% ].

Geo::Calc->new()
        $gc = Geo::Calc->new( lat => 40.417875, lon => -3.710205 ); # Somewhere in Madrid
        $gc = Geo::Calc->new( lat => 51.503269, lon => 0, units => 'k-m' ); # The O2 Arena in London

       Creates a new Geo::Calc object from a latitude and longitude. The
       default deciaml precision is -6 for all functions => meaning by default
       it always returns the results with 6 deciamls.

       The default unit distance is 'm' (meter), but you cand define another
       unit using 'units'.  Accepted values are: 'm' (meters), 'k-m'
       (kilometers), 'yd' (yards), 'ft' (feet) and 'mi' (miles)

       Returns ref to a Geo::Calc object.

   Parameters
       lat ""=> latitude of the point ( required )

       lon ""=> longitude of the point ( required )

       radius
           ""=> earth radius in km ( defaults to 6371 )

METHODS
   distance_to
        $gc->distance_to( $point[, $precision] )
        $gc->distance_to( { lat => 40.422371, lon => -3.704298 } )

       This uses the "haversine" formula to calculate great-circle distances
       between the two points - that is, the shortest distance over the
       earth's surface - giving an `as-the-crow-flies` distance between the
       points (ignoring any hills!)

       The haversine formula `remains particularly well-conditioned for
       numerical computation even at small distances` - unlike calculations
       based on the spherical law of cosines. It was published by R W Sinnott
       in Sky and Telescope, 1984, though known about for much longer by
       navigators. (For the curious, c is the angular distance in radians, and
       a is the square of half the chord length between the points).

       Returns with the distance using the precision defined or -6 ( -6 = 6
       decimals ( eg 4.000001 ) )

   bearing_to
        $gc->bearing_to( $point[, $precision] );
        $gc->bearing_to( { lat => 40.422371, lon => -3.704298 }, -6 );

       In general, your current heading will vary as you follow a great circle
       path (orthodrome); the final heading will differ from the initial
       heading by varying degrees according to distance and latitude (if you
       were to go from say 35N,45E (Baghdad) to 35N,135E (Osaka), you would
       start on a heading of 60 and end up on a heading of 120!).

       This formula is for the initial bearing (sometimes referred to as
       forward azimuth) which if followed in a straight line along a great-
       circle arc will take you from the start point to the end point

       Returns the (initial) bearing from this point to the supplied point, in
       degrees with the specified pricision

       see http://williams.best.vwh.net/avform.htm#Crs

   final_bearing_to
        my $f_brng = $gc->final_bearing_to( $point[, $precision] );
        my $f_brng = $gc->final_bearing_to( { lat => 40.422371, lon => -3.704298 } );

       Returns final bearing arriving at supplied destination point from this
       point; the final bearing will differ from the initial bearing by
       varying degrees according to distance and latitude

   midpoint_to
        $gc->midpoint_to( $point[, $precision] );
        $gc->midpoint_to( { lat => 40.422371, lon => -3.704298 } );

       Returns the midpoint along a great circle path between the initial
       point and the supplied point.

       see http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/51822.html for derivation

   destination_point
        $gc->destination_point( $bearing, $distance[, $precision] );
        $gc->destination_point( 90, 1 );

       Returns the destination point and the final bearing using Vincenty
       inverse formula for ellipsoids.

   destination_point_hs
        $gc->destination_point_hs( $bearing, $distance[, $precision] );
        $gc->destination_point_hs( 90, 1 );

       Returns the destination point from this point having travelled the
       given distance on the given initial bearing (bearing may vary before
       destination is reached)

       see http://williams.best.vwh.net/avform.htm#LL

   boundry_box
        $gc->boundry_box( $width[, $height[, $precision]] ); # in km
        $gc->boundry_box( 3, 4 ); # will generate a 3x4m box around the point
        $gc->boundry_box( 1 ); # will generate a 2x2m box around the point (radius)

       Returns the boundry box min/max having the initial point defined as the
       center of the boundry box, given the widht and height

   rhumb_distance_to
        $gc->rhumb_distance_to( $point[, $precision] );
        $gc->rhumb_distance_to( { lat => 40.422371, lon => -3.704298 } );

       Returns the distance from this point to the supplied point, in km,
       travelling along a rhumb line.

       A 'rhumb line' (or loxodrome) is a path of constant bearing, which
       crosses all meridians at the same angle.

       Sailors used to (and sometimes still) navigate along rhumb lines since
       it is easier to follow a constant compass bearing than to be
       continually adjusting the bearing, as is needed to follow a great
       circle. Rhumb lines are straight lines on a Mercator Projection map
       (also helpful for navigation).

       Rhumb lines are generally longer than great-circle (orthodrome) routes.
       For instance, London to New York is 4% longer along a rhumb line than
       along a great circle . important for aviation fuel, but not
       particularly to sailing vessels. New York to Beijing . close to the
       most extreme example possible (though not sailable!) . is 30% longer
       along a rhumb line.

       see http://williams.best.vwh.net/avform.htm#Rhumb

   rhumb_bearing_to
        $gc->rhumb_bearing_to( $point[, $precision] );
        $gc->rhumb_bearing_to( { lat => 40.422371, lon => -3.704298 } );

       Returns the bearing from this point to the supplied point along a rhumb
       line, in degrees

   rhumb_destination_point
        $gc->rhumb_destination_point( $brng, $distance[, $precision] );
        $gc->rhumb_destination_point( 30, 1 );

       Returns the destination point from this point having travelled the
       given distance (in km) on the given bearing along a rhumb line.

   intersection
        $gc->intersection( $brng1, $point, $brng2[, $precision] );
        $gc->intersection( 90, { lat => 40.422371, lon => -3.704298 }, 180 );

       Returns the point of intersection of two paths defined by point and
       bearing

       see http://williams.best.vwh.net/avform.htm#Intersection

   distance_at
       Returns the distance in meters for 1deg of latitude and longitude at
       the specified latitude

        my $m_distance = $self->distance_at([$precision]);
        my $m_distance = $self->distance_at();
        # at lat 2 with precision -6 returns { m_lat => 110575.625009, m_lon => 111252.098718 }
