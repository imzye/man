NAME
       epm - create software packages.

SYNOPSIS
       epm [ -a architecture ] [ -f format ] [ -g ] [ -k ] [ -m name ] [
       -n[mrs] ] [ -s setup.ext ] [ --depend ] [ --help ] [ --keep-files ] [
       --output-dir directory ] [ --setup-image setup.ext ] [ --setup-program
       /foo/bar/setup ] [ --setup-types setup.types ] [ --uninstall-program
       /foo/bar/uninst ] [ -v ] [ name=value name=value ] product [ listfile ]

DESCRIPTION
       epm(1) generates software packages complete with installation, removal,
       and (if necessary) patch scripts.  Unless otherwise specified, the
       files required for product are read from a file named "product.list".

OPTIONS
       The following options are recognized:

       -a architecture
            Specifies the actual architecture for the software.  Without this
            option the generic processor architecture is used ("intel",
            "sparc", "mips", etc.)

       -f bsd
            Generate a BSD distribution suitable for installation on a
            FreeBSD, NetBSD, or OpenBSD system.

       -f deb
            Generate a Debian distribution suitable for installation on a
            Debian-based Linux system.

       -f native
            Generate a native distribution.  This uses deb or rpm for Linux,
            bsd for FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD, and macos for macOS.  All
            other operating systems default to the portable format.

       -f macos

       -f macos-signed
            Generate a macOS software package.  The macos-signed format uses
            the signing identity in the EPM_SIGNING_IDENTITY environment
            variable.

       -f portable
            Generate a portable distribution based on shell scripts and tar
            files.  The resulting distribution is installed and removed the
            same way on all operating systems. [default]

       -f rpm

       -f rpm-signed
            Generate a Red Hat Package Manager ("RPM") distribution suitable
            for installation on an RPM-based Linux system.  The rpm-signed
            format uses the GPG private key you have defined in the
            ~/.rpmmacros file.

       -g   Disable stripping of executable files in the distribution.

       -k   Keep intermediate (spec, etc.) files used to create the
            distribution in the distribution directory.

       -m name
            Specifies the platform name as a string.  The default is to use
            the auto-generated name from the -n option.

       -n[mrs]
            Specifies the operating system and machine information that is
            included in the package name.  Distributions normally are named
            "product-version-system-release-machine.ext" and "product-version-
            system-release-machine-patch.ext" for patch distributions.  The
            "system-release-machine" information can be customized or
            eliminated using the appropriate trailing letters.  Using -n by
            itself will remove the "system-release-machine" string from the
            filename entirely.  The letter 'm' includes the architecture
            (machine).  The letter 'r' includes the operating system version
            (release).  The letter 's' includes the operating system name.

       -v   Increases the amount of information that is reported.  Use
            multiple v's for more verbose output.

       --depend
            Lists the dependent (source) files for all files in the package.

       --output-dir directory
            Specifies the directory for output files.  The default directory
            is based on the operating system, version, and architecture.

       -s setup.ext

       --setup-image setup.ext
            Include the ESP Software Wizard with the specified image file with
            the distribution.  This option is currently only supported by
            portable distributions.

       --setup-program /foo/bar/setup
            Specifies the setup executable to use with the distribution.  This
            option is currently only supported by portable distributions.

       --setup-types setup.types

       Specifies the setup.types file to include with the distribution.  This
       option is currently only supported by portable distributions.

       --uninstall-program /foo/bar/uninst
            Specifies the uninst executable to use with the distribution.
            This option is currently only supported by portable distributions.

ENVIRONMENT
       The following environment variables are supported by epm:

       EPM_SIGNING_IDENTITY
            The common name that should be used when signing a package.

LIST FILES
       The EPM list file format is now described in the epm.list(5) man page.
