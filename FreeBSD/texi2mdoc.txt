TEXI2MDOC(1)            FreeBSD General Commands Manual           TEXI2MDOC(1)

NAME
     texi2mdoc – convert texinfo documents to mdoc

SYNOPSIS
     texi2mdoc [-I dirs] [file]

DESCRIPTION
     The texi2mdoc utility converts GNU Texinfo documents to mdoc(7) mixed
     with tbl(7) (if applicable).  By default, texi2mdoc reads from standard
     input.  Its arguments are as follows:

     -I dirs
             Colon-separated directories to search for @include files.

     file    A Texinfo input file.  If specified, the directory of file is
             prepended to the list of -I directories.

     texi2mdoc can understand a significant subset of the texinfo language.
     It recognises itself as a plaintext formatter.  The produced document's
     title is set to the file filename and the description is set to the
     @settitle command's contents.

EXIT STATUS
     The texi2mdoc utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

SEE ALSO

AUTHORS
     The texi2mdoc utility was written by Kristaps Dzonsons <kristaps@bsd.lv>.

CAVEATS
     The output consists of superfluous ‘Pp’ that cause
           % mandoc -Tlint
     to complain.

     Many commands that might contain useful information (such as @footnote)
     are thrown away.

     The comma in Texinfo macro arguments may at times be escaped with a
     backslash.  This is not supported.

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
     As a security precaution, texi2mdoc does not allow the inclusion (via
     @include or @verbatiminclude) of absolute paths or paths with .. as
     directory components.
