Tree::Simple::View(3)                      User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Tree::Simple::View - A set of classes for viewing Tree::Simple
       hierarchies

SYNOPSIS
         # create a custom Tree View class
         package MyCustomTreeView;

         use strict;
         use warnings;

         # inherit from this class
         our @ISA = qw(Tree::Simple::View);

         # define (at a minimum) these methods
         sub expandPathSimple { ... }
         sub expandPathComplex { ... }

         sub expandAllSimple { ... }
         sub expandAllComplex { ... }

         1;

DESCRIPTION
       This serves as an abstract base class to the Tree::Simple::View::*
       classes. There are two implementing classes included here;
       Tree::Simple::View::HTML and Tree::Simple::View::DHTML.  Other
       Tree::Simple::View::* classes are also being planned, see the "TO DO"
       section for more information.

       These modules should be considered stable and ready for production use.
       We have been using this module in production on a number of sites for
       several years now without issue.

METHODS
       new ($tree, %configuration)
           Accepts a $tree argument of a Tree::Simple object (or one derived
           from Tree::Simple), if $tree is not a Tree::Simple object, and
           exception is thrown. This $tree object does not need to be a ROOT,
           you can start at any level of the tree you desire. The options in
           the %config argument are determined by the implementing subclass,
           and you should refer to that documentation for details.

       getTree
           A basic accessor to reach the underlying tree object.

       getConfig
           A basic accessor to reach the underlying configuration hash.

       includeTrunk ($boolean)
           This controls the getting and setting (through the optional
           $boolean argument) of the option to include the tree's trunk in the
           output. Many times, the trunk is not actually part of the tree, but
           simply a root from which all the branches spring. However, on
           occasion, it might be necessary to view a sub-tree, in which case,
           the trunk is likely intended to be part of the output. This option
           defaults to off.

       setPathComparisonFunction ($CODE)
           This takes a $CODE reference, which can be used to add custom path
           comparison features to Tree::Simple::View. The function will get
           two arguments, the first is the $current_path, the second is the
           $current_tree. When using "expandPath", it may sometimes be
           nessecary to be able to control the comparison of the path values.
           For instance, your node may be an object and need a specific method
           called to match the path against.

       expandPath (@path)
           This method will return a string which will represent your tree
           expanded along the given @path. This is best shown visually. Given
           this tree:

             Tree-Simple-View
                 lib
                     Tree
                         Simple
                             View.pm
                             View
                                 HTML.pm
                                 DHTML.pm
                 Makefile.PL
                 MANIFEST
                 README
                 Changes
                 t
                     10_Tree_Simple_View_test.t
                     20_Tree_Simple_View_HTML_test.t
                     30_Tree_Simple_View_DHTML_test.t

           And given this path:

             Tree-Simple-View, lib, Tree, Simple

           Your display would like something like this:

             Tree-Simple-View
                 lib
                     Tree
                         Simple
                             View.pm
                             View
                 Makefile.PL
                 MANIFEST
                 README
                 Changes
                 t

           As you can see, the given path has been expanded, but no other sub-
           trees are shown. The details of this are subject to the
           implementating subclass, and their documentation should be
           consulted.

           It should be noted that this method actually calls either the
           "expandPathSimple" or "expandPathComplex" method depending upon the
           %config argument in the constructor.

       expandPathSimple ($tree, @path)
           Within this base package, this is an abstract method, it will throw
           an exception if called.

           If no %config argument is given in the constructor, then this
           method is called by "expandPath". This method is optimized since it
           does not need to process any configuration, but just as the name
           implies, it's output is simple.

           This method can also be used for another purpose, which is to
           bypass a previously specified configuration and use the base
           "simple" configuration instead.

       expandPathComplex ($tree, $config, @path)
           Within this base package, this is an abstract method, it will throw
           an exception if called.

           If a %config argument is given in the constructor, then this method
           is called by "expandPath". This method has been optimized to be
           used with configurations, and will actually custom compile code
           (using "eval") to speed up the generation of the output.

           This method can also be used for another purpose, which is to
           bypass a previously specified configuration and use the
           configuration specified (as a HASH reference) in the $config
           parameter.

       expandAll
           This method will return a string of HTML which will represent your
           tree completely expanded. The details of this are subject to the
           implementating subclass, and their documentation should be
           consulted.

           It should be noted that this method actually calls either the
           "expandAllSimple" or "expandAllComplex" method depending upon the
           %config argument in the constructor.

       expandAllSimple
           Within this base package, this is an abstract method, it will throw
           an exception if called.

           If no %config argument is given in the constructor, then this
           method is called by "expandAll". This method too is optimized since
           it does not need to process any configuration.

           This method as well can also be used to bypass a previously
           specified configuration and use the base "simple" configuration
           instead.

       expandAllComplex ($config)
           Within this base package, this is an abstract method, it will throw
           an exception if called.

           If a %config argument is given in the constructor, then this method
           is called by "expandAll". This method too has been optimized to be
           used with configurations, and will also custom compile code (using
           "eval") to speed up the generation of the output.

           Just as with "expandPathComplex", this method can be to bypass a
           previously specified configuration and use the configuration
           specified (as a HASH reference) in the $config parameter.

BUGS
       None that I am aware of. Of course, if you find a bug, let me know, and
       I will be sure to fix it.

SEE ALSO
       This is just an abstract base class, I suggest you read the
       documentation in the implementing subclasses:

       Tree::Simple::View::HTML
       Tree::Simple::View::DHTML

       There are a few modules out there that I have seen which do similar
       things to these modules.  I have attempted to describe them here, but
       not being a user of these modules myself, I can not do them justice. If
       you think I have mis-represented or just under-represented these
       modules, please let me know. Also, if I have not included a module
       which should be here, let me know and I will add it.

       Data::TreeDumper
           This module is an alternative to Data::Dumper for dumping out any
           type of data structures.  As the author points out, the output of
           Data::Dumper when dealing with tree structures can be difficult to
           read at best. This module solves that problem by dumping a much
           more readable and understandable output specially for tree
           structures. Data::TreeDumper has many options for output, including
           custom filters and coloring. I have been working with this module's
           author and we have been sharing code. Data::TreeDumper can output
           Tree::Simple objects
           (<http://search.cpan.org/~nkh/Data-TreeDumper-0.15/TreeDumper.pm#Structure_replacement>).
           This gives Tree::Simple the ability to utilize the ASCII/ANSI
           output  styles of Data::TreeDumper.  Nadim has used some of the
           code from  Tree::Simple::View to add DHTML output to
           Data::TreeDumper.  The DHTML output can be without tree-lines as
           for Tree::Simple::View or with tree-lines as with Data::TreeDumper.

       Data::RenderAsTree
           Abstract: Render any data structure as an object of type
           Tree::DAG_Node.

           Similar to Data::TreeDumper

       HTML::PopupTreeSelect
           This module implements a DHTML "pop-up" dialog which contains an
           expand-collapse tree, which can be used for selecting an item from
           a hierarchy. It looks to me to be very configurable and have all
           its bases covered, right down to handling some of the uglies of
           cross-browser/cross-platform DHTML. However it is really for a very
           specific purpose, and not for general tree display like this
           module.

       HTML::TreeStructured
           This module actually seems to do something very similar to these
           modules, but to be honest, the documentation is very, very sparse,
           and so I am not really sure how to go about using it.  From a quick
           read of the code it seems to use HTML::Template as its base, but
           after that I am not sure.
