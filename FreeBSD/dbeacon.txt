NAME
       dbeacon - Distributed IPv4/IPv6 multicast beacon

SYNOPSYS
       dbeacon -a MAIL -b BEACON_ADDR[/PORT] [-i INTFNAME] [-n NAME] [-S
       [GROUP_ADDR[/PORT]] [-s ADDR] [-d [FILE]] [-I NUMBER] [-W type$url] [-L
       program] [-C CC] [-4] [-6] [-v] [-P] [-U] [-V] [-F flag] [-O] [-B ADDR]

DESCRIPTION
       dbeacon is a network level management tool aiming at getting various
       statistics about multicast connectivity. Its first usage is to check
       out if you can send/receive toward/from an IPv4/IPv6 multicast network.
       Its second usage is to gather various statistics by using a known
       multicast ASM group, for example TTL between each multicast peers, loss
       or jitter figures. Theses statistics are kept internally but can be
       dumped periodically in a file in xml format for latter processing.
       Statistics gathering is completetly distributed and rely on the
       powerful nature of ASM. No server is required, but maybe a http server
       for accessing the statistics and build an adjacency matrix of the
       peers.

OPTIONS
       -n NAME, -name NAME
              The name identifying you on the dbeacon session. If not
              specified, dbeacon will use the hostname of the running machine.

       -a MAIL
              Administrative contact. This is an e-mail used for join you, for
              example to notify you that something is wrong is your multicast
              connectivity

       -i IN, -interface IN
              Use IN instead of the default interface for multicast.

       -b BEACON_ADDR/PORT
              This is the IPv4/IPv6 address of the ASM group used by dbeacon
              to gather statistics. It can be specified as a DNS name too.

       -S GROUP_ADDR/PORT
              Enables SSM reception/sending on optional GROUP_ADDR/PORT

       -O     This option enable SSM data sending in addition to ASM data. It
              can be used to check if people can reach you via SSM.

       -B ADDR
              This allows you to bootstrap from an ADDR that is already in the
              matrix. This option is useful when you ASM connectivity is
              broken but SSM connectivity works.

       -P, -ssmping
              Enable SSM Ping server capability.

       -s ADDR
              Bind to local address. This allow you to specify the multicast
              source of the packets sent by your beacon.

       -d FILE
              Dump periodic reports to dump.xml or specified file. This file
              may be latter processed by any XML compliant script. On a http
              server, you can process the dump to create a nice adjacency
              matrix.

       -I NUMBER, -interval NUMBER
              Interval between refresh of the dump file. Defaults to 5 secs if
              not specified

       -W URL, -website URL
              Specify a website to announce.

       -Wm URL, -matrix URL
              Specify your matrix URL.

       -Wl URL, -lg URL
              Specify your looking glass URL.

       -C CC  Specify your two letter Country Code.

       -L program
              Launch program after each dump. The first argument will be the
              dump filename.

       -F flag
              Specify a flag to announce. For example to announce that your
              host is running a ssmpingd deamon, use 'ssmping' as a flag.

       -4, -ipv4
              Force IPv4 usage (Default is IPv6).

       -6, -ipv6
              Force IPv6 usage

       -v     verbose mode (use several for more verbosity)

       -U     Dump periodic bandwidth usage reports to stdout

       -D, -daemon
              fork to the background (daemonize)

       -pidfile FILE
              Path to the PID file to write to.

       -syslog
              Outputs using syslog facility.

       -c FILE
              Specifies the configuration file to use. Each of the above
              command-line parameters can be defined there.

       -V, -version
              Outputs version information and leaves

BUGS
       Should be reported to the core developer Hugo Santos
       <hugo@fivebits.net>.

HISTORY
       dbeacon is a joint work of Hugo Santos, Sebastien Chaumontet and
       Mickael Hoerdt. It has been done in the early days of the m6bone, when
       nobody knew if the SPTs or RPTs were being used between hosts and also
       to evaluate the performance and deployment of SSM.
