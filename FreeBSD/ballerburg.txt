NAME
       ballerburg - A castle combat game


SYNOPSIS
       ballerburg


DESCRIPTION
       Ballerburg is a castle combat game. Two players (which can be human or
       computer-controlled) try to destroy the opponent's castle with their
       cannons.

       There are two ways to win the game: Either by directly hitting the
       opponents king with a cannonball, or by destroying enough of the
       opponents commodities so that the king capitulates automatically.


COMMANDS
       Beside the intuitive control of the game with the mouse cursor, there
       are a couple of shortcut keys, too:

       ESC    show the settings dialog

       f      toggle fullscreen mode

       t      show high-score table

       q      quit Ballerburg
