DESCRIPTION
       Panels are curses(3X) windows with the added feature of depth.  Panel
       functions allow the use of stacked windows and ensure the proper
       portions of each window and the curses stdscr window are hidden or
       displayed when panels are added, moved, modified or removed.  The set
       of currently visible panels is the stack of panels.  The stdscr window
       is beneath all panels, and is not considered part of the stack.

       A window is associated with every panel.  The panel routines enable you
       to create, move, hide, and show panels, as well as position a panel at
       any desired location in the stack.

       Panel routines are a functional layer added to curses(3X), make only
       high-level curses calls, and work anywhere terminfo curses does.

FUNCTIONS
   bottom_panel
       bottom_panel(pan) puts panel pan at the bottom of all panels.

   ceiling_panel
       ceiling_panel(sp) acts like panel_below(NULL), for the given SCREEN sp.

   del_panel
       del_panel(pan) removes the given panel pan from the  stack and
       deallocates the PANEL structure (but not its associated window).

   ground_panel
       ground_panel(sp) acts like panel_above(NULL), for the given SCREEN sp.

   hide_panel
       hide_panel(pan) removes the given panel pan from the panel stack and
       thus hides it from view.  The PANEL structure is not lost, merely
       removed from the stack.

   move_panel
       move_panel(pan,starty,startx) moves the given panel pan's window so
       that its upper-left corner is at starty, startx.  It does not change
       the position of the panel in the stack.  Be sure to use this function,
       not mvwin(3X), to move a panel window.

   new_panel
       new_panel(win) allocates  a  PANEL structure, associates it with win,
       places the panel on the top of the stack (causes  it to  be  displayed
       above any other panel) and returns a pointer to the new panel.

   panel_above
       panel_above(pan) returns a pointer to the panel above pan.  If the
       panel argument is (PANEL *)0, it returns a pointer to the bottom panel
       in the stack.

   panel_below
       panel_below(pan) returns a pointer to the panel just below pan.  If the
       panel argument is (PANEL *)0, it returns a pointer to the top panel in
       the stack.

   panel_hidden
       panel_hidden(pan) returns TRUE if the panel pan is in the panel stack,
       FALSE if it is not.  If the panel is a null pointer, return ERR.

   panel_userptr
       panel_userptr(pan) returns the user pointer for a given panel pan.

   panel_window
       panel_window(pan) returns a pointer to the window of the given panel
       pan.

   replace_panel
       replace_panel(pan,window) replaces the current window of panel pan with
       window This is useful, for example if you want to resize a panel.  In
       ncurses, you can call replace_panel to resize a panel using a window
       resized with wresize(3X).  It does not change the position of the panel
       in the stack.

   set_panel_userptr
       set_panel_userptr(pan,ptr) sets the panel's user pointer.

   show_panel
       show_panel(pan) makes a hidden panel visible by placing it on top of
       the panels in the panel stack.  See COMPATIBILITY below.

   top_panel
       top_panel(pan) puts the given visible panel pan on top of all panels in
       the stack.  See COMPATIBILITY below.

   update_panels
       update_panels() refreshes the virtual screen to reflect the relations
       between the panels in the stack, but does not call doupdate(3X) to
       refresh the physical screen.  Use this function and not wrefresh(3X) or
       wnoutrefresh(3X).

       update_panels may be called more than once before a call to doupdate,
       but doupdate is the function responsible for updating the physical
       screen.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Each routine that returns a pointer returns NULL if an error occurs.
       Each routine that returns an int value returns OK if it executes
       successfully and ERR if not.

       Except as noted, the pan and window parameters must be non-null.  If
       those are null, an error is returned.

       The move_panel function uses mvwin(3X), and will return an error if
       mvwin returns an error.

COMPATIBILITY
       Reasonable care has been taken to  ensure  compatibility with  the
       native  panel facility introduced in System V (inspection of the SVr4
       manual pages suggests the programming interface is unchanged).  The
       PANEL data structures are merely  similar.  The  programmer is
       cautioned not to directly use PANEL fields.

       The functions show_panel and top_panel are identical in this
       implementation, and work equally well with displayed or hidden panels.
       In the native System V implementation, show_panel is intended for
       making a hidden panel visible (at the top of the stack) and top_panel
       is intended for making an already-visible panel move to the top of the
       stack.  You are cautioned to use the correct function to ensure
       compatibility with native panel libraries.

NOTE
       In your library list, libpanel.a should be before libncurses.a; that
       is, you should say “-lpanel -lncurses”, not the other way around (which
       would give a link-error with static libraries).

PORTABILITY
       The panel facility was documented in SVr4.2 in Character User Interface
       Programming (UNIX SVR4.2).

       It is not part of X/Open Curses.

       A few implementations exist:

       •   Systems based on SVr4 source code, e.g., Solaris, provide this
           library.

       •   ncurses (since version 0.6 in 1993) and PDCurses (since version 2.2
           in 1995) provide a panel library whose common ancestor was a public
           domain implementation by Warren Tucker published in u386mon 2.20
           (1990).

           According to Tucker, the SystemV panel library was first released
           in SVr3.2 (1988), and his implementation helped with a port to
           SVr3.1 (1987).

           Several developers have improved each of these; they are no longer
           the same as Tucker's implementation.

       •   NetBSD 8 (2018) has a panel library begun by Valery Ushakov in
           2015.  This is based on the AT&T documentation.
