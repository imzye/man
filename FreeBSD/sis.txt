SIS(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 SIS(4)

NAME
     sis – SiS 900, SiS 7016 and NS DP83815/DP83816 Fast Ethernet device
     driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device miibus
           device sis

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_sis_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The sis driver provides support for PCI Ethernet adapters and embedded
     controllers based on the Silicon Integrated Systems SiS 900 and SiS 7016
     Fast Ethernet controller chips.

     This driver also supports adapters based on the National Semiconductor
     DP83815 (MacPhyter) and DP83816 PCI Ethernet controller chip.

     The SiS 900 is a 100Mbps Ethernet MAC and MII-compliant transceiver in a
     single package.  It uses a bus master DMA and a scatter/gather descriptor
     scheme.  The SiS 7016 is similar to the SiS 900 except that it has no
     internal PHY, requiring instead an external transceiver to be attached to
     its MII interface.  The SiS 900 and SiS 7016 both have a 128-bit
     multicast hash filter and a single perfect filter entry for the station
     address.

     The NS DP83815 is also a 100Mbps Ethernet MAC with integrated PHY.  The
     NatSemi chip and the SiS 900 share many of the same features and a fairly
     similar programming interface, hence both chips are supported by the same
     driver.

     The sis driver supports the following media types:

     autoselect   Enable autoselection of the media type and options.  The
                  user can manually override the autoselected mode by adding
                  media options to rc.conf(5).

     10baseT/UTP  Set 10Mbps operation.  The ifconfig(8) mediaopt option can
                  also be used to select either ‘full-duplex’ or ‘half-duplex’
                  modes.

     100baseTX    Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.  The ifconfig(8)
                  mediaopt option can also be used to select either
                  ‘full-duplex’ or ‘half-duplex’ modes.

     The sis driver supports the following media options:

     full-duplex  Force full duplex operation.

     half-duplex  Force half duplex operation.

     For more information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

HARDWARE
     The sis driver supports Silicon Integrated Systems SiS 900 and SiS 7016
     based Fast Ethernet adapters and embedded controllers, as well as Fast
     Ethernet adapters based on the National Semiconductor DP83815 (MacPhyter)
     and DP83816 chips.  Supported adapters include:

     •   @Nifty FNECHARD IFC USUP-TX
     •   MELCO LGY-PCI-TXC
     •   Netgear FA311-TX (DP83815)
     •   Netgear FA312-TX (DP83815)
     •   SiS 630, 635, and 735 motherboard chipsets
     •   Soekris Engineering net45xx, net48xx, lan1621, and lan1641

SYSCTL VARIABLES
     The following variable is available as both sysctl(8) variable and
     loader(8) tunable:

     dev.sis.%unit.manual_pad
             This variable controls how to pad short frames for
             DP83815/DP83816 controllers on the specified device.
             DP83815/DP83816 controllers are known to pad 0xFF for short
             frames which is violation of RFC 1042.  Set this variable to a
             non-zero value to let driver manually pad each short frame with
             zeros at the cost of extra CPU cycles.  The default value is 0 to
             let hardware perform automatic padding.

DIAGNOSTICS
     sis%d: couldn't map ports/memory  A fatal initialization error has
     occurred.

     sis%d: couldn't map interrupt  A fatal initialization error has occurred.

     sis%d: watchdog timeout  The device has stopped responding to the
     network, or there is a problem with the network connection (e.g. a cable
     fault).

     sis%d: no memory for rx list  The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for
     the receiver ring.

     sis%d: no memory for tx list  The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for
     the transmitter ring when allocating a pad buffer or collapsing an mbuf
     chain into a cluster.

     sis%d: chip is in D3 power state -- setting to D0  This message applies
     only to adapters which support power management.  Some operating systems
     place the controller in low power mode when shutting down, and some PCI
     BIOSes fail to bring the chip out of this state before configuring it.
     The controller loses all of its PCI configuration in the D3 state, so if
     the BIOS does not set it back to full power mode in time, it will not be
     able to configure it correctly.  The driver tries to detect this
     condition and bring the adapter back to the D0 (full power) state, but
     this may not be enough to return the driver to a fully operational
     condition.  If you see this message at boot time and the driver fails to
     attach the device as a network interface, you will have to perform a warm
     boot to have the device properly configured.

     Note that this condition only occurs when warm booting from another
     operating system.  If you power down your system prior to booting
     FreeBSD, the card should be configured correctly.
