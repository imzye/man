NAME
       Unix::Groups - Perl to support "getgroups" and "setgroups" syscalls

SYNOPSIS
        use Unix::Groups qw/:all/;

        $ngroups_max=NGROUPS_MAX;
        @gids=getgroups;
        $success=setgroups(@gids);

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements a very thin layer around the getgroups(2) and
       setgroups(2) syscalls. See your system manual for more information.

       Note, the module is written and tested on Linux. For other UNIX-like
       systems there are good chances that it will work at least if it
       compiles properly.

   Functions
       $n=NGROUPS_MAX

       returns the max. number of arguments that "setgroups" will accept.

       @gids=getgroups

       returns the list of supplementary group IDs of the current process.  It
       is very similar to the $( variable. But $( is a string and its first
       element is the current effective GID.

       $success=setgroups @gids

       sets the list of supplementary group IDs of the current process.  On
       most systems this is a privileged operation. On Linux "CAP_SETGID" is
       required.

   EXPORT
       None by default.

       On demand all functions are exported.

       Export tags

       :all
           export all functions.
