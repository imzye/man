NAME
       Astro::DSS - An Object Orientated interface to the Digital Sky Survey

SYNOPSIS
         $dss = new Astro::DSS( RA        => $ra,
                                Dec       => $dec,
                                Target    => $object_name,
                                Equinox   => $equinox,
                                Xsize     => $x_arcmin,
                                Ysize     => $y_arcmin,
                                Survey    => $dss_survey,
                                Format => $type );

         my $file_name = $dss->querydb();

DESCRIPTION
       Stores information about an prospective DSS query and allows the query
       to be made, returning a filename pointing to the file returned.

       The object will by default pick up the proxy information from the
       HTTP_PROXY and NO_PROXY environment variables, see the LWP::UserAgent
       documentation for details.

       It will save returned files into the ESTAR_DATA directory or to TMP if
       the ESTAR_DATA environment variable is not defined.

METHODS
   Constructor
       new Create a new instance from a hash of options

             $dss = new Astro::DSS( RA        => $ra,
                                    Dec       => $dec,
                                    Target    => $object_name,
                                    Equinox   => $equinox,
                                    Xsize     => $x_arcmin,
                                    Ysize     => $y_arcmin,
                                    Survey    => $dss_survey,
                                    Format    => $image_type );

           returns a reference to an DSS query object.

   Accessor Methods
       querydb
           Returns a filename of the image returned from a DSS query.

              $filename = $dss->querydb();

       proxy
           Return (or set) the current proxy for the ADS request.

              $query->proxy( 'http://wwwcache.ex.ac.uk:8080/' );
              $proxy_url = $query->proxy();

       timeout
           Return (or set) the current timeout in seconds for the DSS request.

              $dss->timeout( 30 );
              $proxy_timeout = $dss->timeout();

       url Return (or set) the current base URL for the DSS query.

              $url = $dss->url();
              $query->url( "archive.eso.org" );

           if not defined the default URL is archive.eso.org

       agent
           Returns the user agent tag sent by the module to the ADS server.

              $agent_tag = $dss->agent();

       RA  Return (or set) the current target R.A. defined for the DSS query

              $ra = $dss->ra();
              $dss->ra( $ra );

           where $ra should be a string of the form "HH MM SS.SS", e.g. 21 42
           42.66

       Dec Return (or set) the current target Declination defined for the DSS
           query

              $dec = $dss->dec();
              $dss->dec( $dec );

           where $dec should be a string of the form "+-HH MM SS.SS", e.g. +43
           35 09.5 or -40 25 67.89

       Equinox
           The equinox for the R.A. and Dec co-ordinates

              $equinox = $dss->equinox();
              $dss->equinox( "2000" );

           defaults to 2000.

       Target
           Instead of querying DSS by R.A. and Dec., you may also query it by
           object name. Return (or set) the current target object defined for
           the DSS query, will query SIMBAD for object name resolution.

              $ident = $dss->target();
              $dss->target( "HT Cas" );

           using an object name will override the current R.A. and Dec
           settings for the Query object (if currently set) and the next
           querydb() method call will query DSS using this identifier rather
           than any currently set co-ordinates.

       Xsize
           The x extent of the DSS image to be retrieved in arcmin.

              $xsize = $dss->xsize();
              $dss->xsize( 20 );

           Image sizes for FITS, gzipped FITS and GIF are 260kB, 110kB and 70
           kB respectively for a field of 10*10 arc minutes.  There's a limit
           of around 4 MB for the largest image to be delivered.  Images from
           the DSS2 are bigger, because the pixel size is smaller.

       Ysize
           The y extent of the DSS image to be retrieved in arcmin.

              $xsize = $dss->ysize();
              $dss->ysize( 20 );

           Image sizes for FITS, gzipped FITS and GIF are 260kB, 110kB and 70
           kB respectively for a field of 10*10 arc minutes. There's a limit
           of around 4 MB for the largest image to be delivered. Images from
           the DSS2 are bigger, because the pixel size is smaller.

       Survey
           The survey to return

              $survey = $dss->survey();
              $dss->survey( "DSS1" );

           valid choices are DSS1, DSS2-red, DSS2-blue, DSS2-infrared. The
           entire DSS1 data is stored on magnetic disks at the ESO-ECF
           Archive. DSS2 is stored on DVD-ROM in a juke box. Retrieval time
           takes about less than 5 seconds for a DSS1 field and less than 20
           seconds for a random DSS2 field in the juke box.

           The DSS1 survey is 100% complete, while the DSS2-red now covers 98%
           of the sky; DSS2-blue 45% of the sky and DSS2-infrared 27% of the
           sky.

       Format
           The image format required

              $format = $dss->format();
              $dss->format( "FITS" );

           valid format types are FITS and GIF and FITS.gz. The default is to
           return a GIF Image.

   General Methods
       configure
           Configures the object, takes an options hash as an argument

             $dss->configure( %options );

           Does nothing if the array is not supplied.
