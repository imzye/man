NAME
       sigrot - .signature file rotator

SYNOPSIS
       sigrot [-r | -on | -off] [[-w | -a] filename]

DESCRIPTION
       sigrot allows multiple .signature files to be stored in one "archive"
       file.  Each time sigrot is called, it gets the next signature from the
       "archive" file and copies it into the .signature.

       The first time you use sigrot, you will need a file containing multiple
       signatures.  Each signature should be seperated by a single blank line.
       Only a linefeed character, and no other white space charaters may be on
       this line. (If you should like to have a blank line appear in a
       signature, you could add a white space character to the line so sigrot
       knows that the following lines are part of the same signature.)  Just
       type:

       sigrot -w filename

       Now type sigrot and check the .signature file to see if sigrot
       successfully copied the first signature from the archive file.

       You may delete filename later, or move it, it is longer needed by
       sigrot.  Sigrot makes its own copy of the file.

       You may find it annoying to constantly have to type sigrot to get the
       next signature.  You may prefer to have it run automatically each time
       you run your mail program.  To do this you can write a simple script
       file.  For instance, I use pine to read my mail, so I would make a
       script called pine in my home dir. (Or anywhere in my path before the
       actual location of the pine program.)  Such as:
            #!/bin/sh
            sigrot
            /usr/bin/pine

OPTIONS
       -o filename
              Overwrite signature archive with filename.

       -a filename
              Append filename to the end of the signature archive.

       -r     Restores the previous signature archive.

       -off   Turns off the use of the signature archive file. ( preffix and
              suffix files, if they exist, will still be written to the
              .signature file.)  Be careful with this command.  I added it at
              the last moment.  While it works just fine, if you were to use
              the -w or -a parameters after -off, you will lose the previous
              signature archive.  So be sure to turn the signature archive -on
              before using -w or -a.

       -on    Turns use of the signature archive file back on. (-r parameter
              would perform the same function.)

FILES
       ~/.sigrot
              Per user directory conaining all of sigrot's files.
       ~/.sigrot/sig_archive
              Archive file containing all of the signatures. (Each signature
              seperated by a BLANK line)
       ~/.sigrot/next
              File containing an integer, which is the number of the next
              signature to copy from the archive file.
       ~/.sigrot/prefix
              Optional file.  The contents of this file will appear at the
              beginning of every .signature file that is written.
       ~/.sigrot/suffix
              Optional file.  The contents of this file will appear at the end
              of every .signature file that is written.

BUGS/FEATURES
       The signature entries in the source file must each be seperated by a
       BLANK line.  This blank line cannot contain any other white-space
       characters.
