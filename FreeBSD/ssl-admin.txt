NAME
       ssl-admin - OpenSSL Certificate Manager

SYNOPSIS
       ssl-admin


DESCRIPTION
       ssl-admin is a menu-driven tool designed to simplify the management and
       distriibution of SSL certificates.  ssl-admin was originally written to
       manage SSL certificates for use with OpenVPN.  This functionality has
       not been removed.


CORE FUNCTIONS
       There are a number of core operations within ssl-admin, often times
       mutually exlusive of one another.  For example, you cannot generate a
       new CA certificate and generate a client certificate all at once.


       --new-ca
              This command will generate a new root certificate and key pair
              and store the new files in work-dir.  If you add the optional
              --clean argument, you will wipe out the existing certificate
              store.


       --int-ca
              This command will generate an intermediate CA certficate which
              can be used for signing sub keys, etc.


       --client-cert, --ccert
              This will generate a client signing request, certificate, and
              key.


       --server-cert, --scert
              This will generate a client signing request, certificate, and
              key, with server extensions enabled.


       --dh, --diffie-hellman
              Generates the Diffie-Hellman prime.


       --revoke
              Used to revoke a certificate in the store.


       --crl-list
              This outputs a list of revoked certificates.


DIRECTORIES
       There are a number of directories within /usr/local/etc/ssl-admin/
       which contain the working and datafiles.

       ACTIVE (/usr/local/etc/ssl-admin/active)
              The active directory contains certificates that have not been
              revoked. The only keys that are REQUIRED to be present are
              ca.crt and ca.key.


       CSR (/usr/local/etc/ssl-admin/csr)
              The csr directory contains certificate signing requests and keys
              for those keys which have been created using ssl-admin.  If you
              need to sign a certificate signing request generated elsewhere,
              place the .csr here. The key files are not required to be
              present.


       PACKAGES (/usr/local/etc/ssl-admin/packages)
              The packages directory contains any zipped packages you've built
              with ssl-admin.  Packages are generally used to distribute
              signed certificates to end users.


       PROG (/usr/local/etc/ssl-admin/prog)
              The prog directory contains all the data files used by ssl-
              admin.  DO NOT EDIT OR MODIFY THE FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY unless
              you know exactly what you are doing.  If you are running
              OpenVPN, you may point your OpenVPN crl-verify config option to
              /usr/local/etc/ssl-admin/prog/crl.pem.


       REVOKED (/usr/local/etc/ssl-admin/revoked)
              The revoked directory contains certificates and keys for those
              certificates that have been revoked within ssl-admin.
