NAME
     cc_vegas – Vegas Congestion Control Algorithm

DESCRIPTION
     The Vegas congestion control algorithm uses what the authors term the
     actual and expected transmission rates to determine whether there is
     congestion along the network path i.e.

           actual rate = (total data sent in a RTT) / RTT

           expected rate = cwnd / RTTmin

           diff = expected - actual

     where RTT is the measured instantaneous round trip time and RTTmin is the
     smallest round trip time observed during the connection.

     The algorithm aims to keep diff between two parameters alpha and beta,
     such that:

           alpha < diff < beta

     If diff > beta, congestion is inferred and cwnd is decremented by one
     packet (or the maximum TCP segment size).  If diff < alpha, then cwnd is
     incremented by one packet.  Alpha and beta govern the amount of buffering
     along the path.

     The implementation was done in a clean-room fashion, and is based on the
     paper referenced in the SEE ALSO section below.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
     The time from the transmission of a marked packet until the receipt of an
     acknowledgement for that packet is measured once per RTT.  This
     implementation does not implement Brakmo's and Peterson's original
     duplicate ACK policy since clock ticks in today's machines are not as
     coarse as they were (i.e. 500ms) when Vegas was originally designed.
     Note that modern TCP recovery processes such as fast retransmit and SACK
     are enabled by default in the TCP stack.

MIB Variables
     The algorithm exposes the following tunable variables in the
     net.inet.tcp.cc.vegas branch of the sysctl(3) MIB:

     alpha      Query or set the Vegas alpha parameter as a number of buffers
                on the path.  When setting alpha, the value must satisfy: 0 <
                alpha < beta.  Default is 1.

     beta       Query or set the Vegas beta parameter as a number of buffers
                on the path.  When setting beta, the value must satisfy: 0 <
                alpha < beta.  Default is 3.
