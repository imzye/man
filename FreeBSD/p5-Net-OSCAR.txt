NAME
       Net::OSCAR - Implementation of AOL's OSCAR protocol for instant
       messaging (for interacting with AIM a.k.a. AOL IM a.k.a. AOL Instant
       Messenger - and ICQ, too!)

VERSION
       version 1.928

SYNOPSIS
               use Net::OSCAR qw(:standard);

               sub im_in {
                       my($oscar, $sender, $message, $is_away) = @_;
                       print "[AWAY] " if $is_away;
                       print "$sender: $message\n";
               }

               $oscar = Net::OSCAR->new();
               $oscar->set_callback_im_in(\&im_in);
               $oscar->signon($screenname, $password);
               while(1) {
                       $oscar->do_one_loop();
                       # Do stuff
               }

INSTALLATION
   HOW TO INSTALL
               perl Build.PL
               perl Build
               perl Build test
               perl Build install

       See "perldoc Module::Build" for details.  Note that this requires that
       you have the perl module Module::Build installed.  If you don't, the
       traditional "perl Makefile.PL ; make ; make test ; make install" should
       still work.

   DEPENDENCIES
       This modules requires "Digest::MD5" and "Scalar::Util".  "Test::More"
       is needed to run the test suite, and "XML::Parser" is needed to
       generate the XML parse tree which is shipped with released versions.

INTRODUCTION
   ABSTRACT
       "Net::OSCAR" implements the OSCAR protocol which is used by AOL's AOL
       Instant Messenger service.  To use the module, you create a
       "Net::OSCAR" object, register some functions as handlers for various
       events by using the module's callback mechanism, and then continually
       make calls to the module's event processing methods.

       You probably want to use the ":standard" parameter when importing this
       module in order to have a few important constants added to your
       namespace.  See "CONSTANTS" below for a list of the constants exported
       by the ":standard" tag.

       No official documentation exists for the OSCAR protocol, so it had to
       be figured out by analyzing traffic generated by AOL's official AOL
       Instant Messenger client.  Source code from the Gaim client, the
       protocol analysis provided by the Ethereal network sniffer, and the
       Alexander Shutko's website <http://iserverd1.khstu.ru/oscar/> were also
       used as references.

       This module strives to be as compatible with "Net::AIM" as possible at
       the API level, but some protocol-level differences prevent total
       compatibility.  The TOC protocol implemented by "Net::AIM" is simpler
       than OSCAR and has official reference documentation from AOL, but it
       only provides a small subset of the full "OSCAR" functionality.  See
       the section on "Net::AIM Compatibility" for more information.

   EVENT PROCESSING OVERVIEW
       Event processing is the implementation of "Net::OSCAR" within the
       framework of your program, so that your program can respond to things
       happening on the OSCAR servers while still doing everything else that
       you need it to do, such as accepting user input.  There are three main
       ways for the module to handle event processing.  The simplest is to
       call the do_one_loop method, which performs a "select" call on all the
       object's sockets and reads incoming commands from the OSCAR server on
       any connections which have them.  The "select" call has a default
       timeout of 0.01 seconds which can be adjusted using the timeout method.
       This means that every time you call do_one_loop, it will pause for that
       interval if there are no messages from the OSCAR server.  If you need
       lower overhead, want better performance, or need to handle many
       Net::OSCAR objects and/or other files and sockets at once, see "HIGH-
       PERFORMANCE EVENT PROCESSING" below.

   FUNCTIONALITY
       "Net::OSCAR" pretends to be WinAIM 5.5.3595.  It supports remote
       buddylists including permit and deny settings.  It also supports chat,
       buddy icons, and extended status messages.  At the present time,
       setting and retrieving of directory information is not supported; nor
       are email privacy settings, voice chat, stock ticker, file transfer,
       direct IM, and many other of the official AOL Instant Messenger
       client's features.

   TERMINOLOGY
       When you sign on with the OSCAR service, you are establishing an OSCAR
       session.

   CALLBACKS
       "Net::OSCAR" uses a callback mechanism to notify you about different
       events.  A callback is a function provided by you which "Net::OSCAR"
       will call when a certain event occurs.  To register a callback, calling
       the "set_callback_callbackname" method with a code reference as a
       parameter.  For instance, you might call
       "$oscar->set_callback_error(\&got_error);".  Your callback function
       will be passed parameters which are different for each callback type
       (and are documented below).  The first parameter to each callback
       function will be the "Net::OSCAR" object which generated the callback.
       This is useful when using multiple "Net::OSCAR" objects.

REFERENCE
   BASIC FUNCTIONALITY
       METHODS

       new ([capabilities => CAPABILITIES], [rate_manage => RATE_MANAGE_MODE])
           Creates a new "Net::OSCAR" object.  You may optionally pass a hash
           to set some parameters for the object.

           capabilities
               A listref of optional features that your client supports.
               Valid capabilities are:

               extended_status
                   iChat-style extended status messages

               buddy_icons
               file_transfer
               file_sharing
               typing_status
                   Typing status notification

               buddy_list_transfer
           rate_manage
               Which mechanism will your application be using to deal with the
               sending rates which the server enforces on the client?  See
               "RATE LIMIT OVERVIEW" for more information on the subject.

               OSCAR_RATE_MANAGE_NONE
               OSCAR_RATE_MANAGE_AUTO
               OSCAR_RATE_MANAGE_MANUAL

                   $oscar = Net::OSCAR->new(capabilities => [qw(extended_status typing_status)], rate_manage => OSCAR_RATE_MANAGE_AUTO);

       signon (HASH)
       signon (SCREENNAME, PASSWORD[, HOST, PORT]
           Sign on to the OSCAR service.  You can specify an alternate
           host/port to connect to.  The default is login.oscar.aol.com port
           5190.

           The non-hash form of "signon" is obsolete and is only provided for
           compatibility with "Net::AIM".  If you use a hash to pass
           parameters to this function, here are the valid keys:

           screenname
           password
               Screenname and password are mandatory.  The other keys are
               optional.  In the special case of password being present but
               undefined, the auth_challenge callback will be used - see
               "auth_challenge" for details.

           stealth
               Use this to sign on with stealth mode activated.  Using this,
               as opposed to signon on without this setting and then calling
               "set_stealth", will prevent the user from showing as online for
               a brief interval after signon.  See "set_stealth" for
               information about stealth mode.

           pass_is_hashed
               If you want to give Net::OSCAR the MD5 hash of the password
               instead of the password itself, use the MD5'd password in the
               password key and also set this key.  The benefit of this is
               that, if your application saves user passwords, you can save
               them in hashed form and don't need to store the plaintext.

           local_ip
               If you have more than one IP address with a route to the
               internet, this parameter can be used to specify which to use as
               the source IP for outgoing connections.

           local_port
               This controls which port Net::OSCAR will listen on for incoming
               direct connections.  If not specified, a random port will be
               selected.

           host
           port
           proxy_type
               Either "SOCKS4", "SOCKS5", "HTTP", or HTTPS.  This and
               "proxy_host" must be specified if you wish to use a proxy.
               "proxy_port", "proxy_username", "proxy_password" are optional.
               Note that proxy support is considered experimental.  You will
               need to have the "Net::SOCKS" module installed for SOCKS
               proxying or the "LWP::UserAgent" module installed for HTTP
               proxying.

           proxy_host
           proxy_port
           proxy_username
           proxy_password

           If the screenname is all-numeric, it will automatically be treated
           as an ICQ UIN instead of an AIM screenname.

       signoff
           Sign off from the OSCAR service.

       CALLBACKS

       signon_done (OSCAR)
           Called when the user is completely signed on to the service.

   BUDDIES AND BUDDYLISTS
       See also "OTHER USERS" for methods which pertain to any other user,
       regardless of whether they're on the buddylist or not.

       METHODS

       findbuddy (BUDDY)
           In scalar context, returns the name of the group that BUDDY is in,
           or undef if BUDDY could not be found in any group.  If BUDDY is in
           multiple groups, will return the first one we find.

           In list context, returns a two-element list consisting of the group
           name followed by the group hashref (or the empty list of the buddy
           is not found.)

       commit_buddylist
           Sends your modified buddylist to the OSCAR server.  Changes to the
           buddylist won't actually take effect until this method is called.
           Methods that change the buddylist have a warning about needing to
           call this method in their documentation.  After calling this
           method, your program MUST not call it again until either the
           buddylist_ok or buddylist_error callbacks are received.

       rollback_buddylist
           Revert changes you've made to the buddylist, assuming you haven't
           called "commit_buddylist" since making them.

       reorder_groups (GROUPS)
           Changes the ordering of the groups in your buddylist.  Call
           "commit_buddylist" to save the new order on the OSCAR server.

       reorder_buddies (GROUP, BUDDIES)
           Changes the ordering of the buddies in a group on your buddylist.
           Call "commit_buddylist" to save the new order on the OSCAR server.

       rename_group (OLDNAME, NEWNAME)
           Renames a group.  Call "commit_buddylist" for the change to take
           effect.

       add_buddy (GROUP, BUDDIES)
           Adds buddies to the given group on your buddylist.  If the group
           does not exist, it will be created.  Call "commit_buddylist" for
           the change to take effect.

       remove_buddy (GROUP, BUDDIES)
           See add_buddy.

       add_group (GROUP)
           Creates a new, empty group.  Call "commit_buddylist" for the change
           to take effect.

       remove_group (GROUP)
           See add_group.  Any buddies in the group will be removed from the
           group first.

       groups
           Returns a list of groups in the user's buddylist.

       buddies (GROUP)
           Returns the names of the buddies in the specified group in the
           user's buddylist.  The names may not be formatted - that is, they
           may have spaces and capitalization removed.  The names are
           "Net::OSCAR::Screenname" objects, so you don't have to worry that
           they're case and whitespace insensitive when using them for
           comparison.

       buddy (BUDDY[, GROUP])
           Returns information about a buddy on the user's buddylist.  This
           information is a hashref as per "USER INFORMATION" below.

       set_buddy_comment (GROUP, BUDDY[, COMMENT])
           Set a brief comment about a buddy.  You must call
           "commit_buddylist" to save the comment to the server.  If COMMENT
           is undefined, the comment is deleted.

       set_buddy_alias (GROUP, BUDDY[, ALIAS])
           Set an alias for a buddy.  You must call "commit_buddylist" to save
           the comment to the server.  If ALIAS is undefined, the alias is
           deleted.

       buddylist_limits
           Returns a hash containing the maximum number of buddylist entries
           of various types.  The keys in the hash are:

           •   buddies

           •   groups

           •   permits

           •   denies

           So, the maximum number of buddies allowed on a buddylist is stored
           in the "buddies" key.  Please note that buddylist storage has some
           overhead, so the actual number of items you can have on a buddylist
           may be slightly less than advertised.

           If the OSCAR server did not inform us of the limits, values of 0
           will be used.

       CALLBACKS

       buddy_in (OSCAR, SCREENNAME, GROUP, BUDDY DATA)
           SCREENNAME (in buddy group GROUP) has signed on, or their
           information has changed.  BUDDY DATA is the same as that returned
           by the buddy method.

       buddy_out (OSCAR, SCREENNAME, GROUP)
           Called when a buddy has signed off (or added us to their deny
           list.)

       buddylist_error (OSCAR, ERROR, WHAT)
           This is called when there is an error commiting changes to the
           buddylist.  "ERROR" is the error number.  "WHAT" is a string
           describing which buddylist change failed.  "Net::OSCAR" will revert
           the failed change to its state before "commit_buddylist" was
           called.  Note that the buddylist contains information other than
           the user's buddies - see any method which says you need to call
           "commit_buddylist" to have its changes take effect.

       buddylist_ok (OSCAR)
           This is called when your changes to the buddylist have been
           successfully commited.

       buddylist_changed (OSCAR, CHANGES)
           This is called when your buddylist is changed by the server.  The
           most common reason for this to happen is if the screenname you are
           signed on with is also signed on somewhere else, and the buddylist
           is changed in the other session.

           Currently, only changes to buddies and groups will be listed in
           "CHANGES".  Changes to privacy settings and any other portions of
           the buddylist will not be included in the list in the current
           version of "Net::OSCAR".

           "CHANGES" is a list of hash references, one for each change to the
           buddylist, with the following keys:

           •   type: Either "MODBL_WHAT_BUDDY" or "MODBL_WHAT_GROUP".  This
               indicates if the change was to a buddy or a group.

           •   action: Either "MODBL_ACTION_DEL" or "MODBL_ACTION_ADD".  This
               indicates whether the change was an addition/modification or a
               deletion.

           •   group: The name of the group which the modification took place
               in.  For "MODBL_WHAT_BUDDY", this will be the name of the group
               which the changed buddy was changed in; for "MODBL_WHAT_GROUP",
               this will be the name of the group which was changed.

           •   buddy: This key is only present for "MODBL_WHAT_BUDDY".  It's
               the name of the buddy which was changed.

           The "MODBL_*" constants come from "Net::OSCAR::Common", and are
           included in the ":standard" export list.

   PRIVACY
       "Net::OSCAR" supports privacy controls.  Our visibility setting, along
       with the contents of the permit and deny lists, determines who can
       contact us.  Visibility can be set to permit or deny everyone, permit
       only those on the permit list, deny only those on the deny list, or
       permit everyone on our buddylist.

       METHODS

       add_permit (BUDDIES)
           Add buddies to your permit list.  Call "commit_buddylist" for the
           change to take effect.

       add_deny (BUDDIES)
           See add_permit.

       remove_permit (BUDDIES)
           See add_permit.

       remove_deny (BUDDIES)
           See add_permit.

       get_permitlist
           Returns a list of all members of the permit list.

       get_denylist
           Returns a list of all members of the deny list.

       visibility
           Returns the user's current visibility setting.  See set_visibility.

       set_visibility (MODE)
           Sets the visibility mode, which determines how the permit and deny
           lists are interpreted.  Note that if you're looking for the feature
           which will prevent a user from showing up as online on any buddy
           list while not affecting anything else, the droids you're looking
           for are "is_stealth"/"set_stealth".

           The visibility mode may be:

           •   VISMODE_PERMITALL: Permit everybody.

           •   VISMODE_DENYALL: Deny everybody.

           •   VISMODE_PERMITSOME: Permit only those on your permit list.

           •   VISMODE_DENYSOME: Deny only those on your deny list.

           •   VISMODE_PERMITBUDS: Same as VISMODE_PERMITSOME, but your permit
               list is made to be the same as the buddies from all the various
               groups in your buddylist (except the deny group!)  Adding and
               removing buddies maintains this relationship.  You shouldn't
               manually alter the permit or deny groups when using this
               visibility mode.

           These constants are contained in the "Net::OSCAR::Common" package,
           and will be imported into your namespace if you import "Net::OSCAR"
           with the ":standard" parameter.

           When someone is permitted, they can see when you are online and
           send you messages.  When someone is denied, they can't see when you
           are online or send you messages.  You cannot see them or send them
           messages.  You can talk to them if you are in the same chatroom,
           although neither of you can invite the other one into a chatroom.

           Call "commit_buddylist" for the change to take effect.

       is_stealth
       set_stealth STEALTH_STATUS
           These methods deal with "stealth mode".  When the user is in
           stealth mode, she won't show up as online on anyone's buddylist.
           However, for all other purposes, she will be online as usual.  Any
           restrictions, imposed by the visibility mode (see
           "set_visibility"), on who can communicate with her will remain in
           effect.

           Stealth state can be changed by another signon of the user's
           screenname.  So, if you want your application to be aware of the
           stealth state, "is_stealth" won't cut it; there's a
           "stealth_changed" callback which will serve nicely.

       set_group_permissions (NEWPERMS)
           Set group permissions.  This lets you block any OSCAR users or any
           AOL users.  "NEWPERMS" should be a list of zero or more of the
           following constants:

           GROUPPERM_OSCAR
               Permit AOL Instant Messenger users to contact you.

           GROUPPERM_AOL
               Permit AOL subscribers to contact you.

           Call "commit_buddylist" for the change to take effect.

       group_permissions
           Returns current group permissions.  The return value is a list like
           the one that "set_group_permissions" wants.

   OTHER USERS
       See also "BUDDIES AND BUDDYLISTS".

       METHODS

       get_info (WHO)
           Requests a user's information, which includes their profile and
           idle time.  See the buddy_info callback for more information.

       get_away (WHO)
           Similar to get_info, except requests the user's away message
           instead of their profile.

       send_im (WHO, MESSAGE[, AWAY])
           Sends someone an instant message.  If the message is an automated
           reply generated, perhaps, because you have an away message set,
           give the AWAY parameter a non-zero value.  Note that "Net::OSCAR"
           will not handle sending away messages to people who contact you
           when you are away - you must perform this yourself if you want it
           done.

           Returns a "request ID" that you can use in the "im_ok" callback to
           identify the message.  If the message was too long to send, returns
           zero.

       send_typing_status (RECIPIENT, STATUS)
           Send a typing status change to another user.  Send these messages
           to implement typing status notification.  Valid values for "STATUS"
           are:

           •   TYPINGSTATUS_STARTED: The user has started typing to the
               recipient.  This indicates that typing is actively taking
               place.

           •   TYPINGSTATUS_TYPING: The user is typing to the recipient.  This
               indicates that there is text in the message input area, but
               typing is not actively taking place at the moment.

           •   TYPINGSTATUS_FINISHED: The user has finished typing to the
               recipient.  This should be sent when the user starts to compose
               a message, but then erases all of the text in the message input
               area.

       evil (WHO[, ANONYMOUSLY])
           "Evils", or "warns", a user.  Evilling a user increases their evil
           level, which makes them look bad and decreases the rate at which
           they can send messages.  Evil level gradually decreases over time.
           If the second parameter is non-zero, the evil will be done
           anonymously, which does not increase the user's evil level by as
           much as a standard evil.

           You can't always evil someone.  You can only do it when they do
           something like send you an instant message.

       get_icon (SCREENNAME, MD5SUM)
           Gets a user's buddy icon.  See set_icon for details.  To make sure
           this method isn't called excessively, please check the
           "icon_checksum" and "icon_timestamp" data, which are available via
           the buddy method (even for people not on the user's buddy list.)
           The MD5 checksum of a user's icon will be in the "icon_md5sum" key
           returned by buddy.

           You should receive a buddy_icon_downloaded callback in response to
           this method.

       CALLBACKS

       new_buddy_icon (OSCAR, SCREENNAME, BUDDY DATA)
           This is called when someone, either someone the user is talking
           with or someone on their buddylist, has a potentially new buddy
           icon.  The buddy data is guaranteed to have at least
           "icon_checksum" available; "icon_timestamp" and "icon_length" may
           not be.  Specifically, if "Net::OSCAR" found out about the buddy
           icon through a buddy status update (the sort that triggers a
           buddy_in callback), these data will not be available; if
           "Net::OSCAR" found out about the icon via an incoming IM from the
           person, these data will be available.

           Upon receiving this callback, an application should use the
           "icon_checksum" to search for the icon in its cache, and call
           get_icon if it can't find it.  If the "icon_md5sum", which is what
           needs to get passed to get_icon, is not present in the buddy data,
           use get_info to request the information for the user, and then call
           get_icon from the buddy_info callback.

       buddy_icon_downloaded (OSCAR, SCREENNAME, ICONDATA)
           This is called when a user's buddy icon is successfully downloaded
           from the server.

       typing_status (OSCAR, SCREENNAME, STATUS)
           Called when someone has sent us a typing status notification
           message.  See send_typing_status for a description of the different
           statuses.

       im_ok (OSCAR, TO, REQID)
           Called when an IM to "TO" is successfully sent.  REQID is the
           request ID of the IM as returned by "send_im".

       im_in (OSCAR, FROM, MESSAGE[, AWAY])
           Called when someone sends you an instant message.  If the AWAY
           parameter is non-zero, the message was generated as an automatic
           reply, perhaps because you sent that person a message and they had
           an away message set.

       buddylist_in (OSCAR, FROM, BUDDYLIST)
           Called when someone sends you a buddylist.  You must set the
           "buddy_list_transfer" capability for buddylists to be sent to you.
           The buddylist will be a "Net::OSCAR::Buddylist" hashref whose keys
           are the groups and whose values are listrefs of
           "Net::OSCAR::Screenname" strings for the buddies in the group.

       buddy_info (OSCAR, SCREENNAME, BUDDY DATA)
           Called in response to a get_info or get_away request.  BUDDY DATA
           is the same as that returned by the buddy method, except that one
           of two additional keys, "profile" and "awaymsg", may be present.

   THE SIGNED-ON USER
       These methods deal with the user who is currently signed on using a
       particular "Net::OSCAR" object.

       METHODS

       email
           Returns the email address currently assigned to the user's account.

       screenname
           Returns the user's current screenname, including all capitalization
           and spacing.

       is_on
           Returns true if the user is signed on to the OSCAR service.
           Otherwise, returns false.

       profile
           Returns your current profile.

       set_away (MESSAGE)
           Sets the user's away message, also marking them as being away.  If
           the message is undef or the empty string, the user will be marked
           as no longer being away.  See also "get_away".

       set_extended_status (MESSAGE)
           Sets the user's extended status message.  This requires the
           "Net::OSCAR" object to have been created with the "extended_status"
           capability.  Currently, the only clients which support extended
           status messages are Net::OSCAR, Gaim, and iChat.  If the message is
           undef or the empty string, the user's extended status message will
           be cleared.  Use "get_info" to get another user's extended status.

       set_info (PROFILE)
           Sets the user's profile.  Call "commit_buddylist" to have the new
           profile saved into the buddylist, so that it will be set the next
           time the screenname is signed on.  (This is a Net::OSCAR-specific
           feature, so other clients will not pick up the profile from the
           buddylist.)

           Note that Net::OSCAR stores the user's profile in the server-side
           buddylist, so if "commit_buddylist" is called after setting the
           profile with this method, the user will automatically get that same
           profile set whenever they sign on through Net::OSCAR.  See the file
           "PROTOCOL", included with the "Net::OSCAR" distribution, for
           details of how we're storing this data.

           Use "get_info" to retrieve another user's profile.

       set_icon (ICONDATA)
           Sets the user's buddy icon.  The "Net::OSCAR" object must have been
           created with the "buddy_icons" capability to use this.  "ICONDATA"
           must be less than 4kb, should be 48x48 pixels, and should be BMP,
           GIF, or JPEG image data.  You must call commit_buddylist for this
           change to take effect.  If "ICONDATA" is the empty string, the
           user's buddy icon will be removed.

           When reading the icon data from a file, make sure to call "binmode"
           on the file handle.

           Note that if the user's buddy icon was previously set with
           Net::OSCAR, enough data will be stored in the server-side buddylist
           that this will not have to be called every time the user signs on.
           However, other clients do not store the extra data in the
           buddylist, so if the user previously set a buddy icon with a
           non-Net::OSCAR-based client, this method will need to be called in
           order for the user's buddy icon to be set properly.

           See the file "PROTOCOL", included with the "Net::OSCAR"
           distribution, for details of how we're storing this data.

           You should receive a buddy_icon_uploaded callback in response to
           this method.

           Use "get_icon" to retrieve another user's icon.

       change_password (CURRENT PASSWORD, NEW PASSWORD)
           Changes the user's password.

       confirm_account
           Confirms the user's account.  This can be used when the user's
           account is in the trial state, as determined by the presence of the
           "trial" key in the information given when the user's information is
           requested.

       change_email (NEW EMAIL)
           Requests that the email address registered to the user's account be
           changed.  This causes the OSCAR server to send an email to both the
           new address and the old address.  To complete the change, the user
           must follow instructions contained in the email sent to the new
           address.  The email sent to the old address contains instructions
           which allow the user to cancel the change within three days of the
           change request.  It is important that the user's current email
           address be known to the OSCAR server so that it may email the
           account password if the user forgets it.

       format_screenname (NEW FORMAT)
           Allows the capitalization and spacing of the user's screenname to
           be changed.  The new format must be the same as the user's current
           screenname, except that case may be changed and spaces may be
           inserted or deleted.

       set_idle (TIME)
           Sets the user's idle time in seconds.  Set to zero to mark the user
           as not being idle.  Set to non-zero once the user becomes idle.
           The OSCAR server will automatically increment the user's idle time
           once you mark the user as being idle.

       CALLBACKS

       admin_error (OSCAR, REQTYPE, ERROR, ERRURL)
           This is called when there is an error performing an administrative
           function - changing your password, formatting your screenname,
           changing your email address, or confirming your account.  REQTYPE
           is a string describing the type of request which generated the
           error.  ERROR is an error message.  ERRURL is an http URL which the
           user may visit for more information about the error.

       admin_ok (OSCAR, REQTYPE)
           This is called when an administrative function succeeds.  See
           admin_error for more info.

       buddy_icon_uploaded (OSCAR)
           This is called when the user's buddy icon is successfully uploaded
           to the server.

       stealth_changed (OSCAR, NEW_STEALTH_STATE)
           This is called when the user's stealth state changes.  See
           "is_stealth" and "set_stealth" for information on stealth.

       extended_status (OSCAR, STATUS)
           Called when the user's extended status changes.  This will normally
           be sent in response to a successful set_extended_status call.

       evil (OSCAR, NEWEVIL[, FROM])
           Called when your evil level changes.  NEWEVIL is your new evil
           level, as a percentage (accurate to tenths of a percent.)  ENEMY is
           undef if the evil was anonymous (or if the message was triggered
           because your evil level naturally decreased), otherwise it is the
           screenname of the person who sent us the evil.  See the "evil"
           method for more information on evils.

   FILE TRANSFER AND DIRECT CONNECTIONS
       file_send SCREENNAME MESSAGE FILEREFS
           "FILEDATA" can be undef to have Net::OSCAR read the file, a file
           handle, or the data to send.

   EVENT PROCESSING
       METHODS

       do_one_loop
           Processes incoming data from our connections to the various OSCAR
           services.  This method reads one command from any connections which
           have data to be read.  See the timeout method to set the timeout
           interval used by this method.

       process_connections (READERSREF, WRITERSREF, ERRORSREF)
           Use this method when you want to implement your own "select"
           statement for event processing instead of using "Net::OSCAR"'s
           do_one_loop method.  The parameters are references to the readers,
           writers, and errors parameters used by the select statement.  The
           method will ignore all connections which are not
           "Net::OSCAR::Connection" objects or which are
           "Net::OSCAR::Connection" objects from a different "Net::OSCAR"
           object.  It modifies its arguments so that its connections are
           removed from the connection lists.  This makes it very convenient
           for use with multiple "Net::OSCAR" objects or use with a
           "select"-based event loop that you are also using for other
           purposes.

           See the selector_filenos method for a way to get the necessary bit
           vectors to use in your "select".

       CALLBACKS

       connection_changed (OSCAR, CONNECTION, STATUS)
           Called when the status of a connection changes.  The status is
           "read" if we should call "process_one" on the connection when
           "select" indicates that the connection is ready for reading,
           "write" if we should call "process_one" when the connection is
           ready for writing, "readwrite" if "process_one" should be called in
           both cases, or "deleted" if the connection has been deleted.

           "CONNECTION" is a "Net::OSCAR::Connection" object.

           Users of this callback may also be interested in the
           "get_filehandle" method of "Net::OSCAR::Connection".

   CHATS
       METHODS

       chat_join (NAME[, EXCHANGE])
           Creates (or joins?) a chatroom.  The exchange parameter should
           probably not be specified unless you know what you're doing.  Do
           not use this method to accept invitations to join a chatroom - use
           the "chat_accept" method for that.

       chat_accept (CHATURL)
           Use this to accept an invitation to join a chatroom.

       chat_decline (CHATURL)
           Use this to decline an invitation to join a chatroom.

       CALLBACKS

       chat_buddy_in (OSCAR, SCREENNAME, CHAT, BUDDY DATA)
           SCREENNAME has entered CHAT.  BUDDY DATA is the same as that
           returned by the buddy method.

       chat_buddy_out (OSCAR, SCREENNAME, CHAT)
           Called when someone leaves a chatroom.

       chat_im_in (OSCAR, FROM, CHAT, MESSAGE)
           Called when someone says something in a chatroom.  Note that you
           receive your own messages in chatrooms unless you specify the
           NOREFLECT parameter in chat_send.

       chat_invite (OSCAR, WHO, MESSAGE, CHAT, CHATURL)
           Called when someone invites us into a chatroom.  MESSAGE is the
           message that they specified on the invitation.  CHAT is the name of
           the chatroom.  CHATURL is a chat URL and not a
           "Net::OSCAR::Connection::Chat" object.  CHATURL can be passed to
           the chat_accept method to accept the invitation.

       chat_joined (OSCAR, CHATNAME, CHAT)
           Called when you enter a chatroom.  CHAT is the
           "Net::OSCAR::Connection::Chat" object for the chatroom.

       chat_closed (OSCAR, CHAT, ERROR)
           Your connection to CHAT (a "Net::OSCAR::Connection::Chat" object)
           was severed due to ERROR.

   RATE LIMITS
       See "RATE LIMIT OVERVIEW" for more information on rate limits.

       METHODS

       rate_level (OSCAR, METHODNAME[, CHAT])
           Returns the rate level (one of "RATE_CLEAR", "RATE_ALERT",
           "RATE_LIMIT", "RATE_DISCONNECT") which the OSCAR session is
           currently at for the "Net::OSCAR" (or
           "Net::OSCAR::Connection::Chat") method named "METHODNAME" right
           now.  This only makes sense for methods which send information to
           the OSCAR server, such as "send_im", but if you pass in a method
           name which doesn't make sense (or isn't actually a "Net::OSCAR"
           method, or which isn't rate-limited), we'll gladly an empty list.
           This method is not available if your application is using
           "OSCAR_RATE_MANAGE_NONE".

           If "METHODNAME" is "chat_send", you should also pass the
           "Net::OSCAR::Connection::Chat" object to get rate information on
           (as the "CHAT" parameter.)

       rate_limits (OSCAR, METHODNAME[, CHAT])
           Similar to "rate_level".  This returns the boundaries of the
           different rate level categories for the given method name, in the
           form of a hash with the following keys (this won't make sense if
           you don't know how the current level is calculated; see below):

           window_size
           levels
               A hashref with keys for each of the levels.  Each key is the
               name of a level, and the value for that key is the threshold
               for that level.

               clear
               alert
               limit
               disconnect
           last_time
               The time at which the last command to affect this rate level
               was sent.

           current_state
               The session's current rate level.

           Every time a command is sent to the OSCAR server, the level is
           recalculated according to the formula (from Alexandr Shutko's OSCAR
           documentation, <http://iserverd.khstu.ru/oscar/>:

                   NewLevel = (Window - 1)/Window * OldLevel + 1/Window * CurrentTimeDiff

           "CurrentTimeDiff" is the difference between the current system time
           and "last_time".

       would_make_rate_level (OSCAR, METHODNAME[, CHAT])
           Returns the rate level which your session would be at if
           "METHODNAME" were sent right now.  See "rate_level" for more
           information.

       CALLBACKS

       rate_alert (OSCAR, LEVEL, CLEAR, WINDOW, WORRISOME, VIRTUAL)
           This is called when you are sending commands to OSCAR too quickly.

           "LEVEL" is one of "RATE_CLEAR", "RATE_ALERT", "RATE_LIMIT", or
           "RATE_DISCONNECT" from the "Net::OSCAR::Common" package (they are
           imported into your namespace if you import "Net::OSCAR" with the
           ":standard" parameter.)  "RATE_CLEAR" means that you're okay.
           "RATE_ALERT" means you should slow down.  "RATE_LIMIT" means that
           the server is ignoring messages from you until you slow down.
           "RATE_DISCONNECT" means you're about to be disconnected.

           "CLEAR" and "WINDOW" tell you the maximum speed you can send in
           order to maintain "RATE_CLEAR" standing.  You must send no more
           than "WINDOW" commands in "CLEAR" milliseconds.  If you just want
           to keep it simple, you can just not send any commands for "CLEAR"
           milliseconds and you'll be fine.

           "WORRISOME" is nonzero if "Net::OSCAR" thinks that the alert is
           anything worth worrying about.  Otherwise it is zero.  This is very
           rough, but it's a good way for the lazy to determine whether or not
           to bother passing the alert on to their users.

           A "VIRTUAL" rate limit is one which your application would have
           incurred, but you're using automatic rate management, so we stopped
           something from being sent out.

   MISCELLANEOUS
       METHODS

       timeout ([NEW TIMEOUT])
           Gets or sets the timeout value used by the do_one_loop method.  The
           default timeout is 0.01 seconds.

       loglevel ([LOGLEVEL[, SCREENNAME DEBUG]])
           Gets or sets the level of logging verbosity.  If this is non-zero,
           varing amounts of information will be printed to standard error
           (unless you have a "log" callback defined).  Higher loglevels will
           give you more information.  If the optional screenname debug
           parameter is non-zero, debug messages will be prepended with the
           screenname of the OSCAR session which is generating the message
           (but only if you don't have a "log" callback defined).  This is
           useful when you have multiple "Net::OSCAR" objects.

           See the "log" callback for more information.

       auth_response (MD5_DIGEST[, PASS_IS_HASHED])
           Provide a response to an authentication challenge - see the
           "auth_challenge" callback for details.

       clone
           Clones the object.  This creates a new "Net::OSCAR" object whose
           callbacks, loglevel, screenname debugging, and timeout are the same
           as those of the current object.  This is provided as a convenience
           when using multiple "Net::OSCAR" objects in order to allow you to
           set those parameters once and then call the signon method on the
           object returned by clone.

       buddyhash
           Returns a reference to a tied hash which automatically normalizes
           its keys upon a fetch.  Use this for hashes whose keys are AIM
           screennames since AIM screennames with different capitalization and
           spacing are considered equivalent.

           The keys of the hash as returned by the "keys" and "each" functions
           will be "Net::OSCAR::Screenname" objects, so you they will
           automagically be compared without regards to case and whitespace.

       findconn (FILENO)
           Finds the connection that is using the specified file number, or
           undef if the connection could not be found.  Returns a
           "Net::OSCAR::Connection" object.

       selector_filenos
           Returns a list whose first element is a vec of all filehandles that
           we care about reading from and whose second element is a vec of all
           filehandles that we care about writing to.  See the
           "process_connections" method for details.

       icon_checksum (ICONDATA)
           Returns a checksum of the buddy icon.  Use this in conjunction with
           the "icon_checksum" buddy info key to cache buddy icons.

       get_app_data ([GROUP[, BUDDY]])
           Gets application-specific data.  Returns a hashref whose keys are
           app-data IDs.  IDs with high-order byte 0x0001 are reserved for
           non-application-specific usage and must be registered with the
           "libfaim-aim-protocol@lists.sourceforge.net" list.  If you wish to
           set application-specific data, you should reserve a high-order byte
           for your application by emailing
           "libfaim-aim-protocol@lists.sourceforge.net".  This data is stored
           in your server-side buddylist and so will be persistent, even
           across machines.

           If "GROUP" is present, a hashref for accessing data specific to
           that group is returned.

           If "BUDDY" is present, a hashref for accessing data specific to
           that buddy is returned.

           Call "commit_buddylist" to have the new data saved on the OSCAR
           server.

       chat_invite (CHAT, MESSAGE, WHO)
           Deprecated.  Provided for compatibility with "Net::AIM".  Use the
           appropriate method of the "Net::OSCAR::Connection::Chat" object
           instead.

       chat_leave (CHAT)
           Deprecated.  Provided for compatibility with "Net::AIM".  Use the
           appropriate method of the "Net::OSCAR::Connection::Chat" object
           instead.

       chat_send (CHAT, MESSAGE)
           Deprecated.  Provided for compatibility with "Net::AIM".  Use the
           appropriate method of the "Net::OSCAR::Connection::Chat" object
           instead.

       CALLBACKS

       auth_challenge (OSCAR, CHALLENGE, HASHSTR)
           New for Net::OSCAR 2.0: AOL Instant Messenger has changed their
           encryption mechanisms; instead of using the password in the hash,
           you may now use the MD5 hash of the password.  This allows your
           application to save the user's password in hashed form instead of
           plaintext if you're saving passwords.  You must pass an extra
           parameter to "auth_response" indicating that you are using the new
           encryption scheme.  See below for an example.

           OSCAR uses an MD5-based challenge/response system for
           authentication so that the password is never sent in plaintext over
           the network.  When a user wishes to sign on, the OSCAR server sends
           an arbitrary number as a challenge.  The client must respond with
           the MD5 digest of the concatenation of, in this order, the
           challenge, the password, and an additional hashing string
           (currently always the string "AOL Instant Messenger (SM)", but it
           is possible that this might change in the future.)

           If password is undefined in "signon", this callback will be
           triggered when the server sends a challenge during the signon
           process.  The client must reply with the MD5 digest of CHALLENGE .
           MD5(password) . HASHSTR.  For instance, using the MD5::Digest
           module:

                   my($oscar, $challenge, $hashstr) = @_;
                   my $md5 = Digest::MD5->new;
                   $md5->add($challenge);
                   $md5->add(md5("password"));
                   $md5->add($hashstr);
                   $oscar->auth_response($md5->digest, 1);

           Note that this functionality is only available for certain
           services.  It is available for AIM but not ICQ.  Note also that the
           MD5 digest must be in binary form, not the more common hex or
           base64 forms.

       log (OSCAR, LEVEL, MESSAGE)
           Use this callback if you don't want the log_print methods to just
           print to STDERR.  It is called when even "MESSAGE" of level "LEVEL"
           is called.  The levels are, in order of increasing importance:

           OSCAR_DBG_NONE
               Really only useful for setting in the "loglevel" method.  No
               information will be logged.  The default loglevel.

           OSCAR_DBG_PACKETS
               Hex dumps of all incoming/outgoing packets.

           OSCAR_DBG_DEBUG
               Information useful for debugging "Net::OSCAR", and precious
               little else.

           OSCAR_DBG_SIGNON
               Like "OSCAR_DBG_NOTICE", but only for the signon process; this
               is where problems are most likely to occur, so we provide this
               for the common case of people who only want a lot of
               information during signon.  This may be deprecated some-day and
               be replaced by a more flexible facility/level system, ala
               syslog.

           OSCAR_DBG_NOTICE
           OSCAR_DBG_INFO
           OSCAR_DBG_WARN

           Note that these symbols are imported into your namespace if and
           only if you use the ":loglevels" or ":all" tags when importing the
           module (e.g. "use Net::OSCAR qw(:standard :loglevels)".)

           Also note that this callback is only triggered for events whose
           level is greater than or equal to the loglevel for the OSCAR
           session.  The "loglevel" method allows you to get or set the
           loglevel.

   ERROR HANDLING
       CALLBACKS

       error (OSCAR, CONNECTION, ERROR, DESCRIPTION, FATAL)
           Called when any sort of error occurs (except see admin_error below
           and buddylist_error in "BUDDIES AND BUDDYLISTS".)

           "CONNECTION" is the particular connection which generated the error
           - the "log_print" method of "Net::OSCAR::Connection" may be useful,
           as may be getting "$connection->{description}".  "DESCRIPTION" is a
           nicely formatted description of the error.  "ERROR" is an error
           number.

           If "FATAL" is non-zero, the error was fatal and the connection to
           OSCAR has been closed.

       snac_unknown (OSCAR, CONNECTION, SNAC, DATA)
           Called when Net::OSCAR receives a message from the OSCAR server
           which it doesn't known how to handle.  The default handler for this
           callback will print out the unknown SNAC.

           "CONNECTION" is the "Net::OSCAR::Connection" object on which the
           unknkown message was received.  "SNAC" is a hashref with keys such
           as "family", "subtype", "flags1", and "flags2".

CHAT CONNECTIONS
       Aside from the methods listed here, there are a couple of methods of
       the "Net::OSCAR::Connection::Chat" object that are important for
       implementing chat functionality.  "Net::OSCAR::Connection::Chat" is a
       descendent of "Net::OSCAR::Connection".

       invite (WHO, MESSAGE)
           Invite somebody into the chatroom.

       chat_send (MESSAGE[, NOREFLECT[, AWAY]])
           Sends a message to the chatroom.  If the NOREFLECT parameter is
           present, you will not receive the message as an incoming message
           from the chatroom.  If AWAY is present, the message was generated
           as an automatic reply, perhaps because you have an away message
           set.

       part
           Leave the chatroom.

       url Returns the URL for the chatroom.  Use this to associate a chat
           invitation with the chat_joined that "Net::OSCAR" sends when you've
           join the chatroom.

       name
           Returns the name of the chatroom.

       exchange
           Returns the exchange of the chatroom.  This is normally 4 but can
           be 5 for certain chatrooms.

RATE LIMIT OVERVIEW
       The OSCAR server has the ability to specify restrictions on the rate at
       which the client, your application, can send it commands.  These
       constraints can be independently set and tracked for different classes
       of command, so there might be one limit on how fast you can send IMs
       and another on how fast you can request away messages.  If your
       application exceeds these limits, the OSCAR server may start ignoring
       it or may even disconnect your session.

       See also the reference section on rate limits.

   RATE MANAGEMENT MODES
       "Net::OSCAR" supports three different schemes for managing these
       limits.  Pass the scheme you want to use as the value of the
       "rate_manage" key when you invoke the "new" method.

       OSCAR_RATE_MANAGE_NONE

       The default.  "Net::OSCAR" will not keep track of what the limits are,
       much less how close you're coming to reaching them.  If the OSCAR
       server complains that you are sending too fast, your "rate_alert"
       callback will be triggered.

       OSCAR_RATE_MANAGE_AUTO

       In this mode, "Net::OSCAR" will prevent your application from exceeding
       the limits.  If you try to send a command which would cause the limits
       to be exceeded, your command will be queued.  You will be notified when
       this happens via the "rate_alert" callback.  This mode is only
       available if your application implements "Net::OSCAR"'s time-delayed
       event system.

       OSCAR_RATE_MANAGE_MANUAL

       In this mode, "Net::OSCAR" will track what the limits are and how close
       you're coming to reaching them, but won't do anything about it.  Your
       application should use the "rate_level", "rate_limits", and
       "would_make_rate_level" methods to control its own rate.

TIME-DELAYED EVENTS
CONSTANTS
       The following constants are defined when "Net::OSCAR" is imported with
       the ":standard" tag.  Unless indicated otherwise, the constants are
       magical scalars - they return different values in string and numeric
       contexts (for instance, an error message and an error number.)

       ADMIN_TYPE_PASSWORD_CHANGE
       ADMIN_TYPE_EMAIL_CHANGE
       ADMIN_TYPE_SCREENNAME_FORMAT
       ADMIN_TYPE_ACCOUNT_CONFIRM
       ADMIN_ERROR_UNKNOWN
       ADMIN_ERROR_BADPASS
       ADMIN_ERROR_BADINPUT
       ADMIN_ERROR_BADLENGTH
       ADMIN_ERROR_TRYLATER
       ADMIN_ERROR_REQPENDING
       ADMIN_ERROR_CONNREF
       VISMODE_PERMITALL
       VISMODE_DENYALL
       VISMODE_PERMITSOME
       VISMODE_DENYSOME
       VISMODE_PERMITBUDS
       RATE_CLEAR
       RATE_ALERT
       RATE_LIMIT
       RATE_DISCONNECT
       OSCAR_RATE_MANAGE_NONE
       OSCAR_RATE_MANAGE_AUTO
       OSCAR_RATE_MANAGE_MANUAL
       GROUPPERM_OSCAR
       GROUPPERM_AOL
       TYPINGSTATUS_STARTED
       TYPINGSTATUS_TYPING
       TYPINGSTATUS_FINISHED

Net::AIM Compatibility
       Here are the major differences between the "Net::OSCAR" interface and
       the "Net::AIM" interface:

       •   No get/set method.

       •   No newconn/getconn method.

       •   No group parameter for add_permit or add_deny.

       •   Many differences in chat handling.

       •   No chat_whisper.

       •   No encode method - it isn't needed.

       •   No send_config method - it isn't needed.

       •   No send_buddies method - we don't keep a separate local buddylist.

       •   No normalize method - it isn't needed.  Okay, there is a normalize
           function in "Net::OSCAR::Utility", but I can't think of any reason
           why it would need to be used outside of the module internals.
           "Net::OSCAR" provides the same functionality through the
           "Net::OSCAR::Screenname" class.

       •   Different callbacks with different parameters.

MISCELLANEOUS INFO
       There are two programs included with the "Net::OSCAR" distribution.
       "oscartest" is half a reference implementation of a "Net::OSCAR" client
       and half a tool for testing this library.  "snacsnatcher" is a tool
       designed for analyzing the OSCAR protocol from libpcap-format packet
       captures, but it isn't particularly well-maintained; the Ethereal
       sniffer does a good job at this nowadays.

       There is a class "Net::OSCAR::Screenname".  OSCAR screennames are case
       and whitespace insensitive, and if you do something like "$buddy = new
       Net::OSCAR::Screenname "Matt Sachs"" instead of "$buddy = "Matt
       Sachs"", this will be taken care of for you when you use the string
       comparison operators (eq, ne, cmp, etc.)

       "Net::OSCAR::Connection", the class used for connection objects, has
       some methods that may or may not be useful to you.

       get_filehandle
           Returns the filehandle used for the connection.  Note that this is
           a method of "Net::OSCAR::Connection", not "Net::OSCAR".

       process_one (CAN_READ, CAN_WRITE, HAS_ERROR)
           Call this when a "Net::OSCAR::Connection" is ready for reading
           and/or writing.  You might call this yourself instead of using
           "process_connections" when, for instance, using the
           "connection_changed" callback in conjunction with "IO::Poll"
           instead of "select".  The "CAN_READ" and "CAN_WRITE" parameters
           should be non-zero if the connection is ready for the respective
           operations to be performed and zero otherwise.  If and only if
           there was a socket error with the connection, set "HAS_ERROR" to
           non-zero.

       session
           Returns the "Net::OSCAR" object associated with this
           "Net::OSCAR::Connection".

USER INFORMATION
       Methods which return information about a user, such as "buddy", will
       return the information in the form of a hash.  The keys of the hash are
       the following -- note that any of these may be absent.

       online
           The user is signed on.  If this key is not present, all of the
           other keys may not be present.

       screenname
           The formatted version of the user's screenname.  This includes all
           spacing and capitalization.  This is a "Net::OSCAR::Screenname"
           object, so you don't have to worry about the fact that it's case
           and whitespace insensitive when comparing it.

       comment
           A user-defined comment associated with the buddy.  See
           "set_buddy_comment".  Note that this key will be present but
           undefined if there is no comment.

       alias
           A user-defined alias for the buddy.  See "set_buddy_alias".  Note
           that this key will be present but undefined if there is no alias.

       extended_status
           The user's extended status message, if one is set, will be in this
           key.  This requires that you set the "extended_status" capability
           when creating the "Net::OSCAR" object.

       trial
           The user's account has trial status.

       aol The user is accessing the AOL Instant Messenger service from
           America OnLine.

       free
           Opposite of aol.

       away
           The user is away.

       admin
           The user is an administrator.

       mobile
           The user is using a mobile device.

       typing_status
           The user is known to support typing status notification.  We only
           find this out if they send us an IM.

       capabilities
           The user's capabilities.  This is a reference to a hash whose keys
           are the user's capabilities, and whose values are descriptions of
           their respective capabilities.

       icon
           The user's buddy icon, if available.

       icon_checksum
           The checksum time of the user's buddy icon, if available.  Use
           this, in conjunction with the icon_checksum method, to cache buddy
           icons.

       icon_timestamp
           The modification timestamp of the user's buddy icon, if available.

       icon_length
           The length of the user's buddy icon, if available.

       membersince
           Time that the user's account was created, in the same format as the
           "time" function.

       onsince
           Time that the user signed on to the service, in the same format as
           the "time" function.

       idle_since
           Time, in seconds since Jan 1st 1970, since which the user has been
           idle.  This will only be present if the user is idle.  To figure
           out how long the user has been idle for, subtract this value from
           time() .

       evil
           Evil (warning) level for the user.

       Some keys; namely, "typing_status" and "icon_checksum", may be
       available for people who the user has communicated with but who are not
       on the user's buddylist.

ICQ-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
       ICQ support isn't nearly as well-tested as AIM support, and ICQ-
       specific features aren't being particularly actively developed.
       Patches for ICQ-isms are welcome.  The initial patch enabling us to
       sign on to ICQ was provided by Sam Wong.

   ICQ METHODS
       get_icq_info (UIN)
           Requests ICQ-specific information.  See also the "buddy_icq_info"
           callback.

HIGH-PERFORMANCE EVENT PROCESSING
       A second way of doing event processing is designed to make it easy to
       integrate "Net::OSCAR" into an existing "select"-based event loop,
       especially one where you have many "Net::OSCAR" objects.  Simply call
       the "process_connections" method with references to the lists of
       readers, writers, and errors given to you by "select".  Connections
       that don't belong to the object will be ignored, and connections that
       do belong to the object will be removed from the "select" lists so that
       you can use the lists for your own purposes.  Here is an example that
       demonstrates how to use this method with multiple "Net::OSCAR" objects:

               my $ein = $rin | $win;
               select($rin, $win, $ein, 0.01);
               foreach my $oscar(@oscars) {
                       $oscar->process_connections(\$rin, \$win, \$ein);
               }

               # Now $rin, $win, and $ein only have the file descriptors not
               # associated with any of the OSCAR objects in them - we can
               # process our events.

       The third way of doing connection processing uses the
       "connection_changed" callback in conjunction with
       "Net::OSCAR::Connection"'s "process_one" method.  This method, in
       conjunction with "IO::Poll", probably offers the highest performance in
       situations where you have a long-lived application which creates and
       destroys many "Net::OSCAR" sessions; that is, an application whose list
       of file descriptors to monitor will likely be sparse.  However, this
       method is the most complicated.  What you need to do is call
       "IO::Poll::mask" inside of the "connection_changed" callback.  That
       part's simple.  The tricky bit is figuring out which
       "Net::OSCAR::Connection::process_one"'s to call and how to call them.
       My recommendation for doing this is to use a hashmap whose keys are the
       file descriptors of everything you're monitoring in the "IO::Poll" -
       the FDs can be retrieved by doing fileno($connection->get_filehandle)
       inside of the "connection_changed" - and then calling "@handles =
       $poll->handles(POLLIN | POLLOUT | POLLERR | POLLHUP)" and walking
       through the handles.

       For optimum performance, use the "connection_changed" callback.

HISTORY
       •   1.925, 2006-02-06

           •   Many buddylist performance enhancements and bug fixes.

           •   Added support for receiving dynamic buddylist changes from the
               server ("callback_buddylist_changed".)

           •   Add support buddylist transfer ("set_callback_buddylist_in".)

           •   Miscellaneous performance and scalability enhancements.

           •   Added experimental migration support.

           •   Added advanced rate limit management API.

           •   Added "oscarserv" server for testing.

           •   Audited screennames exposed to application to verify that they
               are "Net::OSCAR::Screenname" objects everywhere.

           •   Began work on file transfer.

           •   Connection status fix for compatibility with POE.

       •   1.907, 2004-09-22

           •   Fixed assert failure on certain invalid input ("Buddy Trikill"
               crash)

       •   1.906, 2004-08-28

           •   Reorganized documentation

       •   1.904, 2004-08-26

           •   Add $Net::OSCAR::XML::NO_XML_CACHE to prevent use of cached XML
               parse tree, and skip tests if we can't load Test::More or
               XML::Parser.

       •   1.903, 2004-08-26

           •   Generate XML parse tree at module build time so that users
               don't need to have XML::Parser and expat installed.

       •   1.902, 2004-08-26

           •   Fixes to buddy icon upload and chat invitation decline

           •   Increase performance by doing lazy generation of certain
               debugging info

       •   1.901, 2004-08-24

           •   Lots of buddylist-handling bug fixes; should fix intermittent
               buddylist modification errors and errors only seen when
               modifying certain screennames; Roy C. rocks.

           •   We now require Perl 5.6.1.

           •   Workaround for bug in Perl pre-5.8.4 which manifested as a
               "'basic OSCAR services' isn't numeric" warning followed by the
               program freezing.

           •   "add_group" and "remove_group" methods added.

           •   Fixed a potential memory leak which could impact programs which
               create many transient Net::OSCAR objects.

       •   1.900, 2004-08-17

           •   Wrote new XML-based protocol back-end with reasonably
               comprehensive test-suite.  Numerous protocol changes; we now
               emulate AOL's version 5.5 client.

           •   Rewrote snacsnatcher, an OSCAR protocol analysis tool

           •   Reorganized documentation

           •   ICQ meta-info support: get_icq_info method, buddy_icq_info
               callback

           •   Stealth mode support: is_stealth and set_stealth methods,
               stealth_changed callback, stealth signon key

           •   More flexible unknown SNAC handling: snac_unknown callback

           •   Application can give Net::OSCAR the MD5-hashed password instead
               of the cleartext password (pass_is_hashed signon key).  This is
               useful if your application is storing user passwords.

           •   Inability to set blocking on Win32 is no longer fatal.  Silly
               platform.

           •   Fixed chat functionality.

       •   1.11, 2004-02-13

           •   Fixed presence-related problems modifying some buddylists

       •   1.10, 2004-02-10

           •   Fixed idle time handling; user info hashes now have an
               'idle_since' key, which you should use instead of the old
               'idle' key.  Subtract "idle_since" from time() to get the
               length of time for which the user has been idle.

           •   Fixed buddylist type 5 handling; this fixes problems modifying
               the buddylists of recently-created screennames.

       •   1.01, 2004-01-06

           •   Fixed buddy ID generation (problems adding buddies)

       •   1.00, 2004-01-03

               between calls to commit_buddylist

           •   Fixed handling of idle time (zoyboy22)

           •   More flexible signon method

           •   Added buddy alias support

           •   Buddy icon support

           •   Typing notification support

           •   mac.com screenname support

           •   Support for communicating with ICQ users from AIM

           •   iChat extended status message support

           •   We now emulate AOL Instant Messenger for Windows 5.2

           •   We now parse the capabilities of other users

           •   Attempts at Win32 (non-cygwin) support

       •   0.62, 2002-02-25

           •   Error handling slightly improved; error 29 is no longer
               unknown.

           •   A minor internal buddylist enhancement

           •   snacsnatcher fixes

       •   0.61, 2002-02-17

           •   Net::OSCAR is now in beta!

           •   We now work with perl 5.005 and even 5.004

           •   Try to prevent weird Net::OSCAR::Screenname bug where perl gets
               stuck in Perl_sv_2bool

           •   Fixed problems with setting visibility mode and adding to deny
               list (thanks, Philip)

           •   Added some methods to allow us to be POE-ified

           •   Added guards around a number of methods to prevent the user
               from trying to do stuff before s/he's finished signing on.

           •   Fix *incredibly* stupid error in NO_to_BLI that ate group names

           •   Fixed bad bug in log_printf

           •   New method: im_ok

           •   New method: rename_group, should fix "Couldn't get group name"
               error.

           •   Fix for buddy_in callback and data

           •   Better error handling when we can't resolve a host

           •   Vastly improved logging infrastructure - debug_print(f)

               log and has an extra parameter.

           •   Fixed MANIFEST - we don't actually use Changes (and we do use
               Screenname.pm)

           •   blinternal now automagically enforces the proper structure (the
               right things become Net::OSCAR::TLV tied hashes and the name
               and data keys are automatically created) upon vivification.
               So, you can do $bli->{0}->{1}->{2}->{data}->{0x3} = "foo"
               without worrying if 0, 1, 2, or data have been tied.  Should
               close bug #47.

       •   0.08, 2001-09-07

           •   Totally rewritten buddylist handling.  It is now much cleaner,
               bug-resistant, and featureful.

           •   Many, many internal changes that I don't feel like enumerating.
               Hey, there's a reason that I haven't declared the interface
               stable yet! ;)

           •   New convenience object: Net::OSCAR::Screenname

           •   Makefile.PL: Fixed perl version test and compatibility with BSD
               make

       •   0.07, 2001-08-13

           •   A bunch of Makefile.PL fixes

           •   Fixed spurious admin_error callback and prevent user from

               #39)

           •   Head off some potential problems with set_visibility.  (closes
               #34)

           •   We now explicitly perl 5.6.0 or newer.

       •   0.06, 2001-08-12

           •   Prevent sending duplicate signon_done messages

           •   Don't addconn after crapping out!

           •   Don't try to delconn unless we have connections.

           •   delete returns the correct value now in Net::OSCAR::Buddylist.

           •   Don't use warnings if $] <= 5.005

           •   evil is a method, not a manpage (doc fix)

           •   Added buddyhash method.

           •   Added a debug_print callback.

           •   Clarified process_connections method in documentation

           •   You can now specify an alternate host/port in signon

           •   Added name method to Chat.

           •   permit list and deny list are no longer part of buddylist

           •   Rewrote buddylist parsing (again!)

           •   snacsnatcher: Remove spurious include of Net::OSCAR::Common

           •   We don't need to handle VISMODE_PERMITBUDS ourself - the server
               takes care of it.  Thanks, VB!

           •   Makefile.PL: Lots of way cool enhancements to make dist:

               -   It modifies the version number for us

               -   It does a CVS rtag

               -   It updates the HTML documentation on zevils and the README.

           •   Added Scalar::Utils::dualvar variables, especially to
               Common.pm.  dualvar variables return different values in
               numeric and string context.
