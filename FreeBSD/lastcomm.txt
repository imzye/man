LASTCOMM(1)             FreeBSD General Commands Manual            LASTCOMM(1)

NAME
     lastcomm – show last commands executed

SYNOPSIS
     lastcomm [-EScesu] [-f file] [+format] [command ...] [user ...]
              [terminal ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The lastcomm utility gives information on previously executed commands.
     With no arguments, lastcomm prints information about all the commands
     recorded during the current accounting file's lifetime.

     The following options are available:

     -E      Print the time the process exited.

     -S      Print the time the process started.

     -c      Print the amount of cpu time used by the process.

     -e      Print the amount of elapsed time used by the process.

     -s      Print the amount of system time used by the process.

     -u      Print the amount of user time used by the process.

     -f file
             Read from file rather than the default /var/account/acct.  If
             file is a single dash (‘-’) lastcomm reads accounting entries
             from the standard input.

     An operand with a leading plus sign (‘+’) is followed a user-defined
     format string which specifies the format in which to display the
     process's start or exit date and time.  The format string may contain any
     of the conversion specifications described in the strftime(3) manual
     page, as well as arbitrary text.

     If no options are specified, -cS is assumed.  If lastcomm is invoked with
     arguments, only accounting entries with a matching command name, user
     name, or terminal name are printed.  For example:

           lastcomm a.out root ttyd0

     would produce a listing of all the executions of commands named a.out by
     user root on the terminal ttyd0.

     For each process entry, the following are printed.

           •   The name of the user who ran the process.
           •   Flags, as accumulated by the accounting facilities in the
               system.
           •   The command name under which the process was called.
           •   The amount of CPU (-c), wall (-e), system (-s), or user (-u)
               time used by the process (in seconds).
           •   The time the process started (-S) or exited (-E).

     The flags are encoded as follows: ``S'' indicates the command was
     executed by the super-user, ``F'' indicates the command ran after a fork,
     but without a following exec(3), ``D'' indicates the command terminated
     with the generation of a core file, and ``X'' indicates the command was
     terminated with a signal.

     By default, accounting entries are printed going backwards in time,
     starting from the time lastcomm was executed.  However, if lastcomm reads
     entries from its standard input, then entries are printed in the order
     they are read.

FILES
     /var/account/acct  default accounting file

EXAMPLES
     The command
           lastcomm -Ee
     will print the exit time and elapsed time of each command logged in
     /var/account/acct, while
           tail -f -c 0 /var/account/acct | lastcomm -f -
     will print details of each terminating command.
