NAME
     MD5, MD5Init, MD5Transform – message digest routines

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/md5.h>

     void
     MD5Init(MD5_CTX *buf);

     void
     MD5Transform(uint32_t buf[4], const unsigned char block[64]);

DESCRIPTION
     The MD5 module implements the RSA Data Security, Inc. MD5 Message-Digest
     Algorithm (MD5).  It produces 128-bit MD5 Digest of data.

     MD5Init          must be called just before MD5Transform() will be used
                      to produce a digest.  The buf argument is the storage
                      for the digest being produced on subsequent calls to the
                      MD5Transform() routine.

     MD5Transform     is the core of the MD5 algorithm, this alters an
                      existing MD5 hash kept in buf to reflect the addition of
                      64 characters of new data passed in block argument.

COPYRIGHTS
     The code for MD5 transform was taken from Colin Plumb's implementation,
     which has been placed in the public domain.  The MD5 cryptographic
     checksum was devised by Ronald Rivest, and is documented in RFC 1321,
     "The MD5 Message Digest Algorithm".
