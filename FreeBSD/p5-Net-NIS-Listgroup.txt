Net::NIS::Listgroup(3)                     User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Listgroup.pm - Lists hosts/users in a netgroup group.

SYNOPSIS
           use Listgroup;

           $array_ref_groups = listgroup();
           $array_ref_groups = listgroups();

           $array_ref_users_or_groups = listgroup({groupname});

           $array_ref_users_or_groups = listgroup_user({groupname1},
                   [ [-]{groupname2}, [-]{gropuname3} ]);

           $array_ref_users_or_groups = listgroup_host({groupname1},
                   [ [-]{groupname2}, [-]{gropuname3} ]);

DESCRIPTION
       A library used to get groups or members of a netgroup NIS map.
       listgroup() without any parameters or listgroups() lists all the
       available netgroup groups.

       With groupname parameters listgroup, listgroup_user, listgroup_host
       will recusively list the members of the named groups.  If the groupname
       is preceded with a - members of that group will be excluded from the
       returned list.  Each member in a group is a triplet of
       (host,user,domain).  The host portion or user portion of the members is
       returned by listgroup_host() and listgroup(), the user portion of the
       members is returned by listgroup_user().

REQUIRES
       Net::NIS

PUBLIC METHODS
   listgroups
           $array_ref_groups = listgroups();

       Returns a reference to an array of groups from the netgroup nis map.

   listgroup_host, listgroup
           $array_ref_users_or_groups = listgroup({groupname1},
                   [ [-]{groupname2}, [-]{gropuname3} ]);

           $array_ref_users_or_groups = listgroup_host({groupname1},
                   [ [-]{groupname2}, [-]{gropuname3} ]);

       Returns a reference to an array of the host portion of the members of
       the provided groups.  Members of groupnames preceded by a - will be
       excluded from the returned list.

       Groups are processed in the order they appear in the parameter list.

       If the NIS map 'netgroup' does not exist or another fatal NIS error
       occurs, die will be called.  Wrap this call in an eval if you want to
       catch that type of error.

   listgroup_user
           $array_ref_users_or_groups = listgroup_user({groupname1},
                   [ [-]{groupname2}, [-]{gropuname3} ]);

       Returns a reference to an array of the user portion of the members of
       the provided groups.  Members of groupnames preceded by a - will be
       excluded from the returned list.

       Groups are processed in the order they appear in the parameter list.

       If the NIS map 'netgroup' does not exist or another fatal NIS error
       occurs, die will be called.  Wrap this call in an eval if you want to
