NAME
     mmc – MultiMediaCard and SD Card bus driver

SYNOPSIS
     device mmc

DESCRIPTION
     The mmc driver implements the MMC and SD Card bus.  The mmc driver
     supports all MMC and SD bridges in the system.  All SD or MMC cards in
     the system attach to an instance of mmc.  The mmc bus typically has only
     one slot, and only memory cards.  MultiMediaCards exist only in memory.
     SD Cards exist as memory, I/O, or combination cards.
