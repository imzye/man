NAME
       xiphos-nav - Navigating Xiphos to a verse reference

SYNOPSIS
       xiphos-nav URL


DESCRIPTION
       xiphos-nav is a command line utility which induce Xiphos to react to a
       URL request using dbus.  Invoke it as e.g. 'xiphos-nav
       sword://ESV/Gen.1.1'. Normal use is that it's used as your desktop
       environment's handler for sword:// URLs.  If dbus access attempt fails,
       it concludes that Xiphos is not running and starts a new Xiphos with
       that URL.  With this, you can click URLs of that sort in web pages and
       so forth, and Xiphos will be navigated for you.  The dbus interface
       also supports a search interface, used by bibledit.
