NAME
       assemble - Assemble Perl bytecode

SYNOPSIS
         assemble [-d] [bytecode.asm | -] [bytecode.plc]

DESCRIPTION
       Compiles an ascii bytecode as produced by disassemble to binary
       bytecode assembler.

       "bytecode" is a binary file wih either the magic 4 bytes 'PLBC' at the
       start, or something like "#! /usr/bin/perl\n use ByteLoader '0.07'",
       typically with the .plc or .pmc extension.

       If filename is -, the input is read from STDIN and you can still
       provide an output filename.

OPTION -d
       Prints some debugging information.
