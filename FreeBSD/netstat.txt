DESCRIPTION
     The netstat command symbolically displays the contents of various
     network-related data structures.  There are a number of output formats,
     depending on the options for the information presented.

     netstat [-46AaLnRSTWx] [-f protocol_family | -p protocol] [-M core]
             [-N system]
             Display a list of active sockets (protocol control blocks) for
             each network protocol.

             The default display for active sockets shows the local and remote
             addresses, send and receive queue sizes (in bytes), protocol, and
             the internal state of the protocol.  Address formats are of the
             form “host.port” or “network.port” if a socket's address
             specifies a network but no specific host address.  When known,
             the host and network addresses are displayed symbolically
             according to the databases hosts(5) and networks(5),
             respectively.  If a symbolic name for an address is unknown, or
             if the -n option is specified, the address is printed
             numerically, according to the address family.  For more
             information regarding the Internet IPv4 “dot format”, refer to
             inet(3).  Unspecified, or “wildcard”, addresses and ports appear
             as “*”.

             --libxo
                     Generate output via libxo(3) in a selection of different
                     human and machine readable formats.  See xo_parse_args(3)
                     for details on command line arguments.

             -4      Show IPv4 only.  See GENERAL OPTIONS.

             -6      Show IPv6 only.  See GENERAL OPTIONS.

             -A      Show the address of a protocol control block (PCB)
                     associated with a socket; used for debugging.

             -a      Show the state of all sockets; normally sockets used by
                     server processes are not shown.

             -L      Show the size of the various listen queues.  The first
                     count shows the number of unaccepted connections, the
                     second count shows the amount of unaccepted incomplete
                     connections, and the third count is the maximum number of
                     queued connections.

             -n      Do not resolve numeric addresses and port numbers to
                     names.  See GENERAL OPTIONS.

             -P      Display the log ID for each socket.

             -R      Display the flowid and flowtype for each socket.  flowid
                     is a 32 bit hardware specific identifier for each flow.
                     flowtype defines which protocol fields are hashed to
                     produce the id.  A complete listing is available in
                     sys/mbuf.h under M_HASHTYPE_*.

             -S      Show network addresses as numbers (as with -n) but show
                     ports symbolically.

             -T      Display diagnostic information from the TCP control
                     block.  Fields include the number of packets requiring
                     retransmission, received out-of-order, and those
                     advertising a zero-sized window.

             -W      Avoid truncating addresses even if this causes some
                     fields to overflow.

             -x      Display socket buffer and TCP timer statistics for each
                     internet socket.

                     The -x flag causes netstat to output all the information
                     recorded about data stored in the socket buffers.  The
                     fields are:

                     R-MBUF        Number of mbufs in the receive queue.
                     S-MBUF        Number of mbufs in the send queue.
                     R-CLUS        Number of clusters, of any type, in the
                                   receive queue.
                     S-CLUS        Number of clusters, of any type, in the
                                   send queue.
                     R-HIWA        Receive buffer high water mark, in bytes.
                     S-HIWA        Send buffer high water mark, in bytes.
                     R-LOWA        Receive buffer low water mark, in bytes.
                     S-LOWA        Send buffer low water mark, in bytes.
                     R-BCNT        Receive buffer byte count.
                     S-BCNT        Send buffer byte count.
                     R-BMAX        Maximum bytes that can be used in the
                                   receive buffer.
                     S-BMAX        Maximum bytes that can be used in the send
                                   buffer.
                     rexmt         Time, in seconds, to fire Retransmit Timer,
                                   or 0 if not armed.

     netstat -i | -I interface [-46abdhnW] [-f address_family] [-M core]
             [-N system]
             Show the state of all network interfaces or a single interface
             which have been auto-configured (interfaces statically configured
             into a system, but not located at boot time are not shown).  An
             asterisk (“*”) after an interface name indicates that the
             interface is “down”.

             When netstat is invoked with -i (all interfaces) or -I interface,
             it provides a table of cumulative statistics regarding packets
             transferred, errors, and collisions.  The network addresses of
             the interface and the maximum transmission unit (“mtu”) are also
             displayed.

             -4      Show IPv4 only.  See GENERAL OPTIONS.

             -6      Show IPv6 only.  See GENERAL OPTIONS.

             -a      Multicast addresses currently in use are shown for each
                     Ethernet interface and for each IP interface address.
                     Multicast addresses are shown on separate lines following
                     the interface address with which they are associated.

             -b      Show the number of bytes in and out.

             -d      Show the number of dropped packets.

             -h      Print all counters in human readable form.

             -n      Do not resolve numeric addresses and port numbers to
                     names.  See GENERAL OPTIONS.

             -W      Avoid truncating interface names even if this causes some
                     fields to overflow.  GENERAL OPTIONS.

             -f protocol_family
                     Filter by protocol_family.  See GENERAL OPTIONS.

     netstat -w wait [-I interface] [-46d] [-M core] [-N system] [-q howmany]
             At intervals of wait seconds, display the information regarding
             packet traffic on all configured network interfaces or a single
             interface.

             When netstat is invoked with the -w option and a wait interval
             argument, it displays a running count of statistics related to
             network interfaces.  An obsolescent version of this option used a
             numeric parameter with no option, and is currently supported for
             backward compatibility.  By default, this display summarizes
             information for all interfaces.  Information for a specific
             interface may be displayed with the -I interface option.

             -I interface
                     Only show information regarding interface

             -4      Show IPv4 only.  See GENERAL OPTIONS.

             -6      Show IPv6 only.  See GENERAL OPTIONS.

             -M      Use an alternative core See GENERAL OPTIONS.

             -N      Use an alternative kernel image See GENERAL OPTIONS.

     netstat -B [-z] [-I interface]
             Show statistics about bpf(4) peers.  This includes information
             like how many packets have been matched, dropped and received by
             the bpf device, also information about current buffer sizes and
             device states.

             The bpf(4) flags displayed when netstat is invoked with the -B
             option represent the underlying parameters of the bpf peer.  Each
             flag is represented as a single lower case letter.  The mapping
             between the letters and flags in order of appearance are:

             p        Set if listening promiscuously
             i        BIOCIMMEDIATE has been set on the device
             f        BIOCGHDRCMPLT status: source link addresses are being
                      filled automatically
             s        BIOCGSEESENT status: see packets originating locally and
                      remotely on the interface.
             a        Packet reception generates a signal
             l        BIOCLOCK status: descriptor has been locked

             For more information about these flags, please refer to bpf(4).

             -z      Reset statistic counters after displaying them.

     netstat -r [-46AnW] [-F fibnum] [-f address_family] [-M core] [-N system]
             Display the contents of routing tables.

             When netstat is invoked with the routing table option -r, it
             lists the available routes and their status.  Each route consists
             of a destination host or network, and a gateway to use in
             forwarding packets.  The flags field shows a collection of
             information about the route stored as binary choices.  The
             individual flags are discussed in more detail in the route(8) and
             route(4) manual pages.  The mapping between letters and flags is:

             1        RTF_PROTO1           Protocol specific routing flag #1
             2        RTF_PROTO2           Protocol specific routing flag #2
             3        RTF_PROTO3           Protocol specific routing flag #3
             B        RTF_BLACKHOLE        Just discard pkts (during updates)
             b        RTF_BROADCAST        The route represents a broadcast
                                           address
             D        RTF_DYNAMIC          Created dynamically (by redirect)
             G        RTF_GATEWAY          Destination requires forwarding by
                                           intermediary
             H        RTF_HOST             Host entry (net otherwise)
             L        RTF_LLINFO           Valid protocol to link address
                                           translation
             M        RTF_MODIFIED         Modified dynamically (by redirect)
             R        RTF_REJECT           Host or net unreachable
             S        RTF_STATIC           Manually added
             U        RTF_UP               Route usable
             X        RTF_XRESOLVE         External daemon translates proto to
                                           link address

             Direct routes are created for each interface attached to the
             local host; the gateway field for such entries shows the address
             of the outgoing interface.  The refcnt field gives the current
             number of active uses of the route.  Connection oriented
             protocols normally hold on to a single route for the duration of
             a connection while connectionless protocols obtain a route while
             sending to the same destination.  The use field provides a count
             of the number of packets sent using that route.  The interface
             entry indicates the network interface utilized for the route.

             -4      Show IPv4 only.  See GENERAL OPTIONS.

             -6      Show IPv6 only.  See GENERAL OPTIONS.

             -n      Do not resolve numeric addresses and port numbers to
                     names.  See GENERAL OPTIONS.

             -W      Show the path MTU for each route, and print interface
                     names with a wider field size.

             -F      Display the routing table with the number fibnum.  If the
                     specified fibnum is -1 or -F is not specified, the
                     default routing table is displayed.

             -f      Display the routing table for a particular
                     address_family.

             -M      Use an alternative core See GENERAL OPTIONS.

             -N      Use an alternative kernel image See GENERAL OPTIONS.

     netstat -rs [-s] [-M core] [-N system]
             Display routing statistics.

             -s      If -s is repeated, counters with a value of zero are
                     suppressed.

             -M      Use an alternative core See GENERAL OPTIONS.

             -N      Use an alternative kernel image See GENERAL OPTIONS.

     netstat -g [-46W] [-f address_family] [-M core] [-N system]
             Display the contents of the multicast virtual interface tables,
             and multicast forwarding caches.  Entries in these tables will
             appear only when the kernel is actively forwarding multicast
             sessions.  This option is applicable only to the inet and inet6
             address families.

             -4      Show IPv4 only See GENERAL OPTIONS.

             -6      Show IPv6 only See GENERAL OPTIONS.

             -W      Avoid truncating addresses even if this causes some
                     fields to overflow.

             -f protocol_family
                     Filter by protocol_family.  See GENERAL OPTIONS.

             -M      Use an alternative core See GENERAL OPTIONS.

             -N      Use an alternative kernel image See GENERAL OPTIONS.

     netstat -gs [-46s] [-f address_family] [-M core] [-N system]
             Show multicast routing statistics.

             -4      Show IPv4 only See GENERAL OPTIONS.

             -6      Show IPv6 only See GENERAL OPTIONS.

             -s      If -s is repeated, counters with a value of zero are
                     suppressed.

             -f protocol_family
                     Filter by protocol_family.  See GENERAL OPTIONS.

             -M      Use an alternative core See GENERAL OPTIONS.

             -N      Use an alternative kernel image See GENERAL OPTIONS.

     netstat -Q
             Show netisr(9) statistics.  The flags field shows available ISR
             handlers:

             C        NETISR_SNP_FLAGS_M2CPUID           Able to map mbuf to
                                                         cpu id
             D        NETISR_SNP_FLAGS_DRAINEDCPU        Has queue drain
                                                         handler
             F        NETISR_SNP_FLAGS_M2FLOW            Able to map mbuf to
                                                         flow id

   GENERAL OPTIONS
     Some options have the general meaning:

     -4    Is shorthand for -f inet (Show only IPv4)

     -6    Is shorthand for -f inet6 (Show only IPv6)

     -f address_family, -p protocol
           Limit display to those records of the specified address_family or a
           single protocol.  The following address families and protocols are
           recognized:

           Family                               Protocols
           inet (AF_INET)                       divert, icmp, igmp, ip, ipsec,
                                                pim, sctp, tcp, udp
           inet6 (AF_INET6)                     icmp6, ip6, ipsec6, rip6,
                                                sctp, tcp, udp
           pfkey (PF_KEY)                       pfkey
           netgraph, ng (AF_NETGRAPH)           ctrl, data
           unix (AF_UNIX)
           link (AF_LINK)

           The program will complain if protocol is unknown or if there is no
           statistics routine for it.

     -M    Extract values associated with the name list from the specified
           core instead of the default /dev/kmem.

     -N    Extract the name list from the specified system instead of the
           default, which is the kernel image the system has booted from.

     -n    Show network addresses and ports as numbers.  Normally netstat
           attempts to resolve addresses and ports, and display them
           symbolically.

HISTORY
     The netstat command appeared in 4.2BSD.

     IPv6 support was added by WIDE/KAME project.

BUGS
     The notion of errors is ill-defined.
