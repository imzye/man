TZDIALOG(8)             FreeBSD System Manager's Manual            TZDIALOG(8)

NAME
     tzdialog – set local timezone

SYNOPSIS
     tzdialog [-enrsvX] [-C chroot_directory] [zoneinfo_file | zoneinfo_name]

DESCRIPTION
     The tzdialog utility reads a database of timezone information and
     presents a menu allowing the user to select a specific zone without
     knowing the details of the database layout.  The selected zone is
     installed as the system default zone.  The tzdialog utility also
     determines whether any adjustment is necessary for systems where the
     hardware clock does not keep UTC.

     The following option is available:

           -C chroot_directory
                       Open all files and directories relative to
                       chroot_directory.

           -n          Do not create or copy files.

           -r          Reinstall the zoneinfo file installed last time.  The
                       name is obtained from /var/db/zoneinfo.

           -s          Skip the initial question about adjusting the clock if
                       not set to UTC.

     It is possible to short-circuit the menu system by specifying the
     location of a zoneinfo_file or the name of the zoneinfo_name on the
     command line; this is intended mainly for pre-configured installation
     scripts or people who know which zoneinfo they want to install.

TIMEZONE DATABASE
     The contents of the timezone database are indexed by
     /usr/share/zoneinfo/zone.tab.  This file lists, for each timezone data
     file, the ISO 3166 territory code, approximate geographical coordinates
     (in ISO 6709 format), and location within the territory.

     The maintainers of the database maintain the following policies:

           1.   At least one zone for every country or inhabited geographical
                territory.

           2.   One zone for every distinct, documented timezone history since
                the beginning of the UNIX epoch (January 1, 1970, GMT).

           3.   Each zone is named for the most populous city therein.  (Where
                possible, the database includes pre-1970 history for its
                city.)

     The source code to the database (/usr/src/share/zoneinfo/[a-z]*) contains
     many additional comments and documentation references for the
     historically minded.

DEPENDENCIES
     The following standard commands are required by tzdialog:

     awk(1), cat(1), dialog(1), grep(1), id(1), ln(1), printf(1), rm(1),
     sort(1), strings(1), stty(1), uname(1), which(1)

     The following standard commands are optional, based on arguments passed
     and situation, but enhance the abilities of tzdialog:

     Xdialog(1)

FILES
     /etc/localtime                current time zone file
     /etc/wall_cmos_clock          see adjkerntz(8)
     /usr/share/misc/iso3166       mapping of ISO 3166 territory codes to
                                   names
     /usr/share/zoneinfo           directory for zoneinfo files
     /usr/share/zoneinfo/zone.tab  mapping of timezone file to country and
                                   location
     /var/db/zoneinfo              saved name of the timezone file installed
                                   last

EXAMPLES
     Normal usage, to select the right zoneinfo file via the dialog-based user
     interface:
           tzdialog

     Install the file /usr/share/zoneinfo/Australia/Sydney:
           tzdialog /usr/share/zoneinfo/Australia/Sydney

     Install the zoneinfo file for Australia/Sydney, assumed to be located in
     /usr/share/zoneinfo:
           tzdialog Australia/Sydney

     Reinstall last installed zoneinfo file (as specified in
     /var/db/zoneinfo):
           tzdialog -r

DISCLAIMER
     The representation of certain localities as being associated with certain
     countries and/or territories is for the purposes of identification only,
     and does not imply any endorsement or rejection on the part of the
     FreeBSD Project of the territorial claims of any entity.

BUGS
     Programs which are already running when tzdialog creates or updates
     /etc/localtime will not reflect the updated timezone.  When the system is
     first configured for a non-UTC hardware clock, it is necessary to run
     adjkerntz(8) (which normally happens as a part of system startup) in
     order to update the kernel's idea of the correct timezone offset.
