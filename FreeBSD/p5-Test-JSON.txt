NAME
       Test::JSON - Test JSON data

VERSION
       Version 0.11

SYNOPSIS
        use Test::JSON;

        is_valid_json $json,                 '... json is well formed';
        is_json       $json, $expected_json, '... and it matches what we expected';

EXPORT
       •   is_valid_json

       •   is_json

DESCRIPTION
       JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a lightweight data interchange
       format.  Test::JSON makes it easy to verify that you have built valid
       JSON and that it matches your expected output.

       See <http://www.json.org/> for more information.

TESTS
   is_valid_json
        is_valid_json $json, '... json is well formed';

       Test passes if the string passed is valid JSON.

   is_json
        is_json $json, $expected_json, '... and it matches what we expected';

       Test passes if the two JSON strings are valid JSON and evaluate to the
       same data structure.

       Test::Differences is used to provide easy diagnostics of why the JSON
       structures did not match.  For example:

          Failed test '... and identical JSON should match'
          in t/10testjson.t at line 14.
