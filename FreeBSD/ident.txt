IDENT(1)                FreeBSD General Commands Manual               IDENT(1)

NAME
     ident – identify RCS keyword string in files

SYNOPSIS
     ident [-q] [-V] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The ident utility searches for all instances of the pattern ‘$keyword:
     text$’ in files.

     If no arguments are passed, then ident parses the standard input.

     keyword must only be composed of alphanumeric values in the C locale,
     followed by ‘:’ and a space.

     These options are supported:

     -q   Quiet mode: suppress warnings if no pattern found.

     -V   Do nothing, added for compatibility with GNU ident.

EXIT STATUS
     The ident utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
