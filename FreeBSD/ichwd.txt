ICHWD(4)               FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual               ICHWD(4)

NAME
     ichwd – device driver for the Intel ICH watchdog interrupt timer

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following line in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device ichwd

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           ichwd_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The ichwd driver provides watchdog(4) support for the watchdog interrupt
     timer present on all Intel ICH motherboard chipsets.

     The ICH WDT counts down in ticks of approximately 0.6 seconds; the exact
     value depends on hardware quality and environmental factors.  Supported
     watchdog intervals range from 2 to 63 ticks.

     Note that on some ICH-based systems, the WDT may be present but disabled,
     either in hardware or by the BIOS.  The ichwd driver attempts to detect
     this condition and will refuse to attach if it believes the WDT is
     disabled.
