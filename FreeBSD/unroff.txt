NAME
       unroff-html-man - back-end to translate manual pages to HTML 2.0

SYNOPSIS
       unroff [ -fhtml ] [ -man ] [ file | option... ]

OVERVIEW
       When called with the -fhtml and -man options, the troff translator
       unroff loads the back-end for converting UNIX manual pages to the
       Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) version 2.0.

       Please read unroff(1) first for an overview of the Scheme-based,
       programmable troff translator and for a description of the generic
       options that exist in addition to -f and -m.  The translation of basic
       troff requests, special characters, escape sequences, etc. as well as
       the HTML-specific options are described in unroff-html(1).  For
       information about extending and programming unroff also refer to the
       Unroff Programmer's Manual.

OPTIONS
       The -man extension provides one new keyword/value option in addition to
       those listed in unroff(1) and unroff-html(1):

       do-signature (boolean)
              If set to 1, a signature is appended to each output file.  The
              signature is composed of a horizontal rule and a one-line
              message consisting of version information and date and time.
              The default value of this option is 1.

DESCRIPTION
       unroff reads and parses its input files (each containing a UNIX manual
       page); the HTML output is written to a separate output file for each
       input file.  The name of an output file is obtained by appending the
       suffix “.html” to the name of the corresponding input file.  Any
       document option is ignored if input files are named in the command
       line.  As usual, the special file name `-' can be used to interpolate
       standard input.

       If no file name is given in the command line, a manual page is read
       from standard input and sent to standard output, unless the document
       option is given, in which case the HTML output is written to the
       specified file (with “.html” appended).  Example: this call to unroff
       translates two manual pages and creates two corresponding output files,
       cc.1.html and send.2.html:

                  unroff -fhtml -man /usr/man/man1/cc.1 /usr/man/man2/send.2


       The following -man macros are recognized and translated (in addition to
       any user-defined macros):

               .TH     .SH     .SS     .I      .B      .SB     .SM
               .BI     .BR     .IB     .IR     .RB     .RI     .TP
               .IP     .HP     .RS     .RE     .LP     .PP     .P

       In addition, the following Sun-specific macros are silently ignored
       (.TX generates an informational message containing its argument):

               .TX     .IX     .DT     .PD     .UC

       The following predefined troff strings are recognized (\*S expands to
       the empty string):

               \*R     \*S     \*(lq   \*(rq

       The title of each HTML document generated is obtained by calling the
       primitive substitute (as explained in the Programmer's Manual) with the
       value of the option title and the first and second arguments passed to
       the initial call to .TH.  Thus, the specifiers “%1%” and “%2%” can be
       used in the option to interpolate the command (or whatever is
       documented in the manual page) and the section number.  If title has
       not been specified, the string “Manual page for %1%(%2%)” is taken.  As
       generating the HTML title element is deferred until the call to .TH,
       any macros or other troff requests that produce output must not be used
       before the initial .TH.

       HTML header elements <h2> and <h3> are created for .SH and .SS
       requests.  The markup created for the initial NAME section differs in
       that the contents of the section (usually a single line) is itself
       placed inside a header element.

       The font switching macros are based on changes to the fonts `R', `I',
       and `B', as explained under FONTS in unroff-html(1).  Of course, this
       fails if the fonts (which are mounted on startup) are unmounted by
       explicit .fp requests.  As HTML is lacking the concept of text size,
       the macro .SB is just an alias for .B, and .SM simply echoes its
       arguments.

       The translation rules for .TP and .IP employ a heuristic to determine
       whether to generate a definition list or an unordered list: if the
       first in a sequence of tagged/indented paragraph macros is called with
       a tag consisting of the special character \(bu, a definition list is
       begun, otherwise an unordered list.  Subsequent invocations cause the
       list style to change if appropriate.  Use of tagged paragraphs inside
       non-filled (pre-formatted) text violates the HTML definition and should
       be avoided.  A warning message is printed in this and other
       questionable situations.

       As hanging tags cannot be realized with HTML 2.0, a kludge is used for
       the .HP (hanging paragraph) macro: the macro starts a definition list
       (as does the ordinary .TP macro), and everything up to the next request
       that causes a break is placed inside the definition tag.  This method
       obviously fails if no break occurs in subsequent lines, but it works
       for the common, idiomatic use of hanging paragraphs in manual pages.
