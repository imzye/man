PKG-PROVIDES(8)         FreeBSD System Manager's Manual        PKG-PROVIDES(8)

NAME
     pkg provides – query which package provides a file matching a particular
     pattern

SYNOPSIS
     pkg provides [-u] [-f]
     pkg provides [-r repo] pattern

DESCRIPTION
     pkg provides is used to query which package in your pkg catalog provides
     a particular file given a pattern.

     The search pattern can be any perl compatible regular expression (PCRE).

OPTIONS
     The following options are supported by pkg provides:

     -u          Check if a new database file is available and then perform
                 the update.

     -f          Force the update.

     -r repo     Restrict search results to a specific repository.

     pattern     Can be any perl compatible regular expression (PCRE). The
                 search is not case sensitive.

ENVIRONMENT
     PROVIDES_FETCH_ON_UPDATE  If set to "NO", it disables the default
                               behaviour and doesn't perform a pkg provides
                               database update after updating pkg.

     PROVIDES_SRV              When set, overrides the default pkg provides
                               server address.  The default value is
                               "https://pkg-provides.osorio.me".

     PROVIDES_FILEPATH         When set, overrides the default database file
                               location in the remote server.  The filepath
                               format is the following :
                               v3/{osname}/{osver}:{arch}.  The default value
                               is "v3/FreeBSD/12:amd64" for a FreeBSD 12  and
                               "v3/DragonFly/6.2:x86:64" for a DragonFly 6.2.

     PROVIDES_URL              This environment variable is deprecated. Use
                               PROVIDES_SRV instead.

EXIT STATUS
     The pkg provides utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Update the provides database:

           $ pkg provides -u

     Search for a package that provides bin/firefox

           $ pkg provides bin/firefox$

     Search for packages that provide a file with the pattern libbz2.so.*

           $ pkg provides ^libbz2.so.

     Look for bin/firefox but only in the FreeBSD repository

           $ pkg provides -r FreeBSD bin/firefox$
