NAME
       libavcodec - media streams decoding and encoding library

DESCRIPTION
       The libavcodec library provides a generic encoding/decoding framework
       and contains multiple decoders and encoders for audio, video and
       subtitle streams, and several bitstream filters.

       The shared architecture provides various services ranging from bit
       stream I/O to DSP optimizations, and makes it suitable for implementing
       robust and fast codecs as well as for experimentation.
