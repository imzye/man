ANSI2KNR(1)             FreeBSD General Commands Manual            ANSI2KNR(1)



NAME
       ansi2knr - convert ANSI C to Kernighan & Ritchie C

SYNOPSIS
       ansi2knr [--filename filename] [input_file [output_file]]

DESCRIPTION
       --filename provides the file name for the #line directive in the
       output, overriding input_file (if present).

       If no input_file is supplied, input is read from stdin.

       If no output_file is supplied, output goes to stdout.

       There are no error messages.

       ansi2knr recognizes function definitions by seeing a non-keyword
       identifier at the left margin, followed by a left parenthesis, with a
       right parenthesis as the last character on the line, and with a left
       brace as the first token on the following line (ignoring possible
       intervening comments).  It will recognize a multi-line header provided
       that no intervening line ends with a left or right brace or a
       semicolon.  These algorithms ignore whitespace and comments, except
       that the function name must be the first thing on the line.

       ansi2knr also recognizes adjacent string literals and concatenates
       them.

       The following constructs will confuse it:
            - Any other construct that starts at the left margin and follows
       the above syntax (such as a macro or function call).
            - Some macros that tinker with the syntax of the function header.
            - String literals whose concatenation requires rewriting their
       contents; e.g. "ab " "07c" is concatenated to "ab 07c", which is not
       correct.

       The --varargs switch is obsolete, and is recognized only for backwards
       compatibility.  The present version of ansi2knr will always attempt to
       convert a ... argument to va_alist and va_dcl.

AUTHOR
       L. Peter Deutsch <ghost@aladdin.com> wrote the original ansi2knr and
       continues to maintain the current version; most of the code in the
       current version is his work.  ansi2knr also includes contributions by
       Francois Pinard <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>, Jim Avera <jima@netcom.com>,
       and Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com>.
