Rose::DBx::Object::MoreHelpers(3)          User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Rose::DBx::Object::MoreHelpers - more mixin helpers for RDBO

SYNOPSIS
        package MyRDBO;
        use base qw( Rose::DB::Object );
        use Rose::DBx::Object::MoreHelpers;

DESCRIPTION
       In the tradition of Rose::DB::Object::Helpers, more importable methods.

       This class inherits from Rose::Object::MixIn.  See the
       Rose::Object::MixIn documentation for a full explanation of how to
       import methods from this class.  The helper methods themselves are
       described below.

METHODS
       MoreHelpers changes the default relationship method makers to include:

        find
        get_set_on_save
        add_on_save
        count
        iterator

   primary_key_uri_escaped
       Returns the primary key value, URI-escaped. If there are multiple
       columns comprising the primary key, they are joined into a single
       string.

       If there are no values set for any of the column(s) comprising the
       primary key, returns 0.

       Otherwise, returns all column values joined with ";;" as per
       CatalystX::CRUD::Controller API.

   primary_key_value
       Returns the value of the primary key column(s). If the value is
       comprised of multiple column values, the return value will be an array
       ref of values.

   unique_value
       Returns the first single-column unique value from the object by
       default.  This is intended for the common case where you use a serial
       integer as the primary key but want to display a more human-friendly
       value programmatically, like a name.

       If no unique single-column values are found, returns the
       primary_key_value().

   moniker
       Returns the name of the class without any leading namespace qualifier.
       Similar to the DBIx::Class concept of 'moniker'.

   flatten( args )
       Returns the serialized object and its immediately related objects.

       As of version 0.03, this is just a wrapper around the as_tree() Helper
       method with the "force_load" arg set to true. args are passed directly
       to the as_tree() method.

       Requires RDBO 0.7712 or later.

   exists( [ @params ] )
       Returns true if the object exists in the database, false otherwise.

       May be called as class or object method.

       This method uses the Rose::DB::Object::Manager class to check the
       database based on non-unique column(s). Call it like you would
       load_speculative() but when you do not have a unique combination of
       columns (which all the load* methods require).

       When called as object method, if @params is omitted, the current column
       values of the object are used.

       Example:

        # 'title' has no unique constraints on it
        my $object = Object->new(title => 'Foo');
        $object->save unless $object->exists;

       NOTE: Using exists() as a way of enforcing data integrity is far
       inferior to actually placing a constraint on a table in the database.
       However, for things like testing and development data, it can be a
       useful utility method.

   has_related( relationship_name )
       Returns the number of related objects defined by the relationship_name
       accessor.

       Just a wrapper around the count RDBO method type.

   has_related_pages( relationship_name, page_size )
       Returns the number of "pages" given page_size for the count of related
       objects for relationship_name. Useful for creating pagers.

   fetch_all
       Shortcut for the Manager method get_objects().

   fetch_all_iterator
       Shortcut for the Manager method get_objects_iterator().

   fetch_count
       Shortcut for the Manager method get_objects_count().

   column_is_boolean( column_name )
       Returns true if the column type for column_name is 'boolean'.
