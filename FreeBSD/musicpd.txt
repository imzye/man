MUSICPD(1)                    Music Player Daemon                   MUSICPD(1)

NAME
       musicpd - MPD documentation

SYNOPSIS
       musicpd [options] [CONF_FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       MPD is a daemon for playing music. Music is played through the
       configured audio output(s) (which are generally local, but can be
       remote). The daemon stores info about all available music, and this
       info can be easily searched and retrieved. Player control, info
       retrieval, and playlist management can all be managed remotely.

       MPD searches for a config file in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mpd/mpd.conf then
       ~/.mpdconf then ~/.mpd/mpd.conf then /etc/mpd.conf or uses CONF_FILE.

       --systemd
              Used on Linux only so MPD can reliably detect whether it was
              started as a systemd service. Users shouldn't use this switch on
              the command line.
