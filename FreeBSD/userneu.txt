NAME
       userneu - A perl script to automatically create a batch of user
       accounts

SYNOPSIS
       userneu [ -dhrsy ] [ -i input file ] [ -g primary group ]
       [ -b [base directory for $HOME] ] [ -S [smbpasswd binary] ]
       [ -o [Output file] ] [ -m [minimum password length] ]
       [ -x [maximum password length] ] [  -D [descriptors] ]
       [ -G [member groups] ] [ -t [delimiter] ]

DESCRIPTION
       userneu processes a list of usernames and other information and creates
       user accounts based on that. The available command line options are:

       -d   Enable the "dupe engine" which tries to "bruteforce" a username
            that doesn't exist yet by appending one or two random characters
            to already existing usernames it encounters. This is disabled by
            default.

       -h   Display usage information.

       -r   Create strong passwords which means completely random strings of
            misc case letters, special characters and numbers with a length of
            10 characters (if no different length is specified using the -m
            and -x switches). By default this is disabled and the script
            creates passwords that are only composed of random lowercase
            letters with a length of 8 characters.

       -s   Create Samba accounts in addition to traditional unix accounts. By
            default this is disabled.

       -y   Append the "school year" to the GECOS field which is the period
            between some day in September and some day in July and is
            therefore composed of two calender years. I only included this
            because I originally wrote this script for creating user accounts
            on my school's network. If you need this option you probably know
            what I'm talking about, if not you can safely ignore this as it is
            disabled by default anyway.

       -i [input file]
            This option is only relevant if the script is called as userneu.
            It takes the location of the input file from which to read the
            user information as argument.

       -g [primary group]
            Specify the primary group for the users to be created, defaults to
            'users'.

       -G [member group1;member group2;...]
            Specify a semicolon separated list of member groups for the users
            to be created.

       -B [directory]
            Specify the directory where the home directories of the created
            users will be placed. Defaults to "/home/$group" where $group is
            the primary group of the users.

       -S [location of smbpasswd(8)]
            Specify the location of smbpasswd(8). Defaults to
            "/usr/local/bin/smbpasswd". This implies -s.

       -o [output file]
            Specify the location of the output file in which account
            information is stored. Defaults to 'useraccounts' CAUTION: This
            file contains cleartext passwords and should be well protected.
            Although the script changes it's mode to 0600 it is no good idea
            to keep it arround longer than needed.

       -m [minimum password length]
            Specify the minimum password length. This overrides the default
            value of 8 characters (no -r option given) or 10 characters (-r
            option given).

       -x [maximum passsword length]
            Specify the maximum password length. This overrides the default
            value of 8 characters (no -r option given) or 10 characters (-r
            option given).

       -D [descriptor1;descriptor2;...]
            Specify a semicolon separated list of descriptors for the fields
            in the input. The length of this list has to match the actual
            fields being present.

       -f [configuration file
            Specify the location of the configuration file. Defaults to
            /etc/userneu.conf.

       -t [delimiter]
            Specify the delimiter for the fields in the input file as perl
            regular expression (slash delimited). The default is "/\t/", which
            means the fields are separated by tabs. This is only relevant if
            the script is called as 'userneu'.
