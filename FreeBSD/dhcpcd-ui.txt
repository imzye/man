NAME
     dhcpcd-curses – a curses frontend for network configuration

DESCRIPTION
     dhcpcd-curses is a curses frontend for network configuration.  It uses
     dhcpcd(8) and wpa_supplicant(8) as backends.

     If dhcpcd-curses is used to make configuration changes then the user
     needs to be able to write to the privileged dhcpcd control socket.  See
     dhcpcd.conf(5) for details.

   wpa_supplicant
     dhcpcd-curses relies on wpa_supplicant(8) being configured to write its
     sockets to /var/run/wpa_supplicant. If dhcpcd-curses is used to select
     and set pass phrases for wireless networks then update_config=1 needs to
     be set in wpa_supplicant.conf.
