AACRAID(4)             FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual             AACRAID(4)

NAME
     aacraid – Adaptec AACRAID Controller driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device pci
           device aacraid

           To compile in debugging code:
           options AACRAID_DEBUG=N

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           aacraid_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The aacraid driver provides support for the Adaptec by PMC RAID
     controllers, including Series 6/7/8 and upcoming families.

     The RAID containers are handled via the aacraidp0 bus.  The physical
     buses are represented by the aacraidp? devices (beginning with
     aacraidp1).  These devices enable the SCSI pass-passthrough interface and
     allows devices connected to the card such as CD-ROMs to be available via
     the CAM scsi(4) subsystem.  Note that not all cards allow this interface
     to be enabled.

     The /dev/aacraid? device nodes provide access to the management interface
     of the controller.  One node exists per installed card.  If the kernel is
     compiled with the COMPAT_LINUX option, or the aacraid_linux.ko and
     linux.ko modules are loaded, the Linux-compatible ioctl(2) interface for
     the management device will be enabled and will allow Linux-based
     management applications to control the card.

HARDWARE
     Controllers supported by the aacraid driver include:

     •   Adaptec ASR-6405(T|E)
     •   Adaptec ASR-6445
     •   Adaptec ASR-6805(T|E|Q|TQ)
     •   Adaptec ASR-7085
     •   Adaptec ASR-7805(Q)
     •   Adaptec ASR-70165
     •   Adaptec ASR-71605(E|Q)
     •   Adaptec ASR-71685
     •   Adaptec ASR-72405
     •   Adaptec Series 8 cards

FILES
     /dev/aacraid?            aacraid management interface

DIAGNOSTICS
     Compiling with AACRAID_DEBUG set to a number between 0 and 3 will enable
     increasingly verbose debug messages.

     The adapter can send status and alert messages asynchronously to the
     driver.  These messages are printed on the system console, and are also
     queued for retrieval by a management application.

BUGS
     The controller is not actually paused on suspend/resume.
