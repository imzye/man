tcplog_dumper(1)        FreeBSD General Commands Manual       tcplog_dumper(1)

NAME
     tcplog_dumper – Gather the data from the tcp logs.

SYNOPSIS
     tcplog_dumper [-dhJ] [-D output-directory] [-f input-file] [-p pid-file]
                   [-u username]

DESCRIPTION
     The tcplog_dumper utility is designed pull data from the TCP log buffers.
     It then writes appropriate records to disk.  At present, it only supports
     the black box log records.

     The options are as follows:

     -D      Store the output files in output-directory.  Each record creates
             a separate file.  In addition, tcplog_dumper keeps a record of
             all the files it produces in a file named "records".  All of
             these files are stored in output-directory.

     -d      Daemonize the process.

     -f      Read the input from input-file.

     -h      Display the help message.

     -J      Compress the output using the XZ format.

     -p      Write the PID to pid-file.

     -u      After opening the input file, set the UID and GID to those of
             username.  (By default, the program will try to become user
             "nobody".)

     All the flags are optional.  To see the default values compiled into the
     program, use the -h option.

BUGS
     The syslog integration is not complete; hence, all the output comes to
     the controlling terminal.

     There are many places where the program simply crashes rather than try to
     recover from an error.  (However, these are not all bugs as there is no
     way to gracefully recover from a loss of synchronization with a stream of
     protocol data.)
