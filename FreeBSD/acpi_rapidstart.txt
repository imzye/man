ACPI_RAPIDSTART(4)     FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual     ACPI_RAPIDSTART(4)

NAME
     acpi_rapidstart – Intel rapid start technology ACPI driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following line in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device acpi_rapidstart

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           acpi_rapidstart_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The acpi_rapidstart driver provides support for Intel Rapid Start
     technology ACPI device interface.  Note that this is only for the ACPI
     device interface.  This has _CID PNP0C02 so it should be loaded at boot
     time to avoid attaching to the acpi_sysresource driver.

SYSCTLS
     The following sysctl(8) nodes are currently implemented:

     dev.acpi_rapidstart.0.ffs
             Rapid start flag.  It is a bitwise OR of the following:

             1           Enter Fast Flash Standby in RTC wake.
             2           Enter Fast Flash Standby in Critical Battery Wake
                         enable

     dev.acpi_rapidstart.0.ftv
             Fast Flash Standby timer value in minutes.
