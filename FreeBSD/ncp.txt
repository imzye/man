ncp(1)                  FreeBSD General Commands Manual                 ncp(1)

NAME
       ncp - copy files over TCP

SYNOPSIS
       ncp host files...

       ncp

DESCRIPTION
       ncp is used to copy files over a network.  It will open a TCP
       connection to the host given as argument 1 and then call tar to
       actually copy the files.  Calling ncp without arguments will invoke
       server mode, that is, it will sit there and wait for a connection from
       another ncp.

       ncp will tell tar to preserve file ownership and permissions, and tar
       will automatically copy directory trees recursively.

       ncp will use IPv6 if available.

       ncp uses TCP port 8002 for its connections.

BUGS
       ncp will call tar only after it has opened the connection.  If you
       forgot to specify any files or tried to send nonexistant files, tar
       will spew out error messages.  The peer will see no error messages!

       Not much error detection, error recovery or even decent error messages.
