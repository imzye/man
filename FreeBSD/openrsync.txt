               source ... directory

DESCRIPTION
     The openrsync utility synchronises files in the destination directory
     with one or more source files.  Either the source or the destination
     directory may be remote, but not both.  The arguments are as follows:

     -a, --archive
             Shorthand for -Dgloprt.

     --address=sourceaddr
             When connecting to an rsync daemon, use sourceaddr as the source
             address for connections, which is useful on machines with
             multiple interfaces.

     --compare-dest=directory
             Use directory as an alternate base directory to compare files
             against on the destination machine.  If file in directory is
             found and identical to the sender's file, the file will not be
             transferred.  Multiple --compare-dest directories may be
             provided.  If directory is a relative path, it is relative to the
             destination directory.

     --contimeout=seconds
             Set the connection timeout in seconds.  Exit if no connection
             established within the specified time.  The default is 0, which
             means no timeout.

     -D      Also transfer device and special files.  Shorthand for --devices
             --specials.

     --del, --delete
             Delete files in directory not found in source directories.  Only
             applicable with -r.

     -e program, --rsh=program
             Specify alternative communication program, defaults to ssh(1).

     --exclude pattern
             Exclude files matching pattern.

     --exclude-from=file
             Load patterns and rules from file.

     --devices
             Also transfer device files.

     -g, --group
             Set the group name to match the source.  For example, group
             "kristaps" with ID 1000 on a remote server is matched to group
             "kristaps" on the local machine with ID 2000.  If --numeric-ids
             is also given or if the remote group name is unknown on the local
             machine, set the numeric group ID to match the source instead.

     -I, --ignore-times
             Do not skip based on file size and modification time.

     --include pattern
             Include files matching pattern.

     --include-from=file
             Load patterns and rules from file.

     -J, --omit-link-times
             Don't set symlink modification times to match the source.

     -l, --links
             Also transfer symbolic links.  The link is transferred as a
             standalone file: if the destination does not exist, it will be
             broken.

     --max-size size
             Don't transfer any file that is larger than size bytes.
             Alternatively size may instead use a multiplier, as documented in
             scan_scaled(3), to specify the size.

     --min-size size
             Don't transfer any file that is smaller than size bytes.  See
             --max-size on the definition of size.

     -n, --dry-run
             Do not actually modify the destination.  Mainly useful in
             combination with -v.

     --no-motd
             Do not display the Message of the Day.

     --numeric-ids
             Ignore user and group names, use numeric user and group IDs only.
             Has no effect unless -g or -o is also given.

     -O, --omit-dir-times
             Don't set directory modification times to match the source.

     -o, --owner
             Set the user name to match the source, with similar matching
             logic as for -g.  If --numeric-ids is also given or if the remote
             user name is unknown on the local machine, set the numeric user
             ID to match the source instead.  Only works if run as root.

     -p, --perms
             Set destination file or directory permissions to match the source
             when it is updated.

     --port=service
             Specify an alternative TCP port number.  The service can be given
             as a decimal integer or as a name to be looked up in the
             services(5) database.  The default is “rsync”.

     -r, --recursive
             If source designates a directory, synchronise the directory and
             the entire subtree connected at that point.  If source ends with
             a slash, only the subtree is synchronised, not the source
             directory itself.  If source is a file, this has no effect.

     --rsync-path=program
             Run program on the remote host instead of the default rsync.

     --size-only
             Skip files based only on size, don't check timestamp.

     --specials
             Also transfer fifo and unix domain socket files.

     --timeout=seconds
             Set the I/O timeout in seconds.  Exit if no data was transferred
             for the specified time.  The default is 0, which means no
             timeout.

     -t, --times
             Set destination file and directory modification time to match the
             source when it is updated or created.

     -V, --version
             Print version and exit.

     -v, --verbose
             Increase verbosity.  Specify once for files being transferred,
             twice for specific status, thrice for per-file transfer
             information, and four times for per-file breakdowns.

     -x      Do not cross filesystem boundaries.  If this option is repeated,
             all mount point directories from the copy are omitted.
             Otherwise, it includes an empty directory at each mount point it
             encounters.

     A remote source or directory has the syntax host:path for connecting via
     ssh(1), or rsync://host/path or host::path for connecting to a remote
     daemon.  Subsequent to the first remote source, the host may be dropped
     to become just :path or ::path.

     For connecting to a remote daemon with rsync://host or host::path, the
     first path component is interpreted as a "module": host::module/path.
     This only applies to the first source invocation; subsequent to that, the
     module should not be specified.

     By default, new destination files and directories are given the current
     time and the source file permissions.  Updated files retain their
     existing permissions.  It is an error if updated files have their file
     types change (e.g., updating a directory with a file).

     At this time, source may only consist of regular files, directories (only
     with -r), or symbolic links (only with -l).  The destination directory
     must be a directory and is created if not found.

EXIT STATUS
     The openrsync utility exits 0 on success, 1 if an error occurs, or 2 if
     the remote protocol version is older than the local protocol version.

EXAMPLES
     A common invocation of openrsync is for archiving from a remote host to
     the local computer:

           % openrsync -av --delete remote:rpath /local/path

     This will update the contents of /local/path/rpath with those on the
     remote server.  Switching remote and local wil update the remote contents
     instead:

           % openrsync -av --delete /local/path remote:rpath

     All examples use -t so that destination files inherit the source time.
     If not changed, subsequent invocations of openrsync will then consider
     the file up to date and not transfer block hashes.

     To update the out-of-date remote files host:dest/bar and host:dest/baz
     with the local ../src/bar and ../src/baz:

           % openrsync -t ../src/bar ../src/baz host:dest

     To update the out-of-date local files bar and baz with the remote files
     host:src/bar and host:src/baz:

           % openrsync -t host:src/bar :src/baz .

     To update the out-of-date local files ../dest/bar and ../dest/baz with
     bar and baz:

           % openrsync -t bar baz ../dest

     To update the out-of-date remote files in host:dest on a remote host
     running openrsync with the local host running rsync(1):

           % rsync --rsync-path openrsync -t ../dest/* host:dest
