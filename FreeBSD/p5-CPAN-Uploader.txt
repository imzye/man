NAME
       cpan-upload - upload a distribution to the CPAN

VERSION
       version 0.103013

USAGE
         usage: cpan-upload [options] file-to-upload-1 [ file-to-upload-2 ... ]
           -v --verbose       enable verbose logging
           -h --help          display this help message
           --dry-run          do not actually upload anything

           -u --user          your PAUSE username
           -p --password      the password to your PAUSE account
           -d --directory     a dir in your CPAN space in which to put the file
           --http-proxy       URL of the http proxy to use in uploading
           --ignore-errors    instead of aborting, continue to next file on error
           -c --config        config file to use; defaults to ~/.pause
           --md5              compute MD5 checksums of the files

CONFIGURATION
       If you have a ".pause" file in your home directory, it will be checked
       for a username and password.  It should look like this:

         user EXAMPLE
         password your-secret-password

       You can GnuPG-encrypt this file if you wish, but you must install
       Config::Identity and configure your gpg-agent as Config::Identity
       currently doesn't prompt for a password at decryption time:

           # Follow the prompts, setting your key as the "recipient"
           # Use ^D once you've finished typing out your authentication information
           gpg -ea > $HOME/.pause
           # OR, encrypt a file you already created:
           gpg -ea $HOME/.pause && mv $HOME/.pause{.asc,}
