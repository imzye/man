Cat(3)                User Contributed Perl Documentation               Cat(3)


NAME
       File::Cat - Perl implementation of cat(1)

SYNOPSIS
         use File::Cat;

         cat ('/etc/motd', \*STDOUT)
               or die "Can't cat /etc/motd: $!";

DESCRIPTION
       File::Cat is a module of adventure, danger, and low cunning. With it,
       you will explore some of the most inane programs ever seen by mortals.
       No computer should be without one!

FUNCTIONS
       •   cat EXPR, FILEHANDLE

           Copies data from EXPR to FILEHANDLE, or returns false if an error
           occurred.  EXPR can be either an open readable filehandle or a
           filename to use as input.

       •   cattail EXPR, FILEHANDLE

           Prints EXPR to FILEHANDLE -- backwards, line by line -- or returns
           false if an error occurred. Again, EXPR can be either a filehandle
           or a filename.
