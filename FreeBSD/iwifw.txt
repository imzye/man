NAME
     iwifw – Firmware Module for Intel PRO/Wireless 2200BG/2225BG/2915ABG
     driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this module into the kernel, place the following line in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device iwifw

     This will include three firmware images inside the kernel.  If you want
     to pick only the firmware image for the mode you want to operate your
     network adapter in choose one of the following:

           device iwibssfw
           device iwiibssfw
           device iwimonitorfw

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following lines in loader.conf(5):

           iwi_bss_load="YES"
           iwi_ibss_load="YES"
           iwi_monitor_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     This module provides access to firmware sets for the Intel PRO/Wireless
     2200BG/2225BG/2915ABG series of IEEE 802.11 adapters.  It may be
     statically linked into the kernel, or loaded as a module.

     For the loaded firmware to be enabled for use the license at
     /usr/share/doc/legal/intel_iwi.LICENSE must be agreed to by adding the
     following line to loader.conf(5):
