MINIGZIP(1)             FreeBSD General Commands Manual            MINIGZIP(1)

NAME
     minigzip – minimal implementation of the 'gzip' compression tool

SYNOPSIS
     minigzip [-cd] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The minigzip utility is a minimal implementation of the gzip(1) utility.
     It supports compression and decompression of individual files, as well as
     streaming compression and decompression via standard input and output.

     The default operation is compression, decompression can be selected by
     supplying the -d flag on the command line.

     If any file arguments are supplied, the operation is performed on each
     file separately.  Compression replaces the original file with one having
     a .gz suffix.  Decompression will remove a .gz suffix if one is present.

     If no file arguments are supplied, minigzip reads from standard input and
     writes the results of the operation to standard output.

     If the -c option is specified, minigzip writes the results to standard
     output and keep the original files unchanged.
