Color::Palette(3)     User Contributed Perl Documentation    Color::Palette(3)


NAME
       Color::Palette - a set of named colors

VERSION
       version 0.100004

DESCRIPTION
       The libraries in the Color-Palette distribution are meant to make it
       easy to build sets of named colors, and to write applications that can
       define and validate the color names they required.

       For example, a color palette might contain the following data:

         highlights => #f0f000
         background => #333
         sidebarBackground => #88d
         sidebarText       => 'highlights'
         sidebarBoder      => 'sidebarText'

       Colors can be defined by a color specifier (a Graphics::Color object, a
       CSS-style hex triple, or an arrayref of RGB values) or by a name of
       another color that appears in the palette.  If colors are defined in
       terms of another color that doesn't exist, an exception will be raised.

       Applications that wish to use color palettes can provide schemas that
       define the names they expect to be present in a palette.  These schemas
       are Color::Palette::Schema objects.

       A palette can be checked against a schema with the schema's "check"
       method, or may be reduced to the minimal set of colors needed to
       satisfy the schema with the palette's "optimized_for" method.

PERL VERSION
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It
       should work on any version of perl released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made
       that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version
       may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

ATTRIBUTES
   colors
       This attribute is a hashref.  Keys are color names and values are
       either Color objects or names of other colors.  To get at the color
       object for a name consult the "color" method.

METHODS
   color
         my $color_obj = $palette->color('extremeHighlight');

       This method will return the Color object to be used for the given name.

   color_names
         my @names = $palette->color_names;

       This method returns a list of all color names the object knows about.

   as_css_hash
         my $triple_for = $palette->as_css_hash

       This method returns a hashref.  Every color name known to the palette
       has an entry, and the value is the CSS-safe hex string for the resolved
       color.  For example, the output for the color scheme in the
       "DESCRIPTION" section would be:

         {
           highlights => '#f0f000',
           background => '#333333',
           sidebarBackground => #8888dd',
           sidebarText       => #f0f000',
           sidebarBoder      => #f0f000',
         }

   as_strict_css_hash
         my $hashref = $palette->as_strict_css_hash;

       This method behaves just like "as_css_hash", but the returned hashref
       is tied so that trying to read values for keys that do not exist is
       fatal.  The hash may also become read-only in the future.

   optimized_for
         my $optimized_palette = $palette->optimized_for($schema);

       This method returns a new palette containing only the colors needed to
       fulfill the requirements of the given schema.  This is useful for
       reducing a large palette to the small set that must be embedded in a
       document.

       "optimize_for" redispatches to this method for historical reasons.
