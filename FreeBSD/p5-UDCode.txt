NAME
       UDCode - Does a set of code words form a uniquely decodable code?

SYNOPSIS
               use UDCode;

               if (is_udcode(@words)) { ... }

               my ($x1, $x2) = ud_pair(@words);

DESCRIPTION
       A code is a set of strings, called the code words.  A code is "uniquely
       decodable" if any string S that is a concatenation of code words is so
       in exactly one way.

       For example, the code "ab", "abba", "b" is not uniquely decodable,
       because "abba" . "b" eq "ab" . "b" . "ab".  But the code "a", "ab",
       "abb" is uniquely decodable, because there is no such pair of sequences
       of code words.

   "is_udcode"
       is_udcode(@words) returns true if and only if the specified code is
       uniquely decodable.

   "ud_pair"
       If @words is not a uniquely decodable code, then ud_pair(@words)
       returns a proof of that fact, in the form of two distinct sequences of
       code words whose concatenations are equal.

       If @words is not uniquely decodable, then "ud_pair" returns references
       to two arrays of code words, $a, and $b, such that:

               join("", @$a) eq join("", @$b)

       For example, given "@words = qw(ab abba b)", "ud_pair" might return the
       two arrays "["ab", "b", "ab"]" and "["abba", "b"]".

       If @words is uniquely decodable, "ud_pair" returns false.
