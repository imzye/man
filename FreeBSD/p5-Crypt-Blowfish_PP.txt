NAME
       Crypt::Blowfish_PP - Blowfish encryption algorithm implemented purely
       in Perl

SYNOPSIS
       "use Crypt::Blowfish_PP";

       $blowfish=new Crypt::Blowfish_PP($key);

       $ciphertextBlock=$blowfish->encrypt($plaintextBlock);

       $plaintextBlock=$blowfish->decrypt($ciphertextBlock);

DESCRIPTION
       The Crypt::Blowfish_PP module provides for users to use the Blowfish
       encryption algorithm in perl. The implementation is entirely Object
       Oriented, as there is quite a lot of context inherent in making
       blowfish as fast as it is. The key is anywhere between 64 and 448 bits
       (8 and 56 bytes), and should be passed as a packed string. The
       transformation itself is a 16-round Feistel Network, and operates on a
       64 bit block.

       Object methods for the Crypt::Blowfish_PP module:

   new(key)
       The new() method initialises a blowfish object with the key that is
       passed.  This is the slow part of doing a blowfish encryption or
       decryption, as it initialises the 18 p-boxes and the 1024 s-boxes that
       are used for the algorithm.  It will return undef if the key is not of
       a valid length.

   encrypt(block)
       The encrypt() method uses the initialised blowfish object to encrypt 8
       bytes of data of the string passed to it. It returns the encrypted
       block.

   decrypt(block)
       The decrypt() method uses the initialised blowfish object to decrypt 8
       bytes of data of the string passed to it. It returns the decrypted
       block.

COMMENTS
       This is probably crap software, but hey, its for general use. I'm happy
       to patch it with other people's code... :)

       If you want speed, then see the Crypt::Blowfish module.
