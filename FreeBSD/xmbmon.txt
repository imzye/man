mbmon(1)                FreeBSD General Commands Manual               mbmon(1)

NAME
       mbmon - MotherBoard Monitor

SYNOPSIS
       mbmon [options] <seconds for sleep> (default 5 sec)

       This manual page documents briefly the mbmon command.  This manual page
       was written for the Debian distribution because the original program
       does not have a manual page.

       Recent motherboards have functionalities to monitor the CPU
       temperatures and the frequency of CPU cooling fans etc.  Although some
       programs utilizing these hardware monitoring facilities have been
       developed for the Microsoft Windows platforms, no programs seem to
       exist for PC-UNIX and the X Windows System platforms.

       mbmon used at the command line reports the temperatures, voltages and
       rpm (rounds per minute) of cooling fans. It can also be used remotly
       via telnet, thanks to the "-P" option.
