ULED(4)                FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                ULED(4)

NAME
     uled – USB LED driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines into
     your kernel configuration file:

           device uled
           device usb

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           uled_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The uled driver provides support for Dream Cheeky WebMail Notifier and
     ThingM blink(1) notification LED.

     Subsequently, the /dev/uled0 device can be used by userland applications.

IOCTLS
     The following ioctl(2) commands can be performed on /dev/uled0, which are
     defined in <dev/usb/uled_ioctl.h>:

     ULED_GET_COLOR
             The command returns LED colors with values for RGB.  This
             ioctl(2) takes the following structure:

             struct uled_color {
                     uint8_t red;
                     uint8_t green;
                     uint8_t blue;
             };

     ULED_SET_COLOR
             The command sets LED colors with values for RGB.  It uses the
             same structure as above.

FILES
     /dev/uled0      blocking device node
