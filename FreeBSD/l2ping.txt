L2PING(8)               FreeBSD System Manager's Manual              L2PING(8)

NAME
     l2ping – send L2CAP ECHO_REQUEST to remote devices

SYNOPSIS
     l2ping [-fhn] -a remote [-c count] [-i wait] [-S source] [-s size]

DESCRIPTION
     The l2ping utility uses L2CAP ECHO_REQUEST datagram to elicit an L2CAP
     ECHO_RESPONSE datagram from a remote device.

     The options are as follows:

     -a remote
             Specify the remote device to ping.  The remote device can be
             specified by either its BD_ADDR or name.  If name was specified
             then the l2ping utility will attempt to resolve the name via
             bt_gethostbyname(3).

     -c count
             Number of packets to send.  If this option is not specified,
             l2ping will operate until interrupted.

     -f      Do not wait between sending each packet.

     -h      Display usage message and exit.

     -i wait
             Wait wait seconds between sending each packet.  The default is to
             wait for one second between each packet.  This option is ignored
             if -f has been specified.

     -n      Numeric output only.  No attempt will be made to look up symbolic
             names for host addresses.

     -S source
             Specify the local device which should be used to send L2CAP
             ECHO_REQUEST datagrams.  The local device can be specified by
             either its BD_ADDR or name.  If name was specified then the
             l2ping utility will attempt to resolve the name via
             bt_gethostbyname(3).

     -s size
             Specify the number of payload bytes to be sent.  The default size
             is 44 bytes.  It is calculated as minimum L2CAP MTU (48 bytes)
             minus the size of the L2CAP signalling command header (4 bytes).
             The maximum size is 65531 bytes.  Is is calculated as maximum
             L2CAP MTU (65535 bytes) minus four bytes of payload reserved for
             l2ping internal use.  Use this option with caution.  Some
             implementations may not like large sizes and may hang or even
             crash.

EXIT STATUS
     The l2ping utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

BUGS
     Could collect more statistic.  Could check for duplicated, corrupted and
     lost packets.
