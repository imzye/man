NAME
       turbo - An experimental text editor based on Scintilla and Turbo
       Vision.

SYNOPSIS
       turbo [file...]

DESCRIPTION
       Turbo is an experimental text editor for the terminal, based on the
       Scintilla code editing component and the Turbo Vision application
       framework.

       It was created to demonstrate new features in Turbo Vision.  In
       particular, it has served as testing ground for Turbo Vision's Unicode
       capabilities.

       As a text editor, Turbo aims at being intuitive and easy to use.  And
       simply because it is a Turbo Vision application, it offers a vintage
       look and feel.

ENVIRONMENT
       The following environment variables affect the behaviour of Turbo:

       COLUMNS, LINES
              Overrides the system-supplied number of terminal columns and
              columns.

       DISPLAY, WAYLAND_DISPLAY
              Turbo will interact with the X11 or Wayland clipboard if
              available.  This requires wl-clipboard and xsel or xclip to be
              installed.

       LANG, LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE
              UTF-8 support is only enabled if a UTF-8 locale is in use.

NOTES
       Not all keyboard shortcuts are supported by all terminals.  For this
       reason, some commands can be triggered by more than one shortcut.
