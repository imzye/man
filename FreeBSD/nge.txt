NAME
     nge – National Semiconductor PCI Gigabit Ethernet adapter driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device miibus
           device nge

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_nge_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The nge driver provides support for various NICs based on the National
     Semiconductor DP83820 and DP83821 Gigabit Ethernet controller chips.

     The DP83820 supports TBI (ten bit interface) and GMII transceivers, which
     means it can be used with either copper or 1000baseX fiber applications.
     The DP83820 supports TCP/IP checksum offload and VLAN tagging/insertion
     as well as a 2048-bit multicast hash filter and up to 4 pattern match
     buffers.

     Most cards also use the DP83861 10/100/1000 copper gigabit transceiver
     chip, which supports autonegotiation of 10, 100 and 1000Mbps modes in
     full or half duplex.

     The DP83820 and DP83821 also support jumbo frames, which can be
     configured via the interface MTU setting.  Selecting an MTU larger than
     1500 bytes with the ifconfig(8) utility configures the adapter to receive
     and transmit jumbo frames.  Using jumbo frames can greatly improve
     performance for certain tasks, such as file transfers and data streaming.

     The nge driver supports the following media types:

     autoselect   Enable autoselection of the media type and options.  The
                  user can manually override the autoselected mode by adding
                  media options to rc.conf(5).

     10baseT/UTP  Set 10Mbps operation.  The ifconfig(8) mediaopt option can
                  also be used to select either full-duplex or half-duplex
                  modes.

     100baseTX    Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.  The ifconfig(8)
                  mediaopt option can also be used to select either
                  full-duplex or half-duplex modes.

     1000baseTX   Set 1000baseTX operation over twisted pair.  full-duplex and
                  half-duplex modes are supported.

     1000baseSX   Set 1000Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) operation.  Both full-duplex
                  and half-duplex modes are supported.

     The nge driver supports the following media options:

     full-duplex  Force full duplex operation.

     half-duplex  Force half duplex operation.

     For more information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

HARDWARE
     The nge driver supports National Semiconductor DP83820 and DP83821 based
     Gigabit Ethernet adapters including:

     •   Addtron AEG320T
     •   Ark PC SOHO-GA2500T (32-bit PCI) and SOHO-GA2000T (64-bit PCI)
     •   Asante FriendlyNet GigaNIX 1000TA and 1000TPC
     •   D-Link DGE-500T
     •   Linksys EG1032, revision 1
     •   Netgear GA621
     •   Netgear GA622T
     •   SMC EZ Card 1000 (SMC9462TX)
     •   Surecom Technology EP-320G-TX
     •   Trendware TEG-PCITX (32-bit PCI) and TEG-PCITX2 (64-bit PCI)

SYSCTL VARIABLES
     The following variables are available as both sysctl(8) variables and
     loader(8) tunables:

     dev.nge.%d.int_holdoff
             Maximum amount of time to delay interrupt processing in units of
             100us.  The accepted range is 0 to 255, the default is 1(100us).
             Value 0 completely disables the interrupt moderation.  The
             interface has to be brought down and up again before a change
             takes effect.

DIAGNOSTICS
     nge%d: couldn't map memory  A fatal initialization error has occurred.

     nge%d: couldn't map ports  A fatal initialization error has occurred.

     nge%d: couldn't map interrupt  A fatal initialization error has occurred.

     nge%d: no memory for softc struct!  The driver failed to allocate memory
     for per-device instance information during initialization.

     nge%d: failed to enable memory mapping!  The driver failed to initialize
     PCI shared memory mapping.  This might happen if the card is not in a
     bus-master slot.

     nge%d: no memory for jumbo buffers!  The driver failed to allocate memory
     for jumbo frames during initialization.

     nge%d: watchdog timeout  The device has stopped responding to the
     network, or there is a problem with the network connection (cable).
