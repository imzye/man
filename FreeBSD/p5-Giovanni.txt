CONFIG
       To configure a project to use Giovanni simply put a `.giovanni.conf`
       file in the root directory of your project and run `gio deploy`. The
       syntax of the config for timestamped rollouts looks like this:

           [project "PROJECT"]
               hosts    = HOST, IP
               root     = /usr/local/PROJECT
               init     = /etc/init.d/START_STOP_SCRIPT
               deploy   = update_cache, rollout_timestamped, restart_phased, cleanup_timestamped, notify
               rollback = rollback_timestamped, restart_phased, notify
               repo     = git://github.com/PROJECT.git
               cache    = /tmp/repo_cache/
               user     = DEPLOY USER
               jabber_user = USER@jabber.org
               jabber_pass = PASS
               jabber_to = ROOM@conference.jabber.org

       The config for a deployment into the git checkout directory looks like
       this:

           [project "PROJECT"]
               hosts    = HOST, IP
               root     = /var/www/PROJECTNAME
               init     = /etc/init.d/START_STOP_SCRIPT
               deploy   = update_cache, rollout, restart, cleanup_timestamped, notify
               rollback = rollback, restart, notify
               repo     = git://github.com/PROJECT.git
               user     = DEPLOY USER
               jabber_user = USER@jabber.org
               jabber_pass = PASS
               jabber_to = ROOM@conference.jabber.org
