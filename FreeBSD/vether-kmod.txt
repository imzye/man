VETHER(4)              FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual              VETHER(4)

NAME
     vether – virtual Ethernet interface

SYNOPSIS
     pseudo-device vether

DESCRIPTION
     The vether interface simulates a normal Ethernet interface by
     encapsulating standard network frames with an Ethernet header,
     specifically for use as a member in a bridge(4).

     To use vether the administrator needs to configure an address onto the
     interface so that packets can be routed to it.  An Ethernet header will
     be prepended and, if the vether interface is a member of a bridge(4), the
     frame will show up there.
