NAME
       ample - Ample MP3 server

SYNOPSIS
       ample [OPTION] [PATH...]


DESCRIPTION
       ample Ample is an MP3 server that allows you to listen to your music
       that can be stored locally or remotely. It does not intend to support
       mixing, radio shows etc. It's just an easy way to listen to your MP3's
       everywhere using the "open location" features already present in XMMS,
       WinAmp and Media Player.  After installing, configuring and starting
       ample, try connecting to http://server:1234/ with the "open location"
       feature of your favourite MP3 player or http://server:1234/index.html
       with your favourite web browser.

       [PATH...]
              These are path(s) to files or directories that Ample can use to
              populate it's list of MP3's. If PATH is a directory, all files
              (possibly recursively, see the -n option above) will be added.
              If PATH is a regular file ending with .mp3 it will be added and
              if it is a regular file ending with .m3u (MP3 playlist) the
              files listed in it will be added.


FILES
       /usr/local/etc/ample.conf
              The default config file (another file may be used, see the -f
              option above). See ample.conf(5) for further details.

       /usr/local/etc/ample.html
              The default HTML template file (another file may be used, see
              the -m option above). See ample.html(5) for further details.
