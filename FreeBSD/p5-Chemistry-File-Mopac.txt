NAME
       Chemistry::File::Mopac - MOPAC 6 input file reader/writer

SYNOPSIS
           use Chemistry::File::Mopac;

           # read a MOPAC file
           my $mol = Chemistry::Mol->read('file.mop');

           # write a MOPAC file using cartesian coordinates
           $mol->write('file.mop', coords => 'cartesian');

           # now with internal coordinates
           $mol->write('file.mop', coords => 'internal');

           # rebuild the Z-matrix from scratch while we are at it
           $mol->write('file.mop', rebuild => 1);

DESCRIPTION
       This module reads and writes MOPAC 6 input files. It can handle both
       internal coordinates and cartesian coordinates. It also extracts
       molecules from summary files, defined as those files that match
       /SUMMARY OF/ in the third line.  Perhaps a future version will extract
       additional information such as the energy and dipole from the summary
       file.

       This module registers the "mop" format with Chemistry::Mol. For
       detection purposes, it assumes that filenames ending in .mop or .zt
       have the Mopac format, as well as files whose first line matches
       /am1|pm3|mndo|mdg|pdg/i (this may change in the future).

       When the module reads an input file into $mol, it puts the keywords
       (usually the first line of the file) in $mol->attr("mopac/keywords"),
       the comments (usually everything else on the first three lines) in
       $mol->attr("mopac/comments") and $mol->name, and the internal
       coordinates for each atom in $atom->internal_coords.

       When writing, the kind of coordinates used depend on the "coords"
       option, as shown in the SYNOPSIS. Internal coordinates are used by
       default. If the molecule has no internal coordinates defined or the
       rebuild option is set, the build_zmat function from
       Chemistry::InternalCoords::Builder is used to renumber the atoms and
       build the Z-matrix from scratch.

TO DO
       When writing a Mopac file, this version marks all coordinates as
       variable (for the purpose of geometry optimization by Mopac). A future
       version should have more flexibility.
