NAME
       povray - POV-Ray: The Persistence of Vision Ray Tracer


SYNOPSIS
       povray [+Ooutput_file] [+/-option ...] [input_file]

       povray [+Iinput_file] [+Ooutput_file] [+/-option ...] [INI_file]


DESCRIPTION
       POV-Ray is a free, full-featured ray tracer, written and maintained by
       a team of volunteers on the Internet.  On the UNIX platform POV-Ray can
       be compiled with support for preview capabilities using the X Window
       System.  Under Linux, POV-Ray can optionally use the SVGA library to
       preview renderings.

       This manual page only lists the basic POV-Ray and UNIX specific
       features and command-line options for this version of POV-Ray.  For a
       complete description of the features of POV-Ray and its scene
       description language (a.k.a. POV-Ray SDL), or for a better explanation
       of the meaning of the command-line and INI file options, please consult
       the documentation that should accompany all versions of POV-Ray.  The
       documentation is installed in PREFIX/share/doc/povray-3.6, where PREFIX
       is /usr/local by default, or a path specified when configuring the
       source package for compilation and installation.

       Some of the UNIX-specific features are:

              Support for X Window display automatically uses the best visual
              class and deepest depth available.  For visuals that do not
              support 24 bits of color per pixel, Floyd-Steinberg error
              diffusion dithering is used, along with a dynamically allocated
              and optimized palette to produce the best display possible with
              the current visual, depth, and available colormap.

              ICCCM compliance for the X Window version means that the preview
              window will behave like standard X Window programs, communicate
              properly with the window manager, and will accept the standard
              command-line options.  See X(1) for more information.

              Support for SVGAlib display automatically detects the available
              SVGA display modes to choose the size which best fits the
              rendered image.  When rendering an image that is too large for
              the current display, the displayed image is scaled to fit on the
              screen.  For displays that do not support true-color modes,
              Floyd-Steinberg dithering is used.

              ASCII graphics in the text-mode version allow a basic view of
              the current rendering on text-only terminals.

              An interrupt handler allows rendering to be interrupted in a
              safe way, so that any data not currently written to disk will be
              saved before exiting.  Control-C or SIGINT will cause a user
              abort, and save the current rendering, before exiting.  See
              kill(1) for more information.

              Platform and architecture-independent rendering means that the
              same scene will render in the same way on all computers and
              operating systems (with the exception of the rendering speed, of
              course).


OPTIONS
       Options can be specified with either a leading '+' or a leading '-'.
       Many options are switches, meaning a '+' turns the option on, and a '-'
       turns the option off.  For other options, it doesn't matter if a '+' or
       a '-' is used.  Most options cannot have spaces in them so you should
       specify +FN rather than +F N, and combining options is not allowed, so
       +SC is very different from +S +C.  Options are not case sensitive.

       The command-line options are shown below with their corresponding INI
       file options.  If the same option is specified multiple times, whether
       in INI files or on the command-line, the last such option overrides any
       previous ones, with the exception of the +L or Library_Path option,
       which is cumulative.


   Help options:
       The help screen is divided into several parts. To access one part just
       enter the number of the screen after the -? option or the -help option.
       For instance, use -?5 or -help5 to see the help screen about the
       tracing options.

       ?[01234567] or help[01234567]
              Display help on command-line options for section 0 through 7.
              Note that most shells will treat the ? as a shell globbing
              character unless it is escaped. The available sections are:

   Parsing options:
       I<input_file_name> or Input_File_Name=file
              Specifies the input file to use.  If the input file name is '-',
              the scene description will be read from the standard input.  The

       HI<header_include_file_name> or Include_Header=file
              Specifies a file as the first include file of a scene file.
              This can be used to always include a specific set of default
              include files used by all your scenes.

       L<library_path> or Library_Path=path
              Specifies a directory to search for input files, include files,
              fonts, and image maps, if the specified file is not in the
              current directory.  This may be specified multiple times to
              increase the number of directories to search.

       MVn.n or Version=float
              Treat scene files as if they were version n.n instead of the
              current version.  This may be overridden from within the scene
              file.

       SU or Split_Unions=bool
              Split bounded CSG unions if children are finite.  This allows
              automatic bounding of CSG objects to take place.

       UR or Remove_Bounds=bool
              Remove unnecessary bounding objects.  This allows automatic
              bounding of older scene files to take place.


   Output options:
       Hn or Height=integer
              The image should be n pixels high.

       Wn or Width=integer
              The image should be n pixels wide.

       SRn or Start_Row=integer
              Start the rendering at row n from the top of the screen.

       SR0.n or Start_Row=float
              Start the rendering n percent from the top of the screen.

       ERn or End_Row=integer
              End the rendering at row n from the top of the screen.

       ER0.n or End_Row=float
              End the rendering at n percent from the top of the screen.

       SCn or Start_Column=integer
              Start the rendering at column n from the left of the screen.

       SC0.n or Start_Column=float
              Start the rendering at n percent from the left of the screen.

       ECn or Start_Column=integer
              End the rendering at column n from the left of the screen.

       EC0.n or Start_Column=float
              End the rendering at n percent from the left of the screen.

       C or Continue_Trace=bool
              Continue a previously interrupted trace.

       P or Pause_When_Done=bool
              If previewing, pause when the rendering is complete before
              closing the window.

       V or Verbose=bool
              Output verbose status messages on the progress of the rendering.

       WLn or Warning_Level=integer
              Set warning level to n.

       X or Test_Abort=bool
              Enable the 'q' and 'Q' keys to interrupt a rendering in
              progress.

       Xn or Test_Abort_Count=integer
              Only check every n pixels for a user abort.


   Output options - display related:
       D[0][GHT] or Display=bool  Palette=char
              Display the rendering in progress, optionally specifying the
              palette.  The only valid X Window palette option is G, which
              forces grayscale preview.  The X Window palette is based on the
              visual used, whether selected automatically by POV-Ray or via
              the -visual option.  SVGA options are T for 24-bit true-color,
              and H for 15-bit high-color display, in addition to the default
              256-color palette.  To specify the palette, you must first
              specify the display type (the second character, shown here as
              '0') for compatibility reasons, even though it is ignored in
              UNIX versions.

       SPn or Preview_Start_Size=integer
              Start mosaic preview with blocks n pixels square.

       EPn or Preview_End_Size=integer
              End mosaic preview with blocks n pixels square.

       UD or Draw_Vistas=bool
              Draw vista rectangles before rendering.


   Output options - file related:
       Bn or Buffer_Output=bool Buffer_Size=integer
              Use an output buffer n kilobytes in size.

       F[CNPT][n] or Output_to_File=bool Output_File_Type=char
              Store the rendered image using one of the available formats,
              namely Compressed TGA, PNG, PPM, and TGA.  PNG format supports
              the n option to specify the number of bits per color, where 5 <=
              n <= 16.  The default is 8.

       O<output_file> or Output_File_Name=file
              Write the output to the file named output_file, or the standard
              output if '-' is given as the output file name.

       HT[CNPTX] or Histogram_Type=char
              Create a CPU utilization histogram image in format x.  Available
              formats are Comma-separated values (CSV), PNG grayscale, PPM POV
              heightfield, uncompressed TGA POV heightfield, or X for no
              histogram generation.

       HN<histogram_file_name> or Histogram_Name=file
              Output the histogram to the specified file.

   Tracing options:
       MBn or Bounding=bool Bounding_Threshold=integer
              Use automatic bounding slabs if more than n objects are in the
              scene.

       Qn or Quality=integer
              Render at quality n.  Qualities range from 0 for rough images
              and 9 for complete ray-tracing and textures, and 10 and 11 add
              radiosity.

       A0.n or Antialias=bool Antialias_Threshold=integer
              Do antialiasing on the pixels until the difference between
              adjacent pixels is less that 0.n, or the maximum recursion depth
              is reached.

       AMn or Sampling_Method=integer
              Specify the method of antialiasing used, non-adaptive (n = 1),
              or adaptive antialiasing (n = 2).

       Jn.n or Jitter=bool Jitter_Amount=float
              Specify maximum radius, in pixels, that antialiased samples
              should be jittered from their true centers.

       Rn or Antialias_Depth=integer
              Set the maximum recursion depth for antialiased pixel
              sub-sampling.

       UA or Output_Alpha=bool
              Use alpha channel for transparency mask.

              Use vista buffer to speed up rendering.


   Animation options:
       Kn.n or Clock=float
              Render a single frame of an animation with the clock value n.n.

       KFIn or Initial_Frame=integer
              Specify the initial frame number for an animation.

       KFFn or Final_Frame=integer
              Specify the final frame number for an animation.  This must be
              set at a value other that 1 in order to render multiple frames
              at once.

       KIn.n or Initial_Clock=float
              Specify the clock value for the initial frame of an animation.

       KFn.n or Final_Clock=float
              Specify the clock value for the frame final of an animation.

       SFn or Subset_Start_Frame=integer
              Render a subset of frames from an animation, starting at frame
              n.

       SF0.n or Subset_Start_Frame=float
              Render a subset of frames from an animation, starting n percent
              into the animation.

       EFn or Subset_End_Frame=integer
              Render a subset of frames from an animation, stopping at frame
              n.

       EF0.n or Subset_End_Frame=float
              Render a subset of frames from an animation, stopping n percent
              into the animation.

       KC or Cyclic_Animation=bool
              Generate clock values for a cyclic animation.

       UF or Field_Render=bool
              Render alternate frames using odd/even fields, suitable for
              interlaced output.

       UO or Odd_Field=bool
              Start a field rendered animation on the odd field, rather than
              the even field.


   Redirecting options:
       GI<name> or Create_Ini=bool or Create_Ini=file
              Write all INI parameters to a file named after the input scene
              file, or one with the specified name.

       G[ADFRSW]<name> or <Stream>_File=bool or <Stream>_File=file
              Write the stream to the console and/or the specified file.  The

              Render_File, Statistics_File, and the Warning_File.


   X Window System options:
       In addition to the standard command-line options, POV-Ray recognizes
       additional command-line switches related to the X Window System.  See
       X(1) for a complete description of these options.

       -display <display_name>
              Display preview on display_name rather than the default display.
              This is meant to be used to change the display to a remote host.
              The normal dispay option +d is still valid.

       -geometry  [WIDTHxHEIGHT][+XOFF+YOFF]
              Render the image with WIDTH and HEIGHT as the dimensions, and
              locate the window XOFF from the left edge, and YOFF from the top
              edge of the screen (or if negative the right and bottom edges
              respectively).  The WIDTH and HEIGHT, if given, override any
              previous Wn and Hn settings.

       -help  Display the X Window System-specific options.  Use -H by itself
              on the command-line to output the general POV-Ray options.

       -icon  Start the preview window as an icon.

       -title <window_title>
              Override the default preview window title with window_title.

       -visual <visual_type>
              Use the deepest visual of visual_type, if available, instead of
              the automatically selected visual.  Valid visuals are
              StaticGray, GrayScale, StaticColor, PseudoColor, TrueColor, or
              DirectColor.


RESOURCES
       Currently no X resource or app-default files are supported for the X
       Window options.


FILES
       POV-Ray for UNIX allows a povray.ini file in the current directory to
       override the individual setting in $HOME/.povray/3.6/povray.ini.
       POV-Ray looks for initial configuration information, like the
       Library_Path settings, which gives the location for the standard
       include files, first in the environment variable $POVINI, then in
       ./povray.ini, then in $HOME/.povray/3.6/povray.ini, then in
       PREFIX/etc/povray/3.6/povray.ini. The PREFIX directory can be changed
       at compile-time using the --prefix option of the configure script.  For
       backward compatibility with POV-Ray version 3.5 and earlier, the
       $HOME/.povrayrc and $PREFIX/etc/povray.ini files are also searched for
       when none of the above files were found.

       Since version 3.5 POV-Ray features an I/O Restriction mechanism.  I/O
       Restrictions attempt to at least partially protect a machine running
       POV-Ray from having files read or written outside of a given set of
       directories. The settings are defined in two configuration files, a
       system-level PREFIX/etc/povray/3.6/povray.conf file and an user-level
       $HOME/.povray/3.6/povray.conf file with more restrictive settings.  In
       POV-Ray 3.6 the format of these configuration files has changed, and no
       backward compatibility is retained with the configuration files in POV-
       Ray 3.5. See the documentation for further details and examples of I/O
       Restriction settings.

       povlegal.doc should accompany all installations of POV-Ray, and
       outlines specific conditions and restrictions on the POV-Ray software.
       A condition of povlegal.doc requires that documentation, INI and scene
       files be available to all users of POV-Ray. Scene and INI files are
       typically installed in PREFIX/share/povray-3.6, and documentation in
       PREFIX/share/doc/povray-3.6, but these may be in other locations on
       some systems.

       The most recent version of POV-Ray and its documentation can always be
       retrieved via anonymous FTP at ftp.povray.org or via HTTP at
       www.povray.org, as well as many other locations.

BUGS
       The SVGA version does not currently generate an optimized grayscale
       palette for grayscale preview, so displays using the G palette option
       will use very few gray levels, and a few non-gray colors.

       Before reporting a bug to the authors, you should make sure you have
       the latest version of the software, in case the bug has already been
       fixed.  There are a large number of POV-Ray users on the POV-Ray
       newsserver news.povray.org (a list of available groups can be found on
       www.povray.org/resources/newsgroups).  Try to find help and assistance
       in there before contacting the authors.

       If you have a repeatable bug in the most recent version, try to isolate
       the bug in the smallest scene file possible.  The POV-Ray Team
       Co-ordinator is Chris Cason, and can be reached at team-
       coord-36@povray.org. Do not send large binary or uuencoded files to
       Chris without first asking permission to do so.
