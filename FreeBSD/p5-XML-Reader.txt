NAME
       XML::Reader - Reading XML and providing path information based on a
       pull-parser.

SYNOPSIS
         use XML::Reader qw(XML::Parser);

         my $text = q{<init>n <?test pi?> t<page node="400">m <!-- remark --> r</page></init>};

         my $rdr = XML::Reader->new(\$text);
         while ($rdr->iterate) {
             printf "Path: %-19s, Value: %s\n", $rdr->path, $rdr->value;
         }

       This program produces the following output:

         Path: /init              , Value: n t
         Path: /init/page/@node   , Value: 400
         Path: /init/page         , Value: m r
         Path: /init              , Value:

       You can also wrap the call to XML::Reader->new(...) into an eval {...}
       to check if it succeeded, as follows:

         my $rdr = eval{ XML::Reader->new('test.xml') }
           or warn "Can't XML::Reader->new() because $@";

         if ($rdr) {
             # ... do something with $rdr ...
         }
         else {
             # ... do some error handling ...
         }

USAGE
       Normally, you don't use XML::Reader directly, you use either
       XML::Reader::RS (which uses XML::Parser) or you use XML::Reader::PP
       (which uses XML::Parsepp).

       However, if you use XML::Reader directly, here is how you switch
       between XML::Parser and XML::Parsepp:

       If no parser is given in the "use" statement, XML::Reader tries to load
       XML::Parser.  That works very well, except for cases where people don't
       have a C-compiler available to install XML::Parser.  If loading
       XML::Parser fails, the module falls back to loading XML::Parsepp.

       It is also possible to explicitly select the parser. In the example
       below, XML::Parser is chosen explicitly, so compilation will fail if
       that module isn't available.

         use XML::Reader qw(XML::Parser);

         my $text = q{<init>n <?test pi?> t<page node="400">m <!-- remark --> r</page></init>};

         my $rdr = XML::Reader->new(\$text);
         while ($rdr->iterate) {
             printf "Path: %-19s, Value: %s\n", $rdr->path, $rdr->value;
         }

       The only thing to remember is that XML::Reader has dependencies on both
       XML::Parser and XML::Parsepp, which means that if you can't (for
       whatever reason) install XML::Parser, you can still install
       XML::Reader, you just don't run the tests.

DESCRIPTION
       XML::Reader provides a simple and easy to use interface for
       sequentially parsing XML files (so called "pull-mode" parsing) and at
       the same time keeps track of the complete XML-path.

       It was developped as a wrapper on top of XML::Parser or XML::Parsepp
       (while, at the same time, some basic functions have been copied from
       XML::TokeParser). all modules, XML::Parser, XML::Parsepp and
       XML::TokeParser allow pull-mode parsing, but do not keep track of the
       complete XML-Path. Also, the interfaces to XML::Parser, XML::Parsepp
       and XML::TokeParser require you to distinguish between start-tags, end-
       tags and text on seperate lines, which, in my view, complicates the
       interface (although, XML::Reader allows option {filter => 4, mode =>
       'pyx'} which emulates start-tags, end-tags and text on separate lines,
       if that's what you want).

       There is also XML::TiePYX, which lets you pull-mode parse XML-Files
       (see <http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2000/03/15/feature/index.html> for an
       introduction to PYX).  But still, with XML::TiePYX you need to account
       for start-tags, end-tags and text, and it does not provide the full
       XML-path.

       By contrast, XML::Reader translates start-tags, end-tags and text into
       XPath-like expressions. So you don't need to worry about tags, you just
       get a path and a value, and that's it. (However, should you wish to
       operate XML::Reader in a PYX compatible mode, there is option {filter
       => 4, mode => 'pyx'}, as mentioned above, which allows you to parse XML
       in that way).

       But going back to the normal mode of operation, here is an example XML
       in variable '$line1':

         my $line1 =
         q{<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
           <data>
             <item>abc</item>
             <item><!-- c1 -->
               <dummy/>
               fgh
               <inner name="ttt" id="fff">
                 ooo <!-- c2 --> ppp
               </inner>
             </item>
           </data>
         };

       This example can be parsed with XML::Reader using the methods "iterate"
       to iterate one-by-one through the XML-data, "path" and "value" to
       extract the current XML-path and its value.

       You can also keep track of the start- and end-tags: There is a method
       "is_start", which returns 1 or 0, depending on whether the XML-file had
       a start tag at the current position. There is also the equivalent
       method "is_end".

       There are also the methods "tag", "attr", "type" and "level". "tag"
       gives you the current tag-name, "attr" returns the attribute-name,
       "type" returns either 'T' for text or '@' for attributes and "level"
       indicates the current nesting-level (a number >= 0).

       Here is a sample program which parses the XML in '$line1' from above to
       demonstrate the principle...

         use XML::Reader qw(XML::Parser);

         my $rdr = XML::Reader->new(\$line1);
         my $i = 0;
         while ($rdr->iterate) { $i++;
             printf "%3d. pat=%-22s, val=%-9s, s=%-1s, e=%-1s, tag=%-6s, atr=%-6s, t=%-1s, lvl=%2d\n", $i,
               $rdr->path, $rdr->value, $rdr->is_start, $rdr->is_end, $rdr->tag, $rdr->attr, $rdr->type, $rdr->level;
         }

       ...and here is the output:

          1. pat=/data                 , val=         , s=1, e=0, tag=data  , atr=      , t=T, lvl= 1
          2. pat=/data/item            , val=abc      , s=1, e=1, tag=item  , atr=      , t=T, lvl= 2
          3. pat=/data                 , val=         , s=0, e=0, tag=data  , atr=      , t=T, lvl= 1
          4. pat=/data/item            , val=         , s=1, e=0, tag=item  , atr=      , t=T, lvl= 2
          5. pat=/data/item/dummy      , val=         , s=1, e=1, tag=dummy , atr=      , t=T, lvl= 3
          6. pat=/data/item            , val=fgh      , s=0, e=0, tag=item  , atr=      , t=T, lvl= 2
          7. pat=/data/item/inner/@id  , val=fff      , s=0, e=0, tag=@id   , atr=id    , t=@, lvl= 4
          8. pat=/data/item/inner/@name, val=ttt      , s=0, e=0, tag=@name , atr=name  , t=@, lvl= 4
          9. pat=/data/item/inner      , val=ooo ppp  , s=1, e=1, tag=inner , atr=      , t=T, lvl= 3
         10. pat=/data/item            , val=         , s=0, e=1, tag=item  , atr=      , t=T, lvl= 2
         11. pat=/data                 , val=         , s=0, e=1, tag=data  , atr=      , t=T, lvl= 1

INTERFACE
   Object creation
       To create an XML::Reader object, the following syntax is used:

         my $rdr = XML::Reader->new($data,
           {strip => 1, filter => 2, using => ['/path1', '/path2']});

       The element $data (which is mandatory) is the name of the XML-file, or
       a URL that starts with 'http://...', or a reference to a string, in
       which case the content of that string is taken as the text of the XML.

       Alternatively, $data can also be a previously opened filehandle, such
       as \*STDIN, in which case that filehandle is used to read the XML.

       Here is an example to create an XML::Reader object with a file-name:

         my $rdr = XML::Reader->new('input.xml');

       Here is another example to create an XML::Reader object with a
       reference:

         my $rdr = XML::Reader->new(\'<data>abc</data>');

       Here is an example to create an XML::Reader object with an open
       filehandle:

         open my $fh, '<', 'input.xml' or die "Error: $!";
         my $rdr = XML::Reader->new($fh);

       Here is an example to create an XML::Reader object with \*STDIN:

         my $rdr = XML::Reader->new(\*STDIN);

       One or more of the following options can be added as a hash-reference:

       option {parse_ct => }
           Option {parse_ct => 1} allows for comments to be parsed, default is
           {parse_ct => 0}

       option {parse_pi => }
           Option {parse_pi => 1} allows for processing-instructions and XML-
           Declarations to be parsed, default is {parse_pi => 0}

       option {using => }
           Option {using => } allows for selecting a sub-tree of the XML.

           The syntax is {using => ['/path1/path2/path3',
           '/path4/path5/path6']}

       option {filter => } and {mode => }
           Option {filter => 2} or {mode => 'attr-bef-start'} shows all lines,
           including attributes.

           Option {filter => 3} or {mode => 'attr-in-hash'} removes attribute
           lines (i.e. it removes lines where $rdr->type eq '@').  Instead, it
           returns the attributes in a hash $rdr->att_hash.

           Option {filter => 4} or {mode => 'pyx'} breaks down each line into
           its individual start-tags, end-tags, attributes, comments and
           processing-instructions.  This allows the parsing of XML into pyx-
           formatted lines.

           Option {filter => 5} or {mode => 'branches'} selects only data for
           a given root. The elements for each root are collected in an array
           reference (as specified by the branch) and returned when the root
           is complete. This processing lies half way between option using
           (where all elements are returned one by one) and the function
           slurp_xml (where all elements are collected in a branch, and all
           branches are collected in an in-memory structure).

           The syntax is {filter => 2|3|4|5, mode =>
           'attr-bef-start'|'attr-in-hash'|'pyx'|'branches'}, default is
           {filter => 2, mode => 'attr-bef-start'}

       option {strip => }
           Option {strip => 1} strips all leading and trailing spaces from
           text and comments.  (attributes are never stripped). {strip => 0}
           leaves text and comments unmodified.

           The syntax is {strip => 0|1}, default is {strip => 1}

       option {dupatt => }
           Option {dupatt => '*'} allows for duplicate attributes to be read.
           Multiple attributes are then concatenated by '*'.

   Methods
       A successfully created object of type XML::Reader provides the
       following methods:

       iterate
           Reads one single XML-value. It returns 1 after a successful read,
           or undef when it hits end-of-file.

       path
           Provides the complete path of the currently selected value,
           attributes are represented by leading '@'-signs.

       value
           Provides the actual value (i.e. the value of the current text or
           attribute).

           Note that, when {filter => 2 or 3} and in case of an XML
           declaration (i.e. $rdr->is_decl == 1), you want to suppress any
           value (which would be empty anyway). A typical code fragment would
           be:

             print $rdr->value, "\n" unless $rdr->is_decl;

           The above code does *not* apply for {filter => 4}, in which case a
           simple "print $rdr->value;" suffices:

             print $rdr->value, "\n";

       comment
           Provides the comment of the XML. You should check if
           $rdr->is_comment is true before accessing the comment.

       type
           Provides the type of the value: 'T' for text, '@' for attributes.

           If option {filter => 4} is in effect, then the type can be: 'T' for
           text, '@' for attributes, 'S' for start tags, 'E' for end-tags, '#'
           for comments, 'D' for the XML Declaration, '?' for processing-
           instructions.

       tag Provides the current tag-name.

       attr
           Provides the current attribute name (returns the empty string for
           non-attribute lines).

       level
           Indicates the nesting level of the XPath expression (numeric value
           greater than zero).

       prefix
           Shows the prefix which has been removed in option {using => ...}.
           Returns the empty string if option {using => ...} has not been
           specified.

       att_hash
           Returns a reference to a hash with the current attributes of a
           start-tag (or empty hash if it is not a start-tag).

       dec_hash
           Returns a reference to a hash with the current attributes of an
           XML-Declaration (or empty hash if it is not an XML-Declaration).

       proc_tgt
           Returns the target (i.e. the first part) of a processing-
           instruction (or an empty string if the current event is not a
           processing-instruction).

       proc_data
           Returns the data (i.e. the second part) of a processing-instruction
           (or an empty string if the current event is not a processing-
           instruction).

       pyx Returns the pyx string of the current XML-event.

           The pyx string is a string that starts with a specific first
           character. That first character of each line of PYX tells you what
           type of event you are dealing with: if the first character is '(',
           then you are dealing with a start event. If it's a ')', then you
           are dealing with and end event. If it's an 'A' then you are dealing
           with attributes. If it's '-', then you are dealing with text. If
           it's '?', then you are dealing with processing-instructions. (see
           <http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2000/03/15/feature/index.html> for an
           introduction to PYX).

           The method "pyx" makes sense only if option {filter => 4} is
           selected, for any filter other than 4, undef is returned.

       is_start
           Returns 1 if the XML-file had a start tag at the current position,
           otherwise 0 is returned.

       is_end
           Returns 1 if the XML-file had an end tag at the current position,
           otherwise 0 is returned.

       is_decl
           Returns 1 if the XML-file had an XML-Declaration at the current
           position, otherwise 0 is returned.

       is_proc
           Returns 1 if the XML-file had a processing-instruction at the
           current position, otherwise 0 is returned.

       is_comment
           Returns 1 if the XML-file had a comment at the current position,
           otherwise 0 is returned.

       is_text
           Returns 1 if the XML-file had text at the current position,
           otherwise 0 is returned.

       is_attr
           Returns 1 if the XML-file had an attribute at the current position,
           otherwise 0 is returned.

       is_value
           Returns 1 if the XML-file has either a text or an attribute at the
           current position, otherwise 0 is returned. This is mostly useful in
           {filter => 4, mode => 'pyx'} to see whether the method value() can
           be used.

       rx  This is the index of the currently selected branch (only useful
           when {filter => 5, mode => 'branches'} was set).

       rvalue
           This is a reference to either a scalar or to an array of the
           currently selected branch (only useful when {filter => 5, mode =>
           'branches'} was set). rvalue is a faster, but not so convenient
           version of value (with rvalue you will have to do the dereferencing
           yourself).

       rstem
           This is function is a duplicate of the existing function path.

OPTION USING
       Option {using => ...} allows for selecting a sub-tree of the XML.

       Here is how it works in detail...

       option {using => ['/path1/path2/path3', '/path4/path5/path6']}
       eliminates all lines which do not start with '/path1/path2/path3' (or
       with '/path4/path5/path6', for that matter). This effectively leaves
       only lines starting with '/path1/path2/path3' or '/path4/path5/path6'.

       Those lines (which are not eliminated) will have a shorter path by
       effectively removing the prefix '/path1/path2/path3' (or
       '/path4/path5/path6') from the path. The removed prefix, however, shows
       up in the prefix-method.

       '/path1/path2/path3' (or '/path4/path5/path6') are supposed to be
       absolute and complete, i.e.  absolute meaning they have to start with a
       '/'-character and complete meaning that the last item in path 'path3'
       (or 'path6', for that matter) will be completed internally by a
       trailing '/'-character.

   Example with using
       The following program takes this XML and parses it with XML::Reader,
       including the option 'using' to target specific elements:

         use XML::Reader qw(XML::Parser);

         my $line2 = q{
         <data>
           <order>
             <database>
               <customer name="aaa" />
               <customer name="bbb" />
               <customer name="ccc" />
               <customer name="ddd" />
             </database>
           </order>
           <dummy value="ttt">test</dummy>
           <supplier>hhh</supplier>
           <supplier>iii</supplier>
           <supplier>jjj</supplier>
         </data>
         };

         my $rdr = XML::Reader->new(\$line2,
           {using => ['/data/order/database/customer', '/data/supplier']});

         my $i = 0;
         while ($rdr->iterate) { $i++;
             printf "%3d. prf=%-29s, pat=%-7s, val=%-3s, tag=%-6s, t=%-1s, lvl=%2d\n",
               $i, $rdr->prefix, $rdr->path, $rdr->value, $rdr->tag, $rdr->type, $rdr->level;
         }

       This is the output of that program:

          1. prf=/data/order/database/customer, pat=/@name , val=aaa, tag=@name , t=@, lvl= 1
          2. prf=/data/order/database/customer, pat=/      , val=   , tag=      , t=T, lvl= 0
          3. prf=/data/order/database/customer, pat=/@name , val=bbb, tag=@name , t=@, lvl= 1
          4. prf=/data/order/database/customer, pat=/      , val=   , tag=      , t=T, lvl= 0
          5. prf=/data/order/database/customer, pat=/@name , val=ccc, tag=@name , t=@, lvl= 1
          6. prf=/data/order/database/customer, pat=/      , val=   , tag=      , t=T, lvl= 0

   Example without using
       The following program takes the same XML and parses it with
       XML::Reader, but without the option 'using'.

         use XML::Reader qw(XML::Parser);

         my $rdr = XML::Reader->new(\$line2);
         my $i = 0;
         while ($rdr->iterate) { $i++;
             printf "%3d. prf=%-1s, pat=%-37s, val=%-6s, tag=%-11s, t=%-1s, lvl=%2d\n",
              $i, $rdr->prefix, $rdr->path, $rdr->value, $rdr->tag, $rdr->type, $rdr->level;
         }

       As you can see in the following output, there are many more lines
       written, the prefix is empty and the path is much longer than in the
       previous program:

          1. prf= , pat=/data                                , val=      , tag=data       , t=T, lvl= 1

OPTION PARSE_CT
       Option {parse_ct => 1} allows for comments to be parsed (usually,
       comments are ignored by XML::Reader, that is {parse_ct => 0} is the
       default.

       Here is an example where comments are ignored by default:

         use XML::Reader qw(XML::Parser);

         my $text = q{<?xml version="1.0"?><dummy>xyz <!-- remark --> stu <?ab cde?> test</dummy>};

         my $rdr = XML::Reader->new(\$text);

         while ($rdr->iterate) {
             if ($rdr->is_decl)    { my %h = %{$rdr->dec_hash};
                                     print "Found decl     ",  join('', map{" $_='$h{$_}'"} sort keys %h), "\n"; }
             if ($rdr->is_proc)    { print "Found proc      ", "t=", $rdr->proc_tgt, ", d=", $rdr->proc_data, "\n"; }
             if ($rdr->is_comment) { print "Found comment   ", $rdr->comment, "\n"; }
             print "Text '", $rdr->value, "'\n" unless $rdr->is_decl;
         }

       Here is the output:

         Text 'xyz stu test'

       Now, the very same XML data, and the same algorithm, except for the
       option {parse_ct => 1}, which is now activated:

         use XML::Reader qw(XML::Parser);

         my $text = q{<?xml version="1.0"?><dummy>xyz <!-- remark --> stu <?ab cde?> test</dummy>};

         my $rdr = XML::Reader->new(\$text, {parse_ct => 1});

         while ($rdr->iterate) {
             if ($rdr->is_decl)    { my %h = %{$rdr->dec_hash};
                                     print "Found decl     ",  join('', map{" $_='$h{$_}'"} sort keys %h), "\n"; }
             if ($rdr->is_proc)    { print "Found proc      ", "t=", $rdr->proc_tgt, ", d=", $rdr->proc_data, "\n"; }
             if ($rdr->is_comment) { print "Found comment   ", $rdr->comment, "\n"; }
             print "Text '", $rdr->value, "'\n" unless $rdr->is_decl;
         }

       Here is the output:

         Text 'xyz'
         Found comment   remark
         Text 'stu test'

OPTION PARSE_PI
       Option {parse_pi => 1} allows for processing-instructions and XML-
       Declarations to be parsed (usually, processing-instructions and XML-
       Declarations are ignored by XML::Reader, that is {parse_pi => 0} is the
       default.

       As an example, we use the very same XML data, and the same algorithm
       from the above paragraph, except for the option {parse_pi => 1}, which
       is now activated (together with option {parse_ct => 1}):

         use XML::Reader qw(XML::Parser);

         my $text = q{<?xml version="1.0"?><dummy>xyz <!-- remark --> stu <?ab cde?> test</dummy>};

         my $rdr = XML::Reader->new(\$text, {parse_ct => 1, parse_pi => 1});

         while ($rdr->iterate) {
             if ($rdr->is_decl)    { my %h = %{$rdr->dec_hash};
                                     print "Found decl     ",  join('', map{" $_='$h{$_}'"} sort keys %h), "\n"; }
             if ($rdr->is_proc)    { print "Found proc      ", "t=", $rdr->proc_tgt, ", d=", $rdr->proc_data, "\n"; }
             if ($rdr->is_comment) { print "Found comment   ", $rdr->comment, "\n"; }
             print "Text '", $rdr->value, "'\n" unless $rdr->is_decl;
         }

       Note the "unless $rdr->is_decl" in the above code. This is to avoid
       outputting any value after the XML declaration (which would be empty
       anyway).

       Here is the output:

         Found decl      version='1.0'
         Text 'xyz'
         Found comment   remark
         Text 'stu'
         Found proc      t=ab, d=cde
         Text 'test'

OPTION FILTER / MODE
       Option {filter => } or {mode => } allows to select different operation
       modes when processing the XML data.

   Option filter 2 mode attr-bef-start
       With option {filter => 2} or {mode => 'attr-bef-start'}, XML::Reader
       produces one line for each character event.  A preceding start-tag
       results in method is_start to be set to 1, a trailing end-tag results
       in method is_end to be set to 1. Likewise, a preceding comment results
       in method is_comment to be set to 1, a preceding XML-declaration
       results in method is_decl to be set to 1, a preceding processing-
       instruction results in method is_proc to be set to 1.

       Also, attribute lines are added via the special '/@...' syntax.

       Option {filter => 2, mode => 'attr-bef-start'} is the default.

       Here is an example...

         use XML::Reader qw(XML::Parser);

         my $text = q{<root><test param='&lt;&gt;v"'><a><b>"e"<data id="&lt;&gt;z'">'g'&amp;&lt;&gt;</data>}.
                    q{f</b></a></test>x <!-- remark --> yz</root>};

         my $rdr = XML::Reader->new(\$text);

         # the following four alternatives are equivalent:
         # -----------------------------------------------
         #   XML::Reader->new(\$text);
         #   XML::Reader->new(\$text, {filter => 2                          });
         #   XML::Reader->new(\$text, {filter => 2, mode => 'attr-bef-start'});
         #   XML::Reader->new(\$text, {             mode => 'attr-bef-start'});

         while ($rdr->iterate) {
             printf "Path: %-24s, Value: %s\n", $rdr->path, $rdr->value;
         }

       This program (with implicit option {filter => 2, mode =>
       'attr-bef-start'} as default) produces the following output:

         Path: /root                   , Value:
         Path: /root/test/@param       , Value: <>v"
         Path: /root/test              , Value:
         Path: /root/test/a            , Value:
         Path: /root/test/a/b          , Value: "e"
         Path: /root/test/a/b/data/@id , Value: <>z'
         Path: /root/test/a/b/data     , Value: 'g'&<>
         Path: /root/test/a/b          , Value: f
         Path: /root/test/a            , Value:
         Path: /root/test              , Value:
         Path: /root                   , Value: x yz

       The same {filter => 2, mode => 'attr-bef-start'} also allows to rebuild
       the structure of the XML with the help of the methods "is_start" and
       "is_end". To make things more interesting, we have the following
       additional requirement: We want any text (but not tags and not
       attributes) to be wrapped inside a pair of "**...**" when it is
       displayed. Please note also that in the above output, the first line
       ("Path: /root, Value:") is empty, but important for the structure of
       the XML. Therefore we can't ignore it.

       Let us now look at the same example (with option {filter => 2, mode =>
       'attr-bef-start'}), but with an additional algorithm to reconstruct the
       original XML plus the additional requirement to wrap text (but not tags
       and not attributes) inside "** **":

         use XML::Reader qw(XML::Parser);

         my $text = q{<root><test param='&lt;&gt;v"'><a><b>"e"<data id="&lt;&gt;z'">'g'&amp;&lt;&gt;</data>}.
                    q{f</b></a></test>x <!-- remark --> yz</root>};

         my $rdr = XML::Reader->new(\$text);

         # the following four alternatives are equivalent:
         # -----------------------------------------------
         #   XML::Reader->new(\$text);
         #   XML::Reader->new(\$text, {filter => 2                          });
         #   XML::Reader->new(\$text, {filter => 2, mode => 'attr-bef-start'});
         #   XML::Reader->new(\$text, {             mode => 'attr-bef-start'});

         my %at;

         while ($rdr->iterate) {
             my $indentation = '  ' x ($rdr->level - 1);

             if ($rdr->type eq '@')  {
                 $at{$rdr->attr} = $rdr->value;
                 for ($at{$rdr->attr}) {
                     s{&}'&amp;'xmsg;
                     s{'}'&apos;'xmsg;
                     s{<}'&lt;'xmsg;
                     s{>}'&gt;'xmsg;
                 }
             }


             if ($rdr->is_start) {
                 print $indentation, '<', $rdr->tag, join('', map{" $_='$at{$_}'"} sort keys %at), '>', "\n";
             }

             unless ($rdr->type eq '@') { %at = (); }

             if ($rdr->type eq 'T' and $rdr->value ne '') {
                 my $v = $rdr->value;
                 for ($v) {
                     s{&}'&amp;'xmsg;
                     s{<}'&lt;'xmsg;
                     s{>}'&gt;'xmsg;
                 }
                 print $indentation, "  ** $v **\n";
             }

             if ($rdr->is_end) {
                 print $indentation, '</', $rdr->tag, '>', "\n";
             }
         }

       ...and here is the output:

         <root>
           <test param='&lt;&gt;v"'>
             <a>
               <b>
                 ** "e" **
                 <data id='&lt;&gt;z&apos;'>
                   ** 'g'&amp;&lt;&gt; **
                 </data>
                 ** f **
               </b>
             </a>
           </test>
           ** x yz **
         </root>

       ...this is proof that the original structure of the XML is not lost.

   Option filter 3 mode attr-in-hash
       Option {filter => 3, mode => 'attr-in-hash'} works very much like
       {filter => 2, mode => 'attr-bef-start'}.

       The difference, though, is that with option {filter => 3, mode =>
       'attr-in-hash'} all attribute-lines are suppressed and instead, the
       attributes are presented for each start-line in the hash
       $rdr->att_hash().

       This allows, in fact, to dispense with the global %at variable of the
       previous algorithm, and use %{$rdr->att_hash} instead:

       Here is the new algorithm for {filter => 3, mode => 'attr-in-hash'}, we
       don't need to worry about attributes (that is, we don't need to check
       for $rdr->type eq '@') and, as already mentioned, the %at variable is
       replaced by %{$rdr->att_hash} :

         use XML::Reader qw(XML::Parser);

         my $text = q{<root><test param='&lt;&gt;v"'><a><b>"e"<data id="&lt;&gt;z'">'g'&amp;&lt;&gt;</data>}.
                    q{f</b></a></test>x <!-- remark --> yz</root>};

         my $rdr = XML::Reader->new(\$text, {filter => 3});

         # the following three alternatives are equivalent:
         # ------------------------------------------------
         #   XML::Reader->new(\$text, {filter => 3                        });
         #   XML::Reader->new(\$text, {filter => 3, mode => 'attr-in-hash'});
         #   XML::Reader->new(\$text, {             mode => 'attr-in-hash'});

         while ($rdr->iterate) {
             my $indentation = '  ' x ($rdr->level - 1);

             if ($rdr->is_start) {
                 my %h = %{$rdr->att_hash};
                 for (values %h) {
                     s{&}'&amp;'xmsg;
                     s{'}'&apos;'xmsg;
                     s{<}'&lt;'xmsg;
                     s{>}'&gt;'xmsg;
                 }
                 print $indentation, '<', $rdr->tag,
                   join('', map{" $_='$h{$_}'"} sort keys %h),
                   '>', "\n";
             }

             if ($rdr->type eq 'T' and $rdr->value ne '') {
                 my $v = $rdr->value;
                 for ($v) {
                     s{&}'&amp;'xmsg;
                     s{<}'&lt;'xmsg;
                     s{>}'&gt;'xmsg;
                 }
                 print $indentation, "  ** $v **\n";
             }

             if ($rdr->is_end) {
                 print $indentation, '</', $rdr->tag, '>', "\n";
             }
         }

       ...the output for {filter => 3, mode => 'attr-in-hash'} is identical to
       the output for {filter => 2, mode => 'attr-bef-start'}:

         <root>

                 ** "e" **
                 <data id='&lt;&gt;z&apos;'>
                   ** 'g'&amp;&lt;&gt; **
                 </data>
                 ** f **
               </b>
             </a>
           </test>
           ** x yz **
         </root>

       Finally, we can (and we should) delegate the writing of XML to another
       module. I would suggest that we use XML::MinWriter for that. Here is
       the program that uses XML::MinWriter to output XML:

         use XML::Reader qw(XML::Parser);
         use XML::MinWriter;

         my $text = q{<root><test param='&lt;&gt;v"'><a><b>"e"<data id="&lt;&gt;z'">'g'&amp;&lt;&gt;</data>}.
                    q{f</b></a></test>x <!-- remark --> yz</root>};

         my $rdr = XML::Reader->new(\$text, {filter => 3});
         my $wrt = XML::MinWriter->new(OUTPUT => \*STDOUT, NEWLINES => 1);

         while ($rdr->iterate) {
             if ($rdr->is_start)                          { $wrt->startTag($rdr->tag, %{$rdr->att_hash}); }
             if ($rdr->type eq 'T' and $rdr->value ne '') { $wrt->characters('** '.$rdr->value.' **'); }
             if ($rdr->is_end)                            { $wrt->endTag($rdr->tag); }
         }

         $wrt->end();

       Here is the output from XML::MinWriter:

         <root
         ><test param="&lt;&gt;v&quot;"
         ><a
         ><b
         >** "e" **<data id="&lt;&gt;z'"
         >** 'g'&amp;&lt;&gt; **</data
         >** f **</b
         ></a
         ></test
         >** x yz **</root
         >

       The format written by XML::MinWriter needs some getting used to, but it
       is valid XML.

   Option filter 4 mode pyx
       Although this is not the main purpose of XML::Reader, option {filter =>
       4, mode => 'pyx'} can generate individual lines for start-tags, end-
       tags, comments, processing-instructions and XML-Declarations. Its aim
       is to generate a pyx string for further processing and analysis.

       Here is an example:

         use XML::Reader qw(XML::Parser);

         my $text = q{<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
           <delta>
             <dim alter="511">
               <gamma />
               <beta>
                 car <?tt dat?>
               </beta>
             </dim>
             dskjfh <!-- remark --> uuu
           </delta>};

         my $rdr = XML::Reader->new(\$text, {filter => 4, parse_pi => 1});

         # the following three alternatives are equivalent:
         # ------------------------------------------------
         #   XML::Reader->new(\$text, {filter => 4               , parse_pi => 1});
         #   XML::Reader->new(\$text, {filter => 4, mode => 'pyx', parse_pi => 1});
         #   XML::Reader->new(\$text, {             mode => 'pyx', parse_pi => 1});

         while ($rdr->iterate) {
             printf "Type = %1s, pyx = %s\n", $rdr->type, $rdr->pyx;
         }

       And here is the output:

         Type = D, pyx = ?xml version='1.0' encoding='iso-8859-1'
         Type = S, pyx = (delta
         Type = S, pyx = (dim
         Type = @, pyx = Aalter 511
         Type = S, pyx = (gamma
         Type = E, pyx = )gamma
         Type = S, pyx = (beta
         Type = T, pyx = -car
         Type = ?, pyx = ?tt dat
         Type = E, pyx = )beta
         Type = E, pyx = )dim
         Type = T, pyx = -dskjfh uuu
         Type = E, pyx = )delta

       Be aware that comments can be produced by "pyx" in a non-standard way
       if requested by {parse_ct => 1}. In fact, comments are produced with a
       leading hash symbol which is not part of the pyx specification, as can
       be seen by the following example:

         use XML::Reader qw(XML::Parser);

         my $text = q{
           <delta>
             <!-- remark -->
           </delta>};

         my $rdr = XML::Reader->new(\$text, {filter => 4, parse_ct => 1});

         # the following three alternatives are equivalent:
         # ------------------------------------------------
         #   XML::Reader->new(\$text, {filter => 4,                parse_ct => 1});
         #   XML::Reader->new(\$text, {filter => 4, mode => 'pyx', parse_ct => 1});
         #   XML::Reader->new(\$text, {             mode => 'pyx', parse_ct => 1});

         while ($rdr->iterate) {
             printf "Type = %1s, pyx = %s\n", $rdr->type, $rdr->pyx;
         }

       Here is the output:

         Type = S, pyx = (delta
         Type = #, pyx = #remark
         Type = E, pyx = )delta

       Finally, when operating with {filter => 4, mode => 'pyx'}, the usual
       methods ("value", "attr", "path", "is_start", "is_end", "is_decl",
       "is_proc", "is_comment", "is_attr", "is_text", "is_value", "comment",
       "proc_tgt", "proc_data", "dec_hash" or "att_hash") remain operational.
       Here is an example:

         use XML::Reader qw(XML::Parser);

         my $text = q{<?xml version="1.0"?>
           <parent abc="def"> <?pt hmf?>
             dskjfh <!-- remark -->
             <child>ghi</child>
           </parent>};

         my $rdr = XML::Reader->new(\$text, {filter => 4, parse_ct => 1, parse_pi => 1});

         # the following three alternatives are equivalent:
         # ------------------------------------------------
         #   XML::Reader->new(\$text, {filter => 4,                parse_ct => 1, parse_pi => 1});
         #   XML::Reader->new(\$text, {filter => 4, mode => 'pyx', parse_ct => 1, parse_pi => 1});
         #   XML::Reader->new(\$text, {             mode => 'pyx', parse_ct => 1, parse_pi => 1});

         while ($rdr->iterate) {
             printf "Path %-15s v=%s ", $rdr->path, $rdr->is_value;

             if    ($rdr->is_start)   { print "Found start tag ", $rdr->tag, "\n"; }
             elsif ($rdr->is_end)     { print "Found end tag   ", $rdr->tag, "\n"; }
             elsif ($rdr->is_decl)    { my %h = %{$rdr->dec_hash};
                                        print "Found decl     ",  join('', map{" $_='$h{$_}'"} sort keys %h), "\n"; }
             elsif ($rdr->is_proc)    { print "Found proc      ", "t=",    $rdr->proc_tgt, ", d=", $rdr->proc_data, "\n"; }
             elsif ($rdr->is_comment) { print "Found comment   ", $rdr->comment, "\n"; }
             elsif ($rdr->is_attr)    { print "Found attribute ", $rdr->attr, "='", $rdr->value, "'\n"; }
             elsif ($rdr->is_text)    { print "Found text      ", $rdr->value, "\n"; }
         }

       Here is the output:

         Path /               v=0 Found decl      version='1.0'
         Path /parent         v=0 Found start tag parent
         Path /parent/@abc    v=1 Found attribute abc='def'
         Path /parent         v=0 Found proc      t=pt, d=hmf
         Path /parent         v=1 Found text      dskjfh
         Path /parent         v=0 Found comment   remark
         Path /parent/child   v=0 Found start tag child
         Path /parent/child   v=1 Found text      ghi
         Path /parent/child   v=0 Found end tag   child
         Path /parent         v=0 Found end tag   parent

       Note that v=1 (i.e. $rdr->is_value == 1) for all text and all
       attributes.

   Option filter 5 mode branches
       With option {filter => 5, mode => 'branches'}, you specify one (or
       many) roots, each root has a set of branches attached.  What you then
       get back is one record for each occurence of a root in the XML tree.  A
       root can start with a single slash (such as {root => '/tag1/tag2'}), in
       which case the path is absolute, or it can start with a double-slash
       (such as {root => '//tag1/tag2'}), in which case the path is relative.
       If you start your root with no slash at all (such as {root =>
       'tag1/tag2'}), your path is also relative.

       Each record then contains the elements that have been specified in the
       branches. (As a special case, the branch can be a single '*' character,
       in which case the complete XML is produced for the root).

       To obtain the elements that have been specified in the branches, you
       can use function $rdr->rvalue.

       The easiest way to explain its effect is to show an example.

         use XML::Reader qw(XML::Parser);

         my $line2 = q{
         <data>
           <supplier>ggg</supplier>
           <customer name="o'rob" id="444">
             <street>pod alley</street>
             <city>no city</city>
           </customer>
           <customer1 name="troy" id="333">
             <street>one way</street>
             <city>any city</city>
           </customer1>
           <tcustomer name="nbc" id="777">
             <street>away</street>
             <city>acity</city>
           </tcustomer>
           <supplier>hhh</supplier>
           <zzz>
             <customer name='"sue"' id="111">
               <street>baker street</street>
               <city>sidney</city>
             </customer>
           </zzz>
           <order>
             <database>
               <customer name="&lt;smith&gt;" id="652">
                 <street>high street</street>
                 <city>boston</city>
               </customer>
               <customer name="&amp;jones" id="184">
                 <street>maple street</street>
                 <city>new york</city>
               </customer>
               <customer name="stewart" id="520">
                 <street>  ring   road   </street>
                 <city>  "'&amp;&lt;&#65;&gt;'"  </city>
               </customer>
             </database>
           </order>
           <dummy value="ttt">test</dummy>
           <supplier>iii</supplier>
           <supplier>jjj</supplier>
           <p>
             <p>b1</p>
             <p>b2</p>
           </p>
           <p>
             b3
           </p>
         </data>
         };

       Let's say we want to read the name, the street and the city of all
       customers in any relative path ('customer') and we also want to read
       the supplier in the absolute path '/data/supplier'. Then, we want to
       have data for the relative customer ('//customer') supplied as pure XML
       ({branch => '*'}). Finally we want to have data for the relative path
       'p' as pure XML.

       Data for our first root ('customer') is identified by $rdr->rx == 0,
       data for our second root ('/data/supplier') is identified by $rdr->rx
       == 1, data for our third root ('//customer') is identified by $rdr->rx
       == 2, data for our fourth root ('p') is identified by $rdr->rx == 3 and
       data for our fifth root ('customer') is identified by $rdr->rx ==4.

       Please note in the example below that {branch => '*'} means that the
       data is returned as pure XML and that {branch => '+'} means that the
       data is returned as an array of PYX elements.

       In the following program we will use function rdr->rvalue to obtain the
       data:

         my $rdr = XML::Reader->new(\$line2, {filter => 5},
           { root => 'customer',       branch => ['@name', 'street', 'city'] },
           { root => '/data/supplier', branch => ['/']                       },
           { root => '//customer',     branch => '*' },
           { root => 'p',              branch => '*' },
           { root => '//customer',     branch => '+' },
         );

         # the following three alternatives are equivalent:
         # ------------------------------------------------
         #   XML::Reader->new(\$line2, {filter => 5,                   });
         #   XML::Reader->new(\$line2, {filter => 5, mode => 'branches'});
         #   XML::Reader->new(\$line2, {             mode => 'branches'});

         my $root0 = '';
         my $root1 = '';
         my $root2 = '';
         my $root3 = '';
         my $root4 = '';

         my $path0 = '';

         while ($rdr->iterate) {
             if ($rdr->rx == 0) {
                 $path0 .= "  ".$rdr->path."\n";
                 for ($rdr->rvalue) {
                     $root0 .= sprintf "  Cust: Name = %-7s Street = %-12s City = %s\n", $_->[0], $_->[1], $_->[2];
                 }
             }
             elsif ($rdr->rx == 1) {
                 for ($rdr->rvalue) {
                     $root1 .= "  Supp: Name = $_->[0]\n";
                 }
             }
             elsif ($rdr->rx == 2) {
                 for ($rdr->rvalue) {
                     $root2 .= "  Xml: $_\n";
                 }
             }
             elsif ($rdr->rx == 3) {
                 for ($rdr->rvalue) {
                     $root3 .= "  P: $_\n";
                 }
             }
             elsif ($rdr->rx == 4) {
                 for ($rdr->rvalue) {
                     local $" = "', '";
                     $root4 .= "  Pyx: '@$_'\n";
                 }
             }
         }

         print "root0:\n$root0\n";
         print "path0:\n$path0\n";
         print "root1:\n$root1\n";
         print "root2:\n$root2\n";
         print "root3:\n$root3\n";
         print "root4:\n$root4\n";

       This is the output:

         root0:
           Cust: Name = o'rob   Street = pod alley    City = no city
           Cust: Name = "sue"   Street = baker street City = sidney

       We can also use function rdr->value to obtain the same data:

         my $rdr = XML::Reader->new(\$line2, {filter => 5},
           { root => 'customer',       branch => ['@name', 'street', 'city'] },
           { root => 'p',              branch => '*' },
         );

         # the following three alternatives are equivalent:
         # ------------------------------------------------
         #   XML::Reader->new(\$line2, {filter => 5,                   });
         #   XML::Reader->new(\$line2, {filter => 5, mode => 'branches'});
         #   XML::Reader->new(\$line2, {             mode => 'branches'});

         my $out0 = '';
         my $out1 = '';

         while ($rdr->iterate) {
             if ($rdr->rx == 0) {
                 my @rv = $rdr->value;
                 $out0 .= sprintf "  Cust: Name = %-7s Street = %-12s City = %s\n", $rv[0], $rv[1], $rv[2];
             }
             elsif ($rdr->rx == 1) {
                 $out1 .= "  P: ".$rdr->value."\n";
             }
         }

         print "output0:\n$out0\n";
         print "output1:\n$out1\n";

       This is the output:

         output0:
           Cust: Name = o'rob   Street = pod alley    City = no city
           Cust: Name = "sue"   Street = baker street City = sidney
           Cust: Name = <smith> Street = high street  City = boston
           Cust: Name = &jones  Street = maple street City = new york
           Cust: Name = stewart Street = ring road    City = "'&<A>'"

         output1:
           P: <p><p>b1</p><p>b2</p></p>
           P: <p>b3</p>

       It is important to notice here that the case "root3" / "output1" { root
       => 'p', branch => '*' } clearly shows that always the biggest possible
       XML subtree is matched for relative roots. In other words, the output
       of "P: <p>b1</p>" and "P: <p>b2</p>" on its own line is not possible,
       because they are already part of the bigger line "P:
       <p><p>b1</p><p>b2</p></p>".

OPTION DUPATT
       Option dupatt allows for multiple attributes to be presented in one
       single result. To achieve this, the duplicates are concatenated using a
       special concatenation character.  The list of attributes is then sorted
       alphabetically.

       Option dupatt is only available if XML::Reader has been used with the
       XML::Parsepp option.

       For example, the following code allows for duplicate attributes
       concatenated by character "|": (The concatenation string {dupatt =>
       $str} is restricted to printable ascii excluding alphanumeric, " and ')

         use XML::Reader qw(XML::Parsepp);

         my $text = q{<data><item a2="abc" a1="def" a2="ghi"></item></data>}

         my $rdr = XML::Reader->new(\$text, {dupatt => '|'});
         while ($rdr->iterate) {
             printf "Path: %-19s, Value: %s\n", $rdr->path, $rdr->value;
         }

       This program produces the following output:

         Path: /data              , Value:
         Path: /data/item/@a1     , Value: def
         Path: /data/item/@a2     , Value: abc|ghi
         Path: /data/item         , Value:
         Path: /data              , Value:

EXAMPLES
       Let's look at the following piece of XML from which we want to extract
       the values in <item> (by that I mean only the first 'start...'-value,
       not the 'end...'-value), plus the attributes "p1" and "p3". The item-
       tag must be exactly in the /start/param/data range (and *not* in the
       /start/param/dataz range).

         my $text = q{
           <start>
             <param>
               <data>
                 <item p1="a" p2="b" p3="c">start1 <inner p1="p">i1</inner> end1</item>
                 <item p1="d" p2="e" p3="f">start2 <inner p1="q">i2</inner> end2</item>
                 <item p1="g" p2="h" p3="i">start3 <inner p1="r">i3</inner> end3</item>
               </data>
               <dataz>
                 <item p1="j" p2="k" p3="l">start9 <inner p1="s">i9</inner> end9</item>
               </dataz>
               <data>
                 <item p1="m" p2="n" p3="o">start4 <inner p1="t">i4</inner> end4</item>
               </data>
             </param>
           </start>};

       We expect exactly 4 output-lines from our parse (i.e. we don't expect
       the 'dataz' part - 'start9' - in the output):

         item = 'start1', p1 = 'a', p3 = 'c'
         item = 'start2', p1 = 'd', p3 = 'f'
         item = 'start3', p1 = 'g', p3 = 'i'
         item = 'start4', p1 = 'm', p3 = 'o'

   Example filter 2 mode attr-bef-start
       Here is a sample program to parse that XML with {filter => 2, mode =>
       'attr-bef-start'}. (Note how the prefix '/start/param/data/item' is
       located in the {using =>} option of new). We need two scalars ('$p1'
       and '$p3') to hold the parameters in '/@p1' and in '/@p3' and carry
       them over to the $rdr->is_start section, where they can be printed.

         my $rdr = XML::Reader->new(\$text,
           {mode => 'attr-bef-start', using => '/start/param/data/item'});

         my ($p1, $p3);

         while ($rdr->iterate) {
             if    ($rdr->path eq '/@p1') { $p1 = $rdr->value; }
             elsif ($rdr->path eq '/@p3') { $p3 = $rdr->value; }
             elsif ($rdr->path eq '/' and $rdr->is_start) {
                 printf "item = '%s', p1 = '%s', p3 = '%s'\n",
                   $rdr->value, $p1, $p3;
             }
             unless ($rdr->is_attr) { $p1 = undef; $p3 = undef; }
         }

   Example filter 3 mode attr-in-hash
       With {filter => 3, mode => 'attr-in-hash'} we can dispense with the two
       scalars '$p1' and '$p3', the code becomes very simple:

         my $rdr = XML::Reader->new(\$text,
           {mode => 'attr-in-hash', using => '/start/param/data/item'});

         while ($rdr->iterate) {
             if ($rdr->path eq '/' and $rdr->is_start) {
                 printf "item = '%s', p1 = '%s', p3 = '%s'\n",
                   $rdr->value, $rdr->att_hash->{p1}, $rdr->att_hash->{p3};
             }
         }

   Example filter 4 mode pyx
       With {filter => 4, mode => 'pyx'}, however, the code becomes slightly
       more complicated again: As already shown for {filter => 2, mode =>
       'attr-bef-start'}, we need again two scalars ('$p1' and '$p3') to hold
       the parameters in '/@p1' and in '/@p3' and carry them over. In addition
       to that, we also need a way to count text-values (see scalar '$count'),
       so that we can distinguish between the first value 'start...'  (that we
       want to print) and the second value 'end...' (that we do not want to
       print).

         my $rdr = XML::Reader->new(\$text,
           {mode => 'pyx', using => '/start/param/data/item'});

         my ($count, $p1, $p3);

         while ($rdr->iterate) {
             if    ($rdr->path eq '/@p1') { $p1 = $rdr->value; }
             elsif ($rdr->path eq '/@p3') { $p3 = $rdr->value; }
             elsif ($rdr->path eq '/') {
                 if    ($rdr->is_start) { $count = 0; $p1 = undef; $p3 = undef; }
                 elsif ($rdr->is_text) {
                     $count++;
                     if ($count == 1) {
                         printf "item = '%s', p1 = '%s', p3 = '%s'\n",
                           $rdr->value, $p1, $p3;
                     }
                 }
             }
         }

   Example filter 5 mode branches
       You could combine {mode => 'branches'} and regular expressions to parse
       the XML:

         my $rdr = XML::Reader->new(\$text, {mode => 'branches'},
           { root => '/start/param/data/item', branch => '*' });

         while ($rdr->iterate) {
             if ($rdr->value =~ m{\A <item
                 (?:\s+ p1='([^']*)')?
                 (?:\s+ p2='([^']*)')?
                 (?:\s+ p3='([^']*)')?
                 \s* > ([^<]*) <}xms) {
                 printf "item = '%s', p1 = '%s', p3 = '%s'\n", $4, $1, $3;
             }
         }

   Example Attribut conditions
       Let's also consider a different example ($text3):

         my $text3 = q{
           <data>
             <database loc="alpha">
               <item>
                 <customer name="smith" id="652">
                   <street>high street</street>
                   <city>rio</city>
                 </customer>
                 <customer name="jones" id="184">
                   <street>maple street</street>
                   <city>new york</city>

               </item>
             </database>
             <database loc="beta">
               <item>
                 <customer name="smith" id="001">
                   <street>nowhere</street>
                   <city>st malo</city>
                 </customer>
                 <customer name="jones" id="002">
                   <street>all the way</street>

                 <customer name="gates" id="003">
                   <street>bypass</street>
                   <city>rome</city>
                 </customer>
               </item>
             </database>
             <database loc="alpha">

                 <customer name="peter" id="444">

                 <customer name="gates" id="959">
                   <street>don't leave me this way</street>
                   <city>cambridge</city>
                 </customer>
               </item>
             </database>
             <database loc="alpha">
               <item>
                 <customer name="smith" id="881">
                   <street>anyway</street>
                   <city>big apple</city>
                 </customer>
                 <customer name="thatcher" id="504">
                   <street>baker street</street>
                   <city>oxford</city>

               </item>
             </database>
           </data>
         };

       You can also use attribute conditions ('/path1[@attr="val"]/...')
       inside the path statements (root => ... and branch => ...) like so:

         my $rdr = XML::Reader->new(\$text3, {mode => 'branches', sepchar => '|'}, {
           root   => '/data/database[@loc="alpha"]',
           branch => [
             'item/customer[@name="smith"]/city',
             'item/customer[@name="gates"]/city',
           ]});

         while ($rdr->iterate) {
             my ($smith, $gates) = $rdr->value;

             $smith = defined($smith) ? "'$smith'" : 'undef';
             $gates = defined($gates) ? "'$gates'" : 'undef';

             printf "smith = %-12s, gates = %s\n", $smith, $gates;
         }

       The output is as follows:

         smith = 'rio|ny'    , gates = 'dallas'
         smith = undef       , gates = 'cambridge'
         smith = 'big apple' , gates = undef

FUNCTIONS
   Function slurp_xml
       The function slurp_xml reads an XML file and slurps it into an array-
       ref. Here is an example where we want to slurp the name, the street and
       the city of all customers in the path '/data/order/database/customer'
       and we also want to slurp the supplier in '/data/supplier':

         use XML::Reader qw(XML::Parser slurp_xml);

         my $line2 = q{
         <data>
           <supplier>ggg</supplier>
           <supplier>hhh</supplier>
           <order>
             <database>
               <customer name="smith" id="652">
                 <street>high street</street>
                 <city>boston</city>
               </customer>
               <customer name="jones" id="184">
                 <street>maple street</street>
                 <city>new york</city>
               </customer>
               <customer name="stewart" id="520">
                 <street>ring road</street>
                 <city>dallas</city>
               </customer>
             </database>
           </order>
           <dummy value="ttt">test</dummy>
           <supplier>iii</supplier>
           <supplier>jjj</supplier>
         </data>
         };

         my $aref = slurp_xml(\$line2,
           { root => '/data/order/database/customer', branch => ['@name', 'street', 'city'] },
           { root => '/data/supplier',                branch => '*'                         },
         );

         for (@{$aref->[0]}) {
             printf "Cust: Name = %-7s Street = %-12s City = %s\n", $_->[0], $_->[1], $_->[2];
         }

         print "\n";

         for (@{$aref->[1]}) {
             printf "S: %s\n", $_;
         }

       The first parameter to slurp_xml is the filename (or scalar reference,
       or open filehandle) of the XML that will be slurped. In this case we
       read from a scalar ref \$line2. The next parameter is a hash-ref with
       the root of the sub-tree that we want to slurp (in our case that's
       '/data/order/database/customer') and the branches, a list of the
       elements that we want to slurp, relative to the sub-tree. In this case
       it is ['@name', 'street', 'city']. The next parameter is our second
       root/branch definition, in this case it is root => '/data/supplier'
       with branch => ['/'].

       Here is the output:

         Cust: Name = smith   Street = high street  City = boston
         Cust: Name = jones   Street = maple street City = new york
         Cust: Name = stewart Street = ring road    City = dallas

         S: <supplier>ggg</supplier>
         S: <supplier>hhh</supplier>
         S: <supplier>iii</supplier>
         S: <supplier>jjj</supplier>

       slurp_xml works similar to XML::Simple, in that it reads all required
       information in one go into an in-memory data structure. The difference,
       however, is that slurp_xml lets you be specific in what you actually
       want before you do the slurping, so that in most cases your in-memory
       data structure is smaller and less complicated.

       You can instruct slurp_xml to allow duplicate attributes. In this case
       you need to do two things: One, you need to use XML::Reader with both
       qw(XML::Parsepp slurp_xml). Two, you need to call slurp_xml with option
       { dupatt => '|' }, like so:

         use XML::Reader qw(XML::Parsepp slurp_xml);

         my $line3 = q{<data atr1='abc' atr2='def' atr1='ghi'></data>};

         my $aref = slurp_xml(\$line3,
           { dupatt => '|' },
           { root => '/', branch => '*' });

         print $aref->[0][0], "\n";

       Here is the output:

         <data atr1='abc|ghi' atr2='def'></data>
