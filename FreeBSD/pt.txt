NAME
     pt – SCSI processor type driver

SYNOPSIS
     device pt

DESCRIPTION
     The pt driver provides support for a SCSI processor type device.  These
     are usually scanners and other devices using the SCSI link as a
     communication interface with device specific commands embedded in the
     data stream.

     A SCSI adapter must be separately configured into the system before this
     driver can be used.

     This device supports read(2) and write(2), and the ioctl(2) calls
     described below.

IOCTLS
     The following ioctl(2) calls are supported by the pt driver.  They are
     defined in the header file <sys/ptio.h>.

     PTIOCGETTIMEOUT  This ioctl allows userland applications to fetch the
                      current pt driver read and write timeout.  The value
                      returned is in seconds.

     PTIOCSETTIMEOUT  This ioctl allows userland applications to set the
                      current pt driver read and write timeouts.  The value
                      should be in seconds.

FILES
     /dev/ptN    the Nth processor device.
