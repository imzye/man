NAME
       gubby - The procmail new email agent - v0.5.5

SYNPOSIS
       gubby [hvcowlVbsH] [BmMpC value] [procmail logfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Gubby keeps track of when and where procmail delivers your email.

LONGER DESCRIPTION
       Scans a procmail logfile and display a realtime-updated display of
       mailboxes and new email.  Reads mailbox contents using a specified
       external mailreader (or MUA).

       Output is normally displayed in a curses environment, but can also be
       printed conveniently to the standard output from the command prompt.

       Gubby is a compact, efficient and powerful ``once-and-for-all'' rewrite
       of an old shell script.

GUESSING THE LOGFILE LOCATION
       If called without arguments, gubby searches for a procmail
       configuration file in $HOME/.procmailrc, scans it for a line beginning
       with LOGFILE=, and finally tries to parse the procmail logfile.

       A complaint is filed to stderr if no files are found, and you'll have
       to supply the location of the file as a program argument.

SETTING UP PROCMAIL
       For gubby to work, you must enable logging in your procmail
       configuration file.  This is done by adding a line such as
       LOGFILE=~/.log-procmail near the top.

OPTIONS
       -h  Print help and exit.

       -v  Print version info and exit.

       -c  Empty logfile and exit.

       -m path
           Specifies which program Gubby calls to read your mailboxes.

       -M path
           Specifies path to your local mailboxes.  If this is set in your
           ~/.procmailrc file as MAILDIR=..., then this is the directory used.
           (This is only true when no logfile is specified as a program
           parameter)

       -p args
           Used with -m.  Specifies program arguments to your mailreader when
           Gubby launches it to read a mailbox.  These parameters should be
           the one telling your mailreader to "read this mailbox: ...".

           For instance, with Mutt, the argument is "-f", and the
           corresponding command Gubby will execute when a mailbox is selected
           for reading will be:  mutt -f mailboxname

       -C args
           Used with -m.  Specifies which arguments are needed for your
           mailprogram to start composing a new mail.

       -o  Print new mail and exit.

       -w  Used with -o.  Prints folders in wide listing format, meaning that
           mailbox contents (i.e., From and Subject values) are printed as
           well.

       -b  Triggers the terminal bell (beep) on new mail.

           This may not be as annoying as it sounds.  Some terminal emulators
           can be configured what to do on terminal bells.  For instance,
           PuTTY (a terminal emulator) can make the window taskbar flash on
           bells.

       -s  Used with -b:  Do not trigger bell when new mail is thrown in
           /dev/null.

       -H  Do not show /dev/null as a folder in the view at all.

       -l  Start Gubby in curses environment. (default)

       -V  Be verbose:  Send warnings and notices to stderr (deprecated; all
           errors are written to stderr).

RETURN
       0   Successful exit

       1   General Error

SIGNALS
       Gubby catches SIGSEGV and SIGINT, both causing Gubby to gracefully shut
       down it's curses environment before exiting with status 1.

FILES
       $HOME/.procmailrc
           If no logfile is specified as a program parameter, Gubby will try
           to read LOGFILE (and, optionally, MAILDIR) from your
           $HOME/.procmailrc configuration file.  If that doesn't exist, Gubby
           will exit with a complaint to stderr.

EXAMPLES
       gubby ~/.log-procmail
           Run gubby and read from ~/.log-procmail

       gubby -m /usr/bin/mutt -M ~/mail/ -p '-f'
           Run gubby on procmail logfile specified in $HOME/.procmailrc, use
           /usr/bin/mutt as a mailreader.  When a folder is selected, the
           command /usr/bin/mutt -f ~/mail/foldername will be executed.

       gubby -o
           Read Procmai logfile (finding its path from $HOME/.procmailrc),
           print its contents in a formatted and sorted style, and exit.

       gubby
           Try to find Procmail logfile from $HOME/.procmailrc and enter
           curses environment for displaying folders. Default mailreader is
           mutt.

BUGS
       I've had trouble with gubby messing up the screen when going back from
       suspended mode.  E.g., enter a folder by hitting enter (usually enters
       mutt), start composing a new mail (with e.g. vim) and then suspend
       everything with CTRL+Z.  When you do an "fg" again, somehow the screen
       is totally messed up.

       Other than that, the new "write to logfile" (the 'd'-key in the program
       view) does not write correct procmail logfiles, so use this one with
       caution.  It's there because it works on MY system, but I need feedback
       from users before I'll remove the "experimental" warning.

       Other issues:

       If gubby has trouble finding your Procmail logfile, be sure to specify
       it as the last argument.

       If you terminal is messed up, try setting the TERM variable to another
       value.  On Cygwin, I've had to set TERM=xterm og TERM=xterm-color
       instead of TERM=cygwin to get curses to draw to the screen properly.

       If you don't get colors, try setting TERM=xterm-colors

       If Gubby for some reason can't find your mailboxes, try setting the
       full path for your maildirectory as MAILDIR=... in your Procmail rc
       file.

       If you experience any other bugs, let me know!
