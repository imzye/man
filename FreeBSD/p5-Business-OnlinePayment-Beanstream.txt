DESCRIPTION
       This module allows you to link any e-commerce order processing system
       directly to Beanstream transaction server (http://www.beanstream.com).
       All transaction fields are submitted via GET or POST to the secure
       transaction server at the following URL:
       https://www.beanstream.com/scripts/process_transaction.asp. The
       following fields are required:

       login - merchant login (Beanstream-assigned nine digit identification
       number)
       action - type of transaction (Normal Authorization, Authorization Only)
       amount - total order amount
       invoice_number - the order number of the shopper's purchase
       owner - name of the card owner
       card_number - number of the credit card
       expiration - expiration date formated as 'mmyy' or 'mm/yy'
       name - name of the billing person
       address - billing address
       city - billing address city
       state - billing address state/province
       zip - billing address ZIP/postal code
       country - billing address country
       phone - billing contacts phone
       email - billing contact's email

       Beanstream supports the following credit card:

       - VISA
       - MasterCard
       - American Express Card
       - Discover Card
       - JCB
       - Diners

       Currently you may process only two types of transaction, namely 'Normal
       Authorization' (Purchase) and 'Authorization Only' (Pre-Auth).
