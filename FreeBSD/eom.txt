NAME
       eom - The Eye of MATE Image Viewer

SYNOPSIS
       eom [--fullscreen] [--disable-image-collection] [--slide-show] [--new
       instance] [FILES...]

DESCRIPTION
       eom or the Eye of MATE is the official image viewer for the MATE
       Desktop Environment. It aims to be simplistic, lightweight, and easy to
       use. The Eye of MATE may also be used to perform basic tasks like image
       flipping and rotation.

       Eye of MATE features a flexible plugin system which can be used to
       dynamically add new advanced features to eom itself. eom uses the gdk-
       pixbuf library, it can handle large images, zoom, and scroll with low
       memory usage.

       This manual page briefly documents the eom command.
