Module::Extract::VERSION(3)                User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Module::Extract::VERSION - Extract a module version safely

SYNOPSIS
               use Module::Extract::VERSION;

               my $version   # just the version
                       = Module::Extract::VERSION->parse_version_safely( $file );

               my @version_info # extra info
                       = Module::Extract::VERSION->parse_version_safely( $file );

DESCRIPTION
       This module lets you pull out of module source code the version number
       for the module. It assumes that there is only one $VERSION in the file
       and the entire $VERSION statement is on the same line.

   Class methods
       $class->parse_version_safely( FILE );
           Given a module file, return the module version. This works just
           like "mldistwatch" in PAUSE. It looks for the single line that has
           the $VERSION statement, extracts it, evals it in a Safe
           compartment, and returns the result.

           In scalar context, it returns just the version as a string. In list
           context, it returns the list of:

                   sigil
                   fully-qualified variable name
                   version value
                   file name
                   line number of $VERSION

       I stole the some of this code from "mldistwatch" in the PAUSE code by
       Andreas König, but I've moved most of it around.

       Andrey Starodubtsev added code to handle the v5.12 and v5.14 "package"
       syntax.
