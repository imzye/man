NAME
       Business::ISSN - Perl extension for International Standard Serial
       Numbers

SYNOPSIS
               use Business::ISSN;
               $issn_object = Business::ISSN->new('1456-5935');

               $issn_object = Business::ISSN->new('14565935');

               # print the ISSN (with hyphen)
               print $issn_object->as_string;

               # check to see if the ISSN is valid
               $issn_object->is_valid;

               #fix the ISSN checksum.  BEWARE:  the error might not be
               #in the checksum!
               $issn_object->fix_checksum;

               #EXPORTABLE FUNCTIONS

               use Business::ISSN qw( is_valid_checksum );

               #verify the checksum
               if( is_valid_checksum('01234567') ) { ... }

DESCRIPTION
       new($issn)
           The constructor accepts a scalar representing the ISSN.

           The string representing the ISSN may contain characters other than
           [0-9xX], although these will be removed in the internal
           representation.  The resulting string must look like an ISSN - the
           first seven characters must be digits and the eighth character must
           be a digit, 'x', or 'X'.

           The string passed as the ISSN need not be a valid ISSN as long as
           it superficially looks like one.  This allows one to use the
           "fix_checksum" method.

           One should check the validity of the ISSN with is_valid() rather
           than relying on the return value of the constructor.

           If all one wants to do is check the validity of an ISSN, one can
           skip the object-oriented  interface and use the
           c<is_valid_checksum()> function which is exportable on demand.

           If the constructor decides it can't create an object, it returns
           undef.  It may do this if the string passed as the ISSN can't be
           munged to the internal format.

       $obj->checksum
           Return the ISSN checksum.

       $obj->as_string
           Return the ISSN as a string.

           A terminating 'x' is changed to 'X'.

       $obj->is_valid
           Returns 1 if the checksum is valid.

           Returns 0 if the ISSN does not pass the checksum test.  The
           constructor accepts invalid ISSN's so that they might be fixed with
           "fix_checksum".

       $obj->fix_checksum
           Replace the eighth character with the checksum the corresponds to
           the previous seven digits.  This does not guarantee that the ISSN
           corresponds to the product one thinks it does, or that the ISSN
           corresponds to any product at all.  It only produces a string that
           passes the checksum routine.  If the ISSN passed to the constructor
           was invalid, the error might have been in any of the other nine
           positions.

   EXPORTABLE FUNCTIONS
       Some functions can be used without the object interface.  These do not
       use object technology behind the scenes.

       is_valid_checksum('01234567')
           Takes the ISSN string and runs it through the checksum comparison
           routine.  Returns 1 if the ISSN is valid, 0 otherwise.
