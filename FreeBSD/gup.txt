GUP(1)                  FreeBSD General Commands Manual                 GUP(1)

NAME
       gup - A Group Update Program that accepts commands by mail to edit a
       newsgroup subscription file for subsequent use by news systems such as
       INN and C-News.

SYNTAX
       gup [-hvP] -a active_path [-d home_directory] [-l log_path]
             [-m reply_headers] [-n newsgroups_path]
             [-s sites_directory] [-M Mail_command]

DESCRIPTION
       The sole purpose of gup is to automate the tedious process of editing
       group selection patterns defined in the news configuration files (eg:
       ``newsfeeds'' for INN and ``sys'' for C-News).

       Gup is of use to news administrators who spend an inordinate amount of
       time editing their news config files at the behest of the sites they
       feed.  In fact, once gup is installed, it is quite likely that manual
       edits of your ``newsfeeds'' or ``sys'' file will become a thing of the
       past.

       Gup is designed to be installed as a mail-server program that is fed an
       inbound mail via stdin.  Gup is usually invoked from a .forward file.
       Eg:

            "|/.../bin/gup -options...."

       Each site has an entry in the ``config'' file containing password and
       mail address details and a group selection file called ``groups'', see
       CONFIG, and GROUPS for more details.

       The news administrator of each site mails commands to gup.  There are
       commands to include and exclude group patterns, list the current
       patterns for that site and list the available newsgroups; see COMMANDS,
       for more details.

       The results are normally mailed back to the site's configured
       administrator.  However under some circumstances, the results are
       mailed to the originator or the local administrator; see PROCESSING,
       for further details.

       Gup does not directly change the news system's control files (eg,
       ``newsfeeds'' for INN).  Instead a trivial shell script must be run to
       concatenate all of the changed ``groups'' files together into an
       appropriately formatted file for your particular news system. (One is
       provided in the source kit for INN).

       Since each site has to be specifically configured in gup's ``config''
       file, access can be restricted to administrator's capable of managing
       their own group patterns.

OPTIONS
       Options can appear in any order on the command line. The most important
       point to note is that all of the paths and directories defined will
       normally be absolute paths unless you are intimately familiar with the
       way in which gup changes directories as it processes a mail (the
       possible exception here is the Sites_directory).

       -a active_path
              The path of the active file for your news system.  Before
              accepting any newsgroup identified in a command, gup validates
              the group against the active file. The command is rejected if no
              match is found.

       -d home_directory
              Defines gup's home directory.  Gup changes to this directory as
              soon as possible after starting up. If this option is not
              present, the current directory is used.  Gup looks for the
              ``config'' file in it's home directory.

       -h     Print out a help message showing the command line options, then
              exit.

       -l log_path
              A record of all significant requests are written to this file.
              If the path is relative, then it will be relative to gup's home
              directory; see the -d option).  Gup must be able to write to
              this file.  If the -l option is not used, then gup uses stderr.
              This is useful for testing purposes, but is unlikely to be of
              use in a .forward file.

       -m reply_headers
              When gup generates a mail response it only generates the ``TO:
              '' header line.  This option defines the path of a file that
              contains other RFC882 conformant header lines that are piped to
              the mail program (see the -M option).  In fact, if this file
              contains a body following the headers, then that will precede
              any text generated by gup.  If this path is not an absolute
              path, then it will be treated as relative to gup's home
              directory (see the -d option).

       -M Mail_command
              Gup pipes the rfc822 headers and the body of the mail to the
              nominated mail program. Normally, this is configured when gup is
              installed, but it can be over-ridden with this option. The mail
              command must be able to determine the recipient addresses from
              the rfc822 headers.

       -n newsgroups_path
              If present, the newsgroups file is used to try and find a
              matching description of newsgroup when listed.

       -P     Do not prune superfluous patterns from a site's ``groups'' file.
              Before writing the updated ``groups'' file, gup applies a fairly
              rigorous test to the patterns, pruning any nonsensical or
              un-necessary patterns. This pruning process can be quite CP
              intensive to the extent that it may have a deleterious effect on
              your system - thus the ability to disable it.

       -s Sites_directory
              Each site's ``groups'' and ``exclude'' file are located in a
              unique directory for each site. These site directories are
              located in the directory defined with this option. If this is
              given as a relative path then it will be relative to gup's home
              directory (see the -d option).  Gup will try and create this
              directory if it does not exist.

       -v     Print out the version number and various compile-time variables,
              then exit.

COMMANDS
       Gup scans the body of the mail for commands. Blank lines are ignored
       and any data after the ``#'' character is considered a comment. No
       continuation is allowed. Many of the commands accept a pattern as a
       parameter.  This pattern is identical to the format of the wildmat()
       pattern; see wildmat (3) ).  In fact, Gup purposely uses the wildmat
       routine from INN to ensure that the pattern matching characteristics
       are identical.

       Valid commands are:

       site sitename password
              This must be the first command in the mail.  sitename and
              password must match an entry in the ``config'' file.  Only one
              site command is allowed per mail. Aliases: "open" and "host".

       quit   This command stops gup from processing the rest of the mail.
              This is useful if your mail User Agent tends to automatically
              append a signature file to your mail. Alias: "q".

       include pattern
              The pattern is checked against the active file. If it matches at
              least one newsgroup, the pattern is placed at the end of the
              site's ``group'' file as an include entry.  Only one pattern per
              include command is allowed. If the pattern matches anything in
              the site's exclusion list (see EXCLUSIONS) then the include will
              fail.  Aliases: "+" and "inc".

       exclude pattern
              The pattern is checked against the active file. If it matches at
              least one newsgroup, the pattern is placed at the end of the
              site's ``group'' file as an exclude entry.  Only one pattern per
              exclude command is allowed.  Aliases: "-" and "exc".

       help   Generate a small help message that briefly describes each
              command.  There is an implied quit with the help command so
              there is no point in placing commands after the help command.
              Alias: "h".

       list   list all of the current include and exclude patterns in the
              sites ``groups'' file.  The output is in a format suitable for
              feeding back into gup at a later stage if need be.  Alias: "l".

       delete pattern
              Delete all include and exclude patterns in the site's ``groups''
              file that match the pattern.  ``delete *'' is an effective way
              of clearing all current patterns.

       newsgroups pattern
              This command lists out all available newsgroups from the active
              file that match the pattern.  The list includes the description
              from the newsgroups file as well as an indication if the site is
              currently subscribed to that group.  Only one pattern per
              newsgroups command is allowed.  Alias: "news".

PROCESSING
       Gup has a number of processing stages. The initialization stage
       consists of changing to the home directory (see the -d option) and
       opening the logfile (see the -l option). At this time, gup sets the
       tentative reply-to mail address to the ``backstop'' mail address
       defined when gup was compiled (typically the local news administrator).

       The next stage consists of scanning the inbound mail, noting
       interesting mail headers. The most interesting ones are "TO:" and
       "REPLY-TO:".  When a "TO:" header is found it becomes the tentative
       reply-to mail address. If a "REPLY-TO:" header is found it over-rides
       any "TO:" address to become the new tentative reply-to mail address.  A
       few others are noted and logged to help track changes.

       After all the headers have been processed, the body of the mail is
       examined for commands. The first command must be the site command. Any
       other data results in an error mail sent to the tentative reply-to mail
       address.  If the site command contains a name that matches an entry in
       the ``config'' file, then the tentative reply-to mail address is
       replaced with the mail address in the ``config'' file.

       The reason for these contortions with tentative reply-to mail addresses
       is simply to deal with the problem of working out who to send a mail to
       in the event of an error. Ideally they should all go back to the mail
       address in the ``config'' file, but that information is not known for
       quite a significant part of gup's initial processing.

       Once a valid site command has been accepted, gup changes to that site's
       directory in Sites_directory (see the -s option) making the
       Sites_directory and site's directory as necessary. The site's directory
       name is the same as the site's name. In the absence of the -s option
       this will be:

            $HOME/sites/$site

       Where $HOME is gup's home directory and $site is the name of the site
       being processed.  Gup locks the site then loads the site's current
       ``groups'' file and any xclusion list if present (see EXCLUSIONS for
       more details).

       From this point on gup accepts any command in any order until either
       the end of the mail, a quit command a help command or a serious error
       during processing.  After all commands have been processed, gup
       update's the site's ``groups'' file if changes have been made.  This
       update includes pruning any superfluous patterns (unless the -P option
       is used).  Gup writes the new patterns to ``groups.new''. It then
       renames ``groups'' to ``group.old'' and finally renames ``groups.new''
       to ``groups''.  The result of all this processing is mailed to the site
       administrator defined in the ``config'' file.

CONFIG
       Access to gup is controlled by the ``config'' file in gup's home
       directory (see the -d option).  This file contains one line per site.
       Each line contains three white-space separated tokens. The site's name,
       password and mail address of the administrator.  Blank lines are
       allowed and comments follow the ``#'' character.  Gup uses a very
       simple tokenizer, thus no quoting or continuation is allow in this
       file.

       The site name and password are used to check an inbound site command.
       The password is in plain-text so permissions should be carefully set to
       restrict access. Here's an example of a ``config'' file.

            werple    Fert5566a__$1  andrew@werple.apana.org.au
            torps     34fkr_&&11)Zz  zaph@torps.apana.org.au
            uunet     R_S_1@@*(A-\   news@uunet.uu.net
            .test     flapper        markd

       Hopefully this is intuitively obvious...

GROUPS
       Each site has it's own file of patterns. This file is called ``groups''
       and is located in the site's own directory below the Sites_directory
       (see the -s option).  This file contains one pattern per line.
       Exclusion lists have a preceding ``!'' character. Here's an example:

       apana.*
       !apana.lists.*
       !apana.fido.*
       !apana.vortex.*
       alt.bbs.waffle
       alt.cult-movies
       alt.galactic-guide
       alt.sport.bowling
       aus.*
       !aus.ai
       !aus.religion
       !aus.radio
       !aus.stats.s

       Normally this file should only be changed by gup, but assuming you
       cater for locking, there is no reason why some other process cannot
       change it too. Whenever gup has to apply changes, it renames this file
       to ``groups.old'' prior to re-writing the ``groups'' file. This gives
       you some measure of recovery.

EXCLUSIONS
       For whatever reason, you may wish to exclude particular groups from a
       site's selection list. You can do this by creating the file ``exclude''
       in the site's directory. This file contains newsgroup patterns, one per
       line, that are used to filter the ``active'' file when verifying group
       patterns. The effect of this is that gup believes that such groups do
       not really exist, therefore a site cannot possibly include them.

DIAGNOSTICS
       All error conditions are record in the log file and possibly the
       resultant mail - depending on the nature of the error. A particular
       problem that is hard to detect is when the .forward file invokes gup
       incorrectly. If is not invoked due to such an error, then notification
       depends on the mailer. This should only be a problem to watch out for
       when first installing gup.

RESTRICTIONS
       Gup does not understand ``Distribution patterns''. Any such patterns
       must be generated and maintained independently of gup.

BUGS
       Gup does not know when the popen(1) fails when Mail_command is invoked.
       This is a limitation of popen(1).  If the Mail_command is bogus, then
       the error will be pretty obscure and dependent on your mailer. stderr
       is redirected to the logfile prior to invoking the Mail_Command so
       hopefully /bin/sh (used by popen) has generated an appropriate message.
