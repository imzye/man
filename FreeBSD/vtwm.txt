NAME
       vtwm - Virtual Tab Window Manager for the X Window System

SYNTAX
       vtwm [-d display] [-f [initfile]] [-m [options]] [-p] [-s] [-v] [-V]

DESCRIPTION
       vtwm is a window manager for the X Window System.  It provides
       titlebars, shaped windows, several forms of icon management, user-
       defined macro functions, click-to-type and pointer-driven keyboard
       focus, and user-specified key and pointer button bindings.

       This program is usually started by the user's session manager or
       startup script.  When used from xdm(1) or xinit(1) without a session
       manager, vtwm is frequently executed in the foreground as the last
       client.  When run this way, exiting vtwm causes the session to be
       terminated (i.e., logged out).

       By default, application windows are surrounded by a border with a
       titlebar at the top.  The titlebar contains the window's name, a
       rectangular area that indicates when the window is receiving keyboard
       input, and three function boxes known as "titlebar buttons".  Pressing
       pointer Button1 (usually the left-most button unless it has been
       changed with xmodmap(1)) on any of these titlebar features will invoke
       the function associated with them.

       With the default interface, windows are iconified by clicking (pressing
       and then immediately releasing) the titlebar button that looks like a
       dot.  Conversely, windows are deiconified by clicking in the associated
       icon or entry in the icon manager (see the descriptions of the variable
       ShowIconManager and the function f.showiconmgr in the BINDINGS
       section).

       Windows are resized by pressing the titlebar button that resembles a
       group of nested squares, dragging the pointer over the edge that is to
       be moved, and releasing the pointer when the window is the desired
       size.  Similarly, windows are moved by pressing in the title or
       highlight area, dragging it to the new location, and then releasing
       when the window is in the desired position.  Just clicking in the title
       or highlight area raises the window without moving it.

       Pressing the titlebar button with the down arrow in it brings up a menu
       with many other functions that may be applied to the window.

       When new windows are created, vtwm will honor any size and location
       information requested by the user (usually through -geometry command
       line argument or X11 resources for the individual applications).  With
       the default configuration, Clicking pointer Button1 will position the
       window at the current position and give it the default size.  Pressing
       pointer Button2 (usually the middle pointer button) and dragging the
       window will give the window its current position but allow the sides to
       be resized as described above.  Clicking pointer Button3 (usually the
       right pointer button) will give the window its current position but
       attempt to make it long enough to touch the bottom of the screen.

       The default behavior during these operations is to represent the window
       with an outline of the client window and its titlebar, lines crossing
       within the client window.  Alternatively, vtwm may be configured to
       draw the window completely, but it is not recommended unless yours is a
       fast system.

THE VIRTUAL DESKTOP
       vtwm is based upon the twm(1) window manager, but adds extra
       functionality in the form of a virtual desktop.  The virtual desktop is
       an area larger than the physical screen. The real screen is considered
       to be a window onto portions of the virtual desktop showing whatever
       windows are present in that area of the desktop.   To help navigate
       around the desktop, vtwm creates a new window, of the name VTWM
       Desktop, which shows the entire desktop using a small scale.  In the
       Virtual Desktop window, all windows that exist are displayed and
       various options are provided to recognize the identity of the different
       windows (see the descriptions of the variables
       DesktopDisplayBackground, DesktopDisplayForeground,
       DesktopDisplayBorder and VirtualDesktopFont).

       To provide a consistent workspace, the option is provided of nailing
       windows onto the real screen.  When a window is nailed, it is
       considered stuck to the real screen no matter what part of the desktop
       is currently being displayed.

       Normally, a few standard utilities are nailed down: the icon manager,
       the desktop view, a load average chart, a clock, and a mail notifier.
       The f.nail (or its alias, f.stick) function can be used to change the
       nailed status of any window; see the BINDINGS section for details.

       The root window of the display is unchanged by this program and
       utilities such as xsetroot(1) will continue to work unmodified.

OPTIONS
       vtwm accepts the following command line options:

       -d display     This option specifies the X server to use.

       -f [initfile]  This option specifies the name of the startup file to
                      use.  By default, vtwm will look in the user's home
                      directory for files named .vtwmrc.N, .vtwmrc, .twmrc.N,
                      or .twmrc (where 'N' is a screen number).  It also looks
                      for system-wide default files; see the CUSTOMIZATION
                      section below for details. If initfile is not provided,
                      this specifies that vtwm should disregard any startup
                      files it finds, and use only the defaults that are
                      compiled in (intended for testing compiled-in defaults).

       -m [options]   This option causes vtwm to preprocess the startup file
                      using the m4(1) macro processor. The options will be
                      passed verbatim to m4 along with those symbols that vtwm
                      declares.  Note that options itself should be quoted, to
                      prevent unwanted processing that may occur by the shell,
                      etc.

       -p             This option indicates that vtwm should attempt to write
                      it's PID to $HOME/vtwm.pid on startup, and delete that
                      file on shutdown.  This file may be useful as a lock
                      file, or for determining the correct vtwm process for a
                      particular user.  If the file cannot be written on
                      startup, a bell will sound, but vtwm will continue.

       -s             This option indicates that only the default screen (as
                      specified by the -d option or by the DISPLAY environment
                      variable) should be managed.  By default, vtwm will
                      attempt to manage all screens on the display.

       -v             This option indicates that vtwm should print messages to
                      the stderr device when an unexpected event occurs.  This
                      can be be useful for debugging applications, but may be
                      distracting in regular use.

       -V             Show the version string and exit.

CUSTOMIZATION
       Much of vtwm's appearance and behavior can be controlled by providing a
       startup file in one of the following locations (searched in order for
       each screen being managed when vtwm begins):

       $HOME/.vtwmrc.screennumber
               The screennumber is a small positive number (e.g., 0, 1, etc.)
               representing the screen number (e.g., the last number in the
               DISPLAY environment variable host:displaynum.screennum) that
               would be used to contact that screen of the display.  This is
               intended for displays with multiple screens of differing visual
               types.

       $HOME/.vtwmrc
               This is the usual name for an individual user's startup file.

       $VTWMDIR/twm/system.vtwmrc
               If neither of the preceding files are found, vtwm will look in
               this file for a default configuration.  Note that the variable
               is defined only in the Makefile, and is often set and tailored
               by the site administrator to provide convenient menus or
               familiar bindings for novice users.

       $HOME/.twmrc.screennumber

       $HOME/.twmrc

       $VTWMDIR/twm/system.twmrc
               When none of the .vtwmrc files can be found, vtwm reverts to
               acting like twm(1), and searches for these three .twmrc
               variants.  Note that the variable is defined only in the
               Makefile.

       This search algorithm allows both twm(1) and vtwm to coexist peacefully
       at an installation.  Since vtwm is a superset of twm(1), it can even
       used to replace the latter, and users who have only a .twmrc-style file
       should not notice much difference.

       If no startup files are found, or if vtwm is told to ignore them, vtwm
       will use built-in defaults as described in the DESCRIPTION section
       above, though the system.vtwmrc file, if re-configured before the
       build, may intervene.  The only X11 resource used by vtwm is
       bitmapFilePath for a colon-separated list of directories to search when
       looking for bitmap and pixmap files (for more information, see the
       Athena Widgets manual and xrdb(1)).

       vtwm startup files are logically broken up into three types of
       specifications:  Variables, Bindings, Menus.

       The Variables section must come first and is used to describe the
       fonts, colors, cursors, border widths, icon and window placement,
       highlighting, autoraising, layout of titles, warping, and use of the
       icon manager.

       The Bindings section usually comes second and is used to specify the
       functions that should be to be invoked when keyboard and pointer
       buttons are pressed in windows, icons, titles, and frames.

       The Menus section gives any user-defined menus (containing functions to
       be invoked or commands to be executed).

       Variable names and keywords are case-insensitive.  Strings must be
       surrounded by double quote characters (e.g., "blue") and are case-
       sensitive.  A sharp sign ('#') outside of a string causes the remainder
       of the line in which the character appears to be treated as a comment.

M4 PREPROCESSING
       A powerful feature of vtwm as of version 5.4.6 is that it can use m4(1)
       to pre-process it's startup files.  When vtwm is started with -m, it
       will open a file for input as described above, but will process that
       file through m4 before parsing it.  So, you can use m4 macros to
       perform operations at runtime.  This makes it very easy to work when
       you use many different displays, etc.  For example, if you want to set
       the lower right section of the screen to be your IconRegion, you can
       use m4 directives and pre-defined symbols to calculate the region you
       want:
           define(IRegion, translit(eval(WIDTH/3)*eval(HEIGHT/2)+eval(WIDTH-WIDTH/3)-0, *, x))
           IconRegion  "IRegion" SOUTH EAST 75 25
       will define the lower half, and right-hand third of the screen.  The
       symbols WIDTH and HEIGHT are calculated by vtwm for m4 to use.  The
       following symbols are pre-defined by vtwm:

       SERVERHOST     This variable is set to the name of the machine that is
                      running the X server.

       CLIENTHOST     The machine that is running the X clients (i.e., "vtwm",
                      "xterm", etc.).

       HOSTNAME       The canonical hostname running the clients (i.e., a
                      fully-qualified version of CLIENTHOST).

       USER           The name of the user running the program.  Gotten from
                      the environment.

       HOME           The user's home directory.  Gotten from the environment.

       VERSION        The X major protocol version.  As seen by
                      ProtocolVersion().

       REVISION       The X minor protocol revision.  As seen by
                      ProtocolRevision().

       VENDOR         The vendor of your X server (i.e., "MIT X Consortium").

       RELEASE        The release number of your X server.  For MIT X11R5,
                      this is "5".

       WIDTH          The width of your display in pixels.

       HEIGHT         The height of your display in pixels.

       X_RESOLUTION   The X resolution of your display in pixels per meter.

       Y_RESOLUTION   The Y resolution of your display in pixels per meter.

       PLANES         The number of bit planes your display supports in the
                      default root window.

       BITS_PER_RGB   The number of significant bits in an RGB color.  (log
                      base 2 of the number of distinct colors that can be
                      created.  This is often different from the number of
                      colors that can be displayed at once.)

       TWM_TYPE       Tells which twm derivative is running.  It will always
                      be set to "vtwm" in this program.  This is useful for
                      protecting parts of your startup file that twm proper
                      won't understand (like VirtualDesktop) so that it is
                      still usable with other twm-based programs.

       CLASS          Your visual class.  Will return one of "StaticGray",
                      "GrayScale", "StaticColor", "PseudoColor", "TrueColor",
                      "DirectColor", or, if it cannot determine what you have,
                      "NonStandard".

       COLOR          This will be either "Yes" or "No".  This is just a
                      wrapper around the above definition.  Returns "Yes" on
                      "*Color", and "No" on "StaticGray" and "GrayScale".

       I18N           This will be either "Yes" or "No" depending on whether
                      support for internationalization has been compiled in.

       XPM            This will be either "Yes" or "No" depending on whether
                      support for pixmap image files has been compiled in.

       SOUND          This will be either "Yes" or "No" depending on whether
                      support for sound has been compiled in.

       REGEX          This will be either "Yes" or "No" depending on whether
                      support for regular expressions ("RE"s) has been
                      compiled in.

       Note that any symbols passed to m4 on the command line that conflict
       with these will not be anticipated or dealt with by vtwm; you will be
       at the mercy of your particular m4.

       Note also that if vtwm's preparation for executing m4 fails, the
       startup file will be processed normally, and will choke on the first m4
       macro encountered.

       Finally, be aware that m4 preprocessing can cause things often found in
       startup files to break.  For example, quotes and backquotes in shell
       commands will be badly messed up by m4's own internal quoting
       mechanism.  This particular problem can be worked around by placing
       changequote(,) at the top of your startup file.

       Invoking vtwm with both the -m and -v options will print the m4 command
       with all symbols expanded.

VARIABLES
       Many of the aspects of vtwm's user interface are controlled by
       variables that may be set in the user's startup file.  Some of the
       options are enabled or disabled simply by the presence of a particular
       keyword.  Other options require keywords, numbers, strings, or lists of
       all of these.

       Lists are surrounded by braces and are usually separated by whitespace
       or a newline.  For example:
           AutoRaise { "emacs" "VTWM*" "x*clock" "Xmh" "XTerm" }
       or
           AutoRaise
           {
               "emacs"
               "VTWM*"
               "x*clock"
               "Xmh"
               "XTerm"
           }

       When a variable containing a list of strings representing windows is
       searched (e.g., to determine whether or not to enable autoraise as
       shown above), a string must be a case-sensitive match to the window's
       name (given by the WM_NAME window property), or the class name or class
       class (both given by the WM_CLASS window property).  The preceding
       example would enable autoraise on windows named "emacs", all
       vtwm-specific windows, any clocks installed whose name starts with an
       'x' (asclock will not autoraise), and all xmh and xterm windows (which
       are of class "XTerm" and "Xmh", respectively).  See the WILDCARDS
       section for details on what the asterisks ('*') mean.

       String arguments that are interpreted as filenames (see the Pixmaps,
       Cursors, and IconDirectory variables below) will prepend the user's
       directory (specified by the HOME environment variable) if the first
       character is a tilde ('~').  If, instead, the first character is a
       colon (':'), the name is assumed to refer to one of the internal
       bitmaps that are used to create 2D titlebar buttons, the 2D icon
       manager button, and the 2D menu pull-right icon.  Finally, if the first
       five characters are ":xpm:", the name is assumed to refer to one of the
       built-in pixmaps that can used to create 3D titlebar buttons, the 3D
       icon manager button, and the 3D menu pull-right icon.  See the IMAGE
       AND AUDIO FORMATS section for further details.

       The following variables may be specified in the vtwm startup file.
       Lists of window names are indicated by win-list, and optional arguments
       are shown in square brackets. Any default values are based on the
       distributed system.vtwmrc files, and if none is mentioned, the default
       setting is "off", "disabled", or "none".

       AppletRegion geomstr vgrav hgrav hgrid vgrid { win-list }
              This variable specifies an area on the root window in which the
              windows listed in win-list are placed.  The geomstr is a quoted
              string containing a standard geometry specification for the
              region size and location.  If more than one AppletRegion is
              specified, windows will be put into succeeding regions that have
              the window listed when the first is full.  The vgrav argument
              should be either North or South and is used to control whether
              windows are first filled in from the top or bottom of the
              region.  Similarly, the hgrav argument should be either East or
              West and is used to control whether windows should be filled in
              from the left or right.  Windows are laid out in a grid with
              cells hgrid pixels wide and vgrid pixels high.  Note that the
              smallest dimension of the region must be at least the size of
              the largest window in it, including frame and titlebar, in the
              same direction.  This variable is intended to simplify
              management of all those little tool applications like xcb(1),
              xbiff(1), xload(1), etc. that are used regularly.

       AutoPan N
               This variable allows the screen to automatically pan by N% of a
               real screen when the pointer approaches the edge of the screen.
               The pan will be in the direction of the edge approached. The
               default is 100, effectively "paging" across the virtual
               desktop.

       AutoPanBorderWidth pixels
               If AutoPan is turned on, when the pointer goes within the
               specified number of pixels of the real screen's border, the
               screen is panned.  The default value is 5.

       AutoPanExtraWarp pixels
               If AutoPan is turned on and NaturalAutopanBehavior turned off,
               this variable specifies how far, in pixels, you want the
               pointer to move away from the inner edge of the autopan border
               when autopanning.  The default value is 2 pixels.

       AutoPanWarpWithRespectToRealScreen N
               With this option turned on, the pointer is warped by N% as many
               pixels on the real screen as the screen is scrolled, or by
                   (AutoPanBorderWidth + AutoPanExtraWarp)
               pixels, whichever is greater.  See NaturalAutopanBehavior for a
               more thorough discussion of this and some recommended settings.

       AutoRaise [{ win-list }]
               This variable specifies a list of windows (all windows if win-
               list is omitted) to be automatically raised whenever the
               pointer has come to rest in a window for the amount of time
               specified by the RaiseDelay variable.  This action can be
               interactively enabled or disabled on individual windows using
               the function f.autoraise.

       AutoRaiseDelay milliseconds
               A synonym for RaiseDelay.

       AutoRelativeResize
               This variable indicates that dragging out a window size (either
               when initially sizing the window with pointer Button2 or when
               resizing it) should not wait until the pointer has crossed the
               window edges.  Instead, moving the pointer automatically causes
               the nearest edge or edges to move by the same amount.  This
               allows the resizing windows that extend off the edge of the
               screen.  If the pointer is in the center of the window, or if
               the resize is begun by pressing a titlebar button, vtwm will
               still wait for the pointer to cross a window edge (to prevent
               accidents).  This option is particularly useful for people who
               like the press-drag-release method of sweeping out window
               sizes.

       AutoResizeKeepOnScreen
               This variables indicates that if a window is fully on-screen
               when a programmatic (non-user-initiated) resize occurs, that if
               at all possible the window should be onsize after the resize
               has completed.

       BeNiceToColormap
               This variable specifies that stippled lines be used for the
               bevel colors when any of the 3D variables are set, to conserve
               on colormap allocations.

       BorderBevelWidth pixels
               Tells vtwm to use 3D-looking window borders, and specifies the
               width in pixels of the bevel. The color of the 3D border is
               BorderTileBackground, and if NoHighlight is not selected, the
               border of the Focus window is BorderColor.  The default is 0 if
               vtwm is built with 2D features, or 2 when vtwm is built with 3D
               features.

       BorderColor string [{ wincolorlist }]
               This variable specifies the default color of the border to be
               placed around all non-iconified windows, and may only be given
               within a Color or Monochrome list.  The optional wincolorlist
               specifies a list of window and color name pairs for specifying
               particular border colors for different types of windows.  For
               example:
                   BorderColor    "gray50"
                   {
                       "XTerm"    "red"
                       "xmh"      "green"
                   }

               The default is "gray70".

       BorderTileBackground string [{ wincolorlist }]
               This variable specifies the default background color in the
               gray pattern used in unhighlighted borders (only if NoHighlight
               hasn't been set), and may only be given within a Color or
               Monochrome list.  The optional wincolorlist allows per-window
               colors to be specified.  The default is "gray60".

       BorderTileForeground string [{ wincolorlist }]
               This variable specifies the default foreground color in the
               gray pattern used in unhighlighted borders (only if NoHighlight
               hasn't been set), and may only be given within a Color or
               Monochrome list.  The optional wincolorlist allows per-window
               colors to be specified.  The default is "gray60".

       BorderWidth pixels
               This variable specifies the width in pixels of the border
               surrounding all client window frames if ClientBorderWidth has
               not been specified.  This value is also used to set the border
               size of windows created by vtwm (such as the icon manager).
               The default is 2 if vtwm is built with 2D features, or 6 when
               vtwm is built with 3D features.

       ButtonBevelWidth pixels
               Tells vtwm to use 3D-looking window buttons. It specifies the
               width in pixels of the bevel.  The default is 0 if vtwm is
               built with 2D features, or 1 when vtwm is built with 3D
               features.

       ButtonIndent pixels
               This variable specifies the size of titlebar buttons, expressed
               as a difference from the titlebar font height, and normally
               means that titlebar buttons will shrink (built-in images) or be
               cropped (external images) accordingly.  A negative value is
               accepted, however, indicating that titlebar buttons should be
               larger than the titlebar font. Setting this to a negated
               FramePadding value, with TitleButtonBorderWidth set to 0, makes
               titlebar buttons as tall and wide as possible. The default is 0
               if vtwm is built with with 2D features, or -2 when vtwm is
               built with 3D features.  (Note that there is an implicit 2
               pixel adjustment when built when 3D features, meaning the -2
               specified above would adjust to a zero pixel indention and a
               value of 2 would mean a four pixel indention).

       ButtonColorIsFrame
               This variable specifies that the titlebar buttons will be the
               same color as the window frame. It is set by default if vtwm is
               built with 3D features.

       ClearBevelContrast contrast
               Indicates to vtwm how to calculate the clear bevel color for 3D
               items.  The value is a compressed to the range 0 and 100. The
               formula used is:
                   clear.{RGB} = (65535 - color.{RGB}) * (contrast / 100)

               The default is 40 if vtwm is built with 3D features.

       ClientBorderWidth
               This variable indicates that width of a window's frame should
               be set to the border width as specified by the client, rather
               than to the value of BorderWidth. If BorderBevelWidth is non-
               zero, however, this variable is ignored.

       Color { colors-list }
               This variable specifies a list of color assignments to be made
               if the default display is capable of displaying more than
               simple black and white.  The colors-list is made up of the
               following color variables and their values: DefaultBackground,
               DefaultForeground, MenuBackground, MenuForeground,
               MenuTitleBackground, MenuTitleForeground, and MenuShadowColor.
               The following color variables may also be given a list of
               window and color name pairs to allow per-window colors to be
               specified (see BorderColor for details): BorderColor,
               DesktopDisplayForeground, DesktopDisplayBackground,
               RealScreenForeground, RealScreenBackground, VirtualForeground,
               VirtualBackground, DekstopDisplayBorder, IconManagerHighlight,
               BorderTileBackground, BorderTileForeground, TitleBackground,
               TitleForeground, IconBackground, IconForeground,
               IconBorderColor, IconManagerBackground, and
               IconManagerForeground.  For example:
                   Color
                   {
                       MenuBackground     "gray50"
                       MenuForeground     "blue"
                       BorderColor        "red"
                       {
                           "XTerm"        "yellow"
                       }
                       TitleForeground    "yellow"
                       TitleBackground    "blue"
                   }

               All of these color variables may also be specified for the
               Monochrome variable, allowing the same initialization file to
               be used on both color and monochrome displays.

       ConstrainedMoveTime milliseconds
               This variable specifies the length of time between button
               clicks needed to begin a constrained move operation. Double
               clicking within this amount of time when invoking f.move will
               cause the window only to be moved in a horizontal or vertical
               direction.  Setting this value to 0 will disable constrained
               moves.  The default is 400 milliseconds.

       Cursors { cursor-list }
               This variable specifies the glyphs that vtwm should use for
               various pointer cursors.  Each cursor may be defined either
               from the cursor font or from two bitmap files.  Shapes from the
               cursor font may be specified directly as:
                   cursorname    "string"
               where cursorname is one of the cursor names listed below, and
               string is the name of a glyph as found in the file
               /usr/include/X11/cursorfont.h (without the "XC_" prefix).  If
               the cursor is to be defined from bitmap files, the following
               syntax is used instead:
                   cursorname    "image"    "mask"
               where image and mask specify the names of files containing the
               glyph image and mask in bitmap(1) form.  The bitmap files are
               located in the same manner as icon bitmap files.  The following
               example shows the default cursor definitions:
                   Cursors
                   {
                       Frame      "top_left_arrow"
                       Title      "top_left_arrow"
                       Window     "top_left_arrow"
                       Icon       "top_left_arrow"
                       IconMgr    "top_left_arrow"
                       Move       "fleur"
                       Resize     "fleur"
                       Menu       "sb_left_arrow"
                       Button     "hand2"
                       Wait       "watch"
                       Select     "dot"
                       Destroy    "pirate"
                       Door       "exchange"
                       Virtual    "rtl_logo"
                       Desktop    "dotbox"
                   }

               Note: if the client provides a cursor glyph for its top-level
               window, that one is used instead of the value specified by
               Window above.

       DarkBevelContrast contrast
               Indicates to vtwm has to calculate the dark bevel color for 3D
               items.  The value is a comprised between 0 and 100. The formula
               used is:
                   dark.{RGB} = color.{RGB} * ((100 - contrast) / 100)

               The default is 40 if vtwm is built with 3D features.

       DecorateTransients
               This variable indicates that transient windows (those
               containing a WM_TRANSIENT_FOR property) should have titlebars.
               By default, transients are not reparented.

       DefaultBackground string
               This variable specifies the background color to be used for
               sizing and information windows.  The default is "maroon" for
               color displays or "gray50" for monochrome displays.

       DefaultFont string
               This variable specifies the font to use if loading some other
               font fails for some reason. The default is "fixed".

       DefaultForeground string
               This variable specifies the foreground color to be used for
               sizing and information windows.  The default is "gray85".

       DeiconifyToScreen
               When deiconifying a window, by default, the window will be
               placed at its previous geometry in the virtual desktop. With
               this variable set, vtwm ensures that the window will be placed
               somewhere on the real screen.

       DesktopDisplayBackground color [{ win-list }]
               This variable sets the backgrounds of the little windows inside
               the Virtual Desktop window, AND it sets the backgrounds of menu
               entries in the VTWM Windows menu -- unless you specify
               OldFashionedVtwmWindowsMenu.  The default color is used for the
               default background of windows not named in the list.  The
               optional win-list is a list of window names and colors, for
               example:
                   DesktopDisplayBackground    "purple"
                   {
                       "zwgc"                  "green"
                   }

               The default is "gray60".

       DesktopDisplayBorder color [{ win-list }]
               This variable sets the border color in the virtual desktop
               representation window to color.  The win-list is in the same
               format as TitleForeground and other similar variables.
                   DesktopDisplayBorder    "black"
                   {
                       "zwgc"              "green"
                   }

               The default is "black".

       DesktopDisplayForeground color [{ win-list }]
               If both this and the VirtualDesktopFont variable are set, then
               the names of the windows will be written in the window
               representations shown in the desktop.  This entry also sets
               foreground colors for entries in the VTWM Windows menu.  The
               format of this variable is the same as that used for
               DesktopDisplayBackground.  The default is "gray85".

       DontDeiconifyTransients
               This variable sees that iconified transient windows of an
               iconified parent window aren't deiconified when that parent is,
               thus preserving their state.  Default behavior is to deiconify
               all transient subwindows of the ancestor window when it is
               deiconified.

       DontIconifyByUnmapping { win-list }
               This variable specifies a list of windows that should not be
               iconified by simply unmapping the window (as would be the case
               if IconifyByUnmapping had been set).  This is frequently used
               to force some windows to be treated as icons while other
               windows are handled by the icon manager.

       DontInterpolateTitles
               This variable specifies a modification to the
               InterpolateMenuColors behavior.  It will cause vtwm to not
               apply color interpolation to any titles in the middle of the
               menu.  So, f.title strings that appear in the middle of the
               menu (ie, without a specific color defined for them) will
               inherit the default MenuTitle foreground and background colors.

       DontMoveOff
               This variable indicates that windows should not be allowed to
               be moved off the screen.  It can be overridden by the
               f.forcemove function.

       DontShowInDisplay { list }
               This variable specifies a list of clients that should not
               appear in the desktop display.  The default is:
                   DontShowInDisplay
                   {
                       "VTWM *"
                       "xclock"
                       "xload"
                   }

       DontShowInTwmWindows { list }

       DontShowInVtwmWindows { list }
               These variables specify a list of clients that should not
               appear in the VTWM Windows menu.

       DontSqueezeTitle [{ win-list }]
               This variable indicates that titlebars should not be squeezed
               to their minimum size as described under SqueezeTitle below.
               If the optional window list is supplied, only those windows
               will be prevented from being squeezed.

       DoorBackground color [{ door-list }]
               Specifies background colors of doors. The default is "maroon"
               for color displays or "gray50" for monochrome displays.

       DoorBevelWidth pixels
               Tells vtwm to use 3D-looking doors, and specifies the width in
               pixels of the bevel. The default is 0 if vtwm is built with 2D
               features, or 1 when vtwm is built with 3D features.

       DoorFont string
               This variable specifies the font to be used for text in doors.
               This must be set in order to see the doors.  The default is
               "-adobe-helvetica-bold-r-normal--*-100-*-*-*-*-*-*".

       DoorForeground color [{ door-list }]
               Specifies foreground colors of doors. The default is "gray85".

       Doors { door-list }
               This variable is used to create doors, which are teleports.
               Each item in the door-list has the following format:
                   "winname"    "location"    "jumpTo"

               Windows with the name winname appear with size and position as
               defined in location (for extended geometry specification see
               IconManagerGeometry), and warp the user to jumpTo when
               f.enterdoor is executed inside them.  Doors have a class of
               "VTWM Door".

       EnableXftFontRenderer
               This variable indicates that instead of the X11 core font
               renderer the Xft truetype font engine is to be used if
               available.  For details see the Xft NOTES section below.

       EnhancedExecResources
               By default, f.exec variables behaved as they always did in
               vtwm.  You would have to append " &" to all of your variables
               in order to execute them without blocking the window manager.
               With this option turned on, you don't have to; vtwm will
               automatically append " &" to the f.exec variable unless the
               last non-space character is either '&' or (in case you still
               want a command to block the window manager) ';'. For example,
               in a variable such as:
                   f.exec "foo; bar; baz"
               the window manager will be blocked so that "foo" and "bar" can
               be executed; "baz" is the only command which will NOT block the
               window manager.  If you want all these commands to be
               backgrounded, try the following:
                   f.exec "{ foo; bar; baz }" # note that "{" and "}"
                                              # are shell keywords; they
                                              # MUST be separated by
                                              # spaces.

               If you still want a command to block the window manager, you
               would use:
                   f.exec "xset fp rehash;" # vtwm will not append " &"
                                            # because ';' is the last
                                            # non-space character.

               This behavior was inspired by that of vuewm(1), Hewlett-
               Packard's workspace implementation of mwm(1).

       FixManagedVirtualGeometries

       FixTransientVirtualGeometries
               These are bug workarounds that *should* fix the way most
               windows' virtual geometries are handled i.e., they should be on
               the real screen if the parent windows are on the real screen,
               no matter where the virtual desktop is (xv(1) is one example of
               how these don't work).  This only take affect (and thus may be
               needed) if and only if you have NotVirtualGeometries set.

       ForceIcons
               This variable indicates that icon image files specified in the
               Icons variable should override any client-supplied images.

       FramePadding pixels
               This variable specifies the distance between the titlebar font
               or the titlebar button height, whichever is greater, and the
               window frame, enlarging the titlebar as required. See also
               ButtonIndent, for how it influences the titlebar. The default
               is 2 pixels.

       IconBackground string [{ win-list }]
               This variable specifies the background color of icons, and may
               only be specified inside of a Color or Monochrome list.  The
               optional win-list is a list of window names and colors so that
               per-window colors may be specified.  See the BorderColor
               variable for a complete description of the win-list.  The
               default is "maroon" for color displays or "gray50" for
               monochrome displays.

       IconBevelWidth pixels
               Tells vtwm to use 3D-looking icons, and specifies the width in
               pixels of the bevel.  The default is 0 if vtwm is built with 2D
               features, or 2 when vtwm is built with 3D features.

       IconBorderColor string [{ win-list }]
               This variable specifies the color of the border used for icon
               windows, and may only be specified inside of a Color or
               Monochrome list.  The optional win-list is a list of window
               names and colors so that per-window colors may be specified.
               See the BorderColor variable for a complete description of the
               win-list.  The default is "gray85".

       IconBorderWidth pixels
               This variable specifies the width in pixels of the border
               surrounding icon windows.  The default is 2 if vtwm is built
               with 2D features, or 0 when vtwm is built with 3D features.

       IconDirectory string
               This variable specifies the directory that should be searched
               if an image file cannot be found in any of the directories in
               the bitmapFilePath variable.

       IconFont string
               This variable specifies the font to be used to display icon
               names within icons.  The default is "-adobe-helvetica-bold-r-
               normal--*-100-*-*-*-*-*-*".

       IconForeground string [{ win-list }]
               This variable specifies the foreground color to be used when
               displaying icons, and may only be specified inside of a Color
               or Monochrome list.  The optional win-list is a list of window
               names and colors so that per-window colors may be specified.
               See the BorderColor variable for a complete description of the
               win-list.  The default is "gray85".

       IconifyByUnmapping [{ win-list }]
               This variable indicates that windows should be iconified by
               being unmapped without trying to map any icons.  If the
               optional win-list is provided, only those windows will be
               iconified by simply unmapping.  Windows that have both this and
               the IconManagerDontShow options set may not be accessible
               unless the user has provided bindings to the warp functions
               (f.warp and the like) while WarpUnmapped is set, or by the VTWM
               Windows menu.  It is set by default.

       IconManagerBackground string [{ win-list }]
               This variable specifies the background color to use for icon
               manager entries, and may only be specified inside of a Color or
               Monochrome list.  The optional win-list is a list of window
               names and colors so that per-window colors may be specified.
               See the BorderColor variable for a complete description of the
               win-list.  The default is "maroon" for color displays or
               "gray50" for monochrome displays.

       IconManagerBevelWidth pixels
               Tells vtwm to use 3D-looking icon manager entries, and
               specifies the width in pixels of their bevels.  The default is
               0 if vtwm is built with 2D features, or 1 when vtwm is built
               with 3D features.

       IconManagerDontShow [{ win-list }]
               This variable indicates that the icon manager should not
               display any windows.  If the optional win-list is given, only
               those windows will not be displayed.  This variable is used to
               prevent windows that are rarely iconified (such as xclock or
               xload) from taking up space in the icon manager.  The default
               is:
                   IconManagerDontShow
                   {
                       "VTWM *"
                       "xclock"
                       "xload"
                   }

       IconManagerFont string
               This variable specifies the font to be used when displaying
               icon manager entries.  The default is "-adobe-helvetica-bold-r-
               normal--*-100-*-*-*-*-*-*".

       IconManagerForeground string [{ win-list }]
               This variable specifies the foreground color to be used when
               displaying icon manager entries, and may only be specified
               inside of a Color or Monochrome list.  The optional win-list is
               a list of window names and colors so that per-window colors may
               be specified.  See the BorderColor variable for a complete
               description of the win-list.  The default is "gray85".

       IconManagerGeometry string [ columns ]
               This variable indicates that a default icon manager is to be
               created, with the geometry specified with string. The string
               argument should be a standard X geometry specification
               "WxH+X+Y", specifying the initial size and/or location.  The
               icon manager window is then broken into columns pieces and
               scaled according to the number of entries in the icon manager.
               Extra entries are wrapped to form additional rows.  The default
               string is "+0+0", and the default columns is 1.

               The geometry specification may include an extra parameter @P
               appended as in WxH+X+Y@P to denote the Xinerama or Xrandr panel
               (or a rectangular area) as the origin for the denoted geometry.
               Valid values for P include absolute panel indices as positive
               integers (or alphanumeric Xinerama or Xrandr output connector
               names, e.g.  Xinerama0, Xinerama1, LVDS, VGA, TMDS-1, TV, etc.)
               and dynamic indices denoted by keywords pointer, next and prev
               specifying the panel (resp. the next or previous one)
               containing the mouse.  The special keyword all is an alias for
               the X11 logical screen at full size (use with care in 'non-
               wall' panel arrangements).  Further, current denotes the
               maximum rectangular visible area spanned across panels
               intersected by the standard part WxH+X+Y (which is then
               considered relative to all) of the geometry specification.  If
               the extended parameter @P is missing, @current is assumed.

       IconManagerHighlight string [{ win-list }]
               This variable specifies the border color to be used when
               highlighting the icon manager entry that currently has the
               focus, and can only be specified inside of a Color or
               Monochrome list.  The optional win-list is a list of window
               names and colors so that per-window colors may be specified.
               See the BorderColor variable for a complete description of the
               win-list.  The default is "black".

       IconManagers { iconmgr-list }
               This variable specifies a list of icon managers to create, in
               addition to the default icon manager if IconManagerGeometry is
               used.  Each item in the iconmgr-list has the following format:
                   "winname"    ["iconname"]    "geometry"    columns
               where winname is the name of the windows that should be put
               into this icon manager, iconname is the name of that icon
               manager window's icon, geometry is an extended geometry
               specification, and columns is the number of columns in this
               icon manager as described in IconManagerGeometry.  For example:
                   IconManagers
                   {
                       "XTerm"     "300x5+800+5"    5
                       "myhost"    "400x5+100+5"    2
                   }

               Clients whose name or class is "XTerm" will have an entry
               created in the "XTerm" icon manager.  Clients whose name was
               "myhost" would be put into the "myhost" icon manager.

       IconManagerShow { win-list }
               This variable specifies a list of windows that should appear in
               the icon manager.  When used in conjunction with the
               IconManagerDontShow variable, only the windows in this list
               will be shown in the icon manager.  By default, all windows are
               shown except those in IconManagerDontShow.

       IconOpacity value
               This integer value (in range 0...255 corresponding to
               transparent...opaque) is used to set the _NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY
               property for the iconmanager and icons windows accordingly
               (allowing window semitransparency by e.g. xcompmgr by
               FreeDesktop.org and the Xorg X server Xcomposite extension).
               Default value is 255.

       IconRegion geomstr vgrav hgrav hgrid vgrid
               This variable specifies an area on the root window in which
               icons are placed if no specific icon location is provided by
               the client.  The geomstr is a quoted string containing an
               extended geometry specification (see IconManagerGeometry) for
               the region size and location.  If more than one IconRegion line
               is given, icons will be put into the succeeding regions when
               the first is full.  The vgrav argument should be either North
               or South and is used to control whether icons are first filled
               in from the top or bottom of the region.  Similarly, the hgrav
               argument should be either East or West and is used to control
               whether icons should be filled in from the left or right.
               Icons are laid out in a grid with cells hgrid pixels wide and
               vgrid pixels high.  Note that the smallest dimension of the
               region must be at least the size of the largest icon in it in
               the same direction.  Note also that many applications change
               their icon name as they run, and no provision is made to
               reformat the icon regions if any icon changes size accordingly.

       Icons { win-list }
               This variable specifies a list of window names and the image
               filenames that should be used as their icons.  For example:
                   Icons
                   {
                       "XTerm"    "xterm.icon"
                       "xfd"      "xfd_icon"
                   }

               Windows that match "XTerm" and would not be iconified by
               unmapping, and would try to use the icon image in the file
               "xterm.icon".  If ForceIcons is specified, this image will be
               used even if the client has requested its own icon image.

       IgnoreModifiers modlist
               This variable specifies the "shift states" to ignore when
               determining if an event is bound by vtwm. In this example:
                   IgnoreModifiers    l | m2
               the CapsLock and NumLock states will be ignored. Note that the
               use of this variable can generate quite a bit of X protocol
               network traffic; modlist should be kept as small as possible.
               See also the BINDINGS section.

       Immutable { win-list }
               This variable specifies a list of windows which can not be
               moved or resized.  For example:
                   Immutable
                   {
                       "VTWM Icon Manager"
                       "VTWM Desktop"
                       "xclock"
                       "xload"
                   }

       InfoBevelWidth pixels
               Tells vtwm to use 3D-looking identify, move and resize windows,
               and specifies the width in pixels of the bevel.  The default is
               0 if vtwm is built with 2D features, or 2 when vtwm is built
               with 3D features.

       InfoFont string
               This variable specifies the font to be used for in the identify
               window.  The default is "-adobe-helvetica-bold-r-
               normal--*-100-*-*-*-*-*-*".

       InterpolateMenuColors
               This variable indicates that menu entry colors should be
               interpolated between entry specified colors.  In this example:
                   Menu    "mymenu"
                   {
                       "Title"     ("black":"red")      f.title
                       "entry1"                         f.nop
                       "entry2"                         f.nop
                       "entry3"    ("white":"green")    f.nop
                       "entry4"                         f.nop
                       "entry5"    ("red":"white")      f.nop
                   }
               the foreground colors for "entry1" and "entry2" will be
               interpolated between black and white, and the background colors
               between red and green.  Similarly, the foreground for "entry4"
               will be half-way between white and red, and the background will
               be half-way between green and white.

       LessRandomZoomZoom
               With this option turned on, this makes random zooms a bit less
               "random" and a bit more visible.  This might make a better
               visual bell, depending on your personal taste.

       MakeTitle { win-list }
               This variable specifies a list of windows on which a titlebar
               should be placed and is used to request titles on specific
               windows when NoTitle has been set.

       MaxWindowSize string
               This variable specifies a geometry in which the width and
               height give the maximum size for a given window.  This is
               typically used to restrict windows to the size of the screen.
               The default is "30000x30000".

       MenuBackground string
               This variable specifies the background color used for menus,
               and can only be specified inside of a Color or Monochrome list.
               The default is "maroon" for color displays or "gray50" for
               monochrome displays.

       MenuBevelWidth pixels
               Tells vtwm to use 3D-looking menus, and specifies the width in
               pixels of the bevel.  The default is 0 if vtwm is built with 2D
               features, or 2 when vtwm is built with 3D features.

       MenuFont string
               This variable specifies the font to use when displaying menus.
               The default is "-adobe-helvetica-bold-r-
               normal--*-120-*-*-*-*-*-*".

       MenuForeground string
               This variable specifies the foreground color used for menus,
               and can only be specified inside of a Color or Monochrome list.
               The default is "gray85".

       MenuOpacity value
               This integer value (in range 0...255 corresponding to
               transparent...opaque) is used to set the _NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY
               property for the vtwm menu-, info-, virtual desktop and door
               windows accordingly (allowing window semitransparency by e.g.
               xcompmgr by FreeDesktop.org and the Xorg X server Xcomposite
               extension).  Default value is 255.

       MenuScrollBorderWidth pixels
               When the contents of a menu would make it taller than the
               display, moving the pointer within pixels of the top or bottom
               of the menu causes it to scroll the entries.  The default value
               is 2.

       MenuScrollJump entries
               This variable specifies the number of entries to scroll when
               the pointer is moved within the area defined by
               MenuScrollBorderWidth.  The default is 3 entries.

       MenuShadowColor string
               This variable specifies the color of the shadow behind pull-
               down menus and can only be specified inside of a Color or
               Monochrome list.  The default is "black".

       MenuTitleBackground string
               This variable specifies the background color for f.title
               entries in menus, and can only be specified inside of a Color
               or Monochrome list.  The default is "gray70".

       MenuTitleFont string
               This variable specifies the font to be used in menu titles.
               The default is "-adobe-helvetica-bold-r-
               normal--*-120-*-*-*-*-*-*".

       MenuTitleForeground string
               This variable specifies the foreground color for f.title
               entries in menus and can only be specified inside of a Color or
               Monochrome list.  The default is "maroon" for color displays or
               "gray50" for monochrome displays.

       Monochrome { colors }
               This variable specifies a list of color assignments that should
               be made if the screen has a depth of 1.  See the description of
               Colors.

       MoveDelta pixels
               This variable specifies the number of pixels the pointer must
               move before the f.move and f.resize functions and initial menu
               highlighting starts working.  See also the f.deltastop
               function.  The default is 3 pixels.

       NailedAbove
               This variable causes nailed windows to be physically above non-
               nailed windows.  The f.nailedabove function can be used to
               toggle this setting.

       NailedDown { list }
               This variable gives a list of clients that are nailed
               initially.  The default is:
                   NailedDown
                   {
                       "VTWM *"
                       "xclock"
                       "xload"
                   }

       NaturalAutopanBehavior
               By default, when autopanning, the pointer is warped by only
                   (AutoPanBorderWidth + AutoPanExtraWarp)
               pixels on the real screen.  With this option turned on, the
               pointer is warped on the real screen by as many pixels as the
               screen is scrolled, or the above value, whichever is greater.
               Thus, the pointer does not normally move very much (only by
               AutoPanExtraWarp) in relation to the virtual desktop.

               This works really well on faster X terminals and workstations,
               although for slower ones, you may want to use the following:
                   AutoPanWarpWithRespectToRealScreen    50
               to achieve a similar effect.  Setting NaturalAutopanBehavior
               has the exact same effect as using the variable
                   AutoPanWarpWithRespectToRealScreen    100

       NoBackingStore
               This variable indicates that vtwm's windows should not request
               backing store to minimize repainting.  This is typically used
               with servers that can repaint faster than they can handle
               backing store.

       NoBorder [{ win-list }]
               This variable indicates that windows should not have borders.
               If the optional win-list is given, only those windows will not
               have borders.

       NoBorderDecorations
               This variable indicates that the 3D borders of titled windows
               should not have the little divots adorning the corners.

       NoCaseSensitive
               This variable indicates that case should be ignored when
               sorting icon names in an icon manager.  This option is
               typically used with applications that capitalize the first
               letter of their icon name.

       NoDefaultMouseOrKeyboardBindings
               This variable indicates that vtwm should not supply the default
               pointer and keyboard bindings.  This option should only be used
               if the startup file contains a completely new set of pointer
               and keyboard bindings and definitions.  See also NoDefaults.

       NoDefaults
               This variable indicates that vtwm should not supply the default
               titlebar buttons and bindings.  This option should only be used
               if the startup file contains a completely new set of bindings
               and definitions.  This function has the effect of setting both
               NoDefaultMouseOrKeyboardBindings and NoDefaultTitleButtons.

       NoDefaultTitleButtons
               This variable indicates that vtwm should not supply the default
               titlebar buttons.  This option should only be used if the
               startup file contains a completely new set of titlebar button
               definitions.  See also NoDefaults.

       NoGrabServer
               This variable indicates that vtwm should minimize server grabs
               when popping up menus and moving or resizing windows.

       NoHighlight [{ win-list }]
               This variable indicates that borders should not be highlighted
               to track the location of the pointer.  If the optional win-list
               is given, highlighting will only be disabled for those windows.
               When the border is highlighted, it will be drawn in the current
               BorderColor.  When the border is not highlighted, it will be
               stippled with an gray pattern using the current
               BorderTileForeground and BorderTileBackground colors.  It is
               set by default if vtwm is built with 3D features.

       NoIconManagerFocus
               This variable indicates that vtwm should not set focus to
               windows corresponding to their entries in an icon manager.
               Normally, vtwm sets the focus so that events from an icon
               manager are delivered to the application.  Typically, this is
               set to facilitate icon manager bindings that would otherwise be
               delivered to the application.

       NoIconManagerHighlight
               This variable indicates that icon manager entries will not be
               highlighted to track the location of the pointer. This is
               independant of the NoHighlight variable.

       NoIconManagers
               This variable indicates that no icon manager should be created.

       NoIconifyIconManagers
               This variable indicates that no icon manager should be
               iconified.

       NoMenuShadows
               This variable indicates that menus should not have drop shadows
               drawn behind them.  This is typically used with slower servers
               since it speeds up menu drawing at the expense of making the
               menu slightly harder to read.

       NoOpaqueMove [{ win-list }]

       NoOpaqueResize [{ win-list }]
               These variables indicate that the f.move and f.resize functions
               should change just a window's outline.  If the optional win-
               list is given, only those windows will be affected. These are
               usually used to narrow the scope of "global" OpaqueMove and
               OpaqueResize variables.

       NoPrettyTitles
               If you don't mind long titles butting up against the right edge
               of short titlebars and icon managers. Disables the default
               behavior of using ellipses to indicate a truncated title.

       NoRaiseOnDeiconify

       NoRaiseOnMove

       NoRaiseOnResize

       NoRaiseOnWarp
               These variables indicate that windows should not be raised
               after a deiconify, move, resize, or warp operation, and are
               typically used to preserve the window stacking order. Note that
               the pointer may end up in an occluding window when these
               variables are used.

       NoSaveUnders
               This variable indicates that menus should not request save-
               unders to minimize window repainting following menu selection.
               It is typically used with displays that can repaint faster than
               they can handle save-unders.

       NoStackMode [{ win-list }]
               This variable indicates that client window requests to change
               stacking order should be ignored.  If the optional win-list is
               given, only requests on those windows will be ignored.  This is
               typically used to prevent applications from relentlessly
               popping themselves to the front of the window stack.

       NoStormPositioning
               This variable indicates that during a "storm" of window
               creation by a single application which uses window groups,
               instead of overriding the default window positioning code (e.g.
               random, user selected, pointer placement, etc) and placing
               newer windows on top of older windows, let the normal window
               positioning methods run.

       NoTitle [{ win-list }]
               This variable indicates that windows should not have titlebars.
               If the optional win-list is given, only those windows will not
               have titlebars.  MakeTitle may be used with this option to
               force titlebars to be put on specific windows.  The default is:
                   NoTitle
                   {
                       "VTWM *"
                       "xclock"
                       "xload"
                   }

       NoTitleFocus
               This variable indicates that vtwm should not set keyboard input
               focus to each window as it is entered.  Normally, vtwm sets the
               focus so that focus and key events from the titlebar and icon
               managers are delivered to the application.  If the pointer is
               moved quickly and vtwm is slow to respond, input can be
               directed to the old window instead of the new.  This option is
               typically used to prevent this "input lag" and to work around
               bugs in older applications that have problems with focus
               events.

       NoTitleHighlight [{ win-list }]
               This variable indicates that the highlight area of the
               titlebar, which is used to indicate the window that currently
               has the input focus, should not be displayed.  If the optional
               win-list is given, only those windows will not have highlight
               areas.  This and the SqueezeTitle options can be set to
               substantially reduce the amount of screen space required by
               titlebars.

       NotVirtualGeometries
               This variable indicates that vtwm should assume that user
               geometries should be relative to the current screen-view into
               the virtual space, as opposed to the default of absolute use of
               the user geometries in the virtual space.  If you set this,
               then "xterm -geometry +20+20" specifies a position in the
               current view; otherwise, it would specify a position in the
               top-left view.  By default, +20+20 specifies a position in the
               top-left view.  See FixManagedVirtualGeometries,
               FixTransientVirtualGeometries, and UsePPosition.

       NoWindowRing { win-list }
               This variable specifies a list of windows that will not be
               added to the list along which the f.warpring function cycles.
               See also WindowRing.

       OldFashionedTwmWindowsMenu

       OldFashionedVtwmWindowsMenu
               By default, the VTWM Windows menu will use the same colors that
               you see in the panner. This variable disables that behavior.

       OpaqueMove [{ win-list }]

       OpaqueResize [{ win-list }]
               These variables indicate that the f.move and f.resize functions
               should actually change the window instead of just an outline so
               that the user can immediately see what the window will look
               like.  If the optional win-list is given, only those windows
               will be affected "opaquely".  These options are typically used
               on fast systems (particularly when NoGrabServer is set).

       PanDistanceX N

       PanDistanceY N
               These variables define a grid of screens for the virtual
               desktop, expressed as N% of a real screen. When the f.snap
               function is called, the real screen will be moved to the
               closest grid location. The (mis)naming of these variables is
               for historical reasons. The default value is 100, effectively
               setting up "pages" in the virtual desktop.

       PanResistance milliseconds
               This variable indicates how hard it should be to pan to an
               adjacent virtual screen.  It specifies how long the pointer
               must be within AutoPanBorderWidth pixels of the real screen's
               edge.  Values equal to 0 or greater than 10000 disables this
               feature.  The default is 750 milliseconds.

       PauseOnExit N

       PauseOnQuit N
               These variables define a delay on exit, expressed in seconds.
               They allow the (vtwm stop) and f.quit sounds time to play
               before the connection to rplayd(8) is closed.

       Pixmaps { pixmaps }
               This variable specifies a list of images that define the
               appearance of various windows.  Each entry is a keyword
               indicating the window to set, followed by a string giving the
               name of the image. Built-in and external images may be freely
               mixed, given the constraints described in the IMAGE AND AUDIO
               FORMATS section.  The following windows may be specified thus:
                   Pixmaps
                   {
                       TitleHighlight             ":xpm:sunkenbox"
                       RealScreenPixmap           "scaledbackground.xpm"
                       VirtualBackgroundPixmap    "gray1"
                       MenuIconPixmap             ":xpm:rarrow"
                       IconManagerPixmap          ":xpm:zoom"
                   }

               By default, the TitleHighlight is an even, stippled pattern if
               vtwm is built with 2D features, or "sunken" lines when vtwm is
               built with 3D features. The MenuIconPixmap is a right arrow by
               default (rendered 3D as appropriate), and the default
               IconManagerPixmap is either the X logo or a "raised" box, for
               2D or 3D features, respectively.

       PointerPlacement
               This variable indicates that windows with no specified geometry
               should be placed with the window origin at the location of the
               mouse pointer or, if WarpSnug is specified, as close as
               possible to that location such that the window fits onto the
               real screen. If RandomPlacement is also set then it takes
               precedence.

       PrettyZoom
               If Zoom is turned on, this makes the associated animation look
               just a little nicer, depending on your personal taste.  This
               makes the zoom slower, however, so you may have to decrease the
               value of the Zoom variable.

       RaiseDelay milliseconds
               For windows that are to be automatically raised when the
               pointer enters (see the AutoRaise variable and the f.autoraise
               function) this variable specifies the length of time the
               pointer should rest in the window before it is raised.  The
               default is 0 milliseconds.

       RaiseOnStart
               This variable specifies that the raise which would normally
               occur at the end of a move or resize operation (subject to
               MoveDelta, NoRaiseOnMove, and NoRaiseOnResize) will occur at
               the start of the operation. This may be useful when OpaqueMove
               and/or OpaqueResize are specified. Note that cancelling a move
               or resize operation with this variable set will not preserve
               the window stacking order.

       RandomPlacement
               This variable indicates that windows with no specified geometry
               should be placed in a pseudo-random location instead of having
               the user drag an outline (or the window itself if the
               OpaqueMove variable is set) to the preferred location.

       RealScreenBackground string
               See RealScreenForeground.

       RealScreenBorderWidth pixels
               This value specifies the border width of the RealScreen window
               (see RealScreenForeground). The default value is 0 pixels.

       RealScreenForeground string
               Inside what vtwm calls the virtual desktop window, but which we
               might call the "panner", is a little window that shows where
               the physical screen is located in virtual space.  The vtwm
               source code calls this little window the RealScreen.  By
               default, it has no border, and can be distinguished from the
               normal backdrop of the panner only by its color or image.  Its
               foreground color has no meaning unless you give it an image.
               (It can be given a border with RealScreenBorderWidth.)

       RealScreenPixmap string
               Names an image file used to decorate the RealScreen window.  A
               sample is provided, nestedsqu.xbm, but your mileage may vary as
               the size of your screen varies!  It is easy to find out the
               size of this window and to create any image file of type
               bitmap(1) or pixmap(1) for it; that is the recommended
               procedure.

       RecoverStolenFocus attempts
               This variable indicates that vtwm should attempt to return
               focus if it discovers some client window is grabbing focus on
               its own.  After attempts unsuccessful trials vtwm gives up.  By
               default vtwm does not attempt to steal focus back.  The
               titlebar highlighting will always indicate where focus is
               directed, even after focus theft by a greedy client.  Vtwm also
               measures X11-server roundtrip and esimates a timeout for focus
               recovery, and no further attempts are made if this timeout is
               reached.  (Attention: high system load or mouse movement speed
               may lead to accidental focus lag.)

       ResizeFont string
               This variable specifies the font to be used for in the
               dimensions window when resizing windows.  The default is
               "-adobe-helvetica-bold-r-normal--*-120-*-*-*-*-*-*".

       ResizeRegion location
               This variable specifies the area on the screen to display the
               resize window.  The location should be one of NorthWest,
               NorthEast, SouthWest, SouthEast, or Centered.

       RestartOnScreenChangeNotify
               This per-screen variable indicates that vtwm should
               automatically execute f.restart in case RRScreenChangeNotify
               event of XRANDR X11-extension occurs on the given screen.  In
               order to preserve client window unzoomed sizes all zoomed
               clients are unzoomed first.

       RestartOnScreenSizeChangeNotify
               In contrast to RestartOnScreenChangeNotify this variable
               indicates that vtwm should restart on the RRScreenChangeNotify
               event only if the X11 logical screen size has changed (i.e. the
               values returned by XDisplayWidth() or XDisplayHeight() differ
               from those in effect during vtwm startup).

       RestartPreviousState
               This variable indicates that vtwm should attempt to use the
               WM_STATE property on client windows to tell which windows
               should be iconified and which should be left visible.  This is
               typically used to try to regenerate the state that the screen
               was in before the previous window manager was shutdown. It is
               set by default.

       RightHandSidePulldownMenus
               Pull-down menus can appear when the pointer is to the right of
               the center of their parent menu, or they can appear when the
               pointer is closer to the right edge of their parent menu.  This
               option enables the latter behavior, and is the default.

       SaveColor { colors-list }
               This variable indicates a list of color assignments to be
               stored as pixel values in the root window property
               _MIT_PRIORITY_COLORS.  Clients may elect to preserve these
               values when installing their own colormap.  Note that use of
               this mechanism is a way an for application to avoid the
               "technicolor" problem, whereby useful screen objects such as
               window borders and titlebars disappear when a programs custom
               colors are installed by the window manager.  For example:
                   SaveColor
                   {
                       BorderColor
                       TitleBackground
                       TitleForeground
                       "red"
                       "green"
                       "blue"
                   }

               This would place on the root window 3 pixel values for borders
               and titlebars, as well as the three color strings, all taken
               from the default colormap.

       ShallowReliefWindowButton
               This indicates that the features of built-in 3D titlebar
               buttons, the 3D icon manager button the 3D menu pull-right
               icon, and the 3D titlebar highlight area should be rendered
               with a "flatter" appearance. It is set by default if vtwm is
               built with 3D features.

       ShowIconManager
               This variable indicates that the icon manager window should be
               displayed when vtwm is started. If not set it will remain
               hidden unless brought up using the f.showiconmgr function.

       SloppyFocus
               This boolean variable sets the vtwm client focusing model
               initially into sloppy mode: moving the mouse out of some client
               window doesn't unfocus it until some other client window is
               entered.  Default value is FALSE and can be set to TRUE by
               f.sloppyfocus (f.unfocus and f.focus recover FALSE).

       SnapRealScreen
               This variable causes the real screen to snap to a grid defined
               in PanDistanceX and PanDistanceY increments whenever the
               representation moves. The f.snaprealscreen function can be used
               to toggle this setting.

       SortIconManager
               This variable indicates that entries in the icon manager should
               be sorted alphabetically rather than by simply appending new
               windows to the end. It is set by default.

       SoundHost string
               This variable specifies what machine (by its TCP/IP hostname)
               is running the rplayd(8) daemon. If not specified, the local
               machine is tried. If rplayd(8) cannot be accessed, sound will
               be toggled off.

       Sounds { sound-list }
               This variable is a list of identifiers and associated sound
               files. It contains entries of the form:
                   "identifier"    "soundfile"    [volume]
               where identifier is any function described in the BINDINGS
               section except f.playsound, f.sounds, and f.separator, as well
               as these event identifiers: (vtwm start), (vtwm stop), (client
               map), (client unmap), (menu map), (menu unmap), (info unmap),
               (autopan event), and (bell event). The soundfile is the full
               pathname of the sound file to play for the associated
               identifier, and volume sets the volume for which to play that
               sound (see also SoundVolume). Note that the list entries must
               be quoted:
                   Sounds
                   {
                       "(vtwm start)"    "/usr/share/sounds/wowee.wav"
                       "(vtwm stop)"     "/usr/share/sounds/seeya.wav"
                       "f.exec"          "/usr/share/sounds/click.au"   50
                       "(client map)"    "/usr/share/sounds/ping.au"    50
                       "f.delete"        "/usr/share/sounds/doh1.wav"
                       "f.deletedoor"    "/usr/share/sounds/doh2.wav"
                       "f.destroy"       "/usr/share/sounds/doh3.wav"
                       "(client unmap)"  "/usr/share/sounds/ping.au"
                   }

               This example points out that some identifiers "overlap":
                   f.beep > (bell event)            f.exec > (client map)
                   f.delete > (client unmap)        f.menu > (menu map)
                   f.deletedoor > (client unmap)    f.quit > (vtwm stop)
                   f.destroy > (client unmap)       f.version = f.identify

               In these cases, the function takes precedence over the event
               when both would otherwise play.

       SoundVolume N
               This variable sets the overall volume for which to play sounds,
               expressed as N% of maximum. Default is 25 (1/4 attenuation).

       SqueezeTitle [{ squeeze-list }]
               This variable indicates that vtwm should attempt to use the
               SHAPE extension to make titlebars occupy only as much screen
               space as they need, rather than extending all the way across
               the top of the window.  The optional squeeze-list may be used
               to control the location of the squeezed titlebar along the top
               of the window.  It contains entries of the form:
                   "name"    justification    num    denom
               where name is a window name, justification is either left,
               center, or right, and num and denom are numbers specifying a
               ratio for the relative position about which the titlebar is
               located, measured from left to right.  A ratio of 0/0 indicates
               that the justification is absolute, A non-zero numerator with a
               zero denominator indicates a pixel count, and the justification
               is ignored entirely for any other ratio.  For example:
                   SqueezeTitle
                   {
                       "XTerm"     left      0    0
                       "xterm1"    left      1    3
                       "xterm2"    right     2    3
                       "oclock"    center    0    0
                       "emacs"     right     0    0
                   }

               The DontSqueezeTitle list can be used to turn off squeezing on
               certain titles. It is set by default.

       StartIconified [{ win-list }]
               This variable indicates that client windows should initially be
               left as icons until explicitly deiconified by the user.  If the
               optional win-list is given, only those windows will be started
               iconic.  This is useful for programs that do not support an
               -iconic command line option or resource.

       StaticIconPositions
               This variable alters icon placement such that they will
               maintain their positions on the virtual desktop when not nailed
               and DeiconifyToScreen is not used.  This is most applicable
               when SnapRealScreen and AutoPan is used with PanDistanceX and
               PanDistanceY values to simulate ctwm(1) workspaces.

       StayUpMenus
               This variable alters menu interaction.  By default, a menu item
               is selected when a pointer button is released over it.  This
               variable causes menu items to be selected on the next button
               press event.

       StayUpOptionalMenus
               This variable is similar to StayUpMenus, except that if any
               menu items are selected, the menu interaction reverts to the
               old behavior.  For example, suppose you have the right pointer
               button bound to bring up a menu with a title bar.  Clicking the
               right button and releasing it (over the title bar) will bring
               up the menu and have it stay up until you click on a menu item.
               Clicking the right button, moving the pointer to a menu item,
               and releasing the right button will activate that menu item and
               dismiss the menu.

       Sticky { list }
               A synonym for NailedDown.

       StickyAbove
               A synonym for NailedAbove.

       StrictIconManager
               This variable causes icon managers to list only those windows
               that are in an iconified state.

       TextOffsets { offset-list }
               This list provides fine grain control over the placement of
               fonts.  Each entry is a keyword indicating a font followed by a
               string indicating an offset in the standard X11 geometry "+X+Y"
               (i.e. without the height and width parts).  For example:
                   TextOffsets
                   {
                       TitleFont           "+1-1"
                       MenuTitleFont       "+0+1"
                       MenuFont            "+0-1"
                       IconManagerFont     "+0-2"
                       VirtualDesktopFont  "-1-4"
                   }

               Default offsets are "+0+0".

       TitleBackground string [{ win-list }]
               This variable specifies the background color used in titlebars,
               and may only be specified inside of a Color or Monochrome list.
               The optional win-list is a list of window names and colors so
               that per-window colors may be specified. The default is
               "maroon" for color displays or "gray50" for monochrome
               displays.

       TitleBevelWidth pixels
               Tells vtwm to use 3D-looking titlebars, and specifies the width
               in pixels of the bevel that surrounds the titlebar. If the
               value of ButtonIndent added to FramePadding equals zero, the
               bevel will be bound to the text and highlight area. The default
               is 0 if vtwm is built with 2D features, or 1 when vtwm is built
               with 3D features..

       TitleButtonBorderWidth pixels
               This variable specifies the width in pixels of the border
               surrounding titlebar buttons, drawn in the TitleForeground
               color. The default is 1 if vtwm is built with 2D bitmaps, or 0
               when vtwm is built with 3D pixmaps.

       TitleFont string
               This variable specifies the font to used for displaying window
               names in titlebars.  The default is "-adobe-helvetica-bold-r-
               normal--*-120-*-*-*-*-*-*".

       TitleForeground string [{ win-list }]
               This variable specifies the foreground color used in titlebars,
               and may only be specified inside of a Color or Monochrome list.
               The optional win-list is a list of window names and colors so
               that per-window colors may be specified.  The default is
               "maroon" for color displays or "gray50" for monochrome
               displays.

       TitlePadding pixels
               This variable specifies the distance between titlebar buttons
               in the titlebar.  Note that distances between buttons and the
               title, the title and the highlight area, and the highlight area
               and buttons, are all set to a hard-coded value.  The default is
               5 if vtwm is built with 2D features, or 0 when vtwm is built
               with 3D features.

       UnknownIcon string
               This variable specifies the filename of an image  file to be
               used as the default icon.  This image will be used as the icon
               of all clients which do not provide an icon image and are not
               listed in the Icons list.

       UnzoomToScreen
               When unzooming a window, by default, the window will be placed
               at its previous geometry in the virtual desktop. With this
               variable set, vtwm ensures that the window will be placed
               somewhere on the real screen.

       UsePPosition string [{ win-list }]
               This variable specifies whether or not vtwm should honor
               program-requested locations (given by the PPosition flag in the
               WM_NORMAL_HINTS property), in the absence of a user-specified
               position.  The argument string may have one of four values:
               "off" (the default) indicating that vtwm should ignore the
               program-supplied position, "on" indicating that the position
               should be used, "non-zero" indicating that the position should
               used if it is other than (0,0) (for working around a bug in
               older toolkits) and finally "on-screen" indicating that the
               position should only be used it it resolves to something
               visible on the physical screen.  The optional win-list is a
               list of window names and arguments that will override the
               global string argument. For example:
                   UsePPosition    "off"
                   {
                       "MPlayer"   "on"
                   }

       VirtualBackground string
               This is the background color for the panner, a.k.a. the Virtual
               Desktop window.  The default is "maroon" for color displays or
               "gray50" for monochrome displays.

       VirtualBackgroundPixmap string
               Names an image file to decorate the panner.

       VirtualForeground string
               Foreground for the panner; has no use unless you specify a
               panner image of type bitmap(1).

       VirtualDesktop geometry scale
               This variable must be set to enable the virtual desktop
               features of vtwm. If this variable is not set, vtwm will behave
               in the same manner as twm. This variable specifies where to
               place the virtual desktop window and its size. The geometry is
               a standard X geometry specification and defines the size and
               location of the window containing the desktop representation.
               The geometry specification may include the @P parameter
               appended as described in IconManagerGeometry.

               The scale parameter specifies the scaling of the virtual
               desktop window compared to the desktop. The size specification
               can be given in three ways: If size is larger than the screen
               size, it represents the size of the whole desktop, and the
               virtual window desktop size will then be size divided by scale.
               When size times scale is smaller than the screen size, size
               represents the number of screens that should fit in the
               desktop. Otherwise size represents the size of the virtual
               desktop window, and the currently accessible virtual desktop is
               then scale times the size of the desktop window. Using the
               default as an example:
                   VirtualDesktop    "5x2-0-0"    16
               With scale set to 16, and a physical screen size of 1024x768,
               the desktop area is 1/16 the size of the screen times the
               number of screens specified:
                   (5 * (1024 / 16)) x (2 * (768 / 16)) = 320 x 96

               The size of the desktop can be changed dynamically, by simply
               resizing the virtual desktop window.

       VirtualDesktopBevelWidth pixels
               Tells vtwm to use a 3D-looking virtual desktop, and specifies
               the width in pixels of the bevel.  The default is 0 if vtwm is
               built with 2D features, or 1 when vtwm is built with 3D
               features.

       VirtualDesktopFont font
               This variable causes font to be used when displaying the names
               of windows in the virtual desktop display.  If this variable is
               not set, then names will not be displayed.  The
               DesktopDisplayForeground should also be set for this feature to
               be useful.  The default is "-adobe-helvetica-medium-r-
               normal--*-80-*-*-*-*-*-*".

       VirtualReceivesMotionEvents

       VirtualSendsMotionEvents
               These variables indicate that changes to the position and
               dimension of windows on the real screen will be reflected in
               the virtual desktop as they occur, and visa-versa.

       WarpCentered string
               By default, on warps to windows, the pointer goes to either the
               center of the titlebar, or in the absence of, the center of the
               top border member.  This variable specifies that the pointer
               should warp to the center of the window depending on the string
               argument: "on" indicates all windows, "titled" indicates titled
               windows only, "untitled" indicates untitled windows only, and
               "off" (the default) indicating the default behavior. Note that
               warps to icon managers are exceptional: The pointer always goes
               to either the active entry, or in the absence of, the top
               entry.

       WarpCursor [{ win-list }]
               This variable indicates that the pointer should be warped into
               windows when they are first created or later deiconified.  If
               the optional win-list is given, the pointer will only be warped
               when those windows are created or deiconified.  It is set by
               default.

       WarpNext
               With this variable set, the f.warpto function will begin
               searching vtwm's internal window list for a match beginning
               after the window with the focus, enabling multiple matches to
               be traversed. See also f.warpto.

       WarpSnug
               With this variable set, the warp functions (f.warp and the
               like) will fit the entire window on the screen, i.e., they'll
               be snugged on the real screen.

       WarpToTransients
               This variable indicates that the pointer should be warped into
               transient windows when they are created, given the
               corresponding clients pointed to by their WM_TRANSIENT_FOR
               window property have already focus.

       WarpUnmapped
               This variable indicates that the warp functions (f.warp and the
               like) should deiconify any iconified windows they encounter.
               This is typically used to make a key binding that will pop a
               particular window (such as xmh), no matter where it is.  The
               default is for the functions to ignore iconified windows.

       WarpVisible
               This variable indicates that the warp functions
               f.warpclassnext, f.warpclassprev, f.warpring, and f.warpto
               should restrict themselves to windows that are on the screen.
               The default is for the functions to traverse the entire virtual
               desktop.

       WarpWindows
               When warping to a window, by default the real screen will be
               moved to find the window on the virtual desktop. With this set,
               the window itself will be warped to the real screen, moving the
               window in the virtual desktop.

       WindowRing [{ win-list }]
               This variable specifies that when windows are created, they
               should be added to the list that the f.warpring function
               operates on. If the optional win-list is given, then only those
               windows will be included in the window ring. See also
               NoWindowRing and f.ring.

       XorValue number
               This variable specifies the value to use when drawing window
               outlines for moving and resizing.  This should be set to a
               value that will result in a variety of distinguishable colors
               when exclusive-or'ed with the contents of the user's typical
               screen.  Setting this variable to 1 often gives nice results if
               adjacent colors in the default colormap are distinct.  By
               default, vtwm will attempt to cause temporary lines to appear
               at the opposite end of the colormap from the graphics.

       Zoom [ count ]
               This variable indicates that outlines suggesting movement of a
               window to and from its iconified state should be displayed
               whenever a window is iconified or deiconified.  The optional
               count argument specifies the number of outlines to be drawn.
               The default count is 8.

       ZoomState geomstring
               This per-screen keyword indicates if WM_STATE or WM_HINTS
               initial-state property is set to ZoomState, the window is to be
               zoomed by vtwm on client startup as denoted in geomstring
               analogously to the f.panelzoom specification.  The WM_STATE
               property is set to ZoomState on vtwm shutdown if the client is
               zoomed in that moment as given in geomstring (without
               considering the panel index part).  Only the 'aliased' zooming
               geometry specifications are accepted.  By default the WM_STATE
               or WM_HINTS initial-state property value of ZoomState is
               treated as NormalState and no zooming is performed.

       ZoomZoom
               This variable modifies zooms such that a random place will be
               used for the source or destination when there isn't an
               appropriate window (e.g., an icon, icon manager entry, or
               client window).  Default behavior inhibits zooms when there
               aren't appropriate windows, except for the f.zoomzoom function.

SPECIAL VARIABLES
       The following variables must be set after the fonts have been assigned,
       so it is usually best to put them at the end of the variables or
       beginning of the bindings sections:

       DefaultFunction function
               This variable specifies the function to be executed when a key
               or button event is received for which no binding is provided.
               This is typically bound to f.nop, f.beep, or a menu containing
               window operations.

       WindowFunction function
               This variable specifies the function to execute when a window
               is selected from the VTWM Windows menu.  If this variable is
               not set (default), the window will be deiconified and raised.
               It is strongly recommended that if this is set, the function
               includes provision for deiconifying windows.

BINDINGS
       After the desired variables have been set, functions may be attached
       titlebar buttons and key and pointer buttons.  Titlebar buttons may be
       added from the left or right side and appear in the titlebar from left-
       to-right according to the order in which they are specified.  Key and
       pointer button bindings may be given in any order.

       Titlebuttons specifications must include the name of the image to use
       in the button box and the function to be invoked when a pointer button
       is pressed within them:
           LeftTitleButton  "image" = function
       or
           RightTitleButton "image" = function

       See the ButtonIndent and FramePadding variables and the IMAGE AND AUDIO
       FORMATS section for details on the image specification.

       Key and pointer button specifications must give the modifiers that must
       be pressed, over which parts of the screen the pointer must be, and
       what function is to be invoked.  Keys are given as strings containing
       the appropriate keysym name; buttons are given as the keywords
       Button1-Button5:
           "FP1"   = modlist : context : function
           Button1 = modlist : context : function

       The modlist is any combination of the modifier names shift, control,
       lock, meta, mod1, mod2, mod3, mod4, or mod5 (which may be abbreviated
       as s, c, l, m, m1, m2, m3, m4, m5, respectively) separated by a
       vertical bar (|).  Similarly, the context is any combination of window,
       title, icon, root, frame, virtual, desktop, door, iconmgr, their first
       letters (iconmgr abbreviation is m, door has no abbreviation), or all,
       separated by a vertical bar.  It is rumored that window class names
       will also work.  The function is any of the f. keywords described
       below.  For example, the default startup file contains the following
       bindings:
           Button1 =   : root          : f.menu "VTWM Windows"
           Button1 = m : window | icon : f.function "move-or-lower"
           Button2 = m : window | icon : f.iconify
           Button3 = m : window | icon : f.move
           Button1 =   : title         : f.move
           Button2 =   : title         : f.raiselower
           Button1 =   : icon          : f.function "move-or-iconify"
           Button2 =   : icon          : f.iconify
           Button1 =   : iconmgr       : f.iconify
           Button2 =   : iconmgr       : f.iconify

       A user who wanted to be able to manipulate windows from the keyboard
       could use the following bindings:
           "F1"    =       : all : f.iconify
           "F2"    =       : all : f.raiselower
           "F3"    =       : all : f.warpring "next"
           "F4"    =       : all : f.warpto "xmh"
           "F5"    =       : all : f.warpto "emacs"
           "F6"    =       : all : f.colormap "next"
           "F7"    =       : all : f.colormap "default"
           "F20"   =       : all : f.warptoscreen "next"
           "Left"  = m     : all : f.backiconmgr
           "Right" = m | s : all : f.forwiconmgr
           "Up"    = m     : all : f.upiconmgr
           "Down"  = m | s : all : f.downiconmgr

       Note, however, that using all for button or key bindings is almost
       always a bad idea, since it prevents all applications from receiving
       those events; this can cripple text and graphics editors that otherwise
       expect to see those buttons or keys (see also the IgnoreModifiers
       variable, and the f.bindbuttons, f.bindkeys, f.unbindbuttons, and
       f.unbindkeys functions).

       vtwm provides many more window manipulation primitives than can be
       conveniently stored in a titlebar, menu, or set of key bindings.
       Although a small set of defaults are supplied (unless either
       NoDefaults, NoDefaultMouseOrKeyboardBindings, or NoDefaultTitleButtons
       is specified), most users will want to have their most common
       operations bound to key and button strokes.  To do this, vtwm
       associates names with each of the primitives and provides user-defined
       functions for building higher level primitives and menus for
       interactively selecting among groups of functions.

       User-defined functions contain the name by which they are referenced in
       calls to f.function and a list of other functions to execute.  For
       example:
           Function "move-or-lower"    { f.move f.deltastop f.lower }
           Function "move-or-iconify"  { f.move f.deltastop f.iconify }
           Function "restore-colormap" { f.colormap "default" f.lower }

       The function name must be used in f.function exactly as it appears in
       the function specification.

       VTWM PROFILE.  If a function called "VTWM Profile" is defined within
       the startup file, that function will be executed upon startup or
       restarting of the window manager.  For example:
           AutoPan    25
           Function   "VTWM Profile"
           {
               f.autopan
           }
       gives AutoPan a value but turns autopanning off initially (it won't
       have a value unless AutoPan is set in the startup file; see f.autopan
       below), in case you want to turn it on sometime later.

       In the descriptions below, if the function is said to operate on the
       selected window, but is invoked from a root menu, the cursor will be
       changed to the Select cursor and the next window to receive a button
       press will be chosen:

       ! string
               This is an abbreviation for f.exec string.

       ^ string (OBSOLETE --- use a clipboard client)
               This is an abbreviation for f.cut string.

       f.autopan
               If autopan wasn't configured in your .vtwmrc file, this does
               nothing. If, however, it was configured, this toggles the
               current autopan state. The reason for this command is that
               autopan is sometimes nice to have, but it interferes with using
               sticky windows that are near the edge of the screen. With this
               command, you get the best of both worlds.

       f.autoraise
               This function toggles whether or not the selected window is
               raised whenever entered by the pointer.  See the description of
               the variable AutoRaise.

       f.backiconmgr
               This function warps the pointer to the previous column in the
               current icon manager, wrapping back to the previous row if
               necessary.

       f.beep  This function sounds the keyboard bell.

       f.bindbuttons

       f.bindkeys
               These functions enable vtwm's pointer or keyboard bindings for
               the selected window.  These are only needed if the bindings
               have been disabled with the f.unbindbuttons or f.unbindkeys
               functions.  Be careful what you bind these functions to;
               f.bindkeys bound to a window context key will not be accessable
               after f.unbindkeys is invoked for the window!

       f.bottomzoom
               This function is similar to the f.fullzoom function, but
               resizes the window to fill only the bottom half of the screen.

       f.circledown
               This function lowers the top-most window that occludes another
               window.

       f.circleup
               This function raises the bottom-most window that is occluded by
               another window.

       f.colormap string
               This function rotates the colormaps (obtained from the
               WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS property on the window) that vtwm will
               display when the pointer is in this window.  The argument
               string may have one of the following values: "next", "prev",
               and "default".  It should be noted here that in general, the
               installed colormap is determined by keyboard focus.  A pointer
               driven keyboard focus will install a private colormap upon
               entry of the window owning the colormap.  Using the click to
               type model, private colormaps will not be installed until the
               user presses a pointer button on the target window.

       f.cut string (OBSOLETE --- use a clipboard client)
               This function places the specified string (followed by a
               newline character) into the root window property CUT_BUFFER0.

       f.cutfile (OBSOLETE --- use a clipboard client)
               This function reads the file indicated by the contents of the
               CUT_BUFFER0 window property and replaces the cut buffer.

       f.deiconify
               This function deiconifies the selected window.  If the window
               is not an icon, this function does nothing.

       f.delete
               This function sends the WM_DELETE_WINDOW message to the
               selected window if the client application has requested it
               through the WM_PROTOCOLS window property.  The application is
               supposed to respond to the message by removing the window.  If
               the window has not requested WM_DELETE_WINDOW messages, the
               keyboard bell will be rung indicating that the user should
               choose an alternative method.  Note this is very different from
               f.destroy.  The intent here is to delete a single window,  not
               necessarily the entire application.

       f.deletedoor
               This function deletes a door.

       f.deltastop
               This function allows a user-defined function to be aborted if
               the pointer has been moved more than MoveDelta pixels.  See the
               example definition given for Function "move-or-lower" at the
               beginning of the section.

       f.destroy
               This function instructs the X server to close the display
               connection of the client that created the selected window.
               This should only be used as a last resort for shutting down
               runaway clients.  See also f.delete.

               This action sometimes leaves a runaway process that consumes
               CPU cycles; you should always try to use the applications own
               quit function, rather than this one.

       f.downiconmgr
               This function warps the pointer to the next row in the current
               icon manger, wrapping to the beginning of the next column if
               necessary.

       f.enterdoor
               This function activates this door.  Typically one binds:
                   Button1 = : door : f.enterdoor
                   Button2 = : door : f.enterdoor
                   Button3 = : door : f.enterdoor

       f.exec string
               This function passes the argument string to /bin/sh for
               execution.  In multiscreen mode, if string starts a new X
               client without giving a display argument, the client will
               appear on the screen from which this function was invoked.

       f.file string (OBSOLETE --- use a clipboard client)
               This function assumes string is a file name.  This file is read
               into the window server's cut buffer.

       f.focus This function toggles the keyboard focus of the server to the
               selected window, changing the focus rule from pointer-driven if
               necessary.  If the selected window already was focused, this
               function executes an f.unfocus.

       f.forcemove
               This function is like f.move except that it ignores the
               DontMoveOff variable.

       f.forwiconmgr
               This function warps the pointer to the next column in the
               current icon manager, wrapping to the beginning of the next row
               if necessary.

       f.fullzoom
               This function resizes the selected window to the full size of
               the display or else restores the original size if the window
               was already zoomed.

       f.function string
               This function executes the user-defined function whose name is
               specified by the argument string.

       f.hbzoom
               This function is a synonym for f.bottomzoom.

       f.hidedesktopdisplay
               This function unmaps the desktop display.

       f.hideiconmgr
               This function unmaps the current icon manager when selected
               from a client window, and unmaps all icon managers when
               selected from the root window.

       f.horizoom
               This variable is similar to the f.zoom function except that the
               selected window is resized to the full width of the display.

       f.htzoom
               This function is a synonym for f.topzoom.

       f.hzoom This function is a synonym for f.horizoom.

       f.iconify
               This function iconifies or deiconifies the selected window or
               icon, respectively.

       f.identify
               This function displays a summary of the name and geometry of
               the selected window.  Clicking the pointer or pressing a key in
               the window will dismiss it.  If the function is invoked on a
               desktop representation of a window, the real window which is
               represented will be identified.

       f.lefticonmgr
               This function similar to f.backiconmgr except that wrapping
               does not change rows.

       f.leftzoom
               This variable is similar to the f.bottomzoom function but
               causes the selected window is only resized to the left half of
               the display.

       f.lower This function lowers the selected window.

       f.maximize
               This function maximizes the selected window. In contrast to
               f.fullzoom the top-left pixel of the client window is placed to
               the top-left of the screen, possibly leaving the titlebar and
               the frame window borders out of the visible screen area.

       f.menu string
               This function invokes the menu specified by the argument
               string.  Cascaded menus may be built by nesting calls to
               f.menu.

       f.move  This function drags an outline of the selected window (or the
               window itself if the OpaqueMove variable is set) until the
               invoking pointer button is released, at which time the window
               is raised (subject to RaiseOnStart, MoveDelta, and
               NoRaiseOnMove). Double clicking within the number of
               milliseconds given by ConstrainedMoveTime warps the pointer to
               the center of the window and constrains the move horizontally
               or vertically, depending on pointer movement. To abort the
               move, press another button before releasing the invoking
               button.

       f.movescreen
               Moves a window (or possibly the real screen) inside the desktop
               display. To abort the move, press another button before
               releasing the invoking button.  By default, the bindings using
               the desktop context are defined as:
                   Button1 = : desktop : f.movescreen
                   Button2 = : desktop : f.movescreen

               This is useful if you want to reset the default keyboard and
               pointer bindings via NoDefaultMouseOrKeyboardBindings and use
               some of your own for the virtual desktop, e.g.:
                   NoDefaultMouseOrKeyboardBindings
                   Button1 = : desktop : f.movescreen
                   Button2 = : desktop : f.warp
                   Button3 = : desktop : f.iconify

               This function is not useful under any context other than
               "desktop".

       f.nail  This function nails or unnails the selected window onto the
               real screen; the current value of this property is toggled on
               the window.

       f.nailedabove
               This function toggles the setting of the NailedAbove variable.

       f.namedoor
               This function, bound to the door context, pastes a name from
               CUT_BUFFER0 into the selected door (see the BINDINGS section
               for details).

       f.newdoor
               This function creates a new door with it's destination and name
               set to the real screen's current position in the virtual
               desktop.

       f.nexticonmgr
               This function warps the pointer to the next icon manager
               containing any windows on the current or any succeeding screen.

       f.nop   This function does nothing and is typically used with the
               DefaultFunction or WindowFunction variables or to introduce
               blank lines in menus.

       f.panelmove geomstring
               This function moves the selected window to the location denoted
               by the extended geometry specification geomstring as described
               in IconManagerGeometry.  Geometry aliases left, right, top,
               bottom (e.g. "left@pointer", "top@1", etc.) denote the window
               is to be moved and aligned to the left, right, top or bottom
               edge on the specified target panel.  A relative shift by (X,Y)
               of the selected window can be specified by "[01]x[01]+X+Y@P"
               analogously to the description in f.panelzoom below.

       f.panelzoom geomstring
               This function enlarges the selected window as denoted by the
               extended geometry specification geomstring described in
               IconManagerGeometry.  Accepted are left, right, top, bottom,
               vertical, horizontal, full and maximize as geometry aliases in
               order to perform a zoom operation analogous to f.leftzoom, ...,
               f.maximize but restricted to the target panel specified by @P
               of geomstring.

               The non-aliased geometry string is used to denote relative zoom
               by (X,Y) pixels and has the form "[01]x[01]+X+Y@P", i.e. W, H
               having values 0 or 1 denoting if the X or Y component (or both)
               is to be considered in the following zoom operation.  If X (or
               Y) is positive, the right (or bottom) edge of the selected
               window is moved that many pixels to the right (or bottom).  If
               X (or Y) is negative, the left (or top) edge of the selected
               window is moved that many pixels to the left (or top)
               accordingly.  If X (or Y) is zero, then the corresponding
               window edge, left or right (top or bottom) depending on the '-'
               or '+' of X (or Y), is taken to the appropriate panel edge.
               The special value "-0-0" of geomstring can be used to restore
               the original window size and location after repeated execution
               of the geometry-based zooming.  Analogously "+0+0" overwrites
               the saved original size/location with the current values of the
               window size and location.  (For values e.g. "0x0+0+0@next" the
               window is only moved to the specified panel without changing
               its size, keeping its relative location as on the source panel
               if possible.)

       f.panup N

       f.pandown N

       f.panleft N

       f.panright N
               These functions move the real screen by N% of the screen
               dimension in the indicated direction.  These are ideally bound
               to the cursor keys:
                   "Up"    = : root : f.panup    "100"
                   "Down"  = : root : f.pandown  "100"
                   "Left"  = : root : f.panleft  "100"
                   "Right" = : root : f.panright "100"

       f.playsound soundfile
               This function plays the specified sound at SoundVolume volume.
               The soundfile must be the full pathname of the sound file. This
               is a rather "expensive" function compared to that provided by
               the Sounds variable, and should be avoided.

       f.previconmgr
               This function warps the pointer to the previous icon manager
               containing any windows on the current or preceding screens.

       f.quit  This function causes vtwm to restore the window's borders and
               exit.  If vtwm is the last client invoked from xdm, this will
               result in a server reset, and the user's session will be logged
               out.

               Users who stay logged in for long periods (days or weeks), or
               who like to change window managers, or experiment with them,
               may find it desirable to use a relatively simple application,
               such as xbiff(1), as the last application in their .xinitrc or
               .xsession file, letting the window manager start earlier, and
               run in the background.  This allows changing window managers
               without logging out, and also makes it much less likely that a
               session will be abruptly terminated by a bug in a complex
               program like a window manager.  The one drawback to this
               approach is that f.quit then no longer terminates the session:
               you need to use f.delete or f.destroy on that last application
               to logout.

       f.raise This function raises the selected window.

       f.raiselower
               This function raises the selected window to the top of the
               stacking order if it is occluded by any windows, otherwise the
               window will be lowered.

       f.refresh
               This function causes all windows to be refreshed.

       f.resetdesktop
               This function moves the real display to (0,0)

       f.resize
               This function drags an outline of the selected window (or the
               window itself if the OpaqueResize variable is set) after
               crossing a border (or by setting AutoRelativeResize) until the
               invoking pointer button is released, at which time the window
               is raised (subject to RaiseOnStart, MoveDelta, and
               NoRaiseOnResize). To abort the resize, press another button
               before releasing the invoking button.

       f.resizeto geomstring
               This function caused the window to be resized and moved to the
               indicated geometry provided as a command line argument.  This
               could be needed to, for example, resize your terminal windows
               which were maximized or otherwise zoomed across a vtwm or
               xrandr reset.

       f.restart
               This function kills and restarts vtwm. See also f.startwm.

       f.righticonmgr
               This function is similar to f.nexticonmgr except that wrapping
               does not change rows.

       f.rightzoom
               This variable is similar to the f.bottomzoom function except
               that the selected window is only resized to the right half of
               the display.

       f.ring  Selects a window and adds it to the WindowRing list, or removes
               it if it was already in the ring. This command makes f.warpring
               much more useful, by making its configuration dynamic.

       f.saveyourself
               This function sends a WM_SAVEYOURSELF message to the selected
               window if it has requested the message in its WM_PROTOCOLS
               window property.  Clients that accept this message are supposed
               to checkpoint all state associated with the window and update
               the WM_COMMAND property as specified in the ICCCM.  If the
               window has not requested this message, the keyboard bell will
               be rung.

       f.separator
               Valid only in menus. The effect is to add a line separator
               between the previous and the following entry. The name selector
               part in the menu is not used (but must be present).

       f.setrealscreen geomstr
               This function sets the real screen to the virtual coordinates
               specified.  The geomstr is a quoted string containing a
               standard geometry specification.

       f.showdesktopdisplay
               This function maps the desktop display.

       f.showiconmgr
               This function maps the current icon manager when selected from
               a client window, and maps all icon managers when selected from
               the root window.

       f.sloppyfocus
               This function sets the SloppyFocus state variable to TRUE so
               entering the sloppy mode of the vtwm client focusing policy.
               Executing f.unfocus or f.focus set this variable to FALSE,
               restoring the "focus strictly follows mouse" policy, or
               assigning focus to some client explicitly.  Executing
               f.sloppyfocus on a root window revokes focus from the client.

       f.snap  This function snaps the real screen to a grid defined on
               virtual space with PanDistanceX and PanDistanceY increments.

       f.snaprealscreen
               This function toggles the setting of SnapRealScreen.

       f.snugdesktop
               moves the display to try to fit all partially visible windows
               completely on the screen.

       f.snugwindow
               moves the display to try to fit the selected window completely
               on the screen

       f.sorticonmgr
               This function sorts the entries in the current icon manager
               alphabetically.  See the variable SortIconManager.

       f.sounds
               This function toggles the playing of sounds. It's a "mute"
               function.

       f.squeezecenter

       f.squeezeleft

       f.squeezeright
               Selects a window and makes its title appear as though you had
               configured it as
                   SqueezeTitle    center    0    0
               or
                   SqueezeTitle    left      0    0
               or
                   SqueezeTitle    right     0    0
               respectively. These make squeezed titles much more useful
               because their configuration is dynamic.

       f.startwm commandline
               This function kills vtwm, and starts up the window manager as
               specified by commandline. A trailing ampersand and/or
               environment variables should not be used. See also f.restart.

       f.staticiconpositions
               This function toggles the setting of StaticIconPositions.

       f.stick This function is a synonym for f.nail.

       f.stickyabove
               This function is synonymous with the f.nailedabove function.

       f.stricticonmgr
               This function toggles the setting of StrictIconManager.

       f.title This function provides a centered, unselectable item in a menu
               definition.  It should not be used in any other context.

       f.topzoom
               This variable is similar to the f.bottomzoom function except
               that the selected window is only resized to the top half of the
               display.

       f.twmrc Synonymous with f.restart.  Historically, this function was
               intended to cause the startup customization file to be re-read.

       f.unbindbuttons

       f.unbindkeys
               These functions disable vtwm's pointer or keyboard bindings for
               the selected window, allowing events to pass directly to the
               application.  These are useful, for example, when running
               another window manager within Xnest or Xvnc.

       f.unfocus
               This function resets the focus back to pointer-driven.  This
               should be used when a focused window is no longer desired.

       f.upiconmgr
               This function warps the pointer to the previous row in the
               current icon manager, wrapping to the last row in the same
               column if necessary.

       f.version
               This function causes the vtwm version window to be displayed.
               This window will be displayed until a pointer button is pressed
               or the pointer is moved from one window to another.

       f.virtualgeometries
               This function toggles the setting of NotVirtualGeometries.

       f.vlzoom
               This function is a synonym for f.leftzoom.

       f.vrzoom
               This function is a synonym for f.rightzoom.

       f.warp  Warp the cursor to the selected window.  This is only useful if
               the window is selected via the icon manager.

       f.warpclassnext string

       f.warpclassprev string
               These functions warp the pointer to the next or previous window
               in the specified class indicated by the argument string.  If
               string is "VTWM", only icon managers, doors, and the Virtual
               Desktop window are considered.  If string empty (i.e., ""), the
               class of the window with focus is used.  If the window is
               iconified, it will be deiconified if the variable WarpUnmapped
               is set or else ignored.

       f.warpring string
               This function warps the pointer to the next or previous window
               (as indicated by the argument string, which may be "next" or
               "prev") specified in the WindowRing variable.  If the window is
               iconified, it will be deiconified if the variable WarpUnmapped
               is set or else ignored.

       f.warpsnug
               This function toggles the setting of WarpSnug.

       f.warpto string
               This function warps the pointer to the window which has a name
               or class that matches string. The string may be a VTWM-style
               wildcard, but not a regular expression (see the WILDCARDS
               section for details).  If the window is iconified, it will be
               deiconified if the WarpUnmapped variable is set, or else
               ignored. If WarpNext is set, the search for a match begins just
               after the current window in vtwm's internal list of windows,
               enabling multiple matching windows to be traversed. By default,
               the first match will always be selected.

       f.warptoiconmgr string
               This function warps the pointer to the icon manager entry
               associated with the window containing the pointer in the icon
               manager specified by the argument string.  If string is empty
               (i.e., ""), the current icon manager is chosen.  If the window
               is iconified, it will be deiconified if the variable
               WarpUnmapped is set or else ignored.

       f.warptonewest
               This function warps the pointer to the most recently created
               window.  If the window is iconified, it will be deiconified if
               the variable WarpUnmapped is set or else ignored.

       f.warptoscreen string
               This function warps the pointer to the screen specified by the
               argument string.  String may be a number (e.g., "0" or "1"),
               the word "next" (indicating the current screen plus 1, skipping
               over any unmanaged screens), the word "back" (indicating the
               current screen minus 1, skipping over any unmanaged screens),
               or the word "prev" (indicating the last screen visited.

       f.warpvisible
               This function toggles the setting of WarpVisible.

       f.winrefresh
               This function is similar to the f.refresh function except that
               only the selected window is refreshed.

       f.zoom  This function is similar to the f.fullzoom function, except
               that the only the height of the selected window is changed.

       f.zoomzoom
               This function makes a zoom outline from a random place to
               another random place (see the Zoom and ZoomZoom variables).
               It's silly, but can be used as a visual bell in place of
               f.beep.  See also the LessRandomZoomZoom variable.

MENUS
       Functions may be grouped and interactively selected using pop-up (when
       bound to a pointer button) or pull-down (when associated with a
       titlebar button) menus.  Each menu specification contains the name of
       the menu as it will be referred to by f.menu, optional default
       foreground and background colors, the list of item names and the
       functions they should invoke, and optional foreground and background
       colors for individual items:
           Menu    "menuname"    [ ("deffore":"defback") ]
           {
               string1    [ ("fore1":"back1")]    function1
               string2    [ ("fore2":"back2")]    function2
                 ...
               stringN    [ ("foreN":"backN")]    functionN
           }

       The menuname is case-sensitive.  The optional deffore and defback
       arguments specify the foreground and background colors used on a color
       display to highlight menu entries.  The string portion of each menu
       entry will be the text which will appear in the menu.  The optional
       fore and back arguments specify the foreground and background colors of
       the menu entry when the pointer is not in the entry.  These colors will
       only be used on a color display.  The default is to use the colors
       specified by the MenuForeground and MenuBackground variables.  The
       function portion of the menu entry is one of the functions, including
       any user-defined functions, or additional menus.

       There is a special menu named VTWM Windows which contains the names of
       all of the client and vtwm-supplied windows.  Selecting an entry will
       cause the WindowFunction to be executed on that window.  If
       WindowFunction hasn't been set, the window will be deiconified and
       raised.  This menu uses the same colors as the little windows in the
       panner.  This feature still honors the traditional TwmWindows menu name
       of yore.

ICONS
       vtwm supports several different ways of manipulating iconified windows.
       The common image-and-text style may be laid out by hand or
       automatically arranged as described by the IconRegion variable.  In
       addition, a terse grid of icon names, called an icon manager, provides
       a more efficient use of screen space as well as the ability to navigate
       among windows from the keyboard.

       An icon manager is a window that contains names of selected or all
       windows currently on the display.  In addition to the window name, a
       small button using the default iconify symbol will be displayed to the
       left of the name when the window is iconified.  By default, clicking on
       an entry in the icon manager performs f.iconify.  To change the actions
       taken in the icon manager, use the iconmgr context when specifying
       button and keyboard bindings.

       Moving the pointer into the icon manager also directs keyboard focus to
       the indicated window when NoIconManagerFocus is not set (setting the
       focus explicitly or else sending synthetic events if NoTitleFocus is
       set).  Using the f.upiconmgr, f.downiconmgr f.lefticonmgr, and
       f.righticonmgr functions, the input focus can be changed between
       windows directly from the keyboard.

IMAGE AND AUDIO FORMATS
       vtwm supports many images on its own (referred to as "internal" or
       "built-in" in this document), divided into two types, bitmaps and
       pixmaps. They are differentiated from file images by either a colon
       (':') or the string ":xpm:" as the first character(s) of the name,
       respectively:
           :darrow             scaled in any, n/a for highlight
           :delete / :xlogo    centered in any drawable
           :dot / :iconify     centered in any drawable
           :menu               scaled in any drawable
           :rarrow             scaled in any, n/a for highlight
           :resize             scaled in any drawable

           :xpm:bar            scaled in any drawable
           :xpm:box            scaled in any drawable
           :xpm:darrow         scaled in any, n/a for highlight
           :xpm:dot            centered in any drawable
           :xpm:lines          scaled in any drawable
           :xpm:menu           scaled in any drawable
           :xpm:raisedbox      scaled, for highlight only
           :xpm:raisedlines    scaled, for highlight only
           :xpm:rarrow         scaled in any, n/a for highlight
           :xpm:resize         scaled in any drawable
           :xpm:sunkenbox      scaled, for highlight only
           :xpm:sunkenlines    scaled, for highlight only
           :xpm:zoom           scaled in any drawable

       vtwm also supports a single image file format by default, the X Window
       System bitmap (files typically carrying an extension of ".xbm"), for
       two-color images. However, when built with the XPM library, vtwm will
       also support the X Window System pixmap (files typically carrying an
       extension of ".xpm"), for full-color images.

       All image types and sources can be freely mixed within the variables
       that use them, given the behavior listed above, and with the following
       additional exceptions: The Icons and UnknownIcon variables don't
       recognize the built-in images, the RealScreenPixmap, TitleHighlight,
       and VirtualBackgroundPixmap entries of the Pixmaps variable don't
       recognize the built-in images, only titlebar buttons can accomodate
       external images that would be larger than the default space allocated
       for them (in any other case, the image will be cropped to fit), and
       only the RealScreenPixmap, TitleHighlight, and VirtualBackgroundPixmap
       entries of the Pixmaps variable will tile small images into the space
       allocated for them.

       The icon manager drawable is hard-coded to 11x11 pixels, the menu
       drawable is MenuFont pixels square, and titlebar buttons are
           (TitleFont - (2 * ButtonIndent))
       pixels square. The titlebar highlight area is
           (titlebar height - (2 * FramePadding) - 2)
       pixels high, where titlebar height is determined by TitleFont or the
       titlebar button height, whichever is greater, and FramePadding.

       The root window can be decorated with whatever image files that are
       supported by X Window System utilities and applications (xloadimage(1),
       xsetroot(1), xv(1), etc.).

       If vtwm is built with sound support, several audio file formats are
       supported, not by vtwm per se, but by the rplayd(8) daemon.  Currently,
       the AU, AIFF, WAV, and VOC formats are natively supported, but see also
       rplay.helpers(5).

WILDCARDS
       vtwm supports "wildcarding" when matching windows against a variable's
       win-list. By default, the question mark ('?') represents any single
       character, the asterisk ('*') represents any zero or more characters,
       and brackets ('[' and ']') represent any characters listed within them.
       The backslash ('\') "escapes" any one character, allowing these
       reserved characters to be used literally.

       vtwm can support a richer method of character substitution, called
       regular expressions, or "RE"s. If vtwm is built with REs, many more
       "wildcard" rules are added. A description of REs is beyond the scope of
       this document; see the re_format(7) or egrep(1) man pages.

       vtwm distinguishes REs from strings by enclosing them in forward
       slashes ('/'). The two may be freely mixed; changing the example in the
       VARIABLES section to:
           AutoRaise
           {
               "emacs"
               "VTWM*"
               /x.*clock/    # was "x*clock"
               "Xmh"
               "XTerm"
           }
       accomplishes the same thing. This is but a simple example of RE usage,
       and as such doesn't demonstrate or leverage their capabilities.

SIGNALS
       It is possible to issue a f.restart via a UNIX signal, to ease
       debugging of vtwm resource files.  To do this, send a SIGUSR1 to the
       vtwm process ID (written to $HOME/vtwm.pid).  See kill(1) or slay(1).

Xft NOTES
       Vtwm 5.5.0 and later versions support antialiased font rendering based
       on the X server Xrender extension, Xft and FreeType2 technologies.
       From user's view this should not affect core font appearance (given the
       ttf-equivalents of X11 core fonts are installed) but the .vtwmrc font
       naming rules are extended to include the Xft font specification syntax,
       for example

           "Bitstream Vera Sans:medium:roman:size=10:antialias=true"

       with weight being one of light, medium, demibold, bold, black; slant
       one of roman, italic, oblique; and size being size, pixelsize.  Generic
       Xft fonts, e.g. at size 10 points, can be given by "monospace-10",
       "sans-10", "serif-10".  For further reading, see "The Xft font library:
       architecture and users guide" by Keith Packard.  (Xft truetype font
       rendering can be enabled with the EnableXftFontRenderer per-screen
       .vtwmrc configuration variable.)

BUGS
       There are precious few safeguards against binding functions to objects
       inappropriately, especially where the virtual desktop is concerned.

       Double clicking very fast to get the constrained move function will
       sometimes cause the window to move, even though the pointer is not
       moved.

       It is possible to "lose" windows in the virtual desktop by placing them
       in a large desktop area, then shrinking the desktop so as to remove
       them from view. They are still there, of course, but are unreachable
       until the desktop is grown sufficiently large again.

       See the BUGS file in the distribution for others.

FILES
       Searched for in the order shown:
           $HOME/.vtwmrc.<screen number>
           $HOME/.vtwmrc
           $VTWMDIR/twm/system.vtwmrc
           $HOME/.twmrc.<screen number>
           $HOME/.twmrc
           $VTWMDIR/twm/system.twmrc

       $HOME/vtwm.pid

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       DISPLAY This variable is used to determine which X server to use.  It
               is also set during f.exec so that programs come up on the
               proper screen.

       HOME    This variable is used as the prefix for files that begin with a
               tilde and for locating the vtwm startup file.
