PORTLESS(1)             FreeBSD General Commands Manual            PORTLESS(1)

NAME
     portless – quickly browse port descriptions

SYNOPSIS
     portless [-dfIiMmp] [-gG 'pattern'] [-P pager] portglob...
     portless [-IWw] [-gG 'pattern'] portglob...

DESCRIPTION
     portless lets FreeBSD users quickly browse port descriptions given the
     port's name or a (shell type) glob.

     The options are as follows:

     -d          Display the pkg-descr file of the port. This is the default.

     -f          Take the portglob argument literal (not as a shell glob).

     -gG 'pattern'
                 Filter the list of selected files with grep(1) . Option -G
                 differs from -g only by using fgrep rather than grep.

     -I          Ignore case when matching portglob against the ports tree.
                 This option is only effective if portglob contains at least
                 one unquoted globbing meta-character ( ‘*’, ‘?’, or ‘[’ ).
                 Used together with -g it also greps case insensitively.

     -i          Display the distinfo file of the port.

     -M          Display the Makefile file of the port.

     -m          Display the pkg-message file of the port.

     -p          Display the pkg-plist file of the port.

     -P pager    Use the specified pager program to display matching files.
                 This overrides the setting of the PAGER environment variable.

     -w          Rather than browsing files inside the ports tree just echo
                 the names of directories matching portglob to stdout.

     -W          Like -w but echoes just the last two components of the
                 directory (i.e. category/portname ) to stdout.

     Options -W and -w are incompatible with all other options.

ENVIRONMENT
     The portless command uses the following environment variables:
           PAGER        defaults to “less_-e”
           PORTSDIR     defaults to /usr/ports

FILES
     /usr/ports/*/*/*

EXAMPLES
     The following are examples of typical usage of the portless command:

           portless cvsweb\*
           portless lang/\*doc
           portless 'www/*python*'
