NAME
       HTML::Summary - generate a summary from a web page

SYNOPSIS
        use HTML::Summary;
        use HTML::TreeBuilder;

        my $tree = HTML::TreeBuilder->new;
        $tree->parse( $document );

        my $summarizer = HTML::Summary->new(
            LENGTH      => 200,
            USE_META    => 1,
        );

        $summary = $summarizer->generate( $tree );
        $summarizer->option( 'USE_META' => 1 );
        $length = $summarizer->option( 'LENGTH' );
        if ( $summarizer->meta_used() ) {
            # do something
        }

DESCRIPTION
       The "HTML::Summary" module produces summaries from the textual content
       of web pages. It does so using the location heuristic, which determines
       the value of a given sentence based on its position and status within
       the document; for example, headings, section titles and opening
       paragraph sentences may be favoured over other textual content. A
       LENGTH option can be used to restrict the length of the summary
       produced.

CONSTRUCTOR
   new( $attr1 => $value1 [, $attr2 => $value2 ] )
       Possible attributes are:

       VERBOSE
           Generate verbose messages to STDERR.

       LENGTH
           Maximum length of summary (in bytes). Default is 500.

       USE_META
           Flag to tell summarizer whether to use the content of the "<META">
           tag in the page header, if one is present, instead of generating a
           summary from the body text. Note that if the USE_META flag is set,
           this overrides the LENGTH flag - in other words, the summary
           provided by the "<META"> tag is returned in full, even if it is
           greater than LENGTH bytes. Default is 0 (no).

        my $summarizer = HTML::Summary->new(LENGTH => 200);

METHODS
   option( )
       Get / set HTML::Summary configuration options.

        my $length = $summarizer->option( 'LENGTH' );
        $summarizer->option( 'USE_META' => 1 );

   generate( $tree )
       Takes an HTML::Element object, and generates a summary from it.

        my $tree = HTML::TreeBuilder->new;
        $tree->parse( $document );
        my $summary = $summarizer->generate( $tree );

   meta_used( )
       Returns 1 if the META tag description was used to generate the summary.

        if ( $summarizer->meta_used() ) {
            # do something ...
        }
