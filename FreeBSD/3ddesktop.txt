NAME
       3ddesk - activates 3D-Desktop, a 3D desktop switcher.

SYNOPSIS
       3ddesk [ OPTIONS ]

DESCRIPTION
       3D Desktop is an OpenGL program for switching virtual desktops in a
       seamless 3-dimensional manner.  The default "visualization" maps your
       screen onto an N-sided "carousel" which is rotated to select the next
       screen.  When activated the current desktop appears to zoom out so as
       to make your desktop appear to be actually in a 3d environment with
       your other desktops.

       OPTIONS are:

       --view=xxx
              Uses the options from the view in 3ddesktop.conf

       --mode=xxx
              Sets the arrangement mode (one of carousel (default), cylinder,
              linear, viewmaster, priceisright, flip, or random).

       --acquire[=#]
              Grab images for all the desktops by cycling thru (sleep for x
              millisecs at each screen for refresh)

              must be between 1 and 300.

       --zoomspeed
              How fast it zooms in an out. Default is 45, must be between 1

SETUP
       3ddesk --acquire

       This starts the 3ddeskd server and acquires an image of each of your
       virtual desktops.  It will cycle through each desktop and return to
       your current.

USAGE
       Bind a key combination to /usr/bin/3ddesk and press the bound key.
       This will bring you into a 3d environment where you choose your next
       desktop.  If the server hasn't been started it will try to start it.

FILES
       /etc/3ddesktop/3ddesktop.conf
