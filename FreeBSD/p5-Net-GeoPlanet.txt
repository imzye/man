NAME
       Net::GeoPlanet - Access Yahoo's GeoPlanet location service

SYNOPSIS
               use Net::GeoPlanet;
               use Data::Dumper;

               my $geoplanet = Net::GeoPlanet->new(api_key => $api_key);

               print Dumper($geoplanet->places(place => "Woodside, NY 11377"));

               print Dumper($geoplanet->place(
                                               woeid => "2507854",
                                               format => "json"
                                       ));

               print Dumper($geoplanet->parent(
                                               woeid => "638242",
                                               select => "long",

ABOUT
       Yahoo! GeoPlanet helps bridge the gap between the real and virtual
       worlds by providing an open, permanent, and intelligent infrastructure
       for geo-referencing data on the Internet.

       For more information see http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/

METHODS
   new
       Creates the object that will be used. It takes an arguement, which is
       the key assigned to you by Yahoo.

   places
       Returns a collection of places that match a specified place name, and
       optionally, a specified place type. The resources in the collection are
       long representations of each place (unless short representations are
       explicitly requested).

   place
       Returns a resource containing the long representation of a place
       (unless a short representation is explicitly requested).

   parent
       Returns a resource for the parent of a place. A place has only one
       parent.  The resource is the short representation of the parent (unless
       a long representation is requested).

   ancestors
       Returns a collection of places in the parent hierarchy (the parent, the
       parent of parent, etc.). The resources in the collection are short
       representations of each place (unless a long representation is
       specifically requested).

   belongtos
       Returns a collection of places that have a place as a child or
       descendant (child of a child, etc). The resources in the collection are
       short representations of each place (unless a long representation is
       specifically requested).

   neighbors
       Returns a collection of places that neighbor of a place. The resources
       in the collection are short representations of each place (unless a
       long representation is requested).

       Note that neighbors are not necessarily geographically contiguous.

   siblings
       Returns a collection of places that are siblings of a place. Siblings
       share the same parent and place type as the given place. The resources
       in the collection are short representations of each place (unless a
       long representation is requested).

   children
       Returns a collection of places that are children of a place. The
       resources in the collection are short representations of each place
       (unless a long representation is requested).

   placetypes
       Returns the complete collection of place types supported in GeoPlanet.
       The resources in the collection each describe a single place type.

   placetype
       Returns a resource that describes a single place type.

MATRIX PARAMETERS
       GeoPlanet supports several parameters (name/value pairs) called "matrix
       parameters" that allow users to request small portions of potentially
       large collections. Matrix parameters follow the collection name or
       filter they refer to. The place, parent, ancestors and palcetype
       subroutines do not support these parameters.

   start
       Skip first 'N' results

               $geoplanet->places(place => "Woodside, NY 11377", start => 1);

   count
       Return a maximum of N results. A count of 0 is interpreted as 'no
       maximum'

               $geoplanet->children(woeid => "23424977", count => 5);

QUERY PARAMETERS
       GeoPlanet supports several parameters (name/value pairs) called "query
       parameters" that allow users to specify a particular language or format
       for the response. Query parameters follow the resource/collection name,
       filter, and any matrix parameters.

   lang
       Return names in specified language (RFC 4646)

               $geoplanet->places(place => "Woodside, NY 11377", lang => "fr-CA");

   format
       Return results in specified format.  Accepted values are "xml", "json",
       "geojson".

               $geoplanet->neighbors(woeid => "2347563", format =>"json");

   callback
       Return JSON results wrapped in a JavaScript function call.  Only used
       when format=json or format=geojson

               $geoplanet->neighbors(
                       woeid => "2347563",
                       format =>"json",
                       callback => "myfunction"
               );

   select
       Return results in specified representation.  Accepted values are
       "short", "long".

               $geoplanet->belongtos(woeid => "23424900", select => "short");
