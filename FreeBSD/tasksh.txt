NAME
       tasksh - Interactive taskwarrior shell


SYNOPSIS
       tasksh
       tasksh --version


DESCRIPTION
       Tasksh can be used to create a more immersive taskwarrior environment.
       Any task command you run outside the shell can also be run inside the
       shell, without the need to prefix every command with "task".

       When built with libreadline, tasksh provides command editing and
       history.

       Tasksh has an integrated 'review' command that leads you through an
       interactive review session.

       Tasksh supports all recent versions of Taskwarrior.


COMMANDS
       Tasksh supports the following commands.  All other commands are passed
       intact to Taskwarrior.


       diagnostics
              Displays settings pertinent to tasksh, for diagnosing problems.


       exec <commands>
              This command allows you to run shell commands from within
              Tasksh. This is ideal for accessing man pages such as this. The
              '!' command can be used in place of the 'exec' keyword. Once the
              command is run, control returns to Tasksh.


       exit/quit
              These commands cause tasksh to terminate, returning you to your
              system shell.


       help   Shows a summary of commands, and how to obtain help.


       review [N]
              Begins an interactive review session, where you can mark tasks
              as reviewed, edit them using your text editor, provide
              modification commands, or skip them.  You can terminate a review
              session at any time, and the next review session will resume at
              the right place.

              To find tasks needing review, the '_reviewed' custom report is
              created and run, which filters tasks that have a missing
              'reviewed' UDA date, or have not been reviewed for a week.

              This means that if you run a review session to completion, there
              will be no need to review again for a week, and the review
              command will simply do nothing until then.

              The one week review cycle is defined by the '_reviewed' custom
              report, which can be modified if you prefer a monthly review
              cycle.

              If 'N' is provided, the session is limited to reviewing only N
              tasks.

              Note: requires Taskwarrior 2.5.0 or later.  For full details,
              see: <https://taskwarrior.org/docs/review.html>

CONFIGURATION
       Tasksh piggybacks on Taskwarrior's .taskrc configuration file, and
       refers to settings there. If you use a non-standard location for your
       .task database , and .taskrc file, Tasksh will not find them unless you
       set the TASKDATA and TASKRC environment variables. See 'man taskrc' for
       more details.

       The review command storeѕ a UDA ('reviewed') and report definition
       ('_reviewed').


       tasksh.autoclear=1
              If set to "1", causes each tasksh command to be preceded by a
              'clear screen' and cursor reset. Default is "0".
