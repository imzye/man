NAME
       Business::OnlinePayment::iAuthorizer - iAuthorizer.net backend for
       Business::OnlinePayment

SYNOPSIS
         use Business::OnlinePayment;

         my $tx = new Business::OnlinePayment("iAuthorizer");
         $tx->content('login'       => '...', # login, password, and serial for your account
                      'password'    => '...',
                      'serial'      => '...',
                      'action'      => 'Normal Authorization',
                      'card_number' => '4012888888881',  # test card
                      'expiration'  => '05/05',
                      'amount'      => '1.00',
                      'address'     => '123 Anystreet',
                      'zip'         => '12345',
                      'cvv2'        => '1234',
                     );

         $tx->submit();

         if($tx->is_success()) {
             print "Card processed successfully: ".$tx->authorization."\n";
         } else {
             print "Card was rejected: ".$tx->error_message."\n";
         }

SUPPORTED TRANSACTION TYPES
   Credit Card transactions
       All credit card transactions require the login, password, serial,
       action, amount, card_number and expiration fields.

       The type field is never required, as the module does not support check
       transactions.

       The action field may be filled out as follows:

       Normal Authorization, Authorization Only, and Credit

          The API documentation calls these Purchase, Authorization Only and Return.

       Post Authorization and Void

          Refered to as Force and Void transaction types in the API documentation,
          you must also pass in the authorization code (in the authorization field)
          that you recieved with the original transaction.

   Check transactions
       Check transactions are not supported by this module. It would not be
       difficult to add, but I will not be needing it, so I may not get to it.
       Feel free to submit a patch :).

DESCRIPTION
       For detailed information see Business::OnlinePayment.

COMPATIBILITY
       This module implements iAuthorizer.net's API, but does not support
       check transactions or the 'post back' response method.

       This module has been certified by iAuthorizer.

       Many thanks to Jason Kohles and Ivan Kohler, who wrote and maintain
       Business::OnlinePayment::AuthorizeNet, which I borrowed heavily from
       while building this module.

       The iAuthorizer.net service is required before this module will
       function, however the module itself is free software and may be
       redistributed and/or modified under the same terms as Perl itself.
