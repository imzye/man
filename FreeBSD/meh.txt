NAME
       meh - simple, minimalist, super fast image viewer

SYNOPSIS
       meh FILE...
       meh -list [LISTFILE]
       meh -ctl
       meh -v

DESCRIPTION
       meh is a small, simple, super fast image viewer using raw XLib.  It is
       similar to feh(1), but faster and simpler.

       meh can use ImageMagick's convert(1) to view almost 200 file formats,
       though it is slower for these formats.  Built-in formats are JPEG, PNG,
       BMP, and netpbm.

OPTIONS
       -list [LISTFILE]
              Treat LISTFILE as list of images. Defaults to stdin.

       -ctl   Display files as they are received on stdin.

       -v     Print version and exit.
