DESCRIPTION
       Clawsker is an applet to edit the so called Claws Mail hidden
       preferences.

       Claws Mail is a fast, lightweight and feature-rich MUA with a high
       number of configurable options. To keep the binary small and fast some
       of these preferences which are not widely used are not provided with a
       graphical interface for inspection and/or modification.

       Users wanting to edit such preferences had to face raw editing of their
       configuration files, now you can do it with a convenient GTK interface
       using Clawsker.

       In adition to hidden features Clawsker can edit also some other
       settings which usually can only be set indirectly. These include
       currently the saved positions (and sizes when available) of Claws Mail
       windows, all hot key mappings from application menus, and history files
       for editable autosaving drop-down lists.

OPTIONS
       -a | --alternate-config-dir dirname
           Uses dirname as Claws Mail configuration directory.

       -b | --verbose
           Tells more on the standard output.

       -c | --clawsrc filename
           Uses filename as Claws Mail resource configuration file. This sets
           the full file name overriding any previous setting.

       -h | --help
           Shows a brief help screen.

       -i | --ignore-versions
           Ignores any version detected or set by -u option. Almost all
           options will be available.

       -k | --hide-disabled-keys
           On hotkeys columns sets foreground colour of unassigned keys to the
           same colour used as background, rendering them invisible until
           selected. This may help locating assigned keys on very long lists.

       -r | --read-only
           Edits hidden preferences without saving the changes. It also works
           while Claws Mail is running.

       -s | --small-screen
           Resolution of display is autodetected to adjust UI for screens
           where default rendering would exceed available space. This option
           forces those small screen adjustments. This can be useful for
           screens where the UI fits resolution, but the screen state is
           already used by other programs.

       -u | --use-claws-version version
           Uses version as Claws Mail version instead of the real one. The
           version argument is a list of integers, separated by dots if
           needed.

       -v | --version
           Shows version information for program, Perl-GTK and Claws Mail.

       Weird option specifications may produce weird results (but otherwise
       correct).

LIMITATIONS
       A running Claws Mail cannot be detected when using the --clawsrc option
       because the directory containing the given file is not expected to be a
       full Claws Mail configuration folder. If that is the case use the
       --alternate-config-dir option instead.

       Detection will also fail if the temporary directory resolution differs.
       This may happen, for example, when the value of the environment
       variable TMPDIR, under Clawsker is not the same that it was when Claws
       Mail was launched. For Claws Mail versions greater than 3.17.8
       different values for XDG_RUNTIME_DIR or XDG_CACHE_HOME may also cause
       this.
