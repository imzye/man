Keyword::Pluggable(3)                      User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Keyword::Pluggable - define new keywords in pure Perl

SYNOPSIS
        package Some::Module;

        use Keyword::Pluggable;

        sub import {
            # create keyword 'provided', expand it to 'if' at parse time
            Keyword::Pluggable::define
                keyword => 'provided',
                package => scalar(caller),
                code    => 'if',
            ;
        }

        sub unimport {
           # disable keyword again
           Keyword::Pluggable::undefine keyword => 'provided', package => scalar(caller);
        }

        'ok'

DESCRIPTION
       Warning: This module is still new and experimental. The API may change
       in future versions. The code may be buggy. Also, this module is a fork
       from "Keyword::Simple", that somehow got stalled. If its author accepts
       pull requests, then it will probably be best to use it instead.

       This module lets you implement new keywords in pure Perl. To do this,
       you need to write a module and call "Keyword::Pluggable::define" in
       your "import" method. Any keywords defined this way will be available
       in the scope that's currently being compiled. The scope can be lexical,
       packaged, and global.

   Functions
       "Keyword::Pluggable::define %options"
           keyword
               The keyword is injected in the scope currently being compiled

           code (string or coderef)
               For every occurrence of the keyword, your coderef will be
               called and its result will be injected into perl's parse
               buffer, so perl will continue parsing as if its contents had
               been the real source code in the first place. First paramater
               to the eventual coderef will be all code textref following the
               keyword to be replaced, if examination and change is needed.

           expression
               String value; if "statement", then the injected code will be
               parsed as a statement.  If "expression", if will be parsed as
               an expression.  If "dynamic", then "code" must be a coderef
               rather than a string, returning a true value to indicate an
               expression or a false value to indicate a statement.  (For
               backward compatibility, a false value for "expression" is
               treated as "statement", and any unrecognized value is treated
               as "expression".)

           global
               Boolean flag; if set, then the scope is global, otherwise it is
               lexical or packaged

           package
               If set, the scope will be limited to that package, otherwise it
               will be lexical

       "Keyword::Pluggable::undefine %options"
           Allows options: "keyword", "global", "package" (see above).

           Disables the keyword in the given scope. You can call this from
           your "unimport" method to make the "no Foo;" syntax work.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       This module depends on the pluggable keyword API introduced in perl
       5.12. "parse_" functions were introduced in 5.14.  Older versions of
       perl are not supported.

       Every new keyword is actually a complete statement or an expression by
       itself. The parsing magic only happens afterwards. This means that e.g.
       the code in the "SYNOPSIS" actually does this:

         provided ($foo > 2) {
               ...
         }

         # expands to

         ; if
         ($foo > 2) {
               ...
         }

       The ";" represents a no-op statement, the "if" was injected by the Perl
       code, and the rest of the file is unchanged. This also means your it
       can only occur at the beginning of a statement, not embedded in an
       expression.  To be able to do that, use "expression => 1" flag.

       Keywords in the replacement part of a "s//.../e" substitution aren't
       handled correctly and break parsing.

       There are barely any tests.
