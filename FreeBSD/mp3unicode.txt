NAME
     mp3unicode – Convert MP3 tags to Unicode

SYNOPSIS
     mp3unicode [options] file1 [file2] [...]

DESCRIPTION
     mp3unicode MP3Unicode is a command line utility to convert ID3 tags in
     mp3 files between different encodings.

     In order to see the available encodings execute:

           iconv --list

OPTIONS
     -s, --source-encoding <encoding>
            Read current mp3 tags assuming they are encoded with <encoding>.
            <encoding> is either "unicode" or any valid 8bit encoding.

     -1, --id3v1-encoding <encoding>
            Write id3v1 tag in <encoding>, if <encoding> is "none", then strip
            id3v1 tag away. <encoding> may be any valid 8bit encoding, note
            however that it is not possible to write id3v1 in Unicode.

     -2, --id3v2-encoding <encoding>
            Write id3v2 tag in <encoding>, if <encoding> is "none", then strip
            id3v2 tag away. <encoding> may be either "unicode" or any valid
            8bit encoding.

     -p, --preserve-unicode
            If source encoding is specified to be some specific encoding and
            not Unicode, but the actual encoding seems to be Unicode, then
            assume it is Unicode. E.g., if you want to process a lot of files,
            some of which are in Unicode (or have Unicode characters
            somewhere), but some are in cp1251, just issue -s cp1251 -p along
            with other options. This should work as you would like it to work.

     -w, --preview
            Do not modify the files, instead show the tags that would be
            written. Useful to test specified options for correctness.

     -v, --version
            Prints version number, compilation date and time.

     -q, --quiet
            Do not report what files have been processed.

EXAMPLE
     mp3unicode --source-encoding cp1251 --id3v1-encoding none
     --id3v2-encoding unicode file.mp3

     will read id3v2 tag (or id3v1 tag if there is no id3v2) from the file,
     convert the text fields in the tag from cp1251 to Unicode and will write
     id3v2 tag back, stripping away id3v1 tag.
