NAME
       countdown - count down a specified time interval

SYNOPSIS
       countdown interval

DESCRIPTION
       countdown counts down a specified time interval, then beeps and exits.
       I use it mainly as an egg timer.

       There are a number of different formats for specifying the time
       interval.  A plain unadorned number is interpreted as seconds.
           % countdown 30        # 30 seconds
       You can also use a single-letter suffix to indicate units.  Available
       suffices are s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours, d for days, and
       w for weeks.  Note that the number doesn't have to be an integer.
           % countdown 30s        # 30 seconds
           % countdown 0.5m       # also 30 seconds
           % countdown 12h        # twelve hours
           % countdown 0.5d       # also twelve hours
           % countdown 1.5w       # one and a half weeks
       You can also string together two adjacent time units.
           % countdown 1m30s      # 90 seconds
           % countdown 2h30m      # two and a half hours
           % countdown 1d1h       # twenty-five hours
           % countdown 1w3d       # ten days
       In addition, you can specify a time of day, rather than a duration.
           % countdown 4:20am
           % countdown 4:20pm
           % countdown 4:20
           % countdown 4:20:00am
           % countdown 4:20:00pm
           % countdown 4:20:00
