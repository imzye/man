NAME
     jack_umidi – daemon that converts a raw MIDI device into a JACK MIDI
     device.

SYNOPSIS
     jack_umidi [-d <device_name>] [-C <capture_device_name>]
                [-P <playback_device_name>] [-n <port_name>] [-k] [-B] [-S]
                [-U <username>] [-h]

DESCRIPTION
     jack_umidi is a daemon that provides access to raw USB/socket MIDI
     devices via the Jack system.  The daemon will not exit when a device
     becomes unavailable, but will wait until the device re-appears again.

     The following options are available:

     -k      Terminate the client when the first capture or playback device is
             no longer available.  Else the client will try to re-connect.

     -B      Run the client in background mode.

     -S      Create 16 JACK subdevices for the capture device. One for each
             MIDI channel.

     -d      Specify the device name of the USB device to use, for example
             /dev/umidi0.0 .

     -C      Specify the capture only device name of the USB device to use,
             for example /dev/umidi0.0 .

     -n      Specify a custom port name when registering with the JACK server.
             The default value is "jack_midi".

     -P      Specify the playback only device name of the USB device to use,
             for example /dev/umidi0.0 .

     -U      Specify which JACK user the program should attach to.  Default is
             same as running user.

     -h      Print help text showing available options.

EXAMPLES
           # Start Jack MIDI client in background mode
           jack_umidi -d /dev/umidi0.0 -B

           # List all available JACK ports
           jack_lsp

           # Connect two JACK ports
           jack_connect port1 port2
