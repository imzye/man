         Dwarf_Error *err);

     int
     dwarf_highpc(Dwarf_Die die, Dwarf_Addr *ret_highpc, Dwarf_Error *err);

     int
     dwarf_highpc_b(Dwarf_Die die, Dwarf_Addr *ret_highpc,
         Dwarf_Half *ret_form, enum Dwarf_Form_Class *ret_class,
         Dwarf_Error *err);

     int
     dwarf_lowpc(Dwarf_Die die, Dwarf_Addr *ret_lowpc, Dwarf_Error *err);

     int
     dwarf_srclang(Dwarf_Die die, Dwarf_Unsigned *ret_lang, Dwarf_Error *err);

DESCRIPTION
     These convenience functions are used to retrieve DWARF attribute values
     associated with a Debugging Information Entry (DIE) descriptor denoted by
     argument die.  These functions store the value of the requested attribute
     into the location pointed to by their second argument, provided that the
     requested attribute exists in the debugging information entry.

     The list of functions and the DWARF attribute that they retrieve are:

     dwarf_arrayorder()    Retrieve the DW_AT_ordering attribute value.
     dwarf_bitoffset()     Retrieve the DW_AT_bit_offset attribute value.
     dwarf_bitsize()       Retrieve the DW_AT_bit_size attribute value.
     dwarf_bytesize()      Retrieve the DW_AT_byte_size attribute value.
     dwarf_highpc()        Retrieve the DW_AT_high_pc attribute value.
     dwarf_highpc_b()      Retrieve the DW_AT_high_pc attribute value.
     dwarf_lowpc()         Retrieve the DW_AT_low_pc attribute value.
     dwarf_srclang()       Retrieve the DW_AT_language attribute value.

     Function dwarf_highpc_b() is an enhanced version of function
     dwarf_highpc().  It sets the location specified by argument ret_form to
     the form code of the attribute DW_AT_high_pc, and sets the location
     specified by argument ret_class to the class of that form.  A value of
     NULL may be used for either of the arguments ret_form or ret_class if the
     caller is not interested in the respective value.

RETURN VALUES
     These functions return DW_DLV_OK on success.

     If the debugging information entry descriptor denoted by argument die
     does not contain the requested attribute, these functions return
     DW_DLV_NO_ENTRY and set argument err.  For other errors, they return
     DW_DLV_ERROR and set argument err.

ERRORS
     These functions can fail with the following errors:

     [DW_DLE_ARGUMENT]       Arguments die, ret_highpc, ret_lowpc, ret_size,
                             ret_lang or ret_order were NULL.

     [DW_DLE_NO_ENTRY]       Argument die had no requested attribute.
