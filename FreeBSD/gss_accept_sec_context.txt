NAME
     gss_accept_sec_context – Accept a security context initiated by a peer
     application

SYNOPSIS
     #include <gssapi/gssapi.h>

     OM_uint32
     gss_accept_sec_context(OM_uint32 *minor_status,
         gss_ctx_id_t *context_handle,
         const gss_cred_id_t acceptor_cred_handle,
         const gss_buffer_t input_token_buffer,
         const gss_channel_bindings_t input_chan_bindings,
         const gss_name_t *src_name, gss_OID *mech_type,
         gss_buffer_t output_token, OM_uint32 *ret_flags, OM_uint32 *time_rec,
         gss_cred_id_t *delegated_cred_handle);

DESCRIPTION
     Allows a remotely initiated security context between the application and
     a remote peer to be established.  The routine may return a output_token
     which should be transferred to the peer application, where the peer
     application will present it to gss_init_sec_context(3).  If no token need
     be sent, gss_accept_sec_context() will indicate this by setting the
     length field of the output_token argument to zero.  To complete the
     context establishment, one or more reply tokens may be required from the
     peer application; if so, gss_accept_sec_context() will return a status
     flag of GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED, in which case it should be called again
     when the reply token is received from the peer application, passing the
     token to gss_accept_sec_context() via the input_token parameters.

     Portable applications should be constructed to use the token length and
     return status to determine whether a token needs to be sent or waited
     for.  Thus a typical portable caller should always invoke
     gss_accept_sec_context() within a loop:

     gss_ctx_id_t context_hdl = GSS_C_NO_CONTEXT;

     do {
       receive_token_from_peer(input_token);
       maj_stat = gss_accept_sec_context(&min_stat,
                                         &context_hdl,
                                         cred_hdl,
                                         input_token,
                                         input_bindings,
                                         &client_name,
                                         &mech_type,
                                         output_token,
                                         &ret_flags,
                                         &time_rec,
                                         &deleg_cred);
       if (GSS_ERROR(maj_stat)) {
         report_error(maj_stat, min_stat);
       };
       if (output_token->length != 0) {
         send_token_to_peer(output_token);

         gss_release_buffer(&min_stat, output_token);
       };
       if (GSS_ERROR(maj_stat)) {
         if (context_hdl != GSS_C_NO_CONTEXT)
           gss_delete_sec_context(&min_stat,
                                  &context_hdl,
                                  GSS_C_NO_BUFFER);
         break;
       };
     } while (maj_stat & GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED);

     Whenever the routine returns a major status that includes the value
     GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED, the context is not fully established and the
     following restrictions apply to the output parameters:

     The value returned via the time_rec parameter is undefined unless the
     accompanying ret_flags parameter contains the bit GSS_C_PROT_READY_FLAG,
     indicating that per-message services may be applied in advance of a
     successful completion status, the value returned via the mech_type
     parameter may be undefined until the routine returns a major status value
     of GSS_S_COMPLETE.

     The values of the GSS_C_DELEG_FLAG, GSS_C_MUTUAL_FLAG, GSS_C_REPLAY_FLAG,
     GSS_C_SEQUENCE_FLAG, GSS_C_CONF_FLAG, GSS_C_INTEG_FLAG and
     GSS_C_ANON_FLAG bits returned via the ret_flags parameter should contain
     the values that the implementation expects would be valid if context
     establishment were to succeed.

     The values of the GSS_C_PROT_READY_FLAG and GSS_C_TRANS_FLAG bits within
     ret_flags should indicate the actual state at the time
     gss_accept_sec_context() returns, whether or not the context is fully
     established.

     Although this requires that GSS-API implementations set the
     GSS_C_PROT_READY_FLAG in the final ret_flags returned to a caller (i.e.
     when accompanied by a GSS_S_COMPLETE status code), applications should
     not rely on this behavior as the flag was not defined in Version 1 of the
     GSS-API.  Instead, applications should be prepared to use per-message
     services after a successful context establishment, according to the
     GSS_C_INTEG_FLAG and GSS_C_CONF_FLAG values.

     All other bits within the ret_flags argument should be set to zero.
     While the routine returns GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED, the values returned via
     the ret_flags argument indicate the services that the implementation
     expects to be available from the established context.

     If the initial call of gss_accept_sec_context() fails, the implementation
     should not create a context object, and should leave the value of the
     context_handle parameter set to GSS_C_NO_CONTEXT to indicate this.  In
     the event of a failure on a subsequent call, the implementation is
     permitted to delete the "half-built" security context (in which case it
     should set the context_handle parameter to GSS_C_NO_CONTEXT ), but the
     preferred behavior is to leave the security context (and the
     context_handle parameter) untouched for the application to delete (using
     gss_delete_sec_context(3) ).

     During context establishment, the informational status bits
     GSS_S_OLD_TOKEN and GSS_S_DUPLICATE_TOKEN indicate fatal errors, and GSS-
     API mechanisms should always return them in association with a routine
     error of GSS_S_FAILURE. This requirement for pairing did not exist in
     version 1 of the GSS-API specification, so applications that wish to run
     over version 1 implementations must special-case these codes.

PARAMETERS
     context_handle           Context handle for new context.  Supply
                              GSS_C_NO_CONTEXT for first call; use value
                              returned in subsequent calls.  Once
                              gss_accept_sec_context() has returned a value
                              via this parameter, resources have been assigned
                              to the corresponding context, and must be freed
                              by the application after use with a call to
                              gss_delete_sec_context(3).

     acceptor_cred_handle     Credential handle claimed by context acceptor.
                              Specify GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL to accept the
                              context as a default principal.  If
                              GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL is specified, but no default
                              acceptor principal is defined, GSS_S_NO_CRED
                              will be returned.

     input_token_buffer       Token obtained from remote application.

     input_chan_bindings      Application-specified bindings.  Allows
                              application to securely bind channel
                              identification information to the security
                              context.  If channel bindings are not used,
                              specify GSS_C_NO_CHANNEL_BINDINGS.

     src_name                 Authenticated name of context initiator.  After
                              use, this name should be deallocated by passing
                              it to gss_release_name(3).  If not required,
                              specify NULL.

     mech_type                Security mechanism used.  The returned OID value
                              will be a pointer into static storage, and
                              should be treated as read-only by the caller (in
                              particular, it does not need to be freed).  If
                              not required, specify NULL.

     output_token             Token to be passed to peer application.  If the
                              length field of the returned token buffer is 0,
                              then no token need be passed to the peer
                              application.  If a non-zero length field is
                              returned, the associated storage must be freed
                              after use by the application with a call to
                              gss_release_buffer(3).

     ret_flags                Contains various independent flags, each of
                              which indicates that the context supports a
                              specific service option.  If not needed, specify
                              NULL.  Symbolic names are provided for each
                              flag, and the symbolic names corresponding to
                              the required flags should be logically-ANDed
                              with the ret_flags value to test whether a given
                              option is supported by the context.  The flags
                              are:

                                         routine

                                  False  No confidentiality service (via

                                  True   The initiator does not wish to be
                                         authenticated; the src_name parameter
                                         (if requested) contains an anonymous
                                         internal name.

                                         return value is GSS_S_COMPLETE.

                                  True   The resultant security context may be
                                         transferred to other processes via a
                                         call to gss_export_sec_context(3).

                              All other bits should be set to zero.

     time_rec                 Number of seconds for which the context will

                              case an explicit credential handle (i.e. not
                              GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL) will be returned; if false,
                              gss_accept_context() will set this parameter to
                              GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL.  If a credential handle is
                              returned, the associated resources must be
                              released by the application after use with a
                              call to gss_release_cred(3).  Specify NULL if
                              not required.

     minor_status             Mechanism specific status code.

RETURN VALUES
     GSS_S_CONTINUE_NEEDED           Indicates that a token from the peer
                                     application is required to complete the
                                     context, and that gss_accept_sec_context
                                     must be called again with that token.

     GSS_S_DEFECTIVE_TOKEN           Indicates that consistency checks
                                     performed on the input_token failed.

     GSS_S_DEFECTIVE_CREDENTIAL      Indicates that consistency checks
                                     performed on the credential failed.

     GSS_S_NO_CRED                   The supplied credentials were not valid
                                     for context acceptance, or the credential
                                     handle did not reference any credentials.

     GSS_S_CREDENTIALS_EXPIRED       The referenced credentials have expired.

     GSS_S_BAD_BINDINGS              The input_token contains different
                                     channel bindings to those specified via
                                     the input_chan_bindings parameter.

     GSS_S_NO_CONTEXT                Indicates that the supplied context
                                     handle did not refer to a valid context.

     GSS_S_BAD_SIG                   The input_token contains an invalid MIC.

     GSS_S_OLD_TOKEN                 The input_token was too old.  This is a
                                     fatal error during context establishment.

     GSS_S_DUPLICATE_TOKEN           The input_token is valid, but is a
                                     duplicate of a token already processed.
                                     This is a fatal error during context
                                     establishment.

     GSS_S_BAD_MECH                  The received token specified a mechanism
                                     that is not supported by the
                                     implementation or the provided
                                     credential.
