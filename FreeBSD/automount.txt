AUTOMOUNT(8)            FreeBSD System Manager's Manual           AUTOMOUNT(8)

NAME
     automount – update autofs mounts

SYNOPSIS
     automount [-D name=value] [-L] [-c] [-f] [-o options] [-v] [-u]

DESCRIPTION
     When called without options, the automount command parses the
     auto_master(5) configuration file and any direct maps that it references,
     and mounts or unmounts autofs(5) filesystems to match.  These options are
     available:

     -D     Define a variable.  It is only useful with -L.

     -L     Do not mount or unmount anything.  Instead parse auto_master(5)
            and any direct maps, then print them to standard output.  When
            specified more than once, all the maps, including indirect ones,
            will be parsed and shown.  This is useful when debugging
            configuration problems.

     -c     Flush caches, discarding possibly stale information obtained from
            maps and directory services.

     -f     Force unmount, to be used with -u.

     -o     Specify mount options to be used along with the ones specified in
            the maps.  It is only useful with -L.

     -u     Try to unmount filesystems mounted by automountd(8).  autofs(5)
            mounts are not unmounted.  To unmount all autofs mounts, use
            umount -At autofs.

     -v     Increase verbosity.

EXIT STATUS
     The automount utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Unmount all filesystems mounted by automountd(8):
           automount -u
