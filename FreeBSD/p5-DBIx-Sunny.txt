NAME
       DBIx::Sunny - Simple DBI wrapper

SYNOPSIS
           use DBIx::Sunny;

           my $dbh = DBIx::Sunny->connect(...);

           # or

           use DBI;

           my $dbh = DBI->connect(.., {
               RootClass => 'DBIx::Sunny',
               PrintError => 0,
               RaiseError => 1,
           });

DESCRIPTION
       DBIx::Sunny is a simple DBI wrapper. It provides better usability for
       you. This module based on Amon2::DBI.  DBIx::Sunny supports only SQLite
       and MySQL.

FEATURES
       Set AutoInactiveDestroy to true.
           DBIx::Sunny sets AutoInactiveDestroy as true.

       [SQLite/MySQL/Pg] Auto encode/decode UTF-8
           DBIx::Sunny sets sqlite_unicode, mysql_enable_utf8 and
           pg_enable_utf8 automatically.

       [SQLite] Performance tuning
           DBIx::Sunny sets sqlite_use_immediate_transaction to true, and
           executes these PRAGMA statements

             PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL
             PRAGMA synchronous = NORMAL

       Nested transaction management.
           DBIx::Sunny supports nested transaction management based on RAII
           like DBIx::Class or DBIx::Skinny. It uses DBIx::TransactionManager
           internally.

       Error Handling
           DBIx::Sunny sets RaiseError and ShowErrorStatement as true.
           DBIx::Sunny raises exception and shows current statement if your
           $dbh occurred exception.

       SQL comment
           DBIx::Sunny adds file name and line number as SQL comment that
           invokes SQL statement.

       Easy access to last_insert_id
           DBIx::Sunny's last_insert_id needs no arguments. It's shortcut for
           mysql_insertid or last_insert_rowid.

       Auto expanding arrayref bind parameters
           select_(one|row|all) and  query methods support auto-expanding
           arrayref bind parameters.

             $dbh->select_all('SELECT * FROM id IN (?)', [1 2 3])
             #SQL: 'SELECT * FROM id IN (?,?,?)'
             #@BIND: (1, 2, 3)

       Named placeholder
           select_(one|row|all) and query methods support named placeholder.

             $dbh->select_all('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id IN (:ids) AND status = :status', {
                 ids    => [1,2,3],
                 status => 'active',
             });
             #SQL: 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id IN (?,?,?) AND status = ?'
             #@BIND: (1, 2, 3, 'active')

       Typed bind parameters
           DBIx::Sunny allows you to specify data types of bind parameters. If
           a bind parameter is SQL::Maker::SQLType object, its value is passed
           as its type, otherwise it is passed as default type (VARCHAR).

             use SQL::Maker::SQLType qw/sql_type/;
             use DBI qw/:sql_types/

             $dbh->query(
                 'INSERT INTO bin_table (bin_col) VALUES (?)',
                 sql_type(\"\xDE\xAD\xBE\xEF", SQL_BINARY)),
             );

ADDITIONAL METHODS
       "$col = $dbh->select_one($query, @bind);"
           Shortcut for prepare, execute and fetchrow_arrayref->[0]

       "$row = $dbh->select_row($query, @bind);"
           Shortcut for prepare, execute and fetchrow_hashref

       "$rows = $dbh->select_all($query, @bind);"
           Shortcut for prepare, execute and "selectall_arrayref(.., { Slice
           => {} }, ..)"

       "$model = $dbh->select_row_as($model_class, $query, @bind);"
           Shortcut for "$model_class->new(%{ $dbh->select_row($query, @bind)
           })";

       "$models = $dbh->select_all_as($model_class, $query, @bind);"
           Shortcut for "[ map { $model_class->new(%$_) } @{
           $dbh->select_all($query, @bind) } ];"

       "$dbh->query($query, @bind);"
           Shortcut for prepare, execute.
