HCS12MEM(1)                      User Commands                     HCS12MEM(1)

NAME
       hcs12mem - Freescale S12 MCU family memory reader/writer

SYNOPSIS
       hcs12mem [ option | filename ] ...

DESCRIPTION
       hcs12mem is a tool for operating on Freescale S12 MCU's internal
       memories (EEPROM and FLASH). It can:
       - load any program into S12 RAM and execute it,
       - erase, read, write EEPROM, set EEPROM protection,
       - erase, read, write FLASH,
       - secure and unsecure whole MCU.

SUPPORTED INTERFACES
       hcs12mem can communicate with the target device using BDM link or
       serial port.

       BDM POD

       Using BDM link requires special interface device - so called BDM POD.
       Supported BDM PODs are:

              tbdml - Daniel Malik's TBDML (Turbo BDM Light USB POD), see
              http://www.freegeeks.org

              bdm12pod - Kevin Ross's BDM12 POD, see http://www.kevinro.com

              podex-bug - original Marek Peca's PODEX (with firmware bugs that
              significantly slow the communication down), see
              http://www.duch.cz/podex/

              podex - PODEX with improved firmware, with my fixes for memory
              access bugs found in original design, see
              http://cml.mfk.net.pl/podex

              podex-25 - special PODEX version dedicated for fixed 25MHz
              target (especially MC9S12NE64), see http://cml.mfk.net.pl/podex

       BOOTLOADER (Freescale's LRAE via serial port)

       hcs12mem supports operations on target memory using Freescale's LRAE
       (Load RAM And Execute) bootloader, using serial port connection (SCI0
       on target hardware). Prior to all operations, presence of LRAE
       bootloader is required in target's FLASH memory. LRAE is available for
       a wide selection of S12 MCUs. Source code, S-record files and
       description can be obtained from Freescale as Application Note -
       AN2546. This bootloader is supposedly loaded into new S12 MCUs as last
       stage of factory processing, thus some "fresh" parts straight from
       Freescale should have this bootloader already in FLASH memory.

       MONITOR (Freescale's serial monitor - AN2548)

       hcs12mem supports operations on target memory using Freescale's serial
       monitor (AN2548). This monitor uses serial port connection (SCI0 on
       target hardware).  Prior to all operations, presence of serial monitor
       is required in target's FLASH memory. Monitor is available for a wide
       selection of S12 MCUs.  Source code, S-record files and description can
       be obtained from Freescale as Application Note - AN2548. Port of the
       source code to GNU tools is available, see "SEE ALSO" section.

SUPPORTED MCUs
       Support for various S12 derivatives is dependent on target device
       connection.

       BDM

       hcs12mem running via BDM supports almost all S12 derivatives (not all
       are tested, though, especially parts with multiple FLASH blocks are not
       tested):

       <MC9S12> A32, A64, A128, A256, A512, C32, C64, C96, C128, GC16, GC32,
       GC64, GC96, GC128, D32, D64, D128, D256, D512, E32, E64, E128, E256,
       H128, H256, UF32, NE64.

       LRAE BOOTLOADER

       hcs12mem using LRAE supports all derivatives that can run LRAE,
       according to AN2546 (maybe some others too, if LRAE can work on them):

       <MC9S12> A32, A64, A128, A256, A512, C32, C128, D32, D64, D128, D256,
       D512, E128.

       SERIAL MONITOR

       hcs12mem using serial monitor supports all derivatives that can run
       serial monitor. AN2548 has variants of serial monitor for the following
       targets (compiling dedicated version for other target is easy):

       <MC9S12> C32, D32, D64, D128, D256, D512, E128, H256.

       My port to GNU tools adds support for A64 and NE64.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Show usage info.

       -q, --quiet
              Be quiet (no progress/status messages).

       -f, --force
              Force operation, if questionable.

       -i <interface>, --interface <interface>
              Use given interface for target connection. Supported ones are:

              lrae - Freescale's LRAE (Load RAM And Execute) boot loader
              (AN2546)

              sm - Freescale's serial monitor (AN2548)

              tbdml - Daniel Malik's TBDML (Turbo BDM Light) USB POD

              bdm12pod - original Kevin Ross's BDM12 POD

              podex - PODEX with firmware bugfixes

              podex-bug - original Marek Peca's PODEX (with memory access
              bugs)

              podex-25 - special PODEX version dedicated for 25MHz target

              See more below in SUPPORTED INTERFACES section.
              This option is mandatory and must be specified exactly once.

       -p <port>, --port <port>
              Use given serial port for target connection. Port is a path to
              device special file, typically /dev/something

       -b <bps>, --baud <bps>
              Use given baud rate for serial port connection. This is
              optional, and must correspond with target interface baud rate.
              Value is specified in bits-per-second, for example 115200, 9600,
              etc.

       -t <target>, --target <target>
              Use given target description. Target description is a file with
              some key-value pairs, determining configuration.  target can be
              specified in two ways: direct file name (this file is used as
              target description), or target nick name (target description
              file name is created by appending .doc to the target argument,
              then looked up in program's data directory).

              For example, -t some_file_name.dat will treat this file as
              target description, and -t some_other_target will look for
              /usr/local/share/hcs12mem/some_other_target.dat file, if that's
              where program data files are located.

       -o <freq>, --osc <freq>
              Specify target device oscillator frequency, if interface
              requires it and cannot auto-detect it.  freq can be specified
              directly as value in Hz, or suffix [k|kHz|M|MHz] can be used,
              for example these all are equivalent: -o 8000000, -o 8000kHz, -o
              8MHz

       -j <addr>, --start-address <addr>
              Use this start address for program loaded into RAM, if this
              address is not specified by S-record file.

       -a <type>, --flash-address <type>
              Use address type when reading/writing S-record file:

              non-banked - FLASH linear area within 64kB, without banking
              banked-linear - Freescale banked linear format
              banked-ppage - banked format with PPAGE value as MSB

              This selection refers to addresses within S-record file.
              When not specified, non-banked addressing is used.

       -e, --include-erased
              Include erased areas of memory in written S-record file (default
              is to skip 0xff blocks). Using this option, one gets S-record
              file with every byte defined to explicit value.

       -s <size>, --srecord-size <size>
              Specify size of single S-record written to file, default: 16.

       -v, --verify
              Verify result of all erase/write operations.

       Following options can be specified multiple times, any of them,
       processing is according to occurence order:

       -R, --reset <file>
              Reset target into normal mode.

       -U, --unsecure
              Unsecure secured microcontroller. This means erasing EEPROM and
              FLASH memories as part of the process !

       -S, --secure
              Secure the microcontroller. This means disabling access to
              EEPROM and FLASH memories, any further access requires
              unsecuring first.

       -X <file>, --ram-run <file>
              Load S-record file into RAM and execute. Addresses of data to
              load must correspond to target MCU RAM area. Program is run from
              address supplied in apropriate S-record, it can be overriden
              using -j option.

       -A, --eeprom-erase
              Erase internal MCU EEPROM memory.

       -B <file>, --eeprom-read <file>
              Read internal MCU EEPROM memory contents into S-record file

       -C <file>, --eeprom-write <file>
              Write internal MCU EEPROM memory contents from S-record file

       -D <range>, --eeprom-protect <range>
              Write EEPROM protection byte, range can be one of the following:
              <all|64B|128B|192B|256B|320B|384B|448B|512B>

              all - protects whole EEPROM array
              xxxB - protects last xxx bytes of EEPROM array

       -E, --flash-erase
              Erase entire FLASH memory, leave security byte in unprogrammed
              state (0xff) thus leaving whole MCU in secured state.

       -F, --flash-erase-unsecure
              Erase entire FLASH memory, then program security byte to
              unsecured state.  This leaves MCU in usecured state with FLASH
              memory in erased state, except security byte with value 0xfe.

       -G <file>, --flash-read <file>
              Read FLASH memory contents into S-record file.

       -H <file>, --flash-write <file>
              Write FLASH memory contents from S-record file.

       Options specific for particular interfaces:

       -Z, --keep-lrae
              Option applicable for LRAE bootloader only - when erasing FLASH
              memory, keep LRAE in memory (do not erase FLASH area containing
              LRAE image).  Default is to bulk erase whole memory, thus
              erasing LRAE.

       -Y, --tbdml-bulk
              Option applicable for TBDML USB POD only - use bulk USB
              transfers, which are violating USB specification, but give
              better data transfer rates.  Check if it works for you and use
              it if you feel good about it.  Known to work under FreeBSD and
              MS Windows, linux unfortunatelly rejects bulk transfers, but
              Your Mileage May Vary.

EXAMPLES
       There are some common options that must be specified in most cases:
       interface type, interface port, target type, target oscillator
       frequency (if interface requires it and cannot auto-detect). Almost
       every call requires these, so for clarity they will be stated only once
       as an example, and omitted in the following examples, substituted by
       [-ipto] symbol.

       BDM

       Depending on the interface in use, different options are required:

       TBDML - interface type and target type are required, no port
       specification is required (USB bus is assumed), no target frequency is
       required (TBDML can auto-detect it), but it can be overriden with -o
       option, if auto-detection fails and TBDML is unable to connect the
       target.

       BDM12, PODEX - required are: interface type, target type, interface
       connection port and target frequency.

       Two examples of these options for TBDML and PODEX follows: first
       example - interface is PODEX, serial port for PODEX attachment is
       /dev/uart0, target is MC9S12A64 MCU operating at 16MHz; second example
       - interface is TBDML (assumed connection via USB), target is MC9S12A64
       MCU, operating frequency is auto-detected.  hcs12mem call usually
       requires some more action commands to do something specific, but such
       call with these options only is convenient for verifying target
       communication - it initializes the target, displays all the info and
       quits:

              hcs12mem -i podex -p /dev/uart0 -t mc9s12a64 -o 16MHz

              hcs12mem -i tbdml -t mc9s12a64

       Unsecure secured microcontroller:

              hcs12mem [-ipto] --unsecure

       Secure unsecured microcontroller:

              hcs12mem [-ipto] --secure

       Load some code into target RAM and execute:

              hcs12mem [-ipto] --ram-run some_code.s19

       Read EEPROM contents:

              hcs12mem [-ipto] --eeprom-read eeprom_data.s19

       Set EEPROM protection:

              hcs12mem [-ipto] --eeprom-protect all

       Read data from FLASH memory and write it to S-record file, use
       Freescale banked linear addresses, write all erased 0xff's to output
       file (default is to skip them):

              hcs12mem [-ipto] -e --flash-address banked-linear --flash-read
              flash_data.s19

       Write data from S-record file to FLASH memory (non-banked flat
       addressing, option -a non-banked assumed by default):

              hcs12mem [-ipto] --flash-write flash_data.s19

       Action options can be specified multiple times, they are executed in
       specified order, for example - erase FLASH, write program into FLASH
       and reset target, thus immediatelly starting program execution:

              hcs12mem [-ipto] --flash-erase --flash-write program.s19 --reset

       LRAE BOOTLOADER (AN2546)

       Using LRAE serial bootloader, we specify following common options:

              hcs12mem -i lrae -p /dev/uart0 -t mc9s12a64 -o 16MHz

       Baud rate for serial connection is automatically calculated by
       hcs12mem, using supplied oscillator frequency as reference. You can
       override auto-selected baud rate with -b <baud> option, if some other
       speed is preferred.

       Load your program into target RAM, and execute it:

              hcs12mem [-ipto] --ram-run program.s19

       Write your program into target FLASH, keeping LRAE in FLASH:

              hcs12mem [-ipto] --flash-erase --keep-lrae --flash-write
              program.s19

       Bulk erase FLASH memory, load LRAE and your program:

              hcs12mem [-ipto] --flash-erase --flash-write lrae.s19 --flash-
              write program.s19

       NOTES: reloading FLASH program using LRAE is tricky, because when your
       program is loaded into FLASH, LRAE is not running anymore. Thus, if you
       want to reuse LRAE, your program must have a way to enter LRAE on
       request, for example push button tested as very first thing in your
       program or something like that.  Also, every hcs12mem call using LRAE
       requires preceding manual target reset.

       Writing program destined to be loaded into FLASH memory in coexistence
       with LRAE bootloader has special requirements (memory layout, MCU
       initialization), see Application Note AN2546 for more details.

       SERIAL MONITOR (AN2548)

       Using serial monitor, we specify following common options (oscillator
       frequency is not required):

              hcs12mem -i sm -p /dev/uart0 -t mc9s12a64

       Baud rate for serial connection is 115200bps by default. If you have
       special version of serial monitor compiled with some other settings,
       you can override auto-selected baud rate with -b <baud> option.

       Using serial monitor, there's no way to erase it, except via BDM, and:
       - erasing FLASH erases only parts of memory outside serial monitor
       (--flash-erase and --flash-erase-unsecure do the same)
       - erasing FLASH erases also EEPROM ! (this is how serial monitor
       implements this)
       - securing and unsecuring MCU is not supported

       Erase EEPROM, write some initial data and protect upper 256 bytes of
       EEPROM:

              hcs12mem [-ipto] --eeprom-erase --eeprom-write eeprom.s19
              --eeprom-protect 256B

       Erase FLASH (EEPROM gets erased too), write your program and reset
       target (thus starting your program):

              hcs12mem [-ipt] --flash-erase --flash-write program.s19 --reset

       Writing program destined to be loaded into FLASH memory in coexistence
       with serial monitor has special requirements (memory layout, MCU
       initialization), see Application Note AN2548 for more details.

BUGS, NOTES, TODO
       FLASH write verify is not implemented yet.
       MCUs with more that single FLASH block are barely tested.
