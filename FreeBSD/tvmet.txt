NAME
       tvmet-config - script to get information about the installed version of
       tvmet

SYNOPSIS
       tvmet-config [--prefix[=DIR]] [--exec-prefix[=DIR]] [--version]
       [--libs] [--cxxflags]

DESCRIPTION
       tvmet-config is a tool that is used to configure to determine the
       compiler and linker flags that should be used to compile and link
       programs that use tvmet. It is also used internally to the .m4 macros
       for GNU autoconf that are included with tvmet.

OPTIONS
       tvmet-config accepts the following options:

       --version
               Print the currently installed version of tvmet on the standard
               output.

       --libs  Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a tvmet
               program.

       --cxxflags
               Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a tvmet
               program.

       --prefix
               Print the prefix with which tvmet was compiled.

       --prefix=PREFIX
               If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix
               that tvmet was built with when computing the output for the
               --cflags and --libs options. This option is also used for the
               exec prefix if --exec-prefix was not specified. This option
               must be specified before any --libs or --cflags options.

       --exec-prefix
               Print the exec-prefix with which tvmet was compiled.

       --exec-prefix=PREFIX
               If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation exec
               prefix that tvmet was built with when computing the output for
               the --cflags and --libs options.  This option must be specified
               before any --libs or --cflags options.
