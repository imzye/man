DESCRIPTION
       chips is an Xorg driver for Chips and Technologies video processors.
       The majority of the Chips and Technologies chipsets are supported by
       this driver. In general the limitation on the capabilities of this
       driver are determined by the chipset on which it is run. Where
       possible, this driver provides full acceleration and supports the
       following depths: 1, 4, 8, 15, 16, 24 and on the latest chipsets an
       8+16 overlay mode. All visual types are supported for depth 1, 4 and 8
       and both TrueColor and DirectColor visuals are supported where
       possible. Multi-head configurations are supported on PCI or AGP buses.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
       The chips driver supports video processors on most of the bus types
       currently available.  The chipsets supported fall into one of three
       architectural classes. A basic architecture, the WinGine architecture
       and the newer HiQV architecture.

       Basic Architecture

       The supported chipsets are ct65520, ct65525, ct65530, ct65535, ct65540,
       ct65545, ct65546 and ct65548

       Color depths 1, 4 and 8 are supported on all chipsets, while depths 15,
       16 and 24 are supported only on the 65540, 65545, 65546 and 65548
       chipsets. The driver is accelerated when used with the 65545, 65546 or
       65548 chipsets, however the DirectColor visual is not available.

       Wingine Architecture

       The supported chipsets are ct64200 and ct64300

       Color depths 1, 4 and 8 are supported on both chipsets, while depths
       15, 16 and 24 are supported only on the 64300 chipsets. The driver is
       accelerated when used with the 64300 chipsets, however the DirectColor
       visual is not available.

       HiQV Architecture

       The supported chipsets are ct65550, ct65554, ct65555, ct68554, ct69000
       and ct69030

       Color depths 1, 4, 8, 15, 16, 24 and 8+16 are supported on all
       chipsets.  The DirectColor visual is supported on all color depths
       except the 8+16 overlay mode. Full acceleration is supplied for all
       chipsets.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for general configuration details.  This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The driver auto-detects the chipset type, but the following ChipSet
       names may optionally be specified in the config file "Device" section,
       and will override the auto-detection:

           "ct65520", "ct65525", "ct65530", "ct65535", "ct65540", "ct65545",
           "ct65546", "ct65548", "ct65550", "ct65554", "ct65555", "ct68554",
           "ct69000", "ct69030", "ct64200", "ct64300".

       The driver will auto-detect the amount of video memory present for all
       chipsets.  But maybe overridden with the VideoRam entry in the config
       file "Device" section.

       The following driver Options are supported, on one or more of the
       supported chipsets:

       Option "NoAccel" "boolean"

       Option "UseVclk1" "boolean"
              Use the Vclk1 programmable clock on HiQV chipsets instead of
              Vclk2. Default: off

       Option "FPClock8" "float"

       Option "FPClock16" "float"

       Option "FPClock24" "float"

       Option "FPClock32" "float"

              flat panel at a specified depth

       Option "MMIO" "boolean"
              Force the use of memory mapped IO for acceleration registers.
              Default: off

       Option "FullMMIO" "boolean"
              Force the use of memory mapped IO where it can be used. Default:
              off

       Option "SuspendHack" "boolean"
              Force driver to leave centering and stretching registers alone.
              This can fix some laptop suspend/resume problems. Default: off

       Option "ColorKey" "integer"
              Set the colormap index used for the transparency key for the
              depth 8 plane when operating in 8+16 overlay mode.  The value
              must be in the range 2-255.  Default: 255.

       Option "VideoKey" "integer"
              This sets the default pixel value for the YUV video overlay key.
              Default: undefined.

       Option "ShadowFB" "boolean"
              Enable or disable use of the shadow framebuffer layer.  Default:
              off.

       Option "SyncOnGreen" "boolean"
              Enable or disable combining the sync signals with the green
              signal.  Default: off.

       Option "ShowCache" "boolean"
              Enable or disable viewing offscreen memory. Used for debugging
              only Default: off.

       Option "18bitBus" "boolean"
              Force the driver to assume that the flat panel has an 18bit data
              bus.  Default: off.

       Option "Crt2Memory" "integer"
              In a dual-head mode (69030 only) this option selects the amount
              of memory to set aside for the second head. If not specified,
              half the memory is used.  Default: off.

       Option "DualRefresh" "integer"
              The 69030 supports independent refresh rates on its two display
              channels.  This mode of operations uses additional memory
              bandwidth and thus limits the maximum colour depth and refresh
              rate that can be achieved, and so is off by default.  Using this
              option forces the use of an independent refresh rate on the two
              screens.  Default: off.

       Option "FpMode" "boolean"
              The driver probes the chip to find out if a flat panel (LCD) is
              connected and active. If this is true it limits the possible
              screen size to the maximum resolution of the panel. The chips is
              initialized by the BIOS which may set the chip to 'dual' mode
              even if no panel is connected. In this case the available
              resolution on the CRT is limited to the panel size the BIOS has
              set. To tell the driver that no panel is connected despite of
              what the BIOS is saying set this option to off. Don't set it to
              off if a panel is connected.  Default: value probed by BIOS.
