NAME
       Test::PerlTidy - check that all your files are tidy.

VERSION
       version 20230226

SYNOPSIS
           # In a file like 't/perltidy.t':

           use Test::PerlTidy qw( run_tests );

           run_tests();

DESCRIPTION
       This rather unflattering comment was made in a piece by Ken Arnold:

           "Perl is a vast swamp of lexical and syntactic swill and nobody
           knows how to format even their own code well, but it's the only
           major language I can think of (with the possible exception of the
           recent, yet very Java-like C#) that doesn't have at least one
           style that's good enough."
                     http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=74230

       Hmmm... He is sort of right in a way. Then again the piece he wrote was
       related to Python which is somewhat strict about formatting itself.

       Fear not though - now you too can have your very own formatting gestapo
       in the form of Test::PerlTidy! Simply add a test file as suggested
       above and any file ending in .pl, .pm, .t or .PL will cause a test fail
       unless it is exactly as perltidy would like it to be.

REASONS TO DO THIS
       If the style is mandated in tests then it will be adhered to.

       If perltidy decides what is a good style then there should be no
       quibbling.

       If the style never changes then cvs diffs stop catching changes that
       are not really there.

       Readability might even improve.

HINTS
       If you want to change the default style then muck around with
       '.perltidyrc';

       To quickly make a file work then try 'perltidy -b the_messy_file.pl'.

HOW IT WORKS
       Runs perltidy on files and reports errors if any of the files differ
       after having been tidied.  Does not permanently modify the files being
       tested.

       By default, perltidy will be run on files under the current directory
       and its subdirectories with extensions matching: ".pm .pl .PL .t"

METHODS
   run_tests ( [ %args ] )
       This is the main entry point for running tests.

       A number of options can be specified when running the tests, e.g.:

           run_tests(
                     path       => $start_dir,
                     perltidyrc => $path_to_config_file,
                     exclude    => [ qr{\.t$}, 'inc/'],
           );

       debug
           Set "debug" to a true value to enable additional diagnostic output,
           in particular info about any processing done as a result of
           specifying the "exclude" option.  Default is false.

       exclude
           run_tests() will look for files to test under the current directory
           and its subdirectories.  By default, it will exclude files in the
           ""./blib/"" directory.  Set "exclude" to a listref of exclusion
           criteria if you need to specify additional rules by which files
           will be excluded.

           If an item in the "exclude" list is a string, e.g. ""./blib/"", it
           will be assumed to be a path prefix.  Files will be excluded if
           that string matches their path at the beginning.

           If an item in the "exclude" list is a regex object, e.g.
           ""qr{\.t$}"", files will be excluded if that regex matches their
           path.

           Note that the paths of files to be tested are canonified using
           File::Spec"->canonpath" before any matching is attempted, which can
           impact how the exclusion rules apply.  If your exclusion rules do
           not seem to be working, turn on the "debug" option to see the paths
           of the files that are being kept/excluded.

       path
           Set "path" to the path to the top-level directory which contains
           the files to be tested.  Defaults to the current directory (i.e.
           ""."").

       perltidyrc
           By default, perltidy will attempt to read its options from the
           .perltidyrc file on your system.  Set "perltidyrc" to the path to a
           custom file if you would like to control the perltidy options used
           during testing.

       mute
           By default, run_tests() will output diagnostics about any errors
           reported by perltidy, as well as any actual differences found
           between the pre-tidied and post-tidied files.  Set "mute" to a true
           value to turn off that diagnostic output.

       skip_all
           Set "skip_all" to a true value to skip all tests.  Default is
           false.

       perltidy_options
           Pass these to Perl::Tidy::perltidy().  (Added in version 20200411
           .)

   list_files ( [ start_path | %args ] )
       Generate the list of files to be tested.  Generally not called
       directly.

   load_file ( path_to_file )
       Load the file to be tested from disk and return the contents.
       Generally not called directly.

   is_file_tidy ( path_to_file [ , path_to_perltidyrc ] [, $named_args] )
       Test if a file is tidy or not.  Generally not called directly.

       $named_args can be a hash ref which may have a key called
       'perltidy_options' that refers to a hash ref of options that will be
       passed to Perl::Tidy::perltidy().  ($named_args was added in version
       20200411).
