DPMS(4)                FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                DPMS(4)

NAME
     dpms – VESA BIOS DPMS driver

SYNOPSIS
     device dpms

DESCRIPTION
     The dpms driver uses the VESA BIOS to manage an external display during
     suspend and resume.  When the machine suspends, the dpms driver turns the
     external display off.  When the machine resumes, it restores the display
     to its state when the driver was first loaded.

SEE ALSO
     acpi_video(4)

BUGS
     The VESA BIOS DPMS calls do not provide any way to identify a particular
     display or adapter to manipulate.  As a result, this driver may have
     unexpected results on systems with multiple displays and/or adapters.
