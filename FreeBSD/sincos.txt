SINCOS(3)              FreeBSD Library Functions Manual              SINCOS(3)

NAME
     sincos, sincosf, sincosl – sine and cosine functions

LIBRARY
     Math Library (libm, -lm)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <math.h>

     void
     sincos(double x, double *s, double *c);

     void
     sincosf(float x, float *s, float *c);

     void
     sincosl(long double x, long double *s, long double *c);

DESCRIPTION
     The sincos(), sincosf(), and sincosl() functions compute the sine and
     cosine of x.  Using these functions allows argument reduction to occur
     only once instead of twice with individual invocations of sin() and
     cos().  Like sin() and cos(), a large magnitude argument may yield a
     result with little or no significance.

RETURN VALUES
     Upon returning from sincos(), sincosf(), and sincosl(), the memory
     pointed to by *s and *c are assigned the values of sine and cosine,
     respectively.

SEE ALSO
     cos(3), sin(3)

HISTORY
     These functions were added to FreeBSD 9.0 to aid in writing various
     complex function contained in ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (“ISO C99”).
