FWE(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 FWE(4)

NAME
     fwe – Ethernet emulation driver for FireWire

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device firewire
           device fwe

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_fwe_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The fwe driver provides non-standard Ethernet emulation over FireWire
     (IEEE 1394).

     firewire(4) and fwohci(4) must be configured in the kernel as well.

     This driver exploits asynchronous stream over IEEE 1394 to carry Ethernet
     frames.  The stream channel can be specified by the
     hw.firewire.fwe.stream_ch sysctl(8).

     This driver supports polling(4) as well if it is compiled with the
     DEVICE_POLLING option.

SEE ALSO
     arp(4), firewire(4), fwip(4), fwohci(4), netintro(4), ng_ether(4),
     polling(4), ifconfig(8), kldload(8), sysctl(8)

HISTORY
     The fwe device driver first appeared in FreeBSD 5.0.

AUTHORS
     The fwe driver and this manual page were written by Hidetoshi Shimokawa.

BUGS
     This driver emulates Ethernet in a very adhoc way and it does not reserve
     a stream channel using an isochronous manager.  Note that this driver
     uses a protocol which is very different from RFC 2734 (IPv4 over IEEE
     1394).
