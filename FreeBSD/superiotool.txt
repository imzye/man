NAME
       superiotool - Super I/O detection tool

SYNOPSIS
       superiotool [-delVvh]

DESCRIPTION
       superiotool is a GPL'd user-space utility which can

        * detect which Super I/O chip is soldered onto your mainboard,

        * at which configuration port it's located (usually 0x2e or 0x4e), and

        * dump all register contents of the Super I/O chip, together with the
          default values as per datasheet (to make comparing the values easy).

       It is mainly used for coreboot development purposes (see coreboot.org
       for details on coreboot), but it may also be useful for other things.

       The list of supported Super I/O chips is available at
       https://coreboot.org/Superiotool#Supported_devices, but it can also be
       viewed by running superiotool -l.

OPTIONS
       If no command line option is specified, superiotool merely tries to
       detect the Super I/O chip.  You must use the -d option to dump the
       Super I/O register contents.

       -d, --dump
              Dump Super I/O registers (if the Super I/O chip is detected and
              superiotool supports the --dump option for this chip). The
              output will look something like this:

              $ superiotool -d
              Found SMSC FDC37N769 (id=0x28, rev=0x01) at 0x3f0
              Register dump:
              idx 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0a 0b 0c 0d 0e 0f 10 11...
              val 20 90 80 f4 00 00 ff 00 00 00 40 00 0e 28 01 00 00 00...
              def 28 9c 88 70 00 00 ff 00 00 00 00 00 02 28 NA 00 00 80...

              The idx fields contain the register numbers/indexes of the Super
              I/O, the val fields contain the contents of the respective
              register as read from the Super I/O, and the def fields contain
              the default values for the respective register, as specified in
              the datasheet.

              The numbers in the output are all in hex format, and some
              special values may also occur: NA stands for not available
              (i.e., the datasheet doesn't specify a default value for the
              respective register), RR means reserved (the datasheet
              explicitly marks this register as reserved), and MM means misc,
              which can mean several things. It's recommended to consult the
              datasheet for detailed information about the MM fields.

       -e, --extra-dump
              Dump extra secondary register contents too, if available. Only
              in combination with the --dump option. This option will, for
              instance, dump the environmental controller (EC) configuration
              registers for the ITE IT8716F chip. The format is similar to the
              output of the --dump option.

       -l, --list-supported
              List all Super I/O chips recognized by superiotool. The phrase
              (dump available) following a chip name indicates that
              superiotool supports the --dump option for this chip.

       -V, --verbose
              Enable verbose mode. This option can be used together with the
              -d option.

              The verbose output will not only list for which type of Super
              I/O the tool is scanning, but also at which configuration port
              it's probing, and which Super I/O initialization sequence is
              used. If no Super I/O was detected in a probing run, the
              returned output will be shown, as it may be useful for figuring
              out which (currently unrecognized) Super I/O chip this may be.

       -v, --version
              Show version information and exit.

       -h, --help
              Show a help text and exit.
