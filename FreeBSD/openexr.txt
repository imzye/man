NAME
       exr2aces - convert exr images to ACES format

SYNOPSIS
       exr2aces [options] infile outfile

DESCRIPTION
       Read an OpenEXR file from infile and save the contents in ACES image
       file outfile.

       The ACES image file format is a subset of the OpenEXR file format.
       ACES image files are restricted as follows:

              * Images are stored as scanlines; tiles are not allowed.  *
              Images contain three color channels, either:

              R, G, B (red, green, blue)

              or:

              Y, RY, BY (luminance, sub-sampled chroma)

              * Images may optionally contain an alpha channel.  * Only three
              compression types are allowed:

              NO_COMPRESSION (file is not compressed) PIZ_COMPRESSION
              (lossless) B44A_COMPRESSION (lossy)

              * The "chromaticities" header attribute must specify

              the ACES RGB primaries and white point.
