LPTEST(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              LPTEST(1)

NAME
     lptest – generate lineprinter ripple pattern

SYNOPSIS
     lptest [length] [count]

DESCRIPTION
     The lptest utility writes the traditional "ripple test" pattern on
     standard output.  In 96 lines, this pattern will print all 96 printable
     ASCII characters in each position.  While originally created to test
     printers, it is quite useful for testing terminals, driving terminal
     ports for debugging purposes, or any other task where a quick supply of
     random data is needed.

     The length argument specifies the output line length if the default
     length of 79 is inappropriate.

     The count argument specifies the number of output lines to be generated
     if the default count of 200 is inappropriate.  Note that if count is to
     be specified, length must be also be specified.

HISTORY
     A lptest utility appeared in 4.3BSD.
