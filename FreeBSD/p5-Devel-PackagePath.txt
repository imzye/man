NAME
       Devel::PackagePath - Inspect and Manipulate a Path based on a Package
       Name

VERSION
       This document describes Devel::PackagePath version 0.0.1

SYNOPSIS
           use Devel::PackagePath;

           my $path = Devel::PackagePath->new( package => 'MyApp::Base::Object', base => 'lib');
           $path->create; # creates lib/MyApp/Base

DESCRIPTION
       Devel::PackagePath is a simple way to inspect and manipulate a path
       based on a package name. I went looking for a way to do this when
       building a class generator for another project and didn't find anything
       simple.

METHODS

           package PackageName
               A package name to turn into a path.

           base Str
               A base directory, defaults to '.'.

       create
           Create the path on the filesystem.

       path
           Get the path back as a string.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
       Devel::PackagePath requires no configuration files or environment
       variables.

DEPENDENCIES
