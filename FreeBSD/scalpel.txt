NAME
       scalpel - Recover files or data fragments from a disk image using file
       type-specific patterns


SYNOPSIS
       scalpel [-b] [-c <config file>] [-d] [-e] [-h] [-i <file>] [-n] [-o
       <dir>] [-O] [-p] [-q <clustersize>] [-r] [-V] [-v] [FILES]...


DESCRIPTION
       Recover files from a disk image or raw block device based on headers
       and footers specified by the user.


       -b     Carve files even if defined footers aren't discovered within
              maximum carve size for file type [foremost 0.69 compat mode].
              This option may help when fragmentary evidence is useful, but
              will increase the number of false positives.


       -c file
              Chooses which configuration file to use. If this option is
              omitted, then "scalpel.conf" in the current directory is used.
              The format for the configuration file is described in the
              default configuration file "scalpel.conf".  See the
              CONFIGURATION FILE section below for more information.


       -d     Generate header/footer database.  This option forces Scalpel to
              discover all headers and footers and write header/footer
              locations to a text file.  Since certain optimizations are
              bypassed when all footers must be discovered, performance will
              suffer.  This option does not affect the set of files that are
              carved.


       -e     Do nested header/footer matching, to deal with structured files
              that may contain embedded files of the same type.  Applicable
              only to FORWARD / NEXT patterns.


       -h     Show a help screen and exit.


       -i file
              file is used as a list of input files to examine. Each line in
              the specified file should contain a single filename.


       -o directory
              Recovered files are written to the directory directory.
              Scalpel requires that this directory be either empty or not
              exist.  The directory will be created if necessary.


       -n     Don't add extensions to extracted files.


       -o     Set output directory for carved files.  Scalpel will only write
              carved files to an empty output directory.  "scalpel-output" in
              the current directory is the default if this option is not
              specified.


       -O     Don't organize carved files by type. By default, scalpel
              organizes carved files into subdirectories, by type.


       -p     Perform an image file preview.  When this option is specified,
              the audit log indicates which files would have been carved, but
              no files are actually carved.  This option also supports in-
              place file carving.


       -q     Carve files only when the header is cluster-aligned. If you
              aren't interested in carving files embedded within other file
              types, this option should be used, as it significantly reduces
              the false positive rate.


       -r     Find only first of overlapping headers/footers [foremost 0.69
              compat mode].  This option is rarely needed.


       -V     Show copyright information and exit.


       -v     Enables verbose mode. This causes copious amounts of debugging
              information to be output.


CONFIGURATION FILE
       The configuration file is used to control the types of files Scalpel
       will attempt to carve.  A sample configuration file, "scalpel.conf", is
       included with this distribution. For each file type, the configuration
       file describes the file's extension, whether the header and footer are
       case sensitive, the minimum and maximum file sizes, and the header and
       footer for the file. Minimum carve sizes and footer fields are
       optional, but the header, maximum size, case sensitivity, and extension
       fields are required.

       Any line in the configuration file that begins with a pound sign is
       considered a comment and ignored. Please see the documentation in the
       sample configuration file for more information.


AUTHORS
       Written by Golden G. Richard III and Lodovico Marziale.  The first
       version of Scalpel was based on foremost 0.69, which was written by
       Special Agent Kris Kendall and Special Agent Jesse Kornblum of the
       United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations.


BUGS
       It is currently not possible to carve block devices directly using the
       Windows version of Scalpel.  This may be addressed in a future release.


REPORTING BUGS
