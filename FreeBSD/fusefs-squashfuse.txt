NAME
     squashfuse – mount a SquashFS archive with FUSE

SYNOPSIS
     squashfuse [-o options] archive mountpoint

DESCRIPTION
     squashfuse mounts the SquashFS filesystem archive on the directory
     mountpoint.  The filesystem can be unmounted using umount(8) or
     fusermount(8).  The squashfuse implementation is single-threaded.

     Options supported by the fuse(8) library are supported.  In addition the
     following options are supported:

     -o offset=N
              offset N bytes into archive to mount

     -o subdir=PATH
              mount subdirectory PATH as filesystem root

     -o notify_pipe=PATH
              named pipe that will receive 's' (success) or 'f' (failure) when
              the mountpoint is ready

     Here is a selection of generally useful FUSE library options:

     -h, --help
              print help

     -V, --version
              show FUSE version

     -d, -o debug
              enable debug output (implies -f)

     -f       foreground operation

     -o allow_other
              allow access by other users

     -o allow_root
              allow access by the superuser
