PAM_TACPLUS(8)          FreeBSD System Manager's Manual         PAM_TACPLUS(8)

NAME
     pam_tacplus – TACACS+ authentication PAM module

SYNOPSIS
     [service-name] module-type control-flag pam_tacplus [options]

DESCRIPTION
     The pam_tacplus module provides authentication services based upon the
     TACACS+ protocol for the PAM (Pluggable Authentication Module) framework.

     The pam_tacplus module accepts these optional parameters:

     use_first_pass      causes pam_tacplus to use a previously entered
                         password instead of prompting for a new one.  If no
                         password has been entered then authentication fails.

     try_first_pass      causes pam_tacplus to use a previously entered
                         password, if one is available.  If no password has
                         been entered, pam_tacplus prompts for one as usual.

     echo_pass           causes echoing to be left on if pam_tacplus prompts
                         for a password.

     conf=pathname       specifies a non-standard location for the TACACS+
                         client configuration file (normally located in
                         /etc/tacplus.conf).

     template_user=username
                         specifies a user whose passwd(5) entry will be used
                         as a template to create the session environment if
                         the supplied username does not exist in local
                         password database.  The user will be authenticated
                         with the supplied username and password, but his
                         credentials to the system will be presented as the
                         ones for username, i.e., his login class, home
                         directory, resource limits, etc. will be set to ones
                         defined for username.

                         If this option is omitted, and there is no username
                         in the system databases equal to the supplied one (as
                         determined by call to getpwnam(3)), the
                         authentication will fail.
