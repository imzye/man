NAME
       uuid-config - OSSP uuid API build utility

VERSION
       OSSP uuid 1.6.2 (04-Jul-2008)

SYNOPSIS
       uuid-config [--help] [--version] [--all] [--prefix] [--exec-prefix]
       [--bindir] [--libdir] [--includedir] [--mandir] [--datadir] [--acdir]
       [--cflags] [--ldflags] [--libs]

DESCRIPTION
       The uuid-config program is a little helper utility for easy configuring
       and building applications based on the uuid(3) library.  It can be used
       to query the C compiler and linker flags which are required to
       correctly compile and link the application against the uuid(3) library.

OPTIONS
       uuid-config accepts the following options:

       --help
         Prints the short usage information.

       --version
         Prints the version number and date of the installed uuid(3) library.

       --all
         Forces the output of all flags, that is, including extra flags which
         are not OSSP uuid specific.

       --prefix
         Prints the installation prefix of architecture independent files

       --exec-prefix
         Prints the installation prefix of architecture dependent files.

       --bindir
         Prints the installation directory of binaries.

       --libdir
         Prints the installation directory of libraries.

       --includedir
         Prints the installation directory of include headers.

       --mandir
         Prints the installation directory of manual pages.

       --datadir
         Prints the installation directory of shared data.

       --acdir
         Prints the installation directory of autoconf data.

       --cflags
         Prints the C compiler flags which are needed to compile the
         uuid(3)-based application. The output is usually added to the CFLAGS
         uuidiable of the applications Makefile.

       --ldflags
         Prints the linker flags (-L) which are needed to link the application
         with the uuid(3) library. The output is usually added to the LDFLAGS
         uuidiable of the applications Makefile.

       --libs
         Prints the library flags (-l) which are needed to link the
         application with the C uuid(3) library. The output is usually added
         to the LIBS uuidiable of the applications Makefile.

EXAMPLE
        CC      = cc
        CFLAGS  = -O `uuid-config --cflags`
        LDFLAGS = `uuid-config --ldflags`
        LIBS    = -lm `uuid-config --libs`

        all: foo
        foo: foo.o
            $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) -o foo foo.o $(LIBS)
        foo.o: foo.c
            $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c foo.c
