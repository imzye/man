NAME
       Math::SymbolicX::Error - Parser extension for dealing with numeric
       errors

SYNOPSIS
         use Math::Symbolic qw/parse_from_string/;
         use Math::SymbolicX::Error;

         # Inlined Number::WithError declarations:
         my $formula = parse_from_string('3 * error(3 +/- 0.2)^2 + error(1 +/- 0.1)');
         print $formula->value();
         # prints '2.80e+01 +/- 3.6e+00'

         # High precision support using Math::BigFloat
         my $high_precision = parse_from_string('3 * error_big(3e-12 +/- 0.2e-12');
         print $high_precision->value();
         # prints '9.00e-12 +/- 6.0e-13'

DESCRIPTION
       This module adds numeric error (or uncertainty) support to the
       Math::Symbolic parser. It does so by extending the parser grammar of
       the Math::Symbolic module (that is, the one stored in
       $Math::Symbolic::Parser) with certain special functions that create
       constants as Number::WithError objects.  (Math::Symbolic::Variable
       objects have been able to contain objects since the very beginning.)

   MOTIVATION
       All constants in strings that are parsed by Math::Symbolic::Parser are
       converted to Math::Symbolic::Constant objects holding the value
       associated to the constant in an ordinary Perl Scalar by default.
       Unfortunately, that means you are limited to real floating point
       numbers.

       On the other hand, it might be necessary to attach a certain error to a
       number and calculate using error propagation. Math::SymbolicX::Error
       helps making this process more opaque. Since the
       Math::Symbolic::Constant objects can hold any object, you can build
       your trees by hand using Math::Complex objects instead of Perl Scalars
       for the value of the constants.  But since the Math::Symbolic::Parser
       is by far the most convenient interface to Math::Symbolic, there had to
       be a reasonably simple way of introducing Number::WithError support to
       the parser. So here goes.

   USAGE
       In order to numeric constants with errors in Math::Symbolic trees from
       the parser, you just load this extension module and wrap any of the
       functions listed hereafter around any constants that have an associated
       error.

       The aforementioned functions are error() and error_big().  error()
       turns its arguments into a Number::WithError object which is injected
       into the Math::Symbolic tree at the point in the parse tree at which
       the error() function was found.

       Similarily, error_big() creates a Number::WithError object but with
       Math::BigFloat support. That is, arbitrary precision.

       You should definately be familiar with Number::WithError before you
       start using this module because the objects that are returned from
       "$formula-"value()> calls are Number::WithError objects.
