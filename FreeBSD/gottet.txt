NAME
       gottet - simple falling blocks game


SYNOPSIS
       gottet [options]


DESCRIPTION
       Gottet is a clone of Tetris I wrote for my wife. Pieces fall from the
       top of the play area and you can move them horizontally as well as
       rotate them before they reach the bottom of the play area. The goal is
       to create full lines of pieces, which are then removed. The game is
       over when the stack of pieces reaches the top of the play area.
