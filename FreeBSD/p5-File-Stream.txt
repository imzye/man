NAME
       File::Stream - Regular expression delimited records from streams

SYNOPSIS
         use File::Stream;
         my $stream = File::Stream->new($filehandle);

         $/ = qr/\s*,\s*/;
         print "$_\n" while <$stream>;

         # or:
         ($handler, $stream) = File::Stream->new(
           $filehandle,
           read_length => 1024,
           separator => qr{to_be_used_instead_of_$/},
         );

         while(<$stream>) {...}
         my $line = $stream->readline(); # similar

         # extended usage:
         use URI;
         my $uri = URI->new('http://steffen-mueller.net');
         my ($pre_match, $match) =
           $handler->find('literal_string', qr/regex/, $uri);

         # $match contains whichever argument to find() was found first.
         # $pre_match contains all that was before the first token that was found.
         # both the contents of $match and $pre_match have been removed from the
         # data stream (buffer).

         # Since version 2.10 of the module, you can use seek() and tell() on
         # File::Stream objects:
         my $position = tell($stream);
         # ...
         seek($stream, 0, $position); # rewind

DESCRIPTION
       Perl filehandles are streams, but sometimes they just aren't powerful
       enough.  This module offers to have streams from filehandles searched
       with regexes and allows the global input record separator variable to
       contain regexes.

       Thus, readline() and the <> operator can now return records delimited
       by regular expression matches.

       There are some very important gripes with applying regular expressions
       to (possibly infinite) streams. Please read the CAVEATS section of this
       documentation carfully.

   EXPORT
       None.

   new
       The new() constructor takes a filehandle (or a glob reference) as first
       argument. The following arguments are interpreted as key/value pairs
       with the following parameters being defined:

       separator
           This may be set to either a string, a compiled regular expression
           (qr//), or an object which is overloaded in stringification context
           to return a string.

           If separator is set, its value will be used in calls to readline()
           (including the <> diamond operator which calls readline internally)
           instead of $/, the global input record separator.

           String will be interpreted as literal strings, not regular
           expressions.

       read_length
           Defaults to 1024 bytes. Sets the number of bytes to read into the
           internal buffer at once. Large values may speed up searching
           considerably, but increase memory usage.

       die_on_anchors
           Defaults to true. If set, any call to find() will die on regular
           expressions which contain anchors ("^ and $"). Usually, those do
           not make much sense in regular expressions applied to streams.  If,
           however, you're using the "//m" option, these anchors match the
           start and end of each line respectively. In that case, you can
           suppress the fatal error by setting "die_on_anchors => 0".

       The new() method returns a fresh File::Stream object that has been tied
       to be a filehandle and a filehandle. All the usual file operations
       should work on the filehandle and the File::Stream methods should work
       on the object.

   readline
       The readline method on a File::Stream object works just like the
       builtin except that it uses the objects record separator instead of $/
       if it has been set via new() and honours regular expressions.

       This is also internally used when readline() is called on the tied
       filehandle.

   find
       Finds the first occurrance one of its arguments in the stream. For
       example,

         $stream_handler->find('a', 'b');

       finds the first character 'a' or 'b' in the stream whichever comes
       first.  Returns two strings: The data read from the stream before the
       match and the match itself. The arguments to find() may be regular
       expressions, but please see the CAVEATS section of this documentation
       about that.  If any of the arguments is an object, it will be evaluated
       in stringification context and the result of that will be matched
       literally, ie. not as a regular expression.

       As with readline(), this is a method on the stream handler object.

   fill_buffer
       It is unlikely that you will need to call this method directly.  Reads
       more data from the internal filehandle into the buffer.  First argument
       may be the number of bytes to read, otherwise the 'read_length'
       attribute is used.

       Again, call this on the handler object, not the file handle.

CAVEATS
       There are several important issues to keep in mind when using this
       module.  First, setting $/ to a regular expression will most certainly
       break badly when $/ is used on filehandles that are not File::Stream
       object.  Please consider setting the "separator" attribute of the
       File::Stream object instead for a more robust solution.

       In a later version of this module, either $/ may be tied to do magic
       that only applies the regex to File::Stream objects, or
       CORE::readline() might be overridden to use the builtin readline()
       whenever the handle at hand is not a File::Stream. It is currently
       unclear which would be less bad.

       Most importantly, however, there are some inherent problems with
       regular expressions applied to (possibly infinite) streams. The
       implementation of Perl's regular expression engine requires that the
       string you apply a regular expression to be in memory completely. That
       means applying a regular expression that matches infinitely long
       strings (like .*) to a stream will lead to the module reading in the
       whole file, or worse yet, an infinite string. Anchors like ^ or $ don't
       make sense with streams either, but since version 1.11 of File::Stream,
       the module throws a fatal error when finding an anchor in a regular
       expression.  Using infinitely long matches on infinite streams may
       still result in your machine running out of memory. So don't do that!

       Since version 1.10, the buffer is extended whenever the regex reaches
       its end.  That means it has to tokenize the regex and insert weird
       constructs in many places. This is a rather slow and fragile process.

       Many thanks to Simon Cozens for his advice and the original idea,
       Autrijus Tang for much help with the fiendish regexes I couldn't
       handle, and Ben Tilly for suggesting the use of the ${} regex
       construct.

       Furthermore, since version 2.10, File::Stream includes a patch
       implementing seek() and tell() for File::Stream objects. The idea and
       code were kindly supplied by Phil Whineray.
