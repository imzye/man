NAME
       sdig.conf - Configuration for the Switch Digger


DESCRIPTION
       sdig(8) uses this file to learn about your network's configuration.  It
       is essential to proper operation.


SECURITY WARNING
       This file will obviously contain a great deal of information about your
       organization's network, including SNMP community strings.  For that
       reason, you should use appropriate permissions so that only authorized
       users may access it.

       I recommend creating a new group, then make the file readable by that
       group, and place specific users into that group.

       This file should not be world-readable.


DIRECTIVES
       ROUTER network addr community description rtr_ip

              List a router for the network network (CIDR or a.b.c.d/x.x.x.x
              format) at IP address addr using SNMP community community.  The
              description provides some details when generating the output.
              Remember to wrap the description in "quotes" if it contains any
              sort of whitespace (spaces, tabs, etc).

                   ROUTER 192.168.3.0/24 192.168.3.1 mycommunity "Company core
              router"

              Optional rtr_ip can be used to provide an explicit IP address of
              the routing interface in the target network. Otherwise the same
              addr used for SNMP queries is used as the routing interface
              address, which may be wrong. For example, firewall rules may
              allow SNMP access to only one IP of the router, but ARP lookups
              usually require specific interfaces within the target's subnet.

              For example, to query the router (rtr_ip) 192.168.2.1 of the
              network 192.168.2.0/24 via SNMP interface (addr) 192.168.3.254
              configure a line like this:

                   ROUTER 192.168.2.0/24 192.168.3.254 mycommunity "Company
              core router" 192.168.2.1

              Textual Hostnames can be used for rtr_ip and addr, subject to be
              resolved by system (via /etc/hosts or DNS Resolver).

              NOTE: Some switches, namely Cisco Catalyst (IOS), require SNMP
              queries for different VLANs to use different community strings.
              For example, to look up mycommunity in VLAN123 you'll need to
              write mycommunity@123.


       SWITCH network addr community description

              Like ROUTER, but for a switch instead. Note there's no
              equivalent of rtr_ip.

                   SWITCH 192.168.3.0/24 192.168.3.2 mycommunity "Upstairs
              data room"

                   SWITCH 192.168.3.0/24 192.168.3.3 mycommunity "Downstairs
              data room"

              Textual Hostnames can be used for addr, resolved by system
              (/etc/hosts or DNS Resolver).

              NOTE: Some switches, namely Cisco Catalyst (IOS), require SNMP
              queries for different VLANs to use different community strings.
              For example, to look up mycommunity in VLAN123 you'll need to
              write mycommunity@123.


       LINKINFO addr port num description

              Describe a connection between switches so it won't show up on
              the normal sdig display.  This limits your findings in normal
              mode to port(s) that probably lead to the target host.  Use
              verbose mode to display all of them, even the ones that just go
              to other switches.

                   LINKINFO 192.168.3.2 24 "link to downstairs switch"

                   LINKINFO 192.168.3.3 24 "link to upstairs switch"


       PORTDESC addr port num description

              Describe a port in a switch.  Usually used for details like
              patch panel numbers and other things that can't be inferred by
              asking the equipment directly.

              Also useful for downlink ports to either "dumb" active equipment
              (i.e.  hubs with no SNMP capabilities) or to another network's
              equipment to which you have no SNMP-query access (unknown
              community name).

                   PORTDESC 192.168.3.2 1 "Upstairs patch panel #10"

                   PORTDESC 192.168.3.3 25 "Fiber to remote site"

                   PORTDESC 192.168.3.3 48 "UPLINK to Campus ISP"


       WINS addr

              Tell nmblookup to use the WINS server at addr for name lookups.
              Only used when NMBLOOKUP is defined and DNS lookups fail.

                   WINS 192.168.100.1


       NMBLOOKUP path

              Specify the path to Samba's nmblookup binary.  This might be
              /usr/local/samba/bin/nmblookup if you do a stock install from
              source.  This program is optional, and is provided to augment
              DNS lookups in environments laden with Windows machines.

                   NMBLOOKUP /usr/local/bin/nmblookup


       MACTABLE path

              Specify the location of the MAC table file.  This is another
              item that is used to provide a few more bits of information when
              tracking down a system.  You might use it to find rogue NICs
              that are not the company-approved brand.

              This file is rather large and rarely changes, so it's not
              included in the source distribution.  You can get it on the main
              sdig web site - http://www.exploits.org/sdig/

                   MACTABLE /usr/local/etc/mactable


       HOSTINFO path

              Give the location of a script or program that will be called
              shortly after displaying the Query: data.  It will receive the
              IP address of the target host as an argument.

              If you want to display things like the system's NetBIOS name,
              this is a good place to put a call to Samba's nmblookup.
