SYSMOUSE(4)            FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual            SYSMOUSE(4)

NAME
     sysmouse – virtualized mouse driver

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/mouse.h>
     #include <sys/consio.h>

DESCRIPTION
     The console driver, in conjunction with the mouse daemon moused(8),
     supplies mouse data to the user process in the standardized way via the
     sysmouse driver.  This arrangement makes it possible for the console and
     the user process (such as the X Window System) to share the mouse.

     The user process which wants to utilize mouse operation simply opens
     /dev/sysmouse with a open(2) call and reads mouse data from the device
     via read(2).  Make sure that moused(8) is running, otherwise the user
     process will not see any data coming from the mouse.

   Operation Levels
     The sysmouse driver has two levels of operation.  The current operation
     level can be referred to and changed via ioctl calls.

     The level zero, the basic level, is the lowest level at which the driver
     offers the basic service to user programs.  The sysmouse driver provides
     horizontal and vertical movement of the mouse and state of up to three
     buttons in the MouseSystems format as follows.

     Byte 1
             bit 7  Always one.
             bit 6..3
                    Always zero.
             bit 2  Left button status; cleared if pressed, otherwise set.
             bit 1  Middle button status; cleared if pressed, otherwise set.
                    Always one, if the device does not have the middle button.
             bit 0  Right button status; cleared if pressed, otherwise set.
     Byte 2  The first half of horizontal movement count in two's complement;
             -128 through 127.
     Byte 3  The first half of vertical movement count in two's complement;
             -128 through 127.
     Byte 4  The second half of the horizontal movement count in two's
             complement; -128 through 127.  To obtain the full horizontal
             movement count, add the byte 2 and 4.
     Byte 5  The second half of the vertical movement count in two's
             complement; -128 through 127.  To obtain the full vertical
             movement count, add the byte 3 and 5.

     At the level one, the extended level, mouse data is encoded in the
     standard format MOUSE_PROTO_SYSMOUSE as defined in mouse(4).

IOCTLS
     This section describes two classes of ioctl(2) commands: commands for the
     sysmouse driver itself, and commands for the console and the console
     control drivers.

   Sysmouse Ioctls
     There are a few commands for mouse drivers.  General description of the
     commands is given in mouse(4).  Following are the features specific to
     the sysmouse driver.

     MOUSE_GETLEVEL int *level
     MOUSE_SETLEVEL int *level
            These commands manipulate the operation level of the mouse driver.

     MOUSE_GETHWINFO mousehw_t *hw
            Returns the hardware information of the attached device in the
            following structure.  Only the iftype field is guaranteed to be
            filled with the correct value in the current version of the
            sysmouse driver.

            typedef struct mousehw {
                int buttons;    /* number of buttons */
                int iftype;     /* I/F type */
                int type;       /* mouse/track ball/pad... */
                int model;      /* I/F dependent model ID */
                int hwid;       /* I/F dependent hardware ID */
            } mousehw_t;

            The buttons field holds the number of buttons detected by the
            driver.

            The iftype is always MOUSE_IF_SYSMOUSE.

            The type tells the device type: MOUSE_MOUSE, MOUSE_TRACKBALL,
            MOUSE_STICK, MOUSE_PAD, or MOUSE_UNKNOWN.

            The model is always MOUSE_MODEL_GENERIC at the operation level 0.
            It may be MOUSE_MODEL_GENERIC or one of MOUSE_MODEL_XXX constants
            at higher operation levels.

            The hwid is always zero.

     MOUSE_GETMODE mousemode_t *mode
            The command gets the current operation parameters of the mouse
            driver.

            typedef struct mousemode {
                int protocol;    /* MOUSE_PROTO_XXX */
                int rate;        /* report rate (per sec) */
                int resolution;  /* MOUSE_RES_XXX, -1 if unknown */
                int accelfactor; /* acceleration factor */
                int level;       /* driver operation level */
                int packetsize;  /* the length of the data packet */
                unsigned char syncmask[2]; /* sync. bits */
            } mousemode_t;

            The protocol field tells the format in which the device status is
            returned when the mouse data is read by the user program.  It is
            MOUSE_PROTO_MSC at the operation level zero.  MOUSE_PROTO_SYSMOUSE
            at the operation level one.

            The rate is always set to -1.

            The resolution is always set to -1.

            The accelfactor is always 0.

            The packetsize field specifies the length of the data packet.  It
            depends on the operation level.

            level 0    5 bytes
            level 1    8 bytes

            The array syncmask holds a bit mask and pattern to detect the
            first byte of the data packet.  syncmask[0] is the bit mask to be
            ANDed with a byte.  If the result is equal to syncmask[1], the
            byte is likely to be the first byte of the data packet.  Note that
            this method of detecting the first byte is not 100% reliable;
            thus, it should be taken only as an advisory measure.

     MOUSE_SETMODE mousemode_t *mode
            The command changes the current operation parameters of the mouse
            driver as specified in mode.  Only level may be modifiable.
            Setting values in the other field does not generate error and has
            no effect.

     MOUSE_READDATA mousedata_t *data
     MOUSE_READSTATE mousedata_t *state
            These commands are not supported by the sysmouse driver.

     MOUSE_GETSTATUS mousestatus_t *status
            The command returns the current state of buttons and movement
            counts in the structure as defined in mouse(4).

   Console and Consolectl Ioctls
     The user process issues console ioctl() calls to the current virtual
     console in order to control the mouse pointer.  The console ioctl() also
     provides a method for the user process to receive a signal(3) when a
     button is pressed.

     The mouse daemon moused(8) uses ioctl() calls to the console control
     device /dev/consolectl to inform the console of mouse actions including
     mouse movement and button status.

     Both classes of ioctl() commands are defined as CONS_MOUSECTL which takes
     the following argument.

     struct mouse_info {
         int operation;
         union {
             struct mouse_data data;
             struct mouse_mode mode;
             struct mouse_event event;
         } u;
     };

     operation  This can be one of

                MOUSE_SHOW     Enables and displays mouse cursor.
                MOUSE_HIDE     Disables and hides mouse cursor.
                MOUSE_MOVEABS  Moves mouse cursor to position supplied in
                               u.data.
                MOUSE_MOVEREL  Adds position supplied in u.data to current
                               position.
                MOUSE_GETINFO  Returns current mouse position in the current
                               virtual console and button status in u.data.
                MOUSE_MODE     This sets the signal(3) to be delivered to the
                               current process when a button is pressed.  The
                               signal to be delivered is set in u.mode.

                The above operations are for virtual consoles.  The operations
                defined below are for the console control device and are used
                by moused(8) to pass mouse data to the console driver.

                MOUSE_ACTION
                MOUSE_MOTION_EVENT
                               These operations take the information in u.data
                               and act upon it.  Mouse data will be sent to
                               the sysmouse driver if it is open.
                               MOUSE_ACTION also processes button press
                               actions and sends signal to the process if
                               requested or performs cut and paste operations
                               if the current console is a text interface.
                MOUSE_BUTTON_EVENT
                               u.data specifies a button and its click count.
                               The console driver will use this information
                               for signal delivery if requested or for cut and
                               paste operations if the console is in text
                               mode.

                MOUSE_MOTION_EVENT and MOUSE_BUTTON_EVENT are newer interface
                and are designed to be used together.  They are intended to
                replace functions performed by MOUSE_ACTION alone.

     u          This union is one of

                data

                      struct mouse_data {
                          int x;
                          int y;
                          int z;
                          int buttons;
                      };

                      x, y and z represent movement of the mouse along
                      respective directions.  buttons tells the state of
                      buttons.  It encodes up to 31 buttons in the bit 0
                      though the bit 30.  If a button is held down, the
                      corresponding bit is set.

                mode

                      struct mouse_mode {
                          int mode;
                          int signal;
                      };

                      The signal field specifies the signal to be delivered to
                      the process.  It must be one of the values defined in
                      <signal.h>.  The mode field is currently unused.

                event

                      struct mouse_event {
                          int id;
                          int value;
                      };

                      The id field specifies a button number as in
                      u.data.buttons.  Only one bit/button is set.  The value
                      field holds the click count: the number of times the
                      user has clicked the button successively.
