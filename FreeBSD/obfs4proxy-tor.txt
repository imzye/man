OBFS4PROXY(1)           FreeBSD General Commands Manual          OBFS4PROXY(1)

NAME
       obfs4proxy - pluggable transport proxy for Tor, implementing obfs4

SYNOPSIS
       obfs4proxy [options]

DESCRIPTION
       obfs4proxy is a tool that attempts to circumvent censorship by
       transforming the Tor traffic between the client and the bridge. This
       way censors, who usually monitor traffic between the client and the
       bridge, will see innocent-looking transformed traffic instead of the
       actual Tor traffic.

       obfs4proxy implements the obfuscation protocols obfs2, obfs3,
       ScrambleSuit (client only), meek (client only) and obfs4.

       obfs4proxy is currently only supported as a managed pluggable transport
       spawned as a helper process via the tor daemon.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Display usage information and exit.

       --version
              Display version information and exit.

       --enableLogging
              Enable logging.

       --logLevel=level
              Specify the maximum log severity to log out of "ERROR", "WARN",
              "INFO", and "DEBUG".

       --unsafeLogging
              Disable the IP address scrubber when logging, storing personally
              identifiable information in the logs.

       --obfs4-distBias
              When generating probability distributions for the obfs4 length
              and timing obfuscation, generate biased distributions similar to
              ScrambleSuit.

ENVIORNMENT
       obfs4proxy honors all of the enviornment variables as specified in the
       Tor Pluggable Transport Specification.

FILES
       DataDirectory/pt_state/obfs4proxy.log
           The log file, assuming logging is enabled.

       DataDirectory/pt_state/obfs4_state.json
           The Bridge (server) auto-generated obfs4 bridge parameters file.
           This file will not be created if the administrator specifies them
           in the torrc via a ServerTransportOptions directive.

       DataDirectory/pt_state/obfs4_bridgeline.txt
           The Bridge (server) obfs4 bridge's client parameters.  This file is
           created and contains the Bridge directive a client should add to
           their torrc to connect to the running server's obfs4 instance.

CONFORMING TO
       Tor Pluggable Transport Specification

NOTES
       Using the obfs4 protocol requires tor-0.2.5.x or later.

       The obfs2 protocol is included for backwards compatibility purposes
       only, and should not be used in new deployments.

EXAMPLE
       To configure tor to be able to use obfs4 bridges (as a client), add
       obfs4proxy to the torrc like thus:

              # Use obfs4proxy to provide the obfs4 protocol.
              ClientTransportPlugin obfs4 exec /usr/bin/obfs4proxy

       To configure tor to act as an obfs4 bridge (as the server), add
       obfs4proxy to the torrc like thus:

              #
              # In addition to the standard tor bridge configuration, add:
              #

              # Use obfs4proxy to provide the obfs4 protocol.
              ServerTransportPlugin obfs4 exec /usr/bin/obfs4proxy
