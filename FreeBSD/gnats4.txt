              PR

DESCRIPTION
       edit-pr is used to make changes to existing PRs in a GNATS database.

       edit-pr first examines the PR and locks it if it is not already locked.
       This is to prevent a PR from being edited by two users simultaneously.
       If the PR is already in the process of being edited, edit-pr displays
       the name of the person who owns the lock.

       edit-pr then calls $EDITOR on PR.  After the PR has been edited, it is
       resubmitted to the database, and the index is updated.

       If you change a field that requires a reason for the change, edit-pr
       prompts you to supply a reason for the change.  A message is then
       appended to the Audit-Trail field of PR with the changed values and the
       change reason.

       Depending on how the database is configured, editing various fields in
       the PR may also cause mail to be sent concerning these changes.  In the
       default configuration, any fields that generate Audit-Trail entries
       will cause a copy of the new Audit-Trail message to be sent.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
                 Prints a brief usage message for edit-pr.

       -V, --version
                 Prints the version number for edit-pr.

       -d, --database
                 Specifies the database containing the PR to be edited; if no
                 database is specified, the database named default is assumed.
                 This option overrides the database specified in the GNATSDB
                 environment variable.

   GNATS network options:
       -H, --host
              Hostname of the GNATS server.

       -P, --port
              The port that the GNATS server runs on.

       -v, --username
              Username used to log into the GNATS server.

       -w, --passwd
              Password used to log into the GNATS server.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The environment variable EDITOR specifies the editor to invoke on the
       PR.  Default is vi(1).

       The GNATSDB environment variable is used to determine which database to
              use.  For a local database, it contains the name of the database
              to access.

       For network access via gnatsd, it contains a colon-separated list of
       strings that describe the remote database, in the form

       server:port:databasename:username:password

       Any of the fields may be omitted, but at least one colon must appear;
       otherwise, the value is assumed to be the name of a local database.

       If GNATSDB is not set, it is assumed that the database is local and
       that its name is default.

FILES
       /tmp/ep$$ Temporary file for PR being edited.

       /tmp/ed_pr_ch$$
                 Holds Audit-Trail change message, if needed.
