NAME
       PerlIO::locale - PerlIO layer to use the encoding of the current locale

VERSION
       0.07

SYNOPSIS
           use PerlIO::locale;
           open my $filehandle, '<:locale', $filename or die $!;

DESCRIPTION
       This is mostly a per-filehandle version of the "open" pragma, when used
       under the form

           use open ':locale';

       The encoding for the opened file will be set to the encoding
       corresponding to the locale currently in effect, if perl can guess it.
