TUC(1)                  FreeBSD General Commands Manual                 TUC(1)

NAME
     tuc – Text to Unix Conversion (v1.10)

SYNOPSIS
     tuc [-d|D] [-i inputfile] [-o outputfile]
     tuc [-d|D] [inputfile [outputfile]]

DESCRIPTION
     The tuc utility converts text files from DOS, or any operating system to
     UNIX style text files. As of version 1.10, it optionally converts files
     to DOS style text files.

     Tuc does more than simply strip (or insert) carriage returns. It uses a
     state machine to check for the following line endings:

           cr/lf
           cr/lf/lf... (for multiple lines)
           cr
           lf/cr
           lf

     Because of that, tuc can convert files created under any operating system
     to UNIX text files.

     The tuc utility exits 0 on success, 1 when the command line is invalid,
     or 2 when it cannot open a file.

USAGE
   Converting to UNIX
     To convert a file to UNIX text file simply enter:

           tuc inputfile outputfile

     Inputfile is a text file created in any operating system. It can use any
     combination of carriage returns and line feeds as line terminators.

     If no outputfile is specified, the output is sent to stdout.  Similarly,
     if no inputfile is listed, tuc reads its input from stdin.

     If you wish to read input from stdin but send output to a file, use the
     -o flag followed by outputfile. For example,

           tuc -o outputfile

     You may also use the -i flag to specify inputfile explicitly. If you use
     both -i and -o switches, you may list the files in any order.

   Converting to DOS
     Starting with version 1.10, tuc can also convert UNIX files, or files
     created under any operating system, to DOS style text files. This
     requires the -d or -D switch, with a subtle difference between the two.
     Which switch you should use depends on the operating system.

     -D will always produce DOS style output.

     -d produces DOS style output if outputfile is specified. However, if
     output is sent to stdout, tuc will produce UNIX style output. This is
     because tuc can be compiled as both a UNIX program and a DOS program. DOS
     opens the console in the cooked mode. That means, DOS appends carriage
     returns after all line feeds sent to the console.

     You only need -D under UNIX. Under DOS, choose between -d and -D,
     depending on where you want to send the output.

   Examples
     Save the output of a UNIX program to a DOS text file:

           unixprogram | tuc -D -o dostextfile

     Save the output of a DOS program to a UNIX text file:

           dosprogram | tuc -o unixtexfile

     Filter the output of a DOS program as input to a UNIX program:

           dosprogram | tuc | unixprogram

     Filter the output of a UNIX program as input to a DOS program:

           unixprogram | tuc -D | dosprogram
