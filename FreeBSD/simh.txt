SIMH(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual (con)             SIMH(1)

NAME
     simh – Simulation suite for various computer systems

SYNOPSIS
     simh [-e] [-q] [-v] [startup-file [arguments]]

DESCRIPTION
     simh is a comprehensive suite of simulators for a number of legacy
     computer systems.

     Note that there is no actual simh command; each simulator is invoked with
     its own command.  Currently, the available commands are:

           altair, altairz80, gri, h316, hp2100, i1401, i1620, i7094, ibm1130,
           id16, id32, lgp, nova, pdp1, pdp10, pdp11, pdp15, pdp4, pdp7, pdp8,
           pdp9, s3, sds, simh-eclipse, swtp6800mp-a, swtp6800mp-a2, vax,
           vax780.

     The following options are available for all of the commands:

     -e      Processing of startup-file (including nested command invocations)
             is aborted if a command error is encountered.

     -q      Certain informational messages are suppressed.

     -v      The commands in startup-file are echoed before they are executed.

     If startup-file is specified, it is used as an initial source of
     simulator commands.  If startup-file is not specified, the simulator
     looks for a startup file consisting of the simulator name (including its
     path components) plus the extension .ini.

     If a startup file is specified, either on the command line or implicitly
     via the .ini capability, it should contain a series of non-interactive
     simulator commands, one per line.  These commands can be used to set up
     standard parameters, for example disk sizes.

     After initializing its internal structures and processing the startup
     file (if any), the simulator types out its name and version and then
     prompts for input with:

           sim>

EXIT STATUS
     simh exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

SEE ALSO
     Documentation is available for each of the simulators. There is also
     generic simulator documentation. It can be found locally in
     /usr/local/share/doc/simh (if installed), and also at
     http://simh.trailing-edge.com/pdf/all_docs.html.
