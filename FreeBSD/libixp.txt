IXPC(1)                 FreeBSD General Commands Manual                IXPC(1)

NAME
       ixpc - ixp client

SYNOPSIS
       ixpc [-a address] action file
       ixpc -v

DESCRIPTION
   Overview
       ixpc is a client to access a 9P file server from the command line or
       from shell scripts. It can be used to configure wmii(1).

   Options
       -a address
              Lets you specify the address to which ixpc will establish a
              connection. If this option is not supplied, and the environment
              variable IXP_ADDRESS is set, ixpc will use this value as its
              address. Currently, the address can only be a unix socket file
              or a tcp socket. The syntax for address is taken (along with
              many other profound ideas) from the Plan 9 operating system and
              has the form unix!/path/to/socket for unix socket files, and
              tcp!hostname!port for tcp sockets.

       -v     Prints version information to stdout, then exits.

       The syntax of the actions is as follows:

       write  Writes the supplied data from the standard input to file,
              overwriting any previous data.  The data to be written is
              arbitrary and only gains meaning (and restrictions) when it is
              interpreted by wmiiwm(1).  See EXAMPLES below.

       xwrite The same as write, but the data is taken from subsequent
              arguments, rather than the standard input.

       create Creates file or directory. If the file exists, nothing is done.

       ls     Lists files and directories.

       read   Reads file or directory contents.

       remove Removes file or directory tree.

ENVIRONMENT
       IXP_ADDRESS
              See above.

EXAMPLES
       ixpc ls /
              This prints the root directory of the wmii filesystem, if
              IXP_ADDRESS is set to the address of wmii. For more information
              about the contents of this filesystem, see wmiiwm(1).

       ixpc xwrite /ctl quit
              Write 'quit' to the main control file of the wmii filesystem,
              effectively leaving wmii.

       ixpc write /keys < keys.txt
              Replace the contents of /keys with the contents of keys.txt
