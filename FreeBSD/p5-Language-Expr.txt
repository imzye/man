Language::Expr(3)     User Contributed Perl Documentation    Language::Expr(3)


NAME
       Language::Expr - Simple minilanguage for use in expression

VERSION
       This document describes version 0.29 of Language::Expr (from Perl
       distribution Language-Expr), released on 2016-07-03.

SYNOPSIS
        use Language::Expr;

        my $le = Language::Expr->new;

        # convert Expr to string Perl code
        say $le->get_compiler('perl')->compile('1 ^^ 2'); => # "(1 xor 2)"

        # convert Expr to JavaScript
        say $le->get_compiler('js')->compile('1 . 2'); # => "'' + 1 + 2"

        # evaluate Expr using the default interpreter
        say $le->get_interpreter('default')->eval('1 + 2'); # => 3

        # enumerate variables
        my $vars = $le->enum_vars('$a*$a + sqr($b)'); # => ['a', 'b']

DESCRIPTION
       Language::Expr defines a simple, Perl-like expression minilanguage. It
       supports mathematical and string operators, arrays, hashes, variables,
       and functions. See Language::Expr::Manual::Syntax for description of
       the language syntax.

       This distribution consists of the language parser
       (Language::Expr::Parser), some interpreters
       (Language::Expr::Interpreter::*), and some compilers
       (Language::Expr::Compiler::*).

KNOWN BUGS
       Due to possible bugs in Perl's RE engine or Regexp::Grammars or my
       grammar, some syntax errors will cause further parsing to fail.

ATTRIBUTES
METHODS
   new()
   get_compiler($name) => obj
       Get compiler named $name, e.g. "perl", "js".

   get_interpreter($name) => obj
       Get compiler named $name, e.g. "default", "var_enumer", "dummy".

FAQ
   Why yet another simplistic (restricted, etc) language? Why not just Perl?
       When first adding expression support to Data::Schema (now Data::Sah), I
       want a language that is simple enough so I can easily convert it to
       Perl, PHP, JavaScript, and others. I do not need a fully-fledged
       programming language. In fact, Expr is not even Turing-complete, it
       does not support assignment or loops.  Nor does it allow function
       definition (though it allows anonymous function in grep/map/usort).
       Instead, I just need some basic stuffs like mathematical/string/logical
       operators, arrays, hashes, functions, map/grep/usort. This language
       will mostly be used inside templates and schemas.

   Why don't you use Language::Farnsworth, or Math::Expression, or
       Math::Expression::Evaluator, or $FOO?
       I need several compilers and interpreters (some even with different
       semantics), so it's easier to start with a simple parser of my own. And
       of course there is personal preference of language syntax.

   What is the difference between a compiler and interpreter?
       An interpreter evaluates expression as it is being parsed, while a
       compiler generates a complete Perl (or whatever) code first. Thus, if
       you $le->eval() repeatedly using the interpreter mode (setting
       $le->interpreted(1)), you will repeatedly parse the expression each
       time. This can be one or more orders of magnitude slower compared to
       compiling into Perl once and then directly executing the Perl code
       repeatedly.

       Note that if you use $le->eval() using the default compiler mode, you
       do not reap the benefits of compilation because the expression will be
       compiled each time you call $le->eval(). To save the compilation
       result, use $le->compile() or $le->perl() and compile the Perl code
       yourself using Perl's eval().

   I want different syntax for (variables, foo operator, etc)!
       Create your own language :-) Fork this distribution and start modifying
       the Language::Expr::Parser module.

   How to show details of errors in expression?
       This is a TODO item.
