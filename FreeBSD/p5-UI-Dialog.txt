NAME
       UI::Dialog - wrapper for various dialog applications.

SYNOPSIS
         use UI::Dialog;
         my $d = new UI::Dialog ( backtitle => 'Demo', title => 'Default',
                                  height => 20, width => 65 , listheight => 5,
                                  order => [ 'zenity', 'xdialog' ] );

         # Either a Zenity or Xdialog msgbox widget should popup,
         # with a preference for Zenity.
         $d->msgbox( title => 'Welcome!', text => 'Welcome one and all!' );

ABSTRACT
       UI::Dialog is a OOPerl wrapper for the various dialog applications.
       These dialog backends are currently supported: Zenity, XDialog,
       GDialog, KDialog, CDialog, and Whiptail. There is also an ASCII backend
       provided as a last resort interface for the console based dialog
       variants. UI::Dialog is a class that provides a strict interface to
       these various backend modules.  By using UI:Dialog (with it's imposed
       limitations on the widgets) you can ensure that your Perl program will
       function with any available interfaces.

DESCRIPTION
       UI::Dialog supports priority ordering of the backend detection process.
       So if you'd prefer that Xdialog should be used first if available,
       simply designate the desired order when creating the new object. The
       default order for detecting and utilization of the backends are as
       follows:
         (with DISPLAY env): Zenity, GDialog, XDialog, KDialog
         (without DISPLAY): CDialog, Whiptail, ASCII

       UI::Dialog is the result of a complete re-write of the UDPM CPAN
       module. This was done to break away from the bad choice of name
       (UserDialogPerlModule) and to implement a cleaner, more detached,
       OOPerl interface.

CONSTRUCTOR
   new( @options )
       EXAMPLE
            my $d = new( title => 'Default Title', backtitle => 'Backtitle',
                         width => 65, height => 20, listheight => 5,
                         order => [ 'zenity', 'xdialog', 'gdialog' ] );

       DESCRIPTION
                 This is the Class Constructor method. It accepts a list of
                 key => value pairs and uses them as the defaults when
                 interacting with the various widgets.

       RETURNS
                 A blessed object reference of the UI::Dialog class.

       OPTIONS
           The (...)'s after each option indicate the default for the option.
           An * denotes support by all the widget methods on a per-use policy
           defaulting to the values decided during object creation.

           debug = 0,1,2 (0)
           order = [ zenity, xdialog, gdialog, kdialog, cdialog, whiptail,
           ascii ] (as indicated)
           PATH = [ /bin, /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin, /opt/bin ] (as indicated)
           backtitle = "backtitle" ('') *
           title = "title" ('') *
           beepbefore = 0,1 (0) *
           beepafter = 0,1 (0) *
           height = \d+ (20) *
           width = \d+ (65) *
           listheight = \d+ (5) *

                # user pressed yes
            } else {
                # user pressed no or cancel
            }

       DESCRIPTION
                 Present the end user with a message box that has two buttons,
                 yes and no.

       RETURNS

       EXAMPLE
            my $string = $d->inputbox( text => 'Please enter some text...',
                                       entry => 'this is the input field' );

       DESCRIPTION
                 Present the end user with a text input field and a message.

                 input, and a message.

                 Note that the GDialog backend will provide a regular inputbox
                 instead of a password box because gdialog doesn't support
                 passwords. GDialog is on it's way to the proverbial software
                 heaven so this isn't a real problem. Use Zenity instead :)
