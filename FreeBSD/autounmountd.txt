AUTOUNMOUNTD(8)         FreeBSD System Manager's Manual        AUTOUNMOUNTD(8)

NAME
     autounmountd – daemon unmounting automounted filesystems

SYNOPSIS
     autounmountd [-d] [-r time] [-t time] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
     The autounmountd daemon is responsible for unmounting filesystems mounted
     by automountd(8).  On startup, autounmountd retrieves a list of
     filesystems that have the automounted mount option set.  The list is
     updated every time a filesystem is mounted or unmounted.  After a
     specified time passes, autounmountd attempts to unmount a filesystem,
     retrying after some time if necessary.

     These options are available:

     -d     Debug mode: increase verbosity and do not daemonize.

     -r     Number of seconds to wait before trying to unmount an expired
            filesystem after a previous attempt failed, possibly due to
            filesystem being busy.  The default value is 600, or ten minutes.

     -t     Number of seconds to wait before trying to unmount a filesystem.
            The default value is 600, or ten minutes.

     -v     Increase verbosity.

EXIT STATUS
     The autounmountd utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
