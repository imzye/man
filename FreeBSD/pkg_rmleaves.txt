PKG_RMLEAVES(1)         FreeBSD General Commands Manual        PKG_RMLEAVES(1)

NAME
       pkg_rmleaves - deinstall 'leaf' packages

SYNOPSIS
       pkg_rmleaves [-l]

DESCRIPTION
       pkg_rmleaves finds packages that are not required (depended on) by any
       other installed package and lets you decide (in a beautiful BSD dialog
       interface) for each one if you want to keep it or delete it.

       Once the packages marked for removal have been deinstalled, you'll be
       asked if you want to do another run to see packages that have become
       'leaves' now because you've deinstalled the package(s) that depended on
       them. In every run you will be shown only packages that you haven't
       decided to keep yet in a previous run.

       This version automatically detects if you are using the new pkg(8)
       package management system (also known as pkgng) or still the old pkg_*
       tools.  It works with both package management systems, but may show
       more information with the new pkg(8) system.

OPTIONS
       -l     List leaf packages only, one per line, and don't ask for
              anything to be deinstalled.
