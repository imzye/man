PCAP_FILENO(3)         FreeBSD Library Functions Manual         PCAP_FILENO(3)



NAME
       pcap_fileno - get the file descriptor for a live capture

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       int pcap_fileno(pcap_t *p);

DESCRIPTION
       If p refers to a network device that was opened for a live capture
       using a combination of pcap_create(3) and pcap_activate(3), or using
       pcap_open_live(3), pcap_fileno() returns the file descriptor from which
       captured packets are read.

       If p refers to a ``savefile'' that was opened using functions such as
       pcap_open_offline(3) or pcap_fopen_offline(3), a ``dead'' pcap_t opened
       using pcap_open_dead(3), or a pcap_t that was created with
       pcap_create() but that has not yet been activated with pcap_activate(),
       it returns PCAP_ERROR.
