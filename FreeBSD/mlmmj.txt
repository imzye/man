mlmmj-bounce(1)         FreeBSD General Commands Manual        mlmmj-bounce(1)

NAME
     mlmmj-bounce – bounce handling utility for mlmmj

SYNOPSIS
     mlmmj-bounce --L /path/to/list [-a john=doe.org | -d] [-n num | -p]

DESCRIPTION
     -a       Address string that bounces

     -d       Parse the mail to extract the address via the DSN (RFC1891)

     -h       Print help

     -L path  Full path to list directory

     -n       Message number in the archive that bounced

     -p       Send out a probe

     -V       Print version

     mlmmj-bounce is used to handle mails that are bouncing.  When a mail
     arrives to the system, mlmmj-bounce will register in
     <listdir>/bounce/<addrstring> info about which number that bounced at
     what time.  An example of such a line could be:

           109:1094409801 # Sun Sep  5 20:43:21 2004

     The above shows that message number 109 bounced 1094409801 seconds after
     epoch which is in human date stamps is Sunday September 5th 20:43:21
     2004.

     The last bounce mail received to the address is saved in
     <listdir>/bounce/<addrstring>.lastmsg.

     When the -p option is used it sends out a probe email including info that
     it's a bounce probe and a list of the bounced message numbers.  The
     existence of a <listdir>/bounce/<addrstring>.probe file indicates that a
     probe have been sent out.
