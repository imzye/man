Chemistry::File::SLN(3)                    User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Chemistry::File::SLN - SLN linear notation parser/writer

SYNOPSYS
           #!/usr/bin/perl
           use Chemistry::File::SLN;

           # parse a SLN string for benzene
           my $s = 'C[1]H:CH:CH:CH:CH:CH@1';
           my $mol = Chemistry::Mol->parse($s, format => 'sln');

           # print a SLN string
           print $mol->print(format => 'sln');

           # print a unique (canonical) SLN string
           print $mol->print(format => 'sln', unique => 1);

           # parse a multiline SLN file
           my @mols = Chemistry::Mol->read("file.sln", format => 'sln');

           # write a multiline SLN file
           Chemistry::Mol->write("file.sln", mols => [@mols]);

DESCRIPTION
       This module parses a SLN (Sybyl Line Notation) string. This is a File
       I/O driver for the PerlMol project.  <http://www.perlmol.org/>. It
       registers the 'sln' format with Chemistry::Mol, and recognizes
       filenames ending in '.sln'.

       Optional attributes for atoms, bonds, and molecules are stored as
       $atom->attr("sln/attr"), $bond->attr("sln/attr"), and
       $mol->attr("sln/attr"), respectively. Boolean attributes are stored
       with a value of 'TRUE'. That's the way boolean attributes are
       recognized when writing, so that they can be written in the shortened
       form.

           $sln_attr->{backbone} = 1;
           # would be ouput as "C[backbone=1]"

           $sln_attr->{backbone} = 'TRUE';
           # would be ouput as "C[backbone]"

       Also note that attribute names are normalized to lowercase on reading.

OPTIONS
       The following options are available when reading:

       kekulize
           Assign bond orders for unsatisfied valences or for aromatic bonds.
           For example, benzene read as C[1]H:CH:CH:CH:CH:CH@1 will be
           converted internally to something like C[1]H=CHCH=CHCH=CH@1. This
           is needed if another format or module expects a Kekule
           representation without an aromatic bond type.

       The following options are available when writing:

       mols
           If this option points to an array of molecules, these molecules
           will be written, one per line, as in the example in the SYNOPSYS.

       aromatic
           Detect aromaticity before writing. This will ensure that aromatic
           bond types are used instead of alternate single and double bonds.

       unique
           Canonicalize before writing, and produce a unique strucure. NOTE:
           this option does not guarantee a unique representation for
           molecules with bracketed attributes.

       name
           Include the name of the molecule ($mol->name) in the output string.

       coord3d, coords
           Include the 3D coordinates of every atom in the molecule in the
           output string.  "coord3d" and "coords" may be used interchangeably.

       attr
           Output the atom, bond, and molecule attributes found in
           $mol->attr("sln/attr"), etc.

CAVEATS
       This version does not implement the full SLN specification. It supports
       simple structures and some attributes, but it does not support any of
       the following:

       Macro atoms
       Pattern matching options
       Markush structures
       2D Coordinates

       The SLN specification is vague on several points, and I don't have a
       reference implementation available, so I had to make several arbitrary
       decisions. Also, this version of this module has not been tested
       exhaustively, so please report any bugs that you find.

       If the parser doesn't understand a string, it only says "syntax error",
       which may not be very helpful.
