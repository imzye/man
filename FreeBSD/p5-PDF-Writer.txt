NAME
       PDF::Writer - PDF writer abstraction layer

VERSION
       This document describes version 0.05 of PDF::Writer, released Oct 25,
       2005.

SYNOPSIS
         use PDF::Writer;

         # Or, to explicitly specify a back-end ...
         use PDF::Writer 'pdflib';
         use PDF::Writer 'pdfapi2';
         use PDF::Writer 'mock';

         my $writer = PDF::Writer->new;

DESCRIPTION
       This is a generalized API that allows a module that generates PDFs to
       transparently target multiple backends without changing its code. The
       currently supported backends are:

       •   PDF::API2

           Available from CPAN

       •   PDFlib (versions 3+)

           Available from "/www.pdflib.com" in http;. There is both a pay and
           free version.  PDF::Writer will work with both, within their
           limitations. Please see the appropriate documentation for details.

       •   Mock

           This allows modules that target PDF::Writer to write their tests
           against a mock interface. Please see PDF::Writer::mock for more
           information.

       If both PDF::API2 and pdflib_pl are available, PDF::API2 is preferred.
       If neither is available, a run-time exception will be thrown. You must
       explicitly load the PDF::Writer::mock driver, if you wish to use it.

METHODS
       •   new()

           This acts as a factory, loading the appropriate PDF::Writer driver.

CODE COVERAGE
       We use Devel::Cover to test the code coverage of our tests. Below is
       the Devel::Cover report on this module's test suite.
