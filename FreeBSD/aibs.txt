AIBS(4)                FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                AIBS(4)

NAME
     aibs – ASUSTeK AI Booster ACPI ATK0110 voltage, temperature and fan
     sensor

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following line in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device aibs

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           aibs_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The aibs driver provides support for the voltage, temperature and fan
     sensors available through the ATK0110 ASOC ACPI device on ASUSTeK
     motherboards.  The number of sensors of each type, as well as the
     description of each sensor, varies according to the motherboard.

     The driver supports an arbitrary set of sensors, provides descriptions
     regarding what each sensor is used for, and reports the current values as
     well as the supposed range specifications of each sensor's input as
     defined by the motherboard manufacturer through ACPI.

     The range specifications are as follows:

     •   Voltage sensors have a lower and an upper range specification.

     •   Temperature sensors have two upper specifications.

     •   Fan sensors may either have only the lower specification, or,
         depending on the DSDT, one lower and one upper specification.

     Sensor readings and the range specifications are made available through
     the sysctl(3) interface, and can be monitored with sysctl(8).  For
     example, on an ASUS V3-P5G965 barebone:

           > sysctl dev.aibs.0.{volt,temp,fan}
           dev.aibs.0.volt.0: 1192 850 1600
           dev.aibs.0.volt.1: 3312 2970 3630
           dev.aibs.0.volt.2: 5017 4500 5500
           dev.aibs.0.volt.3: 12302 10200 13800
           dev.aibs.0.temp.0: 28.0C 80.0C 95.0C
           dev.aibs.0.temp.1: 55.0C 60.0C 95.0C
           dev.aibs.0.fan.0: 878 600 7200
           dev.aibs.0.fan.1: 0 700 7200

           > sysctl -d dev.aibs.0.{volt,temp,fan}
           dev.aibs.0.volt:
           dev.aibs.0.volt.0: Vcore Voltage
           dev.aibs.0.volt.1:  +3.3 Voltage
           dev.aibs.0.volt.2:  +5 Voltage
           dev.aibs.0.volt.3:  +12 Voltage
           dev.aibs.0.temp:
           dev.aibs.0.temp.0: CPU Temperature
           dev.aibs.0.temp.1: MB Temperature
           dev.aibs.0.fan:
           dev.aibs.0.fan.0: CPU FAN Speed
           dev.aibs.0.fan.1: CHASSIS FAN Speed

     Generally, sensors provided by the aibs driver may also be supported by
     certain other drivers or utilities that access the ISA / LPC or I2C /
     SMBus devices directly.  The precise collection of aibs sensors is
     comprised of the sensors specifically utilised in the motherboard design,
     which may be supported through a combination of one or more physical
     hardware monitoring chips.

     The aibs driver, however, provides the following advantages when compared
     to the native hardware monitoring drivers or other utilities:

     •   Sensor values from aibs are expected to be more reliable.  For
         example, voltage sensors in many hardware monitoring chips can only
         sense voltage from 0 to 2 or 4 volts, and the excessive voltage is
         removed by the resistors, which may vary with the motherboard and
         with the voltage that is being sensed.  In aibs, the required
         resistor factors are provided by the motherboard manufacturer through
         ACPI; in the native drivers, the resistor factors are encoded into
         the driver based on the chip manufacturer's recommendations.  In
         essence, sensor values from aibs are very likely to be identical to
         the readings from the Hardware Monitor screen in the BIOS.

     •   Sensor descriptions from aibs are more likely to match the markings
         on the motherboard.

     •   Sensor range specifications are supported by aibs.  The range
         specification is reported for each individual sensor as suggested by
         the motherboard manufacturer.  For example, the threshold for the CPU
         temperature sensor is likely to be significantly higher than that for
         the chassis temperature sensor.

     •   Support for newer chips in aibs.  Newer chips may miss a native
         driver, but should be supported through aibs regardless.
