NAME
       libgphoto2 - cross-platform digital camera library

SYNOPSIS
       #include <gphoto2/gphoto2.h>

DESCRIPTION
       The gphoto2 library provides applications with access to a variety of
       cameras.

       This man page will be extended with autogenerated documentation of the
       interface types and methods used for communication between the gphoto2
       library and a frontend.

FILES
       ~/.gphoto/settings
              Here gphoto2 applications may store their configuration used to
              access gphoto2.

       To track down errors, you can add the --debug parameter to the gphoto2
       command line and, if dealing with USB problems, setting the environment
       variable USB_DEBUG=1.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       CAMLIBS
              If set, defines the directory where the libgphoto2 library looks
              for its camera drivers (camlibs). You only need to set this on
              Windows systems and broken/test installations.

       IOLIBS If set, defines the directory where the libgphoto2_port library
              looks for its I/O drivers (iolibs). You only need to set this on
              Windows systems and broken/test installations.

       LD_DEBUG
              Set this to all to receive lots of debug information regarding
              library loading on ld based systems.

       USB_DEBUG
              If set, defines the numeric debug level with which the libusb
              library will print messages. In order to get some debug output,
              set it to 1.
