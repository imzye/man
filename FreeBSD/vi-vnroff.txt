NAME
       vnroff - Vietnamese pre-processor for groff

SYNTAX
       vnroff filename | groff [groff-options]

DESCRIPTION
       This program processes a text file with special Vietnamese character
       sequences (VIQR syntax) giving an output suitable for groff(1)
       processing.  The output should work for all point sizes supported by
       groff(1)

       The default diacritical marks are defined as:
            Dau_Sac         ´
            Dau_Huyen       `
            Dau_Hoi         ?
            Dau_Nga         ~
            Dau_Nang        .
            Dau_Mu          ^
            Dau_Trang       (
            Dau_Rau         +
            Escape_Symbol   \


SPELLING RULES
       Only one diacritical mark:
            vowel followed by symbol

       Two diacritical marks:
            vowel followed by Dau_Mu, Dau_Trang, Dau_Rau then other symbols.

       DD and dd: self-explanatory,
           the resulting case is the same as the first character of the
       sequence.

       The Escape_Symbol is provided to avoid the confusion between the
       diacritical marks and end-of-sentence symbols.
            i.e: the question           Anh ddi dda^u?
                 should be typed        Anh ddi dda^u\?
