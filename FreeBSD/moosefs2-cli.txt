NAME
       mfscli - CGI in TXT mode

SYNOPSIS
       mfscli [-pn28] [-H master_host] [-P master_port] [-f 0..3]
       -S(IN|IM|LI|IG|MU|IC|IL|CS|MB|HD|EX|MS|MO|QU) [-s separator] [-o
       order_id [-r]] [-m mode_id]

       mfscli [-pn28] [-H master_host] [-P master_port] [-f 0..3]
       -C(RC/ip/port|BW/ip/port|M[01]/ip/port|RS/sessionid)

       mfscli -h

DESCRIPTION
       mfscli is a commandline counterpart to MooseFS's CGI interface. All the
       information available in CGI (except for graphs) can be obtained via
       CLI using different "monitoring options"

OPTIONS
       -h     print help message

       -p     force plain text format on tty devices

       -n     do not resolve ip adresses (default when output device is not
              tty)

       -s separator
              field separator to use in plain text format on tty devices
              (forces -p)

       -2     force 256-color terminal color codes

       -8     force 8-color terminal color codes

       -H master_host
              master address (default: mfsmaster)

       -P master_port
              master client port (default: 9421)

       -f 0..3
              set frame charset to be displayed as table frames in ttymode;

              0      simple ascii frames '+','-','|' (default)

              1      thick unicode frames

              2      thin unicode frames

              3      double unicode frames (dos style)

       -o order_id
              sort data by column specified by 'order id' (depends on data
              set)

       -r     reverse sort order

       -m mode_id
              show data specified by 'mode id' (depends on data set)

MONITORING OPTIONS
       -SIN   show full master info

       -SIM   show only masters states

       -SLI   show only licence info

       -SIG   show only general master (leader) info

       -SMU   show only master memory usage

       -SIC   show only chunks info (goal/copies matrices)

       -SIL   show only loop info (with messages)

       -SCS   show connected chunk servers

       -SMB   show connected metadata backup servers

       -SHD   show hdd data

       -SEX   show exports

       -SMS   show active mounts

       -SMO   show operation counters

       -SQU   show quota info

       -SMC   show master charts data

       -SCC   show chunkserver charts data

COMMANDS
       -CRC/ip/port
              remove selected chunkserver from list of active chunkservers

       -CBW/ip/port
              send selected chunkserver back to work state (from grace state)

       -CM1/ip/port
              switch selected chunkserver to maintenance mode

       -CM0/ip/port
              switch selected chunkserver to standard mode (from maintenance
              mode)

       -CRS/sessionid
              remove selected session

EXAMPLES
       mfscli -SIC -2
              shows table with chunk state matrix (number of chunks for each
              combination of valid copies and goal set by user) using extended
              terminal colors (256-colors)

       mfscli -SCS -f 1
              shows table with all chunkservers using unicode thick frames

       mfscli -SMS -p -s ','
              shows current sessions (mounts) using plain text format and coma
              as a separator
