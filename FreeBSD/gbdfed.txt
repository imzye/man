GBDFED(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              GBDFED(1)

NAME
       gbdfed - GTK-based BDF font editor


SYNOPSIS
       gbdfed [options] [fonts ...]


DESCRIPTION
       gbdfed lets you interactively create new bitmap font files or modify
       existing ones.  It allows editing multiple fonts and multiple glyphs,
       it allows cut and paste operations between fonts and glyphs and editing
       font properties.  gbdfed can import Metafont PK/GF fonts, Han Bitmap
       Font Format (HBF) fonts, Linux console fonts (PSF, CP, and EGA/VGA)
       fonts, Sun VF fonts, OpenType/TrueType (OTF/TTF) fonts, or grab a font
       from the X server (when running under X11).  gbdfed can export PSF2
       Linux console fonts and HEX fonts (see online help).

       gbdfed works on X Window System Version 11 (X11), Release 5 or 6, with
       GTK+ 2.6 or greater. It may work on Windows, but hasn't been tested
       yet.


OPTIONS
       gbdfed accepts the following command line arguments:


       -nc     do not preserve comments (by default, gbdfed automatically
               collects comments that are saved with the font).

       -nu     do not preserve unencoded glyphs (by default, gbdfed preserves
               the unencoded glyphs).

       -nm     do not make metrics corrections (by default, gbdfed attempts to
               make metrics corrections automatically).

       -np     do not pad character-cell bitmaps (by default, gbdfed pads
               character-cell bitmaps with 0's to the cell dimensions when the
               font is saved).

       -bp     allow blank pages (by default, gbdfed skips blank pages).

       -ed     do not present the "Really Exit?" dialog (by default, this
               dialog always presented).

       -ps n   set default point size (if unspecified, gbdfed sets it to 12).

       -hres n set default horizontal resolution.

       -vres n set default vertical resolution.

       -res n  set both default resolutions (if unspecified, gbdfed sets both
               horizontal and vertical resolution to that of display, (e.g.
               90x90 dpi for Sun workstations).

       -sp s   set the default font spacing ("p" for Proportional, "m" for
               Monowidth, or "c" for Character Cell).

       -eol e  set the default end-of-line type ("u" for Unix LF, "d" for
               DOS/Windows CRLF, or "m" for Macintosh CR).  CR)

       -g glyph-code
               specify the initial glyph code at startup.  The glyph code can
               be specified in decimal, octal, or hex.  Octal numbers must be
               prefixed with the digit 0, and hex numbers must be prefixed
               with one of: 0x, 0X, U+, U-, \u.

       -cb code-base
               specify the code base used to display the glyphs encodings (can
               be "octal", "decimal", or "hexadecimal").


FONT GRID
       At the top of each editor window there are some fields and buttons.
       These are:

              The "Font" text field is where the font name is set so it can be
              edited.

              The "Glyph" field is a label that provides some information
              about glyph name, encoding, and metrics when a glyph is
              selected.  When a range of glyphs are selected, this field
              displays the start and end codes of the range.

              The push buttons are used to navigate through the glyph pages.
              The "Previous Page" and "Next Page" buttons normally skip glyph
              pages that are empty, but that can be changed using the
              "Preferences" dialog.

              The "Page" field indicates the current glyph page and also
              allows a specific page number to be entered.  Once a page number
              is entered, pressing the Return key will cause the Font Grid to
              shift to that page.  The page number entered is assumed to be a
              decimal number.

              The "Code" field is provided for situations where the page
              number is not known, but the encoding is known.  The encoding
              entered in this field must be in the base (8, 10, or 16) that is
              currently being used to display glyph encodings (see the "View"
              menu below).  Once the encoding is entered, pressing the Return
              key will cause the Font Grid to shift to the page containing the
              encoding.

       The main window of each font editor is called the Font Grid.  Each Font
       Grid has a clipboard used for passing glyphs around.  This clipboard is
       called FONTGRID_CLIPBOARD.  The format of the data stored to this
       clipboard is not documented yet.

       When a glyph has been modified either by the user or by automatic
       metrics corrections when the font is loaded, the glyph code above the
       glyph cell will be highlighted.


Font Grid Menus
       The File menu has the following entries:

       New <Ctrl+N>
           This creates a new font using the current defaults for point size,
           horizontal and vertical resolution, and font spacing.

       Open <Ctrl+O>
           This opens a new font in the current Font Grid.  If the font in the
           grid has been modified, the option to save the font before loading
           a new one will be given.

       Save <Ctrl+S>
           Save the current font.  If the current font does not have a file
           name, a file selection dialog will pop up so a file name can be
           entered.
           When the font is saved, it will automatically generate a list of
           _XFREE86_GLYPH_RANGE properties containing a list of glyph codes
           available in the font.

       Save As <Ctrl+W>
           Save the current font with some other name.
           When the font is saved, it will automatically generate a list of
           _XFREE86_GLYPH_RANGE properties containing a list of glyph codes
           available in the font.

       The Import submenu of the File menu has the following entries:

           PK/GF Font <Ctrl+K>
               Import a Metafont PK or GF font.

           Console Font <Ctrl+L>
               Import a binary console font used by Linux and Sun (PSF1, PSF2,
               CP, vfont, and other font formats).

           HBF Font <Ctrl+H>
               Import an HBF font. Only available if HBF support is compiled
               into gbdfed.

           Windows Font <Ctrl+B>
               Import a Windows FON/FNT font.  This will also import fonts
               from .EXE and .DLL files as well.

           OpenType/TrueType Font <Ctrl+Y>
               Import an OpenType/TrueType font (.otf or .ttf extension) or a
               TrueType collection (.ttc extension).

           Server Font <Ctrl+G>
               Import a font from the X server if running under the X
               Windowing System.

       The Export submenu of the File menu has the following entries:

           PSF <Ctrl+F>
               This will export the current BDF font or the currently selected
               glyphs to a PSF2 font.  Glyphs in PSF fonts are usually
               arranged in a specific way to make them work properly with the
               basic display driver.  Many of these fonts come with mapping
               tables attached that indicate which Unicode characters a glyph
               can be used for.  The mapping table allows the console to
               attempt to display Unicode text.

               During the export, an option menu will let you select whether
               to:

                 Export Font with Mapping Table
                 Export Font Only
                 Export Mapping Table Only

               Only the first 512 glyphs will be exported to the font.

           HEX
               This will export the current BDF font into the HEX format (see
               http://czyborra.com/unifont/).

       Exit/Close <Ctrl+F4>
           Exit the program if this is the primary Font Grid or simply hide
           (unmap) the current Font Grid window.

       The Edit menu has the following entries:

       Copy <Ctrl+C> or <Button3Down>
           This copies the current selection to the Font Grid clipboard.

       Cut <Ctrl+X> or <Key>Delete or <Key>BackSpace
           This copies the current selection to the Font Grid clipboard and
           then deletes the selection.

       Paste <Ctrl+V> or <Button2Down>
           This replaces the glyphs starting at the currently selected
           position with the Font Grid clipboard.

       Overlay <Ctrl+Shift+V> or Ctrl<Button2Down>
           This merges the glyphs on the Font Grid cliboard with the glyphs
           starting at the currently selected position.  This means that the
           bitmaps are actually combined together. The names of the modified
           glyphs are not changed.

       Insert <Ctrl+Meta+V> or Shift<Button2Down>
           This inserts the glyphs on the Font Grid clipboard in front of the
           currently selected position.

       Properties <Ctrl+P>
           This invokes the font property editor.

       Comments <Ctrl+M>
           This invokes the font comments editor.

       Font Info <Ctrl+I>
           This invokes a dialog that allows changes to some of the font
           information so these values do not have to be changed using the
           property editor.  These values include the default character, font
           device width (for monowidth and character cell fonts), font ascent
           and descent, font vertical and horizontal resolution, and the font
           spacing.

       The Font Name submenu of the Edit menu has the following four entries:

           Make XLFD Name
               If the font does not have an XLFD name, this will save the
               current font name in the _ORIGINAL_FONT_NAME font property and
               then generate an XLFD name for the font.

           Update Name From Properties
               This will update the XLFD font name fields from the font
               property list.

           Update Properties From Name
               This will update the font properties from the XLFD font name.

           Update Average Width
               This will update the average width field of the XLFD font name
               and will update the AVERAGE_WIDTH font property as a side
               effect.

       Name Glyphs

           Unicode Names
               This will rename all the glyphs using names taken from a file
               in the Unicode Character Database format.  This file can be set
               in the configuration file or set using the Setup dialog.

           Unicode Values
               This will rename all the glyphs with a hexadecimal value
               prefixed by 0x, U+, or \u (example: 0x010D, U+010D, \u010D).

       Test Glyphs <Ctrl+Z>
               This will toggle the glyph test dialog on or off for the
               editor.  When this is active, selecting a glyph from any Font
               Grid will also add it to the glyph test dialog.  When changes
               are made to a glyph or the font bounding box, the glyph test
               dialog will be updated accordingly.

               The glyph test dialog provides a toggle to turn the baseline on
               or off and another toggle to draw from right to left instead of
               left to right.

       Setup <Ctrl+T>
               This will invoke the dialog to edit various settings used by
               the editor such as the default point size, resolution and font
               spacing.

       The View menu has the following entries:

       Unencoded <Ctrl+E>
           This will toggle between displaying the unencoded (glyphs with an
           ENCODING field of -1) and encoded glyphs.

       Code Base
           Selects displaying of glyph encoding.  Options are Octal (base 8),
           Decimal (base 10) or Hexadecimal (base 16).

       Other Page <Ctrl+Shift+S>
           This will toggle between the current page and the last page that
           was viewed.

       Vertical View <Ctrl+Q>
           This will toggle the FontGrid between showing the glyphs
           horizontally (default) and vertically.

       Messages <Ctrl+A>
           This will show messages generated when corrections to the font
           metrics are done or errors are encountered.

       The Operations menu has the following entries:

       Translate <Ctrl+D>
           This will bring up the dialog for entering the X offset and Y
           offset used to translate the glyph to a new location.

           The option of translating the selected glyphs or all of the glyphs
           is provided.

       Rotate <Ctrl+R>
           This will bring up the dialog for entering the rotation angle.  The
           rotation is limited to between plus or minus 1 and 359 degrees.

           The option of rotating the selected glyphs or all of the glyphs is
           provided.

       Shear <Ctrl+J>
           This will bring up the dialog for entering theangle of the shear.
           The shear is limited to plus or minus 45 degrees.

           The option of rotating the selected glyphs or all of the glyphs is
           provided.

       Embolden <Ctrl+Shift+B>
           This will bring up the dialog for emboldening either the selected
           or all glyphs.

           To embolden means to make bold.

       The Editors menu has the following entries:

       New <Ctrl+N>
           This will cause a new editor to be created using the point size,
           resolution, and bits per pixel set in the config file, from the
           command line or from the Setup dialog.

       [editor list]
           The remaining menu items are all the Font Grid's that have been
           created.  Choosing one will force that window to be made visible
           (mapped) and also put that window on top.


Font Grid Other Features
       Double clicking the mouse on one of the glyphs will start a Glyph
       Editor for that glyph.

       The font name can be edited in the Font Grid and page switching can be
       done with the buttons on the Font Grid.


GLYPH EDITOR
       The Glyph Editor provides a simple bitmap editor designed to edit glyph
       bitmaps and other glyph information.  The Glyph Editors all use a
       special clipboard used to pass bitmaps between the Glyph Editors.  This
       clipboard is called GLYPHEDIT_CLIPBOARD.

       The only limit on the number of Glyph Editors that can be open at one
       time is the amount of memory.


Glyph Editor Menus
       The File menu has the following entries:

       Update <Ctrl+S>
           This will update the Font Grid with the modified glyph.
           To the right of the Glyph Name field is a button that performs the
           same function.

       Update and Next <Ctrl+U>
           This will update the FontGrid with the modified glyph and move to
           the next glyph.

       Update and Previous <Ctrl+B>
           This will update the FontGrid with the modified glyph and move to
           the previous glyph.

       Close <Ctrl+F4>
           This will close the Glyph Editor.

       The Edit menu has the following entries:

       Reload <Ctrl+L>
           This will reload the glyph and discard any changes made in the
           GlyphEditor.

       Copy <Ctrl+C>
           This will copy the currently selected portion of the bitmap to the
           Glyph Editor clipboard.

       Cut <Ctrl+X>
           This will copy the currently selected portion of the bitmap to the
           Glyph Editor clipboard and then delete the selection.

       Paste <Ctrl+V>
           This will paste the contents of the Glyph Editor clipboard into the
           current Glyph Editor with the top-left coordinate of the bitmap on
           the clipboard pasted at the location of the mouse.  If the bitmap
           is too big to fit if it is pasted at the mouse location, the bitmap
           will be shifted until it fits completely in the Glyph Editor.

       Select All <Ctrl+A>
           This will select the whole glyph bitmap.

       Next Glyph <Ctrl+N>
           This will move the Glyph Editor to the next glyph position in the
           Font Grid.  If the current glyph has been modified, a save prompt
           will appear before moving to the next glyph.
           To the right of the Glyph Name field is a button that performs the
           same function.

       Previous Glyph <Ctrl+P>
           This will move the Glyph Editor to the previous glyph position in
           the Font Grid.  If the current glyph has been modified, a save
           prompt will appear before moving to the previous glyph.
           To the right of the Glyph Name field is a button that performs the
           same function.

       The Operation menu has the following entries:

       Draw <Ctrl+D>
           Change the Glyph Editor into Draw mode.

       Move <Ctrl+M>
           Change the Glyph Editor into Move mode.  Move mode allows selecting
           a portion of the glyph bitmap and moving it to another location.

       Copy <Ctrl+Y>
           Change the Glyph Editor into Copy mode.  Copy mode allows copying a
           portion of the glyph bitmap and moving it to another location.

       Rotate <Ctrl+T>
           This will invoke the rotation dialog that allows the degrees of
           rotation to be specified.  Rotation can be between 1 and 359
           degrees.

       Shear <Ctrl+E>
           This will invoke the shear dialog that allows the degrees of
           horizontal shear to be specified.  Other names for shearing are
           obliquing or slanting.  Shearing is allowed between 1 and 45
           degrees.

       Embolden <Ctrl+H>
           This will embolden the glyph in a simple manner.

       Resize BBX <Ctrl+R>
           This will allow changing the sizes of the glyph bounding box
           including the left/right bearings and the glyph ascent/descent.  If
           this change causes the glyph bounding box to be larger than the
           font bounding box, the font bounding box will be resized when the
           glyph is saved next.

       Edit PSF Unicode Mappings <Ctrl+F>
           This allows adding, deleting and editing of Unicode mappings for
           fonts that will be exported as PSF fonts. The code valued entered
           are expected to be in hexadecimal.


Glyph Editor Other Features
       When the mouse is used to shift the bitmap using one of the buttons,
       holding the mouse down will cause the activity to repeat.
