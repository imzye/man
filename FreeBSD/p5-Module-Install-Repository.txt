Module::Install::Repository(3)             User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Module::Install::Repository - Automatically sets repository URL from
       svn/svk/Git checkout

SYNOPSIS
         # in Makefile.PL
         use inc::Module::Install;
         auto_set_repository;

DESCRIPTION
       Module::Install::Repository is a Module::Install plugin to
       automatically figure out repository URL and set it via repository()
       which then will be added to resources under META.yml.

CAVEATS
       The regular expression to rewrite Git repository URL to public clone
       URL is dependent on the server side directory layout, which means this
       module currently works only with github.com style.
