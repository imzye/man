NAME
       B::Deobfuscate - Deobfuscate source code

SYNOPSIS
         perl -MO=Deobfuscate,-csynthetic.yml,-y synthetic.pl

DESCRIPTION
       B::Deobfuscate is a backend module for the Perl compiler that generates
       perl source code, based on the internal compiled structure that perl
       itself creates after parsing a program. It adds symbol renaming
       functions to the B::Deparse module. An obfuscated program is already
       parsed and interpreted correctly by the B::Deparse program.
       Unfortunately, if the obfuscation involved variable renaming then the
       resulting program also has obfuscated symbols.

       This module takes the last step and fixes names like $z5223ed336 to be
       a word from a dictionary. While the name still isn't meaningful it is
       at least easier to distinguish and read. Here are two examples - one
       from B::Deparse and one from B::Deobfuscate.

       Initial input

         if(@z6a703c020a){(my($z5a5fa8125d,$zcc158ad3e0)=File::Temp::tempfile(
         'UNLINK',1));print($z5a5fa8125d "=over 8\n\n");(print($z5a5fa8125d
         @z6a703c020a)or die(((("Can't print $zcc158ad3e0: $!"))); print($z5a5fa8125d
         "=back\n");(close(*$z5a5fa8125d)or die(((("Can't close ".*$za5fa8125d.": $!")
         ));(@z8374cc586e=$zcc158ad3e0);($z9e5935eea4=1);}

       After B::Deparse:

         if (@z6a703c020a) {
             (my($z5a5fa8125d, $zcc158ad3e0) = File::Temp::tempfile('UNLINK', 1));
             print($z5a5fa8125d "=over 8\n\n");
             (print($z5a5fa8125d @z6a703c020a)
                 or die((((q[Can't print ] . $zcc158ad3e0) . ': ') . $!)));
             print($z5a5fa8125d "=back\n");
             (close(*$z5a5fa8125d)
                 or die((((q[Can't close ] . *$za5fa8125d) . ': ' . $!)));
             (@z8374cc586e = $zcc158ad3e0);
             ($z9e5935eea4 = 1);
         }

       After B::Deobfuscate:

         if (@parenthesises) {
             (my($scrupulousity, $postprocesser) = File::Temp::tempfile('UNLINK', 1));
             print($scrupulousity "=over 8\n\n");
             (print($scrupulousity @parenthesises)
                 or die((((q[Can't print ] . $postprocesser) . ': ') . $!)));
             print($scrupulousity "=back\n");
             (close(*$scrupulousity)
                 or die((((q[Can't close ] . *$postprocesser) . ': ') . $!)));
             (@interruptable = $postprocesser);
             ($propagandaist = 1);
         }

       You'll note that the only real difference is that instead of variable
       names like $z9e5935eea4 you get $propagandist.

OPTIONS
       As with all compiler backend options, these must follow directly after
       the '-MO=Deobfuscate', separated by a comma but not any white space.
       All options defined in B::Deparse are supported here - see the
       B::Deparse documentation page to see what options are provided and how
       to use them.

       -dDICTIONARY FILE
           Normally B::Deobfuscate reads an internal dictionary of easily
           pronounced keywords. If you would like to specify a different
           dictionary follow the -d parameter with the path to the dictionary
           file. The path may not have commas in it and only lines in the
           dictionary that do not match /\W/ will be used.  The entire
           dictionary will be loaded into memory at once.

             -d/usr/share/dict/stop

       -DB::Deobfuscate::Dict:: module
           B::Deobfuscate defaults to using the dictionary at
           B::Deobfuscate::Dict::PGPHashWords. You can ask it to load any
           other module under the B::Deobfuscate::Dict:: namespace by using
           the "-D..." parameter.

           B::Deobfuscate 0.14 and above is distributed with the additional
           dictionary B::Deobfuscate::Dict::Flowers.

       -mREGEX
           Supply a different regular expression for deciding which symbols to
           rename.  The default value is /\A[[:lower:][:digit:]_]+\z/. Your
           expression must be delimited by the '/' characters and you may not
           use that character within the expression. That shouldn't be an
           issue because '/' isn't valid in a symbol name anyway.

             -a/\A[[:lower:][:digit:]_]+\z/

       -y  print two YAML documents to STDOUT instead of the deparsed source
           code.  The first document is a configuration document suitable for
           use with the -c parameter. The second document is the deparsed
           source code. Use this feature to generate a configuration document
           for further, iterative reverse engineering.

           The intention here is that you could write some software to read
           this YAML document, present the information to the user, accept
           some alterations to the configuration and re-run the deobfuscator
           with the new input.

       -cFILENAME
           Supply a filename to a YAML configuration file. Normally you would
           generate this file by saving the results of the -y parameter to a
           file. You can then edit the file to provide your own names for
           symbols and not rely on the random symbol picker in B::Deobfuscate.
           You may create your own YAML configuration file as well.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       The B::Deobfuscation symbol renamer can be controlled with by a
       configuration file. Use of this feature requires the YAML module be
       installed.

        dictionary: '/usr/share/dict/propernames'
        global_regex: '(?:)'
        globals:
          kSDsfDS: Slartibartfast
          HGFdsfds: Triantaphyllos
        lexicals:
          '$SdfSd': '$No'
          '$GsdDd': '$Ed'
          '$Ksdfs': '$Ji'

       dictionary
           This is a filename path to the operative dictionary.

            dictionary: /usr/share/dict/stop

       global_regex
           This regular expression tests global symbols. Only symbols that
           match this expression may be renamed. The default value is
           '\A[[:lower:][:digit:]_]\z/.  In perl, global symbols are
           independent of their sigil so the values being tested are bare.
           Future versions of B::Deobfuscate may add the sigil to the symbol
           name.

            global_regex: '\A[[:lower:][:digit:]_]\z'

       globals
           This is a hash detailing symbol names as used in the original
           source and the name used in the deobfuscated source. For example -
           if the original source has a variable named @z12345 and you wish to
           rename all occurrances to @URLList then the hash would associate
           'z12345' with 'URLList'. The dictionary picker fills these values
           in automatically.

           If you wish to prevent B::Deobfuscate from renaming a symbol then
           specify the new value as '~' (which in YAML terms is undef).

            globals:
              catfile: ~
              opt_n: ~
              opt_t: ~
              opt_u: ~
              z1234567890: Postprocesser
              z2345678901: Constructable
              z3456789012: Photosynthesises
              z4567890123: Undiscriminate
              z5678901234: Parenthesises
              z6789012345: Animadvertion

       lexicals
           Lexicals is a hash exactly like `globals' except that all the
           symbol names include the sigil which doesn't currently happen for
           globals.

            lexicals:
              '$k1234567890': '$ivs'
              '$k2345678901': '$ehs'
              '$k3456789012': '$ans'
              '$k4567890123': '$ons'
              '$k5678901234': '$ofs'
              '$k6789012345': '$gos'
              '$k7890123456': '$dus'
              '$k8901234567': '$iis'
              '$k9012345678': '$ats'
              '$k0123456780': '$ets'
