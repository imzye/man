Devel::SimpleTrace(3)                      User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Devel::SimpleTrace - See where you code warns and dies using stack
       traces

VERSION
       Version 0.08

SYNOPSIS
       On the command-line:

           perl -wMDevel::SimpleTrace program_with_strange_errors.pl

       Inside a module:

           use Devel::SimpleTrace;

DESCRIPTION
       This module can be used to more easily spot the place where a program
       or a module generates errors. Its use is extremely simple, reduced to
       just "use"ing it.

       This is achieved by modifying the functions warn() and die() in order
       to replace the standard messages by complete stack traces that
       precisely indicates how and where the error or warning occurred.  Other
       than this, their use should stay unchanged, even when using die()
       inside eval().

OPTIONS
       Options can be set at import time using:

           perl -wMDevel::SimpleTrace=option1,option2

       or

           use Devel::SimpleTrace qw(option1 option2);

       Available options are:

       "showrefs"
           Using this option will tell "Devel::SimpleTrace" to stringify
           objects and references passed in argument to die(). This option is
           disabled by default in order to leave objects and references
           untouched.

EXAMPLE
       For example, "HTTP::Proxy" 0.14 suffered from strange warnings, and its
       author Philippe Bruhat had a hard time trying to understand where they
       could come from.

           getsockname() on closed socket Symbol::GEN7 at /System/Library/Perl/darwin/IO/Socket.pm line 186.
           Use of uninitialized value in numeric ne (!=) at /Library/Perl/HTTP/Daemon.pm line 53.

       Hmm.. There's obviously something wrong here, but spotting the right
       line is not easy.

       Re-running the same script, unchanged, by just adding
       "-MDevel::SimpleTrace" to "perl" arguments produces the following
       output:

           getsockname() on closed socket Symbol::GEN7
                   at IO::Socket::sockname(/System/Library/Perl/darwin/IO/Socket.pm:186)
                   at IO::Socket::INET::sockport(/System/Library/Perl/IO/Socket/INET.pm:231)
                   at HTTP::Daemon::url(/Library/Perl/HTTP/Daemon.pm:52)
                   at HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn::get_request(/Library/Perl/HTTP/Daemon.pm:139)
                   at HTTP::Proxy::serve_connections(/Library/Perl/HTTP/Proxy.pm:500)
                   at HTTP::Proxy::start(/Library/Perl/HTTP/Proxy.pm:392)
                   at t::Utils::fork_proxy(t/Utils.pm:72)
                   at main::(t/50standard.t:138)
           Use of uninitialized value in numeric ne (!=)
                   at HTTP::Daemon::url(/Library/Perl/HTTP/Daemon.pm:53)
                   at HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn::get_request(/Library/Perl/HTTP/Daemon.pm:139)
                   at HTTP::Proxy::serve_connections(/Library/Perl/HTTP/Proxy.pm:500)
                   at HTTP::Proxy::start(/Library/Perl/HTTP/Proxy.pm:392)
                   at t::Utils::fork_proxy(t/Utils.pm:72)
                   at main::(t/50standard.t:138)

       Aha! Much better. Finding the bug is now a trivial task ";-)"

DIAGNOSTICS
       Unknown option: %s
           (W) This warning occurs if you try to set an unknown option.

CAVEATS
       This module is currently not compatible with other modules that also
       work by overriding die() and warn(), like "CGI::Carp".
