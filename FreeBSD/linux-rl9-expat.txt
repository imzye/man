NAME
       xmlwf - Determines if an XML document is well-formed

SYNOPSIS
       xmlwf [OPTIONS] [FILE ...]

       xmlwf -h

       xmlwf -v

DESCRIPTION
       xmlwf uses the Expat library to determine if an XML document is
       well-formed. It is non-validating.

       If you do not specify any files on the command-line, and you have a
       recent version of xmlwf, the input file will be read from standard
       input.

WELL-FORMED DOCUMENTS
       A well-formed document must adhere to the following rules:

       •   The file begins with an XML declaration. For instance, <?xml
           version="1.0" standalone="yes"?>.  NOTE: xmlwf does not currently
           check for a valid XML declaration.

       •   Every start tag is either empty (<tag/>) or has a corresponding end
           tag.

       •   There is exactly one root element. This element must contain all
           other elements in the document. Only comments, white space, and
           processing instructions may come after the close of the root
           element.

       •   All elements nest properly.

       •   All attribute values are enclosed in quotes (either single or
           double).

       If the document has a DTD, and it strictly complies with that DTD, then
       the document is also considered valid.  xmlwf is a non-validating
       parser -- it does not check the DTD. However, it does support external
       entities (see the -x option).

OPTIONS
       When an option includes an argument, you may specify the argument
       either separately ("-d output") or concatenated with the option
       ("-doutput").  xmlwf supports both.

       -a factor
           Sets the maximum tolerated amplification factor for protection
           against billion laughs attacks (default: 100.0). The amplification
           factor is calculated as ..

                           amplification := (direct + indirect) / direct


           .. while parsing, whereas <direct> is the number of bytes read from
           the primary document in parsing and <indirect> is the number of
           bytes added by expanding entities and reading of external DTD
           files, combined.

           NOTE: If you ever need to increase this value for non-attack
           payload, please file a bug report.

       -b bytes
           Sets the number of output bytes (including amplification) needed to
           activate protection against billion laughs attacks (default: 8
           MiB). This can be thought of as an "activation threshold".

           NOTE: If you ever need to increase this value for non-attack
           payload, please file a bug report.

       -c
           If the input file is well-formed and xmlwf doesn't encounter any
           errors, the input file is simply copied to the output directory
           unchanged. This implies no namespaces (turns off -n) and requires
           -d to specify an output directory.

       -d output-dir
           Specifies a directory to contain transformed representations of the
           input files. By default, -d outputs a canonical representation
           (described below). You can select different output formats using
           -c, -m and -N.

           The output filenames will be exactly the same as the input
           filenames or "STDIN" if the input is coming from standard input.
           Therefore, you must be careful that the output file does not go
           into the same directory as the input file. Otherwise, xmlwf will
           delete the input file before it generates the output file (just
           like running cat < file > file in most shells).

           Two structurally equivalent XML documents have a byte-for-byte
           identical canonical XML representation. Note that ignorable white
           space is considered significant and is treated equivalently to
           data. More on canonical XML can be found at
           http://www.jclark.com/xml/canonxml.html .

       -e encoding
           Specifies the character encoding for the document, overriding any
           document encoding declaration.  xmlwf supports four built-in
           encodings: US-ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16, and ISO-8859-1. Also see the -w
           option.

       -k
           When processing multiple files, xmlwf by default halts after the
           the first file with an error. This tells xmlwf to report the error
           but to keep processing. This can be useful, for example, when
           testing a filter that converts many files to XML and you want to
           quickly find out which conversions failed.

       -m
           Outputs some strange sort of XML file that completely describes the
           input file, including character positions. Requires -d to specify
           an output file.

       -n
           Turns on namespace processing. (describe namespaces) -c disables
           namespaces.

       -N
           Adds a doctype and notation declarations to canonical XML output.
           This matches the example output used by the formal XML test cases.
           Requires -d to specify an output file.

       -p
           Tells xmlwf to process external DTDs and parameter entities.

           Normally xmlwf never parses parameter entities.  -p tells it to
           always parse them.  -p implies -x.

       -q
           Disable reparse deferral, and allow quadratic parse runtime on
           large tokens (default: reparse deferral enabled).

       -r
           Normally xmlwf memory-maps the XML file before parsing; this can
           result in faster parsing on many platforms.  -r turns off
           memory-mapping and uses normal file IO calls instead. Of course,
           memory-mapping is automatically turned off when reading from
           standard input.

           Use of memory-mapping can cause some platforms to report
           substantially higher memory usage for xmlwf, but this appears to be
           a matter of the operating system reporting memory in a strange way;
           there is not a leak in xmlwf.

       -s
           Prints an error if the document is not standalone. A document is
           standalone if it has no external subset and no references to
           parameter entities.

       -t
           Turns on timings. This tells Expat to parse the entire file, but
           not perform any processing. This gives a fairly accurate idea of
           the raw speed of Expat itself without client overhead.  -t turns
           off most of the output options (-d, -m, -c, ...).

       -v
           Prints the version of the Expat library being used, including some
           information on the compile-time configuration of the library, and
           then exits.

       -w
           Enables support for Windows code pages. Normally, xmlwf will throw
           an error if it runs across an encoding that it is not equipped to
           handle itself. With -w, xmlwf will try to use a Windows code page.
           See also -e.

       -x
           Turns on parsing external entities.

           Non-validating parsers are not required to resolve external
           entities, or even expand entities at all. Expat always expands
           internal entities (?), but external entity parsing must be enabled
           explicitly.

           External entities are simply entities that obtain their data from
           outside the XML file currently being parsed.

           This is an example of an internal entity:

               <!ENTITY vers '1.0.2'>

           And here are some examples of external entities:

               <!ENTITY header SYSTEM "header-&vers;.xml">  (parsed)
               <!ENTITY logo SYSTEM "logo.png" PNG>         (unparsed)


       --
           (Two hyphens.) Terminates the list of options. This is only needed
           if a filename starts with a hyphen. For example:

               xmlwf -- -myfile.xml

           will run xmlwf on the file -myfile.xml.

       Older versions of xmlwf do not support reading from standard input.

OUTPUT
       xmlwf outputs nothing for files which are problem-free. If any input
       file is not well-formed, or if the output for any input file cannot be
       opened, xmlwf prints a single line describing the problem to standard
       output.

       If the -k option is not provided, xmlwf halts upon encountering a
       well-formedness or output-file error. If -k is provided, xmlwf
       continues processing the remaining input files, describing problems
       found with any of them.

EXIT STATUS
       For option -v or -h, xmlwf always exits with status code 0. For other
       cases, the following exit status codes are returned:

       0
           The input files are well-formed and the output (if requested) was
           written successfully.

       1
           An internal error occurred.

       2
           One or more input files were not well-formed or could not be
           parsed.

       3
           If using the -d option, an error occurred opening an output file.

       4
           There was a command-line argument error in how xmlwf was invoked.

BUGS
       The errors should go to standard error, not standard output.

       There should be a way to get -d to send its output to standard output
       rather than forcing the user to send it to a file.

       I have no idea why anyone would want to use the -d, -c, and -m options.
       If someone could explain it to me, I'd like to add this information to
       this manpage.
