NAME
     fsinfo – co-ordinate site-wide file system information

SYNOPSIS
     fsinfo [fl qv] [-a autodir] [-b bootparams] [-d dumpsets] [-e exports]
            [-f fstabs] [-h hostname] [-m automounts] [-I dir] [-D
            name[=string]] [-U name[=string]] config ...

DESCRIPTION
     This command is obsolete.  Users are advised to use autofs(5) instead.

     The fsinfo utility takes a set of system configuration information, and
     generates a coordinated set of amd(8), mount(8) and mountd(8)
     configuration files.

     The following options are available:

     -a autodir  Specifies the directory name in which to place the
                 automounter's mount points.  This defaults to /a.

     -b bootparams_prefix
                 Specifies the prefix for the bootparams file.  If it is not
                 given, then the file will not be generated.  The file will be
                 constructed for the destination machine and will be placed
                 into a file named bootparams and prefixed by the
                 bootparams_prefix string.  The file generated contains a list
                 of entries describing each diskless client that can boot from
                 the destination machine.

     -d dumpsets_prefix
                 Specifies the prefix for the dumpsets file.  If it is not
                 specified, then the file will not be generated.  The file
                 will be for the destination machine and will be placed into a
                 file named dumpsets prefixed by the dumpsets_prefix string.
                 This file is for use by Imperial College's local backup
                 system.

     -e exports_prefix
                 Defines the prefix for the exports files.  If it is not
                 given, then the file will not be generated.  For each machine
                 defined in the configuration files as having disks, and
                 exports file is constructed and given a file name determined
                 by the name of the machine, prefixed with the exports_prefix
                 string.  If a machine is defined as diskless, then no file
                 will be created for it.  The files contain entries for
                 directories on the machine that may be exported to clients.

     -f fstabs_prefix
                 This defines the prefix for the fstab files.  The files will
                 only be created if this prefix is defined.  For each machine
                 defined in the configuration files, a fstab file is created
                 with the file name determined by prefixing this fstabs_prefix
                 string with the name of the machine.  These files contain
                 entries for file systems and partitions to mount at boot
                 time.

     -h hostname
                 Defines the hostname of the destination machine to process
                 for.  If this is not specified, it defaults to the local
                 machine name, as returned by gethostname(3).

     -m automounts_prefix
                 Defines the prefix for the automounter files.  The maps will
                 only be produced if this option is specified.  The mount maps
                 suitable for the network defined by the configuration files
                 will be placed into files with names calculated by prefixing
                 the automounts_prefix string to the name of each map.

     -q          Selects quite mode.  Only error messages that are generated
                 will be displayed.

     -v          Selects verbose mode.  When this is activated, more messages
                 will be displayed, and all information discovered when
                 performing the semantic analysis phase will be displayed.
                 Each verbose message is output to the standard output on a
                 line starting with a `#' character.

     -D name[=string]
                 Defines a symbol name for the preprocessor when reading the
                 configuration files.  Equivalent to the #define directive.

     -I dir      This option is passed into the preprocessor for the
                 configuration files.  It specifies directories in which to
                 find include files.

     -U name     Removes and initial definition of the symbol name.  Inverse
                 of the -D option.

     config      One or more configuration files to be passed as input to
                 fsinfo.

     The fsinfo command is fully described in the document Amd - The 4.4BSD
     Automounter.
