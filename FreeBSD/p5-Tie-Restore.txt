NAME
       Tie::Restore - restores ties to an existing object

DESCRIPTION
       Provides the opposite of the 'tied' function.  Say you have %hash that
       is tied to $object.  Then, it is relatively simple to get $object from
       %hash simply by saying

        $object = tied %hash;

       But, how does one go the other way?  Simple, with Tie::Restore

        tie %hash, 'Tie::Restore', $object;

       Works for any kind of tie. (scalar, array, hash, filehandle)
