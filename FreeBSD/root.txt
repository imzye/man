DESCRIPTION
       This program will add histograms, trees and other objects from a list
       of ROOT files and write them to a target ROOT file. The target file is
       newly created and must not exist, or if -f ("force") is given, must not
       be one of the source files.

OPTIONS
       -a     Append to the output

       -f     Force overwriting of output file

       -f[0-9]
              Gives the ability to specify the compression level of the target
              file.

              Default is 1 (kDefaultZLIB), 0 is uncompressed, 9 is maximum

              compression (see TFile::TFile documentation). You can also
              specify the

              full compresion algorithm, e.g. -f206

       -fk    Sets the target file to contain the baskets with the same
              compression

              as the input files (unless -O is specified). Compresses the meta
              data

              using the compression level specified in the first input or the

              compression setting after fk (for example 206 when using -fk206)

       -ff    The compression level use is the one specified in the first
              input

       -k     Skip corrupt or non-existent files, do not exit

       -L     Read the list of objects from FILE and either only merge or skip
              those

              objects depending on the value of "-Ltype". FILE must contain
              one

              object name per line, which cannot contain whitespaces or '/'.
              You can

              also pass TDirectory names, which apply to the entire directory

              content. Lines beginning with '#' are ignored. If this flag is
              passed,

              "-Ltype" MUST be passed as well.

       -Ltype Sets the type of operation performed on the objects listed in
              FILE

              given with the "-L" flag. "SkipListed" will skip all the listed

              objects; "OnlyListed" will only merge those objects. If this
              flag is

              passed, "-L" must be passed as well.

       -O     Re-optimize basket size when merging TTree

       -T     Do not merge Trees

       -v     Explicitly set the verbosity level: 0 request no output, 99 is
              the

              default

       -j     Parallelize the execution in 'J' processes. If the number of
              processes

              is not specified, use the system maximum.

       -dbg   Enable verbosity. If -j was specified, do not not delete partial
              files

              stored inside working directory.

       -d     Carry out the partial multiprocess execution in the specified

              directory

       -n     Open at most 'N' files at once (use 0 to request to use the
              system

              maximum)

       -cachesize
              Resize the prefetching cache use to speed up I/O operations (use
              0 to

              disable)

       -experimental-io-features
              Used with an argument provided, enables the corresponding
              experimental

              feature for output trees. See ROOT::Experimental::EIOFeatures
