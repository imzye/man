NAME
       Perl4::CoreLibs - libraries historically supplied with Perl 4

DESCRIPTION
       This is a collection of ".pl" files that were bundled with the Perl
       core until core version 5.15.1.  Relying on their presence in the core
       distribution is deprecated; they should be acquired from this CPAN
       distribution instead.  From core version 5.13.3 until their removal,
       the core versions of these libraries emit a deprecation warning when
       loaded.  The CPAN version does not emit such a warning.

       The entire Perl 4 approach to libraries was largely superseded in Perl
       5.000 by the system of module namespaces and ".pm" files.  Most of the
       libraries in this collection predate Perl 5.000, but a handful were
       first introduced in that version.  Functionally, most have been
       directly superseded by modules in the Perl 5 style.  These libraries
       should not be used by new code.  This collection exists to support old
       Perl programs that predate satisfactory replacements.

       Most of these libraries have not been substantially maintained in the
       course of Perl 5 development.  They are now very antiquated in style,
       making no use of the language facilities introduced since Perl 4.  They
       should therefore not be used as programming examples.

LIBRARIES
       The libraries in this collection are:

       abbrev.pl
