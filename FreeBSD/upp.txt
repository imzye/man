THEIDE(1)                           TheIDE                           THEIDE(1)

NAME
       theide ‐ A good integrated development environment, designed for
       developing large C++ applications.

SYNOPSIS
       theide
       theide assembly package
       theide assembly package build_method [-[a] [b] [e] [r] [s] [S] [v] [1]
       [2] [m] [d] [M] [l] [x] [X]] [+FLAG[,FLAG]...] [ out ]

       The first method starts TheIDE with a Package selection dialog, the
       second method directly opens package from assembly and third one allows
       you to build or export specified project according to the supplied
       parameters. The last method does not open TheIde but causes it to work
       in console mode.

DESCRIPTION
       TheIDE is U++ integrated development environment which introduces
       modular concepts to C++ programming. It features BLITZ-build technology
       to speedup C++ rebuilds up to 4 times, visual designers for U++
       libraries, Topic++ system for documenting code and creating rich text
       resources for applications (like help and code documentation) and
       Assist++ ‐ a powerful C++ code analyzer that provides features like
       code completion, navigation and transformation.

       TheIDE integrates with compiler and debugger (by default gcc(1) and
       gdb(1)) and can also be used to develop non-U++ applications.


OPTIONS
       assembly
              Selects in which assembly to look for package. It can be a
              predefined assembly (in .var file) which is in Win32 in
              directory where is located theide.exe or in POSIX systems in
              directories ~, ~/.upp/umk, ~/.upp/theide or ~/.upp/theide.
              Alternatively, it is a direct set of directories that represent
              U++ assembly separated by ','.

       package
              Selects which package to use. The package must exist in selected
              assembly.

       build_method
              Selects build method to be used to build the resulting
              executable, specified either as name of build method (which is
              then searched for in ~, ~/.upp/umk, ~/.upp/theide ~/.upp/theide
              directories) or it is a direct path to the .bm file.

       FLAGs  Specify witch flags should be set up. This works the same way as
              inside TheIDE. The FLAGs must be separated by commas and
              prepended with "+" or ">" character. Please note, that ">" has
              special meaning in most shells and therefore you must either
              escape it or enclose in quotation marks. If flags are not
              specified, the first main configuration entry in .upp file is
              used.

       Parameter options must always form single string, e.g. "-arvs".  Please
       note, that some options are mutually exclusive. Don't use them together
       unless you want to be surprised by the results.

   General options:

              a      Rebuild all. Cleans caches before doing anything.

              b      Use BLITZ.

              e      If building fails, stop with message box.

              l      Be silent.

              v      Be verbose.

              m      Create a map file.

   Output mode:

              r      Release mode.

              1      Release mode ‐ optimize for size.

              2      Release mode ‐ optimize for speed.

              These options are mutually exclusive. If more of them is used
              then last one is used. If none is used, Debug mode is assumed.

   Linking mode:

              s      Use shared libraries.

              S      Use shared libraries and build as shared libraries.

              These options are mutually exclusive. If more of them is used
              then last one is used. If none is specified, static linking is
              used.

   Exporting:

              x      Export files necessary to build project to the directory
                     out

              X      Export all files in project to directory out

              M      Create makefile in file out

              xM,XM  If you mix M with x or X, Makefile is exported to
                     directory out

              k      Do not delete target directory out when exporting.

              Options x and X are mutually exclusive. The last specified is
              used.

FILES
       ~/.upp/theide/*.var
              The assembly specifications.
       ~/.upp/theide/*.bm
              The build methods configurations.
       ~/.upp/theide/theide.cfg
              Main configuration file.
       ~/.upp/theide/ide.colors
              Configuration of colors used in TheIDE.
       ~/.upp/theide/ide.key
              Configuration of key bindings in TheIDE.

       NOTE:  None of these files is meant to be edited by hand. They can be
              created and/or modified from within TheIDE. This is strongly
              recommended since it is easier and safer.

EXAMPLES
       theide examples UWord
              Opens UWord (an example implementation of text proccesor) in
              TheIDE.

       theide examples AddressBook GCC -vasb +GUI,MT /tmp/ab
              Builds application AddressBook with verbose output, using gcc(1)
              in debug mode, with GUI and multithreading support, links it
              using shared libraries and places it in /tmp/ab.

       theide uppsrc ide -2sx +GUI,MT /tmp/ide
              Exports Makefile and all the files needed to build TheIDE itself
              (with speed optimizations) into the directory /tmp/ide/.
