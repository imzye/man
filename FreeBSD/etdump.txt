NAME
     etdump – Dump El Torito boot catalog information from ISO images

SYNOPSIS
     etdump [-f format] [-o file] file ...

DESCRIPTION
     This program reads El Torito boot catalog information from an ISO image
     and outputs it in various formats.  It can be used to check the catalog
     in an image or to output catalog data in a format that can be used by
     other tools such as shell scripts.

     Supported options are:

     -f format --format format
           Select the output format.  Supported output formats are:

                 text   Human-readable text (default)

                 shell  Each boot entry is emitted as a string suitable for
                        passing to a sh-compatible eval command.  The
                        variables emitted are:

                              et_platform  The platform ID from the section
                                           header.  Set to 'default' for the
                                           initial (default) entry.

                              et_system    The system ID from the boot entry.

                              et_lba       The starting LBA (2048-byte blocks)
                                           of the boot image.

                              et_sectors   The number of sectors (512-byte
                                           sectors) that comprise the boot
                                           image.

     -o file --output file
           Write output to file.  If '-' is specified then standard out is
           used.

EXAMPLES
     To see what entries are in a given boot catalog run etdump passing the
     filename of the image as an argument like so:

           % etdump bootonly.iso
           Image in bootonly.iso
           Default entry
                   System i386
                   Start LBA 420 (0x1a4), sector count 4 (0x4)
                   Media type: no emulation

           Section header: efi, final
                   Section entry
                           System i386
                           Start LBA 20 (0x14), sector count 1600 (0x640)
                           Media type: no emulation

     To use the output in a shell script a for loop can be used to iterate
     over the entries returned using eval:

           for entry in `etdump --format shell bootonly.iso`; do
                   eval $entry
                   echo $et_platform $et_system $et_lba $et_sectors
           done

HISTORY
     The etdump utility first appeared in FreeBSD 11.2
