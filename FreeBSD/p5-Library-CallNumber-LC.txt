NAME
       Library::CallNumber::LC - Deal with Library-of-Congress call numbers

VERSION
       Version 0.23;

SYNOPSIS
       Utility functions to deal with Library of Congress Call Numbers

           use Library::CallNumber::LC;
           my $a = Library::CallNumber::LC->new('A 123.4 .c11');
           print $a->normalize; # normalizes for string comparisons.
           # gives 'A01234 C11'
           print $a->start_of_range; # same as "normalize"
           my $b = Library::CallNumber::LC->new('B11 .c13 .d11');
           print $b->normalize;
           # gives 'B0011 C13 D11'
           my @range = ($a->start_of_range, $b->end_of_range);
           # end of range is 'B0011 C13 D11~'

           # Get components suitable for printing (e.g., number and decimal joined, leading dot on first cutter)
           @comps = Library::CallNumber::LC->new('A 123.4 .c11')->components()

           # Same thing, but return empty strings for missing components (e.g., the cutters)
           @comps = Library::CallNumber::LC->new('A 123.4 .c11')->components('true');

ABSTRACT
       Library::CallNumber::LC is mostly designed to do call number
       normalization, with the following goals:

       •   The normalized call numbers are comparable with each other, for
           proper sorting

       •   The normalized call number is a short as possible, so left-anchored
           wildcard searches are possible (e.g., searching on "A11*" should
           give you all the A11 call numbers)

       •   A range defined by start_of_range and end_of_range should be
           correct, assuming that the string given for the end of the range
           is, in fact, a left prefix.

       That last point needs some explanation. The idea is that if someone
       gives a range of, say, A-AZ, what they really mean is A - AZ9999.99.
       The end_of_range method generates a key which lies immediately beyond
       the last possible key for a given starting point. There is no attempt
       to make end_of_range normalization correspond to anything in real life.

CONSTRUCTORS
   new([call_number_text, [topper_character, [bottomer_character]]]) -- create
       a new object, optionally passing in the initial string, a "topper", and
       a "bottomer" (explained below)

BASIC ACCESSORS
   call_number([call_number_text])
       The text of the call number we are dealing with.

   topper([character])
       Specify which character occupies the 'always-sort-to-the-top' slots in
       the sort keys.  Defaults to the SPACE character, but can reasonably be
       anything with an ASCII value lower than 48 (i.e. the 'zero' character,
       '0').  This can function as either a class or instance method depending
       on need.

   bottomer([character])
       Specify which character occupies the 'always-sort-to-the-bottom' slots
       in the sort keys.  Defaults to the TILDE character, but can reasonably
       be anything with an ASCII value higher than 90 (i.e. 'Z').  This can
       function as either a class or instance method depending on need.

OTHER METHODS
   components(boolean returnAll = false)
         @comps = Library::CallNumber::LC->new('A 123.4 .c11')->components($returnAll)

       Returns an array of the individual components of the call number (or
       undef if it doesn't look like a call number).  Components are:

       •   alpha

       •   number (numeric.decimal)

       •   cutter1

       •   cutter2

       •   cutter3

       •   "extra" (anything after the cutters)

       The optional argument <I returnAll> (false by default) determines
       whether or not empty components (e.g., extra cutters) get a slot in the
       returned list.

   _normalize(call_number_text)
       Base function to perform normalization.

   normalize([call_number_text])
       Normalize the stored or passed call number as a sortable string

   start_of_range([call_number_text])
       Alias for normalize

   end_of_range([call_number_text])
       Downshift an lc number so it represents the end of a range

   toLongInt(call_number_text, num_digits)
       Attempt to turn a call number into an integer value. Possibly useful
       for fast range checks, although obviously not perfectly accurate.
       Optional argument $num_digits can be used to control the number of
       digits used, and therefore the precision of the results.
