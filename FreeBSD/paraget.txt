NAME
       paraget - parallel file get

SYNOPSIS
         paraget [options] --mirror-set name filepath

EXAMPLES
         paraget --mirror-set cpan modules/by-module/XML/XML-Parser-2.29.tar.gz

DESCRIPTION
       paraget implements getting a single file in parallel from different
       mirror sites.

       The first time you run paraget, it will download a list of mirrors for
       various mirror-sets, such as CPAN and Debian from paraget's anonymous
       FTP space.

ARGUMENTS
       filepath
           Path to a file underneath the root of a mirrored tree.

       --mirror-set name
           Name of a mirror set.  See ".paraget/mirror-sets/"" in "~ for more
           information.

OPTIONS
       --size filesize
           In order to eliminate the step of determining the filesize of the
           file to retrieve, one can pass it in as an argument.  This is most
           likely to be used if paraget is called in an automated fashion.

       --tmpdir directory
           Use directory for temporary files.  Falls back to $TMPDIR, then
           /tmp.

PERFORMANCE TIPS
       In order to use the best mirrors for you, you should remove what you
       think are probably bad mirrors in your mirror-sets-files, those in
       ~/.paraget/mirror-sets/.

HEURISTIC
       Currently, the heuristic paraget uses to choose how to assign servers
       to intervals is done by assigning the fastest server to the interval
       that is taking the longest to complete.

FILES
       ~/.paraget/mirror-sets/
           The default directory for finding mirror sets.  Underneath this
           should be files named as mirror sets, which each file containing a
           list of URL's that are mirrors for a particular tree.  Lines can be
           commented out using hash-marks (#).

   Examples
       This could be for CPAN: ~/.paraget/mirror-sets/cpan:

         ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN
         ftp://download.sourceforge.net/pub/mirrors/CPAN

TODO
   Persistent statistics
       Implement persistent records-keeping, so that the speed of servers is
       remembered across sessions.  Perhaps this could be offered as an
       online-service, so that each paraget install would not have to learn it
       on its own.

   Heuristic tweaking/modularity
       The heuristics that paraget uses are very hokey.

   HTTP support
       Currently, only FTP is supported; HTTP supports GET's with a file
       offset, so we should be able to add this easily.

KNOWN BUGS
       Intervals sometimes have negative intervals; parget dies horribly.

       Sometimes doesn't complete getting a file; stalls near the end.  Just
       give up and kill paraget.  We're very sorry.

       Currently, we leave a dirty mess in the temporary directory.  This
       could be used if we implemented re-getting of files, but since we
       don't, we should clean up after ourselves.
