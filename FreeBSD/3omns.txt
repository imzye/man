NAME
       3omns - simple tile-based bomb-dropping deathmatch game

SYNOPSIS
       3omns [OPTIONS...]

DESCRIPTION
       3omns is an old-school arcade-style tile-based bomb-dropping deathmatch
       game. The name is a bastardization of the word Bombs (and you should
       pronounce it however you want).

       The red player uses the arrow keys to move and R-Ctrl to drop bombs.
       The blue player uses WASD to move and L-Ctrl to drop bombs. Damage
       players (and destroy crates) by catching them in a bomb blast or
       “punching” them by walking into them. You can disarm opponent bombs by
       walking over them. A few crates contain powerups that briefly make you
       invulnerable.

       3omns supports play over a LAN using the --serve or --connect options
       (see Network Play Options below).

OPTIONS
       -g, --game=MOD
           Normally, 3omns looks for game logic Lua code in RES/base. Specify
           an alternative to base in MOD to run different game logic (a mod,
           if you will). The mod must provide the file RES/MOD/init.lua.

       -r, --resources=RES
           Normally, 3omns looks for its resources somewhere like
           /usr/share/3omns (see 3omns --default-resources for the actual
           location). Specify an alternative in RES.

   Network Play Options
       -c, --connect=SERVER
           Run as a client and connect to the hosting SERVER.

       -p, --port=PORT
           Port to use when serving or connecting. Unless specified, 3omns
           uses port 30325 (which looks kind of like 3OMNS if you tilt your
           head).

       -s, --serve[=LISTEN]
           Run as a host and listen on the given LISTEN address. If not
           specified, LISTEN defaults to the wildcard address.

   Debug Options
       -d, --debug
           Some useful diagnostic information is printed as 3omns runs, and if
           a Lua error is encountered, you are dropped into a Lua debug
           session. You can also enter a Lua debug session at any time by
           pressing the ` (grave accent/tilde) key.

       -n, --debug-network
           Print all network communication as it happens.

   Informational Options
       -R, --default-resources
           Print the default value of RES, the path where 3omns normally looks
           for its resources, and exit. This just provides an unambiguous way
           to find the path without parsing the help text.

       -?, --help
           Print a brief command line help listing and exit.

       --usage
           Print a terse command line usage summary and exit.

       -V, --version
           Print 3omns version and exit.

BUGS
       3omns is still in alpha. These are some of the major deficiencies in
       the current version:

       •   Limited to 2 human players and 2 bots

       •   Bot AI isn’t very good

       •   In LAN play, all connected computers can control both human players

       •   Sometimes in LAN play clients won’t see bomb explosions
