XROBOTS(6)                   FreeBSD Games Manual                   XROBOTS(6)

NAME
       xrobots - fight off villainous robots (X Windows)

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/local/bin/xrobots

DESCRIPTION
       As in robots(6), xrobots puts you into a world of evil robots (but in
       an X window, of course).  It's your intellect against the robots, who
       have numbers on their side.  Fortunately for you, these robots have a
       bad habit of crashing into each other, destroying themselves and
       temporarily improving your chances of survival.

       You have a the following abilities:

              You can move one square at a time (but so can the robots).  The
              direction of possible moves are indicated by the dots near your
              man and by the shape of the cursor.  Clicking the left mouse
              button selects the direction.

              You can wait for robots to reach you.  Do this by clicking on
              the button labeled "Wait" below the main playfield or by
              pressing 'w' while the mouse pointer is within the playfield.

              You can use your teleportation device.  This defensive weapon is
              not without risk.  This can be invoked by clicking on "Teleport"
              or by pressing 't'.

              You have a "sonic screwdriver" which wipes out any robots within
              close proximity.  This offensive weapon recharges once for each
              level.  This can be invoked by the "Sonic Screwdiver" button or
              by pressing 's'.

              The default keyboard setup is similar to the original robots:

                     h      move one square left

                     l      move one square right

                     k      move one square up

                     j      move one square down

                     y      move one square up and left

                     u      move one square up and right

                     b      move one square down and left

                     n      move one square down and right

                     .      (also space) do nothing for one turn

                     HJKLBNYU
                            run as far as possible in the given direction t
                            teleport to a random location

                     w      wait until they reach you

                     s      use your sonic screwdriver

                     control-C is quit

RESOURCES
       If you don't like 's' for the sonic screwdriver and 't' for teleport
       you can change this.  xrobots is programmed using the X Toolkit and
       takes advantage of the toolkit's resources and translation schemes.
       The following are resources that are used by xrobots and should
       probably be set in your .Xdefaults file.

              xrobots.autoteleport
                     If set to true, you teleport automatically when there is
                     no other option.  This does not autoteleport if the sonic
                     screwdriver has not been used.  The default is false.

              xrobots.autoteleportalways
                     This is similar to autoteleport, but teleports
                     automatically even if you have a sonic screwdriver
                     available.  The default is false.

              xrobots.diewaiting
                     Setting this to true adds a little risk to your life and
                     makes the game play a little more like BSD robots.  The
                     default is false.

              xrobots.scorefile
                     Set this to the path of your personal score file.  The
                     file will be created if it does not exist.  The default:
                     /usr/local/lib/X11/xrobots_scores

              xrobots.showmovement
                     If set to false, intermediate movements will not be
                     shown.  This may be useable for very slow servers or very
                     fast players.  The default is true.

              xrobots.spiffy
                     If set to false, some of the graphics will not be shown.
                     This is helpful for slow servers.  The default is true.

       Additionally, all the key bindings can be changed.  Here's a sample set
       of translation bindings that you can modify to your preferences:

              xrobots*Translations:   #augment     \n\
                     <Btn1Up>:    move()             \n\
                     :<Key>u:     move(right, up)    \n\
                     :<Key>l:     move(right)        \n\
                     :<Key>n:     move(right, down)  \n\
                     :<Key>y:     move(left, up)     \n\
                     :<Key>h:     move(left)         \n\
                     :<Key>b:     move(left, down)   \n\
                     :<Key>k:     move(up)           \n\
                     :<Key>j:     move(down)         \n\
                     :<Key>U:     jump(right, up)    \n\
                     :<Key>L:     jump(right)        \n\
                     :<Key>N:     jump(right, down)  \n\
                     :<Key>Y:     jump(left, up)     \n\
                     :<Key>H:     jump(left)         \n\
                     :<Key>B:     jump(left, down)   \n\
                     :<Key>K:     jump(up)           \n\
                     :<Key>J:     jump(down)         \n\
                     <Key>.:      move(nowhere)      \n\
                     <Key>\\ :    move(nowhere)      \n\
                     <Btn2Up>:    go_here()          \n\
                     <Btn3Up>:    wait()             \n\
                     <Key>s:      sonic()            \n\
                     <Key>t:      teleport()         \n\
                     <Key>w:      wait()             \n\
                     <Key>z:      new_game()         \n\
                     Ctrl<Key>c:  quit()

ACTIONS
       Here's what each action that can be referenced via translations is and
       what it does:

              The move() action with no parameters uses the relative position
              of the mouse pointer to determine the direction in which to go.
              Otherwise, a combination of "left", "right", "up", "down", and
              "nowhere" will direct the direction.  If "nowhere" is used, the
              player's icon will remain still while the robots take their
              turn.

              The jump() action does the same thing as move(), except it
              causes the player to move in a direction until it can't go any
              farther.  This is used in the default translations when a key is
              shifted.

              The go_here() action directs the player's icon to the location
              where the mouse button was released.  Of course, the robots will
              chase you, and if doom is impending, go_here() will stop.

              The wait() action causes the robots to move until they are
              breathing right down your neck.

              The sonic() action invokes the sonic screwdriver.

              The teleport() action invokes the teleportation device.

              The new_game() and quit() actions do what you would expect them
              to.

OPTIONS
       In addition to the normal XToolkit options, xrobots accepts command
       line options for the following resources: spiffy, autoteleport,
       autoteleportalways, showmovement, diewaiting, and scorefile.  These
       correspond to the resources as described above.

              For example: xrobots -scorefile myscorefile

SCORING
       Each robot that is wasted is worth ten points.  Additionally, bonuses
       are awarded for each teleportation, and for not using the sonic
       screwdriver.  The name for the high score list comes from the USER
       environment variable.

FILES
       /usr/local/lib/X11/xrobots_scores -- the score file

AUTHOR
       There are many versions of robots floating around.  So many that it
       would be difficult to say who the original author is.  This version was
       written from scratch by Brian Warkentine (brianw@Sun.COM).
