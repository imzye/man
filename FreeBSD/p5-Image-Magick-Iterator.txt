Image::Magick::Iterator(3)                 User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Image::Magick::Iterator - sequentially read Image::Magick object from a
       filehandle.

SYNOPSIS
         use strict;
         use Image::Magick::Iterator;

         my $iter = Image::Magick::Iterator->new();

         #assume PPM stream is coming from STDIN;
         $iter->handle(\*STDIN);

         #explicitly set format to PPM, there is no auto-detection built in
         $iter->format('PPM');

         while(my $image = $iter->next){
           print $image->Get('height'),"\n"; #access height attribute of each
                                             #Image::Magick object
         }

DESCRIPTION
       Image::Magick::Iterator adds iteration support to Image::Magick.  This
       means that if you have a stream of concatenated images, you can access
       each image in the stream as an independent Image::Magick object.

       Iteration functionality is not present in Image::Magick itself as of
       version 5.56.  Passing a stream of concatenated images would result in
       essentially a "stack" of images which would all be manipulated in
       parallel by any Image::Magick calls.  Calls to Write() either output an
       animated series of image (a la animated GIFs), or the first image in
       the series.

       Image::Magick::Iterator is extensible to support many different image
       filetypes.  Currently only PPM support is implemented.  See /SYNOPSIS
       for an example.

SUPPORTED FORMATS
       Currently only PPM images can be iterated.  It's not difficult to add
       new image types though, and I'm receptive to new classes for handling
       more formats.  To add another format:

       1. Have a look at the source of Image::Magick::Iterator::PPM to get an
       idea of how to write a new format handling class.  It is basically a
       class with one method, read_image, that when given a filehandle
       reference reads an image from it and passes back the raw data.

       2. add a mapping to "_delegate()" that maps the desired value of
       "format()" to your image reading class.

APPENDIX
       The rest of the documentation details each of the object methods.
       Internal methods are usually preceded with a '_'.  Methods are in
       alphabetical order for the most part.

   new()
       Usage
             my $obj = new Image::Magick::Iterator();

       Function
           Builds a new Image::Magick::Iterator object

       Returns
           an instance of Image::Magick::Iterator

       Arguments
           None

   init()
       Usage
             $obj->init(%arg);

       Function
           Internal method to initialize a new Image::Magick::Iterator object

       Returns
           true on success

       Arguments
           Arguments passed to "new()"

   format()
       Usage
             $obj->format();        #get existing value

             $obj->format($newval); #set new value

       Function
           stores a scalar value of the fileformat to be read from "handle()".
           currently supported formats are:

             * PPM

       Returns
           value of format (a scalar)

       Arguments
           (optional) on set, a scalar

   handle()
       Usage
             $obj->handle();        #get existing value

             $obj->handle($newval); #set new value

       Function
           stores a filehandle reference (eg \*STDIN, or an IO::Handle.

       Returns
           value of handle (a scalar)

       Arguments
           (optional) on set, a scalar

   next()
       Usage
             $obj->next(); #get next Image::Magick from stream

       Function
           reads an Image::Magick object from a filehandle.

       Returns
           a Image::Magick object, or undef if the filehandle is EOF or
           contains only a partial image.

       Arguments
           none, read-only

   _delegate()
       Usage
             $obj->_delegate($format);

       Function
           internal method, maps format names to class names

       Returns
           class to be delegated to for reading an image of the specified
           format

       Arguments
           name of an image format
