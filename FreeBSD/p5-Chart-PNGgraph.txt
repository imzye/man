NAME
       Chart::PNGgraph - Graph Plotting Module (deprecated)

SYNOPSIS
       use Chart::PNGgraph::moduleName;

DESCRIPTION
       Chart::PNGgraph is a perl5 module to create PNG output for a graph.

       Chart::PNGgraph is nothing more than a wrapper around GD::Graph, and
       its use is deprecated. It only exists for backward compatibility. The
       documentation for all the functionality can be found in GD::Graph.

       This module should work with all versions of GD, but it has only been
       tested with version 1.19 and above. Version 1.19 is the last version
       that produces GIF output, and requires a conversion step. The default
       distribution of Chart::PNGgraph uses Image::Magick for this. If you'd
       like to use something else, please replace the sub png2gif in
       Chart::PNGgraph::Convert with something more to your liking.

NOTES
       Note that if you use Chart::PNGgraph with a GD version 1.19 or lower
       that any included logos will have to be in the GIF format. The only
       time that PNG comes into play is _after_ GD has done its work, and the
       GIF gets converted to PNG. There are no plans to change that behaviour;
       it's too much work, and you should really be upgrading to a version of
       GD that produces PNG directly.
