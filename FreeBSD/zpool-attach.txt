ZPOOL-ATTACH(8)         FreeBSD System Manager's Manual        ZPOOL-ATTACH(8)

NAME
     zpool-attach – attach new device to existing ZFS vdev

SYNOPSIS
     zpool attach [-fsw] [-o property=value] pool device new_device

DESCRIPTION
     Attaches new_device to the existing device.  The existing device cannot
     be part of a raidz configuration.  If device is not currently part of a
     mirrored configuration, device automatically transforms into a two-way
     mirror of device and new_device.  If device is part of a two-way mirror,
     attaching new_device creates a three-way mirror, and so on.  In either
     case, new_device begins to resilver immediately and any running scrub is
     cancelled.

     -f      Forces use of new_device, even if it appears to be in use.  Not
             all devices can be overridden in this manner.

     -o property=value
             Sets the given pool properties.  See the zpoolprops(7) manual
             page for a list of valid properties that can be set.  The only
             property supported at the moment is ashift.

     -s      The new_device is reconstructed sequentially to restore
             redundancy as quickly as possible.  Checksums are not verified
             during sequential reconstruction so a scrub is started when the
             resilver completes.  Sequential reconstruction is not supported
             for raidz configurations.

     -w      Waits until new_device has finished resilvering before returning.
