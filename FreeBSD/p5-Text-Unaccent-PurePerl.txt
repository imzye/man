Text::Unaccent::PurePerl(3)                User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Text::Unaccent::PurePerl - remove accents from characters

SYNOPSIS
         use Text::Unaccent::PurePerl qw(unac_string);

         $unaccented = unac_string($string);

         # For compatibility with Text::Unaccent, and
         # for dealing with strings of raw octets:

         $unaccented = unac_string($charset, $octets);
         $unaccented = unac_string_utf16($octets);

         # For compatibility with Text::Unaccent, but
         # have no useful purpose in this module.
         $version = unac_version();
         unac_debug($level);

DESCRIPTION
   Conversions
       Text::Unaccent::PurePerl is a module for “unaccenting” characters,
       i.e., removing accents and other diacritic marks from characters. Here,
       the term unaccenting has a rather loose meaning, since this module does
       a lot more than just removing accents. Here are some examples:

         Á → A    latin letter
         Æ → AE   single letter split in two
         ƒ → f    simpler variant of same letter
         Ĳ → IJ   ligature split in two
         ¹ → 1    superscript
         ½ → 1⁄2  fraction
         ώ → ω    Greek letter
         Й → И    Cyrillic letter
         ™ → TM   various symbols

   Comparison to Text::Unaccent
       Text::Unaccent::PurePerl is a pure Perl equivalent to the
       Text::Unaccent module, but with the additional feature of handling
       modern Perl character strings. Text::Unaccent only deals with raw octet
       strings with an associated character coding. In addition, this module,
       as the name suggests, does not require a C compiler to build. The
       disadvantage is that this module is slower than Text::Unaccent.

   Other conversions
       The conversions done by Text::Unaccent seem inconsistent. For instance,

         Æ → AE   Text::Unaccent will convert this ...
         Œ → OE   ... but not this

       One might expect the following conversions

         … → ...  U+2026 HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS
         Œ → OE   U+0152 LATIN CAPITAL LIGATURE OE
         œ → oe   U+0153 LATIN SMALL LIGATURE OE
         ′ → '    U+2032 PRIME
         ″ → "    U+2033 DOUBLE PRIME

       and more, but these aren't implemented in Text::Unaccent, so they
       aren't implemented in Text::Unaccent::PurePerl either. This might
       change in the future.

   Comparison to Text::Unidecode
       If you want a full transliteration to ASCII, use the Text::Unidecode
       module.

         "Русский" (input)
         "Русскии" (output from Text::Unaccent::PurePerl::unac_string)
         "Russkii" (output from Text::Unidecode::unidecode)

         "Ελληνικά" (input)
         "Ελληνικα" (output from Text::Unaccent::PurePerl::unac_string)
         "Ellinika" (output from Text::Unidecode::unidecode)

EXPORT
       Functions exported by default: "unac_string", "unac_string_utf16",
       "unac_version", and "unac_debug".

FUNCTIONS
       unac_string CHARACTER_STRING
       unac_string ENCODING, OCTET_STRING
           Return the unaccented equivalent to the input string. The one-
           argument version assumes the input is a Perl string, i.e., a
           sequence of characters. (A character is in the range 0...(2**32-1),
           or more).

           The two-argument version assumes the input is a sequence of octets,
           i.e., raw, encoded data. (An octet is eight bits of data with
           ordinal value in the range 0...255.) It is essentially equivalent
           to the following unaccent() function

             use Text::Unaccent;
             use Encode;

             sub unaccent {
                 ($enc, $oct) = @_;
                 encode($enc, unac_string(decode($enc, $oct)));
             }

       unac_string_utf16 OCTET_STRING
           This function is mainly provided for compatibility with
           Text::Unaccent. It is equivalent to

               unac_string("UTF-16BE", OCTET_STRING);

       unac_version
           This function is provided only for compatibility with
           Text::Unaccent. It returns the version of this module.

       unac_debug LEVEL
           This function is provided only for compatibility with
           Text::Unaccent. It has no effect on the behaviour of this module.

EXAMPLES
   French
         $str1 = "déjà vu";
         $str2 = unac_string($str1);
         #     = "deja vu";

   Greek
         $str1 = "νέα";
               = "\x{03BD}\x{03AD}\x{03B1}";

         $str2 = unac_string($str1);
         #     = "νεα";
         #     = "\x{03BD}\x{03B5}\x{03B1}";

       The unaccented string $str2 is made up by the three letters epsilon
       (without the tonos), nu, and alpha.

       In contrast, the version of unac_string() in the Text::Unaccent module
       gives

         $oct2 = unac_string("UTF-8", $str1);
         #     = "\xCE\xBD\xCE\xB5\xCE\xB1";

       These octets are the UTF-8 encoded equivalent of
       "\x{03BD}\x{03B5}\x{03B1}".
