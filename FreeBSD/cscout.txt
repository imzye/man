NAME
       cscc - CScout C compiler front end

SYNOPSIS
       cscc [gcc(1) options]

DESCRIPTION
       cscc is a wrapper around gcc.  commands.  When invoked instead of gcc,
       it will compile the specified file(s) in the same way as gcc would do.
       As a side-effect it will monitor the invocation of gcc(1) and record
       its environment and arguments.  With those data it will generate a
       CScout project specification that can be used to process the file(s)
       that were compiled.  The project specification is saved into a file
       named make.cs.

EXAMPLE
       The following commands are often the only ones required to process a
       few C files.

       cscc example.c
       cscout make.cs

       If you want to use cscc with another C compiler, prepend CC=compiler-
       name to the cscc invocation, as shown in the following example.

       CC=x86_64-w64-gcc cscc
