DESCRIPTION
     The mmg2d application is dedicated to bidimensional triangular mesh
     remeshing.

     By default it performs mesh modifications in order to control the surface
     approximation.
     Providing a metric file, it adapts the mesh to the prescribed sizes at
     nodes.
     Without metric file, the -optim option allows to improve the mesh quality
     with respect to the initial mesh size.
     Providing a level-set file containing the values of the level-set
     function at the mesh nodes, the -ls option allows to explicitely mesh an
     implicit domain and the -lssurf option splits mesh boundaries on a
     provided isovalue.
     Providing a displacement file -lag option applies a lagrangian
     displacement to boundary mesh nodes.
