SOCKSTAT(1)             FreeBSD General Commands Manual            SOCKSTAT(1)

NAME
     sockstat – list open sockets

SYNOPSIS
     sockstat [-46cLlSsUuvw] [-j jid] [-p ports] [-P protocols]

DESCRIPTION
     The sockstat command lists open Internet or UNIX domain sockets.

     The following options are available:

     -4          Show AF_INET (IPv4) sockets.

     -6          Show AF_INET6 (IPv6) sockets.

     -c          Show connected sockets.

     -j jail     Show only sockets belonging to the specified jail ID or name.

     -L          Only show Internet sockets if the local and foreign addresses
                 are not in the loopback network prefix 127.0.0.0/8, or do not
                 contain the IPv6 loopback address ::1.

     -l          Show listening sockets.

     -p ports    Only show Internet sockets if the local or foreign port
                 number is on the specified list.  The ports argument is a
                 comma-separated list of port numbers and ranges specified as
                 first and last port separated by a dash.

     -P protocols
                 Only show sockets of the specified protocols.  The protocols
                 argument is a comma-separated list of protocol names, as they
                 are defined in protocols(5).

     -q          Quiet mode, do not print the header line.

     -S          Display the protocol stack, if applicable.  This is currently
                 only implemented for TCP.

     -s          Display the protocol state, if applicable.  This is currently
                 only implemented for SCTP and TCP.

     -U          Display the remote UDP encapsulation port number, if
                 applicable.  This is currently only implemented for SCTP.

     -u          Show AF_LOCAL (UNIX) sockets.

     -v          Verbose mode.

     -w          Use wider field size for displaying addresses.

     If neither -4, -6 or -u is specified, sockstat will list sockets in all
     three domains.

     If neither -c or -l is specified, sockstat will list both listening and
     connected sockets.

     The information listed for each socket is:

     USER             The user who owns the socket.

     COMMAND          The command which holds the socket.

     PID              The process ID of the command which holds the socket.

     FD               The file descriptor number of the socket.

     PROTO            The transport protocol associated with the socket for
                      Internet sockets, or the type of socket (stream,
                      datagram, or seqpacket) for UNIX sockets.

     LOCAL ADDRESS    For Internet sockets, this is the address the local end
                      of the socket is bound to (see getsockname(2)).  For
                      bound UNIX sockets, it is the socket's filename.  For
                      other UNIX sockets, it is a right arrow followed by the
                      endpoint's filename, or “??” if the endpoint could not
                      be determined.

     FOREIGN ADDRESS  (Internet sockets only) The address the foreign end of
                      the socket is bound to (see getpeername(2)).

     ENCAPS           The remote UDP encapsulation port number if -U is
                      specified (only for SCTP).

     PATH STATE       The path state if -s is specified (only for SCTP).

     CONN STATE       The connection state if -s is specified (only for SCTP
                      or TCP).

     STACK            The protocol stack if -S is specified (only for TCP).

     If a socket is associated with more than one file descriptor, it is shown
     multiple times.  If a socket is not associated with any file descriptor,
     the first four columns have no meaning.
