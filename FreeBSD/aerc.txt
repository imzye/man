AERC-SEARCH(1)          FreeBSD General Commands Manual         AERC-SEARCH(1)

NAME
       aerc-search - search and filter patterns and options for aerc(1)

SYNTAX
       This syntax is common to all backends.

       :filter [-rubae] [-x <flag>] [-X <flag>] [-H <header>:[<value>]] [-f
       <from>] [-t <to>] [-c <cc>] [-d <start[..end]>] [<terms>...]
       :search [-rubae] [-x <flag>] [-X <flag>] [-H <header>:[<value>]] [-f
       <from>] [-t <to>] [-c <cc>] [-d <start[..end]>] [<terms>...]
           Searches the current folder for messages matching the given set of
           conditions.

           :filter restricts the displayed messages to only the search
           results.

           Each space separated term of <terms>, if provided, is searched
           case-insensitively among subject lines unless -b or -a are
           provided.

           -r: Search for read messages

           -u: Search for unread messages

           -x <flag>, -X <flag>: Restrict search to messages with or without
           <flag>
               Use -x to search for messages with the flag set. Use -X to
               search for messages without the flag set.

               Possible values are:
                   Seen
                       Read messages
                   Answered
                       Replied messages
                   Forwarded
                       Forwarded messages
                   Flagged
                       Flagged messages
                   Draft
                       Draft messages

           -H <header>:[<value>]:
               Search in the headers of the messages for a specific <header>
               that matches <value>, <value> can be omitted to only search for
               a <header>. If either the <header> or the <value> contain a
               space then the whole argument needs to be escaped with quotes,
               note: spaces around <value> are trimmed.

           -b: Search in the body of the messages

           -a: Search in the entire text of the messages

           -e: Instruct the backend to use a custom search extension
               (such as X-GM-EXT-1 if available). Search terms are expected in
               <terms>; other flags will be ignored.

           -f <from>: Search for messages from <from>

           -t <to>: Search for messages to <to>

           -c <cc>: Search for messages cc'ed to <cc>

           -d <since[..until]>:
               Search for messages within a particular date range between
               since and until, excluding the latter (in mathematical
               notation: search for messages in the [since, until) interval).
               until can be omitted to only search for <since> to present.

               Spaces and underscores are allowed in relative dates to improve
               readability.

               YYYY-MM-DD

               today, yesterday

               (this|last) (year|month|week)

               Weekdays, Monthnames
                   Can also be abbreviated, so Monday..Tuesday can be written
                   as Mon..Tue and February..March as Feb..Mar.

               <N> (y[ear]|m[onth]|w[eek]|d[ay])
                   <N> is a positive integer that represents the number of
                   time units in the past. Multiple relative terms can be
                   accumulated. The units can also be abbreviated by a single
                   letter such that yesterday would correspond to 1d
                   (equivalent to 1 day or 1_day) and 8 days ago would be
                   either 1w1d or 8d.

CUSTOM IMAP EXTENSIONS
       The Gmail IMAP extension (X-GM-EXT-1) can be used for searching and
       filtering. To use this custom extension, make sure it is activated (see
       aerc-imap(5)) and use the extension -e flag in your :filter or :search
       commands.

           Example:

               :filter -e filename:pdf from:bob :filter -e has:attachment
               newer_than:2d

               :search -e is:read is:starred :search -e list:~rjarry/aerc-
               devel@lists.sr.ht

NOTMUCH
       For notmuch, it is possible to avoid using the above flags and only
       rely on notmuch search syntax.

       :filter query...
       :search query...
           You can use the full notmuch query language as described in
           notmuch-search-terms(7).

           The query will only apply on top of the active folder query.

           Example, jump to next unread:

               :search tag:unread
