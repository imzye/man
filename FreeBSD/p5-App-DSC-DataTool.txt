NAME
       dsc-datatool - Export DSC data into various formats and databases

SYNOPSIS
       dsc-datatool --server name --node name <--xml|--dat> [options]

DESCRIPTION
       dsc-datatool can be used to read DSC data in the XML and DAT format and
       export it into another format or send it to various databases, use
       --list to see the list of available output plugins.

OPTIONS
       [ -c | --conf ] <file>
               Specify the YAML configuration file to use (default to
               ~/.dsc-datatool.conf), any command line option will override
               the options in the configuration file.  See
               dsc-datatool.conf(5) for more information.

       [ -s | --server ] <name> (required)
               Specify the server for where the data comes from.

       [ -n | --node ] <name> (required)
               Specify the node for where the data comes from.

       [ -x | --xml ] <file or directory> (suggested)
               Read DSC data from the given file or directory, can be
               specified multiple times.  If a directory is given then all
               files ending with .xml will be read.

       [ -d | --dat ] <directory> (suggested)
               Read DSC data from the given directory, can be specified
               multiple times.  Note that the DAT format is depended on the
               filename to know what type of data it is.

       [ -ds | --dataset ] <list of datasets>
               Specify that only the list of datasets will be processed, the
               list is comma separated and the option can be given multiple
               times.

       [ -o | --output ] <sep<type>[<sep>option=value...]>
               Output data to type and use separator as an options separator,
               example:

                 --output ;Carbon;host=localhost;port=2003

               Can be specified multiple times to output to more then one.

               To see a full list of options, check the man-page of the output
               module:

                 man App:DSC::DataTool::Output::NAME

       [ -t | --transform ] <sep<type><sep><datasets>[<sep>option=value...]>
               Use the transformer type to change the list of datasets in
               datasets, example:

                 --transform ;ReRanger;rcode_vs_replylen;type=sum;range=/128

               datasets is a comma separated list of datasets to run the
               tranformer on, because of this do not use comma (,) as a
               separator.  * in datasets will make the tranformer run on all
               datasets.

               Can be specific multiple times to chain transformation, the
               chain will be executed in the order on command line with one
               exception.  All transformations specified for dataset * will be
               executed before named dataset transformations.

               To see a full list of options, check the man-page of the
               transformer module:

                 man App:DSC::DataTool::Transformer::NAME

               For a list of datasets see the DSC configuration that created
               the data files and the documentation for the Presenter.

       [ -g | --generator ] <list of generators>
               Use the specified generators to generate additional datasets,
               the list is comma separated and the option can be given
               multiple times.

       [ -l | --list ]
               List the available inputs, generators, transformers and
               outputs.

       --skipped-key "text"
               Set the special DSC skipped key, default to "-:SKIPPED:-".

       --skipped-sum-key "text"
               Set the special DSC skipped sum key, default to
               "-:SKIPPED_SUM:-".

       -h | --help
               Print a brief help message and exits.
