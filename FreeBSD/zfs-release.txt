ZFS-HOLD(8)             FreeBSD System Manager's Manual            ZFS-HOLD(8)

NAME
     zfs-hold – hold ZFS snapshots to prevent their removal

SYNOPSIS
     zfs hold [-r] tag snapshot…
     zfs holds [-rH] snapshot…
     zfs release [-r] tag snapshot…

DESCRIPTION
     zfs hold [-r] tag snapshot…
       Adds a single reference, named with the tag argument, to the specified
       snapshots.  Each snapshot has its own tag namespace, and tags must be
       unique within that space.

       If a hold exists on a snapshot, attempts to destroy that snapshot by
       using the zfs destroy command return EBUSY.

       -r  Specifies that a hold with the given tag is applied recursively to
           the snapshots of all descendent file systems.

     zfs holds [-rH] snapshot…
       Lists all existing user references for the given snapshot or snapshots.

       -r  Lists the holds that are set on the named descendent snapshots, in
           addition to listing the holds on the named snapshot.

       -H  Do not print headers, use tab-delimited output.

     zfs release [-r] tag snapshot…
       Removes a single reference, named with the tag argument, from the
       specified snapshot or snapshots.  The tag must already exist for each
       snapshot.  If a hold exists on a snapshot, attempts to destroy that
       snapshot by using the zfs destroy command return EBUSY.

       -r  Recursively releases a hold with the given tag on the snapshots of
           all descendent file systems.
