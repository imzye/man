Net::OpenID::Common(3)                     User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Net::OpenID::Common - Libraries shared between Net::OpenID::Consumer
       and Net::OpenID::Server

VERSION
       version 1.20

DESCRIPTION
       The Consumer and Server implementations share a few libraries which
       live with this module. This module is here largely to hold the version
       number and this documentation, though it also incorporates some utility
       functions inherited from previous versions of Net::OpenID::Consumer.
