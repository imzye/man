DRAWTERM(1)             FreeBSD General Commands Manual            DRAWTERM(1)



NAME
       drawterm  - connection to cpu, fs, and auth servers


SYNOPSIS
       drawterm [ -GBO ] [ -h host ] [ -u user ] [ -a authserver ] [ -s
       secstore ] [ -e 'crypt hash' ] [ -k keypattern ] [ -p ] [ -t timeout ]
       [ -r root ] [ -g geometry ] [ -c cmd ...]


DESCRIPTION
       Drawterm is a client for connecting venerable systems to Plan 9
       systems. The standard behavior with no options provided is to begin a
       graphical session which will prompt for a cpu server, auth server, and
       password. If $USER is not set, drawterm will prompt for a username as
       well.

       The goal of drawterm is to provide an abstraction layer from the client
       operating system to the desired Plan 9 system. Client-side devices that
       can be represented as filesystems will be and are served from the
       namespace drawterm operates in. Generally, this means that drawterm
       behaves like a Plan 9 kernel and will attempt to reconstruct a Plan 9
       terminal-like experience from a non-Plan 9 system.


       The options are:


       -G     Start drawterm in text-only mode (no graphics).


       -B     Disable kbdfs.


       -O     Use the old cpu(1) to connect to the cpu server rather than
              rcpu(1).


       -h host
              Connect to host for cpu.


       -u user
              Remote user id.


       -a authserver
              Connect to authserver for auth.


       -s secstore
              Sets the address of the secstore(8) server. If the -s option is
              absent, secstore(1) will attempt to dial tcp!$auth!secstore (or
              the otherwise specified auth server).


       -e 'crypt hash'
              Specifies the 'crypt hash' for the connection. The default is
              'rc4_256 sha1'. Usage of no encryption can be specified by
              'clear' as per
              ssl(3).Notethatthisoptionisdeprecatedandonlyrelevanttotheoutdated
              cpu(1) protocol.


       -k keypattern
              Use keypattern to select a key to authenticate to the remote
              side (see auth(2)).


       -p     Protect the connection against connection resets by establishing
              aan(8) tunnel.


       -t timeout
              Set the timeout for aan(8) to a value in seconds (default is one
              day).


       -r root
              Specifies the root directory on the client. The default is /root
              and all further paths are relative thereto.


       -c cmd ...
              The command to run can be passed with -c cmd ..., otherwise an
              interactive shell is started. The user's profile is run before
              the command with $service set to cpu to allow further
              customization of the environment (see rc(1) for more
              information).


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       USER   Unless otherwise specified, the user stored in $USER is used for
              authentication.


       PASS   If $PASS is set, no password will be prompted for in
              authentication and the contents of $PASS will be used instead.


       cpu    Unless otherwise specified, the address stored in $cpu is used
              for the rcpu(1) connection (if set).


       auth   Unless otherwise specified, the address stored in $auth is used
              for the rcpu(1) connection (if set).


SERVICES
       A number of services are provided in drawterm. The exact functionality
       and availability of certain features may be dependent on your platform
       or architecture:


       /mnt/term
              A mount of the client machine's root filesystem as well as
              certain virtual filesystems to present Plan 9 devices and
              interfaces that are not available on non-Plan 9 systems. On
              Windows this is a directory containing the available lettered
              disks (C:, A:, etc.). Additionally, there is always a
              /mnt/term/root folder which is a copy of the client machine's
              namespace with no virtual filesystems present as to avoid
              conflicting names (such as with Linux's /root).


       #b     Assuming the -B flag is not set, /dev/kbd will be provided for
              kbdfs (see kbd(3)).


       #i     Assuming the -G flag is not set, various drawing device files
              will be provided in /dev (see draw(3)).


       #m     Assuming the -G flag is not set, files for controlling the mouse
              will provided in /dev (see mouse(3)).


       #c     A number of console device files giving access to the console
              screen and miscellaneous information are provided and mounted in
              /dev (see cons(3)).


       #I     The network filesystem is served and bound over /net, providing
              the interface to Internet Protocol stacks (see ip(3)).


       #A     An audio device filesystem is served, if possible, as a one-
              level directory in /dev (see audio(3)).  Note that this device,
              if unable to be served, will not cause a panic in drawterm.


EXAMPLES
       Make a headless rcpu session connecting to 10.30.167.25 using
       plan9.postnix.us as the auth server with aan(8) enabled:

              drawterm -G -h 10.30.167.25 -a plan9.postnix.us -p

       Make a session using cpu rather than rcpu to tenshi.postnix.us; this
       command is the same for connecting to a Plan 9 4th edition system:

              drawterm -O -h tenshi.postnix.us

BUGS
       Drawterm is not a Plan 9 program.


HISTORY
       Drawterm was originally developed by Russ Cox (rsc) for Plan 9 4th
       edition. This original version is still usable on Plan 9 and its forks
       which use the p9sk1 and older authsrv(6) protocols.
       https://swtch.com/drawterm/

       The 9front project has forked drawterm to incorporate features from
       9front, most importantly dp9ik authentication support (see authsrv(6))
       and the TLS-based rcpu(1) protocol.

                                                                   DRAWTERM(1)
