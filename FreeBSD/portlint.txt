PORTLINT(1)             FreeBSD General Commands Manual            PORTLINT(1)

NAME
     portlint – a verifier for port directories

SYNOPSIS
     portlint [-abcghvtACNV] [-M ENV] [-B n] [dir]

DESCRIPTION
     portlint tries to verify the content of a port directory.  The purpose of
     portlint can be separated into two parts: (1) to let the submitters
     easily polish their own port directory, and (2) to decrease the labor of
     the committers.

     portlint uses very simple regular-expression matching for verifying files
     that make up a port directory.  Note that it does NOT implement a
     complete parser for those files.  Because of this the user may see some
     extra warnings, especially when checking complex Makefiles.

     Options

     -a          Perform additional checks for extra files, such as scripts/*
                 and pkg-*.

     -b          Warn the use of $(VARIABLE).  Some of the committers prefer
                 ${VARIABLE} instead of $(VARIABLE), even though they are
                 semantically the same.

     -c          Committer flag.  It will add several checks useful only for
                 committers.  If you are a committer and performing check just
                 before committing a port, use this option.

     -g          Group and consolidate errors so that redundant error messages
                 are rolled up into one line with a list of all affected line
                 numbers (where appropriate).  This option is disabled if -v
                 is specified.

     -h          Show the summary of command line options, then exit.

     -m          Adds checks for $PORTSDIR/MOVED, $PORTSDIR/UIDs, and
                 $PORTSDIR/GIDs.

     -v          Be verbose.  Show the progress report for items that are
                 being checked.

     -t          Nit pick about use of spaces.

     -A          Turn on all additional checks.  This is equivalent to
                 -abcmNt.

     -C          Pedantic committer flag.  This is equivalent to -abcmt.

     -N          New port flag.  Adds several checks specific to newly
                 submitted port.  If you are willing to submit the directory
                 to be checked as a new port, use this option.

     -V          Print the portlint version and exit.

     -M ENV      Set make variables to ENV (ex. PORTSDIR=/usr/ports.work).

     -B n        Set the number of contiguous blank lines allowed in Makefile
                 to n.  (by default, n is 1)

     dir         The port directory to be checked.  If omitted, check will be
                 performed over the current directory.

ENVIRONMENT
     The following environment variables affect the execution of portlint:

     PL_GIT_IGNORE  Set to a Perl-compatible regular expression, of patterns
                    to ignore when checking to see if files are in the git
                    repository.  For example, '^\d+$|^pr-patch$'.

     PORTSDIR       The fully-qualified path to the ports tree.  For example,
                    “/usr/ports”.

FILES
     bsd.port.mk    master Makefile for ports (bsd.pkg.mk on NetBSD / OpenBSD)
     /usr/ports/*   ports collection (/usr/pkgsrc/* on NetBSD / OpenBSD); can
                    be overriden by setting the PORTSDIR environment variable.

DIAGNOSTICS
     Messages will be sent to standard output, not standard error output.

     FATAL: ...    This type of error message suggests that there is some
                   fatal error in the port directory.  For example, if some
                   files need a rewrite, or if some inevitable files are
                   missing, this message will show up.  This kind of errors
                   should be avoided BEFORE submitting a port via send-pr to
                   the committers.

     WARN: ...     This type of error message suggests that some files may (or
                   may not) need some fix.  Basically, warnings are produced
                   when portlint is not completely sure about the result.  For
                   example, complex Makefiles may need some statements that
                   can match the regular expression portlint uses for sanity
                   checks.  In those cases, the user should evaluate the
                   result manually, and obey/ignore the result.

     OK: ...       This types of message is used in verbose mode (-v).
