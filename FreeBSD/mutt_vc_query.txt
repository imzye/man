NAME
     mutt_vc_query – vCard query utility for mutt

SYNOPSIS
     mutt_vc_query [-m | -e] [-t type] [-f datafile] query
     mutt_vc_query [-v]

DESCRIPTION
     A vCard query utility for mutt.  This utility can be used at the shell
     prompt to perform ad-hoc queries, but it is meant to be used by mutt's
     "query_command" option. Place the following line in your "~/.muttrc"
     file:

           set query_command = "mutt_vc_query '%s'"

     The search using the given query string will be case insensitive.  The
     options are as follows:

           -e  Sort the results by email.

           -f  Use the datafile to perform the query.

           -h  Display usage help.

           -m  Sort the results by the miscellaneous field.

           -t  Uses the specified type for the miscellaneous field.

           -v  Display the version.

           -V  Display the copyright and license.

FILES
     ~/.rolo/contacts.vcf  Default data file that mutt_vc_query will query.

EXAMPLES
     To query for the string "Hsu" and have the miscellaneous field be
     populated by the type "NICKNAME":

           mutt_vc_query -t NICKNAME Hsu
