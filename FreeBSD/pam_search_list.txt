NAME
     pam_search_list – search_list PAM module

SYNOPSIS
     [service-name] module-type control-flag pam_search_list [options]

DESCRIPTION
     The search_list service module for PAM, pam_search_list provides
     functionality for only one PAM category: account management.  In terms of
     the module-type parameter, this is the “account” feature.

   Search List Account Management Module
     The search_list account management component (pam_sm_acct_mgmt()),
     succeeds if and only if the user is listed in a file specified by its
     path parameter.

     The following options may be passed to the authentication module:

     debug     syslog(3) debugging information at LOG_DEBUG level.

     no_warn   suppress warning messages to the user.  These messages include
               reasons why the user's authentication attempt was declined.

     path=filename
               path to file to search for username. If file is not readable,
               error is logged and user is considered to be not found.
               Required parameter.

     disallow  reverse the semantics; pam_search_list will succeed if and only
               if the user is not listed in filename specified by path
               parameter.

     allow_root
               do not automatically fail if the target user's UID is 0.
