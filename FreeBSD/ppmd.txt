NAME
       ppmd - file-to-file compressor

SYNTAX
       ppmd <e|d> [switches] <FileName[s] | Wildcard[s]>

DESCRIPTION
       PPMD is written for embedding in user programs mainly and it is not
       intended for immediate use. The author was interested in speed and
       performance improvements of abstract PPM model [1-6] only, without
       tuning it to particular data types, therefore compressor works good
       enough for texts, but it is not so good for nonhomogeneous files
       (executables) and for noisy analog data (sounds, pictures etc.).
       Program is very memory consuming, you can choose balance between
       execution speed and memory economy, on one hand, and compression
       performance, on another hand, with the help of model order selection
       option (-o).


OPTIONS
       -d <delete file[s] after processing, default: disabled>

       -s <silent>

       -fName <set output file name to Name>

       -mN <use N MB memory - [1,256], default: 10> The PPMII algorithm
              might need a lot of memory, especially when used on large files
              and/or used with large model order. If ppmd needs more memory
              than you give it, the compression will be worse. The exact
              effect is dependent on the -r option.

       -oN <set model order to N - [2,16], default: 4> Bigger model
              orders almost surely results in better compression and surely
              more memory and CPU usage.

       -r{0,1,2} <>
              Methods of restoration of model correctness at memory
              insufficiency:
                  '-r0 - restart model from scratch'. This method is not
              optimal for any type of data sources, but it works fast and
              efficient in average, so it is the recommended method (default).
                  '-r1 - cut off model'. This method is optimal for
              quasistationary sources when the period of stationarity is much
              larger than period between cutoffs.  As a rule, it gives better
              results, but it is slower than other methods and it is unstable
              against fragmentation of memory heap at high model orders and
              low memory.
                  '-r2 - freeze model'. This method is optimal for stationary
              sources (show me such source when You will find it ;-)). It is
              fast and efficient for such sources.

EXAMPLES
       To run this program the standard way type:

       ppmd e /tmp/myfile

       Alternatively you can run it as:

       ppmd -e -o 16 /tmp/myfile
