NAME
       nyx - Tor terminal status monitor


SYNOPSIS
       nyx [OPTION]


DESCRIPTION
       Nyx is a command line interface for Tor (https://www.torproject.org/),
       providing detailed real-time relaying information for...

         * bandwidth, cpu, and memory usage
         * connection information
         * tor configuration
         * event logs
         * etc

       As a curses interface Nyx is particularly well suited for ssh
       connections, tty terminals, and command-line aficionados to check the
       status of tor.

       Nyx can be customized through a configuration file located at
       ~/.nyx/config. For options see
