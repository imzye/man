   SMS and EMS commands
       Sending messages might look a bit complicated on first attempt to use.
       But be patient, the command line has been written in order to allow
       almost every usage. See EXAMPLE section for some hints on usage.

       There is also an option to use gammu-smsd when you want to send or
       receive more messages and process them automatically.

   Introduction to SMS formats
       Gammu has support for many SMS formats like:

       Nokia Smart Messaging
              used for monochromatic picture images, downloadable profiles,
              monochromatic operator logos, monochromatic caller logos and
              monophonic ringtones

       Linked SMS
              both with 8 and 16-bit identification numbers in headers

       EMS    this is SMS format used for saving monochromatic images,
              monophonic ringtones, animations, text formatting and others

       MMS notifications
              contains links where phone should download MMS

       Alcatel logo messages
              proprietary format for logos

       You need to ensure that the target phone supports message type you want
       to send. Otherwise the phone will not be able to display it or will
       even crash, because firmware of phone did not expect this possibility.

   Encoding chars in SMS text
       Text in SMS can be coded using two ways:

   GSM Default Alphabet
       With GSM Default Alphabet you can fit at most 160 chars into single SMS
       (Gammu doesn't support compressing such texts according to GSM
       standards, but it isn't big limit, because there are no phones
       supporting them), but they're from limited set:

       • all Latin small and large

       • all digits

       • some Greek

       • some other national

       • some symbols like  @ ! " # & / ( ) % * + = - , . : ; < > ?

       • few others

   Unicode
       With Unicode single SMS can contain at most 70 chars, but these can be
       any chars including all national and special ones.

       WARNING:
          Please note, that some older phones might have problems displaying
          such message.

   Conversion
       Gammu tries to do the best to handle non ASCII characters in your
       message.  Everything is internally handled in Unicode (the input is
       converted depending on your locales configuration) and in case message
       uses Unicode the text will be given as such to the message.

       Should the message be sent in GSM Default Alphabet, Gammu will try to
       convert all characters to keep message readable. Gammu does support
       multi byte encoding for some characters in GSM Default Alphabet (it is
       needed for ^ { } \ [ ] ~ |). The characters which are not present in
       GSM Default Alphabet are transliterated to closest ASCII equivalent
       (accents are removed).  Remaining not known characters are replaced by
       question mark.

   SMS commands

       addsmsfolder name

       deleteallsms folder
              Delete all SMS from specified SMS folder.

       deletesms folder start [stop]
              Delete SMS from phone. See description for gammu getsms for info
              about sms folders naming convention.

              Locations are numerated from 1.

       displaysms ... (options like in sendsms)
              Displays PDU data of encoded SMS messages. It accepts same
              parameters and behaves same like sendsms.

       getallsms -pbk
              Get all SMS from phone. In some phones you will have also SMS
              templates and info about locations used to save Picture Images.
              With each sms you will see location. If you want to get such sms
              from phone alone, use gammu getsms.

       geteachsms -pbk
              Similiary to gammu getallsms. Difference is, that links all
              concatenated sms

       getsms folder start [stop]
              Get SMS.

              Locations are numerated from 1.

              Folder 0 means that sms is being read from "flat" memory (all
              sms from all folders have unique numbers). It's sometimes
              emulated by Gammu. You can use it with all phones.

              Other folders like 1, 2, etc. match folders in phone such as
              Inbox, Outbox, etc.  and each sms has unique number in his
              folder. Name of folders can depend on your phone (the most often
              1="Inbox", 2="Outbox", etc.).  This method is not supported by
              all phones (for example, not supported by Nokia 3310, 5110,
              6110). If work with your phone, use gammu getsmsfolders to get
              folders list.

       getsmsc [start [stop]]
              Get SMSC settings from SIM card.

              Locations are numerated from 1.

       getsmsfolders
              Get names for SMS folders in phone

       savesms TYPE [type parameters] [type options] [-folder id] [-unread]
       [-read] [-unsent] [-sent] [-sender number] [-smsname name] [-smscset
       number] [-smscnumber number] [-reply] [-maxsms num]
              Saves SMS to phone, see below for TYPE options.

                 -smscset number
                        SMSC number will be taken from phone stored SMSC
                        configuration number.

                        Default: 1

                 -smscnumber number
                        SMSC number

                 -reply reply SMSC is set

                 -folder number
                        save to specified folder.

                        Folders are numerated from 1.

                        The most often folder 1 = "Inbox", 2 = "Outbox",etc.
                        Use gammu getsmsfolders to get folder list.

                 -unread
                        makes message unread. In some phones (like 6210) you
                        won't see unread sms envelope after saving such sms.
                        In some phones with internal SMS memory (like 6210)
                        after using it with folder 1 SIM SMS memory will be
                        used

                 -read  makes message read. In some phones with internal SMS
                        memory (like 6210) after using it with folder 1 SIM
                        SMS memory will be used

                 -unsent
                        makes message unsent

                 -sent  makes message sent

                 -smsname name
                        set message name

                 -sender number
                        set sender number (default: Gammu)

                 -maxsms num
                        Limit maximum number of messages which will be
                        created. If there are more messages, Gammu will
                        terminate with failure.

                 Types of messages:

                 ANIMATION frames file1 file2...
                        Save an animation as a SMS. You need to give number of
                        frames and picture for each frame. Each picture can be
                        in any picture format which Gammu supports (B/W bmp,
                        gif, wbmp, nol, nlm...).

                 BOOKMARK file location
                        Read WAP bookmark from file created by gammu backup

                        read in backup file (usually 1, but can be useful in
                        case the backup contains more items).

                 CALLER file
                        Save caller logo as sms in Nokia (Smart Messaging)
                        format - size 72x14, two colors.

                        WARNING:
                           Please note, that it isn't designed for colour
                           logos available for example in DCT4/TIKU - you need
                           to put bitmap file there inside phone using
                           filesystem commands.

                 MMSINDICATOR URL Title Sender
                        Creates a MMS indication SMS. It contains URL where
                        the actual MMS payload is stored which needs to be
                        SMIL encoded. The phone usually downloads the MMS data
                        using special APN, which does not count to transmitted
                        data, however there might be limitations which URLs
                        can be accessed.

                 MMSSETTINGS file location
                        Saves a message with MMS configuration. The
                        configuration will be read from Gammu backup file from
                        given location.

                 OPERATOR file [-netcode netcode] [-biglogo]
                        Save operator logo as sms in Nokia (Smart Messaging)
                        format - size 72x14 in two colors.

                        -biglogo
                               Use 78x21 formatted logo instead of standard
                               72x14.

                        NOTE:
                           This isn't designed for colour logos available for
                           example in newer phones - you need to put bitmap
                           file there inside phone using filesystem commands.

                 PICTURE file [-text text] [-unicode] [-alcatelbmmi]
                        Read bitmap from 2 colors file (bmp, nlm, nsl, ngg,
                        nol, wbmp, etc.), format into bitmap in Smart
                        Messaging (72x28, 2 colors, called often Picture Image
                        and saved with text) or Alcatel format and send/save
                        over SMS.

                 PROFILE [-name name] [-bitmap bitmap] [-ringtone ringtone]
                        Read ringtone (RTTL) format, bitmap (Picture Image
                        size) and name, format into Smart Messaging profile
                        and send/save as SMS.

                        WARNING:
                           Please note, that this format is abandoned by Nokia
                           and supported by some (older) devices only like
                           Nokia 3310.

                 RINGTONE file [-long] [-scale]
                        Read RTTL ringtone from file and save as SMS into

                        Messaging) format.

                        -long  ringtone is saved using Profile style. It can
                               be longer (and saved in 2 SMS), but decoded
                               only by newer phones (like 33xx)

                        -scale ringtone will have Scale info for each note. It
                               will allow one to edit it correctly later in
                               phone composer (for example, in 33xx)

                               SMS will be saved in Unicode format

                               NOTE:
                                  The ~ char in SMS text and -unicode option
                                  (Unicode coding required) can cause text of
                                  SMS after ~ char  blink in some phones (like
                                  Nokia 33xx).

                        -inputunicode
                               input text is in Unicode.

                                  You can create Unicode file using WordPad in
                                  Windows (during saving select "Unicode Text
                                  Document" format). In Unix can use for
                                  example YUdit or vim.

                        -text  get text from command line instead of stdin.

                        -textutf8
                               get text in UTF-8 from command line instead of
                               stdin.

                               NOTE:
                                  Gammu detects your locales and uses by
                                  default encoding based on this. Use this
                                  option only when you know the input will be
                                  in UTF-8 in all cases.

                        -16bit Gammu uses SMS headers with 16-bit numbers for
                               saving linking info in SMS (it means less chars
                               available for user in each SMS)

                        -replacemessages ID
                               ID can be 1..7. When you will use option and
                               send more single SMS to one recipient with the
                               same ID, each another SMS will replace each
                               previous with the same ID

                        -replacefile file
                               File with replacement table in unicode (UCS-2),
                               preferably with byte order mark (BOM). It
                               contains pairs of chars, first one is to
                               replace, second is replacement one. The
                               replacement is done after reading text for the
                               message.

                               For example replacement 1 (0x0061) with a
                               (0x0031) would be done by file with following
                               content (hex dump, first two bytes is BOM):

                                  ff fe 61 00 31 00

                 TODO file location
                        Saves a message with a todo entry. The content will be
                        read from any backup format which Gammu supports and
                        from given location.

                 VCARD10|VCARD21 file SM|ME location [-nokia]

                        command and saves in VCARD 1.0 (only name and default
                        number) or VCARD 2.1 (all entry details with all
                        numbers, text and name) format as SMS.  The location
                        identifies position of contact item to be read in
                        backup file (usually 1, but can be useful in case the
                        backup contains more items).

                 WAPINDICATOR URL Title

                     request delivery report for message

              -validity HOUR|6HOURS|DAY|3DAYS|WEEK|MAX
                     sets how long will be the message valid (SMSC will the
                     discard the message after this time if it could not
                     deliver it).

       setsmsc location number
              Set SMSC settings on SIM card. This keeps all SMSC configuration
              intact, it just changes the SMSC number.

              Locations are numerated from 1.

   Memory (phonebooks and calls) commands

              -scale Scale information will be added to each note of RTTL
                     ringtone. It will avoid scale problems available during
                     editing ringtone in composer from phone menu (for
                     example, in Nokia 33xx).

              NOTE:

              All things backed up gammu backup can be restored (when made
              backup to Gammu text file).

              Please note that this adds all content of backup file to phone
              and does not care about current data in the phone (no duplicates
              are detected).

              Use -yes parameter to answer yes to all questions (you want to
              automatically restore all data).

              Use -memory parameter to force usage of defined memory type for
              storing entries regardless what backup format says.

       addsms folder file [-yes]
              Adds SMSes from file (format like gammu backupsms uses) to
              selected folder in phone.

       backup file [-yes]
              Backup your phone to file. It's possible to backup (depends on
              phone and backup format):

              • phonebook from SIM and phone memory

              • calendar notes

              • SMSC settings

              • operator logo

              • startup (static) logo or startup text

              • WAP bookmarks

              • WAP settings

              • caller logos and groups

              • user ringtones

              There are various backup formats supported and the backup format
              is guessed based on file extension:

              • .lmb - Nokia backup, supports contacts, caller logos and
                startup logo.

              • .vcs - vCalendar, supports calendar and todo.

              • .vcf - vCard, supports contacts.

              • .ldif - LDAP import, supports contacts.

              • .ics - iCalendar, supports calendar and todo.

              • Any other extension is Gammu backup file and it supports all
                data mentioned above, see gammu-backup for more details.

              By default this command is interactive and asks which items tou
              want to backup.

              Use -yes for answering yes to all questions.

       backupsms file [-yes|-all]
              Stores all SMSes from phone to file into gammu-smsbackup.

              By default this command is interactive and asks which folders
              you want to backup and whether you want to remove messages from
              phone afterwards.

              Use -yes for answering yes to all questions (backup all messages
              and delete them from phone), or -all to just backup all folders
              while keeping messages in phone.

       restore file [-yes]

              WARNING:
                 Please note that restoring deletes all current content in
                 phone. If you want only to add entries to phone, use gammu
                 addnew.

              Restore settings written in file created using gammu backup
              command.

              In some phones restoring calendar notes will not show error, but
              won't be done, when phone doesn't have set clock inside.

       restoresms file [-yes]

              WARNING:
                 Please note that this overwrites existing messages in phone
                 (if it supports it).

              Restores SMSes from file (format like gammu backupsms uses) to
              selected folder in phone.

       savefile TYPE [type options]
              Converts between various file formats supported by Gammu,
              following types are supported:

              BOOKMARK target.url file location
                     Converts backup format supported by Gammu to vBookmark

                     Allows one to convert between various backup formats
                     which gammu supports for calendar events. The file type
                     is guessed (for input file guess is based on extension
                     and file content, for output solely on extension).

              TODO target.vcs file location
                     Allows one to convert between various backup formats
                     which gammu supports for todo events. The file type is
                     guessed (for input file guess is based on extension and
                     file content, for output solely on extension).

              VCARD10|VCARD21 target.vcf file SM|ME location
                     Allows one to convert between various backup formats
                     which gammu supports for phonebook events. The file type
                     is guessed (for input file guess is based on extension
                     and file content, for output solely on extension).

              Converts backup between formats supported by Gammu. Unlike gammu
              savefile, this does not give you any options what to convert, it
              simply takes converts all what can be saved into output file.

       nokiaaddplaylists
              Goes through phone memory and generated playlist for all music
              files found.

              To manually manage playlists:

                 gammu addfile a:\\predefplaylist filename.m3u

              Will add playlist filename.m3u

                 gammu getfilesystem

              Will get list of all files (including names of files with
              playlists)

                 gammu deletefiles a:\\predefplaylist\\filename.m3u

              Will delete playlist filename.m3u

              Format of m3u playlist is easy (standard mp3 playlist):

              First line is #EXTM3U, next lines contain  names of files
              (b:\file1.mp3, b:\folder1\file2.mp3, etc.). File needs t have
              \r\n terminated lines. So just run unix2dos on the resulting

              extension is automatically appended to filename based on what
              data phone provides.

   Batch mode commands

       batch [file]
              Starts Gammu in a batch mode. In this mode you can issue several
              commands each on one line. Lines starting with # are treated as
              a comments.

              By default, commands are read from standard input, but you can
              optionally specify a file from where they would be read (special
              case - means standard input).

   Configuration commands

       searchphone [-debug]
              Attempts to search for a connected phone.

              WARNING:
                 Please note that this can take a very long time, but in case
                 you have no clue how to configure phone connection, this is a
                 convenient way to find working setup for Gammu.

       install [-minimal]
              Installs applet for currently configured connection to the
              phone.

              You can configure search path for installation files by
              DataPath.

              The -minimal parameter forces installation of applet only
              without possible support libraries, this can be useful for
              updates.

   Gammu information commands

       checkversion [STABLE]
              Checks whether there is newer Gammu version available online (if
              Gammu has been compiled with CURL). If you pass additional
              parameter STABLE, only stable versions will be checked.

       features
              Print information about compiled in features.

       help [topic]
              Print help. By default general help is printed, but you can also
              specify a help category to get more detailed help on some topic.

       version
              Print version information and license.
