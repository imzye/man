FEATURES
       Features as described on the fossil home page.


       1.  Integrated Bug Tracking, Wiki, Forum, and Technotes - In addition
              to doing distributed version control like Git and Mercurial,
              Fossil also supports bug tracking, wiki, forum, and technotes.


       2.  Built-in Web Interface - Fossil has a built-in and intuitive web
              interface that promotes project situational awareness. Type
              "fossil ui" and Fossil automatically opens a web browser to a
              page that shows detailed graphical history and status
              information on that project.


       3.  Self-Contained - Fossil is a single self-contained stand-alone
              executable. To install, simply download a precompiled binary for
              Linux, Mac, OpenBSD, or Windows and put it on your $PATH. Easy-
              to-compile source code is available for users on other
              platforms.


       4.  Simple Networking - No custom protocols or TCP ports. Fossil uses
              plain old HTTP (or HTTPS or SSH) for all network communications,
              so it works fine from behind restrictive firewalls, including
              proxies. The protocol is bandwidth efficient to the point that
              Fossil can be used comfortably over dial-up or over the
              exceedingly slow Wifi on airliners.


       5.  CGI/SCGI Enabled - No server is required, but if you want to set
              one up, Fossil supports four easy server configurations.


       6.  Autosync - Fossil supports "autosync" mode which helps to keep
              projects moving forward by reducing the amount of needless
              forking and merging often associated with distributed projects.


       7.  Robust & Reliable - Fossil stores content using an enduring file
              format in an SQLite database so that transactions are atomic
              even if interrupted by a power loss or system crash. Automatic
              self-checks verify that all aspects of the repository are
              consistent prior to each commit.


       8.  Free and Open-Source - Uses the 2-clause BSD license.
