form_field_opts(3X)                                        form_field_opts(3X)



NAME
       set_field_opts, field_opts_on, field_opts_off, field_opts - set and get
       field options

SYNOPSIS
       #include <form.h>
       int set_field_opts(FIELD *field, Field_Options opts);
       int field_opts_on(FIELD *field, Field_Options opts);
       int field_opts_off(FIELD *field, Field_Options opts);
       Field_Options field_opts(const FIELD *field);

DESCRIPTION
       The function set_field_opts sets all the given field's option bits
       (field option bits may be logically-OR'ed together).

       The function field_opts_on turns on the given option bits, and leaves
       others alone.

       The function field_opts_off turns off the given option bits, and leaves
       others alone.

       The function field_opts returns the field's current option bits.

       The following standard options are defined (all are on by default):

       O_ACTIVE
            The field is visited during processing.  If this option is off,
            the field will not be reachable by navigation keys.  Please notice
            that an invisible field appears to be inactive also.

       O_AUTOSKIP
            Skip to the next field when this one fills.

       O_BLANK
            The field is cleared whenever a character is entered at the first
            position.

       O_EDIT
            The field can be edited.

       O_NULLOK
            Allow a blank field.

       O_PASSOK
            Validate field only if modified by user.

       O_PUBLIC
            The field contents are displayed as data is entered.

       O_STATIC
            Field buffers are fixed to field's original size.  Turn this
            option off to create a dynamic field.

       O_VISIBLE
            The field is displayed.  If this option is off, display of the
            field is suppressed.

       O_WRAP
            Words that do not fit on a line are wrapped to the next line.
            Words are blank-separated.

       These extension options are defined (extensions are off by default):

       O_DYNAMIC_JUSTIFY
            Permit dynamic fields to be justified, like static fields.

       O_NO_LEFT_STRIP
            Preserve leading whitespace in the field buffer, which is normally
            discarded.

       O_EDGE_INSERT_STAY
            When inserting into a field up to the boundary position,
            optionally delay the scrolling, so that the last inserted
            character remains visible, but advance the cursor to reflect the
            insertion.  This allows the form library to display the inserted
            character in one-character fields as well as allowing the library
            to maintain consistent state.

       O_INPUT_FIELD
            The set_max_field function checks for this extension, which allows
            a dynamic field to shrink if the new limit is smaller than the
            current field size.

RETURN VALUE
       Except for field_opts, each routine returns one of the following:

       E_OK The routine succeeded.

       E_BAD_ARGUMENT
            Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.

       E_CURRENT
            The field is the current field.

       E_SYSTEM_ERROR
            System error occurred (see errno(3)).

SEE ALSO
       curses(3X), form(3X).  form_field_just(3X).

NOTES
       The header file <form.h> automatically includes the header file
       <curses.h>.

PORTABILITY
       These routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not
       supported on Version 7 or BSD versions.
