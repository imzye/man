NAME
       Modern::Perl - enable all of the features of Modern Perl with one
       import

VERSION
       version 1.20250607

SYNOPSIS
       Modern Perl programs use several modules to enable additional features
       of Perl and of the CPAN.  Instead of copying and pasting all of these
       "use" lines, instead write only one:

           use Modern::Perl;

       This enables the strict and warnings pragmas, as well as all of the
       features available in Perl 5.10. It also enables C3 method resolution
       order as documented in "perldoc mro" and loads IO::File and IO::Handle
       so that you may call methods on filehandles. In the future, it may
       include additional core modules and pragmas (but is unlikely to include
       non-core features).

       Because so much of this module's behavior uses lexically scoped
       pragmas, you may disable these pragmas within an inner scope with:

           no Modern::Perl;

       See
       <http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2009/01/toward-a-modernperl.html>
       for more information, <http://www.modernperlbooks.com/> for further
       discussion of Modern Perl and its implications, and
       <http://onyxneon.com/books/modern_perl/index.html> for a freely-
       downloadable Modern Perl tutorial.

   CLI Usage
       As of Modern::Perl 2019, you may also enable this pragma from the
       command line:

           $ perl -Modern::Perl -e 'say "Take that, awk!"'

       You may also enable year-specific features:

           $ perl -Modern::Perl=2020 -e 'say "Looking forward to Perl 5.30!"'

   Wrapping Modern::Perl
       If you want to wrap Modern::Perl in your own import() method, you can
       do so to add additional pragmas or features, such as the use of
       Try::Tiny. Please note that, if you do so, you will not automatically
       enable C3 method resolution in the calling scope. This is due to how
       the mro pragma works. In your custom import() method, you will need to
       write code such as:

           mro::set_mro( scalar caller(), 'c3' );

   Forward Compatibility
       For forward compatibility, I recommend you specify a string containing
       a year value as the single optional import tag. For example:

           use Modern::Perl '2009';
           use Modern::Perl '2010';

       ... both enable 5.10 features, while:

           use Modern::Perl '2011';

       ... enables 5.12 features:

           use Modern::Perl '2012';

       ... enables 5.14 features:

           use Modern::Perl '2013';

       ... enables 5.16 features, and:

           use Modern::Perl '2014';

       ... enables 5.18 features, and:

           use Modern::Perl '2015';

       ... enables 5.20 features, and:

           use Modern::Perl '2016';

       ... enables 5.24 features, and:

           use Modern::Perl '2017';

       ... enables 5.24 features, and:

           use Modern::Perl '2018';

       ... enables 5.26 features, and:

           use Modern::Perl '2019';

       ... enables 5.28 features, and:

           use Modern::Perl '2020';

       ... enables 5.30 features, and:

           use Modern::Perl '2021';

       ... enables 5.32 features, and:

           use Modern::Perl '2022';

       ... enables 5.34 features, and:

           use Modern::Perl '2023';

       ... enables 5.36 features, and:

           use Modern::Perl '2024';

       ... enables 5.38 features, and:

           use Modern::Perl '2025';

       ... enables 5.40 features.

       Obviously you cannot use newer features on earlier versions. Perl will
       throw the appropriate exception if you try.

       As of Perl 5.38, you may prefer to write "use v5.38", which is almost
       entirely equivalent to the use of this module. For the purpose of
       forward compatibility, this module will continue to work as
       expected--and will continue regular maintenance.

       As of Perl 5.41.4, "given" is no longer available, so any import tags
       for older versions of Perl will not enable this feature, no matter how
       much you try.
