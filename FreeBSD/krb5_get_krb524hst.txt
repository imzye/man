KRB5_GET_KRBHST(3)     FreeBSD Library Functions Manual     KRB5_GET_KRBHST(3)

NAME
     krb5_get_krbhst, krb5_get_krb_admin_hst, krb5_get_krb_changepw_hst,
     krb5_get_krb524hst, krb5_free_krbhst – lookup Kerberos KDC hosts

LIBRARY
     Kerberos 5 Library (libkrb5, -lkrb5)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <krb5.h>

     krb5_error_code
     krb5_get_krbhst(krb5_context context, const krb5_realm *realm,
         char ***hostlist);

     krb5_error_code
     krb5_get_krb_admin_hst(krb5_context context, const krb5_realm *realm,
         char ***hostlist);

     krb5_error_code
     krb5_get_krb_changepw_hst(krb5_context context, const krb5_realm *realm,
         char ***hostlist);

     krb5_error_code
     krb5_get_krb524hst(krb5_context context, const krb5_realm *realm,
         char ***hostlist);

     krb5_error_code
     krb5_free_krbhst(krb5_context context, char **hostlist);

DESCRIPTION
     These functions implement the old API to get a list of Kerberos hosts,
     and are thus similar to the krb5_krbhst_init() functions. However, since
     these functions returns all hosts in one go, they potentially have to do
     more lookups than necessary. These functions remain for compatibility
     reasons.

     After a call to one of these functions, hostlist is a NULL terminated
     list of strings, pointing to the requested Kerberos hosts. These should
     be freed with krb5_free_krbhst() when done with.

EXAMPLES
     The following code will print the KDCs of the realm “MY.REALM”.

           char **hosts, **p;
           krb5_get_krbhst(context, "MY.REALM", &hosts);
           for(p = hosts; *p; p++)
               printf("%s\n", *p);
           krb5_free_krbhst(context, hosts);
