SNORT2PFCD(8)           FreeBSD System Manager's Manual          SNORT2PFCD(8)

NAME
     snort2pfcd – provides real-time blocking of ip addresses from snort
     alerts via packet filter firewall tables.

SYNOPSIS
     snort2pfcd [-e External_Interface] [-w Passlist_File] [-b Blocklist_File]
                [-W] [-B] [-C] [-D] [-F] [-Z] [-l Log_File] [-a Alert_File]
                [-p Priority] [-r Repeat_Offenses] [-t Seconds] [-d Pf_device]
                [-q Seconds] [-m Thr_max] [-v] [-h]

DESCRIPTION
     snort2pfcd monitors snort alert output and blocks ip addresses for a
     given snort priority using packet filter table entries for a specified
     period of time. A passlist is specified to exclude local and trusted ip
     addresses from being blocked.  snort2pfcd also preloads the community
     maintained and supplied snort blocklist by default. The passlist and
     blocklist files are monitored and snort2pfcd automatically reloads and
     updates the tables when changes are made to these files.

     The options are as follows:

     -e External_Interface
             external interface e.g. eth0 or "all" to passlist all interfaces,
             default is to passlist all interfaces.

     -w Passlist_File
             passlist file, default is
             /usr/local/etc/snort/rules/iplists/default.passlist.

     -W      If set, will prevent loading of any passlist file.

     -b Blocklist_File
             blocklist file, default is
             /usr/local/etc/snort/rules/iplists/default.blocklist.

     -B      If set, will prevent loading of the snort blocklist file.

     -C      If set, will enable debug mode for gdb, lldb, etc.

     -D      If set, will disable the DNS lookup functionality.

     -F      Foreground mode. If set, will not daemonize.

     -Z      If set, will prevent the passlisting of entries in the
             /etc/resolv.conf file.

     -l Log_File
             log file location, default is /var/log/snort2pfcd.log.

     -a Alert_File
             snort alert file location, default is /var/log/snort/alert.

     -p Priority
             The priority level at which to block an ip addresses in the snort
             log. Default is 1.  Lower priority includes higher priority, for
             example, -p 3 includes priorities 3, 2 and 1.

     -r Repeat_Offenses
             Number of times an ip address may commit an offense before being
             added to the packet filter block table.  Default is 0. For
             example, -p 2 -r 2 specifies that any priority 1 or 2 snort alert
             for a given network address will be blocked only after 2 repeated
             snort alerts (3 snort alerts total).

     -t Seconds
             The number of seconds to block an ip address, default is 60*60 or
             1 hour.

     -d Pf_device
             Packet filter device interface. Default is /dev/pf.

     -q Seconds
             The number of seconds to wait before starting to parse the snort
             alert file. Useful if snort2pfcd is interfering with connection
             setup, especially shortly after boot. Default is 0.

     -m thr_max
             Maximum number of DNS request threads. Default is 100.
             snort2pfcd uses a non-blocking design to ensure that waiting for
             DNS names to resolve in the block log do not interfere with the
             blocking of snort alerts. Instead of the main program waiting, a
             new thread is spawned to do the waiting. Since connection speeds
             vary widely (100mb/s - >40Gb/s) and servers also vary in terms of
             processing capability, the option exists to increase or decrease
             the maximum number of threads waiting for DNS requests. Once the
             maximum number of threads waiting for a DNS response is reached,
             logging will stop until an active thread exits. The main program
             however will continue its blocking function with a cessation in
             logging until a new thread can be spawned.

     -v      Increase verbosity.

     -h      Show help.

THEORY OF OPERATION
     The snort intrusion detection system monitors network traffic and will
     generate an alert if this traffic matches a rule for a type of noteworthy
     activity.  snort2pfcd monitors this alert file and can then add the
     offending ip address to a packet filter block table.  snort2pfcd provides
     the above options for the user to specify the conditions under which the
     offending address is added to the packet filter block table.

     Differentiating between benign and malicious network traffic is difficult
     and, unfortunately, snort generates a fair amount of false-positives.
     Also, the snort IDS primary function is to log noteworthy network traffic
     and its authors did not necessarily intend for the logged addresses to be
     blocked. This being said, snorts rules are highly configurable and can be
     adjusted for more appropriate functioning in this context. To assist the
     user with filtering network traffic produced by various network entities,
     snort2pfcd will automatically resolve the offending ip address and
     display the DNS name in the snort2pfcd block log. Should the user decide
     that the offending address is trustworthy, the user can add the address,
     or alternatively, research and add the entire CIDR address block assigned
     to that network entity, to the passlist. Passlisted addresses or CIDR
     address blocks generating a snort alert will not be added to the packet
     filter block table.

     snort2pfcd also loads the snort community supplied blocklist file into a
     separate packet filter block table by default. Table entries are named
     "snort2pfcd" for dynamic entries which can be viewed with "pfctl -t
     snort2pfcd -T show". Static entries loaded from the community provided
     snort blocklist are populated within the "snort2pfcd_static" table which
     can be viewed with "pfctl -t snort2pfcd_static -T show".

     At no time should snort2pfcd need to be restarted.  snort2pfcd will
     repopulate its packet filter tables if the packet filter is restarted.
     snort2pfcd also monitors the passlist and blocklist files for changes.
     Changes applied to these files are automatically reloaded and applied to
     the running snort2pfcd processes.

FILES
Passlist
     Passlist entries can be single ip addressess (e.g. 192.168.0.1) or blocks
     of addresses in CIDR format (e.g. 192.168.0.0/24). Each entry should be
     on a separate line.

Blocklist
     Blocklist entries provided by the snort community contain a list of
     single ip addresses and snort2pfcd will only accept entries in this
     format (e.g. 192.168.0.1). Each entry should be on a separate line.

NOTES
     While snort2pfcd will parse the default snort alert file, this can
     produce less than real-time blocking given the burden being placed on
     snort especially over an active, fast or low-latency connection. The
     author would strongly recommend using a spooler like barnyard2 to output
     the text alerts from the snort unified2 binary output.

     By default, the user-supplied passlist is prepended with the addresses of
     all of the local interfaces as the handling of these addresses are
     usually specified by more complex packet filter rules and simply blocking
     these addresses can cause problems with certain configurations.

     The user-supplied passlist can also be prepended with the address of the
     external interface only for paranoid configurations. Lo0 is always
     passlisted.

     snort2pfcd also automatically passlists addresses found within the
     /etc/resolv.conf file as these addresses should also be handled by
     specific packet filter rules.

     A static blocklist table is also maintained and populated within the
     packet filter firewall with the addresses found within the
     /usr/local/etc/snort/rules/iplists/default.blocklist file. These
     addresses can be supplied by the user or automatically populated with
     addresses supplied by the snort community.

     This program is based on snort2c written by Antonio Benojar which was
     based on the original snort2pf perl script written by Stephan Schmieder.

     Blocking functionality based on pfctl and pftabled functions by Armin
     Wolfermann.
