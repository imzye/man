NAME
       userneu.conf - Configuration file of userneu(8)

DESCRIPTION
       userneu.conf controls the behaviour of userneu(8). The settings of this
       configuration file are overriden by options specified on the command
       line. It is just a collection of variables sourced by userneu(8) using
       the 'do' function. Therefore it

       1.   Has the same syntax as perl source (Dollar signs in front of
            variables, semicolons after each line)

       2.   Is treated like a piece of perl code so you want to make
            absolutely sure that it's permissions are correct so nobody can
            smuggle in malicious code.

       The settings are as follows:

       $userlist
            The file to read user information from (only relevant if invoked
            as userneu). Defaults to "userlist"

       $group
            The login or primary group for the users to be created. Defaults
            to "users". If this is a percent sign followed by a number (and
            the script is called as userneu) the script reads the primary
            group information from the field in the input file denoted by that
            number, e.g. a value of '%4' causes the script to use the value in
            the 4th field of the input file as primary group.  This is useful
            if you don't want to specify the primary group globally for all
            new users but individually for each user.

       $homebase
            The base directory for the users' homes, for example
            "/home/users/".  Defaults to "/home/$group".

       $smbpass
            The location of the smbpasswd(8) binary. Defaults to
            "/usr/local/bin/smbpasswd". If this option is set it implies
            $generate_samba.

       $outfile
            Location of the file to which the data of the completed accounts
            (user name, password etc.) are written. Protect this file well as
            it contains cleartext passwords. Defaults to "useraccounts". Use
            "-" for STDOUT.

       $descriptor
            Set the descriptors for the various fields in the input file (if
            invoked as userneu) or the argument to -u (if invoked as
            userquick). The descriptors are semicolon separated. Defaults to
            "user name;real name;class"

       $delimiter
            Expects a Perl regular expression that describes the field
            delimiter of the input file (slash delimited). This option is only
            relevant if the script is invoked as userneu. Defaults to "/\t/"
            which is a tab character.

       $passtype
            Describes the characteristics of the automatically created
            passwords.  Valid settings are "letters" (random lower case
            letters) and "chars" (misc case letters, special characters,
            numbers). Defaults to "letters".

       $pass_minlength
            Set the minimum password length. Defaults to 8.

       $pass_maxlength
            Set the maximum password length. Defaults to 8.

       $paranoid_pass
            This setting expects a boolean value and controls the type of
            passwords the script generates. By default this is set to 0, in
            which case $passtype is set to "letters" and $pass_minlength and
            $pass_maxlength are set to 8. If this Option is set to 1,
            $passtype is set to "chars" and $pass_minlength and
            $pass_maxlength are set to 10. Either of $passtype,
            $pass_minlength, $pass_maxlength takes precedence over this
            option, i.e. if you set $paranoid_pass to 1 and $passtype to
            "letters" the passwords will still have a length of 10 characters
            but they will consist only of lowercase letters.

       $generate_samba
            This exspects a boolean value and determines if the script is
            supposed to create samba accounts in addition to unix accounts.
            Defaults to 0.

       $schoolyear_add
            Expects a boolean value. The script will ad the "school year" to
            the GECOS field if this option enabled. If you need this you
            probably know what this is about, if not you can safely ignore it.
            It defaults to 0.

       $dupe_engine_enable
            Expects a boolean value. If enabled the script will try to append
            one or two random characters to already existing user names it
            encounters until it finds one that doesn't exit yet. Defaults to
            0.

       $errlog
            Specify the location of the error log for already existing user
            names.  Only relevant if $dupe_engine_enable is set to 0. Defaults
            to "duplicate_users".

       $member_groups
            Expects a comma separated list of member groups for the users the
            script creates. If this is a percent sign followed by a number
            (and the script is called as userneu) the script reads the member
            group information from the field in the input file denoted by that
            number, e.g. a value of '%4' causes the script to use a comma-
            separated list of groups in the 4th field of the input file as
            member groups.  This is useful if you don't want to specify the
            primary group globally for all new users but individually for each
            user.

       $generate_shellscript
            Expects a boolean value. Controls if a shell script is to be
            output to automatically create users on target systems that don't
            have a Perl distribution.

       $shellscript_output
            Specify the location of the shellscript for target systems without
            Perl.  Defaults to "createusers.sh". If this option is set it
            implies $generate_shellscript. Use "-" for STDOUT.

       $target_system
            Set the target system for createusers.sh. Defaults to the system
            userneu is running on. If this option is set it implies
            $generate_shellscript.
