NAME
       elm - an interactive mail system

SYNOPSIS
       elm [ -achkKMmrtwz ] [ -f alternate-folder ] [ -d debug-level ]
       elm [ -s subject ] list of aliases or addresses

DESCRIPTION
       Elm is an interactive screen-oriented mailer program that supersedes
       mail and mailx.

       There are three main ways to use the elm mailer.  One way to use the
       mailer is to specify a list of addresses on the command line when the
       mailer is invoked.  This will allow sending of a single message to the
       specified recipients with all the options usually available in the elm
       system itself. For example, the command

            elm -s testing joe

       would initiate the sending of a message to the alias joe with the
       subject "testing" indicated and would put you into an editor for you to
       enter the text of the message.  If the subject flag and argument were
       not present, you would be prompted for a message subject.

       The second way, used most commonly when transmitting files and such, is
       to specify the subject of the message and the recipients using the
       command line and redirect a file as standard input.  For example, the
       command

            elm -s testing joe < test.c

       would mail a copy of the file test.c to alias joe, with the subject
       "testing" indicated.  The subject flag and argument are optional.

       The third way, elm is invoked with neither subject nor addresses
       specified on the command line and without standard input redirected.
       You can then read any messages in your incoming mailbox (or specified
       folder), reply to messages in the mailbox, mail messages, etc.

       Options are:

         -a      Arrow - force the arrow cursor (instead of the inverse bar)

         -c      Checkalias - expand the following aliases and return.

         -d level
                 Debug - set specified debug level - Output to
                 "$HOME/ELM:debug.info"

         -f alternative-folder
                 Folder - read folder (specified) rather than the incoming
                 mailbox.

         -h      Help - give a list of starting options.

         -i file
                 Include - include prepared file in edit buffer for sending.

         -?      Synonymous with the "-h" option.

         -k      Keypad - force knowledge of HP terminal keyboard, to allow
                 the use of the NEXT, PREV and HOME/SHIFT-HOME keys.

         -K      Keypad + softkeys - enable use of softkeys on HP terminals
                 only.

         -M      Magic mode - treat all folders as if they were the spool
                 folder (lock, update Status: headers, etc.).

         -m      Menu off - Use the extra lines for more message headers.

         -r elmrc
                 Rcfile - use file specified rather than the default elmrc.

         -s subj
                 Subject - specify subject for message to mail.

         -t      tite - turn off usage of the termcap/terminfo ti/te sequence.

         -v      Version - print version and configuration information.

         -z      Zero - don't enter Elm if no mail is pending.
