NAME
       vhier - Return all files in a verilog hierarchy using Verilog::Netlist

SYNOPSIS
         vhier --help
         vhier [verilog_options] [-o filename] [verilog_files.v...]

DESCRIPTION
       Vhier reads the Verilog files passed on the command line and outputs a
       tree of all of the filenames, modules, and cells referenced by that
       file.

VERILOG ARGUMENTS
       The following arguments are compatible with GCC, VCS and most Verilog
       programs.

       +define+var+value =item -Dvar=value
           Defines the given preprocessor symbol.

       -F file
           Read the specified file, and act as if all text inside it was
           specified as command line parameters.  Any relative paths are
           relative to the directory containing the specified file.

       -f file
           Read the specified file, and act as if all text inside it was
           specified as command line parameters.  Any relative paths are
           relative to the current directory.

       +incdir+dir =item -Idir
           Add the directory to the list of directories that should be
           searched for include directories or libraries.

       +libext+ext+ext...
           Specify the extensions that should be used for finding modules.  If
           for example module x is referenced, look in x.ext.

       -sv Specifies SystemVerilog language features should be enabled;
           equivalent to "--language 1800-2023".  This option is selected by
           default, it exists for compatibility with other simulators.

       -y dir
           Add the directory to the list of directories that should be
           searched for include directories or libraries.

VHIER ARGUMENTS
       --help
           Displays this message and program version and exits.

       --o file
           Use the given filename for output instead of stdout.

       --cells
           Show the module name of all cells in top-down order.

       --forest
           Show "ASCII-art" hierarchy tree of all cells (like ps --forest)

       --input-files
           Show all input filenames.  Copying all of these files should result
           in only those files needed to represent the entire design.

       --includes
           Show each source filename that includes another filename.  The
           included filename will be as specified in the original source
           filename, so it may be necessary to resolve it into an absolute
           path for further processing.

       --instance
           With --cells or --forest, show module instance names.

       --language
       <1364-1995|1364-2001|1364-2005|1800-2005|1800-2009|1800-2012|1800-2017|1800-2023>
           Set the language standard for the files.  This determines which
           tokens are signals versus keywords, such as the ever-common "do"
           (data-out signal, versus a do-while loop keyword).

       --resolve-files
           Show resolved filenames passed on the command line.  This will
           convert raw module and filenames without paths to include the
           library search path directory.  Output filenames will be in the
           same order as passed on the command line.  Unlike --input-files or
           --module-files, hierarchy is not traversed.

       --module-files
           Show all module filenames in top-down order.  Child modules will
           always appear as low as possible, so that reversing the list will
           allow bottom-up processing of modules.  Unlike input-files, header
           files are not included.

       --modules
           Show all module names.

       --no-missing
           Do not complain about references to missing modules.

       --missing-modules
           With --nomissing, show all modules that are not found.

       --skiplist file
           Given file contains a list of regular expressions, one per line. If
           a module name in the design hierarchy matches one of these
           expressions, skip showing that module and any sub-hierarchy.

       --synthesis
           Define SYNTHESIS, and ignore text between "ambit", "pragma",
           "synopsys" or "synthesis" translate_off and translate_on meta
           comments.  Note using metacomments is discouraged as they have led
           to silicon bugs (versus ifdef SYNTHESIS); see
           <https://www.veripool.org/papers/TenIPEdits_SNUGBos07_paper.pdf>.

       --top-module module
           Start the report at the specified module name, ignoring all modules
           that are not the one specified with --top-module or below, and
           report an error if the --top-module specified does not exist.
           Without this option vhier will report all modules, starting at the
           module(s) that have no children below them.

           Note this option will not change the result of the --input-files
           list, as the files needed to parse any design are independent of
           which modules are used.

       --version
           Displays program version and exits.

       --xml
           Create output in XML format.
