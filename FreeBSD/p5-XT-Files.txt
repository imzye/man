NAME
       Test::XTFiles - standard interface for author tests to find files to
       check

VERSION
       Version 0.002

SYNOPSIS
           use Test::XTFiles;

           my @files = Test::XTFiles->new->all_module_files;

DESCRIPTION
       Author tests often iterate over the files of a distribution to check
       them.  XT::Files is a standard interface that allows the author test to
       ask the distribution for all the files of a type, instead of guessing
       which files to check.

USAGE
   all_executable_files
       Returns a list of all the Perl scripts that should be tested. This
       includes tests, if the distribution added them. You should test them as
       you test Perl scripts.

       This list can be useful for tests that test things like execute
       permission or the shebang line.

   all_files
       Returns all files that should be tested. A typical use case would be to
       test all files that contain Pod documentation as Pod can be, but
       doesn't have to be, included in scripts, modules, tests and, of course,
       pod files.

           # all files with Pod in it
           use Pod::Simple::Search;
           my @files = grep { Pod::Simple::Search->new->contains_pod($_) }
               Test::XTFiles->new->all_files;

   all_module_files
       Returns a list of all Perl modules that should be tested.

       Before using this method make sure that you really want to test only
       modules.  Most tests should run against modules and scripts. It's often
       better to use the "all_perl_files" method instead.

   all_perl_files
       Returns a list of all Perl files that should be tested. That includes
       modules, scripts and, if the distribution added them, tests. Most
       author tests should probably iterate over this list.

   all_pod_files
       Returns a list of all Pod files. These are the files that end in
       ".pod".  This list does not contain script or modules that include a
       Pod documentation.

       It's probably better to use the "all_files" method and check which
       files contain Pod.

   all_test_files
       Returns a list of all ".t" files to be tested, if added by the
       distribution.

   files
       Returns a list of all files to be tested as XT::Files::File objects.
