NAME
       GDBM_File - Perl5 access to the gdbm library.

SYNOPSIS
           use GDBM_File ;
           tie %hash, 'GDBM_File', $filename, &GDBM_WRCREAT, 0640;
           # Use the %hash array.
           untie %hash ;

DESCRIPTION
       GDBM_File is a module which allows Perl programs to make use of the
       facilities provided by the GNU gdbm library.  If you intend to use this
       module you should really have a copy of the gdbm manualpage at hand.

       Most of the libgdbm.a functions are available through the GDBM_File
       interface.

AVAILABILITY
       gdbm is available from any GNU archive.  The master site is
       "ftp.gnu.org", but you are strongly urged to use one of the many
       mirrors.  You can obtain a list of mirror sites from
       http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html.

BUGS
       The available functions and the gdbm/perl interface need to be
       documented.

       The GDBM error number and error message interface needs to be added.
