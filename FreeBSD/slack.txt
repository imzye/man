NAME
       slack-diff - compare file contents, modes, etc

SYNOPSIS
       slack-diff [OPTION]... FILE1 FILE2

DESCRIPTION
       A wrapper for diff that displays file modes and other metadata changes.

       -u  -U NUM  --unified[=NUM]
              Tell diff(1) to use unified output format.

       --diff PROG
              Use this program for diffing, instead of diff.

       --fakediff
              Make a fake diff for file modes and other things that are not
              file contents.  Default is on, can be disabled with
              --nofakediff.

       -r  --recursive
              Recursively compare any subdirectories found.

       -N  --new-file
              Treat missing files as empty.  Default is on, can be disabled
              with --nonew-file.

       --unidirectional-new-file
              Treat only missing files in the first directory as empty.

       --from-file
              Treat arguments as a list of files from which to read filenames
              to compare, two lines at a time.

       -0  --null
              Use NULLs instead of newlines as the separator in --from-file
              mode.

       --devnullhack
              You have a version of diff that can't deal with -N when not in
              recursive mode, so we need to feed it /dev/null instead of the
              missing file.  Default is on, can be disabled with
              --nodevnullhack.


       --version
              Output version info.

       --help Output this help.

       FILES are `FILE1 FILE2' or `DIR1 DIR2' or `DIR FILE...' or `FILE...
       DIR'.  If --from-file or --to-file is given, there are no restrictions
       on FILES.  If a FILE is `-', read standard input.
