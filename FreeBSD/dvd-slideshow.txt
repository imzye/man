NAME
       dir2slideshow - Creates an input file for dvd-slideshow from pictures
       in a directory.

SYNOPSIS
       dir2slideshow [-o <output directory>] [-t <Seconds per picture>] [-c
       <Crossfade seconds>] -n <Slideshow name> [-T] [-M] [-s subtitle_text]
       [-notitle] <Images directory>

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a input file for dvd-slideshow from all the JPEG images in a
       given directory.  Now it reads all .jpg .JPG .jpeg .png and .PNG files
       in the specified directory.

OPTIONS
       <Images directory>
              The path to the directory containing the images you want to use.


       -n <Slideshow name>
              The name of this slideshow.  This name is used as the default
              title text for the first title slide in the slideshow. This name
              will be used for the output file name.


       [-t <Seconds per picture>]
              Number of seconds to display each picture in the movie.
              Defaults to 5 seconds if not specified.


       [-o <Output directory>]
              Directory where the output file will be written.  If not
              specified, the current directory is used.


       [-c <Crossfade seconds>]
              Number of seconds to crossfade between images. One second is
              usually fine.  Note that this will increase the processing time,
              but it looks nice.


       [-w <Wipe seconds>]
              Number of seconds to wipe between images. One second is usually
              fine.  Pick either crossfade or wipe, but not both.


       [-T]   Sort images by the JPEG header picture taken time, then by the
              file modification date, and finally by the filename. Default
              sort is by name only. Requires the jhead program.


       [-M]   Sort images by the file modification date, and then by the
              filename. Default sort if by name only.


       [-s subtitle_text]
              Add default subtitle "subtitle_text" to every slide.  Use "-s
              filename" to display filename as the subtitle.  Use "-s path" to
              display the path and filename as the subtitle.


       [-s2 subtitle_text]
              Same as -s but adds subtitles to subtitle track 2.


       [-b background.jpg]
              Use background.jpg as the background images.  Default is black.


       [-notitle]
              Do not create a title slide.


       [-r]   Recursively search directories for images, creating one output
              file.


       [-k]   Apply random kenburns effects to images. (use of this is
              discouraged because encoding takes so long)


       [-p]   Use PAL output video format instead of NTSC


       [-theme themename]
              Use themename as a theme file.  See theme help files for more
              info. (TBD)


       [-a audiofile1,audiofile2,...]
              Add audio files to the slideshow. Files will be played
              sequentially for the duration of the slideshow.  Use quotes if
              you have spaces in filenames.


       [-q]   Quiet mode: outputs less screen output.
