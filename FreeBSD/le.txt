LE(1)                   FreeBSD General Commands Manual                  LE(1)

NAME
       le - full screen text editor

SYNOPSIS
       le [options] filename

DESCRIPTION
       le is a text editor which offers wide range of capabilities with a
       simple interface. It has a pull down menu and a simple help system to
       get started. See KEYS section below to learn about key combinations.

       Among its features there are: various operations with stream and
       rectangular blocks, search and replace with full regular expressions,
       text formatting, undelete/uninsert, hex editing, tunable key sequences,
       tunable colors, tunable syntax highlighting.

       The editor currently supports only one loaded file at a time.


KEYS
       Here are some starting hints:

       F10 or C-n
              menu

       F1     help

       C-x    exit (cancel)

       Arrows navigate

       In the editor the following key description is used:

       Key1-Key2
              simultaneous key1 and key2 press

       Key1+Key2
              sequential keys press

       Key1 | Key2
              press Key1 OR Key2

       ^Key   Ctrl-Key

       ~Key   Shift-Key

       ^~Key  Ctrl-Shift-Key | Alt-Key

       Some of ^Fx, ~Fx, ^~Fx can be typed as ESC+Fx.

       The rest of key combinations can be seen in help, in menu and in the
       keyboard map (default one can be seen with le_--dump-keymap).

       There is support for block filtering through an external program, a
       command output read-in, writing a block through a command. To read or
       write block from/to a command, use F4+R or F4+W and file name of the
       following format: ``|command args''. Filtering is achieved by F4+|
       followed by command name.


STATUS LINE
       On the status line you can see current line, column, the size of loaded
       file, the code of character under cursor, several one letter flags,
       file name, offset in bytes from the file beginning and percent position
       in the file.

       One letters flags are: * - modified; R - Russian keyboard (works only
       on certain terminals); I - insert, O - overstrike; A - autoindent; D -
       dos style line terminators (CR NL); U - undelete possible, u - uninsert
       possible; B - column block mode.


TEXT PROTECTION
       To prevent changes loss on crash, le regularly dumps the editing text,
       if changed, to ~/.le/tmp/FILENAME.PID , where FILENAME is the file name
       with slashes converted to underlines; PID is the process id of the
       editor process.

       When the editor gets a fatal signal, it also dumps the text, to
       ~/.le/tmp/DUMP-SIG-FILENAME.PID , where SIG is the signal number.


OPTIONS
       -r, --read-only
              Work as viewer, don't allow changes. If your system supports
              mmap(2), it will be used to get file contents to memory.

       -h, --hex-mode
              Start in hex mode

       --mmap Use mmap(2) to load file read-only. Can be used to view very
              large files or even devices. This implies -h.

       --mmap-rw
              Use mmap(2) to load file read-write in MAP_SHARED mode. Use with
              caution -- the changes go directly to file or disk, no undo. In
              this mode only replace can be used, but it allows editing of
              very large files or even devices.  This implies -h.

       --multibyte
              Force multibyte mode on. Multibyte mode is usually enabled
              automatically as needed.

       --no-multibyte
              Force multibyte mode off, even if it was automatically
              determined that it should be on.

       -b, --black-white
              Start in black & white mode

       -c, --color
              Start in color mode

       --dump-keymap
              Dump default keymap to stdout and exit

       --dump-colors
              Dump default color map to stdout and exit

       --version
              Print the version of LE and exit

       --help Print short description of options and exit


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment variables are processed by le:

       HOME   Used for tilde (`~') expansion.

       LE_DEFAULT_EOL
              The default EOL marker. It can be set to NL (\n), CRNL (\r\n) or
              CR (\r).  Also it can be set to any other 1-2 character string
              interpreted literally.

       TERM, LINES, COLUMNS
              These variables are used by curses library for full-screen
              output.


FILES
       DATADIR/colors
       ~/.le/colors
       DATADIR/colors-$TERM
       ~/.le/colors-$TERM
              Color palette description. Those files are sequentially read and
              color definitions in later files have higher precision.

       ~/.le/keymap-$TERM
       DATADIR/keymap-$TERM
       ~/.le/keymap
       DATADIR/keymap
              Key map descriptions. Only the first existing file is read.

       ~/.le/term-$TERM
       DATADIR/term-$TERM
              Terminal specific options. Only the first existing file is read.
              Use Options->Terminal menu to tune the options.

       ./.le.ini
       ~/.le/le.ini
       DATADIR/le.ini
              Options. Only the first existing file is read. Use menu Options
              to tune these.

       .le.syntax
       ~/.le/syntax
       DATADIR/syntax
              Syntax highlighting rules.  Only the first existing file is
              read. There is no default built-in in the editor, so if those
              files are not present you won't see any syntax highlighting.

       ~/.le/mainmenu
       DATADIR/mainmenu
              Main editor menu. It has simple text format. Only the first
              existing file is read.

       ~/.le/history
              Various histories are saved here. Do not edit by hand.

       DATADIR is determined at compile time by configure script (pkgdatadir
       variable). By default it has value /usr/local/share/le.
