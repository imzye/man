Test::TAP::HTMLMatrix(3)                   User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Test::TAP::HTMLMatrix - Creates colorful matrix of Test::Harness
       friendly test run results using Test::TAP::Model.

SYNOPSIS
               use Test::TAP::HTMLMatrix;
               use Test::TAP::Model::Visual;

               my $model = Test::TAP::Model::Visual->new(...);

               my $v = Test::TAP::HTMLMatrix->new($model);

               print $v->html;

DESCRIPTION
       This module is a wrapper for a template and some visualization classes,
       that knows to take a Test::TAP::Model object, which encapsulates test
       results, and produce a pretty html file.

METHODS
       new (@models, $?extra)
           @model is at least one Test::TAP::Model object (or exactly one
           Test::TAP::Model::Consolidated) to extract results from, and the
           optional $?extra is a string to put in <pre></pre> at the top.

       html
           Deprecated method - aliases to "detail_html".

       detail_html
       summary_html
           Returns an HTML string for the corresponding template.

           This is also the method implementing stringification.

       model
       extra
       petal
           Just settergetters. You can override these for added fun.

       title
           A reasonable title for the page:

                   "TAP Matrix - <gmtime>"

       tests
           A sorted array ref, resulting from $self->model->test_files;

       detail_template
       summary_template
       css_file
           These return the full path to the Petal template and the CSS
           stylesheet it uses.

           Note that these are taken from @INC. If you put detailed_view.html
           under " catfile(qw/Test TAP HTMLMatrix/) " somewhere in your @INC,
           it should find it like you'd expect.

       css_uri
           This is a URI::file object based on "css_file". Nothing fancy.

           You probably want to override this to something more specific to
           your env.

       has_inline_css ?$new_value
           This accessor controls whether inline CSS will be generated instead
           of "<link>" style stylesheet refs.

       has_javascript $?new_value
           This accessor controls whether to generate a javascript enhanced or
           javascript free version of the reports.

       inline_css
           Returns the contents of "css_file" fudged slightly to work inside
           "<style>" tags.

       template_to_html $path
           Processes the said template using "process_petal".

       process_petal $petal
           Takes a petal object and processes it.

       no_javascript
           A predicate method used in the templates for checking if no
           javascript is desired. The opposite of "has_javascript".
