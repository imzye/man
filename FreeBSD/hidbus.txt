HIDBUS(4)              FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual              HIDBUS(4)

NAME
     hidbus – generic HID bus driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device hidbus
           device hid

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           hidbus_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The hidbus driver provides support for multiple HID driver attachments to
     single HID transport backend.  See iichid(4) or usbhid(4).

     Each HID device can have several components, e.g., a keyboard and a
     mouse.  These components use different report identifiers (a byte)
     combined into groups called collections to distinguish which one data is
     coming from.  The hidbus driver has other drivers attached that handle
     particular kinds of devices and hidbus broadcasts data to all of them.

SYSCTL VARIABLES
     The following variables are available as both sysctl(8) variables and
     loader(8) tunables:

     hw.hid.hidbus.debug
             Debug output level, where 0 is debugging disabled and larger
             values increase debug message verbosity.  Default is 0.
