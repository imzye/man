NAME
       Crypt::DES - Perl DES encryption module

SYNOPSIS
           use Crypt::DES;

DESCRIPTION
       The module implements the Crypt::CBC interface, which has the following
       methods

       blocksize =item keysize =item encrypt =item decrypt

FUNCTIONS
       blocksize
           Returns the size (in bytes) of the block cipher.

       keysize
           Returns the size (in bytes) of the key. Optimal size is 8 bytes.

       new
                   my $cipher = new Crypt::DES $key;

           This creates a new Crypt::DES BlockCipher object, using $key, where
           $key is a key of keysize() bytes.

       encrypt
                   my $cipher = new Crypt::DES $key;
                   my $ciphertext = $cipher->encrypt($plaintext);

           This function encrypts $plaintext and returns the $ciphertext where
           $plaintext and $ciphertext should be of blocksize() bytes.

       decrypt
                   my $cipher = new Crypt::DES $key;
                   my $plaintext = $cipher->decrypt($ciphertext);

           This function decrypts $ciphertext and returns the $plaintext where
           $plaintext and $ciphertext should be of blocksize() bytes.

EXAMPLE
               my $key = pack("H16", "0123456789ABCDEF");
               my $cipher = new Crypt::DES $key;
               my $ciphertext = $cipher->encrypt("plaintex");  # NB - 8 bytes
               print unpack("H16", $ciphertext), "\n";

NOTES
       Do note that DES only uses 8 byte keys and only works on 8 byte data
       blocks.  If you're intending to encrypt larger blocks or entire files,
       please use Crypt::CBC in conjunction with this module.  See the
       Crypt::CBC documentation for proper syntax and use.

       Also note that the DES algorithm is, by today's standard, weak
       encryption.  Crypt::Blowfish is highly recommended if you're interested
       in using strong encryption and a faster algorithm.
