NAME
     asa – interpret carriage-control characters

SYNOPSIS
     asa [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The asa utility reads files sequentially, mapping FORTRAN carriage-
     control characters to line-printer control sequences, and writes them to
     the standard output.

     The first character of each line is interpreted as a carriage-control
     character.  The following characters are interpreted as follows:

     ⟨space⟩    Output the rest of the line without change.

     0          Output a ⟨newline⟩ character before printing the rest of the
                line.

     1          Output a ⟨formfeed⟩ character before printing the rest of the
                line.

     +          The trailing ⟨newline⟩ of the previous line is replaced by a
                ⟨carriage-return⟩ before printing the rest of the line.

     Lines beginning with characters other than the above are treated as if
     they begin with ⟨space⟩.

EXIT STATUS
     The asa utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     To view a file containing the output of a FORTRAN program:

           asa file

     To format the output of a FORTRAN program and redirect it to a line-
     printer:

           a.out | asa | lpr

SEE ALSO
     f77(1)

STANDARDS
     The asa utility conforms to IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (“POSIX.1”).
