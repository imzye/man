DESCRIPTION
       nightfall is an interactive astronomy program for fun, education and
       science.  It can generate animated views of eclipsing (or non-
       eclipsing) binary stars, compute light curves and radial velocity
       curves, and determine best-fit models for observational data.

       In the simplest case, nightfall computes the light curve for a binary
       star system with some given mass_ratio (mass of secondary star/mass of
       primary star), inclination (0 = plane-on view, 90 = edge-on view of the
       orbital plane), stellar sizes primary_size,secondary_size
       (dimensionless, in the range 0 - 1.3), and stellar temperatures
       primary_temperature,secondary_temperature (in Kelvin), and writes the
       light curve to a file NightfallCurve.dat.

       nightfall is able to show many non-trivial, and sometimes spectacular,
       physical effecs in binary stars, as it uses a detailed physical model
       rather than simply assuming the stars to be spherical.

       The full documentation  for nightfall is distributed only in DVI and
       HTML format, as it is quite big,  and  thus  not very well suited to
       the 'man' page format.  It includes some discussion of binary stars (at
       a popular science level, hopefully) that you may find helpful in
       understanding what the program does.

OPTIONS
       -h     Print a usage message on standard output and exit successfully.

       -U     Run in interactive mode.

       -C file
              Use binary star parameters from a configuration file instead of
              giving them on the command line. Sample configuration files are
              in share/nightfall/cfg.

       -G[P|S|1|2]
              Plot a graph of the lightcurve after its computation (P|S - zoom
              on primary/secondary eclipse, 1|2 - plot 1/2 orbits).

       -A     Generate an animated view of the binary star.

       -V[v|i|c|a]
              Visualize the geometry of the binary star system (v - view of
              the stars, i - image of the potential, c - contour plot  of the
              potential, a - all of them).

       -H     Send plot to a postscript file. If the postscript file exists,
              it will be overwritten.

       -B[U|B|V|I|R|J|H|K|u|v|b|y|1|2]
              Select the filter/bandpass for which the lightcurve should be
              plotted.  U-K range from ultraviolett to infrared, best match to
              the human eye is V.  u-y are narrow-band filters.  1|2 will
              select radial velocity curves instead of a light curve.

       -fP/-fS value
              By default, nightfall assumes synchroneous  rotation, which
              means that the stars are rotating with the orbital period, and
              thus show each other always the same 'side'. With this option,
              you can set the ratio of stellar rotation frequency to orbital
              frequency to some value different from one, seperately for the
              primary P and the secondary S.

       -e eccentricity periastron_length
              By default, nightfall assumes the orbit to be circular. With
              this option, you can set the eccentricity of the orbit (0 is
              circular, maximum is less than 1), and the periastron length,
              which is the point of closest approach of the two stars in their
              orbit (0 - 360 degree).

       -sP/-sS longitude latitude radius dimfactor
              Place a spot on the primary (P) or secondary (S).  The spot
              parameters are the location of the spot (longitude,latitude),
              its radius, and the dimfactor by which the temperature is
              reduced (or increased) within the spot area.

       -tP/-tM/-tD value
              Set the absolute value for the orbital period P (in days), the
              total mass M (in units of solar masses), and/or the orbital
              separation D (in solar radii) of the system. Any two of these
              are independent, the third is then calculated from Kepler's laws
              (i.e., you should set only two of these).

       -I file
              Read in observational data from a data file.  Sample data files
              are in share/nightfall/data.

       -D[vwb]
              Diagnostic output (v - verbose, w - warnings, b - status
              messages).

NOTES
       The definition of primary/secondary is inverse to the usual convention
       in astronomy.

       Obviously, the size of a star in a binary system is limited by the
       orbital separation of the two stars. Instead of having to calculate the
       maximum useful stellar size herself, the user simply gives the desired
       stellar size as a fraction (0.001-1.3) of the maximum polar radius of
       the star (which is calculated by the program).  In the output file
       NightfallCurve.dat, you will then find the 'real' size of the star(s).

       If no absolute values for total mass and orbital period/separation are
       given, the program will use some default values (mass = two solar
       masses, orbital separation = distance earth-sun).  In this case,
       sizes/masses/velocities given in absolute units (e.g. kg, m, m/s, solar
       masses/radii) are fictuous only - they would be valid only for a system
       with the assumed default values of total mass and orbital separation.
