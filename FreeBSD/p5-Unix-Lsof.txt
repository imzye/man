NAME
       Unix::Lsof - Wrapper to the Unix lsof utility

VERSION
       This document describes Unix::Lsof version 0.1.0

SYNOPSIS
           use Unix::Lsof;
           my ($output,$error) = lsof("afile.txt");
           my @pids = keys %$output;
           my @commands = map { $_->{"command name"} } values %$output;

           ($output,$error) = lsof("-p",$$);
           my @filenames;
           for my $pid (keys %$output) {
               for my $files ( @{ $o->{$k}{files} } ) {
                   push @filenames,$f->{"file name"}
               }
           }

          my $lr = lsof ("-p",$$); # see Unix::Lsof::Result
          @filenames = $lrs->get_filenames();
          @inodes = $lrs->get_values("inode number");

          # With options
          my $lr = lsof ("-p",$$,{ binary => "/opt/bin/lsof" });

DESCRIPTION
       This module is a wrapper around the Unix lsof utility (written by
       Victor A.Abell, Copyright Purdue University), which lists open files as
       well as information about the files and processes opening them.
       "Unix::Lsof" uses the lsof binary, so you need to have that installed
       in order to use this module (lsof can be obtained from
       <ftp://lsof.itap.purdue.edu/pub/tools/unix/lsof>).

       By default, this module exports a single function "lsof", to which you
       can pass the same parameters you would the lsof binary. When called in
       list context, "lsof" will return two values, a hash reference
       containing the parsed output of the lsof binary and a string containing
       (unparsed) any error messages. When called in scalar context, "lsof"
       will return a "Unix::Lsof::Result" object (see the documentation for
       that module for further details).

       On request, you can also export the subroutine "parse_lsof_output"
       which will do what the name says and return the parsed output. Both of
       these support a number of options, passed in as a hash reference as the
       last argument (see section "OPTIONS" below).

INTERFACE
   Subroutines
       lsof
            lsof ();
            lsof ( @lsof_arguments );
            lsof ( @lsof_arguments, \%options );

           "lsof" accepts arguments passed on to the lsof binary. These need
           to be in list form, so you need to do

               $r = lsof("-p",$pid,"-a","+D","/tmp");

           NOT

               $r = lsof("-p $pid -a +D /tmp");

           SCALAR CONTEXT

           Example:

               $lr = lsof("afile");

           When called in scalar context, "lsof" will return a
           "Unix::Lsof::Result" object. Please see the documentation for that
           module on how to use this object.  I mean it, really, take a look
           there, you'll almost certainly want to use the "Unix::Lsof::Result"
           interface which gives you lots of helper methods to dig out exactly
           the information you want.

           LIST CONTEXT

           Example:

               ($output,$error) = lsof("afile");

           When called in list context, "lsof" will return two values, a hash
           reference containing the parsed output of the lsof binary, and a
           string containing any error messages. The output data structure
           looks like this (approximating "Data::Dumper" formatting here:)

              $output = {
                          '<pid>' => {
                                       '<process field name>' => '<value>',
                                       '<process field name>' => '<value>',
                                       'files' => [
                                                    {
                                                      '<file field name>' => '<value>',
                                                      '<file field name>' => '<value>'
                                                    },
                                                    {
                                                      '<file field name>' => '<value>',
                                                      '<file field name>' => '<value>'
                                                           ...
                                                    },
                                                  ]
                                     }
                             ...
                        }

           Each process id (pid) is the key to a hash reference that contains
           as keys the names of process set fields and their corresponding
           field value. The special "files" key has an array reference as
           value. Each element in this array is a hash reference that contains
           the names of file set fields and their values. See the section
           OUTPUT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS in the lsof manpage if you're wondering
           what process and file sets are.

           Process field names are:

               "command name"
               "login name"
               "process id"
               "process group id"
               "parent pid"
               "task id"
               "user id"

           File field names are:

               "access mode"
               "structure share count"
               "device character code"
               "major/minor device number"
               "file descriptor"
               "structure address"
               "flags"
               "inode number"
               "link count"
               "lock status"
               "file name"
               "node identifier"
               "file offset"
               "protocol name"
               "raw device number"
               "file size"
               "stream module and device names"
               "file type"
               "tcp/tpi info"
               "user id"
               "zone name"
               "selinux security context"

           Special mention needs to be made of the field "tcp/tpi info", since
           that will contain a list of information. Therefore, the value for
           this field is itself a hash reference. The keys of this hash are
           the long names of the information, as given in the lsof man page,
           the information names are:

               "read queue size"
               "send queue size"
               "socket options and values"
               "socket states"
               "connection state"
               "TCP flags and values"
               "window read size"
               "window write size"

           Note that not all of this information is available on every
           dialect, see the lsof man page for more.

       parse_lsof_output ( <STRING> )
           This function takes the output as obtained from the lsof binary
           (with the -F0 option) and parses it into the data structure
           explained above. You need to pass the lsof STDOUT output in as a
           single string. Previous behaviour (passing the output as an array
           reference with one line of output per array element) is deprecated
           as of Unix::Lsof version 0.0.8 and may not work in future releases.
           "parse_lsof_output" does not understand the lsof STDERR output.

       OPTIONS
           You can (optionally) pass in a hash reference as the last argument
           to either "lsof" or "parse_lsof_output". This reference can contain
           the following options:

       binary  Contains the path of the lsof binary. Use this if lsof is not
               in your $ENV{PATH}.

       suppress_errors
               Default false. If set to 1, Unix::Lsof subroutines will not
               emit any warning messages and will not die on a fatal error.
               Diagnostics suppressed in this way can be found in $err (and
               $UNIX::Lsof::Result->err()).

       tcp_tpi_parse
               See the above section on "tcp/tpi info". Possible values:

               "full"

               Default. Parses out the tcptpi information and uses the long
               names as hash keys.

               "part"

               Also parses out the information, but uses the short names (e.g.
               QS for "send queue size") as keys.

               "array"

               Returns an array reference instead of a hash, each element of
               the array contains an unparsed TCP/TPI information (e.g.
               "QS=0").

DIAGNOSTICS
       "Cannot find lsof program"
           Couldn't find the lsof binary which is required to use this module.
           Either install lsof or (if it's installed) be sure that it is in
           your shells path.

       "Can't parse line"
           Encountered a line of lsof output which could not be properly
           parsed. If you get this from calling lsof() it is almost certainly
           a bug, please let me know so I can fix it. If you encountered it
           from running "parse_lsof_output", please make sure that the output
           was obtained from running lsof with the -F0 option.

       "Adding results of this line to process set for PID %s"
           Appears in conjunction with the "invalid field identifier" warning
           and show that the incorrect output was encountered in a process
           set.

       "Adding results of this line to file set line"
           Appears in conjunction with the "invalid field identifier" warning
           and show that the incorrect output was encountered in a field set.

       "Previous record neither a process nor file set, identifier was "%s""
           Appears in conjunction with the "invalid field identifier" warning,
           something else has gone wrong and we were unable to work around it.
           Please send a bug report to "bug-unix-lsof@rt.cpan.org".

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
       Unix::Lsof requires no configuration files. It searches for the lsof
       binary in the directories listed in your $PATH environment variable.

DEPENDENCIES
       Unix::Lsof requires the following modules:

       •   version

       •   IPC::Run3

INCOMPATIBILITIES
       None reported.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       Please report any bugs or feature requests to
       "bug-unix-lsof@rt.cpan.org", or through the web interface at
       <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=Unix-Lsof>.

       No bugs have been reported so far. There are a number of improvements
       that could be made to this module, particularly in the handling of
       parameters. Further development is almost certainly strictly "develop
       by bugreport", so if you want a feature added, please open a wishlist
       item in the RT web interface and let me know. I'm more than happy to do
       more work on this module, but want to see what concrete improvements
       people would like to have. As always, patches are more than welcome.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
       A very heartfelt thanks to Vic Abell for writing "lsof", it has been
       invaluable to me over the years. Many thanks as always to
       http://www.perlmonks.org, the monks continue to amaze and enlighten me.
       A very special thanks to Damian Conway, who (amongst other things)
       recommends writing module documentation at the same time as code (in
       his excellent book "Perl Best Practices"). I didn't follow that advice
       and as a result writing these docs was more painful and error-prone
       than it should have been. Please Mr. Conway, for the next edition could
       you put more emphasis on that recommendation so that dolts like me get
       it the first time?
