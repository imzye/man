NAME
       SVK - A Distributed Version Control System

SYNOPSIS
         use SVK;
         use SVK::XD;
         $xd = SVK::XD->new (depotmap => { '' => '/path/to/repos'});

         $svk = SVK->new (xd => $xd, output => \$output);
         # serialize the $xd object for future use.

         $svk->ls ('//'); # check $output for its output
         ...

DESCRIPTION
       "SVK" is the class that loads SVK::Command and invokes them. You can
       use it in your program to do what you do with the svk command line
       interface.

CONSTRUCTOR
       Options to "new":

       xd  SVK::XD object that handles depot and checkout copy mapping.

       output
           A scalar reference. After command invocation the output will be
           stored in the scalar. By default the output is not held in any
           scalar and will be printed to STDOUT.

METHODS
       All methods are autoloaded and deferred to "SVK::Command->invoke".

SEE ALSO
       svk, SVK::XD, SVK::Command.
