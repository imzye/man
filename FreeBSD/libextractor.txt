EXTRACT(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             EXTRACT(1)



NAME
       extract - determine meta-information about a file

SYNOPSIS
       extract [ -bgihLmnvV ] [ -l library ] [ -p type ] [ -x type ] file ...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents version 1.0.0 of the extract command.

       extract tests each file specified in the argument list in an attempt to
       infer meta-information from it.  Each file is subjected to the
       meta-data extraction libraries from libextractor.

       libextractor classifies meta-information (also referred to as keywords)
       into types. A list of all types can be obtained with the -L option.


OPTIONS
       -b      Display the output in BiBTeX format.

       -g      Use grep-friendly output (all keywords on a single line for
               each file).  Use the verbose option to print the filename
               first, followed by the keywords.  Use the verbose option twice
               to also display the keyword types.  This option will not print
               keyword types or non-textual metadata.

       -h      Print a brief summary of the options.

       -i      Run plugins in-process (for debugging).  By default, each
               plugin is run in its own process.

       -l libraries
               Use the specified libraries to extract keywords. The general
               format of libraries is .I [[-]LIBRARYNAME[:[-]LIBRARYNAME]*]
               where LIBRARYNAME is a libextractor compatible library and
               typically of the form .Ijpeg. The minus before the libraryname
               indicates that this library should be removed from the existing
               list.  To run only a few selected plugins, use -l in
               combination with -n.

       -L      Print a list of all known keyword types.

       -m      Load the file into memory and perform extraction from memory
               (for debugging).

       -n      Do not use the default set of extractors (typically all
               standard extractors, currently mp3, ogg, jpg, gif, png, tiff,
               real, html, pdf and mime-types), use only the extractors
               specified with the .B -l option.

       -p  type
               Print only the keywords matching the specified type. By
               default, all keywords that are found and not removed as
               duplicates are printed.

       -v      Print the version number and exit.

       -V      Be verbose.  This option can be specified multiple times to
               increase verbosity further.

       -x  type
               Exclude keywords of the specified type from the output. By
               default, all keywords that are found and not removed as
               duplicates are printed.
