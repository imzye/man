NAME
          Lynis - System and security auditing tool

SYNOPSIS

       lynis [scan mode] [other options]

DESCRIPTION
       Lynis is a security auditing tool for Linux, macOS, and other systems
       based on UNIX. The tool checks the system and the software
       configuration, to see if there is any room for improvement the security
       defenses. All details are stored in a log file. Findings and other
       discovered data is stored in a report file.  This can be used to
       compare differences between audits. Lynis can run interactively or as a
       cronjob. Root permissions (e.g. sudo) are not required, however provide
       more details during the audit.

       The following system areas may be checked:

              - Boot loader files

              - Configuration files

              - Software packages

              - Directories and files related to logging and auditing



FIRST TIME USAGE
       When running Lynis for the first time, run: lynis audit system


COMMANDS
       audit <type>
              Perform an audit of the selected type

       upload-only
              Upload the available report data file

              See HELPERS section for more commands.


SCAN TYPES
       audit system
              Performs a system audit, which is the most common audit.

       audit system remote <host>
              Provide commands to do a remote scan.

       For more scan modes, see the helper utilities.


OPTIONS
       --auditor <name>
              Define the name of the auditor/pentester. When a full name is
              used, add double quotes, like "Your Name".

       --cronjob
              Perform automatic scan with cron safe options (no colors, no
              questions, no breaks).

       --debug
              Display debug information to screen for troubleshooting
              purposes.

       --developer
              Display detailed information useful for developers when creating
              tests.

       --forensics
              Perform the audit on a running or mounted system (see --rootdir)

       --help Show available commands and most-used options.

       --logfile </path/to/logfile>
              Defines location and name of log file, instead of default
              /var/log/lynis.log.

       --man  Show the man page. Useful for systems that do not have the man
              page installed.

       --no-colors
              Disable colored output.

       --no-log
              Redirect all logging information to /dev/null, prevents
              sensitive information to be written to disk.

       --no-plugins
              Do not run any of the enabled plugins.

       --pentest
              Run a non-privileged scan, usually used for penetration testing.
              Some of the tests will be skipped if they require root
              permissions.

       --plugin-dir </path/to/plugins>
              Define location where plugins can be found.

       --profile <file>
              Provide alternative profile to perform the scan.

       --quick (-Q)
              Do a quick scan (default: don't wait for user input).

       --quiet (-q)
              Run quietly and do not show anything to the screen. Will also
              enable quick mode.

       --report-file <file>
              Provide an alternative name for report file.

       --reverse-colors
              Optimize screen output for light backgrounds.

       --tests TEST-IDs
              Only run the specific test(s). When using multiple tests, add
              quotes around the line.

       --tests-from-category <category>
              Tests are only performed if they belong to the defined category.
              Use the command  'show categories' to determine all valid
              options.

       --tests-from-group <group>
              Similar to --tests-from-category. Only perform tests from a
              particular group.  Use 'show groups' to determine valid options.

       --use-cwd
              Run from the current working directory.

       --upload
              Upload data to Lynis Enterprise server (profile option:
              upload=yes).

       --verbose
              Show more details on screen, such as components that could not
              found. These details are hidden by default.

       --wait Wait for user to continue. This adds a break after each section
              (opposed of --quick).

       --warnings-only
              Run quietly, except show warnings.

              Multiple parameters are allowed, though some parameters can only
              be used together with others. When running Lynis without any
              parameters, help will be shown and the program will exit.

HELPERS
       Lynis has special helpers to do certain tasks. This way the framework
       of Lynis is used, while at the same time storing most of the
       functionality in a separated file. This speeds up execution and keeps
       the code clean.


       audit  Run audit on the system or on other targets

       configure <parameter>
              Change or add settings to the config file

       generate <parameter>
              Generate specific details such as host IDs

       show <parameter>
              Show information, such as configuration and paths

       update <parameter>
              Perform activities regarding updating

       To use a helper, run 'lynis' followed by the helper name.


EXIT CODES
       Lynis uses exit codes to signal any invoking script. Currently the
       following codes are used:

       0      Program exited normally

       1      Fatal error

       64     An unknown parameter is used, or incomplete

       65     Incorrect data encountered

       66     Can't open file or directory

       78     Lynis found 1 or more warnings or configurations errors (with
              error-on-warnings=yes)
