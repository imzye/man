QUERYLOCALE(3)         FreeBSD Library Functions Manual         QUERYLOCALE(3)

NAME
     querylocale – Look up the locale name or version for a specified category

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <locale.h>

     const char *
     querylocale(int mask, locale_t locale);

DESCRIPTION
     Returns the name or version of the locale for the category specified by
     mask.  The possible values for the mask are the same as those in
     newlocale(3), when requesting the locale name.  Specify the bitwise OR of
     LC_VERSION_MASK and another mask value to request a version string.
     Version strings can be compared to detect changes to the locale's
     definition.  The structure of the version string is unspecified.
     Currently, version information is only available for LC_COLLATE_MASK, and
     an empty string is returned for other categories.  If more than one bit
     in the mask is set, not counting LC_VERSION_MASK, the returned value is
     undefined.

HISTORY
     The querylocale() function first appeared in FreeBSD 9.1, and is based on
     the function of the same name in Darwin.  LC_VERSION_MASK first appeared
     in FreeBSD 13.0.
