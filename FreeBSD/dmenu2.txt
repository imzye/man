       dmenu2_run ...

DESCRIPTION
       dmenu2 is a dynamic menu for X, which reads a list of newline-separated
       items from stdin.  When the user selects an item and presses Return,
       their choice is printed to stdout and dmenu2 terminates.  Entering text
       will narrow the items to those matching the tokens in the input.

       dmenu2_run is a script used by dwm(1) which lists programs in the
       user's $PATH and runs the result in their $SHELL.

OPTIONS
       -b     dmenu2 appears at the bottom of the screen.

       -q     dmenu2 will not show any items if the search string is empty.

       -f     dmenu2 grabs the keyboard before reading stdin.  This is faster,
              but will lock up X until stdin reaches end-of-file.

       -r     activates filter mode. All matching items currently shown in the
              list will be selected, starting with the item that is
              highlighted and wrapping around to the beginning of the list.

       -i     dmenu2 matches menu items case insensitively.

       -z     dmenu2 uses fuzzy matching. It matches items that have all
              characters entered, in sequence they are entered, but there may
              be any number of characters between matched characters.  For
              example it takes "txt" makes it to "*t*x*t" glob pattern and
              checks if it matches.

       -t     dmenu2 uses space-separated tokens to match menu items. Using
              this overrides -z option.

       -mask  dmenu2 masks input with asterisk characters (*).

       -noinput
              dmenu2 ignores input from stdin (equivalent to: echo | dmenu2).

       -s screen
              dmenu2 apears on the specified screen number. Number given
              corespondes to screen number in X configuration.

       -name name
              defines window name for dmenu2. Defaults to "dmenu2".

       -class class
              defines window class for dmenu2. Defaults to "Dmenu2".

       -o opacity
              defines window opacity for dmenu2. Defaults to 1.0.

       -dim opacity
              enables screen dimming when dmenu2 appers. Takes dim opacity as
              argument.

       -dc color
              defines color of screen dimming. Active only when -dim in
              effect. Defautls to black (#000000)

       -l lines
              dmenu2 lists items vertically, with the given number of lines.

       -h height
              defines the height of the bar in pixels.

       -uh height
              defines the height of the underline in pixels.

       -p prompt
              defines the prompt to be displayed to the left of the input
              field.

       -fn font
              defines the font or font set used. eg. "fixed" or
              "Monospace-12:normal" (an xft font)

       -x xoffset
              defines the offset from the left border of the screen.

       -y yoffset
              defines the offset from the top border of the screen.

       -w width
              defines the desired menu window width.

       -nb color
              defines the normal background color.  #RGB, #RRGGBB, and X color
              names are supported.

              the file to use for history

       -v     prints version information to stdout, then exits.
