NAME
       seaview - a multiplatform, graphical user interface for multiple
       sequence alignment and molecular phylogeny.

SYNOPSIS
       seaview [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       seaview is the program that starts the SeaView GUI.

       SeaView is a graphical interface for multiple sequence alignment and
       molecular phylogeny. It is able to read various alignment formats (MSF,
       CLUSTAL, FASTA, PHYLIP, MASE, NEXUS) and the Newick tree format, and
       allows one to manually edit the alignment, to run DOT-PLOT, CLUSTAL or
       MUSCLE programs to locally improve the alignment, and also to compute,
       draw and edit phylogenetic trees.

       If started from the command line with filename as an argument, seaview
       will open the alignment or tree stored in filename and display/draw it
       on screen. Filename can be in any of the mase, clustal, phylip, msf,
       fasta, or nexus alignment formats or in the Newick tree format.

OPTIONS
       -fast
           Suppresses double buffering for display. This should only
           accelerate display on very slow systems.

       -fontsize n
           Sets the font size to n.

FILES
       $HOME/.seaviewrc holds the user´s configuration for SeaView.

SEE ALSO
       The program is fully documented online. Press the "help" button in the
       main window. On Debian systems, the text template for SeaView´s help
       can be found in /usr/share/doc/seaview/seaview.html.

       Two multiple alignment programs can be called from whithin SeaView:
       muscle(1) and clustalw(1).

       SeaView usees some components of the PHYLIP package, see
