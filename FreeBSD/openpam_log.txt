OPENPAM_LOG(3)         FreeBSD Library Functions Manual         OPENPAM_LOG(3)

NAME
     openpam_log – log a message through syslog

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <security/pam_appl.h>
     #include <security/openpam.h>

     void
     openpam_log(int level, const char *fmt, ...);

DESCRIPTION
     The openpam_log() function logs messages using syslog(3).  It is
     primarily intended for internal use by the library and modules.

     The level argument indicates the importance of the message.  The
     following levels are defined:

     PAM_LOG_LIBDEBUG    Debugging messages.  For internal use only.

     PAM_LOG_DEBUG       Debugging messages.  These messages are normally not
                         logged unless the global integer variable
                         openpam_debug is set to a non-zero value, in which
                         case they are logged with a syslog(3) priority of
                         LOG_DEBUG.

     PAM_LOG_VERBOSE     Information about the progress of the authentication
                         process, or other non-essential messages.  These
                         messages are logged with a syslog(3) priority of
                         LOG_INFO.

     PAM_LOG_NOTICE      Messages relating to non-fatal errors.  These
                         messages are logged with a syslog(3) priority of
                         LOG_NOTICE.

     PAM_LOG_ERROR       Messages relating to serious errors.  These messages
                         are logged with a syslog(3) priority of LOG_ERR.

     The remaining arguments are a printf(3) format string and the
     corresponding arguments.

     The openpam_log() function does not modify the value of errno.
