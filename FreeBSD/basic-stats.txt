       basic-stats - Command-line statistics made trivial




SYNOPSIS
       basic-stats z-score x mean stddev
       basic-stats z-cdf z-score [mean stddev] (defaults: 0 1)
       basic-stats t-score x-bar expected-mean stddev n

       basic-stats [--verbose] [--delim string] \
                function1 [param1] --row|--col N \
                [function2 ...]


OPTIONS
       --verbose
              Echo input data during processing


       --delim string
              Use string as a set of delimiters instead of the default " \t"


       --row N
              Compute statistics for row N (1-based) of the input


       --col N
              Compute statistics for column N (1-based) of the input


       mean --row|--col N
              Compute the mean (average) for row/column N


       quantile partitions --row|--col N
              Compute the low, high, and quantiles for row/column N


       median --row|--col N
              Compute the low, high, and median for row/column N.  Identical
              to quantile 2 --row|--col N.


       quartile --row|--col N
              Identical to quantile 4 --row|--col N.


       pop-var --row|--col N
              Report population variance


       pop-stddev --row|--col N
              Report population standard deviation


       pop-z-scores --row|--col N
              Report population z-scores


       sample-var --row|--col N
              Report sample variance


       sample-stddev --row|--col N
              Report sample standard deviation


       sample-z-scores --row|--col N
              Report sample z-scores.  Should only be used for sample sizes of
              30 or more.  Otherwise, use sample-t-score.


       sample-stderr --row|--col N
              Report sample standard error (sigma-x-bar = stddev / sqrt(n))


       sample-t-score --row|--col N
              Report t-score for sample data.


       mode --row|--col N
              Report mode


       range --row|--col N
              Report range


       iq-range --row|--col N
              Report interquartile range


PURPOSE
       Basic-stats is a program for quickly computing statistics on tabular
       data from the command-line.  It elimintes the nuisance of importing
       data into a spreadsheet or writing custom scripts in order to gather
       basic statistics.


DESCRIPTION
       Basic-stats computes common statistics such as mean, median, etc. on
       rows and/or columns of tabular data.  It can compute multiple functions
       on multiple rows and/or columns in a single pass through the input
       stream.

       The default delimiter is either a single TAB or multiple space
       characters.  Alternate delimiters, such as a comma, can be specified
       using, e.g.  --delim ','.

       Quantiles are computed using a generalized interpolation formula
       (method 4 from the Wikipedia page on quartiles).

       The output format is designed to be both human-readable and easily
       parsed by command-line tools and scripts.

       Basic-stats is written entirely in C for maximal performance. Memory
       use is trivial for many functions, but some computations such as
       quantiles which involve sorting the data require the use of arrays.


EXAMPLES
       > cat sample.txt
       1    5  21
       2   12  22
       3   13  23
       4   14  24
       5   15  25
       6   16  26
       7   17  27
       8   18  28
       9   19  29
       10  20  30
       > basic-stats mean --col 1 median --row 2 quantile 4 --col 3 < sample.txt
       Col 1 mean           5.500000
       Row 2 low            2.000000
       Row 2 quantile(0.50) 12.000000
       Row 2 high           22.000000
       Col 3 low            21.000000
