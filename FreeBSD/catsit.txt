CATSIT-TIMER(1)         FreeBSD General Commands Manual        CATSIT-TIMER(1)

NAME
     catsit-timer – run command at interval

SYNOPSIS
     catsit-timer interval command ...

DESCRIPTION
     The catsit-timer utility runs a command at an interval.  The command is
     run once immediately, then again every interval after waiting for the
     command to exit each time.  The catsit-timer utility is not appropriate
     for scheduling commands to run at specific times.

     The format of the interval specifier is a series of integers followed by
     units: s for seconds, m for minutes and h for hours.  An integer with no
     unit is assumed to be in seconds.  The interval is the sum of each
     integer-unit pair.  For example, 1m30s is equivalent to 90s.

EXIT STATUS
     If the command exits non-zero, catsit-timer exits with the same status.
