VM_FAULT_PREFAULT(9)   FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual  VM_FAULT_PREFAULT(9)

NAME
     vm_fault_prefault – cluster page faults into a process's address space

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <vm/vm.h>
     #include <vm/pmap.h>

     void
     vm_fault_prefault(pmap_t pmap, vm_offset_t addra, vm_map_entry_t entry);

DESCRIPTION
     The vm_fault_prefault() function provides a means of clustering
     pagefaults into a process's address space.  It operates upon the physical
     map pmap.  The entry argument specifies the entry to be prefaulted; the
     addra argument specifies the beginning of the mapping in the process's
     virtual address space.

     It is typically called by vm_fault() after the first page fault.  It
     benefits the execve(2) system call by eliminating repetitive calls to
     vm_fault(), which would otherwise be made to bring the process's
     executable pages into physical memory.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
     This is a machine-independent function which calls the machine-dependent
     pmap_is_prefaultable(9) helper function to determine if a page may be
     prefaulted into physical memory.
