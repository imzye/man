NAME
     resettodr – set battery-backed clock from system time

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/systm.h>

     void
     resettodr(void);

DESCRIPTION
     The resettodr() function sets the system's battery-backed clock based on
     the contents of the system time variable.

SEE ALSO
     inittodr(9), time(9)

BUGS
     On many systems, resettodr() has to convert from time to a time expressed
     in terms of year, month, day, hours, minutes, and seconds.  Many of the
     implementations could share code, but do not.
