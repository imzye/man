columnt(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             columnt(1)

NAME
       columnt - align columns in a table

SYNTAX
       columnt

DESCRIPTION
       columnt reads a table of whitespace-separated lines.

       columnt then prints the table, changing the spacing so that the first
       column takes the same amount of space in every line, the second column
       takes the same amount of space in every line, etc.

       In the columnt output, all columns except the last are right-justified;
       the last column is left-justified.  There are two spaces between
       adjacent columns.

       columnt needs enough memory to read the entire input.  Other than this,
       it has no limits on line length or on the number of columns.
