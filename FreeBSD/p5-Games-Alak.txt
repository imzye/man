NAME
       Games::Alak -- simple game-tree implementation of a gomoku-like game

SYNOPSIS
         % perl -MGames::Alak -e Games::Alak::play
          ...Or just run Alak.pm as if it were a program...
          ...Program responds with output, and a prompt:

         Lookahead set to 3.  I am X, you are O.
         Enter h for help
         X moves from 1 to 5, yielding .xxxx..oooo
         alak>
          ...and now you enter the commands to play.

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements a simple game-tree system for the computer to
       play against the user in a game of Alak.  You can just play the game
       for fun; or you can use this module as a starting point for
       understanding game trees (and implementing smarter strategy -- the
       module's current logic is fairly simple-minded), particularly after
       reading my Perl Journal #18 article on trees, which discusses this
       module's implementation of game trees as an example of general tree-
       shaped data structures.

RULES
       Alak was invented by the mathematician A. K.  Dewdney, and described in
       his 1984 book Planiverse. The rules of Alak are simple -- at least as
       I've (mis?)understood them and implemented them here:

       * Alak is a two-player game played on a one-dimensional board with
       eleven slots on it.  Each slot can hold at most one piece at a time.
       There's two kinds of pieces, which I represent here as "x" and "o" --
       x's belong to one player (called X -- that's the computer), o's to the
       other (called O -- that's you).

       * The initial configuration of the board is:

          xxxx___oooo

       For sake of reference, the slots are numbered from 1 (on the left) to
       11 (on the right), and X always has the first move.

       * The players take turns moving.  At each turn, each player can move
       only one piece, once.  (This is unlike checkers, where you move one
       piece per move but get to keep moving it if you jump an your opponent's
       piece.) A player cannot pass up on his turn.  A player can move any one
       of his pieces to the next unoccupied slot to its right or left, which
       may involve jumping over occupied slots.  A player cannot move a piece
       off the side of the board.

       * If a move creates a pattern where the opponent's pieces are
       surrounded, on both sides, by two pieces of the mover's color (with no
       intervening unoccupied blank slot), then those surrounded pieces are
       removed from the board.

       * The goal of the game is to remove all of your opponent's pieces, at
       which point the game ends.  Removing all-but-one ends the game as well,
       since the opponent can't surround you with one piece, and so will
       always lose within a few moves anyway.

SAMPLE GAME
       A game between X (computer) and a particularly dim O (human):

         xxxx___oooo
           ^         Move 1: X moves from 3 (shown with caret) to 5
                      (Note that any of X's pieces could move, but
                      that the only place they could move to is 5.)
         xx_xx__oooo
                 ^   Move 2: O moves from 9 to 7.
         xx_xx_oo_oo
            ^        Move 3: X moves from 4 to 6.
         xx__xxoo_oo
                  ^  Move 4: O (stupidly) moves from 10 to 9.
         xx__xxooo_o
             ^       Move 5: X moves from 5 to 10, making the board
                     "xx___xoooxo".  The three o's that X just
                     surrounded are removed.
         xx___x___xo
                     O has only one piece, so has lost.

INTERFACE
       This module uses "Term::ReadLine" to give you a prompt at which you can
       type commands.

       Entering "h" for help at that prompt will give instructions on how to
       interact with the game.

       When in doubt, consult the source -- it's made to be fairly clear.
