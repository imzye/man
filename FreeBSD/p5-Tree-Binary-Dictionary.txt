Tree::Binary::Dictionary(3)                User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Tree::Binary::Dictionary - A dictionary API to a binary tree

DESCRIPTION
       A simple class to provide a dictionary style API to a binary tree of
       data.

       This can provide a useful alternative to a long-lived hash in long
       running daemons and processes.

SYNOPSIS
       use Tree::Binary::Dictionary;

       my $dictionary = Tree::Binary::Dictionary->new;

       # populate $dictionary->add(aaaa => "One"); $dictionary->add(cccc =>
       "Three"); $dictionary->add(dddd => "Four"); $dictionary->add(eeee =>
       "Five"); $dictionary->add(foo => "Foo"); $dictionary->add(bar =>
       "quuz");

       # interact $dictionary->exists('bar'); $dictionary->get('eeee');
       $dictionary->delete('cccc');

       # hash stuff my %hash = $dictionary->to_hash; my @values =
       $dictionary->values; my @keys = $dictionary->keys;

       # for long running processes $dictionary->rebuild();

METHODS
   new - constructor
       my $dictionary = Tree::Binary::Dictionary->new (cache => 0);

       Instantiates and returns a new dictionary object.

       Optional arguments are cache, which will re-use internal objects and
       structures rather than rebuilding them as required. Default is 1 /
       True.

   rebuild
       $dictionary->rebuild();

       Rebuilds the internal binary tree to reduce wasteful memory use

   add
       my $added = $dictionary->add(bar => "quuz");

       Adds new key and value in dictionary object, returns true on success,
       warns and returns 0 on duplicate key or other failure.

   set
       my $set = $dictionary->set(bar => 'quuuz');

       Sets key and value in dictionary object, returns true on success, 0 on
       error.

       This will add a new key and value if the key is new, or update the
       value of an existing key

   exists
       $dictionary->exists('bar');

   get
       my $value = $dictionary->get('eeee');

   delete
       my $deleted = $dictionary->delete('cccc');

   to_hash
       my %hash = $dictionary->to_hash;

       returns a hash populated from the dictionary

   values
       my @values = $dictionary->values;

       returns dictionary values as an array

   keys
       my @keys = $dictionary->keys;

       returns dictionary keys as an array

   count
       my $count = $dictionary->count

       returns the number of entries in the dictionary
