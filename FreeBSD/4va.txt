DESCRIPTION
       4va is a fourth dimensional visualization program for X-Windows. It
       takes as input a file describing an object in up to 4 dimensions and
       tumbles it in a window according to rotation values given on the
       command line.

   Options
       -xy, -xz, -yz, -xw, -yw, -zw <angle>
              Specify the amount of rotation each cycle in each of the 6
              planes (x-y, x-z, and so on). The angle is given in degrees and
              appended directly to the option, as in -xw4.5.  If any of these
              options are set on the command line, the defaults are cleared.
              The defaults are -xz0.6, -xw0.6, and -yw0.45.

       -np    Tell 4va not to do perspective. Normally perspective is done on
              both the z and w axes.

       -ns    Don't rescale the object in the window if the window is resized.
              Normally, if the window is resized, the object is rescaled in
              proportion to the new window size. Specifying -ns turns this
              off.

       -nt    Don't set a name for the title bar. On some window managers,
              this will suppress a title bar even being displayed on the
              window.

       -cw    Tell 4va to clear the window each cycle with a call to
              XClearWindow() instead of drawing over the old object in the
              background color. Using -cw is nice for larger objects, but for
              smaller objects letting 4va draw over the lines is faster and
              doesn't flicker.

       -zd <dist>, -wd <dist>
              Specify the viewer's distance, in pixels, along the z and w axes
              for perspective purposes. Naturally this doesn't have much
              meaning if -np is specified. The default is 430.0. Place the
              number directly after the switch, as in -zd400.0.

       -lc <color>, -bc <color>
              Specify the names of the foreground (line) and background
              colors, as in -lc LightGreen. The defaults are black background
              with red lines.

       -lw <width>
              Specify the width of the object's lines, in pixels. The default
              is a width of 0, which is the hardware-defined fastest line.
              Example is -lw5.

       -d <display>
              Specify the display name. 4va first checks the -d switch, then
              the DISPLAY environment variable, then then defaults to the
              display unix:0.

       -s <scale>
              Specify the scaling factor for all four dimensions, as in
              -s150.0.  The default is 200.0.

   Ctorus, cutctorus, and 4vdmake options
       These three programs are object file generators for 4va.  Ctorus
       generates a Clifford Torus with the densities named. For example,
       ctorus 20 20 will generate a Clifford Torus file with 20 increments
       around each of the two sets of circles defining the torus (the x-y set
       and the z-w set).

       Cutctorus is the same as ctorus, except that all of the circles in one
       direction are invisible, making the torus easier to see.

       4vdmake is a "customizable" object generation program that produces
       objects in three dimensions. The program generates a grid of points and
       lines on the x and y plane and applies to them a function (defined in
       the code) for the z value of each coordinate. This is a quick hack to
       let 4va display 3D functions. It can easily be modified to generate 4D
       functions.  4vdmake fits the grid (with the density on the x and y axes
       given on the command line) into a -1 to 1 square on the x and y axes.

   Object files
       Object files (usually with the extension .4vd) have the following
       format:

              p={ number-of-points }

              <points...>

              l={ number-of-lines }

              <lines...>

              n=name-of-object


       For example, a simple object file for a single line might look like

              p={2}
              1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0
              -1.0 -1.0 -1.0 -1.0
              l={1}
              0 1
              n=StupidLine

       If the number-of-points and number-of-lines do not match the number of
       points and lines in their sections, 4va will read the incorrect amount
       of data from the object file and will get confused.  As you can see,
       each point specifies the x, y, z, and w coordinates as floating-point
       numbers. If you're only creating a 3D object, for example, you can set
       all the w values to 0.0. Each line specifies the points between which
       the line extends. In the above example, we have one line between point
       0 and point 1 (notice that numbering starts with 0).


NOTES
       4va allocates memory for objects dynamically. If 4va runs out of memory
       it will exit with a return code of -1 and print a "malloc" error
       message.

       4va does not check that the object file that it's reading is well-
       behaved.  If your object file is corrupt, 4va may hang.

       4va has worked on every system I've tried it on; it's basic enough that
       it should port to your machine. If you have problems, let me know.
