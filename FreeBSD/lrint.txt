LRINT(3)               FreeBSD Library Functions Manual               LRINT(3)

NAME
     llrint, llrintf, llrintl, lrint, lrintf, lrintl – convert to integer

LIBRARY
     Math Library (libm, -lm)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <math.h>

     long long
     llrint(double x);

     long long
     llrintf(float x);

     long long
     llrintl(long double x);

     long
     lrint(double x);

     long
     lrintf(float x);

     long
     lrintl(long double x);

DESCRIPTION
     The lrint() function returns the integer nearest to its argument x
     according to the current rounding mode.  If the rounded result is too
     large to be represented as a long value, an invalid exception is raised
     and the return value is undefined.  Otherwise, if x is not an integer,
     lrint() raises an inexact exception.  When the rounded result is
     representable as a long, the expression lrint(x) is equivalent to
     (long)rint(x) (although the former may be more efficient).

     The llrint(), llrintf(), llrintl(), lrintf(), and lrintl() functions
     differ from lrint() only in their input and output types.

STANDARDS
     These functions conform to ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (“ISO C99”).

HISTORY
     The llrint(), llrintf(), lrint(), and lrintf() routines first appeared in
     FreeBSD 5.4.  The long double variants were introduced in FreeBSD 8.0.
