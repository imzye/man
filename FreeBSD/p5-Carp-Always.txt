NAME
       Carp::Always - Warns and dies noisily with stack backtraces

SYNOPSIS
         use Carp::Always;

       Often used on the command line:

         perl -MCarp::Always script.pl

DESCRIPTION
       This module is meant as a debugging aid. It can be used to make a
       script complain loudly with stack backtraces when warn()ing or
       die()ing.

       Here are how stack backtraces produced by this module looks:

         # it works for explicit die's and warn's
         $ perl -MCarp::Always -e 'sub f { die "arghh" }; sub g { f }; g'
         arghh at -e line 1
                 main::f() called at -e line 1
                 main::g() called at -e line 1

         # it works for interpreter-thrown failures
         $ perl -MCarp::Always -w -e 'sub f { $a = shift; @a = @$a };' \
                                  -e 'sub g { f(undef) }; g'
         Use of uninitialized value in array dereference at -e line 1
                 main::f('undef') called at -e line 2
                 main::g() called at -e line 2

       In the implementation, the Carp module does the heavy work, through
       longmess(). The actual implementation sets the signal hooks
       $SIG{__WARN__} and $SIG{__DIE__} to emit the stack backtraces.

       Also, all uses of "carp" and "croak" are made verbose, behaving like
       "cluck" and "confess".

METHODS
       Carp::Always implements the following methods.

   import
         Carp::Always->import()

       Enables Carp::Always. Also triggered by statements like

         use Carp::Always;
         use Carp::Always 0.14;

       but not by

         use Carp::Always ();    # does not invoke import()

   unimport
         Carp::Always->unimport();

       Disables Carp::Always. Also triggered with

         no Carp::Always;

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
       This module was born as a reaction to a release of Acme::JavaTrace by
       Sébastien Aperghis-Tramoni.  Sébastien also has a newer module called
       Devel::SimpleTrace with the same code and fewer flame comments on docs.
       The pruning of the uselessly long docs of this module was prodded by
       Michael Schwern.

       Schwern and others told me "the module name stinked" - it was called
       "Carp::Indeed". After thinking long and getting nowhere, I went with
       nuffin's suggestion and now it is called "Carp::Always".

BUGS
       •   This module does not play well with other modules which fusses
           around with "warn", "die", $SIG{__WARN__}, $SIG{__DIE__}.

       •   Test scripts are good. I should write more of these.
