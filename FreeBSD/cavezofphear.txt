NAME
       phear - Boulder Dash / Digger-like game for consoles/terminals

SYNOPSIS
       phear [--version] [--help] [MAPFILE]
       phear --edit MAPFILE

DESCRIPTION
       You are trapped in the CAVEZ of PHEAR, your mission is to escape
       through all the caves and make it out alive. To escape through a cave
       you will have to find all the diamonds located in it. Once you've found
       all the diamonds, their powers combined will help you get to the next
       cave, one step closer to freedom.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              display this help

       -v, --version
              display program version

       -e, --edit
              run level editor on the specified file

HOW TO PLAY
       By picking up a diamond `*' you get 10 points, picking up money `$'
       gives you 100 points. You get one extra life for every 1000 points you
       score.

       Move around with the arrow keys or the 2-4-8-6 keys. Press `k` to
       commit suicide if you should get stuck.

       Got the bombs (`%')? Great! Press b to place them, and t to detonate
       them all at once. Note that the bombs you place will act just like
       stones, affected by gravity, rolling, and so on...

       Watch out for monsters (`M') -- if they catch you, you will die. To
       fight back, drop stones on them or blow them up using your bombs.

       Pressing `s' will enable/disable sound, `w' will highlight your current
       position.

EDITOR
       Start the editor with `phear -e MAPFILE', use 0-9 keys to place
       objects, `s' to save the map, `q' to quit and `l' to enable lock-mode
       (lets you draw using arrow-keys). Play your map with `phear MAPFILE'.
