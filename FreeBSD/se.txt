SCRIPTSE(1)             FreeBSD General Commands Manual            SCRIPTSE(1)

NAME
       scriptse - make scripts for se

SYNOPSIS
       scriptse [ -d ] < script_file | se [ & ]

DESCRIPTION
       Scriptse reads standard input, and writes standard output.  It is a
       simple filter which turns newlines ('\n') into carriage returns ('\r')
       for se(1).  This allows se to be run from a prepared script.  Se can
       then be fired off into the background, if you wish.

       After each carriage return, scriptse adds an ASCII DEL character
       ('\177').  This is so that command lines which fail will be erased, and
       the next command can then be executed.  If it did not, command lines
       would get concatenated together, and they would simply continue to
       fail.  Ultimately, the editor would run out of input buffer and start
       to contiunuously ring the bell on the terminal.  With the DEL
       character, each command line is executed on its own.

       Scriptse takes one option, -d.  If this option is used, scriptse will
       not add the ASCII DEL after each carriage return.  This is useful for
       program which want to turn newlines into carraige returns.

       If you do use a script, either sit back and watch it run, or redirect
       the output into a file (or /dev/null, if you are confident).

SEE ALSO
       se(1).

CAVEATS
       It is rather difficult to interrupt se when it is running, so editor
       scripts should write their changed buffer to a new file, in case
       something goes wrong.

BUGS
       Does no checking for any of se's control characters.  If you put
       control characters into a script, you are taking your chances.
