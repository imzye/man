NAME
       Carp::REPL - read-eval-print-loop on die and/or warn

SYNOPSIS
       The intended way to use this module is through the command line.

           perl -MCarp::REPL tps-report.pl
               Can't call method "cover_sheet" without a package or object reference at tps-report.pl line 6019.

           # instead of exiting, you get a REPL!

           $ $form
           27B/6

           $ $self->get_form
           27B/6

           $ "ah ha! there's my bug, I thought get_form returned an object"
           ah ha! there's my bug, I thought get_form returned an object

USAGE
   "-MCarp::REPL"
   "-MCarp::REPL=warn"
       Works as command line argument. This automatically installs the die
       handler for you, so if you receive a fatal error you get a REPL before
       the universe explodes. Specifying "=warn" also installs a warn handler
       for finding those mysterious warnings.

   "use Carp::REPL;"
   "use Carp::REPL 'warn';"
       Same as above.

   "use Carp::REPL 'nodie';"
       Loads the module without installing the die handler. Use this if you
       just want to run "Carp::REPL::repl" on your own terms.

   "use Carp::REPL 'test';"
   "-MCarp::REPL=test"
       Load a REPL on test failure! (as long as it uses "ok" in Test::More)

FUNCTIONS
   repl
       This module's interface consists of exactly one function: repl. This is
       provided so you may install your own $SIG{__DIE__} handler if you have
       no alternatives.

       It takes the same arguments as die, and returns no useful value. In
       fact, don't even depend on it returning at all!

       One useful place for calling this manually is if you just want to check
       the state of things without having to throw a fake error. You can also
       change any variables and those changes will be seen by the rest of your
       program.

           use Carp::REPL 'repl';

           sub involved_calculation {
               # ...
               $d = maybe_zero();
               # ...
               repl(); # $d = 1
               $sum += $n / $d;
               # ...
           }

       Unfortunately if you instead go with the usual "-MCarp::REPL", then
       $SIG{__DIE__} will be invoked and there's no general way to recover.
       But you can still change variables to poke at things.

COMMANDS
       Note that this is not supposed to be a full-fledged debugger. A few
       commands are provided to aid you in finding out what went awry. See
       Devel::ebug if you're looking for a serious debugger.

       •   :u

           Moves one frame up in the stack.

       •   :d

           Moves one frame down in the stack.

       •   :top

           Moves to the top frame of the stack.

       •   :bottom

           Moves to the bottom frame of the stack.

       •   :t

           Redisplay the stack trace.

       •   :e

           Display the current lexical environment.

       •   :l

           List eleven lines of source code of the current frame.

       •   :q

           Close the REPL. ("^D" also works)

VARIABLES
       •   $_REPL

           This represents the Devel::REPL object.

       •   $_a

           This represents the arguments passed to the subroutine at the
           current frame in the call stack. Modifications are ignored (how
           would that work anyway?  Re-invoke the sub?)

CAVEATS
       Dynamic scope probably produces unexpected results. I don't see any
       easy (or even difficult!) solution to this. Therefore it's a caveat and
       not a bug. :)
