FFSINFO(8)              FreeBSD System Manager's Manual             FFSINFO(8)

NAME
     ffsinfo – dump all meta information of an existing ufs file system

SYNOPSIS
     ffsinfo [-g cylinder_group] [-i inode] [-l level] [-o outfile]
             special | file

DESCRIPTION
     The ffsinfo utility extends the dumpfs(8) utility.

     The output is appended to the file outfile.  Also expect the output file
     to be rather large.  Up to 2 percent of the size of the specified file
     system is not uncommon.

     The following options are available:

     -g cylinder_group
             This restricts the dump to information about this cylinder group
             only.  Here 0 means the first cylinder group and -1 the last one.

     -i inode
             This restricts the dump to information about this particular
             inode only.  Here the minimum acceptable inode is 2.  If this
             option is omitted but a cylinder group is defined then only
             inodes within that cylinder group are dumped.

     -l level
             The level of detail which will be dumped.  This value defaults to
             255 and is the “bitwise or” of the following table:

             0x001   initial superblock
             0x002   superblock copies in each cylinder group
             0x004   cylinder group summary in initial cylinder group
             0x008   cylinder group information
             0x010   inode allocation bitmap
             0x020   fragment allocation bitmap
             0x040   cluster maps and summary
             0x100   inode information
             0x200   indirect block dump

     -o outfile
             This sets the output filename where the dump is written to, and
             must be specified.  If - is provided, output will be sent to
             stdout.

EXAMPLES
           ffsinfo -o /var/tmp/ffsinfo -l 1023 /dev/vinum/testvol

     will dump /dev/vinum/testvol to /var/tmp/ffsinfo with all available
     information.

BUGS
     Snapshots are handled like plain files.  They should get their own level
     to provide for independent control of the amount of what gets dumped.  It
     probably also makes sense to some extend to dump the snapshot as a file
     system.
