NAME
     gss_release_oid_set – Discard a set of object identifiers

SYNOPSIS
     #include <gssapi/gssapi.h>

     OM_uint32
     gss_release_oid_set(OM_uint32 *minor_status, gss_OID_set *set);

DESCRIPTION
     Free storage associated with a GSS-API generated gss_OID_set object.  The
     set parameter must refer to an OID-set that was returned from a GSS-API

     gss_OID_set_desc itself.

     Implementations are encouraged to set the gss_OID_set parameter to
     GSS_C_NO_OID_SET on successful completion of this routine.

PARAMETERS
     minor_status      Mechanism specific status code.

     set               The storage associated with the gss_OID_set will be
                       deleted.
