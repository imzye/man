Algorithm::Dependency::Objects(3)          User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Algorithm::Dependency::Objects - An implementation of an Object
       Dependency Algorithm

SYNOPSIS
               use Algorithm::Dependency::Objects;

               my $o = Algorithm::Dependency::Objects->new(
                       objects => \@objects,
                       selected => \@selected, # objects which are already taken care of
               );

               my @needed = $o->schedule( $objects[0] );

               # need to take care of @needed for $objecs[0] to be resolved

DESCRIPTION
       This modules is a re-implementation of Algorithm::Dependency using only
       objects instead of object ids, making use of Set::Object for book-
       keeping.

METHODS
       new Duh.

       objects
       selected
           Returns the Set::Object representing this collection. Objects is an
           enumeration of all the object who we're dependo-frobnicating, and
           selected is those that don't need to be run.

       depends
       schedule
       schedule_all
           See Algorithm::Dependency's corresponding methods.

       verify_input_set $object_set
           Make sure that the dependencies of every object in the set are also
           in the set.

       handle_missing_objects $missing_set, $input_set
           Called by "verify_input_set" when objects are missing from the
           input set.

           You can override this method to simply return

                   $input_set->union($missing_set);

           making all dependencies of the input objects implicit input objects
           themselves.

       unknown_object $object
           Called when a new object pops out of the blue in the middle of
           processing (it means "get_deps" is returning inconsistent values).

       get_deps $object
           Extract the dependencies out of an object. Calls "depends" on the
           object.

       can_get_deps $object
           Default implementation is

                   $object->can("depends");

       assert_can_get_deps $object_set
           Croaks if "can_get_deps" doesn't return true for every object in
           the set.

       is based.

BUGS
       None that we are aware of. Of course, if you find a bug, let us know,
       and we will be sure to fix it.
