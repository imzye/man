NAME
       GMail::IMAPD - An IMAP4 gateway to Google's webmail service

SYNOPSIS
           # Start an IMAP-to-Gmail daemon on port 1143

           use GMail::IMAPD;

           my $daemon=GMail::IMAPD->new(LocalPort=>1143,
                                        LogFile=>'gmail_imapd.log',
                                        Debug=>1);
           $daemon->run();

           # Or if you prefer to use your own server socket,
           # you can do something like:

           my $i2g=GMail::IMAPD->new(LogFile=>'imapd.log');

           for(;;){
             my $s=someserver();
             $i2g->procimap($s);
           }

DESCRIPTION
       This module allows users to access their Gmail messages with an IMAP
       client by running a server which accepts IMAP connections.

METHODS
       new ( [ARGS] )
           Creates a new object.  All arguments are optional and are in key =>
           value form.  Valid arguments are:

                   LocalAddr       Local host bind address
                   LocalPort       Local bind port
                   Detach          Boolean to run in background.  Default = 1
                   LogFile         Path to log file
                   Debug           1 = extra information, 2 = raw socket data
                   CacheDBH        Database handle, see below
                   Socket          Socket handle for processing IMAP commands

       procimap ( $socket_handle )
           Directly pass a handle to the module to process IMAP commands.

NOTES
       The IMAP and Gmail models differ. How GMail::IMAPD translates these
       differences is mostly intuitive.  For instance, folders translate to
       labels.  You can even have subfolders which translate to label names
       such as 'Work/NewProject'.  Some translations that aren't as intuitive
       are shown in the table below:

         - Copy message to folder -> Add label to message
         - Move message from Inbox to folder -> Add label to message and archive
         - Move message from folder to Inbox -> Remove label and unarchive
         - Delete message in Inbox -> Archive message
         - Delete message in folder -> Remove message label
         - Delete message in Trash -> Permanently delete message

       Messages from other IMAP accounts can be appended to the Gmail Inbox,
       and Inbox only.  The module achieves this by emailing the message to
       the Gmail account.  Therefore, the append procedure may be slow and the
       message will initially be marked unread.

       To persistently cache Gmail messages, a database handle can be given as
       an argument.  Using the Tie::RDBM module, GMail::IMAPD will
       automatically create a table for each user and store messages in this
       table.

       GMail::IMAPD is not fully IMAP4 compliant and has just enough
       functionality to get by. It has been tested with Firefox, Outlook,
       Outlook Express, and mail2web.com.

CAVEATS
       The IMAP client is automatically subscribed to all folders/labels.
       Unsubscribe has no effect.  This is to eliminate any need for
       persistent server side data at the moment.

       Once a message has been moved to Trash, it cannot be un-Trashed with
       the IMAP client.  This functionality might be missing in the
       Mail::Webmail::Gmail module or I'm not sure how to do it with the
       module.

       Access to large folders is slow.  To fetch simple header information
       requested by most IMAP clients (FLAGS, INTERNALDATE, etc) requires
       GMail::IMAPD to download the entire message.  Using persistent message
       caching with CacheDBH helps alleviate this problem.

       To work, GMail::IMAPD currently bundles and uses patched versions of
       UserAgent and Mail::Webmail::Gmail.  One line of UserAgent was changed
       to forward cookies to Gmail.  And, only a patched version of
       Mail::Webmail::Gmail works with the current version of Gmail.  Future
       versions of GMail::IMAPD will remove these patched modules when the
       actual modules are updated.

BUGS
       If a message is replied-to via the gmail web interface and the reply is
       discarded, the message becomes unavaible to interfaces such as
       Mail::Webmail::Gmail.  I believe this is a Google bug.

PREREQUISITES
       LWP

       Crypt::SSLeay

TODO
       - Better error handling

       - IMAPS support

       - A contacts folder, perhaps containing messages with xml and vcf
       attachments

       - Copy from other IMAP accounts to any Gmail folder

       - Interface with Mail::Webmail::Yahoo ?

CREDITS
       I'd like to thank Allen Holman (mincus) for the Mail::Webmail::Gmail
       module.  His module greatly accelerated the development of
       GMail::IMAPD.
