AIO_RETURN(2)             FreeBSD System Calls Manual            AIO_RETURN(2)

NAME
     aio_return – retrieve return status of asynchronous I/O operation
     (REALTIME)

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <aio.h>

     ssize_t
     aio_return(struct aiocb *iocb);

DESCRIPTION
     The aio_return() system call returns the final status of the asynchronous
     I/O request associated with the structure pointed to by iocb.

     The aio_return() system call should only be called once, to obtain the
     final status of an asynchronous I/O operation once it has completed
     (aio_error(2) returns something other than EINPROGRESS).

RETURN VALUES
     If the asynchronous I/O request has completed, the status is returned as
     described in read(2), readv(2), write(2), writev(2), or fsync(2).
     Otherwise, aio_return() returns -1 and sets errno to indicate the error
     condition.

ERRORS
     The aio_return() system call will fail if:

     [EINVAL]           The iocb argument does not reference a completed
                        asynchronous I/O request.

     [EINVAL]           The I/O operation was submitted with lio_listio(), and
                        the value of the aio_lio_opcode is invalid.

SEE ALSO
     aio_cancel(2), aio_error(2), aio_suspend(2), aio_waitcomplete(2),
     aio_write(2), fsync(2), read(2), write(2), aio(4)

STANDARDS
     The aio_return() system call is expected to conform to the IEEE Std
     1003.1 (“POSIX.1”) standard.

HISTORY
     The aio_return() system call first appeared in FreeBSD 3.0.
