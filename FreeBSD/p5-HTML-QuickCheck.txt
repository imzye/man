NAME
       HTMLQuickCheck.pm -- a simple and fast HTML syntax checking package for
       perl 4 and perl 5

SYNOPSIS
           require 'HTMLQuickCheck.pm';

           &HTML'QuickCheck'OK($html_text) || die "Bad HTML: $HTML'QuickCheck'Error";

           or for perl 5:
           HTML::QuickCheck::OK($html_text) ||
                   die "Bad HTML: $HTML::QuickCheck::Error";

DESCRIPTION
       The objective of the package is to provide a fast and essential HTML
       check (esp. for CGI scripts where response time is important) to
       prevent a piece of user input HTML code from messing up the rest of a
       file, i.e., to minimize and localize any possible damage created by
       including a piece of user input HTML text in a dynamic document.

       HTMLQuickCheck checks for unmatched < and >, unmatched tags and
       improper nesting, which could ruin the rest of the document.
       Attributes and elements with optional end tags are not checked, as they
       should not cause disasters with any decent browsers (they should ignore
       any unrecognized tags and attributes according to the standard).  A
       piece of HTML that passes HTMLQuickCheck may not necessarily be valid
       HTML, but it would be very unlikely to screw others but itself. A valid
       piece of HTML that doesn't pass the HTMLQuickCheck is however very
       likely to screw many browsers(which are obviously broken in terms of
       strict conformance).

       HTMLQuickCheck currently supports HTML 1.0, 2.x (draft), 3.0 (draft)
       and netscape extensions (1.1).

EXAMPLE
           htmlchk, a simple html checker:

           #!/usr/local/bin/perl
           require 'HTMLQuickCheck.pm';
           undef $/;
           print &HTML'QuickCheck'OK(<>) ? "HTML OK\n" :
                   "Bad HTML:\n", $HTML'QuickCheck'Error;
           __END__

           Usage:
           htmlchk [html_file]
