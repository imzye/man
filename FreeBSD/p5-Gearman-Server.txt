NAME
       gearmand - Gearman client/worker connector.

SYNOPSIS
        gearmand --daemon

DESCRIPTION
       This is the main executable for Gearman::Server.  It provides command-
       line configuration of port numbers, pidfiles, and daemonization.

OPTIONS
       --daemonize / -d
           Make the daemon run in the background (good for init.d scripts, bad
           for running under daemontools/supervise).

       --port=7003 / -p 7003
           Set the port number, defaults to 7003.

       --pidfile=/some/dir/gearmand.pid
           Write a pidfile when starting up

       --debug=1
           Enable debugging (currently the only debug output is when a client
           or worker connects).

       --accept=10
           Number of new connections to accept each time we see a listening
           socket ready. This doesn't usually need to be tuned by anyone,
           however in dire circumstances you may need to do it quickly.

       --wakeup=3
           Number of workers to wake up per job inserted into the queue.

           Zero (0) is a perfectly acceptable answer, and can be used if you
           don't care much about job latency.  This would bank on the base
           idea of a worker checking in with the server every so often.

           Negative One (-1) indicates that all sleeping workers should be
           woken up.

           All other negative numbers will cause the server to throw exception
           and not start.

       --wakeup-delay=
           Time interval before waking up more workers (the value specified by
           --wakeup) when jobs are still in the queue.

           Zero (0) means go as fast as possible, but not all at the same
           time. Similar to -1 on --wakeup, but is more cooperative in
           gearmand's multitasking model.

           Negative One (-1) means that this event won't happe, so only the
           initial workers will be woken up to handle jobs in the queue.
