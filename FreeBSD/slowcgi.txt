SLOWCGI(8)              FreeBSD System Manager's Manual             SLOWCGI(8)

NAME
     slowcgi – a FastCGI to CGI wrapper server

SYNOPSIS
     slowcgi [-dv] [-p path] [-s socket] [-t timeout] [-U user] [-u user]

DESCRIPTION
     slowcgi is a server which implements the FastCGI Protocol to execute CGI
     scripts.  FastCGI was designed to overcome the CGI protocol's scalability
     and resource sharing limitations.  While CGI scripts need to be forked
     for every request, FastCGI scripts can be kept running and handle many
     HTTP requests.

     slowcgi is a simple server that translates FastCGI requests to the CGI
     protocol.  It executes the requested CGI script and translates its output
     back to the FastCGI protocol.

     Modern web frameworks and web applications usually come with the
     capability to run as FastCGI servers.  slowcgi is not intended for these
     applications.

     slowcgi opens a socket at /var/www/run/slowcgi.sock, owned by www:www,
     with permissions 0660.  It will then chroot(8) to /var/www and drop
     privileges to user "www".

     The options are as follows:

     -d      Do not daemonize.  If this option is specified, slowcgi will run
             in the foreground and log to stderr.

     -p path
             chroot(2) to path.  A path of / effectively disables the chroot.

     -s socket
             Create and bind to alternative local socket at socket.

     -t timeout
             Terminate the request after timeout seconds instead of the
             default 120 seconds.  The CGI script is left to run but its
             standard input, output and error will be closed.

     -U user
             Change the owner of /var/www/run/slowcgi.sock to user and its
             primary group instead of the default www:www.

     -u user
             Drop privileges to user instead of default user www and chroot(8)
             to the home directory of user.

     -v      Enable more verbose (debug) logging.

BUGS
     slowcgi only implements the parts of the FastCGI standard needed to
     execute CGI scripts.  This is intentional.
