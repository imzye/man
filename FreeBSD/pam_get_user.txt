PAM_GET_USER(3)        FreeBSD Library Functions Manual        PAM_GET_USER(3)

NAME
     pam_get_user – retrieve user name

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <security/pam_appl.h>

     int
     pam_get_user(pam_handle_t *pamh, const char **user, const char *prompt);

DESCRIPTION
     The pam_get_user() function returns the name of the target user, as
     specified to pam_start(3).  If no user was specified, nor set using
     pam_set_item(3), pam_get_user() will prompt for a user name.  Either way,
     a pointer to the user name is stored in the location pointed to by the
     user argument, and the corresponding PAM item is updated.

     The prompt argument specifies a prompt to use if no user name is cached.
     If it is NULL, the PAM_USER_PROMPT item will be used.  If that item is
     also NULL, a hardcoded default prompt will be used.  Additionally, when
     pam_get_user() is called from a service module, the prompt may be
     affected by module options as described below.  The prompt is then
     expanded using openpam_subst(3) before it is passed to the conversation
     function.

MODULE OPTIONS
     When called by a service module, pam_get_user() will recognize the
     following module options:

     user_prompt         Prompt to use when asking for the user name.  This
                         option overrides both the prompt argument and the
                         PAM_USER_PROMPT item.

RETURN VALUES
     The pam_get_user() function returns one of the following values:

     [PAM_SUCCESS]       Success.

     [PAM_BAD_ITEM]      Unrecognized or restricted item.

     [PAM_BUF_ERR]       Memory buffer error.

     [PAM_CONV_ERR]      Conversation failure.

     [PAM_SYSTEM_ERR]    System error.
