BOOTPARAMD(8)           FreeBSD System Manager's Manual          BOOTPARAMD(8)

NAME
     bootparamd – boot parameter server

SYNOPSIS
     bootparamd [-ds] [-r router] [-f file]

DESCRIPTION
     The bootparamd utility is a server process that provides information to
     diskless(8) clients necessary for booting.  It consults the
     /etc/bootparams file.

     This version will allow the use of aliases on the hostname in the
     /etc/bootparams file.  The returned hostname to the whoami request done
     by the booting client will be the name that appears in /etc/bootparams
     and not the canonical name.  In this way you can keep the answer short
     enough so that machines that cannot handle long hostnames will not fail
     during boot.

OPTIONS
     -d          Display the debugging information.

     -s          Log the debugging information with syslog(3).

     -r router   The default router (a machine or an IP-address).  This
                 defaults to the machine running the server.

     -f file     The file to use as boot parameter file instead of
                 /etc/bootparams.

FILES
     /etc/bootparams  default boot parameter file

EXAMPLES
     When netbooting diskless SunOS/Xkernel SPARCstations the booted SunOS
     kernel also broadcasts to the all-0 address.  The SunOS kernel hangs
     until it receives a reply.  To accommodate this behaviour add an alias
     address that responds to an all-0 broadcast.  So, add something like
     ‘ifconfig xl0 192.168.200.254 netmask 255.255.255.255 broadcast
     192.168.200.0 alias’ on the relevant network interface on your bootparamd
     server.  The alias address must of course be free for use.

BUGS
     You may find the syslog(3) loggings to be verbose.
