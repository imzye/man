           allow_undeclared => BOOLEAN
             When true, you may call the reader or writer with types which
             were not registered with declare().  In that case, the reader or
             writer may also get options passed for the compiler, as long as
             they are consistent over each use of the type.

           any_element => CODE|'TAKE_ALL'|'SKIP_ALL'|'ATTEMPT'|'SLOPPY'
             See anyElement().

             [1.02] the default is to ATTEMPT compiling any handlers
             automatically.  Before version 1.02, the default was to SKIP_ALL
             elements which would match the occurs and namespace restrictions
             of the any specification.  However, that fails for reperative
             blocks (for instance, it fails for an choice which may occur
             unbounded times)

           block_namespace => NAMESPACE|TYPE|HASH|CODE|ARRAY
           hook => $hook|ARRAY
           hooks => ARRAY
           ignore_unused_tags => BOOLEAN|REGEXP

           opts_readers => HASH|ARRAY-of-PAIRS
           opts_rw => HASH|ARRAY-of-PAIRS
             Options added to both READERs and WRITERS.  Options which are
             passed with declare() and "opts_readers" or "opts_writers" will
             overrule these.  See addCompileOptions().

           opts_writers => HASH|ARRAY-of-PAIRS
           parser_options => HASH|ARRAY
           prefixes => HASH|ARRAY-of-PAIRS
             Define prefix name to name-space mappings.  Passed to
             compile(prefixes) for each reader and writer, but also used to
             permit findName() to accept types which use a prefix.

             Specify an ARRAY of (prefix, name-space) pairs, or a HASH which
             maps name-spaces to prefixes (HASH order is reversed from ARRAY
             order!)  When you wish to collect the results, like usage counts,
             of the translation processing, you will need to specify a HASH.

              prefixes => [ mine => $myns, your => $yourns ]
              prefixes => { $myns => 'mine', $yourns => 'your' }

              # the previous is short for:
              prefixes => { $myns => [ uri => $myns, prefix => 'mine', used => 0 ]
                          , $yourns => [ uri => $yourns, prefix => 'your', ...] }

   Accessors
       Extends "Accessors" in XML::Compile::Schema.

       $obj->addHook($hook|LIST|undef)
           Inherited, see "Accessors" in XML::Compile::Schema

       $obj->addHooks( $hook, [$hook, ...] )
           Inherited, see "Accessors" in XML::Compile::Schema

       $obj->addKeyRewrite($predef|CODE|HASH, ...)
           Inherited, see "Accessors" in XML::Compile::Schema

       $obj->addSchemaDirs(@directories|$filename)
       XML::Compile::Cache->addSchemaDirs(@directories|$filename)
           Inherited, see "Accessors" in XML::Compile

       $obj->addSchemas($xml, %options)
           Inherited, see "Accessors" in XML::Compile::Schema

       $obj->addTypemap(PAIR)
           Inherited, see "Accessors" in XML::Compile::Schema

       $obj->addTypemaps(PAIRS)
           Inherited, see "Accessors" in XML::Compile::Schema

       $obj->addXsiType( [HASH|ARRAY|LIST] )
           [1.01] add global xsi_type declarations.  Returns the xsiType set.
           The ARRAY or LIST contains pairs, just like the HASH.

           The value component can be 'AUTO' to automatically detect the
           "xsi:type" extensions.  This does only work for complex types.

       $obj->allowUndeclared( [BOOLEAN] )
           Whether it is permitted to create readers and writers which are not
           declared cleanly.

       $obj->anyElement('ATTEMPT'|'SLOPPY'|'SKIP_ALL'|'TAKE_ALL'|CODE)
           [as method since 0.99] How to process ANY elements, see also
           new(any_element).

           Reader: "ATTEMPT" will convert all any elements, applying the
           reader for each element found. When an element is not found in a
           schema, it will be included as XML::LibXML::Element node.

           [0.93] Reader: With "SLOPPY", first automatic typed conversion is
           attempted. But is the type is not known,
           XML::LibXML::Simple::XMLin() is called to the resque.

       $obj->blockNamespace($ns|$type|HASH|CODE|ARRAY)
           Inherited, see "Accessors" in XML::Compile::Schema

       $obj->hooks( [<'READER'|'WRITER'>] )
           Inherited, see "Accessors" in XML::Compile::Schema

       $obj->typemap( [HASH|ARRAY|PAIRS] )
           [0.98] Add global knowledge on typemaps.  Returns the typemap.

       $obj->useSchema( $schema, [$schema, ...] )
           Inherited, see "Accessors" in XML::Compile::Schema

   Prefix management
       The cache layer on top of XML::Compile::Schema adds smart use of
       prefixes.  Of course, smartness comes with a small performance cost,
       but the code gets much cleaner.

       $obj->addNicePrefix(BASE, NAMESPACE)
           [1.03] Register NAMESPACE -if not yet defined- with prefix name
           BASE.  When that prefix name is already in use for some other
           namespace, BASE followed by a number are attempted (starting with
           01).  The prefix is returned.

           When the BASE already ends on a number, that number will get
           counted.

           example:

             my $prefix = $schema->addNicePrefix('call', $myns);
             # $prefix now can be call, call01, call02 etc

       $obj->addPrefixes( [PAIRS|ARRAY|HASH] )
           The X::C logic does auto-detect prefix/namespaces combinations from
           the XML, but does not search extensively for namespace
           declarations.  Also, sometimes the same namespace is used with
           different prefixes.  Sometimes, the same prefix is used for
           different namesapces.  To complete the list, or control the actual
           prefix being used, you explicitly declare combinations.

           The best way to add prefixes is via new(prefixes), which will give
           your names preference over the names found in the schema's which
           get loaded.  For instance, use "::WSDL->new(prefixes => [ $prefix
           => $ns ]"

           [0.995] Returns the HASH with prefix to name-space translations.
           You should not modify the returned HASH: new PAIRS of prefix to
           namespace relations can be passed as arguments.

           [0.14] If a name-space appears for the second time, then the new
           prefix will be recognized by findName(), but not used in the
           output.  When the prefix already exists for a different namespace,
           then an error will be casted.

           [0.90] You may also provide an ARRAY of pairs or a HASH.

       $obj->learnPrefixes($node)
           [0.993] Take all the prefixes defined in the $node, and
           XML::LibXML::Element.  This is not recursive: only on those defined
           at the top $node.

       $obj->prefix($prefix)
           Lookup a prefix definition.  This returns a HASH with namespace
           info.

       $obj->prefixFor($uri)
           Lookup the preferred prefix for the $uri.

       $obj->prefixed( $type|<$ns,$local> )
           Translate the fully qualified $type into a prefixed version.  Will
           produce undef if the namespace is unknown.

           [0.993] When your $type is not in packed form, you can specify a
           namespace and $local type name as separate arguments.

           example:

              print $schema->prefixed($type) || $type;
              print $schema->prefixed($ns, $local);

       $obj->prefixes( [$params] )
           Return prefixes table.  The $params are deprecated since [0.995],
           see addPrefixes().

   Compilers
       The name of this module refers to its power to administer compiled XML
       encoders (writers) and decoders (readers).  This means that your
       program only need to pass on a ::Cache object (for instance a
       XML::Compile::WSDL11, not a CODE reference for each compiled
       translator.

       Extends "Compilers" in XML::Compile::Schema.

       $obj->addCompileOptions( ['READERS'|'WRITERS'|'RW'], %options )
           [0.99] You may provide global compile options with new(opts_rw),
           "opts_readers" and "opts_writers", but also later using this
           method.

       $obj->compile( <'READER'|'WRITER'>, $type, %options )
           Inherited, see "Compilers" in XML::Compile::Schema

       $obj->compileAll( ['READERS'|'WRITERS'|'RW', [$ns]] )
           Compile all the declared readers and writers with the default
           'RW').  You may also select to pre-compile only the READERS or only
           the WRITERS.  The selection can be limited further by specifying a
           $ns.

           By default, the processors are only compiled when used.  This
           method is especially useful in a daemon process, where preparations
           can take as much time as they want to... and running should be as
           fast as possible.

       $obj->compileType( <'READER'|'WRITER'>, $type, %options )
           Inherited, see "Compilers" in XML::Compile::Schema

       $obj->dataToXML($node|REF-XML|XML-STRING|$filename|$fh|$known)
       XML::Compile::Cache->dataToXML($node|REF-XML|XML-STRING|$filename|$fh|$known)
           Inherited, see "Compilers" in XML::Compile

       $obj->initParser(%options)
       XML::Compile::Cache->initParser(%options)
           Inherited, see "Compilers" in XML::Compile

       $obj->reader($type|$name, %options)
           Returns the reader CODE for the $type or $name (see findName()).
           %options are only permitted if new(allow_undeclared) is true, and
           the same as the previous call to this method.

           The reader will be compiled the first time that it is used, and
           that same CODE reference will be returned each next request for the
           same $type.  Call compileAll() to have all readers compiled by
           force.

            -Option --Default
             is_type  <false>

           is_type => BOOLEAN
             [1.03] use compileType() with the given element, to replace
             compile() You probably want an additional "element" parameter.

           example:

             my $schema = XML::Compile::Cache->new(\@xsd,
                prefixes => [ gml => $GML_NAMESPACE ] );
             my $data   = $schema->reader('gml:members')->($xml);

             my $getmem = $schema->reader('gml:members');
             my $data   = $getmem->($xml);

       $obj->template( <'XML'|'PERL'|'TREE'>, $element, %options )
           Inherited, see "Compilers" in XML::Compile::Schema

       $obj->writer($type|$name)
           Returns the writer CODE for the $type or $name (see findName()).
           OPTIONS are only permitted if new(allow_undeclared) is true, and
           the same as the previous call to this method.

           The writer will be compiled the first time that it is used, and
           that same CODE reference will be returned each next request for the
           same type.

            -Option --Default
             is_type  <false>

           is_type => BOOLEAN
             [1.03] use compileType() with the given element, to replace
             compile() You probably want an additional "element" parameter.

           example:

             my $xml = $cache->writer('gml:members')->($doc, $data);

             my $doc = XML::LibXML::Document->new('1.0', 'UTF-8');
             my $wr  = $cache->writer('gml:members');
             my $xml = $wr->($doc, $data);
             $doc->setDocumentElement($xml);
             print $doc->toString(1);

   Administration
       Extends "Administration" in XML::Compile::Schema.

       $obj->declare( <'READER'|'WRITER'|'RW'>, <$type|ARRAY>, %options )
           Register that the indicated $type (or ARRAY of them) may be used,
           and needs to be translated with the %options (either specified as
           ARRAY or PAIRS).  Specify whether it may get used as READER,
           WRITER, or both (RW).  If the READER and WRITER need different
           options, then you need to declare them separately; in that case you
           cannot use RW.

           The $type should be understood by findName(), so may be prefixed.

           example:

             $cache->declare(READER => 'pref:count', sloppy_integers => 1)
                   ->declare(RW     => '{myns}mylocal');

             $cache->declare(WRITER => [ 'xsd:int', '{http://}aap' ]);

       $obj->doesExtend($exttype, $basetype)
           Inherited, see "Administration" in XML::Compile::Schema

       $obj->elements()
           Inherited, see "Administration" in XML::Compile::Schema

       $obj->findName($name)
           Translate the $name specification into a schema defined full type.
           The $name can be a full type (like '{namespace}localname', usually
           created with XML::Compile::Util::pack_type()) or a prefixed type
           (like 'myns:localname', where "myns" is defined via new(prefixes)
           or prefixes()).

           When the form is 'myns:' (so without local name), the namespace uri
           is returned.

           example: of findName()

             $schema->addPrefixes(pre => 'http://namespace');

             my $type = $schema->findName('pre:name');
             print $type;   # {http://namespace}name

             my $ns   = $schema->findName('pre:');
             print $ns;     # http://namespace

             my $type = $schema->findName('{somens}name');
             print $type;   # {somens}name    [a no-op]

             show_declared  <true>

           show_declared => BOOLEAN
             Add an indicator to each line, about whether readers and writers
             are declare for the type.  Declared readers and writers will show
             flags "r" and "w" respectively.  Compiled readers and writers
             carry a "R" and/or "W".

DESCRIPTIONS
       "XML::Compile::Cache" is the smart brother of XML::Compile::Schema; it
       keeps track of your compiled readers and writers, and also helps you
       administer the parameters to handle compilation.  Besides, it lat you
       use easy prefixes instead of full namespaces.

       With XML::Compile::Schema::compile() (defined in the SUPER class of
       this module) you can construct translators from XML to Perl and back.
       These translators are code references, which are "expensive" to create,
       but "cheap" in use; call them as often as you want.  This module helps
       you administer them.

       When the schemas grow larger, it gets harder to see which code
       reference have already be created and which not. And, these code
       references need compile options which you do not want to distribute
       over your whole program.  Finally, in a daemon application, you do not
       want to create the translators when used (which can be in every client
       again), but once during the initiation of the daemon.

       One of the most important contributions to the compile management, is
       the addition of smart prefix handling. This means that you can use
       prefixed names in stead of full types, often created with
       XML::Compile::Util::pack_type().
