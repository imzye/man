NAME
       ipe - drawing editor for creating figures in PDF or EPS formats

SYNOPSIS
       ipe [ Qt options ] [ -sheet stylesheet ] filename


DESCRIPTION
       Ipe is a program that supports making small figures for inclusion into
       LaTeX documents as well as making multi-page PDF presentations.


       This manual page only documents the command line options and
       environment variables.  Full documentation for using Ipe can be found
       in HTML and PDF format; see below.


       -sheet stylesheet
              add the Ipe style sheet in the indicated file to all newly
              created Ipe documents.  This option can be used more than once.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       Ipe respects the following environment variables:


       IPELATEXDIR
              the directory where Ipe runs Pdflatex.


       IPELATEXPATH
              the directory containing pdflatex and xelatex.  If not set, they
              are searched for on the path.


       IPELETPATH a list of directories, separated by semicolons,
              containing ipelets. You can write a single underscore for the
              system-wide ipelet directory. If this variable is not set, the
              default consists of the system-wide ipelet directory, plus
              ~/.ipe/ipelets on Unix, plus ~/Library/Ipe/Ipelets on OS X.

       IPESTYLES a list of directories, separated by semicolons, where
              Ipe looks for stylesheets. You can write a single underscore for
              the system-wide stylesheet directory.  If this variable is not
              set, the default consists of the system-wide stylesheet
              directory, plus ~/.ipe/styles on Unix, plus ~/Library/Ipe/Styles
              on OS X.
