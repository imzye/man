cgprof(1)                   Linux Reference Manual                   cgprof(1)

NAME
       cgprof - generate colored call graph for profiled executables

SYNOPSIS
       cgprof [-h] [-T dev] [-g gmon_data] [gprof_file]

DESCRIPTION
       cgprof generate a function calling graph for a profiled executable. The
       executable must have been compiled and linked to output data suitable
       for gprof(1) (look at -pg option of gcc(1)). If no -T option is given,
       output is dot(1) commands. All the results are printed on standard
       output. cgprof takes gprof_file as input, or standard input.

       The result is a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where nodes represent
       functions traversed during the program execution, and edges function
       calls (arrow is from the caller to the called).

       Node colors represent the cumulative execution time spent by a function
       and its children. Colors range from intense red (100 % time) to pale
       violet (0 %), like a rainbow. A node is white filled when it has no
       time execution data available, which may be the case for profiling
       functions or not instrumented functions.

       cgprof helps to have a better understanding of program structure and
       execution. It makes hot spots identification visual and intuitive, and
       provides a minimum code coverage function.

OPTIONS
       -h     Display this help text.

       -T dev This option sets the output format to dev. Possible values of
              dev are :

              X      X11 output, with direct previewing using dotty(1).

              ps     Postscript output, using dot(1) processor. The drawing
                     will be sized to fill one landscape page.

EXAMPLE
       to print a report from execution of test_hash, run the following
       command:

             $ cc -pg -o test_hash test_hash.c
             $ test_hash < test_data
             $ gprof test_hash | cgprof -Tps | lpr

HISTORY
       cgprof is inspired by a gprof2dot, a similar tool from AT&T Research
       Labs, distributed part of graphviz (http://www.graphviz.org) which
       includes also dot tools.
