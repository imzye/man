bouncesaying(1)         FreeBSD General Commands Manual        bouncesaying(1)

NAME
       bouncesaying - perhaps bounce each incoming message

SYNOPSIS
       in .qmail: |bouncesaying error [ program [ arg ...  ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       bouncesaying feeds each new mail message to program with the given
       arguments.  If program exits 0, bouncesaying prints error and bounces
       the message.

       If program exits 111, bouncesaying exits 111, so delivery will be
       retried later.

       If program exits anything else (or does not exist), bouncesaying exits
       0, so the rest of .qmail will be processed as usual.

       Note that it is not safe for program to fork a child that reads the
       message in the background.

       If program is not supplied, bouncesaying always bounces the message:

          |bouncesaying 'This address no longer accepts mail.'

       WARNING: If you create a .qmail file to enable bouncesaying, make sure
       to also add a line specifying delivery to your normal mailbox.
