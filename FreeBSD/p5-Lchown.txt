Lchown(3)             User Contributed Perl Documentation            Lchown(3)


NAME
       Lchown - use the lchown(2) system call from Perl

SYNOPSIS
         use Lchown;

         lchown $uid, $gid, 'foo' or die "lchown: $!";

         my $count = lchown $uid, $gid, @filenames;

         # or

         use Lchown qw(lchown LCHOWN_AVAILABLE);

         warn "this system lacks the lchown system call\n" unless LCHOWN_AVAILABLE;

         ...

         # or

         use Lchown ();

         warn "this won't work\n" unless Lchown::LCHOWN_AVAILABLE;
         Lchown::lchown $uid, $gid, 'foo' or die "lchown: $!";

DESCRIPTION
       Provides a perl interface to the lchown() system call, on platforms
       that support it.

DEFAULT EXPORTS
       The following symbols are exported be default:

       lchown (LIST)
           Like the "chown" builtin, but using the lchown() system call so
           that symlinks will not be followed.  Returns the number of files
           successfully changed.

           On systems without the lchown() system call, "lchown" always
           returns "undef" and sets "errno" to "ENOSYS" (Function not
           implemented).

ADDITIONAL EXPORTS
       The following symbols are available for export but are not exported by
       default:

       LCHOWN_AVAILABLE ()
           Returns true on platforms with the lchown() system call, and false
           on platforms without.
