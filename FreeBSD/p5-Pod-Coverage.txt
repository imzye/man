NAME
       Pod::Coverage - Checks if the documentation of a module is
       comprehensive

SYNOPSIS
         # in the beginnning...
         perl -MPod::Coverage=Pod::Coverage -e666

         # all in one invocation
         use Pod::Coverage package => 'Fishy';

         # straight OO
         use Pod::Coverage;
         my $pc = Pod::Coverage->new(package => 'Pod::Coverage');
         print "We rock!" if $pc->coverage == 1;

DESCRIPTION
       Developers hate writing documentation.  They'd hate it even more if
       their computer tattled on them, but maybe they'll be even more thankful
       in the long run.  Even if not, perlmodstyle tells you to, so you must
       obey.

       This module provides a mechanism for determining if the pod for a given
       module is comprehensive.

       It expects to find either a "=head(n>1)" or an "=item" block
       documenting a subroutine.

       Consider:
        # an imaginary Foo.pm
        package Foo;

        =item foo

        The foo sub

        = cut

        sub foo {}
        sub bar {}

        1;
        __END__

       In this example "Foo::foo" is covered, but "Foo::bar" is not, so the
       "Foo" package is only 50% (0.5) covered

   Methods
       Pod::Coverage->new(package => $package)
           Creates a new Pod::Coverage object.

           "package" the name of the package to analyse

           "private" an array of regexen which define what symbols are
           regarded as private (and so need not be documented) defaults to [
           qr/^_/, qr/^(un)?import$/, qr/^DESTROY$/, qr/^AUTOLOAD$/,
           qr/^bootstrap$/,
                   qr/^(TIE( SCALAR | ARRAY | HASH | HANDLE ) |
                        FETCH | STORE | UNTIE | FETCHSIZE | STORESIZE |
                        POP | PUSH | SHIFT | UNSHIFT | SPLICE | DELETE |
                        EXISTS | EXTEND | CLEAR | FIRSTKEY | NEXTKEY | PRINT |
           PRINTF |
                        WRITE | READLINE | GETC | READ | CLOSE | BINMODE |
           OPEN |
                        EOF | FILENO | SEEK | TELL | SCALAR )$/x,
                   qr/^( MODIFY | FETCH )_( REF | SCALAR | ARRAY | HASH | CODE
           |
                                            GLOB | FORMAT | IO
           )_ATTRIBUTES$/x,
                   qr/^CLONE(_SKIP)?$/, ]

           This should cover all the usual magical methods for tie()d objects,
           attributes, generally all the methods that are typically not called
           by a user, but instead being used internally by perl.

           "also_private" items are appended to the private list

           "trustme" an array of regexen which define what symbols you just
           want us to assume are properly documented even if we can't find any
           docs for them

           If "pod_from" is supplied, that file is parsed for the
           documentation, rather than using Pod::Find

           If "nonwhitespace" is supplied, then only POD sections which have
           non-whitespace characters will count towards being documented.

       $object->coverage
           Gives the coverage as a value in the range 0 to 1

       $object->why_unrated
           "$object->coverage" may return "undef", to indicate that it was
           unable to deduce coverage for a package.  If this happens you
           should be able to check "why_unrated" to get a useful excuse.

       $object->naked/$object->uncovered
           Returns a list of uncovered routines, will implicitly call coverage
           if it's not already been called.

           Note, private and 'trustme' identifiers will be skipped.

       $object->covered
           Returns a list of covered routines, will implicitly call coverage
           if it's not previously been called.

           As with "naked", private and 'trustme' identifiers will be skipped.

   Debugging support
       In order to allow internals debugging, while allowing the optimiser to
       do its thang, "Pod::Coverage" uses constant subs to define how it
       traces.

       Use them like so

        sub Pod::Coverage::TRACE_ALL () { 1 }
        use Pod::Coverage;

       Supported constants are:

       TRACE_ALL
           Trace everything.

           Well that's all there is so far, are you glad you came?

   Inheritance interface
       These abstract methods while functional in "Pod::Coverage" may make
       your life easier if you want to extend "Pod::Coverage" to fit your
       house style more closely.

       NOTE Please consider this interface as in a state of flux until this
       comment goes away.

       $object->_CvGV($symbol)
           Return the GV for the coderef supplied.  Used by "_get_syms" to
           identify locally defined code.

           You probably won't need to override this one.

       $object->_get_syms($package)
           return a list of symbols to check for from the specified packahe

       _get_pods
           Extract pod markers from the currently active package.

           Return an arrayref or undef on fail.

       _private_check($symbol)
           return true if the symbol should be considered private

       _trustme_check($symbol)
           return true if the symbol is a 'trustme' symbol

BUGS
       Due to the method used to identify documented subroutines
       "Pod::Coverage" may completely miss your house style and declare your
       code undocumented.  Patches and/or failing tests welcome.

TODO
       Widen the rules for identifying documentation
       Improve the code coverage of the test suite.  "Devel::Cover" rocks so
       hard.
