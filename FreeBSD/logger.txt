LOGGER(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              LOGGER(1)

NAME
     logger – make entries in the system log

SYNOPSIS
     logger [-46Ais] [-f file] [-H hostname] [-h host] [-P port] [-p pri]
            [-S addr:port] [-t tag] [message ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The logger utility provides a shell command interface to the syslog(3)
     system log module.

     The following options are available:

     -4      Force logger to use IPv4 addresses only.

     -6      Force logger to use IPv6 addresses only.

     -A      By default, logger tries to send the message to only one address,
             even if the host has more than one A or AAAA record.  If this
             option is specified, logger tries to send the message to all
             addresses.

     -i      Log the process id of the logger process with each line.

     -s      Log the message to standard error, as well as the system log.

     -f file
             Read the contents of the specified file into syslog.  This option
             is ignored when a message is also specified.

     -H hostname
             Set the hostname in the header of the message to specified value.
             If not specified, host part of gethostname(3) will be used.

     -h host
             Send the message to the remote system host instead of logging it
             locally.  Note that logger currently supports AF_INET (IPv4),
             AF_INET6 (IPv6), and AF_LOCAL (Unix-domain socket) address
             families.  The following address formats are valid in host:

             AF_INET   192.168.2.1
             AF_INET6  2001:db8::1
             AF_LOCAL  /var/run/log

     -P port
             Send the message to the specified port number on a remote system,
             which can be specified as a service name or as a decimal number.
             The default is “syslog”.  If an unknown service name is used,
             logger prints a warning and falls back to port 514.

     -p pri  Enter the message with the specified priority.  The priority may
             be specified numerically or as a facility.level pair.  For
             example, “-p local3.info” logs the message(s) as informational
             level in the local3 facility.  The default is “user.notice”.

     -S addr:port
             Specify source address and/or source port when using -h option.
             The same address will be used for all of the remote addresses
             when -A flag is enabled.  Note that a numeric IPv6 address in
             addr must be enclosed with “[” and “]”.

     -t tag  Mark every line in the log with the specified tag rather than the
             default of current login name.

     message
             Write the message to log; if not specified, and the -f flag is
             not provided, standard input is logged.

EXIT STATUS
     The logger utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
           logger System rebooted

           logger -p local0.notice -t HOSTIDM -f /dev/idmc

STANDARDS
     The logger command is expected to be IEEE Std 1003.2 (“POSIX.2”)
     compatible.
