CR_SEEOTHERUIDS(9)     FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual    CR_SEEOTHERUIDS(9)

NAME
     cr_seeotheruids – determine visibility of objects given their user
     credentials

SYNOPSIS
     int
     cr_seeotheruids(struct ucred *u1, struct ucred *u2);

DESCRIPTION
     This function determines the visibility of objects in the kernel based on
     the real user IDs in the credentials u1 and u2 associated with them.

     The visibility of objects is influenced by the sysctl(8) variable
     security.bsd.see_other_uids.  If this variable is non-zero then all
     objects in the kernel are visible to each other irrespective of their
     user IDs.  If this variable is zero then the object with credentials u2
     is visible to the object with credentials u1 if either u1 is the super-
     user credential, or if u1 and u2 have the same real user ID.

SYSCTL VARIABLES
     security.bsd.see_other_uids
             Must be non-zero if objects with unprivileged credentials are to
             be able to see each other.

RETURN VALUES
     This function returns zero if the object with credential u1 can “see” the
     object with credential u2, or ESRCH otherwise.
