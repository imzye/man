NAME
     iflib – Network Interface Driver Framework

DESCRIPTION
     iflib is a framework for writing network interface drivers for FreeBSD.
     It is designed to remove a large amount of the boilerplate that is often
     needed for modern network interface devices, allowing driver authors to
     focus on the specific code needed for their hardware.

     There are three logical components to iflib each of which is described in
     its own manual page.  These are:

     iflibdi(9)       Device-independent functions, used to integrate iflib
                      into the rest of the FreeBSD networking stack.

     iflibdd(9)       Device-dependent functions, used when writing new iflib
                      based drivers.

     iflibtxrx(9)     Device-dependent transmit and receive functions, used
                      when writing new iflib based drivers.
