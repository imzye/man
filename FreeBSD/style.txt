STYLE.LUA(9)           FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual          STYLE.LUA(9)

NAME
     style.lua – FreeBSD lua file style guide

DESCRIPTION
     This file specifies the preferred style for lua source files in the
     FreeBSD source tree.  Many of the style rules are implicit in the
     examples.  Be careful to check the examples before assuming that
     style.lua is silent on an issue.

     The copyright header should be a series of single-line comments.  Use the
     single-line comment style for every line in a multi-line comment.

     After any copyright header, there is a blank line, and the $FreeBSD$
     comment for non-C/C++ source files.

     The preferred method of including other files and modules is with
     require(name), such as:

     -- $FreeBSD$

     config = require("config");
     menu = require("menu");
     password = require("password");
     -- One blank line following the module require block

     include() is generally avoided.

     Indentation and wrapping should match the guidelines provided by
     style(9).  Do note that it is ok to wrap much earlier than 80 columns if
     readability would otherwise suffer.

     Where possible, s:method(...) is preferred to method(s, ...).  This is
     applicable to objects with methods.  String are a commonly-used example
     of objects with methods.

     Testing for nil should be done explicitly, rather than as a boolean
     expression.  Single-line conditional statements and loops should be
     avoided.

     local variables should be preferred to global variables in module scope.
     internal_underscores tend to be preferred for variable identifiers, while
     camelCase tends to be preferred for function identifiers.

     If a table definition spans multiple lines, then the final value in the
     table should include the optional terminating comma.  For example:

     -- No terminating comma needed for trivial table definitions
     local trivial_table = {1, 2, 3, 4}

     local complex_table = {
             {
                     id = "foo",
                     func = foo_function, -- Trailing comma preferred
             },
             {
                     id = "bar",
                     func = bar_function,
             },      -- Trailing comma preferred
     }

     This reduces the chance for errors to be introduced when modifying more
     complex tables.

     Multiple local variables should not be declared and initialized on a
     single line.  Lines containing multiple variable declarations without
     initialization are ok.  Lines containing multiple variable declarations
     initialized to a single function call returning a tuple with the same
     number of values is also ok.

     Initialization should be done at declaration time as appropriate.
