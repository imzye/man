envdir(8)               FreeBSD System Manager's Manual              envdir(8)

NAME
       envdir - runs another program with environment modified according to
       files in a specified directory.

SYNOPSIS
       envdir [ -p prefix ] d child

DESCRIPTION
       d is a single argument.  child consists of one or more arguments.

       envdir sets various environment variables as specified by files in the
       directory named d.  It then runs child.

       If d contains a file named s whose first line is t, envdir removes an
       environment variable named s if one exists, and then adds an
       environment variable named s with value t.  The name s must not contain
       =. Spaces and tabs at the end of t are removed. Nulls in t are changed
       to newlines in the environment variable.

       If the file s is completely empty (0 bytes long), envdir removes an
       environment variable named s if one exists, without adding a new
       variable.

OPTIONS
       -p prefix
              Prefix all environment variable names with prefix.

EXIT CODES
       envdir exits 111 if it has trouble reading d, if it runs out of memory
       for environment variables, or if it cannot run child.  Otherwise its
       exit code is the same as that of child.
