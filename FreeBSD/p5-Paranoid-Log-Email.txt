SYNOPSIS

         startLogger('crit-msg', 'Email', PL_CRIT, PL_GE,

             sender    => $sender,   subject   => $subject });

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements an e-mail transport for messages sent to the
       logger.  It supports one or more recipients as well as overriding the
       sender address and subject line.  It also supports connecting to a
       remote mail server.

       mailhost and recipient are the only mandatory options.

OPTIONS
       The options recognized for use in the options hash are as follows:

           Option      Value       Description
