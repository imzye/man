       catalog

         use Astro::Hipparcos;
         my $catalog = Astro::Hipparcos->new("thefile.dat");
         while (defined(my $record = $catalog->get_record())) {
           print $record->get_HIP(), "\n"; # print record id
         }

         # the twelth record (i.e. first is 1, NOT 0)
         my $specific_record = $catalog->get_record(12);
