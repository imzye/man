PMAP_MAP(9)            FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual           PMAP_MAP(9)

NAME
     pmap_map – map a physical memory range into kernel virtual address (KVA)
     space

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <vm/vm.h>
     #include <vm/pmap.h>

     vm_offset_t
     pmap_map(vm_offset_t *virt, vm_paddr_t start, vm_paddr_t end, int prot);

DESCRIPTION
     The pmap_map() function maps a range of physical addresses into kernel
     virtual address (KVA) space, from start to end, with protection bits
     prot.

     The value passed in *virt is treated as a hint for the virtual address of
     the beginning of the mapping.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
     The prot argument is currently ignored by machine-dependent
     implementations.

     Architectures which can support a direct mapped physical to virtual
     region can return the appropriate address within that region, leaving
     *virt unchanged.

RETURN VALUES
     The pmap_map() function returns the virtual address of the beginning of
     the mapping, if the mapping was successfully made; *virt will also be
     updated with the first usable address after the mapped region.

     If the function is unsuccessful, NULL is returned.
