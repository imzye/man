MP3PLOT(1)                    mp3plot User Manual                   MP3PLOT(1)



NAME
       mp3plot - creates a plot of the bitrate distribution of MP3 files

SYNOPSIS
       mp3plot [-i] {input.mp3}

       mp3plot [-g] [-i] {input.mp3} [-p plotter_name] [-o output.png]

       mp3plot [{-h | --help} | {-V | --version}]

DESCRIPTION
       mp3plot creates a plot (textual or graphical) of the bitrate
       distribution of an MP3 file; i.e. it displays which proportion of the
       audio file uses each of the possible bitrates.

       The plot can serve e.g. to compare an audio source as encoded by
       different encoders or settings; or to display how the chosen (average)
       bitrate was achieved by the encoder.

       By default the plot is printed to the console. If mp3plot is compiled
       with the appropriate libraries, it can also create a graphical plot in
       a png image.

OPTIONS
       The program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
       options starting with two dashes (`-´). A summary of options is
       included below.

       [-i] inputfile.mp3, [--input] inputfile.mp3
           Plot inputfile.mp3.


           -i / --input is implied if not used (e.g.

               $ mp3plot -i input.mp3

           is equivalent to

               $ mp3plot input.mp3


       -o output.png, --output output.png
           Save plot image to output.png.

           Ignored if the console plotter is used. If omitted will default to
           the input filename with ".png" appended.

       -g, --image
           Output to a png image file.

           By default the png will be named after the mp3 file and placed on
           the same directory as it, e.g. "/music/some file.mp3" will produce
           "/music/some file.mp3.png". Use --output to choose the output
           filename.

       -p plotter_name, --named-plotter plotter_name
           Choose the plotter with plotter_name.

           Only required to hand-pick an image plotter when both GD and Magick
           plotters have been compiled in. Use "list" to display a list of
           available plotters, e.g.:

               $ mp3plot -p list

               Avilable plotters:
               * console: textual, printed
               * magick: graphical, file output
               * gd: graphical, file output



           By default, when a plotter is not explicitly chosen, if -g is used
           an image plotter will be chosen (magick if present, gd otherwise).
           When -g isn´t used, the console plotter will be used.


           console is always available, while both magick and gd can be
           included or excluded at the time of compilation.

           If a plotter not available is requested, mp3plot will exit with an
           error. e.g. if the Magick module wasn´t compiled in:

               $ mp3plot -p magick



               [...]

               mp3plot: No plotter with such name available</screen>


       -h, --help
           Show summary of options.

       -V, --version
           Show version of program and extra compilation information
           (libraries used, their versions, compilation date and compiler).

       --old-colourscheme, --old-colorscheme
           Use the older set of colours (used up 0.5.0) for graphical plot
           output.
