GAUCHE-CESCONV(1)               Gauche Commands              GAUCHE-CESCONV(1)

NAME
       gauche-cesconv - convert text from one character encoding scheme to
       another

SYNOPSIS
       gauche-cesconv [-h] [-f encoding] [-t encoding] [-o outfile] [infile]

DESCRIPTION
       The gauche-cesconv command is a program to convert text from one
       character encoding scheme (CES) to another, using Gauche's character
       conversion module.  Hence the supported character sets are the same as
       Gauche's.  See the info document of Gauche for more details.

       There are other commands that provide the same functionality and more,
       such as iconv(1) or nkf(1), but they are not universally available by
       default.  This command is provided for Gauche's external packages to
       ease the installation and configuration process; for those packages, it
       is certain that gauche-cesconv is available, so they don't need to
       check availability of iconv etc.

       When infile is omitted, the text is read from standard input.

OPTIONS
       -f, --from-code=encoding
           Selects input encoding. Can be ´*JP´ to guess the character
           encoding from japanese text, among either ISO2022-JP(-1,2,3),
           EUCJP, SHIFT_JIS or UTF-8.  If omitted, gauche´s native CES is
           used.

       -h, --help
           Show summary of options.

       -o, --output=outfile
           Place output in file outfile. If omitted the converted text is
           written to standard output.

       -t, --to-code=encoding
           Selects output encoding. (see also --from-code)

DIAGNOSTICS
       gauche-cesconv exits with status 0 on success.
