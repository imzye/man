NAME
     ctl.conf – CAM Target Layer / iSCSI target daemon configuration file

DESCRIPTION
     The ctl.conf configuration file is used by the ctld(8) daemon.  Lines
     starting with ‘#’ are interpreted as comments.  The general syntax of the
     ctl.conf file is:

           pidfile path

           auth-group name {
                 chap user secret
                 ...
           }

           portal-group name {
                 listen address
                 discovery-auth-group name
                 ...
           }

           target name {
                 auth-group name
                 portal-group name
                 lun number {
                      path path
                 }
                 ...
           }

   Global Context
     auth-group name
             Create an auth-group configuration context, defining a new auth-
             group, which can then be assigned to any number of targets.

     debug level
             The debug verbosity level.  The default is 0.

     maxproc number
             The limit for concurrently running child processes handling
             incoming connections.  The default is 30.  A setting of 0
             disables the limit.

     pidfile path
             The path to the pidfile.  The default is /var/run/ctld.pid.

     portal-group name
             Create a portal-group configuration context, defining a new
             portal-group, which can then be assigned to any number of
             targets.

     lun name
             Create a lun configuration context, defining a LUN to be exported
             by any number of targets.

     target name
             Create a target configuration context, which can optionally
             contain one or more lun contexts.

     timeout seconds
             The timeout for login sessions, after which the connection will
             be forcibly terminated.  The default is 60.  A setting of 0
             disables the timeout.

     isns-server address
             An IPv4 or IPv6 address and optionally port of iSNS server to
             register on.

     isns-period seconds
             iSNS registration period.  Registered Network Entity not updated
             during this period will be unregistered.  The default is 900.

     isns-timeout seconds
             Timeout for iSNS requests.  The default is 5.

   auth-group Context
     auth-type type
             Sets the authentication type.  Type can be either "none", "deny",
             "chap", or "chap-mutual".  In most cases it is not necessary to
             set the type using this clause; it is usually used to disable
             authentication for a given auth-group.

     chap user secret
             A set of CHAP authentication credentials.  Note that for any
             auth-group, the configuration may only contain either chap or
             chap-mutual entries; it is an error to mix them.

     chap-mutual user secret mutualuser mutualsecret
             A set of mutual CHAP authentication credentials.  Note that for
             any auth-group, the configuration may only contain either chap or
             chap-mutual entries; it is an error to mix them.

     initiator-name initiator-name
             An iSCSI initiator name.  Only initiators with a name matching
             one of the defined names will be allowed to connect.  If not
             defined, there will be no restrictions based on initiator name.

     initiator-portal address[/prefixlen]
             An iSCSI initiator portal: an IPv4 or IPv6 address, optionally
             followed by a literal slash and a prefix length.  Only initiators
             with an address matching one of the defined addresses will be
             allowed to connect.  If not defined, there will be no
             restrictions based on initiator address.

   portal-group Context
     discovery-auth-group name
             Assign a previously defined authentication group to the portal
             group, to be used for target discovery.  By default, portal
             groups are assigned predefined auth-group "default", which denies
             discovery.  Another predefined auth-group, "no-authentication",
             may be used to permit discovery without authentication.

     discovery-filter filter
             Determines which targets are returned during discovery.  Filter
             can be either "none", "portal", "portal-name", or
             "portal-name-auth".  When set to "none", discovery will return
             all targets assigned to that portal group.  When set to "portal",
             discovery will not return targets that cannot be accessed by the
             initiator because of their initiator-portal.  When set to
             "portal-name", the check will include both initiator-portal and
             initiator-name.  When set to "portal-name-auth", the check will
             include initiator-portal, initiator-name, and authentication
             credentials.  The target is returned if it does not require CHAP
             authentication, or if the CHAP user and secret used during
             discovery match those used by the target.  Note that when using
             "portal-name-auth", targets that require CHAP authentication will
             only be returned if discovery-auth-group requires CHAP.  The
             default is "none".

     listen address
             An IPv4 or IPv6 address and port to listen on for incoming
             connections.

     offload driver
             Define iSCSI hardware offload driver to use for this
             portal-group.  The default is "none".

     option name value
             The CTL-specific port options passed to the kernel.

     redirect address
             IPv4 or IPv6 address to redirect initiators to.  When configured,
             all initiators attempting to connect to portal belonging to this
             portal-group will get redirected using "Target moved temporarily"
             login response.  Redirection happens before authentication and
             any initiator-name or initiator-portal checks are skipped.

     tag value
             Unique 16-bit tag value of this portal-group.  If not specified,
             the value is generated automatically.

     foreign
             Specifies that this portal-group is listened by some other host.
             This host will announce it on discovery stage, but won't listen.

     dscp value
             The DiffServ Codepoint used for sending data. The DSCP can be set
             to numeric, or hexadecimal values directly, as well as the well-
             defined "CSx" and "AFxx" codepoints.

     pcp value
             The 802.1Q Priority CodePoint used for sending packets.  The PCP
             can be set to a value in the range between "0" to "7".  When
             omitted, the default for the outgoing interface is used.

   target Context
     alias text
             Assign a human-readable description to the target.  There is no
             default.

     auth-group name
             Assign a previously defined authentication group to the target.
             By default, targets that do not specify their own auth settings,
             using clauses such as chap or initiator-name, are assigned
             predefined auth-group "default", which denies all access.
             Another predefined auth-group, "no-authentication", may be used
             to permit access without authentication.  Note that this clause
             can be overridden using the second argument to a portal-group
             clause.

     auth-type type
             Sets the authentication type.  Type can be either "none", "deny",
             "chap", or "chap-mutual".  In most cases it is not necessary to
             set the type using this clause; it is usually used to disable
             authentication for a given target.  This clause is mutually
             exclusive with auth-group; one cannot use both in a single
             target.

     chap user secret
             A set of CHAP authentication credentials.  Note that targets must
             only use one of auth-group, chap, or chap-mutual; it is a
             configuration error to mix multiple types in one target.

     chap-mutual user secret mutualuser mutualsecret
             A set of mutual CHAP authentication credentials.  Note that
             targets must only use one of auth-group, chap, or chap-mutual; it
             is a configuration error to mix multiple types in one target.

     initiator-name initiator-name
             An iSCSI initiator name.  Only initiators with a name matching
             one of the defined names will be allowed to connect.  If not
             defined, there will be no restrictions based on initiator name.
             This clause is mutually exclusive with auth-group; one cannot use
             both in a single target.

     initiator-portal address[/prefixlen]
             An iSCSI initiator portal: an IPv4 or IPv6 address, optionally
             followed by a literal slash and a prefix length.  Only initiators
             with an address matching one of the defined addresses will be
             allowed to connect.  If not defined, there will be no
             restrictions based on initiator address.  This clause is mutually
             exclusive with auth-group; one cannot use both in a single
             target.

             The auth-type, chap, chap-mutual, initiator-name, and
             initiator-portal clauses in the target context provide an
             alternative to assigning an auth-group defined separately, useful
             in the common case of authentication settings specific to a
             single target.

     portal-group name [ag-name]
             Assign a previously defined portal group to the target.  The
             default portal group is "default", which makes the target
             available on TCP port 3260 on all configured IPv4 and IPv6
             addresses.  Optional second argument specifies auth-group for
             connections to this specific portal group.  If second argument is
             not specified, target auth-group is used.

     port name

     port name/pp

     port name/pp/vp
             Assign specified CTL port (such as "isp0" or "isp2/1") to the
             target.  This is used to export the target through a specific
             physical - eg Fibre Channel - port, in addition to portal-groups
             configured for the target.  Use ctladm portlist command to
             retrieve the list of available ports.  On startup ctld(8)
             configures LUN mapping and enables all assigned ports.  Each port
             can be assigned to only one target.

     redirect address
             IPv4 or IPv6 address to redirect initiators to.  When configured,
             all initiators attempting to connect to this target will get
             redirected using "Target moved temporarily" login response.
             Redirection happens after successful authentication.

     lun number name
             Export previously defined lun by the parent target.

     lun number
             Create a lun configuration context, defining a LUN exported by
             the parent target.

             This is an alternative to defining the LUN separately, useful in
             the common case of a LUN being exported by a single target.

   lun Context
     backend block | ramdisk
             The CTL backend to use for a given LUN.  Valid choices are
             "block" and "ramdisk"; block is used for LUNs backed by files or
             disk device nodes; ramdisk is a bitsink device, used mostly for
             testing.  The default backend is block.

     blocksize size
             The blocksize visible to the initiator.  The default blocksize is
             512 for disks, and 2048 for CD/DVDs.

     ctl-lun lun_id
             Global numeric identifier to use for a given LUN inside CTL.  By
             default CTL allocates those IDs dynamically, but explicit
             specification may be needed for consistency in HA configurations.

     device-id string
             The SCSI Device Identification string presented to the initiator.

     device-type type
             Specify the SCSI device type to use when creating the LUN.
             Currently CTL supports Direct Access (type 0), Processor (type 3)
             and CD/DVD (type 5) LUNs.

     option name value
             The CTL-specific options passed to the kernel.  All CTL-specific
             options are documented in the OPTIONS section of ctladm(8).

     path path
             The path to the file, device node, or zfs(8) volume used to back
             the LUN.  For optimal performance, create the volume with the
             "volmode=dev" property set.

     serial string
             The SCSI serial number presented to the initiator.

     size size
             The LUN size, in bytes or by number with a suffix of K, M, G, T
             (for kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, or terabytes).  When the
             configuration is in UCL format, use the suffix format kKmMgG|bB,
             (i.e., 4GB, 4gb, and 4Gb are all equivalent).

FILES
     /etc/ctl.conf      The default location of the ctld(8) configuration
                        file.
