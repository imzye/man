DWARF_GET_SECTION_MAX_OFFSETS(3)              FreeBSD Library Functions Manual

NAME
     dwarf_get_section_max_offsets, dwarf_get_section_max_offsets_b – return
     the size of DWARF sections

LIBRARY
     DWARF Access Library (libdwarf, -ldwarf)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <libdwarf.h>

     int
     dwarf_get_section_max_offsets(Dwarf_Debug dbg,
         Dwarf_Unsigned *debug_info, Dwarf_Unsigned *debug_abbrev,
         Dwarf_Unsigned *debug_line, Dwarf_Unsigned *debug_loc,
         Dwarf_Unsigned *debug_aranges, Dwarf_Unsigned *debug_macinfo,
         Dwarf_Unsigned *debug_pubnames, Dwarf_Unsigned *debug_str,
         Dwarf_Unsigned *debug_frame, Dwarf_Unsigned *debug_ranges,
         Dwarf_Unsigned *debug_pubtypes);

     int
     dwarf_get_section_max_offsets_b(Dwarf_Debug dbg,
         Dwarf_Unsigned *debug_info, Dwarf_Unsigned *debug_abbrev,
         Dwarf_Unsigned *debug_line, Dwarf_Unsigned *debug_loc,
         Dwarf_Unsigned *debug_aranges, Dwarf_Unsigned *debug_macinfo,
         Dwarf_Unsigned *debug_pubnames, Dwarf_Unsigned *debug_str,
         Dwarf_Unsigned *debug_frame, Dwarf_Unsigned *debug_ranges,
         Dwarf_Unsigned *debug_pubtypes, Dwarf_Unsigned *debug_types);

DESCRIPTION
     Function dwarf_get_section_max_offsets_b() retrieves the sizes of the
     DWARF sections in a DWARF debug context.  Argument dbg should reference a
     DWARF debug context allocated using dwarf_init(3).  The function stores
     the size of each DWARF section to the location pointed to by the argument
     corresponding to the section name.  If a DWARF section does not exist,
     the location pointed to by the argument corresponding to that section
     will be set to zero.

     A value of NULL may be used for any of the arguments debug_info,
     debug_abbrev, debug_line, debug_loc, debug_aranges, debug_macinfo,
     debug_pubnames, debug_str, debug_frame, debug_ranges, debug_pubtypes and
     debug_types if the caller is not interested in the respective section
     size.

     Function dwarf_get_section_max_offsets() is identical to function
     dwarf_get_section_max_offsets_b() except that it does not provide
     argument debug_types, and thus cannot return the size of the
     “.debug_types” section.

RETURN VALUES
     On success, these functions return DW_DLV_OK.  If argument dbg is NULL,
     they return DW_DLV_ERROR.
