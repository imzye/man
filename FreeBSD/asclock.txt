NAME
       asclock - the AfterStep clock

SYNOPSIS
       asclock [ -help] [-12 | -24] [-shape]
               [-position [+|-]x[+|-]y]
               [-exe program]
               [-led color]
               [-noblink] [-iconic]

DESCRIPTION
       The asclock is a clock written to emulate the date/time application on
       the NEXTSTEP(tm) operating system.  asclock supports multiple
       languages, military and AM/PM time formats, program execution, and the
       shape extention to X-Windows.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
       -help
              prints the usage message:
                      usage:  asclock [-options ...]
                      where options include:
                          -12                     12 hour format
                          -24                     24 hour format
                          -exe <program>          program to start on click
                          -led <color>            color of the led
                          -position [+|-]x[+|-]y  position of asclock
                          -shape                  without groundplate
                          -noblink                don't blink
                          -iconic                 start up as icon

       -12 or -24
              sets the desired time format to either twelve hour with AM/PM (
              -12 ) or military time ( -24 ).  If no option is given military
              time is used.

       -shape
              turn on shaped window support for asclock.  When this is turned
              on the asclock windows will only appear to be the led and date
              pad.  By default shaped windows are turned off and the clock
              will appear on a 64 pixel by 64 pixel base.

       -led <color>
              specifies the color of the led. To find out what colors are
              available, try showrgb

       -position [+|-]x[+|-]y
              specifies the starting position of asclock. The [+|-] works like
              the standard X-Windows x/y geometry option.

       -exe <program>
              specifies the application to start when the pointer is activated
              over asclock. To invoke applications with parameters, you have
              to set quotes around the command. See example below...

       -noblink
              specifies if asclock should blink.

       -iconic
              This gives weird output with AfterStep, so don't bother. It's
              for mwm and other wm's with no hint functionality.

INVOCATION
       asclock can be called from one of many ways.  The most common
       invocation is the command line:

            [user@host] ~% asclock -12 -exe 'xlock -mode hop' &

       Another way to call asclock is from the window manager:

            *Wharf - - MaxSwallow "asclock"    asclock -shape -12&



       This line, when placed in the .steprc file in the users home directory
       will cause asclock to use the shape extensions so that it will be a
       button on the Wharf (1) button bar under the afterstep (1) window
       manager.

BUGS
       we don't have bugs :)
