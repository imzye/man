DESCRIPTION
   GENERAL PRINCIPLES
       This module helps to tests many parameters at once.  In general, it
       calls the given subroutine with every combination of the given
       parameter values.  The combinations are created with building a cross
       product.

       Especially it avoids writing ugly, boring code like:

         my $ok = 1;
         foreach my $x ($arg1a, $arg2a) {
             foreach my $y ($arg2a, $arg2b, $arg3b, $arg4b) {
                 $ok &&= foo($x,$y);
             }
         }
         ok $ok, $testname;

       Instead you simpler write

         all_ok {foo(@_)}
                [ [$arg1a, $arg2a], [$arg2b, $arg2b, $arg3b, $arg4b] ]
                $testname;

       Additionally the output contains also some useful information about the
       parameters that should be tested and the first parameters the test
       failed. E.g.

         all_ok {$_[0] != 13 and $_[1] != 13}
                [ [1 .. 100], [1 .. 100] ],
                "No double bad luck";

       would print:

         not ok 1 - No double bad luck
         #     Failed test (x.pl at line 5)
         # Tests with the parameters: $VAR1=[[10,11,12,13,14,15],[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]];
         # Failed first using these parameters: $VAR1=[10,13];

       The parameters passed to "all_ok" can be passed in two ways.  If you
       need to test a crossproduct of more than one parameterlist, you have to
       write it as

         all_ok CODE [ \@arglist1, \@arglist2, ..., \@arglistn ], TEST_NAME;

       The CODE-routine will be called with every combination of the arglists,
       passed as simple arguments. E.g.

         all_ok {foo(@_)} [ ["red", "green", "blue"], ["big", "medium", "little"] ];

       would call

         foo("red","big");
         foo("red","medium");
         foo("red","little");
         foo("green","big");
         foo("green","medium");
         foo("green","little");
         foo("blue","big");
         foo("blue","medium");
         foo("blue","little");

       Note, that the order of calling shouldn't play any role, as it could be
       changed in future versions without any notice about.

       Please always remember, that a crossproduct of the lists can be very,
       very big.  So don't write something like "all_ok {&foo} [ [1 .. 32000],
       [1 .. 32000], [1 .. 32000] ]", as it would test 32_768_000_000_000
       parameter combinations.

       If you only want to test one parameter with different values, you can
       write in general

         all_ok CODE \@values, TEST_NAME

       So "all_ok {&foo} [1,2,3]" would call "foo(1); foo(2); foo(3)".  (In
       this way and only in this, $_ will be set to the passed argument.
        Thus it is "$_ = $_[0]" in this special case.
        Reason for this behaviour is just convenience.)

       Please take care, that the first element of the values list isn't an
       array ref, as Test::ManyParams would assume that you want to test
       combinations of the above.  If it is important to pass values that are
       array refs, you have to write it this way:

         my @values = ( [1 .. 10],
                        [100 .. 110],
                        [990 .. 1000] );
         all_ok {&foo} [ [@values] ];

         # calls foo(1), ... foo(10), foo(100), ..., foo(110), foo(990), ..., foo(1000)

       what is very different to

         all_ok {&foo} [ @values ];

         # what would call foo(1,100,900), foo(1,100,901), ...

       Of course, the test name is always optional, but recommended.

   FUNCTIONS
       all_ok  CODE  PARAMETERS,  [ TEST_NAME ]
           See the general comments.

       all_are  CODE  VALUE,  PARAMETERS,  [ TEST_NAME ]
           The equivalent to "Test::More"'s "is" method.  The given subroutine
           has to return always the given value.  They are compared with 'eq'.

       all_arent  CODE  VALUE,  PARAMETERS,  [ TEST_NAME ]
           The equivalent to "Test::More"'s "isnt" method.  The given
           subroutine has to return always values different from the given
           one.  They are compared with 'eq'.

       any_ok  CODE  PARAMETERS,  [ TEST_NAME ]
           Returns whether the subroutine returns true for one of the given
           parameters.

       any_is  CODE  VALUE,  PARAMETERS, [ TEST_NAME ]
           Returns whether there is at least one parameter (combination) for
           that the given subroutine results the specified value.

       any_isnt CODE  VALUE,  PARAMETERS, [ TEST_NAME ]
           Returns whether there is at least one parameter (combination) for
           that the given subroutine results to a value different to the
           specified one.

       most_ok  CODE  PARAMETERS  =>  NR_OF_TESTS  [, TEST_NAME]
           Tests NR_OF_TESTS (randomly choosen) parameter (combinations) of
           the given parameters. All the (randomly choosen) parameters have to
           let the subroutine results to true.

           This method is intended to used, when a full test would need to
           long and you want to avoid systematic mistakes.

           There could be some parameter (combinations), that are tested twice
           or more often.

   IMPORTING
       In the most cases, you will simply import this module ("use
       Test::ManyParams").

       But when you want to set the seed for the randomization of the
       "most_ok" method, the way for importing looks like "use
       Test::ManyParams seed =" 42>.

       At the time, it only will call srand(42), but later on, it will hold
       foreach test script and file it's own random numbers, so that several
       modules all using this Test::ManyParams module won't collide.

       If you don't seet a seed value, at default the "time ^ $$" value will
       be taken as seed (the default value could be changed in future versions
       without any notice).  That's not a very good seed, but I hope it will
       be good and quick enough for the most cases.

       You can access the setted seed with the variable
       $Test::ManyParams::seed. That's a non-exported, readonly variable.

       Please take care only to import Test::ManyParams one times in one
       package, as the use command is executed while compile time and so
       different seedings will be confusing.

   EXPORT
       "all_ok" "all_are" "all_arent" "any_is" "any_isnt" "most_ok"

BUGS
       The representation of the parameters uses Data::Dumper.  As this module
       neither set $Data::Dumper::Indent, nor reads it out, setting
       $Data::Dumper::Indent to some strange values can destroy a useful
       parameter outprint.  I don't plan to fix this behaviour in the next
       time, as I there a more important things to do.  (Who changes global
       variables harvest what he/she/it has seed.)

       The "most_ok" method is hard to test.  I wrote some tests that helped
       to remove the obviously bugs, but there could be some subtle bugs.
       Especially I didn't test what happens, if you try to test more
       parameters than there could be.

       There are perhaps many mistakes in this documentation.

       Please tell me everything you can find.

TODO
       There are a lot of methods I'd like to implement still.  The most of
       them are simple Here's a list of them:

       all_are_deeply  CODE  SCALAR,  PARAMETERS, [ TEST_NAME ]
       all_like CODE  REGEXP, PARAMETERS, [ TEST_NAME ]
       all_unlike CODE  REGEXP, PARAMETERS, [ TEST_NAME ]
       all_can CODE  REGEXP, PARAMETERS, [ TEST_NAME ]
       all_dies_ok CODE  PARAMETERS, [TEST_NAME]
       all_lives_ok CODE  PARAMETERS, [TEST_NAME]
       all_throws_ok CODE  REGEXP, PARAMETERS, [TEST_NAME]

       Similar methods are planned with the prefix any_.

       The "most_ok" method should accept also a percentage rate and a time
       slot or ... for specification of how many tests should be run.  Typical
       examples for that could be '1000', '1%', '5s', '100 + bounds'.

       The pro and contra of had been discussed a bit on perl.qa.  One of the
       results is that random parameter tests are very sensful, but the
       reproducibility is very important.  So the module has to seed (or
       recognise the seed) of the random generator and to give the possibility
       to set them (e.g. with "use Test::ManyParams seed =" 42>).  Recognising
       a failed test, this seed has to be printed.  It always seems to be
       sensful to set an own random numbering for each package using this
       module.  The last part still has to be done.

       That's only a short synopsis of this discussion, it will be better
       explained when these features are built in.

       Of course, there will be also some methods like
       "most_are","most_arent",... .
