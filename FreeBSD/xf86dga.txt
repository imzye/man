NAME
       dga - test program for the XFree86-DGA extension

SYNOPSIS
       dga

DESCRIPTION
       Dga is a simple test client for the XFree86-DGA extension.  It fills
       the screen with a different colour for each key pressed.  It prints
       some basic framebuffer parameters, and also keyboard and pointer events
       to stdout.  To exit, hit the `q' key.  Hitting the `b' key runs a
       simple benchmark, measuring raw framebuffer write and read speed (this
       takes one second each).
