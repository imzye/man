NAME
     zfs-bookmark – create bookmark of ZFS snapshot

SYNOPSIS
     zfs bookmark snapshot|bookmark newbookmark

DESCRIPTION
     Creates a new bookmark of the given snapshot or bookmark.  Bookmarks mark
     the point in time when the snapshot was created, and can be used as the
     incremental source for a zfs send.

     When creating a bookmark from an existing redaction bookmark, the
     resulting bookmark is not a redaction bookmark.

     This feature must be enabled to be used.  See zpool-features(7) for
     details on ZFS feature flags and the bookmarks feature.
