VIPS(1)                 FreeBSD General Commands Manual                VIPS(1)

NAME
       vips - run vips operations from the command line

SYNOPSIS
       vips [options] [command] [command-options] [command-args]

DESCRIPTION
       vips(1) is the VIPS universal main program. You can use it to run any
       VIPS operation from the command line, to query the VIPS class
       hierarchy, and to maintain parts of the VIPS library.

       To run a VIPS operation, the first argument should be the name of the
       operation and following arguments should be the operation arguments.
       For example:

         $ vips invert lena.v lena2.v


OPTIONS
       -l BASE-NAME, --list=BASE-NAME
              List operations below BASE-NAME. This prints a one-line summary
              of every operation in vips below the class BASE-NAME, where
              BASE-NAME may be a full vips class name, or a nickname.

              If BASE-NAME is not supplied, this will list all classes below
              VipsOperation.


       -p PLUGIN, --plugin=PLUGIN
              Load PLUGIN. Note that plugins in $VIPSHOME/lib/vips-plugins-
              MAJOR.MINOR are loaded automatically.


       -v, --version
              Show VIPS version.


       -c NAME, --completion NAME
              Print completions for NAME


COMMANDS
       operation-name operation-arguments
              Execute a named operation, for example add.
