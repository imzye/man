SND_MAESTRO3(4)        FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual        SND_MAESTRO3(4)

NAME
     snd_maestro3 – ESS Maestro3/Allegro-1 bridge device driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device sound
           device snd_maestro3

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           snd_maestro3_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The snd_maestro3 driver provides support for the ESS Maestro3 and
     Allegro-1 sound chips under the PCM framework.  These chips are mostly
     found in laptop computers and feature an AC97 mixer, a multi-channel
     sample rate converter that can mix up to four digital audio streams in
     hardware, recording support, and external volume control buttons.

     The firmware for the sound processor is licensed under the GNU Public
     License, and thus this driver is not included in the default GENERIC
     kernel.

HARDWARE
     The snd_maestro3 driver supports the following audio devices:

     •   ESS Technology Allegro-1
     •   ESS Technology Maestro3

DIAGNOSTICS
     The hardware volume control buttons can be connected to two different pin
     sets (GPIO or GD) on the chip, depending on the manufacturer.  The driver
     has no way of determining this configuration, so a hint may be used to
     override the default guess.  The default setting for hardware volume
     control assumes that GD pins are wired to control the hardware volume.
     For systems that have the GPIO pins wired to the hardware volume control
     buttons, add the line “hint.pcm.0.hwvol_config="0"” to the file
     /boot/device.hints to override the default setting.

HISTORY
     The snd_maestro3 driver first appeared in FreeBSD 4.3.
