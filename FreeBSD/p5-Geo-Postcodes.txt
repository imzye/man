NAME
       Geo::Postcodes - Base class for the Geo::Postcodes::* modules

SYNOPSIS
       This module should not be used directly from application programs, but
       from a country subclass; e.g.:

        package Geo::Postcodes::U2;

        use Geo::Postcodes 0.30;
        use base qw(Geo::Postcodes);

        use strict;
        use warnings;

        our $VERSION = '0.30';

       And so on. See the documentation for making country subclasses for the
       gory details; perldoc Geo::Postcodes::Subclass or man
       Geo::Postcodes::Subclass.

ABSTRACT
       Geo::Postcodes - Base class for the Geo::Postcodes::* modules. It is
       useless on its own.

PROCEDURES AND METHODS
       These procedures and methods should, with a few exceptions, not be used
       directly, but from a country module. See the documentation for the
       indiviual country modules for usage details.

   address, borough, county, location, owner, postcode, type, type_verbose
       Methods for accessing the fields of a postcode object. The individual
       country modules can support as many of them as needed, and add new
       ones.

   address_of, borough_of, county_of, location_of, owner_of, postcode_of,
       type_of, type_verbose_of
       Procedures that returns the value of the corresponding field for the
       given postcode.  They will return undef if the postcode does not exist,
       or the field is without value for the given postcode.

   get_fields, is_field
       get_fields() will return a list of all the fields supported by the
       module, and is_field($field) will return true (1) if the specified
       field is supported by the module.

   legal, valid
       Procedures that return true if the postcode is legal (syntactically),
       or valid (in actual use).

   new
       This will create a new postcode object.

   selection, selection_loop
       Procedures/methods for selecting several postcodes at once.

       See the selection manual (perldoc Geo::Postcodes::Selection or man
       Geo::Postcodes::Selection) for usage details, and the tutorial (perldoc
       Geo::Postcodes::Tutorial or man Geo::Postcodes::Tutorial) for sample
       code.

   verify_selectionlist, is_legal_selectionmode,
       is_legal_initial_selectionmode get_selectionmodes,
       get_initial_selectionmodes
       Supporting procedures when using selection or selection_loop.

       See the selection manual; perldoc Geo::Postcodes::Selection or man
       Geo::Postcodes::Selection for usage details.

   get_postcodes
       This will return an unsorted list of all the postcodes.

   get_types
       This will return a list of types.  See the next section.

   type2verbose
         my $type_as_english_text  = $Geo::Postcodes::type2verbose($type);
         my $type_as_national_text = $Geo::Postcodes::U2:type2verbose($type);

       This procedure gives an english description of the type. Use the child
       class directly for a description in the native language.

TYPE
       This class defines the following types for the postal locations:

       BX  Post Office box

       ST  Street address

       SX  Service box (as a Post Office box, but the mail is delivered to the
           customer).

       IO  Individual owner (a company with its own postcode).

       STBX
           Either a Street address (ST) or a Post Office box (BX)

       MU  Multiple usage (a mix of the other types)

       PP  Porto Paye receiver (mail where the reicever will pay the postage).

       PN  Place name

       The child classes can use them all, or only a subset, but must not
       define their own additions. The child classes are responsible for
       adding descriptions in the native language, if appropriate.

DESCRIPTION
       This is the base class for the Geo::Postcodes::* modules.

CAVEAT
       This module uses inside out objects, see for instance
       <http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/UnixReview/col63.html> for a
       discussion of the concept.

SEE ALSO
       See also the selection manual (perldoc Geo::Postcodes::Selection or man
       Geo::Postcodes::Selection) for usage details, the tutorial (perldoc
       Geo::Postcodes::Tutorial or man Geo::Postcodes::Tutorial) for sample
       code, and the ajax tutorial (perldoc Geo::Postcodes::Ajax or man
       Geo::Postcodes::Ajax) for information on using the modules in
       combination with ajax code in a html form to get the location updated
       automatically.

       The latest version of this library should always be available on CPAN,
       but see also the library home page; http://bbop.org/perl/GeoPostcodes
       for additional information and sample usage. The child classes that can
       be found there have some sample programs.
