NAME
       Astro::Telescope - class for obtaining telescope information

SYNOPSIS
         use Astro::Telescope;

         $tel = new Astro::Telescope( 'UKIRT' );

         $latitude = $tel->lat;
         $longitude = $tel->long;
         $altitude = $tel->alt;

         %limits = $tel->limits;

         @telescopes = Astro::Telescope->telNames();

DESCRIPTION
       A class for handling properties of individual telescopes such as
       longitude, latitude, height and observational limits.

METHODS
   Constructor
       new Create a new telescope object. Takes the telescope abbreviation as
           the single argument.

             $tel = new Astro::Telescope( 'VLA' );

           An argument must be supplied. Returns "undef" if the telescope is
           not recognized.

           If more than one argument is supplied the assumption is that the
           user is supplying telescope details. In that case, "Name" and
           "Long" must be supplied, and either the geodetic latitude and
           altitude ("Lat" and "Alt" -- but if "Alt" is not supplied it will
           default to zero and this class will issue a warning), the
           geocentric latitude and distance ("GeocLat" and "GeocDist"), or the
           parallax coefficients ("Parallax") must be supplied. Latitudes and
           longitudes must be given in radians, altitude and distance in
           metres, and the parallax constants in units of Earth radii.

             $tel = new Astro::Telescope('telescope');
             $tel = new Astro::Telescope(Name => 'JCMT', Long => $long, Lat => $lat );

   Accessor Methods
       name
           Returns the abbreviated name of the telescope. This is the same as
           that given to the constructor (although it will be upper-cased).

           The object can be reconfigured to a new telescope by supplying a
           new abbreviation to this method.

             $tel->name('JCMT');

           The object will not change state if the name is not known.

       fullname
           Returns the full name of the telescope. For example, if the
           abbreviated name is "JCMT" this will return "JCMT 15 metre".

       obscode
           Returns or sets the IAU observatory code as listed at
           http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/lists/ObsCodes.html. The object will
           not change state if the observatory code is not known.

       long
           Longitude of the telescope (east +ve). By default this is in
           radians.

           An argument of "d" or "s" can be supplied to retrieve the value in
           decimal degrees or sexagesimal string format respectively.

            $string = $tel->long("s");

       lat Geodetic latitude of the telescope. By default this is in radians.

           An argument of "d" or "s" can be supplied to retrieve the value in
           decimal degrees or sexagesimal string format respectively.

             $deg = $tel->lat("d");

       alt Altitude of the telescope in metres above mean sea level.

       parallax
           Return the parallax constants, rho*sin(phi') and rho*cos(phi'),
           where rho is the geocentric radius in Earth radii and phi' is the
           geocentric latitude. Returned as a hash where 'Par_C' is
           rho*sin(phi') and 'Par_S' is rho*cos(phi').

             @parallax = $tel->parallax;

       geoc_lat
           Return the geocentric latitude. By default this is in radians.

           An argument of "d" or "s" can be supplied to retrieve the value in
           decimal degrees or sexagesimal string format respectively.

             $deg = $tel->geoc_lat("d");

       geoc_dist
           Return the distance from the centre of the Earth. By default this
           is in metres.

             $geoc_dist = $tel->geoc_dist;

       obsgeo
           Return the cartesian coordinates of the observatory. These are the
           form required for specifying coordinates in the FITS OBSGEO-X,
           OBSGEO-Y and OBSGEO-Z header items.

             ($x, $y, $z) = $tel->obsgeo;

           Values are returned in metres.

       limits
           Return the telescope limits.

             %limits = $tel->limits;

           The limits are returned as a hash with the following keys:

           type
               Specifies the way in which the limits are specified.
               Effectively the telescope mount. Values of "AZEL" (for altaz
               telescopes) and "HADEC" (for equatorial telescopes) are
               currently supported.

           el  Elevation limit of the telescope. Value is a hash with keys
               "max" and "min". Units are in radians. Only used if "type" is
               "AZEL".

           ha  Hour angle limit of the telescope. Value is a hash with keys
               "max" and "min". Units are in radians. Only used if "type" is
               "HADEC".

           dec Declination limit of the telescope. Value is a hash with keys
               "max" and "min". Units are in radians. Only used if "type" is
               "HADEC".

           Only some telescopes have limits defined (please send patches with
           new limits if you know them). If limits are not available for this
           telescope limits corresponding to "above the horizon" are returned.

           If limits have been explicitly associated with this object using
           the "setlimits" method then those limits will be returned.

       setlimits
           This method allows limits for this telescope object to be set
           explicitly.  The contents of the limits hash must be those
           described by the "limits" method and will be returned by the
           "limits" method). Limits set in this way will override built-in
           limits.

             $tel->setlimits( %limits );

           Limits will be cleared if the object is reconfigured (eg by setting
           the obscode).

   Class Methods
       telNames
           Obtain a sorted list of all supported telescope names.

             @names = Astro::Telescope->telNames;

           Currently only returns the PAL names, and only if Astro::PAL is
           available. If it is not available, return an empty list.

REQUIREMENTS
       The list of telescope properties is currently obtained from those
       provided by PAL ("Astro::PAL") and also from the Minor Planet Center
       (http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/iau/lists/ObsCodes.html).
