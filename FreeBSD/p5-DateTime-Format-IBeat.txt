DateTime::Format::IBeat(3)                 User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       DateTime::Format::IBeat - Format times in .beat notation

DESCRIPTION
           No Time Zones

           No Geographical Borders

           How long is a Swatch .beat? In short, we have divided up the virtual and
           real day into 1000 I<beats>. One Swatch beat is the equivalent of 1
           minute 26.4 seconds. That means that 12 noon in the old time system is
           the equivalent of @500 Swatch .beats.

           Okay, so how can a surfer in New York, or a passenger on a transatlantic
           flight know when it is @500 Swatch .beats in Central Europe for example?
           How can the New York surfer make a date for a chat with his cyber friend
           in Rome? Easy, Internet Time is the same all over the world.

           How is this possible? We are not just creating a new way of measuring
           time, we are also creating a new meridian in Biel, Switzerland, home of
           Swatch.

           Biel MeanTime (BMT) is the universal reference for Internet Time. A day
           in Internet Time begins at midnight BMT (@000 Swatch .beats) (Central
           European Wintertime). The meridian is marked for all to see on the
           facade of the Swatch International Headquarters on Jakob-Staempfli
           Street, Biel, Switzerland. So, it is the same time all over the world,
           be it night or day, the era of time zones has disappeared.

           The BMT meridian was inaugurated on 23 October 1998 in the presence of
           Nicholas Negroponte, founder and director of the Massachusetts Institute
           of Technology`s Media Laboratory.

PARSING METHODS
   parse_time
       Parses a .beat time and returns a DateTime object.  The object uses the
       current date for its date and will have UTC set as its timezone. Feel
       free to use 'set' to convert to your local time.

           my $first = DateTime::Format::IBeat->parse_time( '@765' );
           print $first->datetime; # 2003-04-01T17:21:36

           $first->set_time_zone( "Australia/Sydney" );
           print $first->datetime; # 2003-04-02T03:21:36

       Note that the leading @ is optional. Also, if using direct strings, and
       leading @s, be careful to not have it interpolate it as an array by
       accident.

   parse_date
       Parses an .beat date and returns a "DateTime" object representing that
       date.

            my $dt = DateTime::Format::IBeat->parse_date('@d01.04.03');
            print $dt->ymd('.'); # "2003.04.01"

       Note: this assumes the number of .beats elapsed in the day to be 0,
       thus it will appear to be returning the day before. If you display a
       full time with it, you will find it's at UTC rather than BMT (+0100),
       thus 11pm the day before. The important thing to remember is that it is
       an accurate conversion to the usual notation, despite appearances.

   parse_datetime
       Parses an ibeat datetime string and returns a "DateTime" object
       representing that datetime.

           my $dt = DateTime::Format::IBeat->parse_datetime(
               '@d01.04.03 @765');
           print $dt->datetime; # "2003-04-01T17:21:36"

FORMATTING METHODS
   format_time
       Given a DateTime object, returns a string representating that time in
       ibeats.

   format_date
       Given a DateTime object, returns a string representating that date.

   format_datetime
       Given a Datetime object, returns a string representating that date and
       time in .beats format.

THANKS
       The original author of this module was Iain Truskett (SPOON). Since his
       tragically early death, the module has been maintained by Earle Martin
       (EMARTIN), who would like to dedicate it to his memory.

       Iain wished to thank:

       •   Dave Rolsky (DROLSKY) for kickstarting the DateTime project.

       •   Swatch, for coming up with this mad format.

       •   Jerub, from opn, who wrote the python original, from which I retain
           no code. D'oh.

       Here is a list of people and their CPAN id, extracted from various
       places.  These people have either submitted patches or suggestions, or
       their bug reports or comments have inspired the appropriate patches.

SUPPORT
       You can log bug reports via the CPAN RT system on the web:

       This makes it much easier for me to track things and thus means your
       problem is less likely to be neglected.
