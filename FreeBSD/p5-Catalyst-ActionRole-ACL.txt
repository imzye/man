Catalyst::Action::Role::ACL(3)             User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Catalyst::Action::Role::ACL - Deprecated user role-based authorization
       action class

SYNOPSIS
        sub foo
        :Local
        :ActionClass(Role::ACL)
        :RequiresRole(admin)
        :ACLDetachTo(denied)
        {
            my ($self, $c) = @_;
            ...
        }

        sub denied :Private {
            my ($self, $c) = @_;

            $c->res->status('403');
            $c->res->body('Denied!');
        }

DESCRIPTION
       Provides a Catalyst reusable action for user role-based authorization.
       ACLs are applied via the assignment of attributes to application action
       subroutines.

       You are better using Catalyst::ActionRole::ACL to do this, as it plays
       nicely with other extensions. This package is maintained to allow
       compatibility with people using this in existing code, but will warn
       once when used.
