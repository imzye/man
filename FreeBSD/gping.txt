DESCRIPTION
       Ping, but with a graph.

OPTIONS
       --cmd  Graph the execution time for a list of commands rather than
              pinging hosts

       -n, --watch-interval=WATCH_INTERVAL
              Watch interval seconds (provide partial seconds like '0.5').
              Default for ping is 0.2, default for cmd is 0.5

       -b, --buffer=BUFFER [default: 30]
              Determines the number of seconds to display in the graph

       -4     Resolve ping targets to IPv4 address

       -6     Resolve ping targets to IPv6 address

       -i, --interface=INTERFACE
              Interface to use when pinging

       -s, --simple-graphics


       --vertical-margin=VERTICAL_MARGIN [default: 1]
              Vertical margin around the graph (top and bottom)

       --horizontal-margin=HORIZONTAL_MARGIN [default: 0]
              Horizontal margin around the graph (left and right)

       -c, --color=color
              Assign color to a graph entry.

              This option can be defined more than once as a comma separated
              string, and the order which the colors are provided will be
              matched against the hosts or commands passed to gping.

              Hexadecimal RGB color codes are accepted in the form of
              '#RRGGBB' or the following color names: 'black', 'red', 'green',
              'yellow', 'blue', 'magenta', 'cyan', 'gray', 'dark-gray',
              'light-red', 'light-green', 'light-yellow', 'light-blue',
              'light-magenta', 'light-cyan', and 'white'

       --clear
              Clear the graph from the terminal after closing the program

       --ping-args=PING_ARGS
              Extra arguments to pass to `ping`. These are platform dependent

       -h, --help
              Print help

       [HOSTS_OR_COMMANDS]
              Hosts or IPs to ping, or commands to run if --cmd is provided.
              Can use cloud shorthands like aws:eu-west-1
