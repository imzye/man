NAME
       Types::PDL - PDL types using Type::Tiny

VERSION
       version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
         use Types::PDL -types;
         use Type::Params qw[ validate ];
         use PDL;

         validate( [ pdl ], NDArray );

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides Type::Tiny compatible types for PDL.

   Types
       Types which accept parameters (see "Parameters") will list them.

       "NDArray" | "Piddle" (deprecated)

       Allows an object blessed into the class "PDL", e.g.

         validate( [pdl], NDarray );

       It accepts the following parameters:

         null
         empty
         ndims
         ndims_min
         ndims_max
         shape
         type

       "NDArray0D" | "Piddle0D" (deprecated)

       Allows an object blessed into the class "PDL" with "ndims" = 0.  It
       accepts the following parameters:

         null
         type

       "NDArray1D" | "Piddle1D" (deprecated)

       Allows an object blessed into the class "PDL" with "ndims" = 1.  It
       accepts the following parameters:

         null
         empty
         shape
         type

       "NDArray2D" | "Piddle2D" (deprecated)

       Allows an object blessed into the class "PDL" with "ndims" = 2.  It
       accepts the following parameters:

         null
         empty
         shape
         type

       "NDArray3D" | "Piddle3D" (deprecated)

       Allows an object blessed into the class "PDL" with "ndims" = 3.  It
       accepts the following parameters:

         null
         empty
         shape
         type

   Coercions
       The following coercions are provided, and may be applied via a type
       object's "plus_coercions" in Type::Tiny or "plus_fallback_coercions" in
       Type::Tiny methods, e.g.

         NDArray->plus_coercions( NDArrayFromAny );

       "NDArrayFromAny" | "PiddleFromAny" (deprecated)

       Uses "topdl" in PDL::Core to coerce the value into a PDL object.

   Parameters
       Some types take optional parameters which add additional constraints on
       the object.  For example, to indicate that only empty PDL objects are
       accepted:

         validate( [pdl], NDArray[ empty => 1 ] );

       The available parameters are:

       "empty"

       This accepts a boolean value; if true the PDL object must be empty
       (i.e. the "isempty" method returns true), if false, it must not be
       empty.

       "null"

       This accepts a boolean value; if true the PDL object must be a null PDL
       object, if false, it must not be null.

       "ndims"

       This specifies a fixed number of dimensions which the PDL object must
       have. Don't mix use this with "ndims_min" or "ndims_max".

       "ndims_min"

       The minimum number of dimensions the PDL object may have. Don't specify
       this with "ndims".

       "ndims_max"

       The maximum number of dimensions the PDL object may have. Don't specify
       this with "ndims".

       "shape"

       The shape of the PDL object.

       The value is a list of specifications for dimensions, expressed either
       as elements in a Perl array or as comma-delimited fields in a string.

       The specifications are reminiscent of regular expressions.  A
       specification is composed of an extent size followed by an optional
       quantifier indicating the number of dimensions it should match.

       Extent sizes may be

       1.  A non-zero positive integer representing the extent of the
           dimension.

       2.  The strings "X" or ":" indicating that any extent is accepted for
           that dimension

       Quantifiers may be

         *           Match 0 or more times
         +           Match 1 or more times
         ?           Match 1 or 0 times
         {n}         Match exactly n times
         {n,}        Match at least n times
         {n,m}       Match at least n but not more than m times

       Here are some example specifications and the shapes they might match
       (in the match, "X" means any extent):

         2,2     => (2,2)
         3,3,3   => (3,3,3)
         3{3}    => (3,3,3)
         3{2,3}  => (3,3),  (3,3,3)
         1,X     => (1,X)
         1,X+    => (1,X), (1,X,X),  (1,X,X,X), ...
         1,X{1,} => (1,X), (1,X,X),  (1,X,X,X), ...
         1,X?,3   => (1,X,3), (1,3)
         1,2,X*   => (1,2), (1,2,X),  (1,2,X,X), ...
         1,2,3*,5   => (1,2,5), (1,2,3,5),  (1,2,3,3,5), ...

       "type"

       The type of the PDL object. The value may be a PDL::Type object or a
       string containing the name of a type (e.g., "double"). For a complete
       list of types, run this command:

         perl -MPDL::Types=mapfld,ppdefs \
           -E 'say mapfld( $_ => 'ppsym' => 'ioname' )  for ppdefs'
