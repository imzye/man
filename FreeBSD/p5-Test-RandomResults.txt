Test::RandomResults(3)                     User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Test::RandomResults - Test non-deterministic functions

DESCRIPTION
       This module aims to provide ways of testing functions that are meant to
       return results that are random; that is, non-deterministic functions.

       Some of the tests provided here might be easily achieved with other
       testing modules. The reason why they're here is that this way users
       become aware of how to test their non-deterministic functions.

NOTICE
       This is a work in progress. Comments are welcome.

SYNOPSIS
         use Test::More plan => $Num_Tests;
         use Test::RandomResults;

         is_in( my_function, [ $list, $of, $items ], "result is inside list" );

         in_between( my_function, sub { $_[0] cmp $_[1] }, 1, 10, "result between 1 and 10");

         length_lt( my_function, $limit, "length less than $limit");

         length_le( my_function, $limit, "length less or equal to $limit");

         length_eq( my_function, $limit, "length equal to $limit");

         length_ge( my_function, $limit, "length greater of equal to $limit");

         length_gt( my_function, $limit, "length greater than $limit");

SPECIAL FEATURES
       Whenever "Test::RandomResults" is invoked, a new seed is generated and
       outputed as diagnostics. This is done so that you can use it to debug
       your code, if needed.

FUNCTIONS
   is_in
       Tests if an element belongs to an array.

         is_in( my_function, [1, 2, 3], 'either 1, 2 or 3');

   in_between
       Tests if an element is within two boundaries.

       The second parameter to this function is what it uses to do the
       comparisons.

       To compare strings:

         in_between( my_function, { $_[0] cmp $_[1] }, "aaa", "zzz",
                     'result is between "aaa" and "zzz"' );

       To compare numbers:

         in_between( my_function, { $_[0] <=> $_[1] }, 1, 10, 'result is between 1 and 10' );

       To compare something else:

         in_between( my_function, &your_function_here, $lower_boundary, $upper_boundary,
                     'result is between boundaries' );

       As you can see, the function should use $_[0] and $_[1] to do the
       comparison.  As with <=> and cmp, the function should return 1, 0 or -1
       depending on whether the first argument ($_[0]) is greater, equal to,
       or less than the second one ($_[1]).

       "in_between" swaps the lower and upper limits, if need be (this means
       that checking whether a value is between 1 and 10 is the same as
       checking between 10 and 1).

   length_lt
       Tests if length is less than a limit.

         length_lt( my_function, $limit, "length less than $limit");

   length_le
       Tests if length is less or equal to a limit.

         length_le( my_function, $limit, "length less or equal to $limit");

   length_eq
       Tests if length is equal to a limit.

         length_eq( my_function, $limit, "length equal to $limit");

   length_ge
       Tests if length is greater of equal to a limit.

         length_ge( my_function, $limit, "length greater of equal to $limit");

   length_gt
       Tests if length is greater than a limit.

         length_gt( my_function, $limit, "length greater than $limit");

TO DO
       * Check if N results of a function are evenly_distributed

       * Allow the user to choose the seed when invoking "Test::RandomResults"
