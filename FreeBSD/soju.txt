NAME
       soju - IRC bouncer

SYNOPSIS
       soju [options...]

DESCRIPTION
       soju is a user-friendly IRC bouncer. It connects to upstream IRC
       servers on behalf of the user to provide extra features.

       •   Multiple separate users sharing the same bouncer, each with their
           own upstream servers
       •   Sending the backlog (messages received while the user was
           disconnected from the bouncer), with per-client buffers

       To connect to the bouncer, use the bouncer username and password. To
       use a client which doesn't support the soju.im/bouncer-networks IRC
       extension, setup one connection per server configured in soju, and
       indicate the network name in the username: "<username>/<network>". Then
       channels can be joined and parted as if you were directly connected to
       the upstream server.

       For per-client history to work on clients which don't support the IRCv3
       chathistory extension, clients need to indicate their name. This can be
       done by adding a "@<client>" suffix to the username.

       When joining a channel, the channel will be saved and automatically
       joined on the next connection. When registering or authenticating with
       NickServ, the credentials will be saved and automatically used on the
       next connection if the server supports SASL. When parting a channel
       with the reason "detach", the channel will be detached instead of being
       left.

       If a network specified in the username doesn't exist, and the network
       name is a valid hostname, the network will be automatically added.

       When all clients are disconnected from the bouncer, the user is
       automatically marked as away by default.

       soju will reload the configuration file, the TLS certificate/key and
       the MOTD file when it receives the HUP signal. The configuration
       options listen, db and log cannot be reloaded.

       Administrators can broadcast a message to all bouncer users via /notice
       $<hostname> <text>, or via /notice $* <text> if the connection isn't
       bound to a particular network. All currently connected bouncer users
       will receive the message from the special BouncerServ service.

OPTIONS
       -h, -help
           Show help message and quit.

       -config <path>
           Path to the config file. If unset, a default config file is used.

       -debug
           Enable debug logging (this will leak sensitive information such as
           passwords). This can be overriden at run time with the service
           command server debug.

       -listen <uri>
           Listening URI (default: ":6697"). Can be specified multiple times.

CONFIG FILE
       The config file has one directive per line.

       Example:

           listen ircs://
           tls cert.pem key.pem
           hostname example.org

       The following directives are supported:

       listen <uri>
           Listening URI (default: ":6697").

           The following URIs are supported:

           •   [ircs://][host][:port] listens with TLS over TCP (default port
               if omitted: 6697)
           •   irc://localhost[:port] listens with plain-text over TCP
               (default port if omitted: 6667, host must be "localhost")
           •   irc+insecure://[host][:port] listens with plain-text over TCP
               (default port if omitted: 6667)
           •   unix://<path> listens on a Unix domain socket
           •   https://[host][:port] listens for HTTPS connections (default
               port: 443) and handles the following requests:
               •   /socket for WebSocket
               •   /uploads (and subdirectories) for file uploads
           •   http://localhost[:port] listens for plain-text HTTP connections
               (default port: 80, host must be "localhost") and handles
               requests like https:// does
           •   http+insecure://[host][:port] listens for plain-text HTTP
               connections (default port: 80) and handles requests like
               https:// does
           •   http+unix://<path> listens for plain-text HTTP connections on a
               Unix domain socket and handles requests like https:// does
           •   wss://[host][:port] listens for WebSocket connections over TLS
               (default port: 443)
           •   ws://localhost[:port] listens for plain-text WebSocket
               connections (default port: 80, host must be "localhost")
           •   ws+insecure://[host][:port] listens for plain-text WebSocket
               connections (default port: 80)
           •   ws+unix://<path> listens for plain-text WebSocket connections
               on a Unix domain socket
           •   ident://[host][:port] listens for plain-text ident connections
               (default port: 113)
           •   http+prometheus://localhost:<port> listens for plain-text HTTP
               connections and serves Prometheus metrics (host must be
               "localhost")
           •   http+pprof://localhost:<port> listens for plain-text HTTP
               connections and serves pprof runtime profiling data (host must
               be "localhost"). For more information, see:
               <https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/pprof>.
           •   unix+admin://[path] listens on a Unix domain socket for
               administrative connections, such as sojuctl (default path:
               /run/soju/admin)

           If the scheme is omitted, "ircs" is assumed. If multiple listen
           directives are specified, soju will listen on each of them.

       hostname <name>
           Server hostname (default: system hostname).

           This should be set to a fully qualified domain name.

       title <title>
           Server title. This will be sent as the ISUPPORT NETWORK value when
           clients don't select a specific network.

       tls <cert> <key>
           Enable TLS support. The certificate and the key files must be PEM-
           encoded.

       db <driver> <source>
           Set the database location for user, network and channel storage. By
           default, a sqlite3 database is opened in "./soju.db".

           Supported drivers:

           •   sqlite3 expects source to be a path to the SQLite file
           •   postgres expects source to be a space-separated list of
               key=value parameters, e.g. db postgres "host=/run/postgresql
               dbname=soju". Note that sslmode defaults to require. For more
               information on connection strings, see:
               <https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lib/pq#hdr-
               Connection_String_Parameters>.

       message-store <driver> [source]
           Set the database location for IRC messages. By default, db is used.

           Supported drivers:

           •   db stores messages in the database. A full-text search index is
               used to speed up search queries.
           •   fs stores messages on disk, in the same format as ZNC. source
               is required and is the root directory path for the database.
               This on-disk format is lossy: some IRCv3 messages (e.g. TAGMSG)
               and all message tags are discarded.
           •   memory stores messages in memory. For each channel/user, only
               the latest 4K messages are kept in memory, older messages are
               discarded. This driver is very basic and doesn't support
               features such as the chathistory extension and search.

           (log is a deprecated alias for this directive.)

       file-upload <driver> [source]
           Set the database location for uploaded files.

           File upload requires setting up an HTTP listener (see https:// and
           http+insecure:// URIs in the listen directive).

           Supported drivers:

           •   fs stores uploaded files on disk. source is required.
           •   http stores uploaded files through an external HTTP service.
               source is required and must be an HTTP URL. When receiving a
               file, soju will send an HTTP POST request to that URL, sending
               the file as is in the HTTP request body; additionally sending
               the uploader soju username in the Soju-Username header. The
               HTTP server must respond with an HTTP 201 on success, with the
               Location header being set to the URL of the uploaded file.

       http-origin <patterns...>
           List of allowed HTTP origins for WebSocket listeners. The
           parameters are interpreted as shell patterns, see glob(7).

           By default, only the request host is authorized. Use this directive
           to enable cross-origin WebSockets.

       http-ingress <url>
           External URL on which HTTPS listeners are exposed.

           By default, this is https://<hostname>.

       accept-proxy-ip <cidr...>
           Allow the specified IPs to act as a proxy. Proxys have the ability
           to overwrite the remote and local connection addresses (via the
           PROXY protocol, the Forwarded HTTP header field defined in RFC 7239
           or the X-Forwarded-* HTTP header fields). The special name
           "localhost" accepts the loopback addresses 127.0.0.0/8 and ::1/128.

           By default, all IPs are rejected.

       max-user-networks <limit>
           Maximum number of enabled networks per user. By default, there is
           no limit.

       motd <path>
           Path to the MOTD file. The bouncer MOTD is sent to clients which
           aren't bound to a specific network. By default, no MOTD is sent.

       upstream-user-ip <cidr...>
           Enable per-user IP addresses. One IPv4 range and/or one IPv6 range
           can be specified in CIDR notation. One IP address per range will be
           assigned to each user and will be used as the source address when
           connecting to an upstream network.

           This can be useful to avoid having the whole bouncer banned from an
           upstream network because of one malicious user.

       disable-inactive-user <duration>
           Disable inactive users after the specified duration.

           A user is inactive when the last downstream connection is closed.

           The duration is a positive decimal number followed by the unit "d"
           (days). For instance, "30d" disables users 30 days after they last
           disconnect from the bouncer.

       enable-user-on-auth true|false
           Enable users when they successfully authenticate.

           This can be used together with disable-inactive-user to seamlessly
           disable and re-enable users during lengthy inactivity.

           When external authentication is used (e.g. auth oauth2), bouncer
           users are automatically created after successful authentication.

       auth <driver> ...
           Set the authentication method. By default, internal authentication
           is used.

           Supported drivers:

           auth internal
               Use internal authentication.
           auth http <url>
               Use external HTTP basic authentication. An HTTP request is made
               against the URL, passing the user credentials in an
               Authorization Basic header. The credentials are considered
               valid on HTTP 200; invalid on HTTP 403; and any other error
               code means an error occured.
           auth oauth2 <url>
               Use external OAuth 2.0 authentication. The authorization server
               URL must be provided. The client ID and client secret can be
               provided as username and password in the URL. The authorization
               server must support OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata
               (RFC 8414) and OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection (RFC 7662).
           auth pam
               Use PAM authentication.

IRC SERVICE
       soju exposes an IRC service called BouncerServ to manage the bouncer.
       Commands can be sent via regular private messages (/msg BouncerServ
       <command> [args...]). Commands may be written in full or abbreviated
       form, for instance network can be abbreviated as net or just n.

       Commands are parsed according the POSIX shell rules. In particular,
       words can be quoted (via double or single quotes) and a backslash
       escapes the next character.

       help [command]
           Show a list of commands. If command is specified, show a help
           message for the command.

       network create -addr <addr> [options...]
           Connect to a new network at addr. -addr is mandatory.

           addr supports several connection types:

           •   [ircs://]<host>[:port] connects with TLS over TCP
           •   irc+insecure://<host>[:port] connects with plain-text TCP
           •   irc+unix:///<path> connects to a Unix socket

           For example, to connect to Libera Chat:

               net create -addr irc.libera.chat

           Other options are:

           -name <name>
               Short network name. This will be used instead of addr to refer
               to the network.

           -username <username>
               Connect with the specified username. By default, the nickname
               is used.

           -pass <pass>
               Connect with the specified server password.

           -realname <realname>
               Connect with the specified real name. By default, the account's
               realname is used if set, otherwise the network's nickname is
               used.

           -certfp <fingerprint>
               Instead of using certificate authorities to check the server's
               TLS certificate, check whether the server certificate matches
               the provided fingerprint. This can be used to connect to
               servers using self-signed certificates. The fingerprint format
               is SHA512. An empty string removes any previous fingerprint.

               The following command can be used to fetch the certificate
               fingerprint of an IRC server:

                   openssl s_client -connect irc.example.org:6697 -verify_quiet </dev/null | openssl x509 -fingerprint -sha512 -noout -in /dev/stdin

           -nick <nickname>
               Connect with the specified nickname. By default, the account's
               username is used.

           -auto-away true|false
               Enable or disable the auto-away feature. If the feature is
               enabled, the user will be marked as away when all clients are
               disconnected from the bouncer. By default, auto-away is
               enabled.

           -enabled true|false
               Enable or disable the network. If the network is disabled, the
               bouncer won't connect to it. By default, the network is
               enabled.

           -ignore-limit true|false
               Ignore the max networks limit for this command. Only admin
               users can ignore the limit.

           -connect-command <command>
               Send the specified quoted string as a raw IRC command right
               after connecting to the server. This can be used to identify to
               an account when the server doesn't support SASL.

               For instance, to identify with NickServ, the following command
               can be used:

                   "PRIVMSG NickServ :IDENTIFY <password>"

               The flag can be specified multiple times to send multiple IRC
               messages. To clear all commands, set it to the empty string.

       network update [name] [options...]
           Update an existing network. The options are the same as the network
           create command.

           When this command is executed, soju will disconnect and re-connect
           to the network.

           If name is not specified, the current network is updated.

       network delete [name]
           Disconnect and delete a network.

           If name is not specified, the current network is deleted.

       network quote [name] <command>
           Send a raw IRC line as-is to a network.

           If name is not specified, the command is sent to the current
           network.

       network status
           Show a list of saved networks and their current status.

       channel status [options...]
           Show a list of saved channels and their current status.

           Options:

           -network <name>
               Only show channels for the specified network. By default, only
               the channels in the current network are displayed.

       channel create <name> [options...]
           Join a new channel.

           Joining a channel should usually be done with a simple join from
           the client, but this command can be used to join another user to a
           channel when used with user run.

           Options are:

           -detached true|false
               Attach or detach this channel.

               A detached channel is joined but is hidden by the bouncer. This
               is useful to e.g. collect logs and highlights in low-interest
               or high-traffic channels.

           -relay-detached <mode>
               Set when to relay messages from detached channels to the user
               with a BouncerServ NOTICE.

               Modes are:

               message
                   Relay any message from this channel when detached.

               highlight
                   Relay only messages mentioning you when detached.

               none
                   Don't relay any messages from this channel when detached.

               default
                   Currently same as highlight. This is the default behaviour.

           -reattach-on <mode>
               Set when to automatically reattach to detached channels.

               Modes are:

               message
                   Reattach to this channel when any message is received.

               highlight
                   Reattach to this channel when any message mentioning you is
                   received.

               none
                   Never automatically reattach to this channel.

               default
                   Currently same as none. This is the default behaviour.

           -detach-after <duration>
               Automatically detach this channel after the specified duration
               has elapsed without receving any message corresponding to
               -detach-on.

               Example duration values: 1h30m, 30s, 2.5h.

               Setting this value to 0 will disable this behaviour, i.e. this
               channel will never be automatically detached. This is the
               default behaviour.

           -detach-on <mode>
               Set when to reset the auto-detach timer used by -detach-after,
               causing it to wait again for the auto-detach duration timer
               before detaching. Joining, reattaching, sending a message, or
               changing any channel option will reset the timer, in addition
               to the messages specified by the mode.

               Modes are:

               message
                   Receiving any message from this channel will reset the
                   auto-detach timer.

               highlight
                   Receiving any message mentioning you from this channel will
                   reset the auto-detach timer.

               none
                   Receiving messages from this channel will not reset the
                   auto-detach timer. Sending messages or joining the channel
                   will still reset the timer.

               default
                   Currently same as message. This is the default behaviour.

       channel update <name> [options...]
           Update the options of an existing channel. The options are the same
           as the network create command.

       channel delete <name>
           Leave and forget a channel.

       certfp generate [options...]
           Generate self-signed certificate and use it for authentication (via
           SASL EXTERNAL).

           Generates a 3072-bit RSA private key by default.

           Note, reconnection to the upstream network is required to use the
           newly generated certificate.

           Options are:

           -network <name>
               Select a network. By default, the current network is selected,
               if any.

           -key-type <type>
               Private key algorithm to use. Valid values are: rsa, ecdsa and
               ed25519. ecdsa uses the NIST P-521 curve.

           -bits <bits>
               Size of RSA key to generate. Ignored for other key types.

       certfp fingerprint [options...]
           Show SHA-1 and SHA-256 fingerprints for the certificate currently
           used with the network.

           Options are:

           -network <name>
               Select a network. By default, the current network is selected,
               if any.

       sasl status [options...]
           Show current SASL status.

           Options are:

           -network <name>
               Select a network. By default, the current network is selected,
               if any.

       sasl set-plain [options...] <username> <password>
           Set SASL PLAIN credentials.

           Note, reconnection to the upstream network is required to apply the
           new settings.

           Options are:

           -network <name>
               Select a network. By default, the current network is selected,
               if any.

       sasl reset [options...]
           Disable SASL authentication and remove stored credentials.

           Note, reconnection to the upstream network is required to apply the
           new settings.

           Options are:

           -network <name>
               Select a network. By default, the current network is selected,
               if any.

       user status [username]
           Show a list of users on this server. Only admins can query this
           information.

           If username is specified, statistics are only displayed for this
           user.

       user create -username <username> -password <password> [options...]
           Create a new soju user. Only admin users can create new accounts.
           The -username and -password flags are mandatory.

           Options are:

           -username <username>
               The bouncer username. This cannot be changed after the user has
               been created.

           -password <password>
               The bouncer password.

           -disable-password
               Disable password authentication. The user will be unable to
               login.

           -admin true|false
               Make the new user an administrator.

           -nick <nick>
               Set the user's nickname. This is used as a fallback if there is
               no nickname set for a network.

           -realname <realname>
               Set the user's realname. This is used as a fallback if there is
               no realname set for a network.

           -enabled true|false
               Enable or disable the user. If the user is disabled, the
               bouncer will not connect to any of their networks, and
               downstream connections will be immediately closed. By default,
               users are enabled.

           -max-networks <max-networks>
               Set a limit on the number of enabled networks this user can
               use. A limit of 0 means no network, and -1 means to default to
               the global max-user-networks configuration value.

       user update [username] [options...]
           Update a user. The options are the same as the user create command.

           If username is omitted, the current user is updated. Only admins
           can update other users.

           Not all flags are valid in all contexts:

           •   The -username flag is never valid, usernames are immutable.
           •   The -nick and -realname flag are only valid when updating the
               current user.
           •   The -admin, -enabled and -max_networks flags are only valid
               when updating another user.

       user delete <username> [confirmation token]
           Delete a soju user.

           Only admins can delete other users.

       user run <username> <command...>
           Execute a command as another user.

           Only admins can use this command.

       server status
           Show some bouncer statistics. Only admins can query this
           information.

       server notice <message>
           Broadcast a notice. All currently connected bouncer users will
           receive the message from the special BouncerServ service. Only
           admins can broadcast a notice.

       server debug <true|false>
           Enable/disable debug logging (this will leak sensitive
           information). This overrides any value passed to soju in -debug.
