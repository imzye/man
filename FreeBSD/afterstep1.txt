AFTERSTEP(1.0)                                                  AFTERSTEP(1.0)

NAME
       afterstep - X11 window manager

SYNOPSIS
       afterstep [-d dpy ] [-debug] [-f config_file ] [-s]

DESCRIPTION
       AfterStep is a continuation of the BowMan window manager which was
       originally put together by Bo Yang.  BowMan was based on the fvwm
       window manager, written by Robert Nation.  Fvwm was based on code from
       twm.  And so on...  It is designed to emulate some of the look and feel
       of the NEXTSTEP(tm) user interface, while adding useful, requested, and
       neat features.  The changes which comprise AfterStep's personality were
       originally part of BowMan development, but due to a desire to move past
       simple emulation and into a niche as its own valuable window manager,
       the current designers decided to change the project name and move on.
       BowMan development may continue, but we will no longer be a part of it.

       Some major changes from fvwm 1.24 include:
              1. NEXTSTEP(tm)-alike title bar, title buttons, borders and
              corners.
              2.  AfterStep's Wharf is a much worked-out version of GoodStuff.
              To avoid copyright complications it is not called a "dock."
              3. NEXTSTEP(tm) style menus. However the menus are not
              controlled by applications, they are more of pop-up service
              lists on the root window.
              4. NEXTSTEP(tm) style icons. The default icons are consistent
              with those in the NEXTSTEP(tm) interface, but they are
              configurable.

       However, the flexibility of fvwm was not traded off. The initiation
       file, ~/.steprc , recognizes most of the fvwm 1.24r commands. Virtual
       screens and the pager are still intact.  Fvwm(1.24) modules should work
       just fine. However, compatibility with fvwm-2 is not planned.

SPECIAL NOTE FOR XFREE86 USERS
       XFree86 provides a virtual screen whose operation  can  be confusing
       when used in conjunction with this virtual window manager.  With
       XFree86, windows  which  appear  on  the virtual  screen  actually  get
       drawn into video memory, so the virtual screen size is limited by
       available video memory.

       With AfterStep's virtual desktop, windows which do not appear on the
       screen do not actually get drawn  into  video  RAM.  The size of the
       virtual desktop is limited to about 32,000 by 32,000 pixels. It is
       probably impractical to use a virtual desktop more than about 5 times
       the visible screen in each direction.  Note that memory usage with  the
       virtual desktop  is  a  function of  the  number of windows which
       exist. The size of the desktop makes no difference.

       When becoming familiar with AfterStep , it is  recommended  that you
       disable XFree86's virtual screen, by setting the virtual screen size to
       the physical screen size. When familiar with AfterStep , you may want
       to re-enable XFree86's virtual screen.

COPYRIGHTS
       AfterStep is based on BowMan and shares copyrights with it.  BowMan is
       derived from Fvwm code, which is in turn derived from twm code, thus
       AfterStep shares copyrights with Bowman, Fvwm, and twm.

       THIS SOFTWARE.

ANATOMY OF A WINDOW
       AfterStep puts  a  decorative border on the top and bottom of most
       windows. This border consists of a bar on the bottom that is divided
       into three sections.  These sections are referred to as "handles".
       There is also a top bar called the title bar which is used to display
       the name of the window and two title-bar buttons.

       Unless the standard defaults files are modified, pressing mouse button
       1 on the titlebar will begin a move operation on the window. Pressing
       button 1 on the bottom handle bar will begin a resize operation.
       Pressing button 2 on either the titlebar or the bottom handle brings up
       an extensive list of window operations.

       The default configuration  has  a title-bar button on each side of the
       title-bar. The one on the left is used to iconify the window,
       regardless  of  which mouse button is used. The one on the right is
       used to close the window, regardless of which mouse button is used.
       See the section on "Mouse" for more information.  Further modifications
       to AfterStep's behavior can be made in the ~/.steprc file, using
       /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/afterstep/system.steprc as a guide.

       Shaped windows such as xeyes or oclock get a title bar that floats
       above the window and no bottom bar.  The background area of shaped
       windows is transparent.  If you are tight on memory, you can disable
       the SHAPE extensions by modifying configure.h and recompiling
       AfterStep.  This way shaped windows get a solid color background and
       you save about 60 kbytes of memory when no shaped windows are present.

THE VIRTUAL DESKTOP
       AfterStep provides multiple virtual desktops for users who wish to use
       them. The screen is a viewport onto a desktop which is larger than (or
       the same size as) the screen.  Several distinct desktops  can   be
       accessed. Concept: one desktop for each project, or one desktop  for
       each  application, when  view  applications are distinct.  Since each
       desktop can be larger than the physical screen, windows which  are
       larger  than  the  screen, or large groups of related windows, can
       easily be viewed.

       The size of the each virtual desktop must be specified  at start-up
       (default:  2  times  the  physical  size  of the screen). All virtual
       desktops must be the same  size.  The total  number  of distinct
       desktops need not be specified, but is limited to approximately 4
       billion total. All windows on the current desktop can be displayed in a
       Pager, or miniature view or the current desktop.  Windows  which are
       not on the current desktop can be listed, along with their geometries,
       in a window list, accessible as a pop-up menu.

       "Sticky" windows  are windows which transcend the virtual desktop by
       "Sticking to the screen's glass."  They  always stay  put  on  the
       screen.  This is convenient for things like clocks and xbiff's, so you
       only need to run one  such gadget, and it always stays with you.

       Window  geometries  are specified relative  to the current viewport.
       That is, xterm -geometry +0+0, will always show up in  the  upper-left
       hand corner of the visible portion of the screen. It is permissible to
       specify geometries  which place  windows on the virtual desktop, but
       off the screen.  For example, if the visible screen is 1000 by 1000
       pixels, and  the desktop size is 3x3, and the current viewport is at
       the upper left hand corner of the desktop, then  invoking xterm
       -geometry +1000+1000 will place the window just off of the lower right
       hand corner of the screen.  It  can be  found by moving the mouse to
       the lower right hand corner of the screen, and waiting for it to scroll
       into view.  There  is currently no way to cause a window to map onto a
       desktop  other than the currently active desk.  A geometry specified as
       something  like xterm -geometry -5-5 will  generally  place  the
       windows lower right hand corner 5 pixels from the lower right hand
       corner  of  the visible  portion of the screen. Not all applications
       support window geometries with negative offsets.

       Some applications, like xterm and xfontsel, allow the user to  specify
       the start-up desk on the command line. xterm -xrm "*Desk:1" will start
       an xterm on desk number 1. Other applications do not understand this
       option.

INITIALIZATION
       During  initialization, AfterStep will search for a configuration file
       which describes key and button bindings, and a few  other  things.  The
       format  of these  files will be described later. First, AfterStep will
       search for a file  named .steprc in the user's home directory.  Failing
       that, it will look for /usr/lib/X11/afterstep/system.steprc for system-
       wide defaults. If that file is not found, AfterStep will exit.

       AfterStep will  set  two  environment  variables which will be
       inherited  by  its  children.  These  are  $DISPLAY  which describes
       the  display on which AfterStep is running. $DISPLAY may be unix:0.0 or
       :0.0, which doesn't work too well  when passed  through  rsh  to
       another machine, so $HOSTDISPLAY will also be set, and will use a
       network-ready description of  the display. Unfortunately, $HOSTDISPLAY
       will use the tcp/ip transport protocol, even for a  local  connection,
       so  $DISPLAY  should  be used for local connections, as it may use
       unix-domain sockets, which are faster.

ICONS
       By default, AfterStep is compiled with XPM extensions which allow one
       to use color icons similar to those in NEXTSTEP(tm), ctwm, Microsoft
       Windows, or the Macintosh.  In order to use these options, you will
       need the XPM  package,  which should be available at:
       ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/libraries.  XPM extensions can be removed from
       AfterStep if one wants to have monochrome icons and doesn't want pixmap
       tiled titlebars, etc.

MODULES
       A  module  is  a separate program, which runs as a separate unix
       process, but transmits commands to AfterStep to execute.  These modules
       get many kinds of window information from AfterStep.  Users can  write
       their  own  modules  to  do any weird or bizarre manipulations, without
       affecting the integrity of AfterStep itself.

       Modules MUST be spawned by AfterStep, (i.e. not executed from the
       command line) so that AfterStep can set up two pipes used for
       communication between the module and AfterStep.  Modules can be spawned
       during AfterStep initialization via  the Module  option, or at any time
       during the X session by use of the Module built-in function. Modules
       can exist for the duration of  the X session, or can perform a single
       task and exit.

       If a module is still active when AfterStep is told  to  quit, AfterStep
       will close down the communication pipes, and wait to receive a SIGCHLD
       from the module, indicating that it  has detected the pipe closure, and
       has exited. If modules fail to detect the pipe closure, AfterStep will
       exit after approximately  30 seconds anyway. The number of
       simultaneously executing modules is limited by the operating system's
       maximum number of simultaneously open files, usually between 60 and
       256.

       Modules are documented in their own manual pages.

ICCCM COMPLIANCE
       AfterStep attempts  to  be  ICCCM  2.0  compliant.  As of this (1.0)
       release, colormap handling is not completely ICCCM compliant.  In
       addition, ICCCM states that it should be possible for applications to
       receive ANY keystroke,  which  is  not consistent  with the  keyboard
       shortcut approach used in AfterStep and most other window managers.
       The user can disable any AfterStep keystroke that should be passed to
       the application and not intercepted by the window manager.

M4 PREPROCESSING
       If AfterStep is compiled with the M4 option, AfterStep uses m4(1) to
       preprocess its setup files before parsing. This way you can use m4
       macros to perform operations at runtime.  This makes it very easy to
       work with different displays with different characteristics.

       For example, depending on your mood, you might want different color
       schemes.  One way of doing this is by using the -m4opt to specify your
       mood.  For a sunny mood use -m4opt -DSunny; for a dark mood use -m4opt
       -DDark.  Your .steprc file might then contain:

       ifdef(`Sunny',`
       StdForeColor            Black
       StdBackColor            LightSkyBlue
       HiForeColor             yellow
       HiBackColor             PeachPuff1
       PagerBackColor          BlanchedAlmond ')

       ifdef(`Dark',`
       StdForeColor            Black
       StdBackColor            #60a0c0
       HiForeColor             black
       HiBackColor             #c06077
       PagerBackColor          #5c54c0
       PagerForeColor          orchid
       StickyForeColor         Black
       StickyBackColor         #60c0a0 ')

       The following m4 symbols are predefined by AfterStep:

       BITS_PER_RGB            The number of significant bits in an RGB color.
                               (log base 2 of the number of distinct colors
                               that can be created.  This is often different
                               from the number of colors that can be displayed
                               at once.)

       CLASS                   Your visual class.  Will return one of
                               StaticGray, GrayScale, StaticColor,
                               PseudoColor, TrueColor, DirectColor, or, if it
                               cannot determine what you have, NonStandard.

       CLIENTHOST              The machine that is running the clients.

       COLOR                   This will be either 'Yes' or 'No'.  This is
                               just a wrapper around the CLASS definition.
                               Returns 'Yes' on *Color and 'No' on StaticGray
                               and GrayScale.

       AFTERDIR                This is set to the path where the modules were
                               configured to be installed.

       AFTER_VERSION           This is a string containing the version of
                               AfterStep.

       HEIGHT                  The height of your display in pixels.

       HOME                    The user's home directory.  Obtained from the
                               environment.

       HOSTNAME                The canonical hostname running the clients (ie.
                               a fully-qualified version of CLIENTHOST).

       OPTIONS                 This is a string of compile time options used.
                               Each option is separated from the other by a
                               space.

       PLANES                  The number of bit planes your display supports
                               in the default root window.

       RELEASE                 The release number of your X server.  For MIT
                               X11R5 this is 5.

       REVISION                The X minor protocol revision.  As seen by
                               ProtocolRevision(3).

       SERVERHOST              This variable is set to the name of the machine
                               that is running the X server.

       TWM_TYPE                Tells which twm offshoot is running.  It will
                               always be set to the string "afterstep" in this
                               program.  This is useful for protecting parts
                               of your .twmrc file that AfterStep proper won't
                               understand (like WorkSpaces) so that it is
                               still usable with other twm programs.

       USER                    The name of the user running the program.
                               Obtained from the environment.

       VENDOR                  The vendor of your X server.  For example: MIT
                               X Consortium.

       VERSION                 The X major protocol version.  As seen by
                               ProtocolVersion(3).

       WIDTH                   The width of your display in pixels.

       X_RESOLUTION            The X resolution of your display in pixels per
                               meter.

       Y_RESOLUTION            The Y resolution of your display in pixels per
                               meter.

       You may well find that if you research the m4(1) manual well and
       understand the power of m4, this will be a very useful and powerful
       tool.  But if you use any of the symbols which are predefined by m4,
       you are in severe danger!  For example, Sun's m4 predefines include, so
       if you use that name in your .steprc, you are out of luck.  The correct
       solution to this problem is to put a set of quotes around the
       troublesome word:  `include'.

       To help alleviate this problem, the following options may be useful.
       To change the quoting characters used by m4, use the options -m4-squote
       and -m4-equote.  Be sure to specify both options otherwise m4 will be
       confused.  When these are given, a changequote macro is given before
       the users steprc file is processed.

       NOTE: Some versions of m4 are broken with respect to changing quoting
       characters and included files.  When the quoting strings are longer
       than one character, the macro "include(<<file>>)", where "<<" and ">>"
       are the quoting characters, contains extra characters around the
       contents of the included file.  This will confuse AfterStep.  SunOS
       4.1.3 is known to have this problem.

       If you are using GNU m4 an additional option is available.  By
       specifying -m4-prefix when starting AfterStep, m4 is instructed to
       prefix all builtin macros with m4_.  Thus, include becomes m4_include.

       The availability of the m4 preprocessing is subject to the compilation
       define M4, which is commented out in the configure.h as distributed.

OPTIONS
       -d displayname
              Manage  the  display called, "displayname", instead of the name
              obtained from the environment variable $DISPLAY.

       -debug

              Puts X transactions in synchronous mode, which dramatically
              slows things down, but guarantees that AfterStep's internal
              error messages are correct.

       -f config_file
              Causes AfterStep to use config_file instead of ~/.steprc as the
              window manager configuration file.

       -s     Run AfterStep on only the specified screen of a multi-screen
              display.  Normally, AfterStep will attempt to start up on all
              screens of a multi-screen display.  The "specified screen" is
              the one provided in the DISPLAY environment variable, or
              provided through the -d option.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
       The configuration file, usually ~/.steprc , is used to describe mouse
       and button bindings, colors, the virtual display size, and related
       items.  This section describes the configuration options.  Lines within
       the configuration file beginning with '#' will be ignored by AfterStep.
       Lines starting with '*' are expected to contain module configuration
       commands.

       StdForeColor colorname
              Sets  the foreground  color  for  menus   and  non-selected
              window  titles to colorname.  When using a monochrome screen,
              this  option  is  ignored, and black is used.

       StdBackColor colorname
              Sets  the background  color  for  menus,  and non-selected
              windows to colorname.  When using a monochrome  screen,  this
              option  is  ignored, and white is used.

       StickyForeColor colorname
              Sets the foreground color for  non-selected  window sticky
              (Sticks-to-glass) titles to colorname.  When using a monochrome
              screen, this option is ignored, and black is used.

       StickyBackColor colorname
              Sets the background color for  non-selected  window sticky
              (Sticks-to-glass) windows to colorname.  When using a monochrome
              screen, this option is ignored, and  white is used.

       HiForeColor colorname
              Sets the color for selected window's title to colorname.  When
              using a monochrome screen, this option is ignored, and black is
              used.  Note that this currently also controls the menu
              highlights, popup menu titles and the icon title font.  This is
              a "feature."

       HiBackColor colorname
              Sets the background color for the selected window to colorname.
              When using a monochrome screen, this option is ignored, and
              white is used.  Note that this also controls the IconTitle
              background color.

       MenuForeColor colorname
              Sets the menu foreground color.  When using monochrome, this
              option is ignored.

       MenuBackColor colorname
              Sets the menu background color.  When using monochrome, this
              option is ignored.

       MenuStippleColor colorname
              Sets the color for shaded out entries in menus (for functions
              which  are  not allowed on the currently selected  window).
              When  using  monochrome,   this option  is  ignored, and a
              stipple pattern is used.

       MenusHigh
              Makes the popup menu submenus appear at the top of the parent
              menu instead of starting at the point in the parent window where
              the submenu item lies.

       PagerBackColor colorname
              Causes the pager background color to be colorname , instead of
              white. On a monochrome  screen,  this option  is  ignored.  If
              the NO_PAGER option is set when building AfterStep , this option
              is unavailable.

       PagerForeColor colorname
              Causes the pager foreground color to be colorname , instead  of
              black.  This is the color used to high- light the current
              viewport in the pager window.  On a monochrome screen, this
              option is ignored. If the NO_PAGER option is set  when  building
              AfterStep ,  this option is unavailable.

       PagerFont fontname
              Makes AfterStep use the font fontname instead of "fixed" for the
              pager labels.

       TextureTypes focusedtitle unfocusedtitle stickytitle menutitle menuitem
              Specifies the type of gradient fill to be used on each of the
              above parts of the AfterStep windows.  Currently valid values
              are:
              0 - No texture
              1 - Wharf-style gradient
              2 - Horizontal one way gradient
              3 - Horizontal cylindrical gradient
              4 - Vertical one way gradient
              5 - Vertical cylindrical gradient
              128 - User specified pixmap (See TitlePixmap, etc)
              The entry from the included sample.steprc is TextureTypes 1 1 1
              1 1.  This makes all gradients fill from the upper left to the
              lower right with your specified colors.

       TextureMaxColors title unfocusedtitle stickytitle menutitle menuitem
              The number of colors to use on textures.  Default is
              TextureMaxColors 10 10 10 10 10 on 8 bpp screens and
              TextureMaxColors 128 128 128 128 128 on 16+ bpp screens. The
              actual number of allocated colors may be lower.  You must at
              least specify a value for title.

       TitleTextureColor from to
              Colors that the gradient will go from and to when gradients are
              drawn in a window titlebar.  The default values for from and to
              are #101030 and  #303080 respectively.  Values must be in either
              standard X color names or hex notation.

       UTitleTextureColor from to
              Colors that the gradient will go from and to when gradients are
              drawn in a non-focused window titlebar.  The default values for
              from and to are #86868a and  #c0b6c3 respectively.  Values must
              be in either standard X color names or hex notation.

       STitleTextureColor from to
              Colors that the gradient will go from and to when gradients are
              drawn in a sticky window titlebar.  The default values for from
              and to are #86868a and #c0b6c3 respectively.  Values must be in
              either standard X color names or hex notation.

       MenuTextureColor from to
              Colors that the gradient will go from and to when gradients are
              drawn on the menu entries.  The default values for from and to
              are #101030 and  #404090 respectively.  Values must be in either
              standard X color names or hex notation.

       MTitleTextureColor from to
              Colors that the gradient will go from and to when gradients are
              drawn for menu titles.  The default values for from and to are
              #101030 and  #303080 respectively.  Values must be in either
              standard X color names or hex notation.

       TitlePixmap xpmname
              If the TextureType of the focused titlebar is set to 128, this
              command causes the xpm defined by xpmname to be tiled in the
              titlebar instead of a solid color or a gradient texture.  Note
              that the titlebar by default can show a pixmap of up to 19
              pixels in height, though it may be of any length.  One need not
              specify the complete path if the xpm is in the directory defined
              by PixmapPath.

       UTitlePixmap xpmname
              If the TextureType of unfocused titlebars is set to 128, this
              command causes the xpm defined by xpmname to be tiled in the
              titlebar instead of a solid color or a gradient texture.  Note
              that the titlebar by default can show a pixmap of up to 19
              pixels in height, though the xpm graphic may be of any actual
              height and length.  The full path to the xpm is not required if
              it is in the directory defined by PixmapPath.

       STitlePixmap xpmname
              If the TextureType of sticky titlebars is set to 128, this
              command causes the xpm defined by xpmname to be tiled in the
              titlebar of sticky windows instead of a solid color or a
              gradient texture.  Note that the titlebar by default can show a
              pixmap of up to 19 pixels in height, though the xpm graphic may
              be of any actual height and length.  The full path to the xpm is
              not required if it is in the directory defined by PixmapPath.

       TexturedHandle
              Turns on textures for all window handles.  The handle texture
              will be the same as the texture used in the window's titlebar.

       GradientText
              Causes a gradient to be applied to the titlebar text of the
              focused window.  The gradient colors are set using
              TextGradientColor.

       TextGradientColor from to
              Colors that the gradient will go from and to when gradients are
              drawn for the titlebar text.  The default values for from and to
              are #101030 and  #303080 respectively.  Values must be in either
              standard X color names or hex notation.

       TitleTextAlign num
              Defines the alignment of the window title in the titlebar.  The
              allowable values for num are as follows:
              1: left aligned
              2: right aligned
              3: center aligned (default)

       TitlebarNoPush
              Causes the titlebar not to appear to be "pushed in" when you
              click on it with a mouse button.  This is useful to reduce video
              strain or if you use textured pixmaps that do not look good
              "pushed in."

       TitleButton num xpmname
              Defines the pixmaps to use instead of the default NEXTSTEP(tm)
              style titlebar buttons that are the default.  Up to 8 buttons
              are possible.  num specifies the position of the button on the
              window and is an integer from 1-8.  The positions are indicated
              as below:
              1 3 5 7   TitleBarText  8 6 4 2
              Note that you must bind an action to any new buttons you add
              using the Mouse definitions.  The pixmap defined by xpmname
              should be exactly 10x10 pixels to fit inside the gray button
              bevel.

       Font fontname
              Makes AfterStep use the font fontname instead of "fixed" for
              menus, the resize indicators, and icon  labels  (if IconFont is
              not specified).

       WindowFont fontname
              Makes AfterStep use the font fontname instead of "fixed" for the
              window title bar.

       NoTitle windowname
              Keeps AfterStep from putting a titlebar in the decorations for
              windows named windowname.  This  is  handy for clocks and
              similar gadgets that you don't want to take up too much  space.
              windowname can be a window's name or its class.

              Windowname can  contain  the wildcards "*" and "?" which match
              window names in the normal  unix  filename matching  manner: "*"
              matches any number of any character and "?" matches one of any
              character.  Actual "*", "?", and "\" characters in a window name
              can be entered by  preceding the character with a "\".

       Sticky windowname
              Sticky windows "stick to the screen's glass."  That is,  they
              don't move the the viewport into the virtual desktop changes.
              windowname can be a window's name or its class.  See NoTitle for
              a discussion of the windowname parameter.

       StaysOnTop windowname
              These   windows  always  try  to stay on top of the other
              windows. This might be handy  for  clocks  or mailboxes that you
              would always like to be visible.  If the window is explicitly
              lowered,  it  will  not try  to  force  its way back to the top
              until it is explicitly raised.  windowname can  be  a window's
              name or its class. See NoTitle for a discussion of the
              windowname parameter.

       StartsOnDesk windowname desk-number
              This  command causes windows whose name or class is windowname
              to be initially placed on desktop number desk-number. windowname
              should be enclosed in double quotes.  If  the  window  requires
              interactive placement, an outline will be displayed on the
              current desk, but the window will appear on the specified desk.
              See NoTitle for a discussion of the windowname parameter.

       CirculateSkip windowname
              Causes  windows  with  the  indicated  name  to  be skipped over
              when the  CirculateUp,  CirculateDown or Warp functions  are
              invoked.  windowname can be a window's name or its class.  See
              NoTitle for a discussion of the windowname parameter.

       CirculateSkipIcons
              Causes circulate and warp operations to  skip  over iconified
              windows.

       WindowListSkip windowname
              Causes  windows  with the indicated name to be left out of the
              window list.  See NoTitle for a discussion of the windowname
              parameter.

       NoFocus windowname
              Causes  windows  with the indicated name to not take the focus
              when the pointer moves over them in focus-follows-mouse (the
              default) mode, or when the window is clicked in ClickToFocus
              mode.  See NoTitle for a discussion of the windowname parameter.

       Style windowname options
              This command is intended to  replace  the commands NoFocus,
              NoBorder, NoTitle,  StartsOnDesk, Sticky, StaysOnTop, Icon,
              WindowListSkip, CirculateSkip, SuppressIcons, BoundaryWidth,
              NoBoundaryWidth, StdForeColor, and StdBackColor with a single
              flexible and comprehensive command.  This command is used to set
              attributes of a window to values  other than the default, or to
              set the  window-manager default styles.  windowname can  be  a
              window's  name,  class   or resource  string. It  can  contain
              the wildcards "*" and/or "?", which are matched in the usual
              unix filename manner.  options is a comma separated list
              containing all or some of the keywords BorderWidth, HandleWidth,
              NoFocus, Icon/NoIcon, NoTitle/Title, NoHandles/Handles,
              WindowListSkip/WindowListHit, CirculateSkip/CirculateHit,
              StaysOnTop/StaysPut, Sticky/Slippery, StartIconic/StartNormal,
              Color, ForeColor, BackColor, StartsOnDesk/StartsAnyWhere, and
              IconTitle/NoIconTitle.

              In the above  list,  some options  are  listed  as style-
              option/opposite-style-option.  The  opposite-style-option for
              entries that have  them  describes the default behavior, and can
              be used if you want to change the default behavior.

              Icon takes an (optional) unquoted string  argument which  is the
              icon bitmap or pixmap to use.  StartsOnDesk takes a numeric
              argument which is the desktop number on which the window should
              be initially placed.  BorderWidth takes a numeric argument which
              is  the width of the border to place the window if it does not
              have resize-handles.  HandleWidth takes a numeric argument which
              is the height of the bottom bar to place with the window if it
              has resize handles.

              Color takes two arguments. The first is the window label's text
              color, and the second is the window decoration's normal
              background color.  The two colors are separated with a slash.
              If the use of a slash causes  problems, then the separate
              ForeColor and BackColor options can be used.

              An example:

              # Change default AfterStep behavior to no titlebars on windows!
              # Also, define a default icon.
              Style "*" NoTitle,Icon unknown1.xpm,BorderWidth 4,HandleWidth 5

              # now, window specific changes:
              Style "Fvwm*"      NoHandles,Sticky,WindowListSkip
              # the above line is for those that use Fvwm
              # modules with AfterStep
              Style "Pager"      StaysOnTop
              Style "*clock"     NoHandles,Sticky,StaysOnTop,WindowListSkip
              Style "xbiff"      Sticky,WindowListSkip
              Style "Wharf"      NoHandles,Sticky,WindowListSkip
              Style "sxpm"       NoHandles

              # Put title-bars back on xterms only!
              Style "xterm"      Title, Color black/grey
              Style "rxvt"       Icon term.xpm
              Style "xterm"      Icon rterm.xpm
              Style "xcalc"      Icon xcalc.xpm
              Style "xbiff"      Icon mail1.xpm
              Style "xmh"        Icon mail1.xpm, StartsOnDesk 2
              Style "xman"       Icon xman.xpm
              Style "matlab"     Icon math4.xpm, StartsOnDesk 3
              Style "xmag"       Icon magnifying_glass2.xpm
              Style "xgraph"     Icon graphs.xpm
              Style "Maker"      StartsOnDesk 1
              Style "signal"     StartsOnDesk 3

              Note that all properties for a window will be read together. In
              the above example "Pager" gets the property StaysOnTop via an
              exact window name match, but  also gets NoHandles,Sticky, and
              WindowListSkip by a match to "AfterStep*".  It  will get
              NoTitle  by virtue of a match to "*". If conflicting styles are
              specified for a window, then the last style  specified will be
              used.

              If  the NoIcon attribute is set, then the specified window will
              simply disappear when it is  iconified.  The  window  can  be
              recovered through the window list.  If Icon is set without an
              argument, then  the NoIcon  attribute is cleared, but no icon is
              specified.  An example which allows  only  the Pager module icon
              to exist:

              Style "*" NoIcon
              Style "Pager" Icon

       CenterOnCirculate
              When  circulating,  the desktop page containing the window which
              the pointer is moving to is  automatically selected.  If
              CenterOnCirculate is selected, then AfterStep will do its best
              to  center  the  target window  in  the  desktop viewport,
              rather than just lining up to the closest page.

       DeskTopSize HorizontalxVertical
              Defines the virtual desktop size in units of the physical screen
              size.

       DeskTopScale Scale
              Defines  the  virtual desktop scale with respect to the screen.

       BoundaryWidth Width
              Changes the bottom bar (handle) size (in pixels) on windows to
              the specified value.  The default size is 8.

       NoBoundaryWidth Width
              Changes the width of the bottom bar (handle) for windows with no
              titles and no resize corners.  The default is 0.  Any positive
              or zero value is acceptable.  The handles without resize corners
              have the same mouse and keyboard bindings as the handles on
              normal windows.

       XORvalue number
              Changes the value with which bits are  XOR'ed  when doing
              rubber-band  window moving or resizing. Setting this value is a
              trial-and-error process.

       EdgeScroll horizontal vertical
              Specifies the percentage of a page to  scroll  when the  cursor
              hits the edge of a page. If you don't want any paging or
              scrolling when you hit the  edge of  a  page, include EdgeScroll
              0 0 in your .steprc file. If you want whole pages, use
              EdgeScroll  100 100.  Both  horizontal and vertical should be
              positive numbers.

              If the horizontal and vertical percentages are multiplied by
              1000, then scrolling will wrap around at the edge of  the
              desktop.  If  "EdgeScroll  100000 100000"  is  used, AfterStep
              will scroll by whole pages, wrapping around at the edge of the
              desktop.

       PagingDefault pagingdefaultvalue
              Tells AfterStep if  it  should  start up  with  paging enabled
              or disabled.  "PagingDefault 0" will start AfterStep with paging
              disabled, "PagingDefault 1"  will start AfterStep with paging
              enabled by default.

       EdgeResistance scrolling moving
              Tells  how  hard it should be to change the desktop viewport by
              moving the mouse over the edge  of  the screen,  and how hard it
              should be to move a window over the edge of the screen.

              The first parameter  tells  how   milliseconds  the pointer
              must  spend on the screen edge before AfterStep will move the
              viewport. This is intended for people who  use  EdgeScroll  100
              100, but find themselves accidentally flipping pages when  they
              don't  want to.

              The second parameter tells how many pixels over the edge of the
              screen a window's edge must move before it actually moves
              partially off the screen.

              Note  that, with EdgeScroll 0 0, it is still possible to move or
              resize windows across  the edge  of the  current  screen. By
              making the first parameter to EdgeResistance 10000, this  type
              of  motion  is impossible.  With EdgeResistances less than
              10000, but greater than 0, moving over pages becomes  difficult
              but not impossible.

       OpaqueMove percentage
              Tells AfterStep the  maximum size  window  with which opaque
              window movement should be used. The percentage is  percent  of
              the total   screen area. With OpaqueMove 0, all windows will be
              moved  using  the traditional  rubber-band  outline.  With
              OpaqueMove 100, all windows will be move as solid windows. The
              default  is OpaqueMove 5 which allows small windows to be moved
              in an opaque manner, but large  windows to be moved as rubber-
              bands.  Using this option with large values can slow down your
              video response on slower systems.

       ClickToFocus [flag]
              Normally keyboard input goes to the window the mouse pointer is
              in. If this option is set, the keyboard input (aka focus) stays
              with one window until a new window is clicked on.

              If the (optional) flag is given a nonzero value, a mouse button
              click that changes the keyboard focus is caught and processed
              only by AfterStep.  If the flag is zero, or is not supplied, a
              click that changes the focus is passed through for the
              application to process.

              When the flag is nonzero, it is useful to assign a NoFocus style
              to all applications that are entirely mouse-controlled (e.g.
              Wharf).

       SloppyFocus
              This option changes the way focus-follows-mouse (the AfterStep
              default) mode behaves when the mouse pointer enters the root
              window (that is, the background area).  Normally, the keyboard
              focus would disappear at this stage, but when SloppyFocus is on,
              exiting a window to enter the root window leaves the focus
              unchanged.  The focus will not be removed from the last (non-
              root) window you visited until the mouse pointer enters a new
              window.

              SloppyFocus has no effect in ClickToFocus mode.

       ClickToRaise buttons
              In focus-follows-mouse mode, ClickToRaise specifies mouse
              buttons that raise a partially obscured window to the top.  On a
              window that is fully visible (except a normal window may still
              be below StaysOnTop windows) all the mouse buttons behave
              normally.  Please note that in most applications you can use
              mouse buttons in combination with the shift key to avoid the
              ClickToRaise behavior when needed.

              In click-to-focus mode, ClickToRaise specifies the mouse buttons
              that raise an unfocused window to the top.  The rest of the
              mouse buttons merely change the focus without raising, although
              you can have them do delayed raising with the AutoRaise command
              or the Auto module.

              In both focusing modes, ClickToRaise is not triggered on window
              decorations such as the title bar, but only on the application
              area.

              The mouse buttons are numbered as in the Button command.  You
              can specify any or all of your mouse buttons here as a space- or
              comma-separated list.

       OpaqueResize
              Causes resize operations to be done with the window itself,
              instead of an outline.  Using this option does not always work
              well on slower video systems.

       DontMoveOff
              Prevents windows from being moved off or  initially placed off
              of the desktop.  A few programs will not work correctly if you
              use this  option.  This  only keeps  windows  from  being
              completely lost off the edge of the desktop. It insists on
              keeping 16  pixels on  the  desktop, but doesn't care a bit
              about keeping the whole window on the desk.  See  EdgeResistance
              if you don't like having windows partially off the screen.

       AutoRaise delay
              This built-in was replaced by the module Auto(1).

       Pager X_Location Y_Location
              Enables a paging style of moving across  the  desktop.  A  Pager
              window  will appear at ( X_Location, Y_Location ) (not a pop-
              up). Miniature  versions  of all  the windows on the virtual
              desktop are shown in the pager.  The color of the miniature
              version  is  the same as the color of the full-size window's
              border.

              In the Pager window, pressing mouse button  1  will move  the
              desktop viewport to the selected page (in click-to-focus mode,
              it will also move the keyboard focus  to the window whose
              miniature you click on).  Pressing button 2 on a window  in the
              pager  will begin a window move, using the miniature to quickly
              move the window anywhere on the desktop.  Pressing button 3 will
              move the top-left corner of the viewport to the location of the
              button press, even  if it does not line up with a page.
              Dragging button 3 will cause the selected viewport to scroll  as
              you move   the  pointer.  The Pager   is  automatically sticky,
              but does not automatically StayOnTop.

       Mouse Button Context Modifiers Function
              Defines a mouse binding.  Button is the mouse button number.  If
              Button  is  zero, then any button will perform the specified
              function.  Context describes in what context the binding
              applies. Valid contexts are R for the root window,  W  for  an
              application window,  T  for  a window title bar, S for a window
              titlebar, or bottom bar, F for a window frame (the handle
              corners), I for an Icon window, or any combination of these
              letters.  1 is for the left title-bar button and 2 is for the
              title-bar button A  is  for any context except for title-bar
              buttons. For instance, a context of FST will  apply when  the
              mouse   is anywhere in a window's border, except the title-bar
              buttons.

              Modifiers is any combination of N for no modifiers, C for
              control,   S for shift, M for Meta, or A for any modifier.  For
              example, a modifier of CM  will apply  when  both the Meta and
              shift keys are down.  Function is one of the following:
              AfterStep's built in functions, a Pop-up menu, or a user-defined
              function.

       Key keyname Context Modifiers Function
              Binds  a  keyboard key to a specified AfterStep built in
              function. Definition is the same as  for  a  mouse binding,
              except  that  the  mouse button number is replaced with a key
              name. The keyname is one of the entries from
              /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h, with the leading XK_  omitted.
              The Context and Modifiers fields are defined as in the mouse
              binding.  Function is one of the following: AfterStep's built in
              functions, a Pop-up menu, or an exec call to a program.

              Binding  a key to a title-bar button will not cause that button
              to appear unless a mouse  binding  also exists.

       IconBox left top right bottom
              Defines  regions  of  the screen in which to place icons. Up to
              four icon boxes can be defined. If  an IconBox  line is
              provided, the icons will automatically be placed in them, if
              possible. Each  time  a window  is  iconified,  a new place is
              found for it.  Icon boxes are searched for  space  going left
              to right,  then top to bottom. Icons will not be automatically
              placed on top of  other  icons,  but  they  may  be placed
              underneath  application windows. If left or right is negative,
              then AfterStep will add  the  screen width  to it.  If  top or
              bottom is negative, then AfterStep will add the screen height to
              it. NOTE: -0  is not  parsed  as  the  right  or bottom pixel on
              the screen. You have to use -1 instead.

              If no IconBox line is provided, or all  icon  boxes are  full,
              then AfterStep will place icons near the current pointer
              location.

       StubbornIconPlacement
              When used with IconBoxes, causes  icons   to  avoid placing
              themselves underneath existing windows.

       StubbornIcons
              Changes de-iconification behavior a bit. Instead of having
              windows always de-Iconify themselves on  the current  page,  the
              de-iconify into their original position.

       SuppressIcons Prevents icon windows from being created or  drawn.  When
       used  with  the  window-list, this provides a sort of icon manager.

       StickyIcons
              Causes icons to always stick to the screen's glass.  That  is,
              icons always follow you around the desktop.  When a window is
              de-iconified,  it  gets  unstuck.  Some people find this a
              useful way of moving windows around.

       IconTitle
              Makes AfterStep add icon titles to the application's icon.  Note
              that using icon titles will leave less space for the application
              icon itself on the button, since the icontitle covers up part of
              the button.

       IconFont fontname
              Makes AfterStep use the font fontname instead  of "fixed" for
              the IconTitle fonts.

       ButtonNoBorder
              Defines that the icon buttons should not have any borders drawn
              around them.  This is particularly useful to have "flat" icon
              buttons, or if one defines a pixmap as the background for the
              buttons that already includes a border.

       ButtonTextureType num
              Defines the gradient type to use on the icon buttons.  See the
              discussion of TextureTypes for the allowable values for num.
              Use 0 for num if you want to set a solid color for the texture
              with ButtonBgColor.

       ButtonTextureColor from to
              Colors that the gradient will go from and to when gradients are
              drawn for icon buttons.  The default values for from and to are
              #101030 and #303080 respectively.   Values must be in either
              standard X color names or hex notation.

       ButtonMaxColors NumColors
              The number of colors to use on icon button textures.  The
              default is 10 on 8-bit video systems and 128 on 16+ bit video
              systems.

       ButtonBgColor Color
              If ButtonTextureType is set to 0, this command forces AfterStep
              to use Color for the button background.   The default value for
              Color is #bdbebd.  Values must be in either standard X color
              names or hex notation.

       ButtonPixmap xpmname
              Defines the xpm file to be used as the background for icon
              buttons.  This xpm will be what shows through the transparent
              pixels in the application's defined xpm icon.  Application icons
              can be defined using Icon or Style.

       IconPath path
              Specifies the full path name of a directory  where bitmap
              (monochrome) icons  can be found.  The path should start with a
              slash. Multiple directories may be  specified  in a colon
              separated list, just like the PATH environment  variable.

       PixmapPath path
              Specifies the  full path name of a directory where pixmap
              (color) icons can be found. The path  should start  with  a
              slash.  Multiple directories may be specified in a colon
              separated list, just like  the PATH environment variable.

       Icon windowname bitmap-file
              Specifies the  bitmap to be used for a window when it is
              iconified.  The windowname can be an applications window  name
              or  class  name,  and  must be enclosed in quotes. The
              bitmap-file is  either  the full  path name to a standard X11
              bitmap file, or a file in the IconPath or PixmapPath.  The
              specified bitmap/pixmap  is used  in  preference to any icon
              supplied by the window itself.

              If AfterStep is compiled  with XPM  support  for  color icons,
              then can be an XPM pixmap file.

              windowname should be enclosed in double quotes, but bitmap-file
              should not. No environmental  variables should be used in the
              bitmap-file specification.

              If windowname is an empty string, then the specified file is the
              default icon, and will be used  if no other icon bitmap or
              pixmap can be found:

              Icon "" my-favorite-icon

       DecorateTransients
              Causes  transient windows, which are normally left undecorated,
              to be given  the  usual AfterStep decorations. Note  that some
              pop-up windows, such as the xterm menus, are not managed by the
              window manager, and still do not receive decorations.

       RandomPlacement
              Causes  windows  which would normally require user placement to
              be automatically  placed  in ever-so-slightly random locations.

       SmartPlacement
              Causes  windows  which would normally require user placement to
              be automatically  placed  in a  smart location  - a location in
              which they do not overlap any other windows on the screen. If no
              such  position can be found, user-placement or random placement
              will be used as a fall-back method.  For  the best of all
              possible worlds, use both random placement and SmartPlacement.

       StubbornPlacement
              When using SmartPlacement, causes new  windows  to avoid placing
              themselves over icons.

       NoPPosition
              Instructs AfterStep to ignore the PPosition field when adding
              new windows.   Adherence  to  the  PPosition field is required
              for some applications, but if you don't have one of those, its a
              real headache.

       ClickTime
              delay Specifies the  maximum  delay  (in  milli-seconds) between
              a button press and a button release for the Function builtin to
              consider  the action  a  mouse click. The default delay is 150
              milli-seconds.

              The same delay is used to decide whether a pop-up menu brought
              up by pressing a mouse button should stay visible after the
              mouse button is released.

       ModulePath
              Specifies a  path  for AfterStep to search when looking for a
              module to load.  The path is  a  colon separated  list, just
              like the usual Unix PATH environment variable. Individual
              directories do  not  need trailing slashes.

       Module ModuleName
              Specifies a  module which should be spawned during
              initialization. The modules in the main distribution are Wharf,
              Auto, Pager, and Audio.  Fvwm 1.24 modules like FvwmPager,
              FvwmBanner, FvwmWinList, FvwmClean, FvwnIdent, FvwmSave,
              FvwmScroll, and FvwmDebug can also be used by AfterStep.  These
              modules have their own man pages.  Module can  also  be  used
              as  a builtin.  Modules can be short lived transient programs,
              or,  like  Wharf,  can be  intended  to remain  for  the
              duration of the X session.  Modules called by Module will be
              terminated by the window-manager  prior  to restarts  and quits,
              if possible. See the introductory section on modules.

       Cursor cursor_num cursor_type
              This provides a very awkward way of changing cursor styles.
              Cursor  num  tells  which  cursor  you are changing, and is a
              number between 0 and 12, as follows:

              0 POSITION      - used when initially placing windows
              1 TITLE         - used in a window title-bar
              2 DEFAULT       - used in windows that don't bother to set
                                their cursor
              3 SYS           - used in one of the title-bar buttons
              4 MOVE          - used when moving or resizing windows
              5 WAIT          - used during an EXEC builtin command
              6 MENU          - used in menus
              7 SELECT        - used for various builtin commands such as
                                iconify
              8 DESTROY       - used for DESTROY and DELETE built-ins
              9 TOP           - used in the top side-bar of a window
              10 RIGHT        - used in the right side-bar (not available)
              11 BOTTOM       - used in the bottom handle of a window
              12 LEFT         - used in the left side-bar (not available)
              13 TOP_LEFT     - used in the top left corner
              14 TOP_RIGHT    - used in the top right corner
              15 BOTTOM_LEFT  - used in the bottom left corner
              16 BOTTOM_RIGHT - used in the bottom right corner

              The cursor_type  argument  is a number which tells the cursor
              shape to use. The available numbers  can be  found in
              /usr/include/X11/cursorfont.h, and are currently even numbers
              between 0 and  152.  At  the current time, the following cursor
              types are available.

              0   X_cursor              2   arrow
              4   based_arrow_down      6   based_arrow_up
              8   boat                  10  bogosity
              12  bottom_left_corner    14  bottom_right_corner
              16  bottom_side           18  bottom_tee

       AppsBackingStore
              Causes   application  windows  to request  backing store.
              Specifying this  option  causes  the  window manager  to  fail
              to be ICCCM compliant. While this option can speed things up in
              an X-terminal,  where re-draws  of  windows is expensive, it may
              not help much on regular workstations.

       SaveUnders
              Causes the AfterStep decoration frames to request  saveunders.
              This will cause AfterStep to save those portions of windows that
              are not visible to memory (not video memory).  This can
              significantly improve the performance during opaque moves, but
              it causes a significant increase in memory usage.  This can also
              cause garbled display with some applications.

       BackingStore
              Causes AfterStep decorations to request backing store. See the
              discussion for AppsBackingStore.

       Popup PopupName
              Starts the definition of a pop-up menu  which  will later  be
              bound to a mouse button or key.  PopupName must be  enclosed in
              quotes.   Menu  entries  are included  on lines following the
              Popup keyword. The menu definition ends with the  key  word
              EndPopup.  Menu  entries are specified as shown in the following
              example.  The first word on each  line  is  the built-in
              function which will be performed, followed by the caption
              (enclosed in quotes) which will  be shown in the menu, followed
              by any additional arguments needed by the  built-in  function.
              Sub-menus can  be  specified  by using the Popup built-in, as
              long as the sub-menu was  defined earlier  in  the configuration
              file.

              Popup "Window Ops"
                     Title   "Window Ops"
                     Move    "Move"
                     Resize  "Resize"
                     Raise   "Raise"
                     Lower   "Lower"
                     Iconify "(De)Iconify"
                     Nop     " "
                     Destroy "Destroy"
                     Title   "HARDCOPY"
                     Exec    "Hardcopy"  exec xdpr &
                     Exec    "Hardcopy RV"  exec xdpr -rv &
              EndPopup

              Note  that  if  a tab character is embedded in the caption of a
              menu entry, then  the  text  following the tab will be entered
              into a second column in the menu, and the entire menu will  be
              left-adjusted.  This  is  intended  for  shortcut labeling. The
              tab character must really be a tab. If it  is expanded into
              spaces it will not work! For example

              Popup "Window Ops"
                     Title   "Window Ops    Alt-F1"

              Is  the  start of a left adjusted menu. Alt-F1 will be placed
              toward the right side of the menu.  Shortcut keys may be
              specified in the menu  definition by preceding the character
              with an ampersand.  The ampersand will not be displayed, but the
              character after it will be displayed at the right side of the
              same entry, and if the user presses the corresponding key,  then
              that item  will  be activated as if the user had clicked on it
              with the mouse.  Only alphabetic and  numeric characters may be
              used as shortcut keys.  The shift state of  the  keyboard  is
              ignored  when  testing shortcut characters. For example:-

              Popup "Window Ops"
                     Maximize "Ma&ximise" 100 100
              EndMenu

              When  this  menu is popped up, the entry will appear as
              "Maximize x", and pressing the x key will cause  the  current
              window to be maximized. Shortcut keys are not operative unless
              MENU_HOTKEYS  was  defined  when building AfterStep.  If
              WINDOWLIST_HOTKETS  was  also defined, then hot keys are
              automatically  added  to the WindowList when it is displayed.

       Function FunctionName
              Starts  the  definition of a complex function, composed of the
              AfterStep built-in  functions,  which  will later  be bound to a
              mouse button or key.  FunctionName must be enclosed in quotes.
              Function  entries are  included  on lines following the Function
              keyword.  The definition ends with the  key  word  EndFunction.
              Function  entries are specified as shown in the following
              example. The first  word on  each line  is  the  built-in
              function which will be per- formed, followed the type of  event
              which  should trigger  the  action (enclosed in quotes),
              followed by any additional arguments needed by the built-in
              function. Menus can be specified by using the Popup built-in, as
              long as the menu was defined  earlier in the configuration file.

              The  trigger actions which are recognized are Immediate, Motion,
              Click, DoubleClick and TripleClick. Immediate actions  are
              executed  as  soon as the function is activated, even if a
              window has not been  selected.  If  there are  actions  other
              than immediate ones, AfterStep will wait to see if the user is
              clicking, double-clicking, triple-clicking or dragging the
              mouse. After the decision is made AfterStep will execute  only
              the builtins from  the function definition whose trigger action
              matches the action performed by the  user.  If  the following
              example were bound to button 1 in a window title-bar, then, when
              button 1 is pressed, AfterStep would  wait  150  msec  to  see
              if  the  button is released. If the button is not released,
              AfterStep will start  a move operation. When the move operation
              is complete, a raise operation will be performed. If a button
              release  is  detected,  then AfterStep will wait another 150
              msec for a second click.  If  only  one click  is detected, then
              the window will be raised.  If two clicks are detected,  the
              window  will  be alternately  raised  and lowered. If three
              clicks are detected the window will be Shaded or un-Shaded,
              depending on the prior state of the window. The 150 msec wait
              duration can be altered using the ClickTime option.

              Function "Move-or-Raise"
                     Move         "Motion"
                     Raise        "Motion"
                     Raise        "Click"
                     RaiseLower   "DoubleClick"
                     Shade        "TripleClick"
              EndFunction

              The  clicking, double-clicking and triple-clicking concepts do
              not carry through to using keyboard shortcuts.

              Two  special  functions  exist:  InitFunction   and
              RestartFunction.  The  InitFunction  will be called when
              AfterStep is started for the first time  in  any  X session,
              and  can  be  used  to start modules, set background  patterns,
              and  begin programs.   The restart  function will  be  called
              when AfterStep is restarted. It can be used to start modules and
              set background  patterns,  but  probably  should not be used to
              start programs.

BUILT IN FUNCTIONS
       AfterStep supports a small set of built in functions which  can be
       bound to keyboard or mouse buttons.

       Nop
              Does  nothing.  This is used to insert a blank line or separator
              in a menu. If the menu item specification is Nop " ", then a
              blank line is inserted. If it looks like Nop "",  then  nothing
              is inserted.

       Title
              Does  nothing.  This is used to insert a title line in a popup
              or menu.

       Beep
              Makes the computer beep.

       Quit
              Exits AfterStep, generally causing X to exit too.

       Restart name WindowManagerName
              Causes AfterStep to re-read itself if WindowManagerName =
              afterstep, or to switch to an alternate window manager if
              WindowManagerName != afterstep.  If the  window  manager is  not
              in your default search path, then you should use the full path
              name  for WindowManagerName.

              WindowManagerName is  not  quoted,  but name is.  name is the
              name that appears in a menu, if that is where the function is
              called from.  name is required even if the function is not
              called from a menu, for ease of parsing.

              This  command  should not have a trailing ampersand or any
              command line arguments, and should not  make use  of any
              environmental variables. Of the following examples, the first
              three are sure losers,  but the fourth is OK:

              Key F1 R N Restart " " afterstep &
              Key F1 R N Restart " " $(HOME)/bin/afterstep
              Key F1 R N Restart " " twm -f .mystartupfile
              Key F1 R N Restart " " /usr/local/bin/afterstep

       Refresh
              Causes  all  windows on the screen to re-draw themselves.

       Move
              Allows the user to move a window. If  called  from somewhere in
              a window or its border, then that window will be moved.  If
              called from the root  window, then  the user will be allowed to
              select the target window

       Resize
              Allows the user to resize a window.

       Raise
              Allows the user to raise a window.

       Lower
              Allows the user to lower a window.


       RaiseLower
              Alternately raises and lowers a window.

       Shade
              Emulates the MacOS WindowShade feature.  Once activated the
              window will become a titlebar only.

       Delete
              Sends a message to a window asking that  it  remove itself,
              frequently causing the application to exit.

       Destroy
              Destroys a window. Guaranteed to  get  rid  of  the window, but
              is a fairly violent way to terminate an application.

       Close
              If the window accepts the delete window protocol, a message  is
              sent to the window asking it to grace- fully remove itself. If
              the window does not  under- stand  the  delete window protocol,
              then the window is destroyed.

       Iconify [value]
              Iconifies a window if it is not already  iconified, or  de-
              iconifies  it if it is already iconified. If the optional
              argument value is positive,  the  only iconification will be
              allowed, and de-iconification will be inhibited. It the optional
              argument is negative, only de-iconification will be allowed.

       Maximize [horizontal vertical]
              Without its optional arguments, Maximize causes the window to
              alternately  switch  from  a  full-screen size to its normal
              size.

              With  the optional arguments horizontal and vertical, which are
              expressed as percentage  of  a  full screen,  the  user  can
              control the new size of the window.  If  horizontal  > 0,  then
              the  horizontal dimension of  the  window  will be set to
              horizontal*screen_width/100. The vertical resizing is similar.
              For example, the following will switch a window to the full
              vertical size of the screen: Maximize 0 100

              The following causes windows to be stretched to the full width:
              Maximize 100 0

              This makes a window that is half the screen size in each
              direction: Maximize 50 50

              Values larger than 100 can be used with caution.

       Stick
              Makes  a window sticky if it is not already sticky, or non-
              sticky if it is already sticky.

       Scroll horizontal vertical
              Scrolls the virtual desktop's viewport by horizontal pages in
              the x-direction, and vertical pages in the y-direction. Either
              or both entries may be negative.  Both horizontal and vertical
              values are expressed in percent of pages, so Scroll  100  100
              means  to scroll  down  and left by one full page.  Scroll 50 25
              means to scroll left half a  page  and down  a  quarter  of  a
              page.  The scroll function should not be called from pop-up
              menus.  Normally, scrolling stops at the  edge of the desktop.

              If the horizontal and vertical percentages are multiplied by
              1000, then scrolling will wrap around at the  edge of  the
              desktop. If "Scroll 100000 0" is executed over and over,
              AfterStep will move to the  next desktop  page  on each
              execution,  and   will wrap around at the edge of the desktop,
              so  that  every page is hit in turn.

       TogglePage
              Temporarily disables edge scrolling.  Edge scrolling can be re-
              enabled by calling this again.

       CursorMove  horizontal vertical
              Moves the mouse pointer by horizontal pages in  the x-direction,
              and vertical pages in the y-direction.  Either or both entries
              may be negative. Both horizontal and vertical values are
              expressed in percent of pages, so CursorMove 100 100 means to
              move  down and  left by one full page. CursorMove 50 25 means to
              move left half a page and down a  quarter  of  a page.  The
              CursorMove function should not be called from pop-up menus.

       CirculateUp [name window_name]
              Causes the pointer to move to the previous  window in  the list
              of windows for which CirculateSkip has not not been specified as
              CirculateSkip.

              If the optional arguments are  supplied,  then  the focus  will
              move to the first window whose name (or icon  name  or  class)
              matches window_name.  The  optional  argument  name is required
              if window_name is supplied, and is enclosed in quotes. This
              argument is  the  name  which  appears in menus if the function
              is called from a menu, but serves no  purpose if the function is
              not called from a menu

              Here's  an  example that moves the focus to an xterm window when
              Alt-F1 is pressed:

              Key F1 A M CirculateUp "whatever" xterm

       CirculateDown [name window_name]
              Causes the pointer to move to the next  window  in the list of
              windows for which CirculateSkip has not not been specified as
              CirculateSkip.

              If the optional arguments are  supplied,  then  the focus  will
              move to the first window whose name (or icon  name  or  class)
              matches window_name.  The optional  argument  name is required
              if window_name is supplied, and is enclosed in quotes. This
              argument is  the  name  which  appears in menus if the function
              is called from a menu, but serves no  purpose if the function is
              not called from a menu

       Warp [name window_name]
              Same  as CirculateDown, but De-Iconifies any iconified windows
              as it focuses on them.

       Wait name
              This built-in is intended to be used in AfterStep functions
              only.  It  causes execution of a function to pause until a new
              window named name appears.  AfterStep remains  fully  functional
              during  a wait. This is particularly useful in the InitFunction,
              if you are trying to start windows on specific desktops:

              Function "InitFunction"
                     Exec "I"  exec xterm -geometry 80x64+0+0
                     Wait "I"  xterm
                     Desk "I"  0 2
                     Exec "I"  exec xmh -font fixed -geometry 507x750+0+0 &
                     Wait "I"  xmh
                     Desk "I"  0 0
              EndFunction

              The  above  function starts an xterm on the current desk, waits
              for it to map itself, then switches  to desk  2,  and  starts
              an xmh. After the xmh window appears, control moves to desk 0.

       Focus
              Moves the viewport or window as needed to make  the selected
              window  visible.  Sets the keyboard focus to the  selected
              window. Raises  the  window  if needed  to  make it visible.
              Warps the pointer into the selected window  in  focus-follows-
              mouse  mode.  Does  not de-iconify.  This  function is primarily
              handy  when  used  with a  module  such  as  the  FvwmWinList.

       Desk arg1 arg2
              Changes to another desktop (workspace, room).

              If  arg1  is non zero, then the next desktop number will be the
              current desktop number plus arg1. Desktop numbers, like arg1 can
              be negative.

              If  arg1  is zero, then the new desktop number will be arg2.

              The  number  of  active  desktops is   determined dynamically.
              Only desktops which contain windows or are currently being
              displayed are active.  Desktop numbers  must be between
              2147483647 and -2147483648 (is that enough?).

       WindowsDesk new_desk
              Moves the selected window to the desktop specified as new_desk.

       GotoPage x y
              Moves the desktop viewport to page (x,y). The upper left page is
              (0,0), the upper right is (N,0), where N is one less than the
              current number of horizontal pages specified in  the
              DeskTopSize  command.  The lower  left page is (0,M), and the
              lower right page is (N,M), where M is the desktop's vertical
              size as specified in the DeskTopSize command. The GotoPage
              function should not be used in a pop-up menu.

       WindowList arg1 arg2
              Generates a pop-up menu (and pops it up)  in  which the  title
              and geometry of each of the windows currently on the desk top
              are shown. The  geometry  of iconified windows  is shown in
              brackets. Selecting an item from the window list pop-up menu
              will cause that  window  to be moved onto the desktop if it is
              currently not on it, will move the desktop viewport to  the
              page containing the upper left hand corner of the window, will
              de-iconify the window if it  is iconified, and will raise the
              window.

              If arg1 is an even number, then the windows will be listed using
              the window name (the name  that  shows up  in  the title-bar).
              If it is odd, then the window's icon name is used.

              If arg1 is less than 2, then  all windows  on  all desktops
              (except those   listed  in WindowListSkip directives), will be
              show.

              If arg1 is 2 or 3, then only windows on the current desktop will
              be shown.

              If  arg1  is  4  or 5, then only windows on desktop number arg2
              will be shown.

       Exec name command
              Executes command.  command is not quoted,  but name is.  name is
              the name that appears in a menu, if that is where the function
              is called from.  name is required  even if the function is not
              called from a menu, for ease of parsing.

              The following example binds function key F1 in  the root
              window,  with no modifiers, to the exec function.  The program
              rxvt(1) will  be  started, with  an assortment of options.

              Key F1 R N Exec "rxvt" exec rxvt -fg yellow -bg blue -e
              /bin/tcsh &

       Popup
              NOTE: This built-in takes a slightly different form when used to
              bind a sub-menu into a  menu than  it does  when  binding the
              main menu to a key or mouse button. The form described here is
              for  binding  a main menu to a key or mouse button.  Used  to
              bind a previously defined pop-up menu to a key or mouse button.

              The following example binds mouse buttons 2  and  3 to  a  pop-
              up called "Window Ops", whose definition was provided as an
              example  earlier  in  this  man page.   The  menu will pop-up if
              the buttons 2 or 3 are pressed  in  the  window  frame,  side-
              bar,  or title-bar,  with  no modifiers (none of shift, control,
              or meta).

              Mouse 2   FST  N    Popup "Window Ops"
              Mouse 3   FST  N    Popup "Window Ops"

              Pop-ups can be bound to keys through the use of the key
              modifier. Pop-ups can be operated without using the mouse by
              binding to keys, and operating via the up arrow, down arrow, and
              enter keys.

              The following example defines a  sub  menu, "Quit-Verify"  and
              binds  it  into  a  main menu, called "Utilities".

              Popup "Quit-Verify"
                     Title   "Really Quit AfterStep?"
                     Quit    "Yes, Really Quit"
                     Restart "Restart AfterStep" afterstep
                     Nop     "No, Don't Quit"
              EndPopup

              Popup "Utilities"
                     Title   "Utilities"
                     Exec    "Xterm"      exec xterm &
                     Exec    "Rxvt"       exec rxvt &
                     Exec    "Top"        exec rxvt -T Top -n Top -e top &
                     Exec    "Calculator" exec xcalc &
                     Exec    "Xman"       exec xman &
                     Exec    "Xmag"       exec xmag &
                     Popup   "Exit AfterStep"     Quit-Verify
              EndPopup

              Sub-menus must be defined prior to the main menu in which  they
              are  bound.  Sub-menu  nesting can be arbitrarily deep.

       Function
              Used to bind a previously defined function to a key or mouse
              button.

              The  following  example  binds  mouse button 1 to a function
              called "Move-or-Raise",  whose  definition was  provided  as an
              example  earlier in this man page. After performing this
              binding, AfterStep will execute to move-or-raise function
              whenever button 1 is pressed in a window title-bar.

              Mouse 1    T      A       Function "Move-or-Raise"

       Module ModuleName
              Specifies a module which should be spawned. At  the current
              time,  the only included modules are Wharf and Pager.  Wharf
              will normally  be  spawned  during initialization  instead  of
              in response to a mouse binding or menu action. Modules can be
              short  lived transient programs,  or,  like  Wharf,  can be
              intended to remain for the duration of the  X  session.  Module
              will  be  terminated  by the window manager prior to restarts
              and quits, if possible.

KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS
       All window-manager operations can  be  performed from  the  keyboard,
       so mouse-less operation should not be difficult. In addition to
       scrolling  around  the  virtual desktop  by  binding  the  Scroll
       built-in to appropriate keys, Pop-ups, move, resize and most other
       built-ins  can be bound to keys. Once a built-in function is started,
       the pointer is moved by using the up, down,  left,  and  right arrows,
       and  the action is terminated by pressing return.  Holding down the
       shift key will cause the pointer movement to  go  in  larger steps, and
       holding down the control key will cause the cursor movement to go in
       smaller steps.  Standard emacs and vi cursor movement controls (^n, ^p,
       ^f, ^b, and ^j, ^k, ^h, ^l) can be  used instead of the arrow keys.

SUPPLIED CONFIGURATION
       A  sample  configuration file, sample.steprc was supplied with the
       AfterStep distribution. It is well commented and  can be used as a
       source of examples for AfterStep configuration.

USE ON MULTI-SCREEN DISPLAYS
       AfterStep does work on multi-screen displays.  If the -s command line
       argument is not given to AfterStep , it will automatically start up on
       every screen on the specified display.  After AfterStep starts, each
       screen  is  treated independently. Re-starts of AfterStep need to be
       performed separately on each screen.  The  use of  EdgeScroll  0  0  is
       strongly recommended for multi-screen displays.

       You  may need  to  quit on each screen to quit from the X session
       completely.

       Multi-screen support is only available if you compile with
       -DMULTIPLE_SCREENS
