NAME
       chklinks - A non-threaded Perl link checker

SYNOPSIS
          chklinks [options] URL1 [URL2 [UR3 ...]]

DESCRIPTION
       chklinks is a non-threaded Perl link checker.  It helps finding broken
       links on your website.

       chklinks differs from "linkchecker" in that chklinks is non- threaded.
       It does not raises many simultaneously connections for its job.  It
       won't run out of the resources and crash your system in a moment.  This
       is certainly more desirable for most webmasters and users.

       chklinks follows robots.txt rules.  If you disallow robots from your
       website and experience problems, you need to allow chklinks.  Add the
       following lines to your robots.txt file to allow chklinks:

         User-agent: chklinks
         Disallow:

       chklinks uses LWP::RobotUA(3) and support the following schemes: http,
       https, ftp, gopher and file.  You can also specify a local file.  (To
       use https, you need to install Crypt::SSLeay(3).  This is the
       requirement of LWP::RobotUA(3).)

       chklinks supports cookies.

OPTIONS
       -1,--onelevel
           Check the links on this page and stops.

       -r,--recursive
           Recursively check through this website.  This is the default.

       -b,--below
           Only check the links below this directory.  This is the default.

       -p,--parent
           Trace back to the parent directories.

       -l,--local
           Only check the links on this same host.

       -s,--span
           Check the links to other hosts (without recursion).  This is the
           default.

       -e,--exclude path
           Exclude this path.  Check for their existence but not check the
           links on them, just like they are on a foreign site.  Multiple
           "--exclude" are OK.

       -i,--include path
           Include this path.  An opposite of "--exclude" that cancels its
           effect.  The latter specified has a higher priority.

       -d,--debug
           Display debug messages.  Multiple "--debug" to debug more.

       -q,--quiet
           Disable debug messages.  An opposite that cancels the effect of
           "--debug".

       -h,--help
           Display the help message and exit.

       -v,--version
           Output version information and exit.

       URL1, URL2, URL3
           The URLs of the websites to check against.

NOTES
       chklinks does not obey "Crawl-delay:" in robots.txt yet.  This is a
       problem in WWW::RobotRules(3), but not chklinks itself.

       If you encounter warnings like this:

           Parsing of undecoded UTF-8 will give garbage when decoding
           entities at /usr/share/perl5/LWP/Protocol.pm line 114.

       This is a LWP::Protocol(3) issue when working with HTML::Parser(3)
       version >= 3.40.  See CPAN RT Bug#20274
       http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=20274 for a
       LWP::Protocol(3) patch on this.

BUGS
       chklinks does not support authentication yet.  W3C-LinkChecker have
       support on this.  As a workaround, You can use the syntax
       http://user:pass@some.where.com/some/path for Basic Authentication, but
       this does not work on Digest Authentication.  This practice is not
       encouraged.  Your password would be visable to anyone on this system
       using ps, including hidden intruders.  Also what you type in your shell
       will be saved to your shell history file.

       "mailto:" URLs should be supported by checking the validity of its
       DNS/MX record.  Bastian Kleineidam's linkchecker(1) have support on
       this.

       Local file checking has only been tested on Unix and MSWin32.  More
       platforms should be tested, especially VMS and Mac.
