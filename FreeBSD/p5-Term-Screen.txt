NAME
       Term::Screen -  A Simple all perl Term::Cap based screen positioning
       module

SYNOPSIS
          require Term::Screen;

          $scr = Term::Screen->new();
          unless ($scr) { die " Something's wrong \n"; }
          $scr->clrscr();
          $scr->at(5,3);
          $scr->puts("this is some stuff");
          $scr->at(10,10)->bold()->puts("hi!")->normal();
             # you can concatenate many calls (not getch)
          $c = $scr->getch();      # doesn't need Enter key
          ...
          if ($scr->key_pressed()) { print "ha you hit a key!"; }

DESCRIPTION
       Term::Screen is a very simple screen positioning module that should
       work wherever "Term::Cap" does. It is set up for Unix using stty's but
       these dependences are isolated by evals in the "new" constructor. Thus
       you may create a child module implementing Screen with MS-DOS, ioctl,
       or other means to get raw and unblocked input. This is not a
       replacement for Curses -- it has no memory.  This was written so that
       it could be easily changed to fit nasty systems, and to be available
       first thing.

       The input functions getch, key_pressed, echo, and noecho are
       implemented so as to work under a fairly standard Unix system. They use
       'stty' to set raw and no echo modes and turn on auto flush. All of
       these are 'eval'ed so that this class can be inherited for new
       definitions easily.

       Term::Screen was designed to be "required", then used with object
       syntax as shown above. One quirk (which the author was used to so he
       didn't care) is that for function key translation, no delay is set. So
       for many terminals to get an esc character, you have to hit another
       char after it, generally another esc.

PUBLIC INTERFACE
       Term::Screen has a very minimal set of of fixed character terminal
       position and character reading commands:

       new()
           Initialize the screen. Does not clear the screen, but does home the
           cursor.

       term(term)
           Sets or Gets the Term::Cap object used by this object.

       rows(rows)
           Returns and/or sets the number of rows on the terminal.

       cols(cols)
           Returns and/or sets the number of cols on the terminal.

       at(row,col)
           Moves cursor to (row,col) where (0,0) is upper left corner, - if
           the spot is illegal does whatever 'cm' in termcap does, since that
           is what it uses.

       resize(r,c)
           Tell screen the new number of rows & cols physically you can skip
           the r & c and get new checked vals from stty or termcap.
           Term::Screen does not handle resize signals internally, but you can
           do it by checking and updating screen size using this function.

       normal()
           Turn off any highlightling (bold, reverse)

       bold()
           The md value from termcap - turn on bold usually

       reverse()
           The mr value from termcap - turn on reverse text often. these last
           two default to whatever is available.

       curvis()
           The vs value from termcap - make cursor very visible

       curinvis()
           The vi value from termcap - make cursor invisible

       clrscr()
           Clear the screen and home cursor

       clreol()
           Clear to the end of the line - cursor doesn't move

       clreos()
           Clear to end of screen - right and down, cursor doesn't move.

       il()
           Insert blank line before line cursor is on, moving lower lines
           down.

       dl()
           Delete line cursor is on, moving lower lines up.

       ic_exists()
           Insert character option is available.

       ic()
           Insert character at current position move rest to the right.

       dc_exists()
           Delete char option exists and is available.

       dc()
           Delete character at current position moving rest to the left.

       The following are the I/O functions. They provide standard useful
       single character reading values. getch returns either a single char or
       the name of a function key when a key is pressed. The only exception is
       when you hit a character that is the start of a function key sequence.
       In this case getch keeps waiting for the next char to see if it is fn
       key.  Generally this is the escape key, and why you need to hit esc
       twice.  To get a stright char, just use the regular 'gets' perl
       function. You will need to echo it yourself if you want.

       puts(str)
           Prints $s and returns the screen object. Used to do things like
           "$scr-"at(10,0)->puts("Hi!")->at(0,0);>. You can just use print if
           you want.

       getch()
           Returns just a char in raw mode. Function keys are returned as
           their capability names, e.g. the up key would return "ku".  See the
           "get_fn_keys" function for what a lot of the names are. This will
           wait for next char if in a possible fn key string, so you would
           need to type 'esc' 'esc' most likely to get out of getch, since
           'esc' is usually the leading char for function keys. You can use
           perl's getc, to go 'underneath' getch if you want. See the table in
           Screen::get_fn_keys() for more information.

       def_key('name','input string')
           Lets you define your own function key sequence.  'name' is what
           will be returned by getch.  'input string' is what the fn key sends
           literally.  This will override any prev definitions of the input.
           A whole bunch of defaults are defined for xterms rxvt's, etc. in
           the get_fn_keys function.

       key_pressed([sec])
           Returns true if there is a character waiting.  You can pass an
           option time in seconds to wait.

       echo()
           Tells getch to echo the input to the screen. (the default.)

       noecho()
           Tells getch NOT to echo input to the screen.

       flush_input()
           Clears input buffer and removes any incoming chars.

       stuff_input(str)
           Lets you stuff chars into the input buffer to be read like
           keystrokes.  This is only the "getch" method buffer, the underlying
           getc stuff is not touched.
