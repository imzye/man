           [-o filename] [-P page] [-W page] file

DESCRIPTION
     The btxld utility binds the specified client executable together with a
     BTX loader program and the BTX kernel, and creates a composite object
     file suitable for loading during the boot process.

     The options are:

     -q      Quiet: inhibit warnings.

     -v      Verbose: display information about the files processed.

     -b file
             Specify the BTX kernel to be bound with the client.

     -E address
             Set the client entry point.

     -e address
             Set the BTX loader entry point.

     -f format
             Specify the output format, where format is one of ‘bin’, ‘aout’,
             or ‘elf’.

     -l file
             Specify the BTX loader to be bound with the client.

     -o filename
             Name the output file.  The default is “a.out”.

     -P page
             Specify the first page of the client's segment to be marked
             ‘present’, where page may be 0 or 1.

     -W page
             Specify the first page of the client's segment to be marked
             ‘writable’, where page may be 0, and should not exceed the number
             of pages occupied by the combined .text and .data segments of the
             client image.

EXIT STATUS
     The btxld utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
