NAME
       Chemistry::Domain - Class for domains in macromolecules

SYNOPSIS
         use Chemistry::Domain;
         my $domain = Chemistry::Domain->new(parent => $bigmol);

DESCRIPTION
       A domain is a substructure of a larger molecule. It is typically used
       to represent aminoacid residues within a protein, or bases within a
       nucleic acid, but you could use it for any arbitrary substructure such
       as functional groups and rings. A domain has all the properties of a
       molecule, plus a "parent". The parent is the larger molecule that
       contains the domain. In other words, the Chemistry::Domain class
       inherits from Chemistry::Mol.

METHODS
       Note: the methods that are inherited from Chemistry::Mol are not
       repeated here.

       Chemistry::Domain->new(parent => $mol, name => value, ...)
           Create a new Domain object with the specified attributes. You can
           use the same attributes as for Chemistry::Mol->new, plus the parent
           attribute, which is required.

       $domain->parent
           Returns the parent of the domain.

       $domain->add_atom($atom, ...)
           Add one or more Atom objects to the domain. Returns the last atom
           added. It also automatically adds the atoms to the atom table of
           the parent molecule.

       $domain->add_bond($bond, ...)
           Add one or more Bond objects to the domain. Returns the last bond
           added. It also automatically adds the bond to the bond table of the
           parent molecule.
