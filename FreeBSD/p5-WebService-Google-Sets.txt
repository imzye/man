NAME
       WebService::Google::Sets - Perl access to Google Labs Sets site

SYNOPSIS
         use WebService::Google::Sets;

         my @os_list = qw(Linux Windows Solaris);
         my $expanded_os_list = get_gset(@os_list);

         # check something came back
         die "No results returned from server" unless $expanded_os_list;

         foreach my $element (@$expanded_os_list) {
           print $element, "\n";
         }

DESCRIPTION
       WebService::Google::Sets provides function based access to the Sets
       service hosted at Google Labs.

       The Sets service attempts to expand the values you provide. The example
       provided in the SYNOPSIS would return an array that included "Windows
       NT", "HPUX" and "AIX" as values in addition to those supplied.

FUNCTIONS
       By default this module exports get_gset.

       get_gset
           A utility alias for get_small_gset.

           Exported by default.

       get_small_gset
           This function takes an array of terms to expand and attempts to
           expand them using the Google Sets website.

           It returns undef on failure to connect to the remote server and an
           array reference pointing to the expanded list on success.

       get_large_gset
           This function takes an array of terms to expand and attempts to
           expand them using the Google Sets website. It returns a larger list
           than get_small_gset or get_gset.

           This function must be explictly imported.

             use WebService::Google::Sets qw(get_large_gset);

           It returns undef on failure to connect to the remote server and an
           array reference pointing to the expanded list on success.

COMMAND LINE PROGRAM
       A very simple script called get_gset is supplied in the distribution's
       bin folder. It accepts between one and five values and then attempts to
       expand them.
