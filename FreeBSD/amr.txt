AMR(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 AMR(4)

NAME
     amr – MegaRAID SCSI/ATA/SATA RAID driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device pci
           device scbus
           device amr

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           amr_load="YES"

DEPRECATION NOTICE
     The amr driver is not present in FreeBSD 14.0.

DESCRIPTION
     The amr driver provides support for LSI Logic MegaRAID SCSI, ATA and SATA
     RAID controllers and legacy American Megatrends MegaRAID SCSI RAID
     controllers, including models relabeled and sold by Dell and Hewlett-
     Packard.

DIAGNOSTICS
   Driver initialisation/shutdown phase
     amr%d: memory window not available
     amr%d: I/O window not available

     The PCI BIOS did not allocate resources necessary for the correct
     operation of the controller.  The driver cannot attach to this
     controller.

     amr%d: busmaster bit not set, enabling

     The PCI BIOS did not enable busmaster DMA, which is required for the
     correct operation of the controller.  The driver has enabled this bit and
     initialisation will proceed.

     amr%d: can't allocate register window
     amr%d: can't allocate interrupt
     amr%d: can't set up interrupt
     amr%d: can't allocate parent DMA tag
     amr%d: can't allocate buffer DMA tag
     amr%d: can't allocate scatter/gather DMA tag
     amr%d: can't allocate s/g table
     amr%d: can't allocate mailbox tag
     amr%d: can't allocate mailbox memory

     A resource allocation error occurred while initialising the driver;
     initialisation has failed and the driver will not attach to this
     controller.

     amr%d: can't obtain configuration data from controller
     amr%d: can't obtain product data from controller

     The driver was unable to obtain vital configuration data from the
     controller.  Initialisation has failed and the driver will not attach to
     this controller.

     amr%d: can't establish configuration hook
     amr%d: can't scan controller for drives

     The scan for logical drives managed by the controller failed.  No drives
     will be attached.

     amr%d: device_add_child failed
     amr%d: bus_generic_attach returned %d

     Creation of the logical drive instances failed; attachment of one or more
     logical drives may have been aborted.

     amr%d: flushing cache...

     The controller cache is being flushed prior to shutdown or detach.

   Operational diagnostics
     amr%d: I/O beyond end of unit (%u,%d > %u)

     A partitioning error or disk corruption has caused an I/O request beyond
     the end of the logical drive.  This may also occur if FlexRAID Virtual
     Sizing is enabled and an I/O operation is attempted on a portion of the
     virtual drive beyond the actual capacity available.

     amr%d: polled command timeout

     An initialisation command timed out.  The initialisation process may fail
     as a result.

     amr%d: bad slot %d completed

     The controller reported completion of a command that the driver did not
     issue.  This may result in data corruption, and suggests a hardware or
     firmware problem with the system or controller.

     amr%d: I/O error - %x

     An I/O error has occurred.
