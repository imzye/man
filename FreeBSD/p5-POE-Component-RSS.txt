POE::Component::RSS(3)                     User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       POE::Component::RSS - Event based RSS parsing

SYNOPSIS
         use POE qw(Component::RSS);

         POE::Component::RSS->spawn();

         $kernel->post(
           'rss',
           'parse' => {
             Item => 'item_state',
           },
           $rss_string
         );

DESCRIPTION
       POE::Component::RSS is an event based RSS parsing module. It wraps
       XML::RSS and provides a POE based framework for accessing the
       information provided.

INTERFACE
   spawn
       RSS parser components are not normal objects, but are instead 'spawned'
       as separate sessions. This is done with PoCo::RSS's 'spawn' method,
       which takes one named parameter:

       "Alias => $alias_name"
           'Alias' sets the name by which the session is known. If no alias is
           given, the component defaults to 'rss'. It's possible to spawn
           several RSS components with different names.

   Postbacks
       Sessions communicate asynchronously with PoCo::RSS - they post requests
       to it, and it posts results back.

       Parse requests are posted to the component's "parse" state, and include
       a hash of states to return results to, and a RSS string to parse,
       followed by an optional identity parameter. For example:

         $kernel->post(
           'rss',
           'parse' => { # hash of result states
             Item      => 'item_state',
             Channel   => 'channel_state',
             Image     => 'image_state',
             Textinput => 'textinput_state',
             Start     => 'start_state',
             Stop      => 'stop_state',
           },
           $rss_string, $rss_identity_tag);

       Currently supported result events are:

       "Item => 'item_state'"
           A state to call every time an item is found within the RSS file.
           Called with a reference to a hash which contains all attributes of
           that item.

       "Channel => 'channel_state'"
           A state to call every time a channel definition is found within the
           RSS file. Called with a reference to a hash which contains all
           attributes of that channel.

       "Image => 'image_state'"
           A state to call every time an image definition is found within the
           RSS file. Called with a reference to a hash which contains all
           attributes of that image.

       "Textinput => 'textinput_state'"
           A state to call every time a textinput definition is found within
           the RSS file. Called with a reference to a hash which contains all
           attributes of that textinput.

       "Start => 'start_state'"
           A state to call at the start of parsing.

       "Stop => 'stop_state'"
           A state to call at the end of parsing.

       If an identity parameter was supplied with the parse event, the first
       parameter of all result events is that identity string. This allows
       easy identification of which parse a result is for.

BUGS
       •   Some events may be emitted even if no data was found. Calling code
           should check return data to verify content.

       •   This really needs to be rewritten using "POE::Filter::XML".  Of
           course, I've been saying that for a few years now...
