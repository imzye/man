NAME
       Test::Mini - Lightweight xUnit Testing for Perl

DESCRIPTION
       Test::Mini is a light, spry testing framework built to bring the
       familiarity of an xUnit testing framework to Perl as a first-class
       citizen.  Based initially on Ryan Davis' minitest, it provides a not
       only a simple way to write and run tests, but the necessary
       infrastructure for more expressive test fromeworks to be written.

       Since example code speaks louder than words:

         package t::Test
         use base 'Test::Mini::TestCase';
         use strict;
         use warnings;

         # This will run before each test
         sub setup { ... }

         # This will run after each test
         sub teardown { ... }

         sub test_something {
             my $self = shift;
             $self->assert(1); # Assertions come from Test::Mini::Assertions
         }

         # Assertions can also be imported...
         use Test::Mini::Assertions;

         sub helper { return 1 }

         sub test_something_else {
             assert(helper());
         }

       Like any traditional xUnit framework, any method whose name begins with
       'test' will be automatically run.  If you've declared 'setup' or
       'teardown' methods, they will be run before or after each test.
