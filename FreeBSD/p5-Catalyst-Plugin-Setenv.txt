Catalyst::Plugin::Setenv(3)                User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Catalyst::Plugin::Setenv - Allows you to set up the environment from
       Catalyst's config file.

VERSION
       Version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
       In your application:

           use Catalyst qw/Setenv/;

       In your config file:

           environment:
             FOO: bar
             BAR: baz

       When your app starts, $ENV{FOO} will be "bar", and $ENV{BAR} will be
       "baz".

       You can also append and prepend to existing environment variables.  For
       example, if $PATH is "/bin:/usr/bin", you can append "/myapp/bin" by
       writing:

          environment:
            PATH: "::/myapp/bin"

       After that, $PATH will be set to "/bin:/usr/bin:/myapp/bin".  You can
       prepend, too:

          environment:
            PATH: "/myapp/bin::"

       which yields "/myapp/bin:/bin:/usr/bin".

       If you want a literal colon at the beginning or end of the environment
       variable, escape it with a "\", like "\:foo" or "foo\:".  Note that
       slashes aren't meaningful elsewhere, they're inserted verbatim into the
       relevant environment variable.

EXPORT
       A list of functions that can be exported.  You can delete this section
       if you don't export anything, such as for a purely object-oriented
       module.

FUNCTIONS
   setup
       Calls the other setup methods, and then sets the environment variables.

BUGS
   Escaping
       Things like "\:foo" can't be literally inserted into an environment
       variable, due to my simplistic escaping scheme.  Patches to fix this
       (but not interpert "\"s anywhere else) are welcome.
