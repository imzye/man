NAME
       io.elementary.code - text editor that works for you

SYNOPSIS
       io.elementary.code [OPTION...] [FILE...]

DESCRIPTION
       Code is the text editor that works for you. It auto-saves your files,
       meaning they're always up-to-date. Plus it remembers your tabs so you
       never lose your spot, even in between sessions.

       Make it yours. Code is written from the ground up to be extensible.
       Keep things super lightweight and simple, or install extensions to turn
       Code into a full-blown IDE; it's your choice. And with a handful of
       useful preferences, you can tweak the behavior and interface to your
       liking.

       It's elementary. Code is made to be the perfect text editor for
       elementary OS, meaning it closely follows the high standards of design,
       speed, and consistency. It's sexy, but not distracting.

       Works with your language. Whether you're crafting code in Vala,
       scripting with PHP, or marking things up in HTML, Code has you covered.
       Experience full syntax highlighting with nearly all programming,
       scripting, and markup languages.
