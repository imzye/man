NAME
       chibi-doc - generate docs from Scheme scribble syntax


SYNOPSIS
       chibi-doc [-hst] [ file ]

       chibi-doc dotted-name.of.module [ identifier ]


DESCRIPTION
       chibi-doc is a tool to generate documentation from the Scheme scribble
       syntax from Racket.  It works like a Unix filter, translating from the
       current input or a file to standard output.  You can also specify a
       module name, with components separated with dots, and it will search
       for the module and generate documentation from it automatically from
       literate comments in the module or any of its source files.  These
       comments are any line beginning with the characters ;;>

       The scribble syntax is described in the manual.


OPTIONS
       -h   Outputs in HTML format (the default).

       -s   Outputs in SXML format.

       -t   Outputs in text format (the default for describing a single
            variable).
