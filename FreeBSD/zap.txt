NAME
     zap – maintain and replicate ZFS snapshots

SYNOPSIS
     zap snap|snapshot [-DLSv] TTL [[-r] dataset]...
     zap rep|replicate [-CDFLSv] [-h host] [[[user@]host:]parent_dataset [-r]
         dataset [[-r] dataset]...]
     zap destroy [-Dlsv] [host[,host]...]
     zap -v|-version|--version

DESCRIPTION
     zap automates the management of zfs snapshots.  With a few simple crontab
     entries, it can be used to create a comprehensive zfs backup system.
     There are no configuration files.  All parameters are supplied on the
     command line or in zfs properties and all snapshot information is stored
     in snapshot names.

     zap will not interfere with manually created snapshots or snapshots from
     other tools.  It will only operate on snapshots it creates.

     If the pool is in a DEGRADED state, then snapshots will still be created,
     replicated, and destroyed unless -D is used.  If the pool is being
     resilvered or scrubbed, then snapshots will still created and replicated,
     but not destroyed.  Use -L, -l, -S, and -s to change this behaviour.

SUBCOMMANDS
   snap|snapshot
     Use the snap subcommand to create snapshots that will expire after TTL
     (time to live) has elapsed.  An expired snapshot will be destroyed the
     next time zap destroy is run.  TTL takes the form [0-9]{1,4}[dwmy].  That
     is, one to four digits followed by a character to represent the time unit
     (day, week, month, or year). If datasets are not not supplied on the
     command line, snapshots will be created for datasets with the property
     zap:snap set to on.

   rep|replicate
     Use the rep subcommand to replicate datasets.  If a destination and
     datasets are not supplied on the command line, datasets with a
     destination set in the zap:rep user property are replicated.  If the
     destination does not contain a host, or if the supplied host is
     localhost, 127.x.x.x, or ::1, then any user@ is ignored and ssh is not
     used.  If the canmount property of the local dataset is set to on, after
     replication an attempt is made to set canmount to noauto on the remote
     side.  This is done to prevent mountpoint collisions. By default,
     snapshots originating from the local host (as returned by hostname -s)
     are replicated, but -h host can be used to replicate snapshots
     originating from host.  Set the ZAP_FILTER environment variable to a
     command to filter the transfer.  For example, ZAP_FILTER="mbuffer -s 128k
     -m 10M" will filter the transfer through mbuffer.  Note that the filter
     command must be available on both the sending and receiving hosts.

   destroy
     Use the destroy subcommand to destroy expired snapshots.  By default,
     only snapshots originating from the local host are destroyed.  If a comma
     separated list of hosts are specified, then only destroy snapshots
     originating from those hosts. Hosts are specified without any domain
     information, that is, as returned by hostname -s.

OPTIONS
     -C        Do not supply -c to zfs send.  This option is unsupported on
               some systems, such as Debian 9 and NetBSD 9.

     -D        Do not operate on snapshots when the pool is in a DEGRADED
               state.

     -F        Supply -F to zfs receive, which destroys remote changes that do
               not exist on the sending side.

     -h host   Replicate snapshots originating from host instead of those
               originating from the local host (as returned by hostname -s).

     -L        Do not operate on snapshots if the pool has a resilver in
               progress.  This is the default for the destroy subcommand.

     -l        Operate on snapshots, even if the pool has a resilver in
               progress.  This is the default for the snap and rep
               subcommands.

     -S        Do not operate on snapshots if the pool is being scrubbed.
               This is the default for the destroy subcommand.

     -s        Operate on snapshots, even if the pool is being scrubbed.  This
               is the default for the snap and rep subcommands.

     -r        Recursively create or replicate snapshots of all descendants.

     -v        Be verbose.

ENVIRONMENT
     The following environment variable affects the execution of zap:

     ZAP_FILTER      Filter rep through the command contained in the variable.
                     For example, a value of "mbuffer -s 128k -m 10M" will
                     filter the transfer through mbuffer.  Note that the
                     filter command must be available on both the sending and
                     receiving hosts.

EXAMPLES
     Create snapshots that will expire after three weeks.

           zfs set zap:snap=on zroot/usr/home/nox zroot/var/
           zfs set zap:snap=off zroot/var/crash zroot/var/tmp zroot/var/mail
           zap snap 3w

     Create snapshots specifying the datasets on the command line.

           zap snap 3w zroot/usr/home/nox -r zroot/var

     Recursively create snapshots that will expire after one day.  Be verbose.

           zfs set zap:snap=on zroot/usr/home
           zap snap -v 1d

     Replicate datasets to the remote host bravo, under the zback/phe dataset.
     If you use a non-default ssh port, specify it in ~/.ssh/config.

           zfs set zap:rep='zap@bravo:zback/phe' zroot/ROOT zroot/usr/home/jrm
           zap rep -v

     Replicate datasets (recursively for zroot/ROOT) to the remote host bravo,
     under the rback/phe dataset, but this time specify the datasets on the
     command line. If you use a non-default ssh port, specify it in
     ~/.ssh/config.

           zap rep zap@bravo:rback/phe -r zroot/ROOT zroot/usr/home/jrm

     Replicate datasets originating from awarnach to the remote host bravo,
     under the zback/phe dataset. If you use a non-default ssh port, specify
     it in ~/.ssh/config.  Filter the transfer through mbuffer by setting the
     ZAP_FILTER environment variable.  Note that mbuffer must be available on
     both the sending and receiving hosts.

           zfs set zap:rep='zap@bravo:zback/phe' zroot/ROOT zroot/usr/home/jrm
           zap rep -v -h awarnach

     Destroy expired snapshots.  Be verbose.

           zap destroy -v

     Destroy expired snapshots that originated on either the host awarnach or
     the host gly. Be verbose.

           zap destroy -v awarnach,gly

     Example crontab entries for rolling snapshots and remote replication.
     Taking snapshots is normally cheap, so do it often. Destroying snapshots
     can thrash disks, so only do it every 24 hours.
