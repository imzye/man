NAME
       Plack::Middleware::Reproxy - Handle X-Reproxy-URL From Within Plack

SYNOPSIS
           # Use Furl
           builder {
               enable 'Reproxy::Furl';
               $app;
           }

           # or if you want your custom reproxy
           builder {
               enable 'Reproxy::Callback', cb => sub {
                   my ($middleware, $res, $env, $uri) = @_;
                   ....
               };
               $app;
           }

DESCRIPTION
       Plack::Middleware::Reproxy implements a simple reproxy mechanism via
       X-Reproxy-URL, like https://github.com/kazuho/mod_reproxy.

DISCLAIMER
       This module was developed for TESTING, and so has not been extensively
       used in real environments. If you need real reproxying, you should
       probably use that of lighttpd, nginx, apache+mod_reproxy, etc.
