PHONES(5)                 FreeBSD File Formats Manual                PHONES(5)

NAME
     phones – remote host phone number data base

DESCRIPTION
     The file /etc/phones contains the system-wide private phone numbers for
     the tip(1) program.  This file is normally unreadable, and so may contain
     privileged information.  The format of the file is a series of lines of
     the form: <system-name>[ \t]*<phone-number>.  The system name is one of
     those defined in the remote(5) file and the phone number is constructed
     from any sequence of characters terminated only by ``,'' or the end of
     the line.  The ``='' and ``*'' characters are indicators to the auto call
     units to pause and wait for a second dial tone (when going through an
     exchange).  The ``='' is required by the DF02-AC and the ``*'' is
     required by the BIZCOMP 1030.

     Only one phone number per line is permitted.  However, if more than one
     line in the file contains the same system name tip(1) will attempt to
     dial each one in turn, until it establishes a connection.
