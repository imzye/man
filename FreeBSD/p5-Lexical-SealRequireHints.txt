NAME
       Lexical::SealRequireHints - prevent leakage of lexical hints

SYNOPSIS
           use Lexical::SealRequireHints;

DESCRIPTION
       This module works around two historical bugs in Perl's handling of the
       "%^H" (lexical hints) variable.  One bug causes lexical state in one
       file to leak into another that is "require"d/"use"d/"do"ed from it.
       This bug, [perl #68590], was present from Perl 5.6 up to Perl 5.10,
       fixed in Perl 5.11.0.  The second bug causes lexical state (normally a
       blank "%^H" once the first bug is fixed) to leak outwards from
       "utf8.pm", if it is automatically loaded during Unicode regular
       expression matching, into whatever source is compiling at the time of
       the regexp match.  This bug, [perl #73174], was present from Perl 5.8.7
       up to Perl 5.11.5, fixed in Perl 5.12.0.

       Both of these bugs seriously damage the usability of any module relying
       on "%^H" for lexical scoping, on the affected Perl versions.  It is in
       practice essential to work around these bugs when using such modules.
       On versions of Perl that require such a workaround, this module
       globally changes the behaviour of "require", including "use" and the
       implicit "require" performed in Unicode regular expression matching,
       and of "do", so that they no longer exhibit these bugs.

       The workaround supplied by this module takes effect the first time its
       "import" method is called.  Typically this will be done by means of a
       "use" statement.  This should be done as early as possible, because it
       only affects "require"/"use"/"do" statements that are compiled after
       the workaround goes into effect.  For "use" statements, and "require"
       and "do" statements that are executed immediately and only once, it
       suffices to invoke the workaround when loading the first module that
       will set up vulnerable lexical state.  Delayed-action "require" and
       "do" statements, however, are more troublesome, and can require the
       workaround to be loaded much earlier.  Ultimately, an affected Perl
       program may need to load the workaround as very nearly its first
       action.  Invoking this module multiple times, from multiple modules, is
       not a problem: the workaround is only applied once, and applies to
       everything subsequently compiled.

       This module is implemented in XS, with a pure Perl backup version for
       systems that can't handle XS modules.  The XS version has a better
       chance of playing nicely with other modules that modify "require" or
       "do" handling.  The pure Perl version can't work at all on some Perl
       versions; users of those versions must use the XS.  On all Perl
       versions suffering the underlying hint leakage bug, pure Perl hooking
       of "require" breaks the use of "require" without an explicit parameter
       (implicitly using $_).

PERL VERSION DIFFERENCES
       The history of the "%^H" bugs is complex.  Here is a chronological
       statement of the relevant changes.

       Perl 5.6.0
           "%^H" introduced.  It exists only as a hash at compile time.  It is
           not localised by "require"/"do", so lexical hints leak into every
           module loaded, which is bug [perl #68590].

           The "CORE::GLOBAL" mechanism doesn't work cleanly for "require",
           because overriding "require" loses the necessary special parsing of
           bareword arguments to it.  As a result, pure Perl code can't
           properly globally affect the behaviour of "require".  Pure Perl
           code can localise "%^H" itself for any particular "require"
           invocation, but a global fix is only possible through XS.

       Perl 5.7.2
           The "CORE::GLOBAL" mechanism now works cleanly for "require", so
           pure Perl code can globally affect the behaviour of "require" to
           achieve a global fix for the bug.

       Perl 5.8.7
           When "utf8.pm" is automatically loaded during Unicode regular
           expression matching, "%^H" now leaks outward from it into whatever
           source is compiling at the time of the regexp match, which is bug
           [perl #73174].  It often goes unnoticed, because [perl #68590]
           makes "%^H" leak into "utf8.pm" which then doesn't modify it, so
           what leaks out tends to be identical to what leaked in.  If [perl
           #68590] is worked around, however, "%^H" tends to be (correctly)
           blank inside "utf8.pm", and this bug therefore blanks it for the
           outer module.

       Perl 5.9.4
           "%^H" now exists in two forms.  In addition to the relatively
           ordinary hash that is modified during compilation, the value that
           it had at each point in compilation is recorded in the compiled op
           tree, for later examination at runtime.  It is in a special
           representation-sharing format, and writes to "%^H" are meant to be
           performed on both forms.  "require"/"do" does not localise the
           runtime form of "%^H" (and still doesn't localise the compile-time
           form).

           A couple of special "%^H" entries are erroneously written only to
           the runtime form.

           Pure Perl code, although it can localise the compile-time "%^H" by
           normal means, can't adequately localise the runtime "%^H", except
           by using a string eval stack frame.  This makes a satisfactory
           global fix for the leakage bug impossible in pure Perl.

       Perl 5.10.1
           "require"/"do" now properly localise the runtime form of "%^H", but
           still not the compile-time form.

           A global fix is once again possible in pure Perl, because the fix
           only needs to localise the compile-time form.

       Perl 5.11.0
           "require"/"do" now properly localise both forms of "%^H", fixing
           [perl #68590].  This makes [perl #73174] apparent without any
           workaround for [perl #68590].

           The special "%^H" entries are now correctly written to both forms
           of the hash.

       Perl 5.12.0
           The automatic loading of "utf8.pm" during Unicode regular
           expression matching now properly restores "%^H", fixing [perl
           #73174].

BUGS
       The operation of this module depends on influencing the compilation of
       "require" and "do".  As a result, it cannot prevent lexical state
       leakage through a "require"/"do" statement that was compiled before
       this module was invoked.  Where problems occur, this module must be
       invoked earlier.

       On all Perl versions that need a fix for the lexical hint leakage bug,
       the pure Perl implementation of this module unavoidably breaks the use
       of "require" without an explicit parameter (implicitly using $_).  This
       is due to another bug in the Perl core, fixed in Perl 5.15.5, and is
       inherent to the mechanism by which pure Perl code can hook "require".
       The use of implicit $_ with "require" is rare, so although this state
       of affairs is faulty it will actually work for most programs.  Perl
       versions 5.12.0 and greater, despite having the "require" hooking bug,
       don't actually exhibit a problem with the pure Perl version of this
       module, because with the lexical hint leakage bug fixed there is no
       need for this module to hook "require".

       There is a bug on Perl versions 5.15.5 to 5.15.7 affecting "do" which,
       among other effects, causes "%^H" to leak into "do"ed files.  It is not
       the same bug that affected Perl 5.6 to 5.11.  This module currently
       does not work around this bug at all, but its test suite does detect
       it.  As a result, this module fails its test suite on those Perl
       versions.  This could change in future versions of this module.
