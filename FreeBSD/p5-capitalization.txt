NAME
       capitalization - no capitalization on method names

SYNOPSIS
         use XML::DOM;
         no capitalization 'XML::DOM';

         my $parser = XML::DOM::Parser->new;

         # no capitalization ..
         my $nodes = $parser->get_elements_by_tag_name("Foo");

         # this can be OK
         my $nodes = $parser->getElementsByTagName("Foo");

DESCRIPTION
       capitalization.pm allows you to use familiar style on method naming.

RULES
       Lower case character followed by upper case sequence would be splitted
       with "_" and upper case sequence would be lower cased. Example:
       "fooBar" would be "foo_bar".
       All other upper case characters would be lower cased. Examples: "FOOs"
       would be "foos", "_Foo" would be "_foo".

CAVEATS
   "no capitalization __PACKAGE__;"
       If you want use capitalization pragma in module and add lower case API
       in the module itself, then you should use pragma after all subs are
       defined.
