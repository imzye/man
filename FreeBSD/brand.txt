BRAND.4TH(8)            FreeBSD System Manager's Manual           BRAND.4TH(8)

NAME
     brand.4th – FreeBSD ASCII art boot module

DESCRIPTION
     The file that goes by the name of brand.4th is a set of commands designed
     to draw the ASCII art BSD brand above the boot loader menu.  The commands
     of brand.4th by themselves are not enough for most uses.  Please refer to
     the examples below for the most common situations, and to loader(8) for
     additional commands.

     Before using any of the commands provided in brand.4th, it must be
     included through the command:

           include brand.4th

     This line is present in the default /boot/menu.rc file, so it is not
     needed (and should not be re-issued) in a normal setup.

     The commands provided by it are:

           draw-brand             Draws the BSD brand.

                                  The brand that is drawn is configured by
                                  setting the loader_brand variable in
                                  loader.conf(5) to one of “fbsd” (the
                                  default) or “none”.

                                  The position of the logo can be configured
                                  by setting the loader_brand_x and
                                  loader_brand_y variables in loader.conf(5).
                                  The default values are 2 (x) and 1 (y).

     The environment variables that effect its behavior are:

           loader_brand
                     Selects the desired brand in the beastie boot menu.
                     Possible values are: “fbsd” (default) or “none”.

           loader_brand_x
                     Sets the desired column position of the brand.  Default
                     is 2.

           loader_brand_y
                     Sets the desired row position of the brand.  Default is
                     1.
