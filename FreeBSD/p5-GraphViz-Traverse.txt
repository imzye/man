GraphViz::Traverse(3)                      User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       GraphViz::Traverse - Build a GraphViz object via callback traversal

SYNOPSIS
         use GraphViz::Traverse;

DESCRIPTION
       A "GraphViz::Traverse" object represents a base class for inheriting by
       other traversal modules.

PUBLIC METHODS
   new
         my $g = GraphViz::Traverse->new($arguments);

       Return a new GraphViz::Traverse instance.  Valid arguments are listed
       below (taken from "man dot" and GraphViz::Traverse):

         _DEBUG       = Class instance setting
         bgcolor      = Class instance setting
         center       = n a non-zero value centers the drawing on the page.
         color        = color value sets foreground color (bgcolorfor background).
         concentrate  = Class instance setting
         directed     = Class instance setting
         epsilon      = Class instance setting
         height       = Class instance setting
         href         = "url" the default url for image map files; in PostScript files, the base URL for all relative URLs, as recognized by Acrobat Distiller 3.0 and up.
         layers       = "id:id:id:id" is a sequence of layer identifiers for overlay diagrams. The PostScript array variable layercolorseqsets the assignment of colors to layers. The least indexis1and each element must be a 3-ele- ment array to be interpreted as a color coordinate.
         layout       = Class instance setting
         margin       = f sets the page margin (included in the page size).
         no_overlap   = Class instance setting
         nodesep      = f sets the minimum separation between nodes.
         nslimit      = f ormclimit=f adjusts the bound on the number of network simplexormincross iterations by the givenratio. For example,mclimit=2.0runs twice as long.
         ordering     = out constrains order of out-edges in a subgraph according to their file sequence.
         overlap      = Class instance setting
         page         = "x,y" sets the PostScript pagination unit.
         pagedir      = [TBLR][TBLR] sets the major and minor order of pagination.
         pageheight   = Class instance setting
         pagewidth    = Class instance setting
         random_start = Class instance setting
         rank         = same (or minor max) inasubgraph constrains the rank assignment of its nodes. If a subgraph's name has the prefixcluster, its nodes are drawn in a distinct rectangle of the layout. Clusters may be nested.
         rankdir      = LR|RL|BT requests a left-to-right, right-to-left, or bottom-to-top, drawing.
         ranksep      = f sets the minimum separation between ranks.
         ratio        = f sets the aspect ratio tof which may be a floating point number, orone of the keywordsfill, compress,orauto.
         rotate       = 90 sets landscape mode. (orientation=landis backward compatible but obsolete.)
         size         = "x,y" sets bounding box of drawing in inches.
         stylesheet   = "file.css" includes a reference to a stylesheet in -Tsvg and -Tsvgz outputs. Ignored by other formats.
         URL          = "url" ("URL" is a synonym for "href".)
         width        = Class instance setting

   mark_item
         $g->mark_item( $node );
         $g->mark_item( $child, $parent );

       Add a node or an edge to the "GraphViz::Traverse" object.  This method
       is to be used by the "traverse" method.

   traverse
         $g->traverse($root);

       Traverse a structure starting at a given root node.  This method is to
       be overridden by an inheriting class with specific traversal actions
       for the "GraphViz" "dot" attributes listed below.  Please see
       GraphViz::Traverse::Filesystem for an example of this attribute
       overriding.

         fontsize
         height
         href
         label

         URL
         width

       Edge attributes:
