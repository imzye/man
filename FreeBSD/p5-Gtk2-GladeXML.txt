NAME
       Gtk2::GladeXML - (DEPRECATED) Create user interfaces directly from
       Glade XML files.

SYNOPSIS
         # for a pure gtk+ glade project
         use Gtk2 -init;
         use Gtk2::GladeXML;
         $gladexml = Gtk2::GladeXML->new('example.glade');
         $gladexml->signal_autoconnect_from_package('main');
         $quitbtn = $gladexml->get_widget('Quit');
         Gtk2->main;

         # for glade files using gnome widgets, you must initialize Gnome2
         # before loading the glade file.
         use Gnome2;
         use Gtk2::GladeXML;
         # this call also initializes gtk+ for us
         Gnome2::Program->init ($appname, $version);
         $gladexml = Gtk2::GladeXML->new('gnomeapp.glade');
         Gtk2->main;

ABSTRACT
       DEPRECATED Gtk2::GladeXML allows Perl programmers to use libglade, a C
       library which generates graphical user interfaces directly from the XML
       output of the Glade user interface designer.

       This module has been deprecated by the Gtk-Perl project.  This means
       that the module will no longer be updated with security patches, bug
       fixes, or when changes are made in the Perl ABI.  The Git repo for this
       module has been archived (made read-only), it will no longer possible
       to submit new commits to it.  You are more than welcome to ask about
       this module on the Gtk-Perl mailing list, but our priorities going
       forward will be maintaining Gtk-Perl modules that are supported and
       maintained upstream; this module is neither.

       Since this module is licensed under the LGPL v2.1, you may also fork
       this module, if you wish, but you will need to use a different name for
       it on CPAN, and the Gtk-Perl team requests that you use your own
       resources (mailing list, Git repos, bug trackers, etc.) to maintain
       your fork going forward.

       Glade is a free user interface builder for GTK+ and GNOME.  After
       designing a user interface with glade-2 the layout and configuration
       are saved in an XML file.  libglade is a library which knows how to
       build and hook up the user interface described in the Glade XML file at
       application run time.

       This extension module binds libglade to Perl so you can create and
       manipulate user interfaces in Perl code in conjunction with Gtk2 and
       even Gnome2.  Better yet you can load a file's contents into a PERL
       scalar do a few magical regular expressions to customize things and the
       load up the app. It doesn't get any easier.

FUNCTIONS
       $gladexml = Gtk2::GladeXML->new(GLADE_FILE, [ROOT, DOMAIN])
           Create a new GladeXML object by loading the data in GLADE_FILE.
           ROOT is an optional parameter that specifies a point (widget node)
           from which to start building.  DOMAIN is an optional parameter that
           specifies the translation domain for the xml file.

       $gladexml = Gtk2::GladeXML->new_from_buffer(BUFFER, [ROOT, DOMAIN])
           Create a new GladeXML object from the scalar string contained in
           BUFFER.  ROOT is an optional parameter that specifies a point
           (widget node) from which to start building.  DOMAIN is an optional
           parameter that specifies the translation domain for the xml file.

       $widget = $gladexml->get_widget(NAME)
           Return the widget created by the XML file with NAME or undef if no
           such name exists.

       $gladexml->signal_autoconnect($callback[, $userdata])
           Iterates over all signals and calls the given callback:

              sub example_cb {
                 my ($name, $widget, $signal, $signal_data, $connect, $after, $userdata) = @_;
              }

           The following two convenience methods use this to provide a more
           convenient interface.

       $gladexml->signal_autoconnect_from_package([PACKAGE or OBJECT])
           Sets up the signal handling callbacks as specified in the glade XML
           data.

           The argument to this method can be a Perl package name or an
           object.  If a package name is used, each handler named in the Glade
           XML data will be called as a subroutine in the named package.  If
           an object is supplied each handler will be called as a method of
           the object.  If no argument is supplied, the name of the calling
           package will be used.  A user data argument cannot be supplied
           however this is seldom necessary when an object is used.

           The names of the subroutines or methods must exactly match the
           handler name in the XML data.  It is worth noting that callbacks
           you get for free in c such as gtk_main_quit will not exist in perl
           and must always be defined, for example:

             sub gtk_main_quit
             {
                   Gtk2->main_quit;
             }

           Otherwise behavior should be exactly as expected with the use of
           libglade from a C application.

       $gladexml->signal_autoconnect_all (name => handler, ...)
           Iterates over all named signals and tries to connect them to the
           handlers specified as arguments (handlers not given as argument are
           being ignored). This is very handy when implementing your own
           widgets, where you can't use global callbacks.

       $widget = Gtk2::Glade->set_custom_handler ($callback[, $userdata])
           This method tells Gtk2::GladeXML how to create handlers for custom
           widgets.

           You can specify a "custom" widget in a glade file, which allows you
           to include in your interface widgets that Glade itself doesn't know
           how to create.  To tell libglade how to instantiate such widgets,
           you specify a "custom widget handler", a function which returns a
           Gtk2:Widget object for that custom widget.  This handler needs to
           be installed sometime before the instantiation of your
           Gtk2::GladeXML object, by calling "set_custom_handler".

               my $widget = Gtk2::Glade->set_custom_handler( \&my_handler );
               my $gladexml = Gtk2::GladeXML->new( 'MyApp.glade' );

           The prototype for the custom handler is:

               sub my_handler {
                   my ($xml,       # The Gtk2::GladeXML object
                       # the remaining arguments are as specified in the glade file:
                       $func_name, # The function name
                       $name,      # the name of the widget to be created
                       $str1,      # the string1 property
                       $str2,      # the string2 property
                       $int1,      # the int1 property
                       $int2,      # the int2 property
                       $userdata   # the data passed to set_custom_handler
                      ) = @_;
                   ...
                   return $widget; # a new Gtk2::Widget; you must call ->show on it.
               }

FAQ
       Where is the option to generate Perl source in Glade?
           Glade itself only creates the XML description, and relies on extra
           converter programs to write source code; only a few converters are
           widely popular.

           In general, however, you don't want to generate source code for a
           variety of reasons, mostly to do with maintainability.  This
           message on the glade-devel list explains it best:

           http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/glade-devel/2003-February/000015.html

       Why does my program crash on startup?
           Does your glade file use Gnome widgets?  If so, you must initialize
           Gnome manually; libglade can knows how to create gnome widgets, but
           can't know how you want to initialize the app.  This is usually
           sufficient:

             use Gnome2;
             Gnome2::Program->init ($app_name, $version_string);
