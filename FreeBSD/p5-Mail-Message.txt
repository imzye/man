Mail::Box::FastScalar(3)                   User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Mail::Box::FastScalar - fast alternative to IO::Scalar

DESCRIPTION
       Contributed by "Todd Richmond" (richmond@proofpoint.com)  This package
       should be released as separate package, but till then is incorporated
       in the Mail::Box module.

       Extremely fast IO::Scalar replacement - >20x improvement in
       getline(s)()

   Warnings
       You cannot modify the original reference between calls unless you
       "$obj-"seek(1, 0)> to reset the object - VERY rare usage case

       $/ must be undef or string - "" and \scalar unimplemented
