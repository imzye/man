           use Net::Google::Code;

           my $project = Net::Google::Code->new( project => 'net-google-code' );

           # loads all the downloads
           $project->load_downloads;
           my $downloads = $project->downloads;

           $project->load_wikis;
           my $wikis = $project->wikis;

DESCRIPTION
       Net::Google::Code is a simple client library for projects hosted in
       Google Code.

       Since 0.15, Net::Google::Code offers google's official issues api
       support.  Besides the new "Net::Google::Code::Issue::list",
       "Net::Google::Code::Issue::Comment::list" and
       <Net::Googlel::Code::Issue::load_comments> methods, which use the api
       from start, you can set $Net::Google::Code::Issue::USE_HYBRID to true
       to load, create and update issue with the api too.

       But the official api is not function complete yet( e.g. no attachment
       support, can't merge, etc. ), Net::Google::Code will back to the
       scraping way to accomplish those stuff.
