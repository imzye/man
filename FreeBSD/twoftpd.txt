twoftpd-auth(1)         FreeBSD General Commands Manual        twoftpd-auth(1)

NAME
       twoftpd-auth - TwoFTPD authentication front-end

SYNOPSIS
       twoftpd-auth cvmodule twoftpd-xfer

DESCRIPTION
       twoftpd-auth reads a username and password from the network and
       authenticates them using the CVM module cvmodule.  If the
       authentication succeeds, it sets the environment variables UID, GID,
       HOME, and USER to the user's UID, GID, home directory, and login name
       respectively, and then executes twoftpd-xfer.  It also sets GROUP if
       the CVM reports a group name, and AUTHENTICATED to 1 (twoftpd-auth and
       twoftpd-xfer look for this variable to determine what startup banner
       code to use).

ENVIRONMENT
       AUTH_ATTEMPTS
              The maximum number of authentication attempts to allow before
              dropping the connection.

       AUTH_TIMEOUT
              The maximum number of seconds to wait for successful
              authentication.

       LOGINBANNER
              If set, the contents of this variable will be sent as extra
              responses before the user logs in.

       TIMEOUT
              The maximum number of seconds to wait for command input.
