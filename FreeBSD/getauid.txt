     getauid – retrieve audit session ID

SYNOPSIS
     #include <bsm/audit.h>

     int
     getauid(au_id_t *auid);

DESCRIPTION
     The getauid() system call retrieves the active audit session ID for the
     current process via the au_id_t pointed to by auid.

     This system call requires an appropriate privilege to complete.

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion, the value 0 is returned; otherwise the
     value -1 is returned and the global variable errno is set to indicate the
     error.

ERRORS
     The getauid() function will fail if:

     [EFAULT]           A failure occurred while data transferred from the
                        kernel failed.

     [EPERM]            The process does not have sufficient permission to
                        complete the operation.
