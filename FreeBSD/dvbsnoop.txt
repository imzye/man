Name
       dvbsnoop - DVB and MPEG stream analyzer

SYNOPSIS
       dvbsnoop [-s mode] [options] pid

       dvbsnoop [-s mode] [options] -if filename [pid]

       dvbsnoop [-s mode] [options] -b [pid] > binary.file

       dvbsnoop [-s mode] [options]



Description
       DVBSNOOP is a text based DVB and MPEG stream analyzer for
       viewing/debugging stream information, e.g. send via digital TV. You may
       also use dvbsnoop to analyze mpeg compliant streams stored on DVD or
       other media.  Dvbsnoop analyzes and displays MPEG, DVB, DSM-CC, MHP,
       etc. data and structures in human readable form. Possible stream types
       are TS (tranport streams), PS (program streams), PES (packetized
       elementary streams) or SECTIONS (service information streams).

       DVBSNOOP also has some additional functionallity to analyze receiver
       (set top box, dvb card) data, bandwidth of a transport stream, pid
       scan, etc.

       Using special network programs like netcat (nc), dvbsnoop may also be
       used to do remote sniffing and decoding. For post-processing dvbsnoop
       output, you may use the full range of unix tools and scripting
       languages (grep, perl, python, mrtg, gnuplot, etc.).



Usage
       Dvbsnoop provides an online and offline input and different
       snoop/decoding modes (see below).

       Using dvbsnoop 'online' requires dvb-api compliant devices
       (http://www.linuxtv.org) to grab live stream information from e.g.
       satellite or cable tv or data streams. You will also need DVB compliant
       hardware (e.g. DVB-S pci card or a linux based setop box like dbox2 or
       Dreambox) to receive DVB data streams. To tune into a transponder or
       frequency, please use a program like 'szap', 'dvbtune' or a DVB-GUI
       like 'Enigma', 'Neutrino', 'MythTV', 'VDR', etc..

       The 'offline' mode enables you to analyze binary stream files (e.g.
       transport stream files or PES files).

       Some options are specific for the selected modes. You may try different
       combinations of command line options to get best results.

       A short FAQ for common questions and example decoding output can be
       found at http://dvbsnoop.sourceforge.net.



Basic Decoding Selection Mode Command Line Options
       -s [ts|ps|pes|sec|pidscan|bandwidth|signal|feinfo]
               Basic snoop mode selection.
                 sec      = SI mode (SECTIONS)
                 ts       = transport stream mode
                 ps       = program stream mode (same as PES mode)
                 pes      = packetized elementary stream mode,
                             e.g. teletext, audio, video, data
                 pidscan  = scan and display PIDs on tuned
                             transponder/frequency.
                 bandwith = bandwidth messurement mode
                             for selected pid.
                 signal   = display tuner signal reception info.
                 feinfo   = display tuner data (frontend info).

              The modes 'sec', "ps" or "pes" require the selection of a PID.
              The mode 'ts' requires either a PID specified or the option
              -tsraw.

              A PID can be specified using octal, decimal or hexadecimal
              values.  Examples:  octal: 021, decimal: 17, hexadecimal: 0x11

              If -s option is omitted, default mode is "-s sec" (Section
              mode).



General Command Line Options
       -help
              Print help text with command line options.

       -hideproginfo
              Do not print dvbsnoop header (version, etc.).



General Decoding Output Command Line Options
       -pd <mode>
              Specify print decoding verbose mode. Specify 0 for no output.  9
              will be very verbose. Default is 6.

       -npd
              Same as -pd 0.


       -ph <mode>
              Specify print hex putput verbose mode:
               0=no hexdump output, 1=hex output, 2=hex line,
               3=ascii line, 4=alternate hex output. (default is 4)

       -hexdumpbuffer

       -nohexdumpbuffer
              Switch on/off hexdump of stream input buffer.  May be used to
              enhance -ph option. (e.g. -ph 4 -nohexdumpbuffer)

       -nph
              Obsolete, same as -nohexdumpbuffer.


       -t<mode>
              Timestamp output mode:
                 -tf = full timestamp
                 -td = delta timestamp mode,
                 -tn = no time stamp.


       -b
              Binary output of packets (disables other output).  Use this
              option to store raw data in file or chain data to another
              program.
                 E.g.:  dvbsnoop -s ts 0x00 -b > file
                        dvbsnoop -s pes 0x3FF -b | ./myprogram

              There might be a file limit on your system (mostly 2 GB) when
              writing files using '>'.



Device Selection Command Line Options
       Dvbsnoop uses default devices, defined by the DVB API.  On some
       platforms or if using multiple dvb cards, you may want to override
       default settings, e.g. to select a different tuner.

       -demux <device>
              Specify <device> for demux.  If not specified, dvbsnoop uses the
              device specified by the linux  dvb-api.

       -dvr <device>
              Specify <device> for dvr.  If not specified, dvbsnoop uses the
              device specified by the linux  dvb-api.

       -frontend <device>
              Specify <device> for frontend.  If not specified, dvbsnoop uses
              the device specified by the linux  dvb-api.

       -adapter <n>
              Specify DVB adapter/card by number <n> (0-9) using default path
              pattern (e.g. /dev/dvb/adapter1/...). If not specified, dvbsnoop
              uses the default adapter/card - usually 0.

       -devnr <n>
              Specify DVB device number <n> (0-9) on a DVB adapter/card using
              default path pattern (e.g. /dev/dvb/adapt.../demux1). If not
              specified, dvbsnoop uses the default device number - usually 0.


       -buffersize <kb>
              Set demux read buffersize in KBytes.  Default is 0 (use internal
              default value).


       -n <value>
              Stop after reading <value> packets. Use this to limit the read
              process.  Default is 0 (no limit).


       -if <file>
              Read binary stream data from file instead of the demux device.
                <file> = '-' reads from standard input.  Depending on the
              decoding mode this might be transport stream, packetized
              elemtary stream or sections.  Please aware, that you cannot e.g.
              use -s pes or -s sec on a saved transport stream.  The
              decoding/snooping mode has to match the saved stream format!



SECTION Mode (SEC) Specific Command Line Options
       The following command line options are special to the 'SECTION'
       decoding mode:

       -s sec
              Section mode.

       -timeout <ms>
              Section read timeout in ms. Default is 0 (no timeout).

       -f <filter>
              Filter value for filtering section data e.g. table id's.  Value
              may be decimal (49), octal (037) or hexadecimal (0x4F).  You may
              use multibyte filters like: 0x4E.01.20.FF The filter comprises
              e.g. 16 bytes covering byte 0 and byte 3..17 in a section, thus
              excluding bytes 1 and 2 (the length field of a section).  To
              check the filtervalues use -pd 9.

       -m <mask>
              Mask value to use for filters.  Value may be decimal (49), octal
              (037) or hexadecimal (0x4F).  You may use multibyte filters
              like: 0xFF.F0.FE.FF The filter comprises e.g. 16 bytes covering
              byte 0 and byte 3..17 in a section, thus excluding bytes 1 and 2
              (the length field of a section).  To check the filtervalues use
              -pd 9.


       -N <value>
              Stop after decoding <value> packets. Use this to limit the
              packet decoding process.  Useful, when reading stream data from
              file.  -n limits the read packet process, -N limits the decoding
              process. Using dvb hardware filters -n would be the same as -N.
              Default is 0 (no limit).


       -crc
              Do CRC checking, when reading section data.  Default is off.
              This is only supported, if your DVB hardware/firmware supports
              CRC checking.  Remark: Some section types may use Checksum
              instead of CRC.

       -nocrc
              Don't do hardware/firmware CRC, when reading section data
              (default).  Some DVB sections do not have proper CRC set!


       -softcrc
              Do soft CRC checking, when reading section data.
              Hardware/firmware CRC should be preferred. Default is
              -nosoftcrc.  Remark: Some section types may use Checksum instead
              of CRC.

       -nosoftcrc
              Don't do soft CRC, when reading sections. (default)


       -spiderpid
              Snoop referenced section PIDs.  This option recursivly reads all
              PIDs referenced by a section. This option also sets number of
              packets to be read to 1 (sets -n 1). To read more packets for a
              pid, use -n <count> after specifying -spiderpid.

       -privateprovider <id>
              Set provider <id> string for decoding of special private tables
              and descriptors. Use -help to display provider currently
              supported. If omitted, private data will be displayed as hexdump
              depending on -ph option. (If you have information on private
              data structures, currently not supported by dvbsnoop, please let
              us know!)



Transport Stream (TS) Mode Specific Command Line Options
       The following command line options are special to the 'Transport
       Stream'  decoding mode:

       -s ts
              Transport Stream mode.

       -sync
              (obsolete as of 1.4.10, -sync is default. This option enforces
              software packet sync for TS and PS/PES).

       -nosync
              (obsolete as of 1.4.10).


       -tssubdecode
              Sub-decode SI data (sections) or PS/PES data from transport
              stream decoding. This reads transport stream packets and tries
              to decode its content.  Useful to decode PES or SI data from a
              transport stream file.


       -tsraw
              Read full transport stream (all pids).  Your hardware/firmware
              has to support this mode.


       -N <value>
              Stop after decoding <value> packets. Use this to limit the
              packet decoding process.  Useful, when reading stream data from
              file.  -n limits the read packet process, -N limits the decoding
              process. Using dvb hardware filters -n would be the same as -N.
              Default is 0 (no limit).



PES or PS Mode Specific Command Line Options
       The following command line options are special to the 'PES' (packetized
       elementary stream) or 'PS' (program stream) decoding mode:

       -s ps  Program Stream mode.

       -s pes
              Packetized Elementary Stream mode.

       -sync
              (obsolete as of 1.4.10, -sync is default. This option enforces
              software packet sync for TS and PS/PES).

       -nosync
              (obsolete as of 1.4.10).

PID Scan Mode Specific Command Line Options
       The following command line options are special to the 'PID Scan'
       discovery mode:

       -s pidscan
              Scan PIDs on transponder/frequency.

       -maxdmx <n>
              Set maximum use of DMX filters.  Default is 0 (use all possible
              filters).



Bandwidth Mode Specific Command Line Options
       There are no special command line options for the 'Bandwidth' display
       mode.

       -s bandwidth
              Determine bandwidth for a dvb stream. This will be done by
              calculating received ts packets in a timeslot.



Signal Mode Specific Command Line Options
       There are no special command line options for the 'Signal Strength'
       display mode.

       -s signal
              Poll frontend signal status.

       -timeout <ms>
              Poll timing in msec.



Frontend Info Mode Specific Command Line Options
       There are no special command line options for the 'Frontend Info'
       display  mode.

       -s feinfo
              Display frontend information.

          dvbsnoop -s pidscan -pd 6
          dvbsnoop -s pidscan -pd 9 -maxdmx 12

       Show frontend info:
          dvbsnoop -s feinfo -pd 9

       Try to scan all sections, read 2 packets per PID:
          dvbsnoop -nohexdumpbuffer -spiderpid -n 2  0x0000

       Save 1000 packets of a transport stream to a file:
          dvbsnoop -b -n 1000 -s ts  0x200  > ts_file.pid0x200.bin
          dvbsnoop -b -n 1000 -s ts -tsraw  > ts_file.bin

          dvbsnoop -s ts -nph 0x100 | grep -i 'Transport_error\|^PID'

       Selecting devices:
          dvbsnoop -s feinfo -pd 9 -frontend /dev/dvb/adapter0/frontend1
          dvbsnoop -s feinfo -pd 9 -adapter 0 -devnr 1
          dvbsnoop -s feinfo -pd 9 -adapter 2

       Sending dvbsnoop data over network, using netcat:
          dvbsnoop -s pes 0x28F -b    nc -q  ServerName 31337

       Do remote decoding of dvb data over network using dvbsnoop and netcat:
         streaming site:
             dvbsnoop -s ts 0x0065 -b    nc -q  ServerName 31000
         reveiving site:
             nc -l -p 31000    dvbsnoop -nph -s ts -tssubdecode -if -

         You may also use e.g. dvbtools for sending dvb data over a network:
             dvbstream ....  -->  dumprtp  dvbsnoop -s ts -if -





NOTES
       dvbsnoop tries to decode all of the data it receives, e.g. if you try
       to decode a video or audio stream in section mode, dvbsnoop may assume
       a section table and will decode the data wrong. In this case the
       decoding will be garbage. Using the '-crc' option should prevent this
       (if supported at the hardware/driver level).
       dvbsnoop does not do DVB stream validation.  dvbsnoop assumes correct
       DVB streams. Corrupted streams or streams with wrong semantics (e.g.
       incorrect length information) will result in wrong decoding output. For
       this reason, the use of '-crc' options is strongly recommended.
       Depending on the firmware of your dvb card, dvbsnoop may not be able to
       sniff on pids, which are occupied by other processes. This is no bug,
       this is a driver/firmware issue.



SIGNALS
       dvbsnoop  catches signals to provide smooth program termination.
          SIGHUP, SIGQUIT and SIGTERM  will terminate dvbsnoop smoothly.
          SIGABORT will abort at once after flushing buffers.
          SIGKILL  will just kill down dvbsnoop (OS specific).
