MusicBrainz::DiscID(3)                     User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       MusicBrainz::DiscID - Perl interface for the MusicBrainz libdiscid
       library

SYNOPSIS
         use MusicBrainz::DiscID;

         my $discid = MusicBrainz::DiscID->new();
         if ( $disc->read() == 0 ) {
             print STDERR "Error: " . $discid->error_msg() . "\n";
             exit(1);
         }
         print "DiscID: " . $discid->id() . "\n";

DESCRIPTION
       MusicBrainz::DiscID is a class to calculate a MusicBrainz DiscID from
       an audio CD in the drive. The coding style is slightly different to the
       C interface to libdiscid, because it makes use of perl's Object
       Oriented functionality.

       MusicBrainz::DiscID::default_device()
           Returns a device string for the default device for this platform.

       MusicBrainz::DiscID::new( [$device] )
           Construct a new DiscID object.

           As an optional argument the name of the device to read the ID from
           may be given. If you don't specify a device here you can later read
           the ID with the read method.

       $discid->error_msg()
           Return a human-readable error message of the last error that
           occured.

       $discid->first_track_num()
           Return the number of the first track on this disc (usually 1).
           Returns undef if no ID was yet read.

       $discid->last_track_num()
           Return the number of the last track on this disc.

       $discid->id()
           Returns the DiscID as a string.  Returns undef if no ID was yet
           read.

       $discid->last_track_num()
           Return the number of the last track on this disc.  Returns undef if
           no ID was yet read.

       $discid->put( $first_track, $sectors, $offset1, $offset2, ... )
           This function may be used if the TOC has been read earlier and you
           want to calculate the disc ID afterwards, without accessing the
           disc drive.

       $discid->read( [$device] )
           Read the disc ID from the given device.  If no device is given the
           default device of the platform will be used.  On error, this
           function returns false and sets the error message which you can
           access $discid->error_msg().

       $discid->sectors()
           Return the length of the disc in sectors.  Returns undef if no ID
           was yet read.

       $discid->submission_url()
           Returns a submission URL for the DiscID as a string.  Returns undef
           if no ID was yet read.

       $discid->track_length( $track_num )
           Return the length of a track in sectors.

       $discid->track_offset( $track_num )
           Return the sector offset of a track.
