DESCRIPTION
       oneko changes your mouse cursor into mouse and creates a little cute
       cat and the cat start chasing around your mouse cursor.  If the cat
       catchup the ``mouse'', start sleeping.

   Options
       -help  Prints help message on usage.

       -tora  Make cat into "tora-neko".  "Tora-neko" means cat wite tiger-
              like stripe.  I don't know how to say it in English.

       -dog   Runs a dog instead of a cat.

       -bsd_daemon

       -bsd   Same as -bsd_daemon.

       -sakura
              Runs Sakura Kinomoto instead of a cat.

       -tomoyo
              Runs Tomoyo Daidouji instead of a cat.

       -time interval
              Sets interval timer which determine intervals for cat animation.
              Default value is 125000 and unit is micro-second.  Smaller value
              makes cat run faster.

       -speed distance
              Specify the distance where cat jumps at one move in dot
              resolution.  Default is 16.

       -idle speed
              Specify the threshold of the speed which ``mouse'' running away
              to wake cat up.

       -name name
              Specify the window name of cat.

       -towindow
              When oneko starts with this option, you must select a window by
              cursor.  Then cat appears and starts chasing the window instead
              of mouse.  You can select another running oneko as the target
              window.  If root window is selected, cat chases mouse as
              usually.  When the target window is not in sight and not closed,
              cat chases mouse as usually.  If the target window is closed,
              this program exit.

       -toname name
              Specify the window name of target to make cat chase it instead
              of mouse.  You can specify another running oneko as the target
              window.  When the target window is not in sight and not closed,
              cat chases mouse as usually.  If the target window is closed,
              this program exit.

       -tofocus
              Makes cat run to and on top of focus window.  When focus window
              is not in sight, cat chases mouse as usually.

       -position geometry
              Specify X and Y offsets in pixels to adjust position of cat
              relative to mouse pointer.

       -rv    Reverse background color and foreground color.

       -noshape
              Don't use SHAPE extension.

       idle   Sets speed threshold to wake cat up when ``mouse'' running away.

       noshape
              Set ``True'' if you don't want to use SHAPE extension.
