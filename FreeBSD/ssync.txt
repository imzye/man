NAME
       ssync - minimalistic filesystem sync tool

SYNOPSIS
       ssync [options]

       ssyncd [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Ssync is a minimalistic filesystem synchronization utility. Its primary
       goals are reliability, correctness, and speed in syncing extremely
       large filesystems over fast, local network connections. Ssync does not
       implement encryption, compression, differencing algorithms, or remote
       synchronization over a pipe such as rsh / ssh since those features are
       already well covered by other utilities such as rsync.

       Ssync works well on large filesystems and can handle filesystem objects
       with unusual and non-ASCII characters in their names while correctly
       preserving all symbolic and hard links and all mode bits. It can be run
       at increased or decreased niceness and can provide several levels of
       logging output. Several options allow complete control of
       synchronization behaviors such as selectively disabling updating of
       data, ownership, and modes, as well as updating only newer objects or
       just performing 'test runs'.

       The basic behavior of both interactive and daemon versions of the
       program is to read a list of source and destination paths from a
       specified work file and take whatever actions are necessary to make the
       destinations identical to the sources.  Each line of the work file
       takes the form:

       <source path> | <destination path>

       Any text following a # character to end of line in the work file is
       considered a comment and ignored.

OPTIONS
       All options may be set on the command line in either short or long form
       as well as in a configuration file. For the interactive version
       (ssync), the default configuration file is .ssyncrc in the current
       directory. For the daemon (ssyncd), /usr/local/etc/ssyncd.conf is the
       default. Settings in the configuration file have the same name as the
       long option and take a form such as:

       work-file: /usr/local/etc/ssyncd.work

       Any text following a # character to end of line in the configuration
       file is considered a comment and ignored. Example configuration and
       work files, as well as some more extensive development rationale may be
       found in the file README.HTML.  If you installed a binary package, this
       file as well as some examples should be located in your distribution's
       doc directory for this package. If you built from a source tarball,
       then it should have included the documentation and example files.

       -h --help
              display usage message and version

       -c PATH --conf-path=PATH
              read alternative config file from the default

       -i NUM --interval=NUM
              number of seconds to sleep between completing one run and
              starting the next

       -w PATH --work-file=PATH
              path for file containing work list (see also src-path and dst-
              path)

       -f PATH --src-path=PATH
              alternative way to specify a single source path

       -t PATH --dst-path=PATH
              alternative way to specify a single destination path

       -n (-20 - +20) --priority=(-20 - +20)
              scheduling priority or 'niceness', lower numbers are more rude,
              see renice(8), for more details

       -F --no-detach
              do not daemonize (use with log-mode: stderr)

       -D --no-sync-data
              do not sync data (content) of files

       -T --no-sync-time
              do not sync atime / mtime

       -M --no-sync-meta
              do not sync meta-data (uid / gid / mode)

       -U --update-only
              only sync things if source mtime is > destination mtime

       -X --test
              run sync procedure and collect statistics without actually
              modifying anything

       -p PATH --pid-path=PATH
              path for pid file

       -m (file|syslog|stderr) --log-mode=(file|syslog|stderr)
              logging mode

       -l PATH --log-path=PATH
              path for log file if using file based logging

       -s STRING --log-ident=STRING
              identification string if using syslog based logging

       -v (0 - 5) --log-level=(0 - 5)
              logging verbosity, 2 is default, 3 is errors only, 0 lists all
              updates and deletions

FILES
       $PWD/.ssync
              default configuration file for ssync

       /usr/local/etc/ssyncd.conf
              default configuration file for ssyncd

       /usr/local/etc/ssyncd.work
              default work file for ssyncd

       /var/log/ssyncd.log
              default log file for ssyncd

       /var/run/ssyncd.pid
              default pid file for ssyncd

BUGS
       Due to the simple-mindedness of the configuration file parser, paths
       containing whitespaces and unusual characters in the work file will not
       be parsed properly. This limitation does not apply to anything
       underneath the specified paths, just the starting points as listed in
       the work file.
