IFDEPD(8)               FreeBSD System Manager's Manual              IFDEPD(8)

NAME
     ifdepd – Interface Dependancy daemon

SYNOPSIS
     ifdepd [-v|q] [-d] -S src-if1[:src-if2...] -D dst-if1[:dst-if2...]

DESCRIPTION
     The ifdepd daemon implements dependencies between network interfaces in a
     reliable way. If any of the source interfaces src-if1 ... src-ifn fails
     (hardware error, no carrier etc.), ifdepd sets all destination interfaces
     dst-if1 ... dst-ifn to state down. If all source interfaces src-if1 ...
     src-ifn are active, ifdepd sets all destination interfaces dst-if1 ...
     dst-ifn to state up.  For example, it can be used with carp(4) to provide
     failover functionality on gateways/firewalls.

     The following options are available:

     -v      Verbose mode. The details of interface state transitions are
             displayed on the user's terminal or in syslog messages if running
             in daemon mode.

     -q      Quiet mode. No messages are displayed.

     -d      Daemon mode. Run in background and log to syslog.

     -S src-if1[:src-if2...]
             Specify source interface(s).

     -D dst-if1[:dst-if2...]
             Specify destination interface(s).

EXAMPLES
           ifdepd -d -S em0:bge0 -D carp0:carp1

     Example for building a high available firewall system with carp(4).  The
     internal physical interface is em0 and the external physical interface is
     bge0, carp0 is the carp(4) interface for the internal physical interface
     em0 and carp1 is the carp(4) interface for the external physical
     interface bge0. If one of the physical interfaces em0 or bge0 fails,
     ifdepd sets both carp(4) interfaces carp0 and carp1 to down, which
     triggers a failover on the carp(4) layer.

SEE ALSO
     carp(4), pf(4), ifstated(8)

HISTORY
     The ifdepd program was written as an simple and reliable alternative for
     ifstated(8) to implement interface dependencies on redundant
     gateway/firewall systems which are using carp(4)
