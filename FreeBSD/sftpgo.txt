SFTPGO-ACME-RUN(1)               SFTPGo Manual              SFTPGO-ACME-RUN(1)



NAME
       sftpgo-acme-run - Register your account and obtain certificates



SYNOPSIS
       sftpgo acme run [flags]



DESCRIPTION
       This command must be run to obtain TLS certificates the first time or
       every time you add a new domain to your configuration file.
       Certificates are saved in the configured "certs_path".  After this
       initial step, the certificates are automatically checked and renewed by
       the SFTPGo service



OPTIONS
       -c, --config-dir="."     Location of the config dir. This directory is
       used as the base for files with a relative path, e.g. the private keys
       for the SFTP server or the database file if you use a file-based data
       provider.  The configuration file, if not explicitly set, is looked for
       in this dir. We support reading from JSON, TOML, YAML, HCL, envfile and
       Java properties config files. The default config file name is "sftpgo"
       and therefore "sftpgo.json", "sftpgo.yaml" and so on are searched.
       This flag can be set using SFTPGO_CONFIG_DIR env var too.


       --config-file=""    Path to SFTPGo configuration file.  This flag
       explicitly defines the path, name and extension of the config file. If
       must be an absolute path or a path relative to the configuration
       directory. The specified file name must have a supported extension
       (JSON, YAML, TOML, HCL or Java properties).  This flag can be set using
       SFTPGO_CONFIG_FILE env var too.
