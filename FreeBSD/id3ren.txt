DESCRIPTION
       id3ren is used to rename batches of mp3 files by reading the ID3 tag at
       the end of the file which contains the song name, artist, album, year,
       and a comment.  The secondary function of id3ren is a tagger, which can
       create, modify, or remove ID3 tags.


   OPTIONS
       -album ALBUM_NAME
              Sets the album name to use when tagging files. All files will be
              tagged with this album name without prompting.

       -album=ALBUM_NAME
              Sets the album name to use when tagging files. All files will be

       -artist=ARTIST_NAME

              be tagged with this artist name without prompting.


       -comment=COMMENT
              Sets the comment to use when tagging files. All files will be
              tagged with this comment without prompting.

              -copytagfrom

              -copytagfrom

              -copytagfrom

       -defcase
              Use the default case of characters from the ID3 tag when
              renaming files.  This is default.


       -default=DEFAULT
              Sets the default field to be used only when renaming if a field
              is blank.  Useful when renaming and creating "unknown"
              subdirectories.
               Defaults to "unknown".


       -edit  If a file already has a tag and you want to change just one
              specific field of the tag, use this option in conjunction with
              -tag and the option for the field you want to change.  For
              example to change just the album name of a file: id3ren -tag
              -edit -album="New Album Name" sample.mp3

              allowable genres use the -showgen argument.  -genre accepts
              either the number of the genre as displayed with -showgen, or

              CHARS indicates a string of characters that will be removed from
              the filename if found.


       -repchar=CHARS
              CHARS indicates a string of characters, EACH followed by the
              character to replace it with.  For example, to replace all plus
              '+' signs with a hyphen all '&' with '_', you would use
              '-repchar +-&_'.


       -searchgen=# | GENRE
              Searches the list of genres and displays either the genre name
              corresponding to #, or shows all substring matches of GENRE.


       -showgen
              Displays all the music genres currently in the program.


       -showtag
              Display the tags for the specified files.  No renaming is
              performed.


       -song=SONG_NAME
              Sets the song name to use when tagging files. All files will be
              tagged with this song name without prompting.


       -space=PSTRING
              Change all spaces in the renamed file to STRING. To remove all
              spaces, use


       -striptag
              Remove the tags for the specified files.
               * This option is a toggle.


       -tag   Always ask for a tag, even if the file already has one.
               * This option is a toggle.


       -tagfromfilename, -tagffn
              Use informations from the filename when tagging. See
              tagtemplate.
               * This option is a toggle.


       -tagonly
              Don't rename any files, just ask for tag information.  Note that
              -tagonly only asks for tag information on files that don't have
              a tag already.  To have it ask for a tag on all files, use with
              -tag.
               * This option is a toggle.


       -tagtemplate=TEMPLATE
              Use TEMPLATE as the basis for tagging files.  The default
              template used is '[%a]-[%s].mp3'.  Identifiers that can be used
              in the template are:
                %a  - Artist name
                %c  - Comment
                %s  - Song name
                %t  - Album title
                %n  - Track Number
                %y  - Year
                %g  - Genre
                %d  - Dummy
               It is a VERY good idea to have fixed separators between fields.


       -template=TEMPLATE
              Use TEMPLATE as the basis for renaming files.  The default
              template used is '[%a]-[%s].mp3'.  Identifiers that can be used
              in the template are:
                %a  - Artist name
                %c  - Comment
                %s  - Song name
                %t  - Album title
                %n  - Track Number
                %y  - Year
                %g  - Genre


       -track=TRACK
              Sets the track number to use when tagging files. All files will
              be tagged with this track number without prompting.  TRACK must
              be an integer between 1 and 99.


       -upper Convert file names to uppercase characters.


       -verbose
              Display more messages than usual.
               * This option is a toggle.


       -year=YEAR
              Sets the year to use when tagging files. All files will be
              tagged with this year without prompting.


       And of course the program accepts wildcards for filenames.
