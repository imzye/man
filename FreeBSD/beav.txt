NAME
       beav - binary file editor and viewer

SYNOPSIS
       beav [file...]

DESCRIPTION
       This is a brief description of the minimal set of commands that are
       necessary to start using beav effectively.  For more information,
       review the file /usr/local/share/doc/beav/beav.txt.

       The file-visit command, Ctl-X Ctl-V, can be used to read a file in for
       editing.   The file can also be read in from the command line; beav
       <edit_file>.

       Data is displayed in one or more windows.  These commands can be used
       to navigate around the windows.

              move-back-char      Ctl-B     moves left
              move-back-line      Ctl-P     moves up
              move-forw-char      Ctl-F     moves right
              move-forw-line      Ctl-N     moves down
              window-delete       Ctl-X 0   delete window
              window-expand       Ctl-X 1   expand window

       The move-to-byte command, Ctl-X G, will prompt you for a byte position
       to move to.

       These commands will insert a zero byte at the cursor position or delete
       the byte at that position.

              insert-unit         Ctl-X I
              delete-forw-unit    Esc D

       The file-save command, Ctl-X Ctl-S, will save the data to the file if a
       change has been made.

       The help command, Esc ?, will display a list of all commands and their
       current key bindings.

       The abort-cmd command, Ctl-G, will abort any command that is in
       operation.

       The quit-no-save command, Ctl-X Ctl-C, will exit beav.  If there is any
       data that has not been saved you will be warned.
