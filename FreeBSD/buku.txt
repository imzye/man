OPERATIONAL NOTES
       1.  The database file is stored in:
             - $BUKU_DEFAULT_DBDIR/bookmarks.db, if BUKU_DEFAULT_DBDIR is
           defined (first preference), or
             - $XDG_DATA_HOME/buku/bookmarks.db, if XDG_DATA_HOME is defined
           (second preference), or
             - $HOME/.local/share/buku/bookmarks.db, if HOME is defined (third
           preference), or
             - %APPDATA%\buku\bookmarks.db, if you are on Windows and APPDATA
           is defined (fourth preference), or
             - the current directory.

       2.  If the URL contains characters like ';', '&' or brackets they may
           be interpreted specially by the shell. To avoid it, add the URL
           within single or double quotes ('/").

       3.  URLs are unique in DB. The same URL cannot be added twice.

       4.  Bookmarks with immutable titles are listed with '(L)' after the
           title.

       5.  Tags:
             - Comma (',') is the tag delimiter in DB. A tag cannot have
           comma(s) in it. Tags are filtered (for unique tags) and sorted.
           Tags are stored in lower case and can be replaced, appended or
           deleted.
             - Page keywords having a word to comma ratio > 3 are appended to
           description rather than tags.
             - Parent folder (and subfolder) names are converted to all-
           lowercase tags during bookmarks HTML import.
             - Releases prior to v2.7 support both capital and lower cases in
           tags. From v2.7 all tags are stored in lowercase. An undocumented
           option --fixtags is introduced to modify the older tags. It also
           fixes another issue where the same tag appears multiple times in
           the tagset of a record. Run buku --fixtags once.
             - Tags can be edited from the prompt very easily using '>>'
           (append), '>' (overwrite) and '<<' (remove) symbols. The LHS of the
           operands denotes the indices and ranges of tags to apply (as listed
           by --tag or key 't' at prompt) and the RHS denotes the actual DB
           indices and ranges of the bookmarks to apply the change to.

       6.  Update operation:
             - If --title, --tag or --comment is passed without argument,
           clear the corresponding field from DB.
             - If --url is passed (and --title is omitted), update the title
           from web using the URL. Description is updated (if --comment is
           omitted). Tags remain untouched.
             - If indices are passed without any other options (--url,
           --title, --tag, --comment and --immutable), read the URLs from DB
           and update titles, description and append tags from web. Bookmarks
           marked immutable are skipped.
             - Can update bookmarks matching a search, when combined with any
           of the search options and no arguments to update are passed.
             - Additionally, --swap allows to modify records order (standalone
           operation).

       7.  Delete operation:
             - When a record is deleted, the last record is moved to the
           index.
             - Delete doesn't work with range and indices provided together as
           arguments. It's an intentional decision to avoid extra sorting, in-
           range checks and to keep the auto-DB compaction functionality
           intact. On the same lines, indices are deleted in descending order.
             - Can delete bookmarks matching a search, when combined with any
           of the search options and no arguments to delete are passed.

       8.  Search works in mysterious ways:
             - Case-insensitive.
             - Matches words in URL, title and tags.
             - --sany : match any of the keywords in URL, title, description
           or tags. Default search option.
             - --sall : match all the keywords in URL, title, description or
           tags.
             - --deep : match substrings (`match` matches `rematched`) in URL,
           title, description and tags.
             - --markers : match each keyword to a specific field, depending
           on its prefix.
             - --sreg : match a regular expression (ignores --deep).
             - --stag : search bookmarks by tags, or list all tags
           alphabetically with usage count (if no arguments). Delimit the list
           of tags in the query with `,` to search for bookmarks that match
           ANY of the listed tags. Delimit tags with `+` to search for
           bookmarks that match ALL of the listed tags. Note that `,` and `+`
           cannot be used together in the same search. Exclude bookmarks
           matching certain tags from the results by using ` - ` followed by
           the tags. Note that the ` - ` operator and the ` + ` delimiter must
           be space separated: ` - ` instead of `-` and ` + ` instead of `+`.
           This is to distinguish them from hyphenated tags (e.g., `some-tag-
           name`) and tags with '+'s (e.g., `some+tag+name`).
             - Search for keywords along with tag filtering is possible. Two
           searches are issued (one for keywords and another for tags) and the
           intersection of the 2 sets is returned as the resultset.
             - Search results are indexed incrementally. This index is
           different from actual database index of a bookmark record which is
           shown within '[]' after the title.
             - Results for any keyword matches are ordered by the number of
           keyword matches - results matching more keywords (match score) will
           appear earlier in the list. Results having the same number of
           matches will be ranked by their record DB index. If only one
           keyword is searched, results will be ordered by DB index, since all
           matching records will have the same match score.
             - Sorting order can be specified (for matches with same amount of
           matched keywords, if relevant). This option also works with regular
           printing/export.

       9.  Import:
             - Auto-import looks in the default installation path and default
           user profile.
             - URLs starting with `place:`, `file://` and `apt:` are ignored
           during import.
             - Parent folder (and subfolder) names are automatically imported
           as tags if --tacit is used.
             - Tags are merged even if bookmark URL exists when --tacit is
           used.
             - JSON files exported from browser can be imported. Export to
           JSON is not supported.

       10. Encryption is optional and manual. AES256 algorithm is used. To use
           encryption, the database file should be unlocked (-k) before using
           buku and locked (-l) afterwards. Between these 2 operations, the
           database file lies unencrypted on the disk, and NOT in memory.
           Also, note that the database file is unencrypted on creation.

       11. Editor support:
             - A single bookmark can be edited before adding. The editor can
           be set using the environment variable *EDITOR* or by explicitly
           specifying the editor. The latter takes precedence. If -a is used
           along with -w, the details are populated in the editor template.
             - In case of edit and update (a single bookmark), the existing
           record details are fetched from DB and populated in the editor
           template. The environment variable EDITOR must be set. Note that -u
           works independently of -w.
             - All lines beginning with "#" will be stripped. Then line 1 will
           be treated as the URL, line 2 will be the title, line 3 will be
           comma separated tags, and the rest of the lines will be parsed as
           descriptions.

       12. Proxy support: please refer to the ENVIRONMENT section.

       13. Alternative DB file:
             - The option --db (to specify an alternative database file
           location) is app-only. Manual usage is prone to issues arising from
           human error.
             - Note that this option is useful if you want to store the db
           file in cloud synced location. Another mechanism could be to have
           the db file synced and create a symlink to it at the default
           location.
             - When the argument to --db contains neither `.` nor directory
           separator, it's considered a name and is resolved as the matching
           file with `.db` extension within the default DB directory.
             - When invoked specifically as buku --db, the program prints out
           the list of DB names in the default DB directory.
             - When running Bukuserver (webUI), alternative DB file can be
           specified via BUKUSERVER_DB_FILE environment variable.
           Additionally, the Bukuserver runner script supports switching
           between DB files within the default Buku DB folder.
             - In the interactive shell mode, the DB command can be used to
           similarly switch between DB files by name. (You can use non-
           standard extensions by specifying them, and switch directories by
           specifying a path – absolute or relative to the current DB. ~.
           stands for the default database.)

GENERAL OPTIONS
       -a --add URL [+|-] [tag, ...]
              Bookmark URL along with comma-separated tags. A tag can have
              multiple words. (These tags override fetched tags, unless
              preceded with '+' or '-'.)

       -u --update [...]
              Update fields of the bookmarks at specified indices in DB. If no
              arguments are specified, all titles and descriptions are
              refreshed from the web. Tags remain untouched. Works with update
              modifiers for the fields url, title, tag and comment. If only
              indices are passed without any edit options, titles and
              descriptions are fetched and updated (if not empty). Accepts
              hyphenated ranges and space-separated indices. Updates search
              results when used with search options, if no arguments.

       -w --write [editor|index]
              Edit a bookmark in editor before adding it. To edit and update
              an existing bookmark, the index should be passed. In this case
              the environment variable EDITOR must be set. The last record is
              opened in EDITOR if index=-1.

       -d --delete [...]
              Delete bookmarks. Accepts space-separated list of indices (e.g.
              5 6 23 4 110 45) or a single hyphenated range (e.g. 100-200).
              Note that range and list don't work together. Deletes search
              results when combined with search options, if no arguments.

       --retain-order
              When deleting bookmarks, shift indices of multiple records
              instead of replacing the deleted record with the last one.

       -v --version
              Show program version and exit.

       -h --help
              Show program help and exit.

EDIT OPTIONS
       --url [...]
              Specify the URL, works with --update only. Fetches and updates
              title if --title is not used.

       --tag [+|-] [...]
              Specify comma separated tags, works with --add, --update. Clears
              the tags, if no arguments passed. Appends or deletes tags, if
              list of tags is preceded by '+' or '-' respectively.

       --title [...]
              Manually specify the title, works with --add, --update. Omits or
              clears the title, if no arguments passed.

       -c --comment [...]
              Add notes or description of the bookmark, works with --add,
              --update. Clears the comment, if no arguments passed.

       --immutable N
              Set the title, description and tags of a bookmark immutable
              during autorefresh. Works with --add, --update. N=1 sets the
              immutable flag, N=0 removes it. If omitted, bookmarks are added
              with N=0.

       --swap N M
              Swap two records at specified indices. This is a standalone
              operation (cannot be invoked along with any other).

SEARCH OPTIONS
       -s --sany keyword [...]
              Search bookmarks with ANY of the keyword(s) in URL, title or
              tags and show the results. Prompts to enter result number to
              open in browser. Note that the sequential result index is not
              the DB index. The DB index is shown within '[]' after the title.
              This is the default search option for positional arguments if no
              other search option is specified.

       -S --sall keyword [...]
              Search bookmarks with ALL keywords in URL, title or tags and
              show the results. Behaviour same as --sany.
              Special keywords:
              "blank": list entries with empty title/tag
              "immutable": list entries with locked title
              NOTE: To search the keywords, use --sany

       --deep Search modifier to match substrings. Works with --sany, --sall.

       --markers
              Search modifier to match specific fields based on (optional)
              prefix markers (i.e. beginning of the keyword):
                - '.' : search in title
                - '>' : search in description
                - ':' : search in URL
                - '#' : search in tags (comma-separated, partial matches; not
              affected by --deep)
                - '#,' : search in tags (comma-separated, exact matches; not
              affected by --deep)
                - '*' : search in all fields (same as no prefix)

       -r --sreg expression
              Scan for a regular expression match.

       -t --stag [tag [,|+] ...] [- tag, ...]
              Search bookmarks by tags.
              Use ',' delimiter to find entries matching ANY of the tags
              Use ' + ' delimiter to find entries matching ALL of the tags.
              (Note that the ' + ' delimiter must be space separated)
              NOTE: Cannot combine ',' and '+' in the same search
              Use ' - ' to exclude bookmarks that match the tags that follow.
              (Note that the '-' operator must be space separated).
              List all tags alphabetically, if no arguments. The usage count
              (number of bookmarks having the tag) is shown within first
              brackets.

       -x --exclude keyword [...]
              Exclude bookmarks matching the specified keywords. Works with
              --sany, --sall, --sreg and --stag.

       --random [N]
              Output random bookmarks out of the selection (1 unless amount is
              specified).

       --order fields [...]
              Order printed/exported records by the given fields (from DB or
              JSON) and/or netloc. You can specify sort direction for each by
              prepending '+'/'-' (default is '+').

ENCRYPTION OPTIONS
       -l --lock [N]
              Encrypt (lock) the DB file with N (> 0, default 8) hash passes
              to generate key.

       -k --unlock [N]
              Decrypt (unlock) the DB file with N (> 0, default 8) hash passes
              to generate key.

POWER OPTIONS
       --ai   Auto-import bookmarks from Firefox, Google Chrome, Chromium,
              Vivaldi, and Edge browsers. (Firefox profile can be specified
              using environment variable FIREFOX_PROFILE.)

       -e --export file
              Export bookmarks to Firefox bookmarks formatted HTML. Works with
              all search options.
              XBEL is used if file has extension '.xbel'.
              Markdown is used if file has extension '.md'. Markdown format:
              [title](url), 1 entry per line.
              Orgfile is used if file has extension '.org' Orgfile format: *
              [[url][title]], 1 entry per line.
              RSS is used if file has extension '.rss'/'.atom' RSS format:
              <entry> per bookmark with <title>, <link>, <category>, <content>
              elements
              A buku database is generated if file has extension '.db'.

       -i --import file
              Import bookmarks from Firefox bookmarks formatted HTML.  file is
              considered Firefox-exported JSON if it has '.json' extension,
              XBEL if it is '.xbel', Markdown (compliant with --export format)
              if it is '.md', Orgfile if the extension is '.org', RSS if the
              extension is '.rss'/'.atom' or another buku database if the
              extension is '.db'.

       -p --print [...]
              Show details (DB index, URL, title, tags and comment) of
              bookmark record by DB index. If no arguments, all records with
              actual index from DB are shown. Accepts hyphenated ranges and
              space-separated indices. A negative value (introduced for
              convenience) behaves like the tail utility, e.g., -n shows the
              details of the last n bookmarks.

       -f --format N
              Show selective monochrome output with specific fields. Works
              with --print. Search results honour the option when used along
              with --json. Useful for creating batch scripts.
              N = 1, show only URL.
              N = 2, show URL and tags in a single line.
              N = 3, show only title.
              N = 4, show URL, title and tags in a single line.
              N = 5, show title and tags in a single line.
              To omit DB index from printed results, use N0, e.g., 10, 20, 30,
              40, 50.

       -j --json
              Output data formatted as JSON, works with --print output and
              search results.

       --colors COLORS
              Set output colors. Refer to the COLORS section below for
              details.

       --nc   Disable color output in all messages. Useful on terminals which
              can't handle ANSI color codes or scripted environments.

       -n --count N
              Number of results to show per page (default 10).

       --np   Do not show the prompt, run and exit.

       -o --open [...]
              Open bookmarks by DB indices or ranges in browser. Open a random
              index if argument is omitted.

       --oa   Open all search results immediately in the browser. Works best
              with --np. When used along with --update or --delete, URLs are
              opened in the browser first and then modified or deleted.

       --replace old new
              Replace old tag with new tag if both are passed; delete old tag
              if new tag is not specified.

       --url-redirect
              when fetching an URL, use the resulting URL from following
              permanent redirects (when combined with --export, the old URL is
              included as additional metadata).

       --tag-redirect [tag]
              when fetching an URL that causes permanent redirect, add a tag

       --export-on [...]
              export records affected by the above options, including removed
              info (requires --update and --export; specific HTTP response

COLORS
       buku allows you to customize the color scheme via a five-letter string,
       reminiscent of BSD LSCOLORS. The five letters represent the colors of

       - index
       - title
       - URL
       - description/comment/note
       - tag

       respectively. The five-letter string is passed is as the argument to
       the --colors option, or as the value of the environment variable
       BUKU_COLORS.
       We offer the following colors/styles:

         ┌───────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

       The default colors string is oKlxm, which stands for

       - bright cyan index
       - bold bright green title
       - bright yellow URL
       - normal description
       - bright blue tag

       Note that

       - Bright colors (implemented as \x1b[90m - \x1b[97m) may not be
         available in all color-capable terminal emulators;

       - Some terminal emulators draw bold text in bright colors instead;

       - Some terminal emulators only distinguish between bold and bright
         colors via a default-off switch.

       Please consult the manual of your terminal emulator as well as
       https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code for details.


EXAMPLES
       1.  Edit and add a bookmark from editor:


              buku -w
              buku -w 'gedit -w'
              buku -w 'macvim -f' -a https://ddg.gg search engine, privacy


           The first command picks editor from the environment variable
           EDITOR. The second command opens gedit in blocking mode. The third
           command opens macvim with option -f and the URL and tags populated
           in template.

       2.  Add a simple bookmark:


              buku --nostdin -a https://github.com/


           In the output, >: url, +: comment, #: tags.

       3.  Add a bookmark with tags 'search engine' and 'privacy', comment
           'Search engine with perks', fetch page title from the web:


              buku -a https://ddg.gg search engine, privacy -c Search engine with perks


           In the output, >: url, +: comment, #: tags.

       4.  Add a bookmark with tags 'search engine' & 'privacy' and immutable
           custom title 'DDG':


              buku -a https://ddg.gg search engine, privacy --title 'DDG' --immutable 1


           Note that URL must precede tags.

       5.  Add a bookmark without a title (works for update too):


              buku -a https://ddg.gg search engine, privacy --title

       6.  Edit and update a bookmark from editor:


              buku -w 15012014


           This will open the existing bookmark's details in the editor for
           modifications. Environment variable EDITOR must be set.

       7.  Update existing bookmark at index 15012014 with new URL, tags and
           comments, fetch title from the web:


              buku -u 15012014 --url http://ddg.gg/ --tag web search, utilities -c Private search engine

       8.  Fetch and update only title for bookmark at 15012014:


              buku -u 15012014

       9.  Update only comment for bookmark at 15012014:


              buku -u 15012014 -c this is a new comment


           Applies to --url, --title and --tag too.

       10. Export bookmarks tagged 'tag 1' or 'tag 2' to HTML, XBEL, Markdown,
           Orgfile or a new database:


              buku -e bookmarks.html --stag tag 1, tag 2
              buku -e bookmarks.xbel --stag tag 1, tag 2
              buku -e bookmarks.md --stag tag 1, tag 2
              buku -e bookmarks.org --stag tag 1, tag 2
              buku -e bookmarks.db --stag tag 1, tag 2


           All bookmarks are exported if search is not opted.

       11. Import bookmarks from HTML, XBEL, Markdown or Orgfile:


              buku -i bookmarks.html
              buku -i bookmarks.xbel
              buku -i bookmarks.md
              buku -i bookmarks.db

       12. Delete only comment for bookmark at 15012014:


              buku -u 15012014 -c


           Applies to --title and --tag too. URL cannot be deleted without
           deleting the bookmark.

       13. Update or refresh full DB with page titles from the web:


              buku -u
              buku -u --tacit (show only failures and exceptions)


           This operation can update the title or description fields of non-
           immutable bookmarks by parsing the fetched page. Fields are updated
           only if the fetched fields are non-empty. Tags remain untouched.

       14. Delete bookmark at index 15012014:


              buku -d 15012014


           The last index is moved to the deleted index to keep the DB
           compact. Add --tacit to delete without confirmation.

       15. Delete all bookmarks:


              buku -d

       16. Delete a range or list of bookmarks:


              buku -d 100-200
              buku -d 100 15 200

       17. Search bookmarks for ANY of the keywords 'kernel' and 'debugging'

       18. Search bookmarks with ALL the keywords 'kernel' and 'debugging' in
           URL, title or tags:


              buku -S kernel debugging

       19. Search bookmarks tagged 'general kernel concepts':


              buku --stag general kernel concepts

       20. Search for bookmarks matching ANY of the tags 'kernel',
           'debugging', 'general kernel concepts':


              buku --stag kernel, debugging, general kernel concepts

       21. Search for bookmarks matching ALL of the tags 'kernel',
           'debugging', 'general kernel concepts':


              buku --stag kernel + debugging + general kernel concepts

       22. Search for bookmarks matching any of the keywords 'hello' or
           'world', excluding the keywords 'real' and 'life', matching both
           the tags 'kernel' and 'debugging', but excluding the tags 'general
           kernel concepts' and 'books':


              buku hello world --exclude real life --stag 'kernel + debugging - general kernel concepts, books'

       23. Search for bookmarks with different tokens for each field, and
           print them out sorted by the tags (ascending) and URL (descending)


              buku --order +tags,-url --markers --sall 'global substring' '.title substring' ':url substring' :https '> description substring' '#partial,tags:' '#,exact,tags' '*another global substring'

       24. List all unique tags alphabetically:


              buku --stag

       25. Run a search and update the results:


              buku -s kernel debugging -u --tag + linux kernel

       26. Run a search and delete the results:


              buku -s kernel debugging -d

       27. Encrypt or decrypt DB with custom number of iterations (15) to
           generate key:


              buku -l 15
              buku -k 15


           The same number of iterations must be specified for one lock &
           unlock instance. Default is 8, if omitted.
