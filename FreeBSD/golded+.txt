GOLDED(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              GOLDED(1)

NAME
       golded - offline message reader for Fidonet and Usenet

SYNOPSIS
       golded [-options] [keystacking]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the command line parameters of
       GoldEd+ (binary file golded).

OPTIONS
       All options is case-insensitive.

       -? or -H
              Displays a help screen with all available commandline options.

       -C<configfile>
              Specifies another configuration file than the default
              GOLDED.CFG.

       -D     Disable old configuration keywords. For backward compatibility,
              GoldED+ still supports a number of old names for some
              configuration keywords. I recommend that you use -D sometimes
              and rename the keywords that are reported as unknown.

       -E<echoid>
              If specified, GoldED+ starts directly in the specified echo,
              bypassing the arealist screen. See the AREASTART configuration
              keyword for more info.

       -EXPORTSOUP
              Calls the SOUP packet export feature during the startup phase.
              This is the same as starting it from the areascan SOUP
              Packet->Export menu item. The SOUP export happens immediately
              after the regular startup area scanning (if that is enabled) and
              after SOUP import.

       -F     Force recompile of most configuration files, but not all. Does
              not recompile the *.CHS files.

       -FF    Force complete recompile of all configuration files, regardless
              of whether they are up-to-date or not. This is equivalent to
              deleting all the *.GE?  files.

       -INSTALL[=path]
              Start the quick install procedure. You should give a path to
              your other mail software if it cannot be found using environment
              variables or in current directory.

       -IMPORTSOUP
              Calls the SOUP packet import feature during the startup phase.
              This is the same as starting it from the areascan SOUP
              Packet->Import menu item. The SOUP import happens immediately
              after the regular startup area scanning (if that is enabled).

       -M     Mute sounds. Disables all noises in GoldED+.

       -N     No share. If used, this prevents GoldED+ from using SHARE
              compatible file-open calls, which are used by default. Works
              only until the SHAREMODE keyword is used in GOLDED.CFG. This
              keyword is normally not useful, but may be used to debug your
              setup or something.

       -NOSCAN
              Disable the automatic startup area scanning (if that is
              enabled). This is useful for automated SOUP import/export in a
              batch file. For example, -noscan -importsoup @x y imports SOUP
              then exits.

       -Q     Quiet. Turns off verbose config compile. On by default. This
              could be used on the commandline to disable a -B -V option in
              the GEDCMD environment variable.

       -S<sortspec>
              Sort all areas according to -IR <sortspec> .  See the
              AREALISTSORT config keyword for details.

       -T<seconds>
              Set the timeout value. A value of zero (0) means never timeout.
              See the TIMEOUT config keyword for details.

       -V     Turns on verbose config compile. When used, GoldED+ will display
              the full filename of each main config file it compiles. It also
              displays the name of the detected multitasker, if any. This can
              be useful for debugging your setup, and see if GoldED+ accesses
              the files (especially the AREAFILE's) it is supposed to.  -VV
              Same as -V, but also displays all the active lines while
              compiling. This could be used to find the exact spot if it
              crashes or stops while compiling.

       -W     If used, GoldED+ will create (and overwrite if existing) the
              file GOLDAREA.INC, which will then contain all areas in the
              AREADEF form, sorted by your AREALISTSORT specification. This is
              very useful for converting your AREAFILE's to a form you can
              edit with your favorite text editor and use in GoldED+. It is
              also useful if you have used the new AREADESC keyword or the
              AREAFILE EchoList reader. The GOLDAREA.INC file (created in the
              GOLDPATH) can be used by adding INCLUDE GOLDAREA.INC to your
              GOLDED.CFG or GOLDAREA.CFG. When creating the file, GoldED+ will
              use . if an aka is the same as the main aka, and leave out the
              optional origin if it's the same as the first ORIGIN in your
              GOLDED.CFG. This makes it easier to share the same GOLDAREA.INC
              between different setups.

       -X, -Y, -Z
              Reserved for debugging purposes.

COMMANDLINE KEYSTACKING
       Any non-option characters on the commandline are stuffed into the
       keyboard buffer. See the chapter on keyboard definition and the
       KEYBSTACK keyword for more info.

ENVIRONMENT
       GOLDED Path to the GOLDED.CFG file. It is recommended to set this
              variable, but don't forget to change it if you move your GoldED+
              setup to a different directory!

       GEDCMD Specifies additional commandline options. Use this if you want
              to specify options, but need to run GoldED without them (for
              example when renaming GOLDED.EXE to DBEDIT.EXE in older versions
              of D'Bridge). You can override the environment options with
              commandline options.
