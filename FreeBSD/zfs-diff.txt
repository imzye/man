NAME
     zfs-diff – show difference between ZFS snapshots

SYNOPSIS
     zfs diff [-FHt] snapshot snapshot|filesystem

DESCRIPTION
     Display the difference between a snapshot of a given filesystem and
     another snapshot of that filesystem from a later time or the current
     contents of the filesystem.  The first column is a character indicating
     the type of change, the other columns indicate pathname, new pathname (in
     case of rename), change in link count, and optionally file type and/or
     change time.  The types of change are:
           -  The path has been removed
           +  The path has been created
           M  The path has been modified
           R  The path has been renamed

     -F  Display an indication of the type of file, in a manner similar to the
         -F option of ls(1).
           B  Block device
           C  Character device
           /  Directory
           >  Door
           |  Named pipe
           @  Symbolic link
           P  Event port
           =  Socket
           F  Regular file

     -H  Give more parsable tab-separated output, without header lines and
         without arrows.

     -t  Display the path's inode change time as the first column of output.
