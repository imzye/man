NAME
     faup – Finally An Url Parser!

SYNOPSIS
     faup [-ablptu] [-d delim]
          [-f scheme | credential | subdomain | domain |
          domain_without_tld |
          host | tld | port | resource_path | query_string | fragment]
          [-m module1 module2 ...] [-o csv | json | module] [-r count]
          [-w ip:port] ⟨url | file⟩

DESCRIPTION
     Everytime faup is called with an url or a file containing a list of URLs,
     it will split the various parts of it.

     faup is designed to be really fast to do that operation, much faster than
     a regex, and give you much more features. The problem is harder than what
     it first appears. If you want to get fields like subdomains from an URL,
     you will need to extract the TLD properly. And since extracting the TLD
     properly is impossible with a regex, you will be stuck.

     The following options are available:

     -a      skip provided argument file open check

     -b      Run the webserver in background

     -d delim
             Use delim as the field delimiter character instead of the comma
             character.

     -f field
             Extract only the wanted field which can be one of the following:
             scheme, credential, subdomain, domain, domain_without_tld, host,
             tld, port, resource_path, query_string, fragment

     -l      Prefix each line with the line number. Works only if the output
             is CSV.

     -m module1 module2 ..
             Load the modules in the wanted order. If the list is empty, faup
             will run without any module.

     -o format
             Output in the wanted format which can be one of the following:
             csv, json, module

     -p      print the header (applies to CSV only)

     -r count
             Remove the count number of characters from the end. Useful to
             remove the dot in DNS urls given.

     -t      do not extract TLD > 1 (eg. only get 'uk' instead of 'co.uk')

     -u      Update the TLD suffix list

     -w ip:port
             Start faup in webserver mode


EXIT STATUS
     The faup utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.


EXAMPLES
     Extract the TLD from slashdot.org:

           faup -f tld www.slashdot.org

     Run faup in webserver mode in background:

           faup -b -w 0.0.0.0:9876

     List all the available modules:

           faup $ modules list all

     Enable the uppercase lua module:

           faup $ modules enable uppercase.lua

     Output the wanted url in json

           faup -o json http://www.example.co.uk:1234/foo.html#bar

ENVIRONMENT
     The following environment variable affects the exectution of faup :

     FAUP_DATA_DIR   If the environment variable FAUP_DATA_DIR is set, tell
                     faup where to find its datadir, to get modules or the tld
                     prefix list ('mozilla.tlds')
