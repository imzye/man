NAME
        bregex - Bareos's 'regex' engine

SYNOPSIS
       bregex [options] -f <data-file>

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the bregex command.
       This program can be useful for testing regex expressions to be applied
       against a list of filenames.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       -?     Show version and usage of program.

       -d nn  Set debug level to nn.

       -dt    Print timestamp in debug output

       -f <data-file>
              The data-file is a filename that contains lines of data to be
              matched (or not) against one or more patterns. When the program
              is run, it will prompt you for a regular expression pattern,
              then apply it one line at a time against the data in the file.
              Each line that matches will be printed preceded by its line
              number.  You will then be prompted again for another pattern.

       -n     Print lines that do not match

       -l     Suppress lines numbers.
