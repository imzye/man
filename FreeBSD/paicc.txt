 paicc(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual               paicc(1)

NAME
       paint_changed_characters,  paicc

SYNOPSIS
       paicc [ -h -c -mui -t -csae]

DESCRIPTION
       This command turns the static output from one or more Unix commands
       into a dynamic, pageable, real-time display.  You specify the
       command(s) and the delay period between screen refreshes and Paint
       Changed Characters does the rest, including optimizations to minimize
       cursor movement and the number of transmitted characters.  (Patterned
       after the CYBIL version for NOS/VE.)

       The environment variable SHELL determines which shell will execute the
       command(s).  If it is not defined /bin/sh is assumed.

       The environment variable D_PAICC_C can be defined to change the default
       command "ps -el".

         Example:

           paicc   # execute ps -el every second,
                   # (or the default command)

           paicc -c "hostname>o;ps -ef>>o;cat o" -mui 3000
                   # execute ps -ef every 3 seconds
                   # with hostname on first line


OPTIONS
       -help, h, usage_help, full_help: Display Command Information


         Display information about this command, which includes
         a command description with examples, plus a synopsis of
         the command line parameters.  If you specify -full_help
         rather than -help complete parameter help is displayed
         if it's available.


       -command, c: string = D_PAICC_C, "ps -el"


         Specifies the command to periodically execute.  You can
         change the default value "ps -el" by defining the
         environment variable D_PAICC_C.


       -millisecond_update_interval, mui: integer = D_PAICC_MUI, 1000


         Specifies the number of milliseconds between command
         executions.  1000 milliseconds = 1 second.  You can
         change the default value by defining D_PAICC_MUI.


       -title, t: boolean = D_PAICC_T, TRUE


         Specifies whether to display the paint_changed_characters
         title line.  Define D_PAICC_T to change the default.


       -clear_screen_at_end, csae: boolean = D_PAICC_CSAE, TRUE


         Specifies whether or not a final 'screen erase' is done
         when you exit paint_changed_characters.  Remember, if you
         don't like the default value, define the environment
         variable D_PAICC_CSAE=NO.
