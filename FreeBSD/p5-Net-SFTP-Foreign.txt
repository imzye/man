NAME
       Net::SFTP::Foreign - SSH File Transfer Protocol client

SYNOPSIS
           use Net::SFTP::Foreign;
           my $sftp = Net::SFTP::Foreign->new($host);
           $sftp->die_on_error("Unable to establish SFTP connection");

           $sftp->setcwd($path) or die "unable to change cwd: " . $sftp->error;

           $sftp->get("foo", "bar") or die "get failed: " . $sftp->error;

           $sftp->put("bar", "baz") or die "put failed: " . $sftp->error;

DESCRIPTION
       SFTP stands for SSH File Transfer Protocol and is a method of
       transferring files between machines over a secure, encrypted connection
       (as opposed to regular FTP, which functions over an insecure
       connection). The security in SFTP comes through its integration with
       SSH, which provides an encrypted transport layer over which the SFTP
       commands are executed.

       Net::SFTP::Foreign is a Perl client for the SFTP version 3 as defined
       in the SSH File Transfer Protocol IETF draft, which can be found at
       <http://www.openssh.org/txt/draft-ietf-secsh-filexfer-02.txt> (also
       included on this package distribution, on the "rfc" directory).

       Net::SFTP::Foreign uses any compatible "ssh" command installed on the
       system (for instance, OpenSSH "ssh") to establish the secure connection
       to the remote server.

       A wrapper module Net::SFTP::Foreign::Compat is also provided for
       compatibility with Net::SFTP.

   Net::SFTP::Foreign Vs. Net::SFTP Vs. Net::SSH2::SFTP
       Why should I prefer Net::SFTP::Foreign over Net::SFTP?

       Well, both modules have their pros and cons:

       Net::SFTP::Foreign does not require a bunch of additional modules and
       external libraries to work, just the OpenBSD SSH client (or any other
       client compatible enough).

       I trust OpenSSH SSH client more than Net::SSH::Perl, there are lots of
       paranoid people ensuring that OpenSSH doesn't have security holes!!!

       If you have an SSH infrastructure already deployed, by using the same
       binary SSH client, Net::SFTP::Foreign ensures a seamless integration
       within your environment (configuration files, keys, etc.).

       Net::SFTP::Foreign is much faster transferring files, specially over
       networks with high (relative) latency.

       Net::SFTP::Foreign provides several high level methods not available
       from Net::SFTP as for instance "find", "glob", "rget", "rput",
       "rremove", "mget", "mput".

       On the other hand, using the external command means an additional
       process being launched and running, depending on your OS this could eat
       more resources than the in process pure perl implementation provided by
       Net::SSH::Perl.

       Net::SSH2 is a module wrapping libssh2, an SSH version 2 client library
       written in C. It is a very active project that aims to replace
       Net::SSH::Perl. Unfortunately, libssh2 SFTP functionality (available in
       Perl via Net::SSH2::SFTP) is rather limited and its performance very
       poor.

       Later versions of Net::SFTP::Foreign can use Net::SSH2 as the transport
       layer via the backend module Net::SFTP::Foreign::Backend::Net_SSH2.

   Error handling
       The method "$sftp->error" can be used to check for errors after every
       method call. For instance:

         $sftp = Net::SFTP::Foreign->new($host);
         $sftp->error and die "unable to connect to remote host: " . $sftp->error;

       Also, the "die_on_error" method provides a handy shortcut for the last
       line:

         $sftp = Net::SFTP::Foreign->new($host);
         $sftp->die_on_error("unable to connect to remote host");

       The "status" method can also be used to get the value for the last SFTP
       status response, but that is only useful when calling low level methods
       mapping to single SFTP primitives. In any case, it should be considered
       an implementation detail of the module usable only for troubleshooting
       and error reporting.

   autodie mode
       When the "autodie" mode is set at construction time, non-recoverable
       errors are automatically promoted to exceptions. For instance:

         $sftp = Net::SFTP::Foreign->new($host, autodie => 1);
         my $ls = $sftp->ls("/bar");
         # dies as: "Couldn't open remote dir '/bar': No such file"

       Error handling in non-recursive methods

       Most of the non-recursive methods available from this package return
       undef on failure and a true value or the requested data on success.

       For instance:

         $sftp->get($from, $to) or die "get failed!";

       Error handling in recursive methods

       Recursive methods (i.e. "find", "rget", "rput", "rremove") do not stop
       on errors but just skip the affected files and directories and keep
       going.

       After a call to a recursive method, the error indicator is only set
       when an unrecoverable error is found (i.e. a connection lost). For
       instance, this code doesn't work as expected:

         $sftp->rremove($dir);
         $sftp->error and die "rremove failed"; # this is wrong!!!

       This does:

         my $errors;
         $sftp->rremove($dir, on_error => sub { $errors++});
         $errors and die "rremove failed";

       The "autodie" mode is disabled when an "on_error" handler is passed to
       methods accepting it:

         my $sftp = Net::SFTP::Foreign->new($host, autodie => 1);
         # prints "foo!" and does not die:
         $sftp->find("/sdfjkalshfl", # nonexistent directory
                     on_error => sub { print "foo!\n" });
         # dies:
         $sftp->find("/sdfjkalshfl");

   API
       The methods available from this module are described below.

       Don't forget to read also the FAQ and BUGS sections at the end of this
       document!

       Net::SFTP::Foreign->new($host, %args)
       Net::SFTP::Foreign->new(%args)
           Opens a new SFTP connection with a remote host $host, and returns a
           Net::SFTP::Foreign object representing that open connection.

           An explicit check for errors should be included always after the
           constructor call:

             my $sftp = Net::SFTP::Foreign->new(...);
             $sftp->die_on_error("SSH connection failed");

           The optional arguments accepted are as follows:

           host => $hostname
               remote host name

           user => $username
               username to log in to the remote server. This should be your
               SSH login, and can be empty, in which case the username is
               drawn from the user executing the process.

           port => $portnumber
               port number where the remote SSH server is listening

           ssh1 => 1
               use old SSH1 approach for starting the remote SFTP server.

           more => [@more_ssh_args]
               additional args passed to "ssh" command.

               For debugging purposes you can run "ssh" in verbose mode
               passing it the "-v" option:

                 my $sftp = Net::SFTP::Foreign->new($host, more => '-v');

               Note that this option expects a single command argument or a
               reference to an array of arguments. For instance:

                 more => '-v'         # right
                 more => ['-v']       # right
                 more => "-c $cipher"    # wrong!!!
                 more => [-c => $cipher] # right

           timeout => $seconds
               when this parameter is set, the connection is dropped if no
               data arrives on the SSH socket for the given time while waiting
               for some command to complete.

               When the timeout expires, the current method is aborted and the
               SFTP connection becomes invalid.

               Note that the given value is used internally to time out low
               level operations. The high level operations available through
               the API may take longer to expire (sometimes up to 4 times
               longer).

               The "Windows" backend used by default when the operating system
               is MS Windows (though, not under Cygwin perl), does not support
               timeouts. To overcome this limitation you can switch to the
               "Net_SSH2" backend or use Net::SSH::Any that provides its own
               backend supporting timeouts.

           fs_encoding => $encoding
               Version 3 of the SFTP protocol (the one supported by this
               module) knows nothing about the character encoding used on the
               remote filesystem to represent file and directory names.

               This option allows one to select the encoding used in the
               remote machine. The default value is "utf8".

               For instance:

                 $sftp = Net::SFTP::Foreign->new('user@host', fs_encoding => 'latin1');

               will convert any path name passed to any method in this package
               to its "latin1" representation before sending it to the remote
               side.

               Note that this option will not affect file contents in any way.

               This feature is not supported in perl 5.6 due to incomplete
               Unicode support in the interpreter.

           key_path => $filename
           key_path => \@filenames
               asks "ssh" to use the key(s) in the given file(s) for
               authentication.

           password => $password
               Logs into the remote host using password authentication with
               the given password.

               Password authentication is only available if the module IO::Pty
               is installed. Note also, that on Windows this module is only
               available when running the Cygwin port of Perl.

           asks_for_username_at_login => 0|'auto'|1
               During the interactive authentication dialog, most SSH servers
               only ask for the user password as the login name is passed
               inside the SSH protocol. But under some uncommon servers or
               configurations it is possible that a username is also
               requested.

               When this flag is set to 1, the username will be send
               unconditionally at the first remote prompt and then the
               password at the second.

               When it is set to "auto" the module will use some heuristics in
               order to determine if it is being asked for an username.

               When set to 0, the username will never be sent during the
               authentication dialog. This is the default.

           password_prompt => $regex_or_str
               The module expects the password prompt from the remote server
               to end in a colon or a question mark. This seems to cover
               correctly 99% of real life cases.

               Otherwise this option can be used to handle the exceptional
               cases. For instance:

                 $sftp = Net::SFTP::Foreign->new($host, password => $password,
                                                 password_prompt => qr/\bpassword>\s*$/);

               Note that your script will hang at the login phase if the wrong
               prompt is used.

           passphrase => $passphrase
               Logs into the remote server using a passphrase protected
               private key.

               Requires also the module IO::Pty.

           expect_log_user => $bool
               This feature is obsolete as Expect is not used anymore to
               handle password authentication.

           ssh_cmd => $sshcmd
           ssh_cmd => \@sshcmd
               name of the external SSH client. By default "ssh" is used.

               For instance:

                 $sftp = Net::SFTP::Foreign->new($host, ssh_cmd => 'plink');

               When an array reference is used, its elements are inserted at
               the beginning of the system call. That allows one, for
               instance, to connect to the target host through some SSH proxy:

                 $sftp = Net::SFTP::Foreign->new($host,
                             ssh_cmd => [qw(ssh -l user proxy.server ssh)]);

               But note that the module will not handle password
               authentication for those proxies.

           ssh_cmd_interface => 'plink' or 'ssh' or 'tectia'
               declares the command line interface that the SSH client used to
               connect to the remote host understands. Currently "plink",
               "ssh" and "tectia" are supported.

               This option would be rarely required as the module infers the
               interface from the SSH command name.

           transport => $fh
           transport => [$in_fh, $out_fh]
           transport => [$in_fh, $out_fh, $pid]
               allows one to use an already open pipe or socket as the
               transport for the SFTP protocol.

               It can be (ab)used to make this module work with password
               authentication or with keys requiring a passphrase.

               "in_fh" is the file handler used to read data from the remote
               server, "out_fh" is the file handler used to write data.

               On some systems, when using a pipe as the transport, closing
               it, does not cause the process at the other side to exit. The
               additional $pid argument can be used to instruct this module to
               kill that process if it doesn't exit by itself.

           open2_cmd => [@cmd]
           open2_cmd => $cmd;
               allows one to completely redefine how "ssh" is called. Its
               arguments are passed to IPC::Open2::open2 to open a pipe to the
               remote server.

           stderr_fh => $fh
               redirects the output sent to stderr by the SSH subprocess to
               the given file handle.

               It can be used to suppress banners:

                 open my $ssherr, '>', '/dev/null' or die "unable to open /dev/null";
                 my $sftp = Net::SFTP::Foreign->new($host,
                                                    stderr_fh => $ssherr);

               Or to send SSH stderr to a file in order to capture errors for
               later analysis:

                 my $ssherr = File::Temp->new or die "File::Temp->new failed";
                 my $sftp = Net::SFTP::Foreign->new($hostname, more => ['-v'],
                                                    stderr_fh => $ssherr);
                 if ($sftp->error) {
                   print "sftp error: ".$sftp->error."\n";
                   seek($ssherr, 0, 0);
                   while (<$ssherr>) {
                     print "captured stderr: $_";
                   }
                 }

           stderr_discard => 1
               redirects stderr to /dev/null

           block_size => $default_block_size
           queue_size => $default_queue_size
               default "block_size" and "queue_size" used for read and write
               operations (see the "put" or "get" documentation).

           autoflush => $bool
               by default, and for performance reasons, write operations are
               cached, and only when the write buffer becomes big enough is
               the data written to the remote file. Setting this flag makes
               the write operations immediate.

           write_delay => $bytes
               This option determines how many bytes are buffered before the
               real SFTP write operation is performed.

           read_ahead => $bytes
               On read operations this option determines how many bytes to
               read in advance so that later read operations can be fulfilled
               from the buffer.

               Using a high value will increase the performance of the module
               for a sequential reads access pattern but degrade it for a
               short random reads access pattern. It can also cause
               synchronization problems if the file is concurrently modified
               by other parties ("flush" can be used to discard all the data
               inside the read buffer on demand).

               The default value is set dynamically considering some runtime
               parameters and given options, though it tends to favor the
               sequential read access pattern.

           autodisconnect => $ad
               by default, the SSH connection is closed from the DESTROY
               method when the object goes out of scope on the process and
               thread where it was created. This option allows one to
               customize this behaviour.

               The acceptable values for $ad are:

               '0' Never try to disconnect this object when exiting from any
                   process.

                   On most operating systems, the SSH process will exit when
                   the last process connected to it ends, but this is not
                   guaranteed.

                   You can always call the "disconnect" method explicitly to
                   end the connection at the right time from the right place.

               '1' Disconnect on exit from any thread or process.

               '2' Disconnect on exit from the current process/thread only.
                   This is the default.

               See also the "disconnect" and "autodisconnect" methods.

           late_set_perm => $bool
               See the FAQ below.

           dirty_cleanup => $bool
               Sets the "dirty_cleanup" flag in a per object basis (see the
               BUGS section).

           backend => $backend
               From version 1.57 Net::SFTP::Foreign supports plugable backends
               in order to allow other ways to communicate with the remote
               server in addition to the default pipe-to-ssh-process.

               Custom backends may change the set of options supported by the
               "new" method.

           autodie => $bool
               Enables the autodie mode that will cause the module to die when
               any error is found (a la autodie).

       $sftp->error
           Returns the error code from the last executed command. The value
           returned is similar to $!, when used as a string it yields the
           corresponding error string.

           See Net::SFTP::Foreign::Constants for a list of possible error
           codes and how to import them on your scripts.

       $sftp->die_on_error($msg)
           Convenience method:

             $sftp->die_on_error("Something bad happened");
             # is a shortcut for...
             $sftp->error and die "Something bad happened: " . $sftp->error;

       $sftp->status
           Returns the code from the last SSH2_FXP_STATUS response. It is also
           a dualvar that yields the status string when used as a string.

           Usually "$sftp->error" should be checked first to see if there was
           any error and then "$sftp->status" to find out its low level cause.

       $sftp->cwd
           Returns the remote current working directory.

           When a relative remote path is passed to any of the methods on this
           package, this directory is used to compose the absolute path.

       $sftp->setcwd($dir, %opts)
           Changes the remote current working directory. The remote directory
           should exist, otherwise the call fails.

           Returns the new remote current working directory or undef on
           failure.

           Passing "undef" as the $dir argument resets the cwd to the server
           default which is usually the user home but not always.

           The method accepts the following options:

           check => 0
               By default the given target directory is checked against the
               remote server to ensure that it actually exists and that it is
               a directory. Some servers may fail to honor those requests even
               for valid directories (i.e. when the directory has the hidden
               flag set).

               This option allows one to disable those checks and just sets
               the cwd to the given value blindly.

       $sftp->get($remote, $local, %options)
           Copies remote file $remote to local $local. By default file
           attributes are also copied (permissions, atime and mtime). For
           instance:

             $sftp->get('/var/log/messages', '/tmp/messages')
               or die "file transfer failed: " . $sftp->error;

           A file handle can also be used as the local target. In that case,
           the remote file contents are retrieved and written to the given
           file handle. Note also that the handle is not closed when the
           transmission finish.

             open F, '| gzip -c > /tmp/foo' or die ...;
             $sftp->get("/etc/passwd", \*F)
               or die "get failed: " . $sftp->error;
             close F or die ...;

           Accepted options (not all combinations are possible):

           copy_time => $bool
               determines if access and modification time attributes have to
               be copied from remote file. Default is to copy them.

           copy_perm => $bool
               determines if permission attributes have to be copied from
               remote file. Default is to copy them after applying the local
               process umask.

           umask => $umask
               allows one to select the umask to apply when setting the
               permissions of the copied file. Default is to use the umask for
               the current process or 0 if the "perm" option is also used.

           perm => $perm
               sets the permission mask of the file to be $perm, remote
               permissions are ignored.

           resume => 1 | 'auto'
               resumes an interrupted transfer.

               If the "auto" value is given, the transfer will be resumed only
               when the local file is newer than the remote one.

               "get" transfers can not be resumed when a data conversion is in
               place.

           append => 1
               appends the contents of the remote file at the end of the local
               one instead of overwriting it. If the local file does not exist
               a new one is created.

           overwrite => 0
               setting this option to zero cancels the transfer when a local
               file of the same name already exists.

           numbered => 1
               modifies the local file name inserting a sequence number when
               required in order to avoid overwriting local files.

               For instance:

                 for (1..2) {
                   $sftp->get("data.txt", "data.txt", numbered => 1);
                 }

               will copy the remote file as "data.txt" the first time and as
               "data(1).txt" the second one.

               If a scalar reference is passed as the numbered value, the
               final target will be stored in the value pointed by the
               reference. For instance:

                 my $target;
                 $sftp->get("data.txt", "data.txt", numbered => \$target);
                 say "file was saved as $target" unless $sftp->error

           atomic => 1
               The remote file contents are transferred into a temporal file
               that once the copy completes is renamed to the target
               destination.

               If not-overwrite of remote files is also requested, an empty
               file may appear at the target destination before the rename
               operation is performed. This is due to limitations of some
               operating/file systems.

           mkpath => 0
               By default the method creates any non-existent parent directory
               for the given target path. That feature can be disabled setting
               this flag to 0.

           cleanup => 1
               If the transfer fails, remove the incomplete file.

               This option is set to by default when there is not possible to
               resume the transfer afterwards (i.e., when using `atomic` or
               `numbered` options).

           best_effort => 1
               Ignore minor errors as setting time or permissions.

           conversion => $conversion
               on the fly data conversion of the file contents can be
               performed with this option. See "On the fly data conversion"
               below.

           callback => $callback
               $callback is a reference to a subroutine that will be called
               after every iteration of the download process.

               The callback function will receive as arguments: the current
               Net::SFTP::Foreign object; the data read from the remote file;
               the offset from the beginning of the file in bytes; and the
               total size of the file in bytes.

               This mechanism can be used to provide status messages, download
               progress meters, etc.:

                   sub callback {
                       my($sftp, $data, $offset, $size) = @_;
                       print "Read $offset / $size bytes\r";
                   }

               The "abort" method can be called from inside the callback to
               abort the transfer:

                   sub callback {
                       my($sftp, $data, $offset, $size) = @_;
                       if (want_to_abort_transfer()) {
                           $sftp->abort("You wanted to abort the transfer");
                       }
                   }

               The callback will be called one last time with an empty data
               argument to indicate the end of the file transfer.

               The size argument can change between different calls as data is
               transferred (for instance, when on-the-fly data conversion is
               being performed or when the size of the file can not be
               retrieved with the "stat" SFTP command before the data transfer
               starts).

           block_size => $bytes
               size of the blocks the file is being split on for transfer.
               Incrementing this value can improve performance but most
               servers limit the maximum size.

           queue_size => $size
               read and write requests are pipelined in order to maximize
               transfer throughput. This option allows one to set the maximum
               number of requests that can be concurrently waiting for a
               server response.

       $sftp->get_content($remote)
           Returns the content of the remote file.

       $sftp->get_symlink($remote, $local, %opts)
           copies a symlink from the remote server to the local file system

           The accepted options are "overwrite" and "numbered". They have the
           same effect as for the "get" method.

       $sftp->put($local, $remote, %opts)
           Uploads a file $local from the local host to the remote host saving
           it as $remote. By default file attributes are also copied. For
           instance:

             $sftp->put("test.txt", "test.txt")
               or die "put failed: " . $sftp->error;

           A file handle can also be passed in the $local argument. In that
           case, data is read from there and stored in the remote file. UTF8
           data is not supported unless a custom converter callback is used to
           transform it to bytes. The method will croak if it encounters any
           data in perl internal UTF8 format. Note also that the handle is not
           closed when the transmission finish.

           Example:

             binmode STDIN;
             $sftp->put(\*STDIN, "stdin.dat") or die "put failed";
             close STDIN;

           This method accepts several options:

           copy_time => $bool
               determines if access and modification time attributes have to
               be copied from remote file. Default is to copy them.

           copy_perm => $bool
               determines if permission attributes have to be copied from
               remote file. Default is to copy them after applying the local
               process umask.

           umask => $umask
               allows one to select the umask to apply when setting the
               permissions of the copied file. Default is to use the umask for
               the current process.

           perm => $perm
               sets the permission mask of the file to be $perm, umask and
               local permissions are ignored.

           overwrite => 0
               by default "put" will overwrite any pre-existent file with the
               same name at the remote side. Setting this flag to zero will
               make the method fail in that case.

           numbered => 1
               when set, a sequence number is added to the remote file name in
               order to avoid overwriting pre-existent files. Off by default.

           append => 1
               appends the local file at the end of the remote file instead of
               overwriting it. If the remote file does not exist a new one is
               created. Off by default.

           resume => 1 | 'auto'
               resumes an interrupted transfer.

               If the "auto" value is given, the transfer will be resumed only
               when the remote file is newer than the local one.

           sparse => 1
               Blocks that are all zeros are skipped possibly creating an
               sparse file on the remote host.

           mkpath => 0
               By default the method creates any non-existent parent directory
               for the given target path. That feature can be disabled setting
               this flag to 0.

           atomic => 1
               The local file contents are transferred into a temporal file
               that once the copy completes is renamed to the target
               destination.

               This operation relies on the SSH server to perform an
               overwriting/non-overwriting atomic rename operation free of
               race conditions.

               OpenSSH server does it correctly on top of Linux/UNIX native
               file systems (i.e. ext[234]>, ffs or zfs) but has problems on
               file systems not supporting hard links (i.e. FAT) or on
               operating systems with broken POSIX semantics as Windows.

           cleanup => 1
               If the transfer fails, attempts to remove the incomplete file.
               Cleanup may fail (for example, if the SSH connection gets
               broken).

               This option is set by default when the transfer is not
               resumable (i.e., when using `atomic` or `numbered` options).

           best_effort => 1
               Ignore minor errors, as setting time and permissions on the
               remote file.

           conversion => $conversion
               on the fly data conversion of the file contents can be
               performed with this option. See "On the fly data conversion"
               below.

           callback => $callback
               $callback is a reference to a subroutine that will be called
               after every iteration of the upload process.

               The callback function will receive as arguments: the current
               Net::SFTP::Foreign object; the data that is going to be written
               to the remote file; the offset from the beginning of the file
               in bytes; and the total size of the file in bytes.

               The callback will be called one last time with an empty data
               argument to indicate the end of the file transfer.

               The size argument can change between calls as data is
               transferred (for instance, when on the fly data conversion is
               being performed).

               This mechanism can be used to provide status messages, download
               progress meters, etc.

               The "abort" method can be called from inside the callback to
               abort the transfer.

           block_size => $bytes
               size of the blocks the file is being split on for transfer.
               Incrementing this value can improve performance but some
               servers limit its size and if this limit is overpassed the
               command will fail.

           queue_size => $size
               read and write requests are pipelined in order to maximize
               transfer throughput. This option allows one to set the maximum
               number of requests that can be concurrently waiting for a
               server response.

           late_set_perm => $bool
               See the FAQ below.

       $sftp->put_content($bytes, $remote, %opts)
           Creates (or overwrites) a remote file whose content is the passed
           data.

       $sftp->put_symlink($local, $remote, %opts)
           Copies a local symlink to the remote host.

           The accepted options are "overwrite" and "numbered".

       $sftp->abort()
       $sftp->abort($msg)
           This method, when called from inside a callback sub, causes the
           current transfer to be aborted

           The error state is set to SFTP_ERR_ABORTED and the optional $msg
           argument is used as its textual value.

       $sftp->ls($remote, %opts)
           Fetches a listing of the remote directory $remote. If $remote is
           not given, the current remote working directory is listed.

           Returns a reference to a list of entries. Every entry is a
           reference to a hash with three keys: "filename", the name of the
           entry; "longname", an entry in a "long" listing like "ls -l"; and
           "a", a Net::SFTP::Foreign::Attributes object containing file atime,
           mtime, permissions and size.

               my $ls = $sftp->ls('/home/foo')
                   or die "unable to retrieve directory: ".$sftp->error;

               print "$_->{filename}\n" for (@$ls);

           The options accepted by this method are as follows (note that usage
           of some of them can degrade the method performance when reading
           large directories):

           wanted => qr/.../
               Only elements whose name matches the given regular expression
               are included on the listing.

           wanted => sub {...}
               Only elements for which the callback returns a true value are
               included on the listing. The callback is called with two
               arguments: the $sftp object and the current entry (a hash
               reference as described before). For instance:

                 use Fcntl ':mode';

                 my $files = $sftp->ls ( '/home/hommer',
                                         wanted => sub {
                                             my $entry = $_[1];
                                             S_ISREG($entry->{a}->perm)
                                         } )
                       or die "ls failed: ".$sftp->error;

           no_wanted => qr/.../
           no_wanted => sub {...}
               those options have the opposite result to their "wanted"
               counterparts:

                 my $no_hidden = $sftp->ls( '/home/homer',
                                            no_wanted => qr/^\./ )
                       or die "ls failed";

               When both "no_wanted" and "wanted" rules are used, the
               "no_wanted" rule is applied first and then the "wanted" one
               (order is important if the callbacks have side effects,
               experiment!).

           ordered => 1
               the list of entries is ordered by filename.

           follow_links => 1
               by default, the attributes on the listing correspond to a
               "lstat" operation, setting this option causes the method to
               perform "stat" requests instead. "lstat" attributes will still
               appear for links pointing to non existent places.

           atomic_readdir => 1
               reading a directory is not an atomic SFTP operation and the
               protocol draft does not define what happens if "readdir"
               requests and write operations (for instance "remove" or "open")
               affecting the same directory are intermixed.

               This flag ensures that no callback call ("wanted", "no_wanted")
               is performed in the middle of reading a directory and has to be
               set if any of the callbacks can modify the file system.

           realpath => 1
               for every file object, performs a realpath operation and
               populates the "realpath" entry.

           names_only => 1
               makes the method return a simple array containing the file
               names from the remote directory only. For instance, these two
               sentences are equivalent:

                 my @ls1 = @{ $sftp->ls('.', names_only => 1) };

                 my @ls2 = map { $_->{filename} } @{$sftp->ls('.')};

       $sftp->find($path, %opts)
       $sftp->find(\@paths, %opts)
           Does a recursive search over the given directory $path (or
           directories @path) and returns a list of the entries found or the
           total number of them on scalar context.

           Every entry is a reference to a hash with two keys: "filename", the
           full path of the entry; and "a", a Net::SFTP::Foreign::Attributes
           object containing file atime, mtime, permissions and size.

           This method tries to recover and continue under error conditions.

           The options accepted:

           on_error => sub { ... }
               the callback is called when some error is detected, two
               arguments are passed: the $sftp object and the entry that was
               being processed when the error happened. For instance:

                 my @find = $sftp->find( '/',
                                         on_error => sub {
                                             my ($sftp, $e) = @_;
                                             print STDERR "error processing $e->{filename}: "
                                                  . $sftp->error;
                                         } );

           realpath => 1
               calls method "realpath" for every entry, the result is stored
               under the key "realpath". This option slows down the process as
               a new remote query is performed for every entry, specially on
               networks with high latency.

           follow_links => 1
               By default symbolic links are not resolved and appear as that
               on the final listing. This option causes then to be resolved
               and substituted by the target file system object. Dangling
               links are ignored, though they generate a call to the
               "on_error" callback when stat fails on them.

               Following symbolic links can introduce loops on the search.
               Infinite loops are detected and broken but files can still
               appear repeated on the final listing under different names
               unless the option "realpath" is also active.

           ordered => 1
               By default, the file system is searched in an implementation
               dependent order (actually optimized for low memory
               consumption). If this option is included, the file system is
               searched in a deep-first, sorted by filename fashion.

           wanted => qr/.../
           wanted => sub { ... }
           no_wanted => qr/.../
           no_wanted => sub { ... }
               These options have the same effect as on the "ls" method,
               allowing to filter out unwanted entries (note that filename
               keys contain full paths here).

               The callbacks can also be used to perform some action instead
               of creating the full listing of entries in memory (that could
               use huge amounts of RAM for big file trees):

                 $sftp->find($src_dir,
                             wanted => sub {
                                 my $fn = $_[1]->{filename}
                                 print "$fn\n" if $fn =~ /\.p[ml]$/;
                                 return undef # so it is discarded
                             });

           descend => qr/.../
           descend => sub { ... }
           no_descend => qr/.../
           no_descend => sub { ... }
               These options, similar to the "wanted" ones, allow one to prune
               the search, discarding full subdirectories. For instance:

                   use Fcntl ':mode';
                   my @files = $sftp->find( '.',
                                            no_descend => qr/\.svn$/,
                                            wanted => sub {
                                                S_ISREG($_[1]->{a}->perm)
                                            } );

               "descend" and "wanted" rules are unrelated. A directory
               discarded by a "wanted" rule will still be recursively searched
               unless it is also discarded on a "descend" rule and vice versa.

           atomic_readdir => 1
               see "ls" method documentation.

           names_only => 1
               makes the method return a list with the names of the files only
               (see "ls" method documentation).

               equivalent:

                 my $ls1 = $sftp->ls('.', names_only => 1);

       $sftp->glob($pattern, %opts)
           performs a remote glob and returns the list of matching entries in
           the same format as the "find" method.

           This method tries to recover and continue under error conditions.

           The given pattern can be a UNIX style pattern (see glob(7)) or a
           Regexp object (i.e "qr/foo/"). In the later case, only files on the
           current working directory will be matched against the Regexp.

           Accepted options:

           ignore_case => 1
               by default the matching over the file system is carried out in
               a case sensitive fashion, this flag changes it to be case
               insensitive.

               This flag is ignored when a Regexp object is used as the
               pattern.

           strict_leading_dot => 0
               by default, a dot character at the beginning of a file or
               directory name is not matched by wildcards ("*" or "?").
               Setting this flags to a false value changes this behaviour.

               This flag is ignored when a Regexp object is used as the
               pattern.

           follow_links => 1
           ordered => 1
           names_only => 1
           realpath => 1
           on_error => sub { ... }
           wanted => ...
           no_wanted => ...
               these options perform as on the "ls" method.

           Some usage samples:

             my $files = $sftp->glob("*/lib");

             my $files = $sftp->glob("/var/log/dmesg.*.gz");

             $sftp->set_cwd("/var/log");
             my $files = $sftp->glob(qr/^dmesg\.[\d+]\.gz$/);

             my $files = $sftp->glob("*/*.pdf", strict_leading_dot => 0);

       $sftp->rget($remote, $local, %opts)
           Recursively copies the contents of remote directory $remote to
           local directory $local. Returns the total number of elements
           (files, directories and symbolic links) successfully copied.

           This method tries to recover and continue when some error happens.

           The options accepted are:

           umask => $umask
               use umask $umask to set permissions on the files and
               directories created.

           copy_perm => $bool;
               if set to a true value, file and directory permissions are
               copied to the remote server (after applying the umask). On by
               default.

           copy_time => $bool;
               if set to a true value, file atime and mtime are copied from
               the remote server. By default it is on.

           overwrite => $bool
               if set to a true value, when a local file with the same name
               already exists it is overwritten. On by default.

           numbered => $bool
               when required, adds a sequence number to local file names in
               order to avoid overwriting pre-existent remote files. Off by
               default.

           newer_only => $bool
               if set to a true value, when a local file with the same name
               already exists it is overwritten only if the remote file is
               newer.

           ignore_links => $bool
               if set to a true value, symbolic links are not copied.

           on_error => sub { ... }
               the passed sub is called when some error happens. It is called
               with two arguments, the $sftp object and the entry causing the
               error.

           wanted => ...
           no_wanted => ...
               This option allows one to select which files and directories
               have to be copied. See also "ls" method docs.

               If a directory is discarded all of its contents are also
               discarded (as it is not possible to copy child files without
               creating the directory first!).

           atomic => 1
           block_size => $block_size
           queue_size => $queue_size
           conversion => $conversion
           resume => $resume
           best_effort => $best_effort
               See "get" method docs.

       $sftp->rput($local, $remote, %opts)
           Recursively copies the contents of local directory $local to remote
           directory $remote.

           This method tries to recover and continue when some error happens.

           Accepted options are:

           umask => $umask
               use umask $umask to set permissions on the files and
               directories created.

           copy_perm => $bool;
               if set to a true value, file and directory permissions are
               copied to the remote server (after applying the umask). On by
               default.

           copy_time => $bool;
               if set to a true value, file atime and mtime are copied to the
               remote server. On by default.

           perm => $perm
               Sets the permission of the copied files to $perm. For
               directories the value "$perm|0300" is used.

               Note that when this option is used, umask and local permissions
               are ignored.

           overwrite => $bool
               if set to a true value, when a remote file with the same name
               already exists it is overwritten. On by default.

           newer_only => $bool
               if set to a true value, when a remote file with the same name
               already exists it is overwritten only if the local file is
               newer.

           ignore_links => $bool
               if set to a true value, symbolic links are not copied

           on_error => sub { ... }
               the passed sub is called when some error happens. It is called
               with two arguments, the $sftp object and the entry causing the
               error.

           wanted => ...
           no_wanted => ...
               This option allows one to select which files and directories
               have to be copied. See also "ls" method docs.

               If a directory is discarded all of its contents are also
               discarded (as it is not possible to copy child files without
               creating the directory first!).

           atomic => 1
           block_size => $block_size
           queue_size => $queue_size
           conversion => $conversion
           resume => $resume
           best_effort => $best_effort
           late_set_perm => $bool
               see "put" method docs.

       $sftp->rremove($dir, %opts)
       $sftp->rremove(\@dirs, %opts)
           recursively remove directory $dir (or directories @dirs) and its
           contents. Returns the number of elements successfully removed.

           This method tries to recover and continue when some error happens.

           The options accepted are:

           on_error => sub { ... }
               This callback is called when some error is occurs. The
               arguments passed are the $sftp object and the current entry (a
               hash containing the file object details, see "ls" docs for more
               information).

           wanted => ...
           no_wanted => ...
               Allows one to select which file system objects have to be
               deleted.

       $sftp->mget($remote, $localdir, %opts)
       $sftp->mget(\@remote, $localdir, %opts)
           expands the wildcards on $remote or @remote and retrieves all the
           matching files.

           For instance:

             $sftp->mget(['/etc/hostname.*', '/etc/init.d/*'], '/tmp');

           The method accepts all the options valid for "glob" and for "get"
           (except those that do not make sense :-)

           $localdir is optional and defaults to the process current working
           directory ("cwd").

           Files are saved with the same name they have in the remote server
           excluding the directory parts.

           Note that name collisions are not detected. For instance:

            $sftp->mget(["foo/file.txt", "bar/file.txt"], "/tmp")

           will transfer the first file to "/tmp/file.txt" and later overwrite
           it with the second one. The "numbered" option can be used to avoid
           this issue.

       $sftp->mput($local, $remotedir, %opts)
       $sftp->mput(\@local, $remotedir, %opts)
           similar to "mget" but works in the opposite direction transferring
           files from the local side to the remote one.

       $sftp->join(@paths)
           returns the given path fragments joined in one path (currently the
           remote file system is expected to be UNIX like).

       $sftp->open($path, $flags [, $attrs ])
           Sends the "SSH_FXP_OPEN" command to open a remote file $path, and
           returns an open handle on success. On failure returns "undef".

           The returned value is a tied handle (see Tie::Handle) that can be
           used to access the remote file both with the methods available from
           this module and with perl built-ins. For instance:

             # reading from the remote file
             my $fh1 = $sftp->open("/etc/passwd")
               or die $sftp->error;
             while (<$fh1>) { ... }

             # writing to the remote file
             use Net::SFTP::Foreign::Constants qw(:flags);
             my $fh2 = $sftp->open("/foo/bar", SSH2_FXF_WRITE|SSH2_FXF_CREAT)
               or die $sftp->error;
             print $fh2 "printing on the remote file\n";
             $sftp->write($fh2, "writing more");

           The $flags bitmap determines how to open the remote file as defined
           in the SFTP protocol draft (the following constants can be imported
           from Net::SFTP::Foreign::Constants):

           SSH2_FXF_READ
               Open the file for reading. It is the default mode.

           SSH2_FXF_WRITE
               Open the file for writing.  If both this and "SSH2_FXF_READ"
               are specified, the file is opened for both reading and writing.

           SSH2_FXF_APPEND
               Force all writes to append data at the end of the file.

               As OpenSSH SFTP server implementation ignores this flag, the
               module emulates it (I will appreciate receiving feedback about
               the inter-operation of this module with other server
               implementations when this flag is used).

           SSH2_FXF_CREAT
               If this flag is specified, then a new file will be created if
               one does not already exist.

           SSH2_FXF_TRUNC
               Forces an existing file with the same name to be truncated to
               zero length when creating a file. "SSH2_FXF_CREAT" must also be
               specified if this flag is used.

           SSH2_FXF_EXCL
               Causes the request to fail if the named file already exists.
               "SSH2_FXF_CREAT" must also be specified if this flag is used.

           When creating a new remote file, $attrs allows one to set its
           initial attributes. $attrs has to be an object of class
           Net::SFTP::Foreign::Attributes.

       $sftp->close($handle)
           Closes the remote file handle $handle.

           Files are automatically closed on the handle "DESTROY" method when
           not done explicitly.

           Returns true on success and undef on failure.

       $sftp->read($handle, $length)
           reads $length bytes from an open file handle $handle. On success
           returns the data read from the remote file and undef on failure
           (including EOF).

       $sftp->write($handle, $data)
           writes $data to the remote file $handle. Returns the number of
           bytes written or undef on failure.

           Note that unless the file has been open in "autoflush" mode, data
           will be cached until the buffer fills, the file is closed or
           "flush" is explicitly called. That could also mask write errors
           that would become unnoticed until later when the write operation is
           actually performed.

       $sftp->readline($handle)
       $sftp->readline($handle, $sep)
           in scalar context reads and returns the next line from the remote
           file. In list context, it returns all the lines from the current
           position to the end of the file.

           By default "\n" is used as the separator between lines, but a
           different one can be used passing it as the second method argument.
           If the empty string is used, it returns all the data from the
           current position to the end of the file as one line.

       $sftp->getc($handle)
           returns the next character from the file.

       $sftp->seek($handle, $pos, $whence)
           sets the current position for the remote file handle $handle. If
           $whence is 0, the position is set relative to the beginning of the
           file; if $whence is 1, position is relative to current position and
           if $<$whence> is 2, position is relative to the end of the file.

           returns a trues value on success, undef on failure.

       $sftp->tell($fh)
           returns the current position for the remote file handle $handle.

       $sftp->eof($fh)
           reports whether the remote file handler points at the end of the
           file.

       $sftp->flush($fh)
           writes to the remote file any pending data and discards the read
           cache.

           Note that this operation just sends data cached locally to the
           remote server. You may like to call "fsync" (when supported)
           afterwards to ensure that data is actually flushed to disc.

       $sftp->fsync($fh)
           On servers supporting the "fsync@openssh.com" extension, this
           method calls fysnc(2) on the remote side, which usually flushes
           buffered changes to disk.

       $sftp->sftpread($handle, $offset, $length)
           low level method that sends a SSH2_FXP_READ request to read from an
           open file handle $handle, $length bytes starting at $offset.

           Returns the data read on success and undef on failure.

           Some servers (for instance OpenSSH SFTP server) limit the size of
           the read requests and so the length of data returned can be smaller
           than requested.

       $sftp->sftpwrite($handle, $offset, $data)
           low level method that sends a "SSH_FXP_WRITE" request to write to
           an open file handle $handle, starting at $offset, and where the
           data to be written is in $data.

           Returns true on success and undef on failure.

       $sftp->opendir($path)
           Sends a "SSH_FXP_OPENDIR" command to open the remote directory
           $path, and returns an open handle on success (unfortunately,
           current versions of perl does not support directory operations via
           tied handles, so it is not possible to use the returned handle as a
           native one).

           On failure returns "undef".

       $sftp->closedir($handle)
           closes the remote directory handle $handle.

           Directory handles are closed from their "DESTROY" method when not
           done explicitly.

           Return true on success, undef on failure.

       $sftp->readdir($handle)
           returns the next entry from the remote directory $handle (or all
           the remaining entries when called in list context).

           The return values are a hash with three keys: "filename",
           "longname" and "a". The "a" value contains a
           Net::SFTP::Foreign::Attributes object describing the entry.

           Returns undef on error or when no more entries exist on the
           directory.

       $sftp->stat($path_or_fh)
           performs a "stat" on the remote file and returns a
           Net::SFTP::Foreign::Attributes object with the result values. Both
           paths and open remote file handles can be passed to this method.

           Returns undef on failure.

       $sftp->fstat($handle)
           this method is deprecated.

       $sftp->lstat($path)
           this method is similar to "stat" method but stats a symbolic link
           instead of the file the symbolic links points to.

       $sftp->setstat($path_or_fh, $attrs)
           sets file attributes on the remote file. Accepts both paths and
           open remote file handles.

           Returns true on success and undef on failure.

       $sftp->fsetstat($handle, $attrs)
           this method is deprecated.

       $sftp->truncate($path_or_fh, $size)
       $sftp->chown($path_or_fh, $uid, $gid)
       $sftp->chmod($path_or_fh, $perm)
       $sftp->utime($path_or_fh, $atime, $mtime)
           Shortcuts around "setstat" method.

       $sftp->remove($path)
           Sends a "SSH_FXP_REMOVE" command to remove the remote file $path.
           Returns a true value on success and undef on failure.

       $sftp->mkdir($path, $attrs)
           Sends a "SSH_FXP_MKDIR" command to create a remote directory $path
           whose attributes are initialized to $attrs (a
           Net::SFTP::Foreign::Attributes object).

           Returns a true value on success and undef on failure.

           The $attrs argument is optional.

       $sftp->mkpath($path, $attrs, $parent)
           This method is similar to "mkdir" but also creates any non-existent
           parent directories recursively.

           When the optional argument $parent has a true value, just the
           parent directory of the given path (and its ancestors as required)
           is created.

           For instance:

             $sftp->mkpath("/tmp/work", undef, 1);
             my $fh = $sftp->open("/tmp/work/data.txt",
                                  SSH2_FXF_WRITE|SSH2_FXF_CREAT);

       $sftp->rmdir($path)
           Sends a "SSH_FXP_RMDIR" command to remove a remote directory $path.
           Returns a true value on success and undef on failure.

       $sftp->realpath($path)
           Sends a "SSH_FXP_REALPATH" command to canonicalise $path to an
           absolute path. This can be useful for turning paths containing '..'
           into absolute paths.

           Returns the absolute path on success, "undef" on failure.

           When the given path points to an nonexistent location, what one
           gets back is server dependent. Some servers return a failure
           message and others a canonical version of the path.

       $sftp->rename($old, $new, %opts)
           Sends a "SSH_FXP_RENAME" command to rename $old to $new.  Returns a
           true value on success and undef on failure.

           Accepted options are:

           overwrite => $bool
               By default, the rename operation fails when a file $new already
               exists. When this options is set, any previous existent file is
               deleted first (the "atomic_rename" operation will be used if
               available).

               Note than under some conditions the target file could be
               deleted and afterwards the rename operation fail.

       $sftp->atomic_rename($old, $new)
           Renames a file using the "posix-rename@openssh.com" extension when
           available.

           Unlike the "rename" method, it overwrites any previous $new file.

       $sftp->readlink($path)
           Sends a "SSH_FXP_READLINK" command to read the path where the
           symbolic link is pointing.

           Returns the target path on success and undef on failure.

       $sftp->symlink($sl, $target)
           Sends a "SSH_FXP_SYMLINK" command to create a new symbolic link $sl
           pointing to $target.

           $target is stored as-is, without any path expansion taken place on
           it. Use "realpath" to normalize it:

             $sftp->symlink("foo.lnk" => $sftp->realpath("../bar"))

       $sftp->hardlink($hl, $target)
           Creates a hardlink on the server.

           This command requires support for the 'hardlink@openssh.com'
           extension on the server (available in OpenSSH from version 5.7).

       $sftp->statvfs($path)
       $sftp->fstatvfs($fh)
           On servers supporting "statvfs@openssh.com" and
           "fstatvfs@openssh.com" extensions respectively, these methods
           return a hash reference with information about the file system
           where the file named $path or the open file $fh resides.

           The hash entries are:

             bsize   => file system block size
             frsize  => fundamental fs block size
             blocks  => number of blocks (unit f_frsize)
             bfree   => free blocks in file system
             bavail  => free blocks for non-root
             files   => total file inodes
             ffree   => free file inodes
             favail  => free file inodes for to non-root
             fsid    => file system id
             flag    => bit mask of f_flag values
             namemax => maximum filename length

           The values of the f_flag bit mask are as follows:

             SSH2_FXE_STATVFS_ST_RDONLY => read-only
             SSH2_FXE_STATVFS_ST_NOSUID => no setuid

       $sftp->test_d($path)
           Checks whether the given path corresponds to a directory.

       $sftp->test_e($path)
           Checks whether a file system object (file, directory, etc.) exists
           at the given path.

       $sftp->disconnect
           Closes the SSH connection to the remote host. From this point the
           object becomes mostly useless.

           Usually, this method should not be called explicitly, but
           implicitly from the DESTROY method when the object goes out of
           scope.

           See also the documentation for the "autodiscconnect" constructor
           argument.

       $sftp->autodisconnect($ad)
           Sets the "autodisconnect" behaviour.

           See also the documentation for the "autodiscconnect" constructor
           argument. The values accepted here are the same as there.

   On the fly data conversion
       Some of the methods on this module allow one to perform on the fly data
       conversion via the "conversion" option that accepts the following
       values:

       conversion => 'dos2unix'
           Converts CR+LF line endings (as commonly used under MS-DOS) to LF
           (UNIX).

       conversion => 'unix2dos'
           Converts LF line endings (UNIX) to CR+LF (DOS).

       conversion => sub { CONVERT $_[0] }
           When a callback is given, it is invoked repeatedly as chunks of
           data become available. It has to change $_[0] in place in order to
           perform the conversion.

           Also, the subroutine is called one last time with and empty data
           string to indicate that the transfer has finished, so that
           intermediate buffers can be flushed.

           Note that when writing conversion subroutines, special care has to
           be taken to handle sequences crossing chunk borders.

       The data conversion is always performed before any other callback
       subroutine is called.

       See the Wikipedia entry on line endings
       <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline> or the article Understanding
       Newlines by Xavier Noria
       (<http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2006/08/17/understanding-newlines.html>)
       for details about the different conventions.

FAQ
       Closing the connection:
           Q: How do I close the connection to the remote server?

           A: let the $sftp object go out of scope or just undefine it:

             undef $sftp;

       Using Net::SFTP::Foreign from a cron script:
           Q: I wrote a script for performing sftp file transfers that works
           beautifully from the command line. However when I try to run the
           same script from cron it fails with a broken pipe error:

             open2: exec of ssh -l user some.location.com -s sftp
               failed at Net/SFTP/Foreign.pm line 67

           A: "ssh" is not on your cron PATH.

           The remedy is either to add the location of the "ssh" application
           to your cron PATH or to use the "ssh_cmd" option of the "new"
           method to hardcode the location of "ssh" inside your script, for
           instance:

             my $ssh = Net::SFTP::Foreign->new($host,
                                               ssh_cmd => '/usr/local/ssh/bin/ssh');

       "more" constructor option expects an array reference:
           Q: I'm trying to pass in the private key file using the -i option,
           but it keep saying it couldn't find the key. What I'm doing wrong?

           A: The "more" argument on the constructor expects a single option
           or a reference to an array of options. It will not split an string
           containing several options.

           Arguments to SSH options have to be also passed as different
           entries on the array:

             my $sftp = Net::SFTP::Foreign->new($host,
                                                 more => [qw(-i /home/foo/.ssh/id_dsa)]);

           Note also that latest versions of Net::SFTP::Foreign support the
           "key_path" argument:

             my $sftp = Net::SFTP::Foreign->new($host,
                                                 key_path => '/home/foo/.ssh/id_dsa');

       Plink and password authentication
           Q: Why password authentication is not supported for the plink SSH
           client?

           A: A bug in plink breaks it.

           Newer versions of Net::SFTP::Foreign pass the password to "plink"
           using its "-pw" option. As this feature is not completely secure a
           warning is generated.

           It can be silenced (though, don't do it without understanding why
           it is there, please!) as follows:

             no warnings 'Net::SFTP::Foreign';
             my $sftp = Net::SFTP::Foreign->new('foo@bar',
                                                ssh_cmd => 'plink',
                                                password => $password);
             $sftp->die_on_error;

       Plink
           Q: What is "plink"?

           A: Plink is a command line tool distributed with the PuTTY
           <http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/> SSH client. Very popular
           between MS Windows users, it is also available for Linux and other
           UNIX now.

       Put method fails
           Q: put fails with the following error:

             Couldn't setstat remote file: The requested operation cannot be
             performed because there is a file transfer in progress.

           A: Try passing the "late_set_perm" option to the put method:

             $sftp->put($local, $remote, late_set_perm => 1)
                or die "unable to transfer file: " . $sftp->error;

           Some servers do not support the "fsetstat" operation on open file
           handles. Setting this flag allows one to delay that operation until
           the file has been completely transferred and the remote file handle
           closed.

           Also, send me a bug report containing a dump of your $sftp object
           so I can add code for your particular server software to activate
           the work-around automatically.

       Put method fails even with late_set_perm set
           Q: I added "late_set_perm => 1" to the put call, but we are still
           receiving the error "Couldn't setstat remote file (setstat)".

           A: Some servers forbid the SFTP "setstat" operation used by the
           "put" method for replicating the file permissions and time-stamps
           on the remote side.

           As a work around you can just disable the feature:

             $sftp->put($local_file, $remote_file,
                        copy_perm => 0, copy_time => 0);

       Disable password authentication completely
           Q: When we try to open a session and the key either doesn't exist
           or is invalid, the child SSH hangs waiting for a password to be
           entered.  Is there a way to make this fail back to the Perl program
           to be handled?

           A: Disable anything but public key SSH authentication calling the
           new method as follows:

             $sftp = Net::SFTP::Foreign->new($host,
                           more => [qw(-o PreferredAuthentications=publickey)])

           See ssh_config(5) for the details.

       Understanding "$attr->perm" bits
           Q: How can I know if a directory entry is a
           (directory|link|file|...)?

           A: Use the "S_IS*" functions from Fcntl. For instance:

             use Fcntl qw(S_ISDIR);
             my $ls = $sftp->ls or die $sftp->error;
             for my $entry (@$ls) {
               if (S_ISDIR($entry->{a}->perm)) {
                 print "$entry->{filename} is a directory\n";
               }
             }

       Host key checking
           Q: Connecting to a remote server with password authentication fails
           with the following error:

             The authenticity of the target host can not be established,
             connect from the command line first

           A: That probably means that the public key from the remote server
           is not stored in the "~/.ssh/known_hosts" file. Run an SSH
           Connection from the command line as the same user as the script and
           answer "yes" when asked to confirm the key supplied.

           Example:

             $ ssh pluto /bin/true
             The authenticity of host 'pluto (172.25.1.4)' can't be established.
             RSA key fingerprint is 41:b1:a7:86:d2:a9:7b:b0:7f:a1:00:b7:26:51:76:52.
             Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes

           Your SSH client may also support some flag to disable this check,
           but doing it can ruin the security of the SSH protocol so I advise
           against its usage.

           Example:

             # Warning: don't do that unless you fully understand
             # its security implications!!!
             $sftp = Net::SFTP::Foreign->new($host,
                                             more => [-o => 'StrictHostKeyChecking no'],
                                             ...);

BUGS
       These are the currently known bugs:

       - Doesn't work on VMS:
           The problem is related to IPC::Open3 not working on VMS. Patches
           are welcome!

       - Dirty cleanup:
           On some operating systems, closing the pipes used to communicate
           with the slave SSH process does not terminate it and a work around
           has to be applied. If you find that your scripts hung when the
           $sftp object gets out of scope, try setting
           $Net::SFTP::Foreign::dirty_cleanup to a true value and also send me
           a report including the value of $^O on your machine and the OpenSSH
           version.

           From version 0.90_18 upwards, a dirty cleanup is performed anyway
           when the SSH process does not terminate by itself in 8 seconds or
           less.

       - Reversed symlink arguments:
           This package uses the non-conforming OpenSSH argument order for the
           SSH_FXP_SYMLINK command that seems to be the de facto standard.
           When interacting with SFTP servers that follow the SFTP
           specification, the "symlink" method will interpret its arguments in
           reverse order.

       - IPC::Open3 bugs on Windows
           On Windows the IPC::Open3 module is used to spawn the slave SSH
           process. That module has several nasty bugs (related to STDIN,
           STDOUT and STDERR being closed or not being assigned to file
           descriptors 0, 1 and 2 respectively) that will cause the connection
           to fail.

           Specifically this is known to happen under mod_perl/mod_perl2.

       - Password authentication on HP-UX
           For some unknown reason, it seems that when using the module on HP-
           UX, number signs ("#") in password need to be escaped ("\#"). For
           instance:

             my $password = "foo#2014";
             $password =~ s/#/\\#/g if $running_in_hp_ux;
             my $ssh = Net::OpenSSH->new($host, user => $user,
                                         password => $password);

           I don't have access to an HP-UX machine, and so far nobody using it
           has been able to explain this behaviour. Patches welcome!

       - Taint mode and data coming through SFTP
           When the module finds it is being used from a script started in
           taint mode, on every method call it checks all the arguments passed
           and dies if any of them is tainted. Also, any data coming through
           the SFTP connection is marked as tainted.

           That generates an internal conflict for those methods that under
           the hood query the remote server multiple times, using data from
           responses to previous queries (tainted) to build new ones (die!).

           I don't think a generic solution could be applied to this issue
           while honoring the taint-mode spirit (and erring on the safe side),
           so my plan is to fix that in a case by case manner.

           So, please report any issue you find with taint mode!

       Also, the following features should be considered experimental:

       - support for Tectia server

       - numbered feature

       - autodie mode

       - best_effort feature

SEE ALSO
       Information about the constants used on this module is available from
       Net::SFTP::Foreign::Constants. Information about attribute objects is
       available from Net::SFTP::Foreign::Attributes.

       General information about SSH and the OpenSSH implementation is
       available from the OpenSSH web site at <http://www.openssh.org/> and
       from the sftp(1) and sftp-server(8) manual pages.

       Net::SFTP::Foreign integrates nicely with my other module Net::OpenSSH.

       Net::SFTP::Foreign::Backend::Net_SSH2 allows one to run
       Net::SFTP::Foreign on top of Net::SSH2 (nowadays, this combination is
       probably the best option under Windows).

       Modules offering similar functionality available from CPAN are
       Net::SFTP and Net::SSH2.

       Test::SFTP allows one to run tests against a remote SFTP server.

       autodie.
