VN_ISDISK(9)           FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual          VN_ISDISK(9)

NAME
     vn_isdisk – checks if a vnode represents a disk

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <sys/vnode.h>

     int
     vn_isdisk(struct vnode *vp, int *errp);

DESCRIPTION
     The vn_isdisk() function checks to see if vp represents a disk.  In order
     for vp to be a disk, it must be a character device, v_rdev must be valid,
     and the cdevsw entry's flags must have D_DISK set.

     Its arguments are:

     vp        The vnode to check.

     errp      An integer pointer to store the error number in if the call
               fails.

RETURN VALUES
     If the vnode represents a disk, 1 is returned; otherwise, 0 is returned
     and errp will contain the error number.
