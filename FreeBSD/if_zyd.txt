ZYD(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 ZYD(4)

NAME
     zyd – ZyDAS ZD1211/ZD1211B USB IEEE 802.11b/g wireless network device

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device ehci
           device uhci
           device ohci
           device usb
           device zyd
           device wlan
           device wlan_amrr

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_zyd_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The zyd driver provides support for wireless network adapters based
     around the ZyDAS ZD1211 and ZD1211B USB chips.

     zyd supports station and monitor mode operation.  Only one virtual
     interface may be configured at any time.  For more information on
     configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

EXAMPLES
     The following example configures zyd0 to join any BSS network using WEP
     key “0x1deadbeef1”, channel 11:

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev zyd0 channel 11 \
               wepmode on wepkey 0x1deadbeef1 weptxkey 1 \
               inet 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0

     Join an existing BSS network, “my_net”:

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev zyd0 192.168.0.2 \
               netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_net

DIAGNOSTICS
     zyd%d: could not load firmware (error=%d)  An error occurred while
     attempting to upload the firmware to the onboard microcontroller unit.

     zyd%d: could not send command (error=%s)  An attempt to send a command to
     the firmware failed.

     zyd%d: sorry, radio %s is not supported yet  Support for the specified
     radio chip is not yet implemented in the driver.  The device will not
     attach.

     zyd%d: device version mismatch: 0x%x (only >= 43.30 supported)  Early
     revisions of the ZD1211 chipset are not supported by this driver.  The
     device will not attach.

     zyd%d: device timeout  A frame dispatched to the hardware for
     transmission did not complete in time.  The driver will reset the
     hardware.  This should not happen.

AUTHORS
     The original zyd driver was written by Florian Stoehr
     <ich@florian-stoehr.de>, Damien Bergamini <damien@openbsd.org>, and
     Jonathan Gray <jsg@openbsd.org>.

CAVEATS
     The zyd driver does not support a lot of the functionality available in
     the hardware.  More work is required to properly support the IBSS and
     power management features.
