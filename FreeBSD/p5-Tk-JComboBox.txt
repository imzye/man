NAME
       Tk::JComboBox - Create and manipulate JComboBox widgets

SYNOPSIS
           $jcb = $parent->JComboBox(?options);

DESCRIPTION
       JComboBox is a composite widget that contains a text Label or Entry, a
       Button, and a popup Listbox. It performs the same sort of tasks that
       can be accomplished by several other Composite widgets. Some such as
       BrowseEntry and Optionmenu are part of the standard Tk distribution,
       and there are many others available in CPAN.

       JComboBox borrows features from the Java Swing component bearing the
       same name, but falls short of being a true clone. Many of the methods
       and the general look and feel should be familiar to java developers.
       JComboBox also combines several features offered by many of the other
       "Combo Box" implementations, and works in two modes: editable and
       readonly.

       In readonly mode, JComboBox offers similar functionality to Optionmenu.
       It is basically a labeled button that activates a popup list.  An item
       from the list is displayed on the Button when selected.

       When editable, JComboBox somewhat resembles BrowseEntry. That is, the
       widget is composed of an Entry widget with a Button to the right of it.
       As in the editable mode, the Button activates a popup Listbox from
       which a single item can be selected.

       For more detailed information on using this widget, refer to the
       JComboBox tutorial.

COMPONENTS
       You should use caution when configuring JComboBox subwidgets. Extensive
       configuration changes may result in unexpected or invalid behavior. The
       subwidgets are advertised to allow for fine tuned configuration of the
       internal subwidgets, when there no provided options or methods that
       will do what you need.

   Subwidgets used in readonly mode
       Entry, RO_Entry
           Widget: Label

           This Label is used to display the selected item from the popup
           Listbox. This widget and the Button subwidget form the face of the
           Button that triggers the popup Listbox.

   Subwidgets used in editable mode
       Entry, ED_Entry
           Widget: Entry

           This Entry is used to display the selected item from the popup
           Listbox, or can accept input that does not appear within the
           Listbox.

   Subwidgets used in both modes
       Button, ED_Button, RO_Button
           Widget: Label

           This Label is used to trigger the Popup Listbox, and by default
           displays a bitmap of a filled triangle that points downward. This
           subwidget only supports Label options.

       Popup
           Widget: Toplevel

           This widget contains the Listbox subwidget that displays one or
           more entries that can be selected for the JComboBox. This is mostly
           used a container (and an additional way of configuring the Listbox
           dimensions).

       Listbox
           Widget: Listbox

           Used to contain one or more entries, one of which can be selected
           and displayed within the Box subwidget. Note: use caution when
           using this Subwidget directly. In 804 versions of Tk, Listbox has a
           memory leak. It's suggested that you use JComboBox methods for
           adding/deleting/clearing Listbox elements to avoid the leak.

OPTIONS
       JComboBox supports a long list of options, so to try and break them up
       a bit I've grouped them in sections. The Basic section contains options
       that implement or override standard Tk options. or deal with simple
       things such as colors. The Callback section contains all the options
       that can have configured Callbacks. The Miscellaneous section contains
       options that are unique to this widget. These options provide complex
       functionality that can alter look and feel or provide for
       initialization shortcuts.

   Basic options
       -background/-bg
           NAME: background  CLASS: Background

           Specifies the normal background color to use when displaying the
           widget. This color will be applied to all internal widgets as well.
           For fine-tuned configuration of subwidgets, refer to the
           -subwidgets option.

       -bitmap
           Specifies a bitmap to display in the Button subwidget. Defaults to
           a filled,downward pointing triangle.

       -borderwidth/-bd
           NAME: borderwidth CLASS: BorderWidth

           Specifies a non-negative value indicated the width of the of the
           3-D border to draw around the outside of the widget.

       -cursor
           NAME: cursor CLASS: Cursor

           Specifies the mouse cursor to be used for the widget. This cursor
           will be applied to all internal widgets as well.

       -disabledbackground
           Specifies the background color to display when the JComboBox state
           is set to disabled. This option currently only affects the Entry
           subwidget, while in editable mode.

       -disabledforeground
           Specifies the foreground color to display when the JComboBox state
           is set to disabled. This option affects both the Entry and Button
           subwidgets in either mode.

       -entrybackground
           Specifies the background color used in one or more subwidgets
           depending on the mode. In both modes, the color is applied to the
           Entry and Listbox subwidgets. In readonly mode, the background is
           also applied to the Button subwidget.

       -entrywidth
           NAME: entryWidth CLASS: EntryWidth

           Specifies a value to use for sizing the width of the Entry
           subwidget. The specified value can fall in one of three categories.
           If a value greater than 0 is specified, then the Entry will use
           that width regardless of the contents of the Listbox, or values set
           to the Listbox. If the value is set to 0, then the Entry will be
           sized large enough to hold its current text. If set to -1, the
           Entry will be sized to the longest item currently contained within
           the Listbox. The value defaults to -1, which works well for when
           the JComboBox contains a fairly static list. Otherwise, a value
           greater than 0 is recommended.

       -font
           NAME: font CLASS: Font

           Specifies the font to use when drawing text inside the widget. This
           font will be applied to internal widgets that can display a font.

       -foreground/fg
           NAME: foreground CLASS: Foreground

           Specifies the foreground color to use for the Entry and Listbox
           subwidget in either mode.

       -gap
           NAME: gap CLASS: Gap

           Specifies the number of spaces (in characters) between the Entry
           and the Button subwidgets. Default value is 0.

       -highlightbackground
           Specifies the color to display in the highlight region when the
           widget does not have the input focus.

       -highlightcolor
           Specifies the color to use for the highlight rectangle that is
           drawn around the widget when it has the input focus.

       -highlightthickness
           Specifies the size of the rectangle surrounding the JComboBox that
           changes color when it has the focus. The default value is 0. Note
           that on Win32 systems, focus is drawn slightly differently than on
           other systems. JComboBox does not currently account for the
           difference.

       -pady
           OptionDB NAME: pady CLASS: PadY

           Specifies the width of a rectangular border to insert between the
           Entry/Button Subwidgets and their container. This can be used to
           enlarge the height of the JComboBox. It has no default value.

       -relief
           NAME: relief CLASS: Relief

           Specifies the border style desired for the widget. Acceptable
           values are raised, sunken, flat, ridge, solid, and groove. The
           value indicates how the interior of the widget should appear
           relative to its exterior; for example, raised means the interior of
           the widget should appear to protrude from the screen, relative to
           the exterior of the widget. The default value depends on the mode:
           groove in readonly mode and sunken in editable mode.

       -selectbackground
           Specifies the background color to use when displaying selected
           items. This value will be applied to the Listbox in both modes, and
           to the Entry subwidget in editable mode.

       -selectborderwidth
           Specifies a non-negative value indicating the width of the 3-D
           border to draw around selected items. The value may have any of the
           forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels. This value will be applied to the
           Listbox subwidget in both modes, and to the Entry subwidget in
           editable mode.

       -selectforeground
           Specifies the foreground color to use when displaying selected
           items. This value will be applied to the Listbox subwidget in both
           modes, and to the Entry subwidget in editable mode.

       -state
           NAME: state CLASS: State

           Specifies one of two state values for the JComboBox: normal and
           disabled. When the state is set to disabled, the event handlers
           will not respond to user events, and the color of the JComboBox
           will change depending on the mode. In both modes,
           -disableforeground will be applied to both the Entry and Button
           subwidgets' foreground. In editable mode, -disablebackground will
           be applied to the Entry subwidget's background. The disabled state
           also causes -takefocus to be set to 0. Changing the state back to
           the default of normal will reverse these changes to the JComboBox.

       -takefocus
           NAME: takeFocus CLASS: TakeFocus

           Determines whether or not the JComboBox takes focus or not during
           keyboard traversal. This setting defaults to 1 and is crucial to
           the JComboBox accepting keyboard events. Regardless of mode, it is
           the Entry subwidget within the JComboBox that receives the focus,
           and so it should be the target of any key binding.

       -textvariable
           NAME: textVariable CLASS: Variable

           Used to pass a scalar reference into the JComboBox that will
           provide a way of setting and accessing the selected value. This
           option can be used as an alternative to using the various widget
           methods because scalar references that are passed are tied to
           widget methods. Every time the variable is accessed, it is roughly
           equivalent to calling: getSelectedValue(), and every time the
           variable is set, it is like calling: setSelected($value, -type =
           'value')>.

           Because each Listbox entry in JComboBox could represent two pieces
           of information, it's important to understand precisely what the
           -textvariable provides access to. Given the following setup:

              my $value;
              my $jcb = $mw->JComboBox(
                 -textvariable => \$value,
                 -choices => [
                    {-name => 'one', -value => 1},
                    {-name => 'two', -value => 2},
                    "three"
                 ],
              )->pack;

           The following should be expected:

              $jcb->setSelectedIndex(0);
              print $value . "\n";    ## prints 1
              $jcb->setSelectedIndex(2);
              print $value . "\n";    ## prints three

           And the following would also be expected:

              $this = 2;        ## changes the selection to "two"
              $this = "three";  ## changes the selection to "three"

           Because no value for "three" was specified, the value defaults to
           "three" for the purpose of both examples. Note that the mode may
           limit what can be set as well. For example, in "readonly" mode, the
           only items that can be selected are those that appear within the
           Listbox.

           Note: Unlike other widgets, -textvariable is tightly controlled
           within JComboBox and experimentation is recommended if you plan to
           use it. It can be used as a shortcut for setting/retrieving item
           values.

   Callback options
       Some of the options have changed names since the previous version.
       -menucreate/-menumodify, for example are now,
       -popupcreate/-popupmodify. After having now looked at the code for a
       year or so, the old names felt wrong. After all, it is not a menu that
       is displayed, its a Listbox, and the two are very different. Because I
       had a subwidget called Popup, it seemed to make more sense to me for
       these options to use "popup" instead of "menu".

       -matchcommand
           Specifies a callback that will be used to determine whether a
           specified String matches a field within the popup Listbox. This
           callback will be invoked every time a search for an index is done.
           This callback will be utilized within the getItemIndex method, and
           through the Autofind functionality (which uses getItemIndex).

           Callbacks are passed at least two parameters: $searchStr and
           $field. searchStr contains the search string. This will be the
           search pattern. When the -matchcommand is not set, all special
           regex patterns are escaped, and the search is generally anchored to
           the start of any string it will compared to. field is a single item
           within the list that the searchStr is being checked against. It
           will either be the name, which is the String that appears in the
           list, or it's value. The value is non-visible element associated
           with the visible one. A callback should return 1 if the match
           succeeds, and 0 otherwise.

           Refer to the tutorial for more information on this option.

       -popupcreate/-listcmd
           Specifies a callback that will be invoked prior to showing the
           Popup Listbox. This callback is the first of two callback options
           that can be invoked prior to displaying the Popup. The most common
           use case would be for someone wanting to dynamically populate the
           contents of the widget prior to displaying it. After this callback
           is invoked JComboBox will go through it's own internal routine of
           configuring the height/width and positioning characteristics of the
           Popup. Some of this is driven by various configuration options. The
           downside of this is that any configuration of this type done within
           a popupcreate callback may be overridden.

           Note for versions prior to 1.12: In prior versions, this callback
           could be configured to completely replace the internal
           positioning/configuration of the Popup. This is a good deal of
           trouble for soneone to go through, and it didn't seem to be a
           likely need -- espcially given the presence of the -popupmodify
           option. Developers using this option in older versions, can call
           $jcb->PopupCreate within their custom -popupcreate callback to get
           an aproximation of the functionality in 1.12 and beyond. Also in
           older versions if the JComboBox contained no items or was already
           being displayed this callback would not be invoked. This is no
           longer the case.

       -popupmodify
           Specifies a callback to call immediately before the Popup is shown.
           This is the second of two callbacks called prior to displaying the
           Popup. This callback can be used to override any height/width or
           positional configuration done prior to this callback. It serves as
           a mechanism for the developer to have the final word in how the
           Popup should display before it is shown. The expectation is that
           use of this option will be rare and most developers will prefer the
           -popupcreate option over this one.

       -selectcommand/-browsecmd
           Specifies a callback to call every time a selection is made within
           the JComboBox. The specified callback will be passed the following
           arguments, in this order: $jcbWidget, $selectedIndex,
           $selectedValue, $selectedName. In cases where a value is not
           specified for an entry, the value will be the same as for
           $selectedName. In editable mode, when an entry is displayed that
           does not appear within the Listbox, the $selectedIndex will be set
           to -1, and both the selectedName and selectedValue will be the
           value displayed within the Entry subwidget. The selectcommand
           CALLBACK will only be called once after each change to the
           selection. This option is roughly equivalent to the -browsecmd and
           -browse2cmd found in BrowseEntry.

       -validatecommand
           Specifies a callback to evaluate when you want to validate the
           input into the entry widget. Setting it to undef disables this
           feature (the default). This command must return a valid boolean
           value. If it returns 0 (or the valid boolean equivalent) then it
           means you reject the new edition and it will not occur and the
           invalidCommand will be evaluated if it is set. If it returns 1,
           then the new edition occurs. More details of this option can be
           found in the documentation for the Entry widget. Also take a look
           at the -validate option listed later in this document.

   Miscellaneous options
       -autofind
           Specifies the configuration parameters for a set of functionality
           that uses key strokes to quickly locate and/or select entries
           within the Popup Listbox. This option takes a reference to a hash
           containing one or more options that each take a boolean value. Some
           options have no effect depending on the mode.

           The options currently include:

           -enable - Specifies whether or not to enable autofind or not. The
           value defaults to 1.

           -casesensitive - Specifies whether or not the autofind capability
           should ignore the case of each keystroke when finding a match in
           the List. Defaults to 0.

           -complete - Specifies whether or not to use auto completion when
           the JComboBox is in editable mode. Auto completion causes the
           remainder of an entry to be filled in when a matching entry is
           found, though the entry is not yet selected. Defaults to 0. Note,
           this option is ignored regardless of value when the -select option
           is enabled.

           -select - Selects the first item in the list that matches the
           keystroke (in editable mode), and entry (in readonly mode).
           Repeated keys/entries will cause the next matching entry to be
           selected. Defaults to 0. This option takes priority over the
           -complete option.

           -showpopup - Specifies whether or not to display the Popup Listbox
           when a matching entry is found within the list. Defaults to 1.

           More information on this option can be found in the tutorial under
           Using Autofind.

       -listhighlight
           NAME: listHighlight CLASS: ListHighlight

           Specifies whether or not list highlighting should be set. List
           highlighting is typical on Win32 Combo Box implementations. When
           the mouse is over a Listbox item, the item appears as though it
           were selected in the Listbox. A value of 1 enabled the feature, and
           0 deactivates it. The default setting is 1.

       -listwidth
           NAME: listWidth CLASS: ListWidth

           By default, the width of the Popup is sized to fit the width of the
           JComboBox. This option allows that behavior to be modified. If
           defined, the listwidth will be applied to the width of the Listbox,
           and the width of the Listbox will be the primary factor in sizing
           the Popup (borderwidth of the Popup, and presence of a scrollbar
           also will figure into sizing). The default value is -1.

       -maxrows
           NAME: maxRows Class: MaxRows

           Specifies a maximum number of rows that will be displayed in the
           Listbox subwidget. If the Listbox contains fewer elements than the
           specified size, then it will shrink to fit only that number. If
           there are more elements than the specified maxrows size, then the
           Listbox will adjust the height to the specified number and use a
           scrollbar for accessing the other elements. Defaults to 10. Note:
           if a specified maxrows value causes the Popup to expand beyond the
           top and bottom of the screen, then the maxrow setting will be
           overridden automatically so that the popup can be contained within
           the screen.

       -mode
           NAME: mode  CLASS: Mode

           Specifies the operating mode of the JComboBox, and can either by
           readonly, the default, or editable. The mode can currently only be
           set at Creation time, and cannot be reconfigured. Some options can
           have subtly different affects depending on the mode. These cases
           will be noted under the documentation for each option.

       -updownselect
           NAME: updownSelect CLASS: UpDownSelect

           When the JComboBox has focus, and the popup is visible, the arrow
           keys can be used to move the Listbox selection up or down. The
           Listbox selection is not necessarily equivalent to the JComboBox
           selection. In Win32 Combo Box implementations, it is common for the
           up/down keys to also affect the JComboBox selection along with the
           Listbox selection. This option toggles that behavior. If set to 1
           then the arrow keys will treat the previous or next item in the
           Listbox as the selected item in the JComboBox, and if set to 0, it
           won't. The default setting is 1.

       -validate
           NAME: validate CLASS: Validate

           This option is only used when in editable mode, and generally is
           exactly the same as the same option for the Entry Widget. It
           specifies the mode in which validation should operate: none, focus,
           focusin, focusout, key, or all. It defaults to none. When you want
           validation, you must explicitly state which mode you wish to use.

           In addition, there are two other values: match and cs-match that
           restrict values to entries that are contained within the internal
           List. cs-match treats case as significant, and match does not. When
           used, these options effectively negate the editable mode. When
           these values are configured, the JComboBox automatically configures
           its own CALLBACK for the -validatecommand option.

   The Choices option
       -choices/-options
           Specifies a reference to an array to use to populate the JComboBox
           with entries. This option is meant to be used when creating the
           Widget, and reconfiguring this option will first delete any
           preexisting entries before adding the new ones. The value is
           expected to be an array reference. Setting the value to an empty
           string will remove the tie along with any existing entries.

       As of version 1.07, setting the -choices option will do more than
       simply populate the JComboBox Listbox -- it will tie the internal List
       to the array. This means that as an alternative to using the various
       public methods, you can use the array as an interface. Changes made to
       the array will be reflected in the JComboBox, and vice versa.

       As of version 1.08, a single array can be associated with multiple
       JComboBox instances. However, the precise behavior merits further
       explanation. Not all associated instances have the same relationship
       with the array. The first instance to be configured with the array
       becomes the master instance, and all other instances retain roles as
       observers. When changes are made to the array, both master and
       observers will be modified to reflect the change. Changes made to the
       master through its methods will reflected in the array, and those made
       to observers will not. If the master is reconfigured to use a different
       choices array, then all of the other observers will automatically be
       reconfigured as well. If an observer is reconfigured, then it will be
       the only one to be changed. If the new array is not already associated
       with other JComboBox instances, then the observer will become the
       master instance for the new array,

       For more details on using this option, refer to the section in the
       tutorial, Access Through the Choices Array.

METHODS
       $jcb->addItem(string, ?option => value)
           Appends a new Listitem to be used in the Popup Listbox. string is a
           scalar variable that will be displayed in the Listbox. This method
           takes two options -selected and -value:

           -selected => selected

           Where selected is a boolean value (true/yes/1) and determines
           whether or not the list item is the select item within the
           JComboBox. The default value for this is false. Any subsequent call
           that uses this option overrides previous ones.

           -value => value

           Where value is an alternate scalar associated with the List item
           for times when it's desirable to have a value other than the one
           displayed (can be useful for database applications).

           Example:

              $jcb->addItem('Alaska', -value => 'AK', -selected => 1);

       $jcb->clearSelection()
           Clears the current selected item in the JComboBox, if one is
           selected.

       $jcb->getItemIndex(string, ?option => value, ...)
           Searches the JComboBox for the first item that matches the given
           string and returns that item's index. If no match is found, returns
           -1. This methods supports the options -mode and -type.

           -type => type

           Where type is either name, which is the displayed text, or value,
           which is the alternate value associated with the item. If an item
           in the JComboBox does not have a value defined, then that item's
           name will be used. Defaults to name.

           -mode => mode

           Where mode affects how the given string is compared to a list item.
           Values include: exact, usecase, and ignorecase. exact means that
           the string must completely match the list item, including case.
           usecase means that the string must match the beginning of the list
           item, including its case. ignorecase means that the string must
           match the beginning of the list item, regardless of the case.
           Defaults to exact.

           Example:

            ## Finds first matching list item that has a value complete matching AK
            my $index = $jcb->getItemIndex('AK', -type => 'value');
            ## Finds the first matching list item that starts with the letter 'a'
            my $index = $jcb->getItemIndex('a', -mode => 'usecase');
            ## Finds the first matching list item that starts with 'a' or 'A'
            my $index = $jcb->getItemIndex('a', -mode => 'ignorecase');

       $jcb->getItemCount()
           Returns the number of list items stored in the JComboBox.

       $jcb->getSelectedIndex()
           Returns the index of the current selected item or -1, if none of
           the items is selected.

       $jcb->getSelectedValue()
           Returns the value of the current selected value or an undef if
           there isn't one selected. In editable mode, if there is no item
           selected, it will return the contents of the Entry widget, if there
           are any characters there, and an undef.

       $jcb->getItemNameAt(index)
           Returns the string displayed in the Listbox at the specified index,
           or undef if there is no name at the specified index (index out of
           range).

       $jcb->getItemValueAt(index)
           Returns the alternate value associated with the list item at the
           specified index if it is set. Otherwise, the displayed name will be
           returned (The same as if getItemNameAt had been called).

       $jcb->hidePopup()
           Causes the popup Listbox to the withdrawn from the screen,
           unmapping it.

       $jcb->index(index)
           Returns the integer value that corresponds to index. If index is
           end then return value is a count of the number of elements in the
           Listbox (not the index of the last element).

       $jcb->insertItemAt(index, string, ?option => value, ...)
           Inserts a new list item into the JComboBox at the specified index.
           Refer to the section on indices in the Listbox documentation.
           string is a scalar variable that will be displayed in the Listbox
           (also referred to in this document as the List item name). This
           method takes two options: -selected and -value.

           -selected => selected

           Where selected is a boolean value (true/yes/1) and determines
           whether or not the list item is the select item within the
           JComboBox. The default value for this is false. Any subsequent call
           that uses this option overrides previous ones.

           -value => value

           Where value is an alternate scalar associated with the List item
           for times when it's desirable to have a value other than the one
           displayed (can be useful for database applications).

           Example:

           The following example produces the same result as the example given
           for addItem:

              $jcb->insertItemAt('end', 'ALASKA', -value => 'AK', -selected => 1);

       $jcb->popupIsVisible()
           Returns 1 if the popup is visible (mapped) and 0 otherwise.

       $jcb->removeAllItems()
           Completely removes all list items from the JComboBox, and clears
           any selected item if present. In editable mode, this will also
           clear the Entry widget.

       $jcb->removeItemAt(index)
           Deletes a single list item from the JComboBox at the specified
           index.

       $jcb->see(index)
           Adjusts the JComboBox so that the list item indicated by the
           specified index is visible. If the Listbox is hidden, it will be
           made visible, and the list will shift so that the item is viewable.

       $jcb->setSelected(string, ?option => value, ...)
           Sets the index of the first element that matches the specified
           string as selected, and has no effect if there are no matches.
           Generally, this method is a lot like getItemIndex, and takes the
           same options: -type and -mode.

           -type => type

           Where type is either name, which is the displayed text, or value,
           which is the alternate value associated with the item. If an item
           in the JComboBox does not have a value defined, then that item's
           name will be used. Defaults to name.

           -mode => mode

           Where mode affects how the given string is compared to a list item.
           Values include: exact, usecase, and ignorecase. exact means that
           the string must completely match the list item, including case.
           usecase means that the string must match the beginning of the list
           item, including its case. ignorecase means that the string must
           match the beginning of the list item, regardless of the case.
           Defaults to exact.

       $jcb->setSelectedIndex(index)
           Selects the list item at the specified index, and has no effect if
           the specified index does not exist.

       $jcb->showPopup()
           Displays the popup Listbox if hidden (normally triggered by
           JComboBox button, or one of the key bindings. This method invokes
           CALLBACK registered to -menu create, which defaults to the
           ShowPopup method. When this method is called, it will make a global
           Grab, and will temporarily steal grab from any other window that
           made a grab. Call "hidePopup" to release the grab and return it to
           whatever widget had it before this method was called. This is
           useful when using JComboBox within DialogBox widgets.

BINDINGS
   Default Keyboard Bindings
       Like other Combo Box implementations, JComboBox now has a set of
       Keyboard bindings that provide access to the entries within the popup
       Listbox. The precise behavior of some of these bindings will depend on
       JComboBox options such as -autofind, -list highlighting, and
       -updownselect.

       Alt-Down
           Toggles the visibility of the Popup. The event handler is AltDown.

       Alt-Up
           Hides the popup. The event handler is hidePopup.

       Down
           Moves the Listbox selection down by one entry as long as there is
           an entry for the selection to move to. Refer to documentation on
           -autofind and -updownselect. The Event Handler is UpDown.

       Escape
           Hides the popup. The event handler is hidePopup.

       FocusOut
           Sets the displayed entry as selected. Uses the Enter event handler.

       KeyPress
           The precise behavior of a Key press depends on the -mode and the
           -autofind option. The default behavior for readonly mode is similar
           to what you might encounter in a Windows environment. The List
           items will be searched and the first entry that begins with the
           pressed letter will be selected, regardless of case. If the same
           key is pressed again, then the search will begin from the previous
           match. The Listbox will be shown, and the matching entry will be
           selected and visible.

           For the editable mode, the default behavior is identical, except
           that instead of just the first letter, the entire String within the
           Entry will be used for the search. Refer to the Tutorial
           documentation on Customizing Interface Behavior for more
           information. Uses the KeyPress event handler.

       Up  Moves the Listbox selection up by one entry as long as there is an
           entry for the selection to move to. Refer to documentation on
           -updownselect. The Event Handler is UpDown.

   Creating your own bindings
       There really isn't much in the way of convention or policy on how
       composite widgets, such as JComboBox should handle events and binding,
       so JComboBox tries to strike a balance between between simplicity,
       flexibility, and functionality. Even so, simplicity sometimes takes a
       back seat to the other two. Let's say that after checking out the
       options, you decide that none of the built-in behavior provides quite
       what you need, and you decide that a binding is necessary.

       If the binding is not for a key-related event, then I'd suggest that
       you bind directly to one of JComboBox's Subwidgets. They are all
       documented. You might consider passing a variable containing the
       JComboBox instead to your event handler as well, because the first
       parameter passed to your subroutine will be the Subwidget being bound.
       Be aware that some of these Subwidget may already be bound internally
       by JComboBox.

       If you are interested in making a key binding, then my best advice
       would be to bind to the Entry subwidget, since it is the only widget
       within JComboBox that has been setup to takefocus. It is important to
       remember that most of the bindings that are listed in this document,
       are also bound to Entry, so test any binding you do very carefully to
       ensure that it does what you wish. Here is an example of how a binding
       for the <Return> (Enter) key might be done (this should work equally
       well for either mode):

          use Tk;
          use Tk::JComboBox;

          my $variable;
          my $mw = MainWindow->new;
          my $jcb = $mw->JComboBox(
             -choices => [
                { -name => 'Black',  -value => '#000000' },
                { -name => 'Blue',   -value => '#0000ff' },
                { -name => 'Green',  -value => '#008000' },
                { -name => 'Purple', -value => '#8000ff' },
                { -name => 'Red',    -value => '#ff0000' },
                { -name => 'Yellow', -value => '#ffff00' }],
             -textvariable => \$variable
          )->pack;
          $jcb->Subwidget('Entry')->bind('<Return>', [\&Submit, $jcb]);
          $jcb->focus;

          MainLoop;

          sub Submit {
             my ($entry, $jcb) = @_;
             print "\nSubmit Called\n";
             my $index = $jcb->getSelectedIndex();
             print "Index: $index \n";
             print "value: " . $jcb->getSelectedValue() . "\n";
             print "name:  " . $jcb->getItemNameAt($index) . "\n";
             print "textvariable: $variable \n";
             $done = "done";
          }

ALTERNATIVES
   Standard distribution
       If JComboBox doesn't fit your needs, you're free to modify the code as
       you see fit, but before you do, you might consider some of the
       alternatives that are available on CPAN. Even if none of the others is
       a perfect fit, it may be closer to what you were looking for, and be
       easier to modify.

       The standard distribution contains two Composites that do some of what
       JComboBox does: Tk::BrowseEntry and Tk::Optionmenu. BrowseEntry
       visually resembles JComboBox in editable mode to a certain extent, and
       Optionmenu is a bit like JComboBox in readonly mode. The main
       difference is that JComboBox more closely resembles a Win32 Combo Box
       (Pre-Windows XP).

   Available on CPAN
       On CPAN, there are a few more choices available:

       JBrowseEntry
           JBrowseEntry is maintained by Jim Turner, and began as an enhanced
           version of BrowseEntry in the main distribution. JBrowseEntry
           initially tweaked the appearance of the composite, and added key
           bindings including one to search for List entries corresponding to
           a key press. JBrowseEntry has since been modified to have a Win32
           appearance when used on Windows versions. One of its nice touches
           is that it has the option of specifying a different bitmap for
           arrow button for when the widget has focus. It's a nice idea, and
           one way of working around focus and highlighting issues -- I might
           keep that in the mind for the future.

           I'm not precisely sure how JBrowseEntry currently compares to
           BrowseEntry, but at one time JBrowseEntry provided key bindings
           where JComboBox did not, and since it was an enhanced BrowseEntry,
           someone could replace any instances of BrowseEntry without breaking
           their existing code, and then take advantage of the enhancements,
           which is a real advantage for someone looking for a nice upgrade
           with little to no integration work. The same can <i>not</i> be said
           for JComboBox.It was never intended as a clone or enhanced
           BrowseEntry.

           JBrowseEntry's document isn't that current unfortunately. It leads
           one to believe that JComboBox does not provide key bindings. At one
           time, this was true, but as of release 1.0, JComboBox also has key
           bindings and is generally more configurable than JBrowseEntry, and
           provides more out-of-the-box functionality. To be fair, this does
           come at price: JComboBox has a larger number of options and
           methods, and can be more difficult to learn. The hopeful payoff is
           that less time should be required to implement common Combo Box
           behavior leaving more time to implement core business requirements.

       ComboEntry
           ComboEntry is part of distribution (Tk-DKW) created by Damion
           Wilson. This was one of the first Combo Box-type widgets available
           on CPAN, outside of the main distribution. Damion's distribution
           served as a good source of examples when I was first learning Tk,
           and I have a soft spot for them, but I've found many of the widgets
           in the distribution to be buggy, and not documented very well.
           Also, the distribution has not been updated since 1999, so it
           appears to be unsupported. Having said that, ComboEntry may still
           serve as a useful starting point for your own customized version.

       MenuEntry
           MenuEntry is part of Graham Barr's, Tk-GBARR distribution, which is
           currently maintained by Slaven Rezic. MenuEntry was one of the
           "unfinished" widgets included in that distribution, and was the
           widget I used as the initial starting point for this widget
           (Thanks, Graham!). It is as bare bones an implementation as you're
           likely to find, plus I liked it's look. I initially made only a few
           minor modifications, then a few more, and finally it got to the
           point where it no longer resembled Graham's widget. Like
           ComboEntry, I think this is a great widget for use as a starting
           point, when creating your own, if you should decide to go that
           route.

       HistEntry
           HistEntry is a specialized BrowseEntry widget maintained by Slaven
           Rezic. It's purpose is to maintain an internal list of items that
           are added by adding text and then hitting <Return>.

       MatchEntry
           MatchEntry is an Entry/Listbox combination maintained by Wolfgang
           Hommel that is used to provide a user friendly auto-completion
           functionality. The Listbox and auto-completion capabilities are
           key-driven, and provides a large number of options for configuring
           the widget. Unlike the other widgets mentioned above the Listbox
           popup is not triggered by a Button, because MatchEntry doesn't have
           one. Like HistEntry, MatchEntry is intended for a specialized
           function. JComboBox also provides some limited auto-completion
           capabilities, but they are not as sophisticated as what MatchEntry
           provides.
