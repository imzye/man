CvsGraph(1)                    CVS/RCS Utilities                   CvsGraph(1)

NAME
       cvsgraph - A CVS/RCS repository grapher

SYNOPSIS
       cvsgraph [options] [file]

DESCRIPTION
       CvsGraph generates images and image maps from CVS/RCS repository files.

OPTIONS
       -b     Deprecated, use -O'branch_dupbox=-1' for same functionality.

       -c file
              Read alternate config from file.

       -d level
              Enable debug mode at level. The amount of information is
              determined by a bitwise or of the following: 1=config lexer,
              2=config parser, 4=rcsfile lexer, 8=rcsfile parser, 16=rcsfile
              structure. The level argument may be in decimal, octal or
              hexadecimal format.

       -h     A brief description of possible options.

       -i     Generate an image map instead of an image.

       -I file
              Also write an image map to file. This can be useful if you want
              to generate both image and image map simultaneously. This halves
              the total time spent on accessing the repository file because it
              is parsed only once.
              However, keeping track of auto-generated files can be a bit of a
              hack if used in HTTP requests (unless you pass both image and
              HTML file in one HTTP stream).
              Note 1: most time is used for the image-drawing routines
              (actually libgd), so you might want to think twice in CGI apps.
              Note 2: you can still use '-o' to specify an output file for the
              image.  And, if you also specify '-i', then you'll get two image
              maps, for whatever purpose that might be.

       -k     Deprecated, use -O'auto_stretch=-1' for same functionality.
              This function is not stable.

       -M name
              Deprecated, use -O'map_name="AMapName"' for same functionality.

       -m mod Use mod as the CVS module.  This option overrides cvsmodule in
              the configuration file.

       -O cfg_option=value[;opt=val[...]]
              Set cfg_option to value. Multiple -O are allowed as well as
              multiple options can be set simultaneously by separating them
              with ';'.  See cvsgraph.conf(5) for a detailed list of options.
              See also CONFIGURATION below.

       -o file
              Output to file. Otherwise, output is written to standard output.

       -q     Be quiet (i.e. no warnings)

       -r path
              Use path as the CVS root.  This option overrides cvsroot in the
              configuration file.

       -s     Deprecated, use -O'strip_untagged=-1' for same functionality.

       -S     Deprecated, use -O'strip_first_rev=-1' for same functionality.

       -u     Deprecated, use -O'upside_down=-1' for same functionality.

       -V     Print version and exit.

       -x {3,4,x}
              Set the HTML level of compliance for image maps. Use 3 for HTML
              3.x, 4 for HTML 4.x and x for XHTML. Default is HTML 3.x
              compatibility.

       -[0-9] txt
              Use txt for expansion

CONFIGURATION
       CvsGraph starts with reading a configuration file. If the '-c' option
       is given on the command line, then it is read. Otherwise, cvsgraph
       first looks for a configuration file in the current directory using
       ./cvsgraph.conf and, if not found, tries to open
       ${prefix}/etc/cvsgraph.conf. Defaults and command line overrides will
       be used if no configuration file can be opened. The format of the
       configuration file is described in cvsgraph.conf(5). Configuration
       parameters entered on the command line have always precedence over the
       configuration file. Configuration options are processed in the
       following order:
       - configuration file
       - '-O' command line options
       - other command line overrides (-bkMmrSsu)
       If you do not want to process any configuration file, then you can set
       option ´-c /dev/null', which will read an empty configuration file.

       The location of a repository file is determined by the configuration
       parameters cvsroot and cvsmodule and the respective command line
       options '-r' and '-m'.  The cvsroot, cvsmodule and file are
       concatenated with separating '/' path-separators forming the final
       location:
       <cvsroot>/<cvsmodule>/file
       No path-separator is appended if cvsroot and cvsmodule are empty
       strings. An error message is issued if the resulting path cannot be
       opened.  Note that cvsgraph does not attempt to check any validity of
       the path components. This enables a user to open any file on the
       file-system by setting cvsroot and cvsmodule to empty strings.
       For example, cvsgraph -r '' -m '' ../myfile,v would try to open the
       file ../myfile,v. Note that a variety of possibilities yield the same
       file and all have their advantages and drawbacks, which are mostly
       related to the possible use of the parameters in text expansions.

       If no file is given on the command line, then input is read from
       standard input. This can make expansion strings somewhat strange
       looking, but they are composed with the information available. If no
       input file was given, then the input filename for expansion is set to
       <stdin>.


OUTPUT
       The output generated by cvsgraph can be either an image (default) or
       and HTML image map ('-i' and '-I' options).
       Images can have several formats, depending on the capabilities of the
       gd library on which the drawing is built. The configuration allows for
       GIF, PNG or JPEG type images. Some recent versions of gd do no longer
       support GIF and PNG will be used instead. GIF support in gd was added
       again after the lzw patent expired.
       Generation of image maps conforms to the HTML standard and maps
       rectangular regions of the image where revisions and branches are
       drawn. Additionally, an extra rectangular region is generated between
       revisions to support diff generation.

FILES
       ${prefix}/etc/cvsgraph.conf
              Configuration file read for default layout parameters.
