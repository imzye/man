FIREWIRE(4)            FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual            FIREWIRE(4)

NAME
     firewire – IEEE1394 High-performance Serial Bus

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following line in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device firewire

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           firewire_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     FreeBSD provides machine-independent bus support and raw drivers for
     firewire interfaces.

     The firewire driver consists of two layers: the controller and the bus
     layer.  The controller attaches to a physical bus (like pci(4)).  The
     firewire bus attaches to the controller.  Additional drivers can be
     attached to the bus.

     Up to 63 devices, including the host itself, can be attached to a
     firewire bus.  The root node is dynamically assigned with a PHY device
     function.  Also, the other firewire bus specific parameters, e.g., node
     ID, cycle master, isochronous resource manager and bus manager, are
     dynamically assigned, after bus reset is initiated.  On the firewire bus,
     every device is identified by an EUI 64 address.

     Debugging over the firewire interace is possible with the dcons(4)
     driver.  Please see https://wiki.freebsd.org/DebugWithDcons for details
     on how to setup debugging with firewire.
