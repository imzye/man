WTF(6)                       FreeBSD Games Manual                       WTF(6)

NAME
     wtf – look up terms

SYNOPSIS
     wtf [-f dbfile] [-o] [is] term ...

DESCRIPTION
     The wtf utility looks up the meaning of one or more term operands
     specified on the command line.

     term will first be searched for as an acronym in the acronym databases,
     which are expected to be in the format “acronym[tab]meaning”.  If no
     match has been found, wtf will check to see if the term is known by
     whatis(1), pkg_info(1), or, when called from within a pkgsrc package
     directory, pkgsrc's internal help facility, “make help topic=XXX”.

     The optional is operand will be ignored, allowing the fairly natural “wtf
     is WTF” usage.

     The following option is available:

     -f dbfile
           Overrides the default list of acronym databases, bypassing the
           value of the ACRONYMDB variable.  Unlike this variable the -f
           option only accepts one file name as an argument, but it may be
           given multiple times to specify more than one file to use.

     -o    Include acronyms that could be considered offensive to some.
           Please consult fortune(6) for more information about the -o flag.

ENVIRONMENT
     ACRONYMDB  The default list of acronym databases may be overridden by
                setting the environment variable ACRONYMDB to the name of one
                or more space-separated file names of acronym databases.

FILES
     /usr/local/share/wtf/acronyms       default acronym database.
     /usr/local/share/wtf/acronyms-o     default offensive acronym database.
     /usr/local/share/wtf/acronyms.comp  default computer-related acronym
                                         database.

HISTORY
     wtf first appeared in NetBSD 1.5.  Initially it only translated acronyms;
     functionality to look up the meaning of terms in other sources was added
     later.
