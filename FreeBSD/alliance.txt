       MBK_CATAL_NAME - define the mbk catalog file

SYNOPSIS
       c-shell running
       setenv MBK_CATAL_NAME file

DESCRIPTION
       MBK_CATAL_NAME sets the name of the catalog file, that contains
       information about the cells of a design. The catalog file syntax is a
       cellname, plus a flag. The cellname may appear many times with a
       different flag.

       Three flags are available:
                C : tells the flatten functions to stop a this level.
                G : informs the user that this is a phantom cell.
                F : says that this is a feed through.
              The seaching mecanism first look in MBK_WORK_LIB(1), and then in
              MBK_CATA_LIB(1). So it is recommended to have a catalog file in
              the MBK_WORK_LIB(1).

EXAMPLE
            setenv MBK_CATAL_NAME catalog
