DESCRIPTION
     The geli utility is used to configure encryption on GEOM providers.

     The following is a list of the most important features:

           •   Utilizes the crypto(9) framework, so when there is crypto
               hardware available, geli will make use of it automatically.
           •   Supports many cryptographic algorithms (currently AES-XTS,
               AES-CBC, Blowfish-CBC, Camellia-CBC and 3DES-CBC).
           •   Can optionally perform data authentication (integrity
               verification) utilizing one of the following algorithms:
               HMAC/MD5, HMAC/SHA1, HMAC/RIPEMD160, HMAC/SHA256, HMAC/SHA384
               or HMAC/SHA512.
           •   Can create a User Key from up to two, piecewise components: a
               passphrase entered via prompt or read from one or more
               passfiles; a keyfile read from one or more files.
           •   Allows encryption of the root partition.  The user is asked for
               the passphrase before the root filesystem is mounted.
           •   Strengthens the passphrase component of the User Key with: B.
               Kaliski, PKCS #5: Password-Based Cryptography Specification,
               Version 2.0., RFC, 2898.
           •   Allows the use of two independent User Keys (e.g., a "user key"
               and a "company key").
           •   It is fast - geli performs simple sector-to-sector encryption.
           •   Allows the encrypted Master Key to be backed up and restored,
               so that if a user has to quickly destroy key material, it is
               possible to get the data back by restoring keys from backup.
           •   Providers can be configured to automatically detach on last
               close, so users do not have to remember to detach providers
               after unmounting the filesystems.
           •   Allows attaching a provider with a random, one-time Master Key,
               which is useful for swap partitions and temporary filesystems.
           •   Allows verification of data integrity (data authentication).
           •   Allows suspending and resuming encrypted devices.

     The first argument to geli indicates an action to be performed:

     init           Initialize providers which need to be encrypted.  If
                    multiple providers are listed as arguments, they will all
                    be initialized with the same passphrase and/or User Key.
                    A unique salt will be randomly generated for each provider
                    to ensure the Master Key for each is unique.  Here you can
                    set up the cryptographic algorithm to use, Data Key
                    length, etc.  The last sector of the providers is used to
                    store metadata.  The init subcommand also automatically
                    writes metadata backups to /var/backups/<prov>.eli file.
                    The metadata can be recovered with the restore subcommand
                    described below.

                    Additional options include:

                    -a aalgo              Enable data integrity verification
                                          (authentication) using the given
                                          algorithm.  This will reduce the
                                          size of storage available and also
                                          reduce speed.  For example, when
                                          using 4096 bytes sector and
                                          HMAC/SHA256 algorithm, 89% of the
                                          original provider storage will be
                                          available for use.  Currently
                                          supported algorithms are: HMAC/MD5,
                                          HMAC/SHA1, HMAC/RIPEMD160,
                                          HMAC/SHA256, HMAC/SHA384 and
                                          HMAC/SHA512.  If the option is not
                                          given, there will be no
                                          authentication, only encryption.
                                          The recommended algorithm is
                                          HMAC/SHA256.

                    -b                    Try to decrypt this partition during
                                          boot, before the root partition is
                                          mounted.  This makes it possible to
                                          use an encrypted root partition.
                                          One will still need bootable
                                          unencrypted storage with a /boot/
                                          directory, which can be a CD-ROM
                                          disc or USB pen-drive, that can be
                                          removed after boot.

                    -B backupfile         File name to use for metadata backup
                                          instead of the default
                                          /var/backups/<prov>.eli.  To inhibit
                                          backups, you can use none as the
                                          backupfile.  If multiple providers
                                          were initialized in the one command,
                                          you can use PROV (all upper-case) in
                                          the file name, and it will be
                                          replaced with the provider name.  If
                                          PROV is not found in the file name
                                          and multiple providers were
                                          initialized in the one command,
                                          -<prov> will be appended to the end
                                          of the file name specified.

                    -d                    When entering the passphrase to boot
                                          from this encrypted root filesystem,
                                          echo ‘*’ characters.  This makes the
                                          length of the passphrase visible.

                    -e ealgo              Encryption algorithm to use.
                                          Currently supported algorithms are:
                                          AES-XTS, AES-CBC, Blowfish-CBC,
                                          Camellia-CBC, 3DES-CBC, and NULL.
                                          The default and recommended
                                          algorithm is AES-XTS.  NULL is
                                          unencrypted.

                    -g                    Enable booting from this encrypted
                                          root filesystem.  The boot loader
                                          prompts for the passphrase and loads
                                          loader(8) from the encrypted
                                          partition.

                    -i iterations         Number of iterations to use with
                                          PKCS#5v2 when processing User Key
                                          passphrase component.  If this
                                          option is not specified, geli will
                                          find the number of iterations which
                                          is equal to 2 seconds of crypto
                                          work.  If 0 is given, PKCS#5v2 will
                                          not be used.  PKCS#5v2 processing is
                                          performed once, after all parts of
                                          the passphrase component have been
                                          read.

                    -J newpassfile        Specifies a file which contains the
                                          passphrase component of the User Key
                                          (or part of it).  If newpassfile is
                                          given as -, standard input will be
                                          used.  Only the first line
                                          (excluding new-line character) is
                                          taken from the given file.  This
                                          argument can be specified multiple
                                          times, which has the effect of
                                          reassembling a single passphrase
                                          split across multiple files.  Cannot
                                          be combined with the -P option.

                    -K newkeyfile         Specifies a file which contains the
                                          keyfile component of the User Key
                                          (or part of it).  If newkeyfile is
                                          given as -, standard input will be
                                          used.  This argument can be
                                          specified multiple times, which has
                                          the effect of reassembling a single
                                          keyfile split across multiple
                                          keyfile parts.

                    -l keylen             Data Key length to use with the
                                          given cryptographic algorithm.  If
                                          the length is not specified, the
                                          selected algorithm uses its default
                                          key length.

                                                AES-XTS
                                                128, 256

                                                AES-CBC, Camellia-CBC
                                                128, 192, 256

                                                Blowfish-CBC
                                                128 + n * 32, for n=[0..10]

                                                3DES-CBC
                                                192

                    -P                    Do not use a passphrase as a
                                          component of the User Key.  Cannot
                                          be combined with the -J option.

                    -s sectorsize         Change decrypted provider's sector
                                          size.  Increasing the sector size
                                          allows increased performance,
                                          because encryption/decryption which
                                          requires an initialization vector is
                                          done per sector; fewer sectors means
                                          less computational work.

                    -T                    Don't pass through BIO_DELETE calls
                                          (i.e., TRIM/UNMAP).  This can
                                          prevent an attacker from knowing how
                                          much space you're actually using and
                                          which sectors contain live data, but
                                          will also prevent the backing store
                                          (SSD, etc) from reclaiming space
                                          you're not using, which may degrade
                                          its performance and lifespan.  The
                                          underlying provider may or may not
                                          actually obliterate the deleted
                                          sectors when TRIM is enabled, so it
                                          should not be considered to add any
                                          security.

                    -V version            Metadata version to use.  This
                                          option is helpful when creating a
                                          provider that may be used by older
                                          FreeBSD/GELI versions.  Consult the
                                          HISTORY section to find which
                                          metadata version is supported by
                                          which FreeBSD version.  Note that
                                          using an older version of metadata
                                          may limit the number of features
                                          available.

     attach         Attach the given providers.  The encrypted Master Keys are
                    loaded from the metadata and decrypted using the given
                    passphrase/keyfile and new GEOM providers are created
                    using the specified provider names.  A ".eli" suffix is
                    added to the user specified provider names.  Multiple
                    providers can only be attached with a single attach
                    command if they all have the same passphrase and keyfiles.

                    Additional options include:

                    -C                 Do a dry-run decryption.  This is
                                       useful to verify passphrase and keyfile
                                       without decrypting the device.

                    -d                 If specified, the decrypted providers
                                       are detached automatically on last
                                       close, so the user does not have to
                                       remember to detach providers after
                                       unmounting the filesystems.  This only
                                       works when providers were opened for
                                       writing, and will not work if the
                                       filesystems on the providers were
                                       mounted read-only.  Probably a better
                                       choice is the -l option for the detach
                                       subcommand.

                    -n keyno           Specifies the index number of the
                                       Master Key copy to use (could be 0 or
                                       1).  If the index number is not
                                       provided all keys will be tested.

                    -j passfile        Specifies a file which contains the
                                       passphrase component of the User Key
                                       (or part of it).  For more information
                                       see the description of the -J option
                                       for the init subcommand.  The same
                                       passfiles are used for all listed
                                       providers.

                    -k keyfile         Specifies a file which contains the
                                       keyfile component of the User Key (or
                                       part of it).  For more information see
                                       the description of the -K option for
                                       the init subcommand.  The same keyfiles
                                       are used for all listed providers.

                    -p                 Do not use a passphrase as a component
                                       of the User Keys.  Cannot be combined
                                       with the -j option.

                    -r                 Attach read-only providers.  They are
                                       not opened for writing.

     detach         Detach the given providers, which means remove the devfs
                    entry and clear the Master Key and Data Keys from memory.

                    Additional options include:

                    -f     Force detach - detach even if the provider is open.

                    -l     Mark provider to detach on last close, after the
                           last filesystem has been unmounted.  If this option
                           is specified, the provider will not be detached
                           while it is open, but will be automatically
                           detached when it is closed for the last time even
                           if it was only opened for reading.

     onetime        Attach the given providers with a random, one-time
                    (ephemeral) Master Key.  The command can be used to
                    encrypt swap partitions or temporary filesystems.

                    Additional options include:

                    -a aalgo             Enable data integrity verification
                                         (authentication).  For more
                                         information, see the description of
                                         the init subcommand.

                    -e ealgo             Encryption algorithm to use.  For
                                         more information, see the description
                                         of the init subcommand.

                    -d                   Detach on last close, after the last
                                         filesystem has been unmounted.  Note:
                                         this option is not usable for
                                         temporary filesystems as the provider
                                         is detached after the filesystem has
                                         been created.  It still can, and
                                         should, be used for swap partitions.
                                         For more information, see the
                                         description of the attach subcommand.

                    -l keylen            Data Key length to use with the given
                                         cryptographic algorithm.  For more
                                         information, see the description of
                                         the init subcommand.

                    -s sectorsize        Change decrypted provider's sector
                                         size.  For more information, see the
                                         description of the init subcommand.

                    -T                   Disable TRIM/UNMAP passthru.  For
                                         more information, see the description
                                         of the init subcommand.

     configure      Change configuration of the given providers.

                    Additional options include:

                    -b     Set the BOOT flag on the given providers.  For more
                           information, see the description of the init
                           subcommand.

                    -B     Remove the BOOT flag from the given providers.

                    -d     When entering the passphrase to boot from this
                           encrypted root filesystem, echo ‘*’ characters.
                           This makes the length of the passphrase visible.

                    -D     Disable echoing of any characters when a passphrase
                           is entered to boot from this encrypted root
                           filesystem.  This hides the passphrase length.

                    -g     Enable booting from this encrypted root filesystem.
                           The boot loader prompts for the passphrase and
                           loads loader(8) from the encrypted partition.

                    -G     Deactivate booting from this encrypted root
                           partition.

                    -t     Enable TRIM/UNMAP passthru.  For more information,
                           see the description of the init subcommand.

                    -T     Disable TRIM/UNMAP passthru.

     setkey         Install a copy of the Master Key into the selected slot,
                    encrypted with a new User Key.  If the selected slot is
                    populated, replace the existing copy.  A provider has one
                    Master Key, which can be stored in one or both slots, each
                    encrypted with an independent User Key.  With the init
                    subcommand, only key number 0 is initialized.  The User
                    Key can be changed at any time: for an attached provider,
                    for a detached provider, or on the backup file.  When a
                    provider is attached, the user does not have to provide an
                    existing passphrase/keyfile.

                    Additional options include:

                    -i iterations         Number of iterations to use with
                                          PKCS#5v2.  If 0 is given, PKCS#5v2
                                          will not be used.  To be able to use
                                          this option with the setkey
                                          subcommand, only one key has to be
                                          defined and this key must be
                                          changed.

                    -j passfile           Specifies a file which contains the
                                          passphrase component of a current
                                          User Key (or part of it).

                    -J newpassfile        Specifies a file which contains the
                                          passphrase component of the new User
                                          Key (or part of it).

                    -k keyfile            Specifies a file which contains the
                                          keyfile component of a current User
                                          Key (or part of it).

                    -K newkeyfile         Specifies a file which contains the
                                          keyfile component of the new User
                                          Key (or part of it).

                    -n keyno              Specifies the index number of the
                                          Master Key copy to change (could be
                                          0 or 1).  If the provider is
                                          attached and no key number is given,
                                          the key used for attaching the
                                          provider will be changed.  If the
                                          provider is detached (or we are
                                          operating on a backup file) and no
                                          key number is given, the first
                                          Master Key copy to be successfully
                                          decrypted with the provided User Key
                                          passphrase/keyfile will be changed.

                    -p                    Do not use a passphrase as a
                                          component of the current User Key.
                                          Cannot be combined with the -j
                                          option.

                    -P                    Do not use a passphrase as a
                                          component of the new User Key.
                                          Cannot be combined with the -J
                                          option.

     delkey         Destroy (overwrite with random data) the selected Master
                    Key copy.  If one is destroying keys for an attached
                    provider, the provider will not be detached even if all
                    copies of the Master Key are destroyed.  It can even be
                    rescued with the setkey subcommand because the Master Key
                    is still in memory.

                    Additional options include:

                    -a              Destroy all copies of the Master Key (does
                                    not need -f option).

                    -f              Force key destruction.  This option is
                                    needed to destroy the last copy of the
                                    Master Key.

                    -n keyno        Specifies the index number of the Master
                                    Key copy.  If the provider is attached and
                                    no key number is given, the key used for
                                    attaching the provider will be destroyed.
                                    If provider is detached (or we are
                                    operating on a backup file) the key number
                                    has to be given.

     kill           This command should be used only in emergency situations.
                    It will destroy all copies of the Master Key on a given
                    provider and will detach it forcibly (if it is attached).
                    This is absolutely a one-way command - if you do not have
                    a metadata backup, your data is gone for good.  In case
                    the provider was attached with the -r flag, the keys will
                    not be destroyed, only the provider will be detached.

                    Additional options include:

                    -a     If specified, all currently attached providers will
                           be killed.

     backup         Backup metadata from the given provider to the given file.

     restore        Restore metadata from the given file to the given
                    provider.

                    Additional options include:

                    -f     Metadata contains the size of the provider to
                           ensure that the correct partition or slice is
                           attached.  If an attempt is made to restore
                           metadata to a provider that has a different size,
                           geli will refuse to restore the data unless the -f
                           switch is used.  If the partition or slice has been
                           grown, the resize subcommand should be used rather
                           than attempting to relocate the metadata through
                           backup and restore.

     suspend        Suspend device by waiting for all inflight requests to
                    finish, clearing all sensitive information such as the
                    Master Key and Data Keys from kernel memory, and blocking
                    all further I/O requests until the resume subcommand is
                    executed.  This functionality is useful for laptops.
                    Suspending a laptop should not leave an encrypted device
                    attached.  The suspend subcommand can be used rather than
                    closing all files and directories from filesystems on the
                    encrypted device, unmounting the filesystem, and detaching
                    the device.  Any access to the encrypted device will be
                    blocked until the Master Key is reloaded through the
                    resume subcommand.  Thus there is no need to close nor
                    unmount anything.  The suspend subcommand does not work
                    with devices created with the onetime subcommand.  Please
                    note that sensitive data might still be present in memory
                    locations such as the filesystem cache after suspending an
                    encrypted device.

                    Additional options include:

                    -a     Suspend all geli devices.

     resume         Resume previously suspended device.  The caller must
                    ensure that executing this subcommand does not access the
                    suspended device, leading to a deadlock.  For example,
                    suspending a device which contains the filesystem where
                    the geli utility is stored is a bad idea.

                    Additional options include:

                    -j passfile        Specifies a file which contains the
                                       passphrase component of the User Key,
                                       or part of it.  For more information

                                       for the init subcommand.

                    -k keyfile         Specifies a file which contains the
                                       keyfile component of the User Key, or
                                       part of it.  For more information see
                                       the description of the -K option for
                                       the init subcommand.

                    -p                 Do not use a passphrase as a component
                                       of the User Key.  Cannot be combined
                                       with the -j option.

     resize         Inform geli that the provider has been resized.  The old
                    metadata block is relocated to the correct position at the
                    end of the provider and the provider size is updated.

                    Additional options include:

                    -s oldsize        The size of the provider before it was
                                      resized.

     version        If no arguments are given, the version subcommand will
                    print the version of geli userland utility as well as the
                    version of the ELI GEOM class.

                    If GEOM providers are specified, the version subcommand
                    will print metadata version used by each of them.

KEY SUMMARY
   Master Key
     Upon init, the geli utility generates a random Master Key for the
     provider.  The Master Key never changes during the lifetime of the
     provider.  Each copy of the provider metadata, active or backed up to a
     file, can store up to two, independently-encrypted copies of the Master
     Key.

   User Key
     Each stored copy of the Master Key is encrypted with a User Key, which is
     generated by the geli utility from a passphrase and/or a keyfile.  The
     geli utility first reads all parts of the keyfile in the order specified
     on the command line, then reads all parts of the stored passphrase in the
     order specified on the command line.  If no passphrase parts are
     specified, the system prompts the user to enter the passphrase.  The
     passphrase is optionally strengthened by PKCS#5v2.  The User Key is a
     digest computed over the concatenated keyfile and passphrase.

   Data Key
     During operation, one or more Data Keys are deterministically derived by
     the kernel from the Master Key and cached in memory.  The number of Data
     Keys used by a given provider, and the way they are derived, depend on
     the GELI version and whether the provider is configured to use data
     authentication.

SYSCTL VARIABLES
     The following sysctl(8) variables can be used to control the behavior of
     the ELI GEOM class.  The default value is shown next to each variable.
     Some variables can also be set in /boot/loader.conf.

     kern.geom.eli.version
             Version number of the ELI GEOM class.

     kern.geom.eli.debug: 0
             Debug level of the ELI GEOM class.  This can be set to a number
             between 0 and 3 inclusive.  If set to 0, minimal debug
             information is printed.  If set to 3, the maximum amount of debug
             information is printed.

     kern.geom.eli.tries: 3
             Number of times a user is asked for the passphrase.  This is only
             used for providers which are attached on boot, before the root
             filesystem is mounted.  If set to 0, attaching providers on boot
             will be disabled.  This variable should be set in
             /boot/loader.conf.

     kern.geom.eli.overwrites: 5
             Specifies how many times the Master Key is overwritten with
             random values when it is destroyed.  After this operation it is
             filled with zeros.

     kern.geom.eli.visible_passphrase: 0
             If set to 1, the passphrase entered on boot will be visible.
             This alternative should be used with caution as the entered
             passphrase can be logged and exposed via dmesg(8).  This variable
             should be set in /boot/loader.conf.

     kern.geom.eli.threads: 0
             Specifies how many kernel threads should be used for doing
             software cryptography.  Its purpose is to increase performance on
             SMP systems.  If set to 0, a CPU-pinned thread will be started
             for every active CPU.

     kern.geom.eli.batch: 0
             When set to 1, can speed-up crypto operations by using batching.
             Batching reduces the number of interrupts by responding to a
             group of crypto requests with one interrupt.  The crypto card and
             the driver has to support this feature.

     kern.geom.eli.key_cache_limit: 8192
             Specifies how many Data Keys to cache.  The default limit (8192
             keys) will allow caching of all keys for a 4TB provider with 512
             byte sectors and will take around 1MB of memory.

     kern.geom.eli.key_cache_hits
             Reports how many times we were looking up a Data Key and it was
             already in cache.  This sysctl is not updated for providers that
             need fewer Data Keys than the limit specified in
             kern.geom.eli.key_cache_limit.

     kern.geom.eli.key_cache_misses
             Reports how many times we were looking up a Data Key and it was
             not in cache.  This sysctl is not updated for providers that need
             fewer Data Keys than the limit specified in
             kern.geom.eli.key_cache_limit.

EXIT STATUS
     Exit status is 0 on success, and 1 if the command fails.

DEPRECATION NOTICE
     Support for the Blowfish-CBC and 3DES-CBC cryptographic algorithms and
     HMAC/MD5 authentication algorithm will be removed in FreeBSD 13.0.  New
     volumes cannot be created using these algorithms.  Existing volumes
     should be migrated to a new volume that uses non-deprecated algorithms.

EXAMPLES
     Initialize a provider which is going to be encrypted with a passphrase
     and random data from a file on the user's pen drive.  Use 4kB sector
     size.  Attach the provider, create a filesystem, and mount it.  Do the
     work.  Unmount the provider and detach it:

           # dd if=/dev/random of=/mnt/pendrive/da2.key bs=64 count=1
           # geli init -s 4096 -K /mnt/pendrive/da2.key /dev/da2
           Enter new passphrase:
           Reenter new passphrase:
           # geli attach -k /mnt/pendrive/da2.key /dev/da2
           Enter passphrase:
           # dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/da2.eli bs=1m
           # newfs /dev/da2.eli
           # mount /dev/da2.eli /mnt/secret
           ...
           # umount /mnt/secret
           # geli detach da2.eli

     Create an encrypted provider, but use two User Keys: one for your
     employee and one for you as the company's security officer (so it is not
     a tragedy if the employee "accidentally" forgets his passphrase):

           # geli init /dev/da2
           Enter new passphrase:   (enter security officer's passphrase)
           Reenter new passphrase:
           # geli setkey -n 1 /dev/da2
           Enter passphrase:       (enter security officer's passphrase)
           Enter new passphrase:   (let your employee enter his passphrase ...)
           Reenter new passphrase: (... twice)

     You are the security officer in your company.  Create an encrypted
     provider for use by the user, but remember that users forget their
     passphrases, so backup the Master Key with your own random key:

           # dd if=/dev/random of=/mnt/pendrive/keys/`hostname` bs=64 count=1
           # geli init -P -K /mnt/pendrive/keys/`hostname` /dev/ada0s1e
           # geli backup /dev/ada0s1e /mnt/pendrive/backups/`hostname`
           (use key number 0, so the encrypted Master Key will be re-encrypted by this)
           # geli setkey -n 0 -k /mnt/pendrive/keys/`hostname` /dev/ada0s1e
           (allow the user to enter his passphrase)
           Enter new passphrase:
           Reenter new passphrase:

     Encrypted swap partition setup:

           # dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/ada0s1b bs=1m
           # geli onetime -d -e 3des ada0s1b
           # swapon /dev/ada0s1b.eli

     The example below shows how to configure two providers which will be
     attached on boot, before the root filesystem is mounted.  One of them is
     using passphrase and three keyfile parts and the other is using only a
     keyfile in one part:

           # dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/da0 bs=1m
           # dd if=/dev/random of=/boot/keys/da0.key0 bs=32k count=1
           # dd if=/dev/random of=/boot/keys/da0.key1 bs=32k count=1
           # dd if=/dev/random of=/boot/keys/da0.key2 bs=32k count=1
           # geli init -b -K /boot/keys/da0.key0 -K /boot/keys/da0.key1 -K /boot/keys/da0.key2 da0
           Enter new passphrase:
           Reenter new passphrase:
           # dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/da1s3a bs=1m
           # dd if=/dev/random of=/boot/keys/da1s3a.key bs=128k count=1
           # geli init -b -P -K /boot/keys/da1s3a.key da1s3a

     The providers are initialized, now we have to add these lines to
     /boot/loader.conf:

           geli_da0_keyfile0_load="YES"
           geli_da0_keyfile0_type="da0:geli_keyfile0"
           geli_da0_keyfile0_name="/boot/keys/da0.key0"
           geli_da0_keyfile1_load="YES"
           geli_da0_keyfile1_type="da0:geli_keyfile1"
           geli_da0_keyfile1_name="/boot/keys/da0.key1"
           geli_da0_keyfile2_load="YES"
           geli_da0_keyfile2_type="da0:geli_keyfile2"
           geli_da0_keyfile2_name="/boot/keys/da0.key2"

           geli_da1s3a_keyfile0_load="YES"
           geli_da1s3a_keyfile0_type="da1s3a:geli_keyfile0"
           geli_da1s3a_keyfile0_name="/boot/keys/da1s3a.key"

     If there is only one keyfile, the index might be omitted:

           geli_da1s3a_keyfile_load="YES"
           geli_da1s3a_keyfile_type="da1s3a:geli_keyfile"
           geli_da1s3a_keyfile_name="/boot/keys/da1s3a.key"

     By convention, these loader variables are called geli_<device>_load.
     However, the actual name prefix before _load, _type, or _name does not
     matter.  At boot time, the geli module searches through all
     <prefix>_type-like variables that have a value of
     “<device>:geli_keyfile”.  The paths to keyfiles are then extracted from
     <prefix>_name variables.  In the example above, prefix is
     “geli_da1s3a_keyfile”.

     Not only configure encryption, but also data integrity verification using
     HMAC/SHA256.

           # geli init -a hmac/sha256 -s 4096 /dev/da0
           Enter new passphrase:
           Reenter new passphrase:
           # geli attach /dev/da0
           Enter passphrase:
           # dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/da0.eli bs=1m
           # newfs /dev/da0.eli
           # mount /dev/da0.eli /mnt/secret

     geli writes the metadata backup by default to the /var/backups/<prov>.eli
     file.  If the metadata is lost in any way (e.g., by accidental
     overwrite), it can be restored.  Consider the following situation:

           # geli init /dev/da0
           Enter new passphrase:
           Reenter new passphrase:

           Metadata backup can be found in /var/backups/da0.eli and
           can be restored with the following command:

                   # geli restore /var/backups/da0.eli /dev/da0

           # geli clear /dev/da0
           # geli attach /dev/da0
           geli: Cannot read metadata from /dev/da0: Invalid argument.
           # geli restore /var/backups/da0.eli /dev/da0
           # geli attach /dev/da0
           Enter passphrase:

     If an encrypted filesystem is extended, it is necessary to relocate and
     update the metadata:

           # gpart create -s GPT ada0
           # gpart add -s 1g -t freebsd-ufs -i 1 ada0
           # geli init -K keyfile -P ada0p1
           # gpart resize -s 2g -i 1 ada0
           # geli resize -s 1g ada0p1
           # geli attach -k keyfile -p ada0p1

     Initialize provider with the passphrase split into two files.  The
     provider can be attached using those two files or by entering “foobar” as
     the passphrase at the geli prompt:

           # echo foo > da0.pass0
           # echo bar > da0.pass1
           # geli init -J da0.pass0 -J da0.pass1 da0
           # geli attach -j da0.pass0 -j da0.pass1 da0
           # geli detach da0
           # geli attach da0
           Enter passphrase: foobar

     Suspend all geli devices on a laptop, suspend the laptop, then resume
     devices one by one after resuming the laptop:

           # geli suspend -a
           # zzz
           <resume your laptop>
           # geli resume -p -k keyfile gpt/secret
           # geli resume gpt/private
           Enter passphrase:

     To create a geli encrypted filesystem with a file as storage device
     follow this example.  First a file named private0 is created in /usr and
     attached as a memory disk like /dev/md0 for example.

           # dd if=/dev/zero of=/usr/private0 bs=1m count=256
           # chmod 0600 /usr/private0
           # mdconfig -t vnode -f /usr/private0

     It is recommended to place the following line in rc.conf(5) to have the
     memory disk automatically created during boot.

           mdconfig_md0="-t vnode -f /usr/private0"

     After /dev/md0 is created a random key has to be generated and stored in
     a secure location, like /root for example.  This key should be protected
     by a passphrase, which is requested when geli init is called.

           # dd if=/dev/random of=/root/private0.key bs=64 count=1
           # geli init -K /root/private0.key -s 4096 /dev/md0
           Enter new passphrase:
           Reenter new passphrase:
           # geli attach -k /root/private0.key /dev/md0
           Enter passphrase:
           # dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/md0.eli bs=1m

     Once the initialization of the /dev/md0.eli device is ready create a UFS
     filesystem and mount it for example in /private.

           # newfs /dev/md0.eli
           # mount /dev/md0.eli /private

     After a system reboot the geli device can be mounted again with the
     following commands.  The call of geli attach will ask for the passphrase.
     It is recommended to do this procedure after the boot, because otherwise
     the boot process would be waiting for the passphrase input.

           # geli attach -k /root/private0.key /dev/md0
           Enter passphrase:
           # mount /dev/md0.eli /private

ENCRYPTION MODES
     geli supports two encryption modes: XTS, which was standardized as IEEE
     P1619 and CBC with unpredictable IV.  The CBC mode used by geli is very
     similar to the mode ESSIV.

DATA AUTHENTICATION
     geli can verify data integrity when an authentication algorithm is
     specified.  When data corruption/modification is detected, geli will not
     return any data, but instead will return an error (EINVAL).  The offset
     and size of the corrupted data will be printed on the console.  It is
     important to know against which attacks geli provides protection for your
     data.  If data is modified in-place or copied from one place on the disk
     to another even without modification, geli should be able to detect such
     a change.  If an attacker can remember the encrypted data, he can
     overwrite any future changes with the data he owns without it being
     noticed.  In other words geli will not protect your data against replay
     attacks.

     It is recommended to write to the whole provider before first use, in
     order to make sure that all sectors and their corresponding checksums are
     properly initialized into a consistent state.  One can safely ignore data
     authentication errors that occur immediately after the first time a
     provider is attached and before it is initialized in this way.
