CATOD( )                                                              CATOD( )

NAME
       catod - To convert the text format of a dictionary to binary
               format.

SYNOPSIS
       catod  [-s maxword ] [-R] [-r] [-e] [-S] [-U]
              [-P dicpasswd ]    [-p frepasswd ]
              [-h cixingfile ] outfilename

DEFAULT PATH
       /usr/local/bin/cWnn4/catod

DESCRIPTION
       This command converts a dictionary from text format into binary format.

       outfilename is the name of the binary format dictionary.  If
       outfilename is not given, the output will be passed to the standard
       output device(stdout).

       The input file may be piped in by using the "<" command.  For example,
            catod  basic.dic  <  basic.u
       "basic.dic" here is the output binary format dictionary, while the
       "basic.u" is the input text format dictionary.

       If the input text dictionary is not given, the input will be taken from
       the standard input(stdin).  To end the input via standard input, press
       ^D.

OPTIONS
       -s     maxword
              To specify the maximum number of words.  Default is 70000.

       -R     To create a dictionary for both forward and reverse conversion.
              (Default).

       -r     To create a reverse format dictionary only for reverse
              conversion.

       -e     If the Hanzi inside the text dictionary contains characters such
              as space and tab, they will be compacted to special format.
              (Default).

       -S     To create a static dictionary.

       -U     To create a dynamic dictionary.

       -P     dicpasswd
              To specify the password for the dictionary.
              If "-N" is used instead, the password of the dictionary will be
              set to "*".

       -p     frepasswd
              To specify the password for the usage frequency file.
              If "-n" is used instead, the password of the frequency file will
              be set to "*".

       -h     cixingfile
              To specify the Cixing definition file.
