POLYGRAPH-AKA(1)                 User Commands                POLYGRAPH-AKA(1)

NAME
       polygraph-aka - IP aliases manipulation tool

SYNOPSIS
       aka [--option ...] [interface_name] [alias] ...

DESCRIPTION
       Aka is used to setup large number of aliases during Polygraph
       experiments with many robots and servers.

       The aliases option specifies what alias or aliases you want to have on
       the given interface. Aka recognizes IP addresses in PGL address format,
       including dotted IP range. Aka will try to guess the subnet or you can
       use an explicit subnet specification.

       The number of aliases you can set depends on your OS. Moreover, some
       OSes may support large number of aliases (more than 1000) but with a
       significant performance penalty.

       Note that you can just put alias specs after all other options and the
       interface name (see aka's usage line).

       Aka will delete all old aliases before setting new ones. If you do not
       specify the new aliases, the old ones will still be deleted (handy for
       cleaning up after yourself).

OPTIONS
       --help list of options
