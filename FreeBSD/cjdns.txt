NAME
       cjdroute.conf - Cjdns configuration file


DESCRIPTION
       The cjdroute.conf file configures the cjdns routing engine, cjdns(8),
       generally through cjdroute(1).

       The configuration is written in a variation of the JSON format that
       also accepts traditional C-like comments such as single line comments
       (//) and multiline comments (/* and */). Additionally, unused JSON
       values found in cjdroute.conf are ignored by cjdns and can be used as a
       form of JSON-compliant comments.


CONFIGURATION
       "privateKey": "..."
           Your node's private key. It should be kept secret because your
           confidentiality and data integrity depend on it.

       "publicKey": "..."
           Your node's public key. Based on your private key It is fine for
           anyone to know this.

       "ipv6": "..."
           Your node's IPv6 address when it is on the network. It is generated
           by using the first 16 bytes of a double SHA-512 of your public key.
           All cjdns IPv6 addresses must begin with "fc" or else they are
           invalid.

       "authorizedPasswords": [...]
           An array of passwords that may be used to connect (peer) to your
           node.

           "password": "..."
               A password which can be used to peer with your node.

           "user": "..."
               A human-readable string that identifies what password a peer is
               using on the admin interface. If omitted, the password will be
               identified by its position within the array (starting from 0)

           Example:
           "authorizedPasswords":
           [
               { "password": "AnExamplePassword", "user": "Bob" },
               { "password": "YetAnotherExample", "user": "Alice" },
               { "password": "j3fus4r3gkhv80xdz1yqc0qvn1p91hr", "user": "Eve"
           }
           ]

       "admin": {...}
           An object which defines where to bind to the admin RPC server as
           well as the password for the admin RPC server. The two required
           strings are "bind", which should be in the format "IP:PORT", and
           "password", which should preferably be a long random string of
           characters.

       "interfaces": {...}
           An object that defines which interfaces cjdns will bind to and what
           peers to connect to. There are two different interfaces,
           UDPInterface and ETHInterface, both of which are arrays. Within
           each array there are a variety of different options

           "bind": "..."
               Defines what the interface should bind to. In UDPInterface, the
               bind is an IP:PORT string, such as "0.0.0.0:12345", while in
               ETHInterface the bind is a network interface, such as "eth0".

           "beacon": Integer
               This option is only found in ETHInterface and defines whether
               auto-connecting beacons should be sent or listened to. This is
               useful for a zeroconf local network.

                   0 -- Disabled.
                   1 -- Accept incoming beacons and try connecting to the
                   sender.
                   2 -- Accept incoming beacons and broadcast beacons to the
                   local network.

           "connectTo": {...}
               Defines which nodes cjdns should connect to with the specified
               interface.  Multiple nodes may be placed in a single
               "connectTo" as long as each are seperated by commas. If a node
               happens to be offline or become offline during runtime, cjdns
               will attempt to reconnect at regular intervals. The one
               difference in this option between UDPInterface and ETHInterface
               is that UDPInterface connects to an "IP:PORT" while
               ETHInterface connects to a MAC address.

               UDPInterface Example:
               "connectTo":
               {
                   "1.2.3.4:54321":
                   {
                       "login": "login From Your Peer's authorizedPasswords",
                       "password": "password From Your Peer's
                   authorizedPasswords",
                       "publicKey": "Your Peer's publicKey.k"
                   },
                   "5.6.7.8:46321":
                   {
                       "login": "cueball",
                       "password": "Correct Horse Battery Staple",
                       "publicKey": "Other Peer's publicKey.k"
                   }
               }

       "router": {...}
           An object that holds configuration information on the router

           "interface": {...}
               Defines the type of interface used for connecting to the cjdns
               network.  It requires a "type" string, and optionally a
               "tunDevice" string. The "type" string defines the type of
               interface used, however only "TUNInterface" is supported at the
               moment. The "tunDevice" string defines the name of a persistent
               TUN device to use, which is helpful for starting cjdroute as
               its own user instead of root.

           "ipTunnel": {...}
               A system for tunneling ICANN IPv4 and ICANN IPv6 through cjdns.
               This is using the cjdns switch layer as a VPN carrier.

               NOTE: Simply editing your configuration file is not sufficient
               to setting up an ipTunnel gateway. Please read through
               tunnel/README.md in the cjdns git tree for more information

               "allowedConnections": [...]
                   Nodes allowed to connect to us, specified by their public
                   key, and what IP address(es) to give them. It is fine to
                   only specify one address.

                   Example:

                   "allowedConnections":
                   [
                       {
                           "publicKey":
                   "f64hfl7c4uxt6krmhPutTheRealAddressOfANodeHere7kfm5m0.k",
                           "ip4Address": "192.168.1.24",
                           "ip4Prefix": 24,
                           "ip6Address": "2001:123:ab::10",
                           "ip6Prefix": 0
                       },
                       {
                           "publicKey":
                   "ydq8csdk8p8ThisIsJustAnExampleAddresstxuyqdf27hvn2z0.k",
                           "ip4Address": "192.168.1.25",
                           "ip4Prefix": 24
                       }
                   ]

               "outgoingConnections": [...]
                   An array of nodes to connect and ask for IP addresses.

                   Example:

                   "outgoingConnections":
                   [
                       "6743gf5tw80ExampleExampleExampleExamplevlyb23zfnuzv0.k",
                       "pw9tfmr8pcrExampleExampleExampleExample8rhg1pgwpwf80.k",
                       "g91lxyxhq0kExampleExampleExampleExample6t0mknuhw75l0.k"
                   ]


       "security": [...]
           An array that defines what user to change to after startup and
           whether to exempt the Angel process from this user change.

           "setuser": "username"
               User to switch to after startup, for security purposes. Default
               value is "nobody".

           "exemptAngel": Integer
               Whether or not to exempt the Angel process from the user
               change. The Angel is a small isolated piece of code which
               exists outside of the core's strict sandbox but does not handle
               network traffic. This option must be enabled for ipTunnel to
               automatically set IP addresses for the TUN device.

               0 -- False
               1 -- True

       "logging": {...}
           Add or uncomment "logTo":"stdout" to have cjdns log to stdout
           rather than making logs available via the admin socket

       "noBackground": Integer
           If set to a non-zero value, cjdns will not fork to the background.
           Recommended for use in conjunction with "logTo":"stdout".

       "dns": {...}
           This section is used to configure the dns capabilities being added
           to cjdns.  Unfortunetly, there is no documentation for this DNS
           section at this time.

           "keys": [...]

           "servers": [...]

           "MinSignatures": Integer
