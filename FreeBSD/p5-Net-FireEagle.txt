SYNOPSIS
           # Set up Fire Eagle oauth
           my $fe  = Net::FireEagle->new( consumer_key    => $consumer_key,
                                          consumer_secret => $consumer_secret );

           # Resume previous Fire Eagle oauth, feed access token and secret
           my $fe2 = Net::FireEagle->new( consumer_key        => $consumer_key,
                                          consumer_secret     => $consumer_secret,

           # Send this to user to grant authorization for this app
           my $auth_url = $fe->get_authorization_url;
           # ... and request an access token
           # Note: you can save these in DB to restore previous Fire Eagle oauth session
           my ($access_token, $access_token_secret) = $fe->request_access_token;

           # Get them back
           my $access_token = $fe->access_token;
           my $access_token_secret = $fe->access_token_secret;

           # in the case of a web app, you want to save the request tokens
           # (and/or set them)
           my $request_token = $fe->request_token;
           my $request_token_secret = $fe->request_token_secret;

           my $loc = $fe->location( format => 'xml'  ); # returns xml
           my $loc = $fe->location( format => 'json' ); # returns json

           # returns result on success. dies or returns undef on failure
           my $return = $fe->update_location( "500 Third St., San Francisco, CA" );

           # Find a location. Returns either xml or json

ABOUT
       Fire Eagle is a site that stores information about your location. With
       your permission, other services and devices can either update that
       information or access it. By helping applications respond to your
       location, Fire Eagle is designed to make the world around you more
       interesting! Use your location to power friend-finders, games, local
       information services, blog badges and stuff like that...

       For more information see http://fireeagle.yahoo.net/

AUTHENTICATION
       For more information read this

           http://fireeagle.yahoo.net/developer/documentation/getting_started

       but, in short you have to first get an API key from the FireEagle site.
       Then using this consumer key and consumer secret you have to
       authenticate the relationship between you and your user. See the script
       "fireagle" packaged with this module for an example of how to do this.

SIMPLE DAILY USAGE AND EXAMPLE CODE
       The script "fireeagle" shipped with this module gives you really quick
       access to your FireEagle account - you can use it to simply query and
       update your location.

       It also serves as a pretty good example of how to do desktop app
       authentication and how to use the API.

METHODS
   new <opts>
       Create a new FireEagle object. This must have the options

       consumer_key
       consumer_secret

       which you can get at http://fireeagle.yahoo.net/developer/manage

       then, when you have your per-user authentication tokens (see above) you
       can supply

       access_token
       access_token_secret

       Alternatively when you create a new web-based application, a general-
       purpose access token is issued to you along with your application key
       and secret. You can get them at
       http://fireeagle.yahoo.net/developer/manage.

       They are tied to your application and allow your application to make
       general-purpose API method calls (often batch-style) to Fire Eagle.

       You can read about them at

           http://fireagle.yahoo.net/developer/documentation/using_oauth#feaccesstokens

       You can pass them in using the param

       general_token
       general_token_secret

   location [opt[s]
       Get the user's current location.

       Options are passed in as a hash and may be one of

       format
           Either 'xml' or 'json'. Defaults to 'xml'.

   update_location <location> <opt[s]>
       Takes a free form string with the new location.

       Return the result of the update in either xml or json depending on
       "opts".

       The location can either be a plain string or a hash reference
       containing location parameters as described in

           http://fireeagle.yahoo.net/developer/documentation/location#locparams

   lookup_location <query> <opt[s]>
       Disambiguates potential values for update. Results from lookup can be
       passed to update to ensure that Fire Eagle will understand how to parse
       the location parameter.

       Return the result of the update in either xml or json depending on
       "opts".

       The query can either be a plain string or a hash reference containing
       location parameters as described in

           http://fireeagle.yahoo.net/developer/documentation/location#locparams

   within <query> <opt[s]>
       Takes a Place ID or a WoE ID and returns a list of users using your
       application who are within the bounding box of that location.

       Return the result of the update in either xml or json depending on
       "opts".

       The query can either be a plain string or a hash reference containing
       location parameters as described in

           http://fireeagle.yahoo.net/developer/documentation/location#locparams

   recent <query> [opt[s]]
       Query for users of an Application who have updated their locations
       recently.

       Return the result of the update in either xml or json depending on
       "opts".

       Query is either a number representing a unix time stamp, to specify the
       earliest update to return, or a hash reference containing parameters as
       described in

           http://fireagle.yahoo.net/developer/documentation/querying#recent
