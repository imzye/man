DESCRIPTION
       This modules exports the needed subtypes, and coercions for POEx
       modules and is based on Sub::Exporter, so see that module for options
       on importing.

TYPES
   Kernel
       A subtype for POE::Kernel.

   Driver
       A subtype for POE::Driver.

   Session
       This sets an isa constraint on POE::Session

   SessionID
       Session IDs in POE are represented as positive integers and this Type
       constrains as such

   SessionAlias
       Session aliases are strings in and this is simply an alias for Str

   DoesSessionInstantiation
       This sets a constraint for an object that does
       POEx::Role::SessionInstantiation

   SessionRefIdAliasInstantiation
       This is a convience type that checks for the above types in one go.

   WheelID
       WheelIDs are represented as positive integers

COERCIONS
   SessionID
       You can coerce SessionAlias, Session, and DoesSessionInstantiation to a
       SessionID (via to_SessionID)

   SessionAlias
       You can also coerce a SessionAlias from a SessionID, Session, or
       DoesSessionInstantiation (via to_SessionAlias)

   Session
       And finally a Session can be coerced from a SessionID, or SessionAlias
       (via to_Session)
