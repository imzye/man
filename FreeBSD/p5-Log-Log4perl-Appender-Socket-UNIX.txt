Appender::Socket::UNIX(3)                  User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Log::Log4perl::Appender::Socket::UNIX- Log to a Unix Domain Socket

SYNOPSIS
               use Log::Log4perl::Appender::Socket::UNIX;

               my $appender = Log::Log4perl::Appender::Socket::UNIX->new(
                       Socket => '/var/tmp/myprogram.sock'
               );

               $appender->log(message => "Log me\n");

DESCRIPTION
       This is a simple appender for writing to a unix domain socket. It
       relies on Socket and only logs to an existing socket - ie. very useful
       to always log debug streams to the socket.

       The appender tries to stream to a socket. The socket in questions is
       beeing created by the client who wants to listen, once created the
       messages are coming thru.

EXAMPLE
       Write a client quickly using the Socket module:

               use Socket;

               my $s = "/var/tmp/myprogram.sock";

               unlink($s) or die("Failed to unlin socket - check permissions.\n");

               # be sure to set a correct umask so that the appender is allowed to stream to:
               # umask(000);

               socket(my $socket, PF_UNIX, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);
               bind($socket, sockaddr_un($s));

               while (1) {
                       while ($line = <$socket>) {
                               print $line;
                       }
               }
