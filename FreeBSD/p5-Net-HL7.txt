NAME
       Net::HL7

DESCRIPTION
       The Net-HL7 package is a simple Perl API for creating, parsing sending
       and receiving HL7 messages. To create an empty HL7 message object, do:

       and add segments like:

       For details, please consult the man pages of each specific class, or
       consult the generated API docs on http://hl7toolkit.sourceforge.net/.
       You might also check the test files in the 't' directory for examples.

       The Net::HL7 class is only used for documentation purposes (the stuff
       you're reading right now), to set HL7 configuration properties such as
       control characters on a global level and to provide a version number of
       the package to the Perl installation process. This can be used in a
       'require' statement, or to create a dependency from another Perl
       package.

PROPERTIES
       Some HL7 properties may be altered on a global level. Altering the
       variable makes it changed for this remainder of the lifetime of this
       Perl process. All HL7 messages will use the values provided here,
       unless something is changed in the MSH segment concerning these
       properties.

       SEGMENT_SEPARATOR
           Separator for segments within a message. Usually this is \015.

       FIELD_SEPARATOR
           Field separator for this message. In general '|' is used.

       NULL
           HL7 NULL field, defaults to "". This is therefore different from
           not setting the fields at all.

       COMPONENT_SEPARATOR
           Separator used in fields supporting components. Usually this is the
           '^' character.

       REPETITION_SEPARATOR
           Separator for fields that may be repeated. Defaults to '~'.

       ESCAPE_CHARACTER
           Escape character for escaping special characters. Defaults to '\'.

       SUBCOMPONENT_SEPARATOR
           Separator used in fields supporting subcomponents. Usually this is
           the '&' character.

       HL7_VERSION
           This is the version used in the MSH(12) field. Defaults to 2.2.
