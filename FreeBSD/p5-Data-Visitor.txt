VERSION
       version 0.32

SYNOPSIS
               # NOTE
               # You probably want to use Data::Visitor::Callback for trivial things

               package FooCounter;
               use Moose;

               extends qw(Data::Visitor);

               has number_of_foos => (
                       isa => "Int",
                       is  => "rw",
                       default => 0,
               );

               sub visit_value {
                       my ( $self, $data ) = @_;

                       if ( defined $data and $data eq "foo" ) {
                               $self->number_of_foos( $self->number_of_foos + 1 );
                       }

                       return $data;
               }

               my $counter = FooCounter->new;

               $counter->visit( {
                       this => "that",
                       some_foos => [ qw/foo foo bar foo/ ],
                       the_other => "foo",
               });

DESCRIPTION
       This module is a simple visitor implementation for Perl values.

       It has a main dispatcher method, "visit", which takes a single perl
       value and then calls the methods appropriate for that value.

       It can recursively map (cloning as necessary) or just traverse most
       structures, with support for per object behavior, circular structures,
       visiting tied structures, and all ref types (hashes, arrays, scalars,
       code, globs).

       Data::Visitor is meant to be subclassed, but also ships with a callback
       driven subclass, Data::Visitor::Callback.

METHODS
       visit $data
           This method takes any Perl value as its only argument, and
           dispatches to the various other visiting methods using
           "visit_no_rec_check", based on the data's type.

           If the value is a reference and has already been seen then
           "visit_seen" is called.

       visit_seen $data, $first_result
           When an already seen value is encountered again, it is typically
           replaced with the result of the first visitation of that value. The
           value and the result of the first visitation are passed as
           arguments.

           Returns $first_result.

       visit_no_rec_check $data
           Called for any value that has not yet been seen. Does the actual
           type based dispatch for "visit".

           Should not be called directly unless forcing a circular structure
           to be unfolded. Use with caution as this may cause infinite
           recursion.

       visit_object $object
           If the value is a blessed object, "visit" calls this method. The
           base implementation will just forward to "visit_value".

       visit_ref $value
           Generic recursive visitor. All non blessed values are given to
           this.

           "visit_object" can delegate to this method in order to visit the
           object anyway.

           This will check if the visitor can handle "visit_$reftype"
           (lowercase), and if not delegate to "visit_value" instead.

       visit_array $array_ref
       visit_hash $hash_ref
       visit_glob $glob_ref
       visit_code $code_ref
       visit_scalar $scalar_ref
           These methods are called for the corresponding container type.

       visit_value $value
           If the value is anything else, this method is called. The base
           implementation will return $value.

       visit_hash_entries $hash
       visit_hash_entry $key, $value, $hash
           Delegates to "visit_hash_key" and "visit_hash_value". The value is
           passed as $_[2] so that it is aliased.

       visit_hash_key $key, $value, $hash
           Calls "visit" on the key and returns it.

       visit_hash_value $value, $key, $hash
           The value will be aliased (passed as $_[1]).

       visit_array_entries $array
       visit_array_entry $value, $index, $array
           Delegates to "visit" on value. The value is passed as $_[1] to
           retain aliasing.

       visit_tied $object, $var
           When "tied_as_objects" is enabled and a tied variable (hash, array,
           glob or scalar) is encountered this method will be called on the
           tied object. If a valid mapped value is returned, the newly
           constructed result container will be tied to the return value and
           no iteration of the contents of the data will be made (since all
           storage is delegated to the tied object).

           If a non blessed value is returned from "visit_tied" then the
           structure will be iterated normally, and the result container will
           not be tied at all.

           This is because tying to the same class and performing the tie
           operations will not yield the same results in many cases.

       retain_magic $orig, $copy
           Copies over magic from $orig to $copy.

           Currently only handles "bless". In the future this might be
           expanded using Variable::Magic but it isn't clear what the correct
           semantics for magic copying should be.

       trace
           Called if the "DEBUG" constant is set with a trace message.

RETURN VALUE
       This object can be used as an "fmap" of sorts - providing an ad-hoc
       functor interface for Perl data structures.

       In void context this functionality is ignored, but in any other context
       the default methods will all try to return a value of similar
       structure, with its children also fmapped.

SUBCLASSING
       Data::Visitor is a Moose class, so it should be subclassed using Moose.

       Then override the callback methods in any way you like. To retain
       visitor behavior, make sure to retain the functionality of
       "visit_array" and "visit_hash".

TODO
       •   Add support for "natural" visiting of trees.

       •   Expand "retain_magic" to support tying at the very least, or even
           more with Variable::Magic if possible.
