DWARF_ADD_FILE_DECL(3)                        FreeBSD Library Functions Manual

NAME
     dwarf_add_file_decl – add a source file entry to a producer instance

LIBRARY
     DWARF Access Library (libdwarf, -ldwarf)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <libdwarf.h>

     Dwarf_Unsigned
     dwarf_add_file_decl(Dwarf_P_Debug dbg, char *name, Dwarf_Unsigned dirndx,
         Dwarf_Unsigned mtime, Dwarf_Unsigned size, Dwarf_Error *err);

DESCRIPTION
     Function dwarf_add_file_decl() adds a source file entry to a producer
     instance.

     Argument dbg should reference a DWARF producer instance allocated using
     dwarf_producer_init(3) or dwarf_producer_init_b(3).

     Argument name should point to a NUL-terminated string containing the name
     of the source file.

     If the file name in argument name is not a fully qualified pathname,
     argument dirndx should specify the index of the directory where the
     source file resides.  Otherwise, argument dirndx should be 0.  Valid
     directory indices are those returned by the function
     dwarf_add_directory_decl(3).

     Argument mtime specifies the time when the file was last modified.

     Argument size specifies the size of the file in bytes.

     If argument err is not NULL, it will be used to store error information
     in case of an error.

RETURN VALUES
     On success, function dwarf_add_file_decl() returns the index value
     generated for the source file.  In case of an error, function
     dwarf_add_file_decl() returns DW_DLV_NOCOUNT and sets the argument err.

ERRORS
     Function dwarf_add_file_decl() can fail with:

     [DW_DLE_ARGUMENT]       Either arguments dbg or name was NULL.

     [DW_DLE_ARGUMENT]       The length of the NUL-teminated string pointed to
                             by argument name was 0.

     [DW_DLE_MEMORY]         An out of memory condition was encountered during
                             the execution of the function.
