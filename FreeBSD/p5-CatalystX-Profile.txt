CatalystX::Profile(3)                      User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       CatalystX::Profile - Profile your Catalyst application with
       Devel::NYTProf

VERSION
       version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
           # In MyApp.pm
           use Catalyst qw( +CatalystX::Profile );

           export NYTPROF=start=no
           perl -d:NYTProf script/myapp_server.pl

           ... click around on your website ...

           Finish profiling: /profile/stop_profiling

DESCRIPTION
       This (really basic for now) plugin adds support for profiling your
       Catalyst application, without profiling all the crap that happens
       during setup. This noise can make finding the real profiling stuff
       trickier, so profiling is disabled while this happens.

BUGS, WARNINGS, POTENTIAL HEALTH HAZARDS
       This module is really new - but it does do what it says on the tin so
       far. But I really need some feedback! Please submit all feature
       suggestions either on here via RT, or just poke me on irc.perl.org (I'm
       aCiD2).
