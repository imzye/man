NAME
       Text::Tabs - expand and unexpand tabs like unix expand(1) and
       unexpand(1)

SYNOPSIS
         use Text::Tabs;

         $tabstop = 4;  # default = 8
         @lines_without_tabs = expand(@lines_with_tabs);
         @lines_with_tabs = unexpand(@lines_without_tabs);

DESCRIPTION
       Text::Tabs does most of what the unix utilities expand(1) and
       unexpand(1) do.  Given a line with tabs in it, "expand" replaces those
       tabs with the appropriate number of spaces.  Given a line with or
       without tabs in it, "unexpand" adds tabs when it can save bytes by
       doing so, like the "unexpand -a" command.

       Unlike the old unix utilities, this module correctly accounts for any
       Unicode combining characters (such as diacriticals) that may occur in
       each line for both expansion and unexpansion.  These are overstrike
       characters that do not increment the logical position.  Make sure you
       have the appropriate Unicode settings enabled.

EXPORTS
       The following are exported:

       expand
       unexpand
       $tabstop
           The $tabstop variable controls how many column positions apart each
           tabstop is.  The default is 8.

           Please note that local($tabstop) doesn't do the right thing and if
           you want to use "local" to override $tabstop, you need to use
           local($Text::Tabs::tabstop).

EXAMPLE
         #!perl
         # unexpand -a
         use Text::Tabs;

         while (<>) {
           print unexpand $_;
         }

       Instead of the shell's "expand" command, use:

         perl -MText::Tabs -n -e 'print expand $_'

       Instead of the shell's "unexpand -a" command, use:

         perl -MText::Tabs -n -e 'print unexpand $_'

BUGS
       Text::Tabs handles only tabs ("\t") and combining characters ("/\pM/").
       It doesn't count backwards for backspaces ("\t"), omit other non-
       printing control characters ("/\pC/"), or otherwise deal with any other
       zero-, half-, and full-width characters.
