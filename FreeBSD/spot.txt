NAME
       autcross - cross-compare tools that process automata

SYNOPSIS
       autcross [OPTION...] [COMMANDFMT...]

DESCRIPTION
       Call several tools that process automata and cross-compare their output
       to detect bugs, or to gather statistics.  The list of automata to use
       should be supplied on standard input, or using the -F option.

   Input:
       -F, --file=FILENAME
              process automata from FILENAME

   Specifying tools to call:
       --list-shorthands
              list availabled shorthands to use in COMMANDFMT

       -t, --tool=COMMANDFMT
              register one tool to call

       -T, --timeout=NUMBER
              kill tools after NUMBER seconds

       COMMANDFMT should specify input and output arguments using the
       following character sequences:

       %%     a single %

       %H,%S,%L
              filename for the input automaton in (H) HOA, (S) Spin's
              neverclaim, or (L) LBTT's format

       %M, %[val]M
              the name of the input automaton, with an optional default value

       %O     filename for the automaton output in HOA, never claim, LBTT, or
              ltl2dstar's format

   Parsing of automata:
       --trust-hoa=BOOL
              If false, properties listed in HOA files are ignored, unless
              they can be easily verified.  If true (the default) any
              supported property is trusted.

   autcross behavior:
       --fail-on-timeout
              consider timeouts as errors

       --ignore-execution-failures
              ignore automata from translators that return with a non-zero
              exit code, but do not flag this as an error

       --language-complemented
              expect that each tool complements the input language

       --language-preserved
              expect that each tool preserves the input language

       --no-checks
              do not perform any sanity checks

       --stop-on-error
              stop on first execution error or failure to pass sanity checks
              (timeouts are OK)

   Statistics output:
       --csv[=[>>]FILENAME]
              output statistics as CSV in FILENAME or on standard output (if
              '>>' is used to request append mode, the header line is not
              output)

       --omit-missing
              do not output statistics for timeouts or failed translations

   Simplification level (for complementation):
       --high all available optimizations (slow, default)

       --low  minimal optimizations (fast)

       --medium
              moderate optimizations

   Output options:
       --color[=WHEN]
              colorize output; WHEN can be 'never', 'always' (the default if
              --color is used without argument), or 'auto' (the default if
              --color is not used)

       -q, --quiet
              suppress all normal output in absence of errors

       --save-bogus=[>>]FILENAME
              save automata for which problems were detected in FILENAME

       --verbose
              print what is being done, for debugging

       If an output FILENAME is prefixed with '>>', it is open in append mode
       instead of being truncated.

   Miscellaneous options:
       --help print this help

       --version
              print program version

       Mandatory or optional arguments to long options are also mandatory or
       optional for any corresponding short options.

   Exit status:
       0      everything went fine (without --fail-on-timeout, timeouts are
              OK)

       1      some tools failed to output something we understand, or failed
              sanity checks (statistics were output nonetheless)

       2      autcross aborted on error

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       SPOT_TMPDIR, TMPDIR
              These variables control in which directory temporary files
              (e.g., those who contain the input and output when interfacing
              with translators) are created.  TMPDIR is only read if
              SPOT_TMPDIR does not exist.  If none of these environment
              variables exist, or if their value is empty, files are created
              in the current directory.

       SPOT_TMPKEEP
              When this variable is defined, temporary files are not removed.
              This is mostly useful for debugging.

OUTPUT DATA
       The following columns are output in the CSV files.

       input.source
              Location of the input automaton fed to the tool.

       input.name
              Name of the input automaton, if any.  This is supported by the
              HOA format.

       input.ap,output.ap,
              Number of atomic proposition in the input and output automata.

       input.states,output.states
              Number of states in the input and output automata.

       input.edges,output.edges
              Number of edges in the input and output automata.

       input.transitions,output.transitions
              Number of transitions in the input and output automata.

       input.acc_sets,output.acc_sets
              Number of acceptance sets in the input and output automata.

       input.scc,output.scc
              Number of strongly connected components in the input and output
              automata.

       input.nondetstates,output.nondetstates
              Number of nondeterministic states in the input and output
              automata.

       input.nondeterministic,output.nondetstates
              1 if the automaton is nondeterministic, 0 if it is
              deterministic.

       input.alternating,output.alternating
              1 if the automaton has some universal branching, 0 otherwise.

              exit_status, exit_code Information about how the execution of
              the tool went.  exit_status is a string that can take the
              following values:

              "ok"   The tool ran succesfully (this does not imply that the
                     produced automaton is correct) and autcross could parse
                     the resulting automaton.  In this case exit_code is
                     always 0.

              "timeout"
                     The tool ran for more than the number of seconds
                     specified with the --timeout option.  In this case
                     exit_code is always -1.

              "exit code"
                     The tool terminated with a non-zero exit code.  exit_code
                     contains that value.

              "signal"
                     The tool terminated with a signal.  exit_code contains
                     that signal's number.

              "parse error"
                     The tool terminated normally, but autcross could not
                     parse its output.  In this case exit_code is always -1.

              "no output"
                     The tool terminated normally, but without creating the
                     specified output file.  In this case exit_code is always
                     -1.

       time   A floating point number giving the run time of the tool in
              seconds.  This is reported for all executions, even failling
              ones.
