DISCUS(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              DISCUS(1)

NAME
       discus - print a report of disk space usage

SYNOPSIS
       discus [options]

DESCRIPTION
       discus aims to make df(1) prettier. Features include color, bar graphs,
       and smart formatting of numbers (automatically choosing the most
       suitable size from kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, or terabytes). Or
       choose your own size, along with specifying the number of decimal
       places you'd like to see. You may also copy
       /usr/local/etc/discus/discusrc to $HOME/.discusrc and customize things
       to your preference.

       -d     Display device names instead of graphs.

       -p     Number of digits to right of decimal place.

       -t, -g, -m, -k
              Display sizes in terabytes, gigabytes, megabytes, or kilobytes,
              respectively.  Assumes -s.

       -v, --version
              Show version of program.

       -r     Takes into account even the reserved space to root; it will be
