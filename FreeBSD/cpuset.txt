DESCRIPTION
     The cpuset command can be used to assign processor sets to processes, run
     commands constrained to a given set or list of processors and memory
     domains, and query information about processor binding, memory binding
     and policy, sets, and available processors and memory domains in the
     system.

     cpuset requires a target to modify or query.  The target may be specified
     as a command, process id, thread id, a cpuset id, an irq, a jail, or a
     NUMA domain.  Using -g the target's set id or mask may be queried.  Using
     -l or -s the target's CPU mask or set id may be set.  If no target is
     specified, cpuset operates on itself.  Not all combinations of operations
     and targets are supported.  For example, you may not set the id of an
     existing set or query and launch a command at the same time.

     There are two sets applicable to each process and one private mask per
     thread.  Every process in the system belongs to a cpuset.  By default
     processes are started in set 1.  The mask or id may be queried using -c.
     Each thread also has a private mask of CPUs it is allowed to run on that
     must be a subset of the assigned set.  And finally, there is a root set,
     numbered 0, that is immutable.  This last set is the list of all possible
     CPUs in the system and is queried using -r.

     Most sets include NUMA memory domain and policy information.  This can be
     inspected with -g and set with -n.  This will specify which NUMA domains
     are visible to the process and affect where anonymous memory and file
     pages will be stored on first access.  Files accessed first by other
     processes may specify conflicting policy.

     When running a command it may join a set specified with -s otherwise a
     new set is created.  In addition, a mask for the command may be specified
     using -l.  When used in conjunction with -c the mask modifies the
     supplied or created set rather than the private mask for the thread.

     The options are as follows:

     -C                 Create a new cpuset and assign the target process to
                        that set.

     -c                 The requested operation should reference the cpuset
                        available via the target specifier.

     -d domain          Specifies a NUMA domain id as the target of the
                        operation.  This can only be used to query the cpus
                        visible in each numberd domain.

     -g                 Causes cpuset to print either a list of valid CPUs or,
                        using -i, the id of the target.

     -i                 When used with the -g option print the id rather than
                        the valid mask of the target.

     -j jail            Specifies a jail id or name as the target of the
                        operation.

     -l cpu-list        Specifies a list of CPUs to apply to a target.
                        Specification may include numbers separated by '-' for
                        ranges and commas separating individual numbers.  A
                        special list of “all” may be specified in which case
                        the list includes all CPUs from the root set.

     -n policy:domain-list
                        Specifies a list of domains and allocation policy to
                        apply to a target.  Ranges may be specified as in -l.
                        Valid policies include first-touch (ft), round-robin
                        (rr), prefer and interleave (il).  First-touch
                        allocates on the local domain when memory is
                        available.  Round-robin alternates between every
                        possible domain page at at time.  The prefer policy
                        accepts only a single domain in the set.  The parent
                        of the set is consulted if the preferred domain is
                        unavailable.  Interleave operates like round-robin
                        with an implementation defined stripe width.  See
                        domainset(9) for more details on policies.

     -p pid             Specifies a pid as the target of the operation.

     -s setid           Specifies a set id as the target of the operation.

     -r                 The requested operation should reference the root set
                        available via the target specifier.

     -t tid             Specifies a thread id as the target of the operation.

     -x irq             Specifies an irq as the target of the operation.

EXIT STATUS
     The cpuset utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Create a new group with CPUs 0-4 inclusive and run /bin/sh on it:
           cpuset -c -l 0-4 /bin/sh

     Query the mask of CPUs the ⟨sh pid⟩ is allowed to run on:
           cpuset -g -p <sh pid>

     Restrict /bin/sh to run on CPUs 0 and 2 while its group is still allowed
     to run on CPUs 0-4:
           cpuset -l 0,2 -p <sh pid>

     Modify the cpuset /bin/sh belongs to restricting it to CPUs 0 and 2:
           cpuset -l 0,2 -c -p <sh pid>

     Modify the cpuset all threads are in by default to contain only the first
     4 CPUs, leaving the rest idle:
           cpuset -l 0-3 -s 1

     Print the id of the cpuset /bin/sh is in:
           cpuset -g -i -p <sh pid>

     Move the pid into the specified cpuset setid so it may be managed with
     other pids in that set:
           cpuset -s <setid> -p <pid>

     Create a new cpuset that is restricted to CPUs 0 and 2 and move pid into
     the new set:
           cpuset -C -c -l 0,2 -p <pid>
