DESCRIPTION
     dhex is a hex editor. It can be used to alter individual bytes in large
     files. Since it is a text-mode programm based on ncurses, it can run in
     numerous scenarios.  Its special feature is the diff mode: With it, the
     user has a visual tool for file comparison. This mode is invoked when
     dhex is called with two instead of one file as parameters.

OPTIONS
     All the options are case-insensitive and can be given as either upper- or
     lowercase characters.

     -ab -ad -ah -ao base address
                 After loading a file, every address gets a base address other
                 than 0. With this, it is easier to work on partial memory
                 dumps. The base address can be given as a binary one with
                 [-ab] , as a decimal one with [-ad] , as a hexadecimal one
                 with [-ah] or an octal with [-ao].

     -a1b -a1d -a1h -a1o base address 1

     -a2b -a2d -a2h -a2o base address 2
                 For the diff mode, it is possible to set two different base
                 addresses. Again, a binary address can be given as [-a1b
                 -a2b] , as decimal one with [-a1d -a2d] , as hexadecimal one
                 with [-a1h -a2h] or an octal one with [-a1o -a2o].

                 This base address is calculated into the marker files as well
                 as the searchlogs.

     -cb -cl     Diff mode only: The input files can be correlated from the
                 command line with the best -cb or longest -cl match. This is
                 very slow.

     -cd upper-limit
                 Diff mode only: The input files can be correlated from the
                 command line with the minimum difference. To improve the
                 correlation speed, an upper limit can be provided.

     -f configfile
                 Usually, .dhexrc is being read from the invoker's home
                 directory. With this parameter, any other config file can be
                 loaded. See dhexrc(5) for a description of its file format.

     -g          Shows the license

     -x          Starts the hexcal

     -h          Shows the help screen

     -k          Starts the keyboard setup manually before any file is being
                 loaded. This is very helpful when calling dhex from an exotic
                 terminal.

     -m markerfile
                 It is possible in dhex to set bookmarks and store them in a
                 markerfile for later use. With this parameter, the markerfile
                 is being read at start time, making it unnecesarry to read
                 them later through the gui. Their file format is described in
                 dhex_markers(5).

     -ob -od -oh -oo offset
                 After loading a file, the cursor is set to 0, and the first
                 page of bytes is being shown on the screen. With one of those
                 parameters it is possible to start at any other location in
                 the file. The cursorposition could be given as a binary
                 number with [-ob] , as a decimal one with [-od] , as a
                 hexadecimal one with [-oh] or an octal with [-oo].

     -o1b -o1d -o1h -o1o offset1

     -o2b -o2d -o2h -o2o offset2
                 For the diff mode, it is possible to set two different
                 cursorpositions at start time. Again, the cursorpositions can
                 be given as a binary number with [-o1b -o2b] , as decimal one
                 with [-o1d -o2d] , as hexadecimal one with [-o1h -o2h] or an
                 octal one with [-o1o -o2o].

                 This way, the first few bytes in a file can be skipped, and
                 just the rest can be compared.

     -r searchlog
                 When searching from the command line, the offsets are being
                 read from this searchlog. Its format is being decribed in
                 dhex_searchlog(5).

     -r1 searchlog1

     -r2 searchlog2
                 When searching in two files simultanously, the offsets can be
                 read from two different searchlogs.

     -sa -sab -sh -shb string
                 Instead of setting the cursor offset to an absolute value, it
                 is possible to search for a specific string from the command
                 line. If there is an additional [-ob -od -oh -oo offset]
                 present, the search will start there. It is possible to read
                 and write search logs with [-r searchlog] and [-w searchlog]
                 respectively. With [-sa string] is being interpreted as
                 ASCII.  [-sh string] interprets it as hex. For backwards
                 search, [-sab string] or [-shb string] can be applied.

     -s1a -s1ab -s1h -s1hb string1

     -s2a -s2ab -s2h -s2hb string2
                 In the diff mode, it is possible to search for two strings in
                 two files simultanously.

     -v          Prints out the version of dhex.

     -w searchlog
                 When searching from the command line, write the results into
                 this searchlog and quit. It is being written in the format
                 described in dhex_searchlog(5.)

     -w1 searchlog1

     -w2 searchlog2
                 When searching in two files simultanously, write the results
                 from both searches into those log files.

USER INTERFACE
   General
     Menus have hotkeys, they are being presented in a different color. To
     jump from one menu item to the next, the cursor keys or the TAB key can
     be used.

     Input fields can be closed by pressing ESC, ENTER, or any cursor key.
     Only pressing ESC will not save the changes made in there.

   The keyboard setup
     When running dhex for the first time, without any configfile present, or
     with the parameter -k, the first screen shown is that of the keyboard
     setup. In this screen, the program asks the user to press certain keys.
     Which are (in order) ESCAPE, F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6, F7, F8, F9, F10,
     BACKSPACE, DEL, ENTER, TAB, UP, DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT, PG UP, PG DOWN, HOME,
     END. It also tells the user what it intends to do with those keys later.
     So the user can decide on any alternative he chooses.  If he does not
     want to bind a specific function to a certain key, he can simply press
     ESCAPE and skip to the next question.

     After pressing all the keys, the user can chose whether or not to write
     those keys into the config file.

   The main screen
     The main screen is broken down into three columns: The first column
     contains the offset within the file for the current line. The second
     column contains the bytes in the file in hex format. Finally, the third
     coumn contains the same bytes, but this time in ascii format. If a byte
     is not printable, it is being substituted with a '.'.  How many bytes are
     are being shown in a line depends on the width of the terminal. For
     example, if the terminal is 80 characters wide, 16 bytes are being shown
     in each line.

     If no other [-o] or [-a] parameter was given at start time, the cursor is
     being set to offset 0. It is also being shown in the hex column. Here, it
     can be moved with the cursor keys. When entering a hexadecimal number,
     the file is being edited. The file can be edited in the ascii column as
     well, simply by pressing the TAB key (or whichever key was substituted
     for it in the keyboard setup). Pressing TAB again will return the cursor
     to the hex column. Pressing F9 (or its substitute) will undo the last of
     the changes. Changes are being shown in a differnt color.

     Editing is not possible in the diff mode. Here, pressing the cursor keys
     will move both files synchronously.

   The goto screen
     Pressing F1 (or its substitute) will open the Goto... screen. Here, it is
     possible to jump to a specific address directly, without the need of
     scrolling there with the cursor keys. The address can be entered in the
     'To' field, either absolute or relative (to leap over a specified amount
     of bytes). An absolute address is being chosen by pressing '=', and a
     relative one by pressing '+' or '-', for a positive or negative leap
     respectively. Regardless of the adressing mode, it has to be entered as a
     hexadecimal number.

     It is also possible to set up to ten bookmarks in this screen: Pressing
     '0'...'9' will select one of them. Moving the cursor to "Set" and
     pressing ENTER will alter one of those book marks. The "Diff:" fields are
     showing the difference between the actual cursor position and the
     bookmark.

     Bookmarks can be stored and loaded, for this there are the "Save Markers"
     and "Load Markers" items on the bottom. Upon selecting one of them, the
     user is being prompted for a filename. It is possible to load a marker
     file at start time, by providing the [-m markerfile] parameter.
     dhex_markers(5) describes the format of the marker files.

   Searching
     Pressing F2 (or its subsitute) will open the Search... screen. Here, a
     short string can be entered (either in hex, or in ascii). If no logfiles
     are being selected, the cursor will jump to the next occurance of this
     search string upon selection of "Go". It can be chosen if the search is
     supposed to be conducted forward of backwards.

     To jump to the next occurance, F3 (or its substitute) has to be pressed.
     To jump to the previous one, F4 has to be pressed. The search itself
     wraps at the edges of the file, meaning that when it reaches the end, it
     will start from the beginning and vice versa.

     Searchlogs are an advanced way of searching: Writing to the searchlog
     does not jump the cursor from one occurance to the next. Instead, it will
     write the offsets of all of them into the logfile. Their format is
     described in dhex_searchlog(5).

     Reading from this searchlog means that the search does not cover the
     whole file: Only the addresses which have been provided in this file are
     being searched. Thus it is possible to search for specific changes. Like
     for example the number of lives stored in the save file of a game.
     dhex_searchlog(5) describes the format of the searchlog.

   HexCal
     Pressing F5 (or its substitute) will open a small 64 bit calculator. This
     calculator is  capable of not only performing arithmetic operations (+,
     -, *, /, modulo), but also logic ones. (and, or, xor, shift). There are
     three columns to enter numbers as hexadecimals, decimals or in binary
     format. Pressing 'x' will close this screen. Using the command line
     argument [-x] will start it from the commandline.

   Correlation
     When dhex(1) is running in diff mode, pressing F6 (or its substitute)
     will open the dialog for file correlation. This will try to find the
     optimal offset between the two files. There are three algorithms
     available for finding this offset: Searching for the best match (as many
     bytes as possible are the same), the longest match (as many consecutive
     bytes match as possible), or the minimum difference (as little
     differences between the bytes as possible).

     Even though it seems like the same at first, looking for the minimum
     difference is in fact faster. This can be improved even more, if the user
     sets an upper difference limit.

     Upon selecting Go, the program will search for the optimal offset. This
     will take some time.

   Saving and quitting
     Pressing F10 (or its substitute) will close dhex.  In case there have
     been changes made to the file, a save dialog opens up. Here, it is
     possible to select whether or not to write the changes back into the
     file.

FILES
     $HOME/.dhexrc: The default location of the config file. If the $HOME-
     variable is not set, its location has to be provided manually.
