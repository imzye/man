XML::Filter::XInclude(3)                   User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       XML::Filter::XInclude - XInclude as a SAX Filter

SYNOPSIS
         use XML::SAX;
         use XML::SAX::Writer;
         use XML::Filter::XInclude;

         my $parser = XML::SAX::ParserFactory->parser(
             Handler => XML::Filter::XInclude->new(
                 Handler => XML::SAX::Writer->new()
             )
         );
         $parser->parse_uri("foo.xml");

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements a simple SAX filter that provides XInclude
       support. It does NOT support XPointer.

       XInclude is very simple, just include something like this in your XML
       document:

         <xi:include href="foo.xml"
           xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"/>

       And it will load foo.xml and parse it in the current SAX stream.

       If you specify the attribute parse="text", it will be treated as a
       plain text file, and inserted into the stream as a series of calls to
       the characters() method.

       URI's are supported via LWP.

       Currently encoding is not supported.
