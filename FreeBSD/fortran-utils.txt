FPR(1)                  FreeBSD General Commands Manual                 FPR(1)

NAME
     fpr – print Fortran file

SYNOPSIS
     fpr

DESCRIPTION
     Fpr is a filter that transforms files formatted according to Fortran's
     carriage control conventions into files formatted according to UNIX line
     printer conventions.

     Fpr copies its input onto its output, replacing the carriage control
     characters with characters that will produce the intended effects when
     printed using lpr(1).  The first character of each line determines the
     vertical spacing as follows:

           Blank        One line
           0            Two lines
           1            To first line of next page
           +            No advance

     A blank line is treated as if its first character is a blank. A blank
     that appears as a carriage control character is deleted. A zero is
     changed to a newline.  A one is changed to a form feed. The effects of a
     "+" are simulated using backspaces.

EXAMPLES
           a.out | fpr | lpr

           fpr < f77.output | lpr

HISTORY
     The fpr command appeared in 4.2BSD.

BUGS
     Results are undefined for input lines longer than 170 characters.
