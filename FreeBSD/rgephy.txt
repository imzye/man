RGEPHY(4)              FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual              RGEPHY(4)

NAME
     rgephy – RealTek RTL8168/8169/8110/8211 series 10/100/1000 Gigabit
     Ethernet PHY driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile all available PHY drivers into the kernel, place the following
     line in your kernel configuration file:

           device miibus

     Alternatively, to selectively compile this driver into the kernel, place
     the following lines in your kernel configuration file instead:

           device mii
           device rgephy

DESCRIPTION
     The rgephy driver supports the RealTek RTL8168, RTL8169, RTL8110 and
     RTL8211 series integrated 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet PHYs.

     In order to get a list of media types and options supported by a specific
     instance of the rgephy driver, run ifconfig -m on the instance of its
     parent MAC driver.

     Additionally, the rgephy driver supports the following special media
     option:

     flag0      When manually setting media type and options via ifconfig(8),
                the rgephy driver by default also triggers an autonegotiation
                advertising the selected media.  This is done in order to work
                around hardware issues in certain scenarios.  It is believed
                that this behavior does not cause harm in general but in fact
                can have an adverse effect in edge cases.  In order to
                manually set the media type and options without also
                triggering an autonegotiation, the rgephy driver allows to
                turn this behavior off via the flag0 media option.

     Note that this special media option will not show up in the output of
     ifconfig(8), even when set.

EXAMPLES
     Manually set 100BASE-TX full-duplex without also triggering an
     autonegotiation:

           ifconfig re0 media 100baseTX mediaopt full-duplex,flag0
