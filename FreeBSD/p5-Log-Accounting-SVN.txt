         my $acc = Log::Accounting::SVN->new(repository => 'svn://');

DESCRIPTION
       This module make use of Algorithm::Accounting and SVN::Log to do simple
       accounting of any subversion repository (not necessarily local, as long
       as you can do "svn log" to). The installed "svn-accounting.pl" script
       demostrate a simple use to this module, you may try:

         svn-accounting.pl http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/

       This will show the basic accounting information of subversion
       developers.

       So far it's quite simple and no big deal, different fields will be
       accounted in the future.
