DETOX(1)                FreeBSD General Commands Manual               DETOX(1)

NAME
     detox – clean up filenames

SYNOPSIS
     detox [-f configfile] [-n | --dry-run] [-r] [-s sequence] [--special]
           [-v] file ...
     detox [-L] [-f configfile] [-v]
     detox [-h | --help]
     detox [-V]

DESCRIPTION
     The detox utility renames files to make them easier to work with under
     Unix and Unix-like operating systems.  It replaces characters that make
     it hard to type out a filename with dashes and underscores.  It also
     provides transliteration-based filters, converting ISO 8859-1 or UTF-8 to
     ASCII, in part or in whole.  An additional filter unescapes CGI-escaped
     filenames.

   Sequences
     detox is driven by a configurable series of filters, called a sequence.
     Sequences are covered in more detail in detoxrc(5) and are discoverable
     with the -L option.  The default sequence will run the safe and wipeup
     filters.  Other examples of pre-configured sequences are iso8859_1 and
     utf_8, which both provide transliteration to ASCII and then finish with
     the safe and wipeup filters.

   Options
     -f configfile
                 Use configfile instead of the default configuration files for
                 loading translation sequences.  No other config file will be
                 parsed.

     -h, --help  Display helpful information.

     --inline    Run in inline mode.  See inline-detox(1) for more details.

     -L          List the currently available sequences.  When paired with -v
                 this option shows what filters are used in each sequence and
                 any properties applied to the filters.

     -n, --dry-run
                 Doesn't actually change anything.  This implies the -v
                 option.

     -r          Recurse into subdirectories.  Any file or directory that
                 starts with a period, such as .git/ or .cache/, will be
                 ignored during recursion unless specified on the command
                 line.  Also, any file or directory specified in the ignore
                 section of the config file will be ignored during recursion.

     -s sequence
                 Use sequence instead of default.

     --special   Works on special files (including links).  Normally detox
                 ignores these files.  detox will not recurse into symlinks
                 that point at directories.

     -v          Be verbose about which files are being renamed.

     -V          Show the current version of detox.

FILES
     /etc/detoxrc
                 The system-wide detoxrc file.

     ~/.detoxrc  A user's personal detoxrc.  Normally it extends the system-
                 wide detoxrc, unless -f has been specified, in which case, it
                 is ignored.

     /usr/share/detox/cp1252.tbl
                 The provided CP-1252 transliteration table.

     /usr/share/detox/iso8859_1.tbl
                 The provided ISO 8859-1 transliteration table.

     /usr/share/detox/safe.tbl
                 The provided safe character translation table.

     /usr/share/detox/unicode.tbl
                 The provided Unicode transliteration table, used by the UTF-8
                 filter.

     /usr/share/detox/unidecode.tbl
                 An additional Unicode tranlsiteration table, based on
                 Text::Unidecode(3pm).

EXAMPLES
     detox -s lower -r -v -n /tmp/new_files
                 Will run the sequence lower recursively, listing any changes,
                 without changing anything, on the files of /tmp/new_files.

     detox -f my_detoxrc -L -v
                 Will list the sequences within my_detoxrc, showing their
                 filters and options.

HISTORY
     detox was originally designed to clean up files that I had received from
     friends which had been created using other operating systems.  It's
     trivial to create a filename with spaces, parenthesis, brackets, and
     ampersands under some operating systems.  These have special meaning
     within FreeBSD and Linux, and cause problems when you go to access them.
     I created detox to clean up these files.

     Version 2.0 stepped back from transliteration out of the box, instead
     focusing on ease of use.  The primary motivations for this were user-
     provided feedback, and the fact that many modern Unix-like OSs use UTF-8
     as their primary character set.  Transliterating from UTF-8 to ASCII in
     this scenario is lossy and pointless.

AUTHORS
     detox was written by Doug Harple.

CAVEATS
     If, after the translation of a filename is finished, a file already
     exists with that same name, detox will not rename the file.
