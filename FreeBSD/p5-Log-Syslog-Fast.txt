NAME
       Log::Syslog::Fast - Perl extension for sending syslog messages over
       TCP, UDP, or UNIX sockets with minimal CPU overhead.

SYNOPSIS
         use Log::Syslog::Fast ':all';
         my $logger = Log::Syslog::Fast->new(LOG_UDP, "127.0.0.1", 514, LOG_LOCAL0, LOG_INFO, "mymachine", "logger");
         $logger->send("log message", time);

DESCRIPTION
       This module sends syslog messages over a network socket. It works like
       Sys::Syslog in setlogsock's 'udp', 'tcp', or 'unix' modes, but without
       the significant CPU overhead of that module when used for high-volume
       logging. Use of this specialized module is only recommended if 1) you
       must use network syslog as a messaging transport but 2) need to
       minimize the time spent in the logger.

       This module supercedes the less general Log::Syslog::UDP.

METHODS
       Log::Syslog::Fast->new($proto, $hostname, $port, $facility, $severity,
       $sender, $name);
           Create a new Log::Syslog::Fast object with the following
           parameters:

           $proto
               The transport protocol: one of LOG_TCP, LOG_UDP, or LOG_UNIX.

               If LOG_TCP or LOG_UNIX is used, calls to $logger->send() will
               block until remote receipt of the message is confirmed. If
               LOG_UDP is used, the call will never block and may fail if
               insufficient buffer space exists in the network stack (in which
               case an exception will be thrown).

               With LOG_UNIX, ->new will first attempt to connect with a
               SOCK_STREAM socket, and then try a SOCK_DGRAM if that is what
               the server expects (e.g.  rsyslog).

           $hostname
               For LOG_TCP and LOG_UDP, the destination hostname where a
               syslogd is running.  For LOG_UNIX, the path to the UNIX socket
               where syslogd is listening (typically /dev/log).

           $port
               For LOG_TCP and LOG_UDP, the destination port where a syslogd
               is listening, usually 514. Unused for LOG_UNIX, but should not
               be undefined or a warning will be emitted under strict.

           $facility
               The syslog facility constant, eg 16 for 'local0'. See RFC3164
               section 4.1.1 (or <sys/syslog.h>) for appropriate constant
               values. See EXPORTS below for making these available by name.

               The priority value is computed from the facility and severity
               per the RFC.

           $severity
               The syslog severity constant, eg 6 for 'info'. See RFC3164
               section 4.1.1 (or <sys/syslog.h>) for appropriate constant
               values. See EXPORTS below for making these available by name.

           $sender
               The originating hostname. Sys::Hostname::hostname is typically
               a reasonable source for this.

           $name
               The program name or tag to use for the message.

       $logger->send($logmsg, [$time])
       $logger->emit($logmsg, [$time])
           Send a syslog message through the configured logger. If $time is
           not provided, time(2) will be called for you. That doubles the
           syscalls per message, so try to pass it if you're already calling
           time() yourself.

           ->send may throw an exception if the system call fails (e.g. the
           transport becomes disconnected for connected protocols, or the
           kernel buffer is full for unconnected). For this reason it is
           usually wise to wrap calls with an exception handler. Likewise,
           calling ->send from a $SIG{__DIE__} handler is unwise.

           emit is an alias for send.

           NEWLINE CAVEAT

           Note that send does not add any newline character(s) to its input.
           You will certainly want to do this yourself for TCP connections, or
           the server will not treat each message as a separate line. However
           with UDP the server should accept a message without a trailing
           newline (though some implementations may have difficulty with
           that).

       $logger->set_receiver($proto, $hostname, $port)
           Change the protocol, destination host, and port. This will force a
           reconnection in LOG_TCP or LOG_UNIX mode.

       $logger->set_priority($facility, $severity)
           Change both the syslog facility and severity.

       $logger->set_facility($facility)
           Change only the syslog facility.

       $logger->set_severity($severity)
           Change only the syslog severity.

       $logger->set_sender($sender)
           Change what is sent as the hostname of the sender.

       $logger->set_name($name)
           Change what is sent as the name of the sending program.

       $logger->set_pid($name)
           Change what is sent as the process id of the sending program.

       $logger->set_format($format)
           Change the message format. This should be either the constant
           LOG_RFC3164 (the default) or LOG_RFC5424 or LOG_RFC3164_LOCAL
           (without HOSTNAME).

       $logger->get_priority()
           Returns the current priority value.

       $logger->get_facility()
           Returns the current facility value.

       $logger->get_severity()
           Returns the current severity value.

       $logger->get_format($format)
           Returns the current message format.

UNREACHABLE SERVERS
       If the remote syslogd is unreachable, certain methods may throw an
       exception or raise a signal:

       •   LOG_TCP

           If the server is unreachable at connect time, ->new will fail with
           an exception. If an established connection is closed remotely,
           ->send will fail with an exception.

       •   LOG_UDP

           As UDP is connectionless, ->new will not throw an error as no
           attempt to connect is made then. However, if the remote server
           starts or becomes unreachable and 1) the host is alive but 2) not
           listening on the specified port, and 3) ICMP packets are routable
           to the client, an exception may be thrown by ->send; note that this
           may happen only on the second call, and subsequently every other
           one. This behavior also depends on specific kernel interactions.

       •   LOG_UNIX

           With both SOCK_STREAM- and SOCK_DGRAM-based servers, ->new will
           throw an exception if the socket is missing or not connectable.

           With SOCK_DGRAM, ->send to a peer that went away will throw. With
           SOCK_STREAM, ->send to a peer that went away will raise SIGPIPE.

EXPORTS
       Use Log::Syslog::Constants to export priority constants, e.g. LOG_INFO.

BUGS
       LOG_UNIX with SOCK_DGRAM has not been well tested.
