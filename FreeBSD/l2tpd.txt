l2tp-secrets(5)                                                l2tp-secrets(5)

NAME
       l2tp-secrets - L2TPD secrets file

DESCRIPTION
       The l2tp-secrets file contains challenge-response authentication
       information for l2tpd, the implementation of l2tp protocol.  The format
       of the file is derived from the pap and chap secrets file format used
       in pppd.

       The secrets file is composed of zero or more lines with 3 fields each.
       Each line represents an authentication secret.  The 3 fields represent
       our hostname, the remote hostname and the secret used in the
       authentication process.

       The first field is for our hostname, a "*" may be used as a wildcard.
       At present, we always use the hostname "eriwan".  This needs to be
       fixed.

       The second field is for the remote system's hostname.  Again, a "*" may
       be used as a wildcard.

       The third field is the secret used if the previous two fields match the
       hostnames of the systems involved.  The secret should, ideally, be at
       16 characters long (the length of an MD5 digest output), and should
       probably be longer to ensure sufficient security.  There is no minimum
       length requirement, however.
