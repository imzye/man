SLAPO-ALLOP(5)            FreeBSD File Formats Manual           SLAPO-ALLOP(5)

NAME
       slapo-allop - All Operational Attributes overlay

SYNOPSIS
       ETCDIR/slapd.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The All Operational Attributes overlay is designed to allow slapd to
       interoperate with dumb clients that expect all attributes, including
       operational ones, to be returned when "*" or an empty attribute list is
       requested, as opposed to RFC2251 and RFC3673.

CONFIGURATION
       These slapd.conf options apply to the All Operational overlay.  They
       should appear after the overlay directive and before any subsequent
       database directive.

       allop-URI <ldapURI>
              Specify the base and the scope of search operations that trigger
              the overlay.  By default, it is "ldap:///??base", i.e. it only
              applies to the rootDSE.  This requires the overlay to be
              instantiated as global.


EXAMPLES
       default behavior: only affects requests to the rootDSE
               # global
               overlay         allop

       affects all requests
               # global
               overlay         allop
               allop-URI       "ldap:///??sub"

       affects only requests directed to the suffix of a database
               # per database
               database        mdb
               suffix          "dc=example,dc=com"
               # database specific directives ...
               overlay         allop
               allop-URI       "ldap:///dc=example,dc=com??base"
