RELAYD.CONF(5)            FreeBSD File Formats Manual           RELAYD.CONF(5)

NAME
     relayd.conf – relay daemon configuration file

DESCRIPTION
     relayd.conf is the configuration file for the relay daemon, relayd(8).

     relayd.conf is divided into the following main sections:

     Macros
           User-defined variables may be defined and used later, simplifying
           the configuration file.

     Global Configuration
           Global settings for relayd(8).  Do note that the config file allows
           global settings to be added after defining tables in the config
           file, but those tables will use the built-in defaults instead of
           the global settings below them.

     Tables
           Table definitions describe a list of hosts, in a similar fashion to
           pf(4) tables.  They are used for relay and redirection target
           selection with the described options and health checking on the
           host they contain.

     Redirections
           Redirections are translated to pf(4) rdr-to rules for stateful
           forwarding to a target host from a health-checked table on layer 3.

     Relays
           Relays allow application layer load balancing, TLS acceleration,
           and general purpose TCP proxying on layer 7.

     Protocols
           Protocols are predefined settings and filter rules for relays.

     Within the sections, a host address can be specified by IPv4 address,
     IPv6 address, interface name, interface group, or DNS hostname.  If the
     address is an interface name, relayd(8) will look up the first IPv4
     address and any other IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of the specified network
     interface.  A port can be specified by number or name.  The port name to
     number mappings are found in the file /etc/services; see services(5) for
     details.

     The current line can be extended over multiple lines using a backslash
     (‘\’).  Comments can be put anywhere in the file using a hash mark (‘#’),
     and extend to the end of the current line.  Care should be taken when
     commenting out multi-line text: the comment is effective until the end of
     the entire block.

     Argument names not beginning with a letter, digit, or underscore must be
     quoted.

     Additional configuration files can be included with the include keyword,
     for example:

           include "/usr/local/etc/relayd.conf.local"

MACROS
     Macros can be defined that will later be expanded in context.  Macro
     names must start with a letter, digit, or underscore, and may contain any
     of those characters.  Macro names may not be reserved words (for example,
     table, relay, or timeout).  Macros are not expanded inside quotes.

     For example:

           www1="10.0.0.1"
           www2="10.0.0.2"
           table <webhosts> {
                   $www1
                   $www2
           }

GLOBAL CONFIGURATION
     Here are the settings that can be set globally:

     agentx [context context] [path path]
             Export relayd(8) metrics via an agentx compatible (snmp) daemon
             by connecting to path.  Metrics can be found under the
             relaydMIBObjects subtree (enterprises.30155.3).  If path is
             omitted, it will default to /var/agentx/master.  Context is the
             SNMPv3 context and can usually be omitted.

     interval number
             Set the interval in seconds at which the hosts will be checked.
             The default interval is 10 seconds.

     log (state changes|host checks)
             Log host checks: Either log only the state changes of hosts or
             log all host checks that were run, even if the state didn't
             change.  The host state can be “up” (the health check completed
             successfully), “down” (the host is down or didn't match the check
             criteria), or “unknown” (the host is disabled or has not been
             checked yet).

     log connection [errors]
             When using relays, log all TCP connections.  Optionally log only
             connection errors.

     prefork number
             When using relays, run the specified number of processes to
             handle relayed connections.  This increases the performance and
             prevents delays when connecting to a relay.  relayd(8) runs 3
             relay processes by default and every process will handle all
             configured relays.

     socket "path"
             Create a control socket at path.  By default /var/run/relayd.sock
             is used.

     timeout number
             Set the global timeout in milliseconds for checks.  This can be
             overridden by the timeout value in the table definitions.  The
             default timeout is 200 milliseconds and it must not exceed the
             global interval.  The default value is optimized for checks
             within the same collision domain – use a higher timeout, such as
             1000 milliseconds, for checks of hosts in other subnets.  If this
             option is to be set, it should be placed before overrides in
             tables.

TABLES
     Tables are used to group a set of hosts as the target for redirections or
     relays; they will be mapped to a pf(4) table for redirections.  Tables
     may be defined with the following attribute:

     disable  Start the table disabled – no hosts will be checked in this
              table.  The table can be later enabled through relayctl(8).

     Each table must contain at least one host address; multiple hosts are
     separated by newline, comma, or whitespace.  Host entries may be defined
     with the following attributes:

     ip ttl number
            Change the default time-to-live value in the IP headers for host
            checks.

     parent number
            The optional parent option inherits the state from a parent host
            with the specified identifier.  The check will be skipped for this
            host and copied from the parent host.  This can be used to prevent
            multiple checks on hosts with multiple IP addresses for the same
            service.  The host identifiers are sequentially assigned to the
            configured hosts starting with 1; it can be shown with the
            relayctl(8) show summary commands.

     priority number
            Change the route priority used when adding a route.  If not
            specified, the kernel will set a priority of 8 (RTP_STATIC).  In
            ordinary use, a fallback route should be added statically with a
            very high (e.g. 52) priority.  Unused in all other modes.

     retry number
            The optional retry option adds a tolerance for failed host checks;
            the check will be retried for number more times before setting the
            host state to down.  If this table is used by a relay, it will
            also specify the number of retries for outgoing connection
            attempts.

     For example:

           table <service> { 192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2, 192.168.2.3 }
           table <fallback> disable { 10.1.5.1 retry 2 }

           redirect "www" {
                   listen on www.example.com port 80
                   forward to <service> check http "/" code 200
                   forward to <fallback> check http "/" code 200
           }

     Tables are used by forward to directives in redirections or relays with a
     set of general options, health-checking rules, and timings; see the
     REDIRECTIONS and RELAYS sections for more information about the forward
     context.  Table specific configuration directives are described below.
     Multiple options can be appended to forward to directives, separated by
     whitespaces.

     The following options will configure the health-checking method for the
     table, and is mandatory for redirections:

     check http path [host hostname] code number
             For each host in the table, verify that retrieving the URL path
             gives the HTTP return code number.  If hostname is specified, it
             is used as the “Host:” header to query a specific hostname at the
             target host.  To validate the HTTP return code, use this shell
             command:

                   $ echo -n "HEAD <path> HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n" | \
                           nc <host> <port> | head -n1

             This prints the status header including the actual return code:

                   HTTP/1.1 200 OK

     check https path [host hostname] code number
             This has the same effect as above but wraps the HTTP request in
             TLS.

     check http path [host hostname] digest string
             For each host in the table, verify that retrieving the URL path
             produces non-binary content whose message digest matches the
             defined string.  The algorithm used is determined by the string
             length of the digest argument, either SHA1 (40 characters) or MD5
             (32 characters).  If hostname is specified, it is used as the
             “Host:” header to query a specific hostname at the target host.
             The digest does not take the HTTP headers into account.  Do not
             specify a binary object (such as a graphic) as the target of the
             request, as relayd.conf expects the data returned to be a string.
             To compute the digest, use this simple command:

                   $ ftp -o - http://host[:port]/path | sha1

             This gives a digest that can be used as-is in a digest statement:

                   a9993e36476816aba3e25717850c26c9cd0d89d

     check https path [host hostname] digest string
             This has the same effect as above but wraps the HTTP request in
             TLS.

     check icmp
             Ping hosts in this table to determine whether they are up or not.
             This method will automatically use ICMP or ICMPV6 depending on
             the address family of each host.

     check script path
             Execute an external program to check the host state.  The program
             will be executed for each host by specifying the hostname on the
             command line:

                   /usr/local/bin/checkload.pl front-www1.private.example.com

             relayd(8) expects a positive return value on success and zero on
             failure.  Note that the script will be executed with the
             privileges of the "_relayd" user and terminated after timeout
             milliseconds.

     check send data expect pattern [tls]
             For each host in the table, a TCP connection is established on
             the port specified, then data is sent.  Incoming data is then
             read and is expected to match against pattern using shell
             globbing rules.  If data is an empty string or nothing then
             nothing is sent on the connection and data is immediately read.
             This can be useful with protocols that output a banner like SMTP,
             NNTP, and FTP.  If the tls keyword is present, the transaction
             will occur in a TLS tunnel.

     check binary send data expect data [tls]
             For each host in the table, a TCP connection is established on
             the port specified, then the send data is converted into binary
             and sent.  Incoming (binary) data is then read and is expected to
             match against a binary conversion of the expect data using
             memcmp(3).  data must be populated with a string containing an
             even number of hexadecimal single-byte characters and must not be
             empty.  This can be useful with binary protocols such as LDAP and
             SNMP.  If the tls keyword is present, the transaction will occur
             in a TLS tunnel.

     check tcp
             Use a simple TCP connect to check that hosts are up.

     check tls
             Perform a complete TLS handshake with each host to check their
             availability.

     The following general table options are available:

     interval number
             Override the global interval and specify one for this table.  It
             must be a multiple of the global interval.

     timeout number
             Set the timeout in milliseconds for each host that is checked
             using TCP as the transport.  This will override the global
             timeout, which is 200 milliseconds by default.

     The following options will set the scheduling algorithm to select a host
     from the specified table:

     mode hash [key]
             Balances the outgoing connections across the active hosts based
             on the key, IP address and port of the relay.  Additional input
             can be fed into the hash by looking at HTTP headers and GET
             variables; see the PROTOCOLS section below.  This mode is only
             supported by relays.

     mode least-states
             Forward each outgoing connection to the active host with the
             least active pf(4) states.  This mode is only supported by
             redirections.

     mode loadbalance [key]
             Balances the outgoing connections across the active hosts based
             on the key, the source IP address of the client, and the IP
             address and port of the relay.  This mode is only supported by
             relays.

     mode random
             Distributes the outgoing connections randomly through all active
             hosts.  This mode is supported by redirections and relays.

     mode roundrobin
             Distributes the outgoing connections using a round-robin
             scheduler through all active hosts.  This is the default mode and
             will be used if no option has been specified.  This mode is
             supported by redirections and relays.

     mode source-hash [key]
             Balances the outgoing connections across the active hosts based
             on the key and the source IP address of the client.  This mode is
             supported by redirections and relays.

     The optional key argument can be specified for the hash, loadbalance, and
     source-hash modes as either a hex value with a leading ‘0x’ or as a
     string.  If omitted, relayd(8) generates a random key when the
     configuration is loaded.

REDIRECTIONS
     Redirections represent a pf(4) rdr-to rule.  They are used for stateful
     redirections to the hosts in the specified tables.  pf(4) rewrites the
     target IP addresses and ports of the incoming connections, operating on
     layer 3.  The configuration directives that are valid in the redirect
     context are described below:

     disable
             The redirection is initially disabled.  It can be later enabled
             through relayctl(8).

     forward to <table> [port number] options ...
             Specify the tables of target hosts to be used; see the TABLES
             section above for information about table options.  If the port
             option is not specified, the first port from the listen on
             directive will be used.  This directive can be specified twice –
             the second entry will be used as the backup table if all hosts in
             the main table are down.  At least one entry for the main table
             is mandatory.

     listen on address [ip-proto] port port [interface name]
             Specify an address and a port to listen on.  pf(4) will redirect
             incoming connections for the specified target to the hosts in the
             main or backup table.  The port argument can optionally specify a
             port range instead of a single port; the format is
             min-port:max-port.  The optional argument ip-proto can be used to
             specify an IP protocol like tcp or udp; it defaults to tcp.  The
             rule can be optionally restricted to a given interface name.

     [match] pftag name
             Automatically tag packets passing through the pf(4) rdr-to rule
             with the name supplied.  This allows simpler filter rules.  The
             optional match keyword will change the default rule action from
             ‘pass in quick’ to ‘match in’ to allow further evaluation in the
             pf ruleset using the tagged name rule option.

     route to <table> [port number] options ...
             Like the forward to directive, but directly routes the packets to
             the target host without modifying the target address using a
             pf(4) route-to rule.  This can be used for “direct server return”
             to force the target host to respond via a different gateway.
             Note that hosts have to accept sessions for the same address as
             the gateway, which is typically done by configuring a loopback
             interface on the host with this address.

     session timeout seconds
             Specify the inactivity timeout in seconds for established
             redirections.  The default timeout is 600 seconds (10 minutes).
             The maximum is 2147483647 seconds (68 years).

     sticky-address
             This has the same effect as specifying sticky-address for an rdr-
             to rule in pf.conf(5).  It will ensure that multiple connections
             from the same source are mapped to the same redirection address.

RELAYS
     Relays will forward traffic between a client and a target server.  In
     contrast to redirections and IP forwarding in the network stack, a relay
     will accept incoming connections from remote clients as a server, open an
     outgoing connection to a target host, and forward any traffic between the
     target host and the remote client, operating on layer 7.  A relay is also
     called an application layer gateway or layer 7 proxy.

     The main purpose of a relay is to provide advanced load balancing
     functionality based on specified protocol characteristics, such as HTTP
     headers, to provide TLS acceleration and to allow basic handling of the
     underlying application protocol.

     The relay configuration directives are described below:

     disable
             Start the relay but immediately close any accepted connections.

     [transparent] forward [with tls] to address [port port] options ...
             Specify the address and port of the target host to connect to.
             If the port option is not specified, the port from the listen on
             directive will be used.  Use the transparent keyword to enable
             fully-transparent mode; the source address of the client will be
             retained in this case.

             The with tls directive enables client-side TLS mode to connect to
             the remote host.  Verification of server certificates can be
             enabled by setting the ca file option in the protocol section.

             The following options may be specified for forward directives:

             inet    If the requested destination is an IPv6 address,
                     relayd(8) will forward the connection to an IPv4 address
                     which is determined by the last 4 octets of the original
                     IPv6 destination.  For example, if the original IPv6
                     destination address is 2001:db8:7395:ffff::a01:101, the
                     session is relayed to the IPv4 address 10.1.1.1
                     (a01:101).

             inet6 address-prefix
                     If the requested destination is an IPv4 address,
                     relayd(8) will forward the connection to an IPv6 address
                     which is determined by setting the last 4 octets of the
                     specified IPv6 address-prefix to the 4 octets of the
                     original IPv4 destination.  For example, if the original
                     IPv4 destination address is 10.1.1.1 and the specified
                     address prefix is 2001:db8:7395:ffff::, the session is
                     relayed to the IPv6 address 2001:db8:7395:ffff::a01:101.

             retry number
                     The optional host retry option will be used as a
                     tolerance for failed host connections; the connection
                     will be retried for number more times.

     forward to <table> [port port] options ...
             Like the previous directive, but connect to a host from the
             specified table; see the TABLES section above for information
             about table options.  This directive can be specified multiple
             times – subsequent entries will be used as the backup table if
             all hosts in the previous table are down.  At least one entry for
             the main table is mandatory.  As above, use the with tls
             directive to enable client-side TLS mode when connecting to the
             remote host.

     forward to destination options ...
             When redirecting connections with a rdr-to rule in pf.conf(5) to
             a relay listening on localhost, this directive will look up the
             real destination address of the intended target host, allowing
             the relay to be run as a transparent proxy.  If an additional
             forward to directive to a specified address or table is present,
             it will be used as a backup if the NAT lookup failed.  As above,
             use the with tls directive to enable client-side TLS mode when
             connecting to the remote host.

     listen on address port port [tls]
             Specify the address and port for the relay to listen on.  The
             relay will accept incoming connections to the specified address.
             If the tls keyword is present, the relay will accept connections
             using the encrypted TLS protocol.

     protocol name
             Use the specified protocol definition for the relay.  The generic
             TCP protocol options will be used by default; see the PROTOCOLS
             section below.

     session timeout seconds
             Specify the inactivity timeout in seconds for accepted sessions.
             The default timeout is 600 seconds (10 minutes).  The maximum is
             2147483647 seconds (68 years).

TLS RELAYS
     In addition to plain TCP, relayd(8) supports the Transport Layer Security
     (TLS) cryptographic protocol for authenticated and encrypted relays.
     relayd(8) can operate as a TLS client or server to offer a variety of
     options for different use cases related to TLS.

     TLS client
             When configuring the relay forward statements with the with tls
             directive, relayd(8) will enable client-side TLS to connect to
             the remote host.  This is commonly used for TLS tunneling and
             transparent encapsulation of plain TCP connections.  See the
             forward to description in the RELAYS section for more details.

     TLS server
             When specifying the tls keyword in the relay listen statements,
             relayd(8) will accept connections from clients as a TLS server.
             This mode is also known as “TLS acceleration”.  See the listen on
             description in the RELAYS section for more details.

     TLS client and server
             When combining both modes, TLS server and client, relayd(8) can
             filter TLS connections as a man-in-the-middle.  This combined
             mode is also called “TLS inspection”.  The configuration requires
             additional X.509 certificate settings; see the ca key description
             in the PROTOCOLS section for more details.

     When configured for “TLS inspection” mode, relayd(8) will listen for
     incoming connections which have been diverted to the local socket by PF.
     Before accepting and negotiating the incoming TLS connection as a server,
     it will look up the original destination address on the diverted socket,
     and pre-connect to the target server as a TLS client to obtain the remote
     TLS certificate.  It will update or patch the obtained TLS certificate by
     replacing the included public key with its local server key because it
     doesn't have the private key of the remote server certificate.  It also
     updates the X.509 issuer name to the local CA subject name and signs the
     certificate with its local CA key.  This way it keeps all the other X.509
     attributes that are already present in the server certificate, including
     the "green bar" extended validation attributes.  Now it finally accepts
     the TLS connection from the diverted client using the updated certificate
     and continues to handle the connection and to connect to the remote
     server.

PROTOCOLS
     Protocols are templates defining settings and rules for relays.  They
     allow setting generic TCP options, TLS settings, and rules for the
     selected application layer protocol.

     The protocol directive is available for a number of different application
     layer protocols.  There is no generic handler for UDP-based protocols
     because it is a stateless datagram-based protocol which has to look into
     the application layer protocol to find any possible state information.

     dns protocol
             (UDP) Domain Name System (DNS) protocol.  The requested IDs in
             the DNS header will be used to match the state.  relayd(8)
             replaces these IDs with random values to compensate for
             predictable values generated by some hosts.

     http protocol
             Handle the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP, or "HTTPS" if
             encapsulated in a TLS tunnel).

     [tcp] protocol
             Generic handler for TCP-based protocols.  This is the default.

     The available configuration directives are described below:

     (block|pass|match) [rule]
             Specify one or more rules to filter connections based on their
             network or application layer headers; see the FILTER RULES
             section for more details.

     return error [option]
             Return an error response to the client if an internal operation
             or the forward connection to the client failed.  By default, the
             connection will be silently dropped.  The effect of this option
             depends on the protocol: HTTP will send an error header and page
             to the client before closing the connection.  Additional valid
             options are:

             style string
                     Specify a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) to be used for the
                     returned HTTP error pages, for example:

                           body { background: #a00000; color: white; }

     tcp option
             Enable or disable the specified TCP/IP options; see tcp(4) and
             ip(4) for more information about the options.  Valid options are:

             backlog number
                     Set the maximum length the queue of pending connections
                     may grow to.  The backlog option is 10 by default, is
                     limited to 512 and capped by the kern.somaxconn sysctl(8)
                     variable.

             ip minttl number
                     This option for the underlying IP connection may be used
                     to discard packets with a TTL lower than the specified
                     value.  This can be used to implement the Generalized TTL
                     Security Mechanism (GTSM) according to RFC 5082.

             ip ttl number
                     Change the default time-to-live value in the IP headers.

             nodelay
                     Enable the TCP NODELAY option for this connection.  This
                     is recommended to avoid delays in the relayed data
                     stream, e.g. for SSH connections.  The default is no
                     nodelay.

             no splice
                     Disable socket splicing for zero-copy data transfer.  The
                     default is to enable socket splicing.

             sack    Use selective acknowledgements for this connection.  The
                     default is no sack.

             socket buffer number
                     Set the socket-level buffer size for input and output for
                     this connection.  This will affect the TCP window size.

     tls option
             Set the TLS options and session settings.  This is only used if
             TLS is enabled in the relay.  Valid options are:

             ca cert path
                     Specify a CA certificate for TLS inspection.  For more
                     information, see the ca key option below.

             ca file path
                     This option enables CA verification in TLS client mode.
                     The daemon will load the CA (Certificate Authority)
                     certificates from the specified path to verify the server
                     certificates.  OpenBSD provides a default CA bundle in
                     /etc/ssl/cert.pem.

             ca key path password password
                     Specify a CA key for TLS inspection.  The password
                     argument will specify the password to decrypt the CA key
                     (typically an RSA key).  This option will enable TLS
                     inspection if the following conditions are true:

                           •   TLS server mode is enabled by the listen
                               directive: listen on ... tls.
                           •   TLS client mode and divert lookups are enabled
                               by the forward directive: forward with tls to
                               destination.
                           •   The ca cert option is specified.
                           •   The ca key option is specified.

             ciphers string
                     Set the string defining the TLS cipher suite.  If not
                     specified, the default value ‘HIGH:!aNULL’ will be used
                     (strong crypto cipher suites without anonymous DH).  See
                     the CIPHERS section of openssl(1) for information about
                     TLS cipher suites and preference lists.

             client-renegotiation
                     Allow client-initiated renegotiation.  To mitigate a
                     potential DoS risk, the default is no
                     client-renegotiation.

             ecdhe curves
                     Specify a comma separated list of elliptic curves to use
                     for ECDHE cipher suites, in order of preference.  The
                     special value of "default" will use the default curves;
                     see tls_config_set_ecdhecurves(3) for further details.

             edh [params (none|auto|legacy)]
                     Enable EDH-based cipher suites with Perfect Forward
                     Secrecy (PFS) for older clients that do not support
                     ECDHE.  In auto mode, the key size of the ephemeral key
                     is automatically selected based on the size of the
                     private key used for signing.  In legacy mode, a 1024 bit
                     ephemeral key is used.  If params is omitted, auto is
                     used.  The default is no edh.

             keypair name
                     The relay will attempt to look up a private key in
                     /etc/ssl/private/name:port.key and a public certificate
                     in /etc/ssl/name:port.crt, where port is the specified
                     port that the relay listens on.  If these files are not
                     present, the relay will continue to look in
                     /etc/ssl/private/name.key and /etc/ssl/name.crt.  This
                     option can be specified multiple times for TLS Server
                     Name Indication.  If not specified, a keypair will be
                     loaded using the specified IP address of the relay as
                     name.  See ssl(8) for details about TLS server
                     certificates.

                     An optional OCSP staple file will be used during TLS
                     handshakes with this server if it is found as a non-empty
                     file in /etc/ssl/name:port.ocsp or /etc/ssl/name.ocsp.
                     The file should contain a DER-format OCSP response
                     retrieved from an OCSP server for the certificate in use,
                     and can be created using ocspcheck(8).

             no cipher-server-preference
                     Prefer the client's cipher list over the server's
                     preferences when choosing a cipher for the connection.
                     The default is to prefer the server's cipher list.

             session tickets
                     Enable TLS session tickets.  relayd(8) supports stateless
                     TLS session tickets (RFC 5077) to implement TLS session
                     resumption for connections not using TLSv1.3.  The
                     default is to disable session tickets.

             no tlsv1.3
                     Disable the TLSv1.3 protocol.  The default is to enable
                     TLSv1.3.

             no tlsv1.2
                     Disable the TLSv1.2 protocol.  The default is to enable
                     TLSv1.2.

             sslv3   Is deprecated and does nothing.

             tlsv1   Enable all TLSv1 protocols.  This is an alias that
                     currently includes tlsv1.2, and tlsv1.3.  The default is
                     no tlsv1.

             tlsv1.0
                     Is deprecated and does nothing.

             tlsv1.1
                     Is deprecated and does nothing.

     http option
             Set the HTTP options and session settings.  This is only used if
             HTTP is enabled in the relay.  Valid options are:

             headerlen number
                     Set the maximum size of all HTTP headers in bytes.  The
                     default value is 8192 and it is limited to a maximum of
                     131072.

             websockets
                     Allow connection upgrade to websocket protocol.  The
                     default is no websockets.

FILTER RULES
     Relays have the ability to filter connections based on their network or
     application layer headers.  Filter rules apply options to connections
     based on the specified filter parameters.

     For each connection that is processed by a relay, the filter rules are
     evaluated in sequential order, from first to last.  For block and pass,
     the last matching rule decides what action is taken; if no rule matches
     the connection, the default action is to establish the connection without
     any additional action.  For match, rules are evaluated every time they
     match; the pass/block state of a connection remains unchanged.

     The filter action may be one of the following:

     block   The connection is blocked.  If a block rule matches a new
             connection attempt, it will not be established.  block rules can
             also trigger for existing connections after evaluating
             application layer parameters; any connection of the relay session
             will be instantly dropped.

     match   The connection is matched.  This action does not alter the
             connection state, but allows additional parameters to the
             connection.

     pass    The connection is passed; relayd(8) will continue to process the
             relay session normally.

     These filter parameters can be used in the rules:

     request or response
             A relay session always consists of two connections: the request,
             a client initiating a new connection to a server via the relay,
             and the response, the server accepting the connection.  Depending
             on the protocol, an established session can be purely
             request/response-based (like HTTP), exchange data in a
             bidirectional way (like arbitrary TCP sessions), or just contain
             a single datagram and an optional response (like UDP-based
             protocols).  But the client always requests to communicate with a
             remote peer; the server.

     quick   If a connection is matched by a rule with the quick option set,
             the rule is considered to be the last matching rule and any
             further evaluation is skipped.

     inet or inet6
             Only match connections with the specified address family, either
             of type IPv4 or IPv6.

     from address[/prefix]
             This rule only matches for connections from the specified source.

     to address[/prefix]
             This rule only matches for connections to the specified
             destination.  The destination is the address the client was
             connecting to, typically the relay's listen address in non-
             transparent mode, not the address of the forwarded backend
             connection.

     forward to <table>
             Forward the request to a server in the specified table.  With
             this option, requests can be passed to specific backend servers.
             A corresponding forward to declaration in the RELAYS section is
             required.

     label string
             The label will be printed as part of the error message if the
             return error option is set and may contain HTML tags, for
             example:

                   block request url digest 5c1e03f58f8ce0b457474ffb371fd1ef \
                           label "<a href='http://example.com/adv.pl?id=7359'>\
                           Advisory provided by example.com</a>"

     no parameter
             Reset a sticky parameter that was previously set by a matching
             rule.  The parameter is a keyword that can be either label or
             tag.

     tag string
             Add a "sticky" tag to connections matching this filter rule.
             Tags can be used to filter the connection by further rules using
             the tagged option.  Only one tag is assigned per connection; the
             tag will be replaced if the connection is already tagged.

     tagged string
             Match the connection if it is already tagged with a given tag by
             a previous rule.

     The following parameters are available when using the http protocol:

     method name
             Match the HTTP request method.  The method is specified by name
             and can be either ACL, BASELINE-CONTROL, CHECKIN, CHECKOUT,
             CONNECT, COPY, DELETE, GET, HEAD, LABEL, LOCK, MERGE, MKACTIVITY,
             MKCOL, MKREDIRECTREF, MKWORKSPACE, MOVE, OPTIONS, ORDERPATCH,
             PATCH, POST, PROPFIND, PROPPATCH, PUT, REPORT, SEARCH, TRACE,
             UNCHECKOUT, UNLOCK, UPDATE, UPDATEREDIRECTREF, or
             VERSION-CONTROL.

     type option [[digest] (key|file path) [value value]]
             Match a specified HTTP header entity and an optional key and
             value.  An option can be specified to modify the matched entity
             or to trigger an event.  The entity is extracted from the HTTP
             request or response header and can be either of type cookie,
             header, path, query, or url.

             Instead of a single key, multiple keys can be loaded from a file
             specified by path that contains one key per line.  Lines will be
             stripped at the first whitespace or newline character and any
             empty lines or lines beginning with a hash mark (‘#’) will be
             ignored.

             If the digest keyword is specified, compare the message digest of
             the key against the defined string.  The algorithm used is
             determined by the string length of the key argument, either SHA1
             (40 characters) or MD5 (32 characters).  To compute the digest,
             for example for a url, use this simple command:

                   $ echo -n "example.com/path/?args" | sha1

     [type] may be one of:

     cookie option [key [value value]]
             Look up the entity as a value in the Cookie header.  This type is
             only available with the direction request.

     header option [key [value value]]
             Look up the entity in the application protocol headers, like HTTP
             headers in http mode.

     path option [key [value value]]
             Look up the entity as a value in the URL path when using the http
             protocol.  This type is only available with the direction
             request.  The key will match the path of the requested URL
             without the hostname and query and the value will match the
             complete query, for example:

                   block path "/index.html"
                   block path "/cgi-bin/t.cgi" value "foo=bar*"

     path strip number
             Strip number path components from the beginning of the path of
             the requested URL when using the http protocol.  This type is
             only available with the direction request.

     query option [key [value value]]
             Look up the entity as a query variable in the URL when using the
             http protocol.  This type is only available with the direction
             request, for example:

                   # Will match /cgi-bin/example.pl?foo=bar&ok=yes
                   pass request query "foo" value "bar"

     url option [[digest] key [value value]]
             Look up the entity as a URL suffix/prefix expression consisting
             of a canonicalized hostname without port or suffix and a path
             name or prefix when using the http protocol.  This type is only
             available with the direction request, for example:

                   block url "example.com/index.html"
                   block url "example.com/test.cgi?val=1"

             relayd(8) will match the full URL and different possible
             suffix/prefix combinations by stripping subdomains and path
             components (up to 5 levels), and the query string.  For example,
             the following lookups will be done for
             http://www.example.com:81/1/2/3/4/5.html?query=yes:

                   www.example.com/1/2/3/4/5.html?query=yes
                   www.example.com/1/2/3/4/5.html
                   www.example.com/
                   www.example.com/1/
                   www.example.com/1/2/
                   www.example.com/1/2/3/
                   example.com/1/2/3/4/5.html?query=yes
                   example.com/1/2/3/4/5.html
                   example.com/
                   example.com/1/
                   example.com/1/2/
                   example.com/1/2/3/

     [option] may be one of:

     append  Append the specified value to a protocol entity with the selected
             key name.  If it does not exist, it will be created with the new
             value.

             The value string may contain predefined macros that will be
             expanded at runtime:

                   $HOST         The Host header's value of the relay.
                   $REMOTE_ADDR  The IP address of the connected client.
                   $REMOTE_PORT  The TCP source port of the connected client.
                   $SERVER_ADDR  The configured IP address of the relay.
                   $SERVER_PORT  The configured TCP server port of the relay.
                   $SERVER_NAME  The server software name of relayd(8).
                   $TIMEOUT      The configured session timeout of the relay.

     hash    Feed the value of the selected entity into the load balancing
             hash to select the target host.  See the table keyword in the
             RELAYS section above.

     log     Log the key name and the value of the entity.

     remove  Remove the entity with the selected key name.

     set     Like the append directive above, but change the contents of the
             specified entity.  If key does not exist in the request, it will
             be created with the new value.

             The value string may contain predefined macros that will be
             expanded at runtime, as detailed for the append directive above.

                                               relayd(8).

EXAMPLES
     This configuration file would create a redirection service “www” which
     load balances four hosts and falls back to one host containing a “sorry
     page”:

           www1=front-www1.private.example.com
           www2=front-www2.private.example.com
           www3=front-www3.private.example.com
           www4=front-www4.private.example.com

           interval 5

           table <phphosts> { $www1, $www2, $www3, $www4 }
           table <sorryhost> disable { sorryhost.private.example.com }

           redirect "www" {
                   listen on www.example.com port 8080 interface trunk0
                   listen on www6.example.com port 80 interface trunk0

                   pftag REDIRECTED

                   forward to <phphosts> port 8080 timeout 300 \
                           check http "/" digest "630aa3c2f..."
                   forward to <sorryhost> port 8080 timeout 300 check icmp
           }

     It is possible to specify multiple listen directives with different IP
     protocols in a single redirection configuration:

           redirect "dns" {
                   listen on dns.example.com tcp port 53
                   listen on dns.example.com udp port 53

                   forward to <dnshosts> port 53 check tcp
           }

     The following configuration would add a relay to forward secure HTTPS
     connections to a pool of HTTP webservers using the loadbalance mode (TLS
     acceleration and layer 7 load balancing).  The HTTP protocol definition
     will add two HTTP headers containing address information of the client
     and the server, set the “Keep-Alive” header value to the configured
     session timeout, and include the “sessid” variable in the hash to
     calculate the target host:

           http protocol "https" {
                   match header set "X-Forwarded-For" \
                           value "$REMOTE_ADDR"
                   match header set "X-Forwarded-By" \
                           value "$SERVER_ADDR:$SERVER_PORT"
                   match header set "Keep-Alive" value "$TIMEOUT"

                   match query hash "sessid"

                   pass
                   block path "/cgi-bin/index.cgi" value "*command=*"

                   tls { no tlsv1.0, ciphers "HIGH" }
           }

           relay "tlsaccel" {
                   listen on www.example.com port 443 tls
                   protocol "https"
                   forward to <phphosts> port 8080 mode loadbalance check tcp
           }

     The second relay example will accept incoming connections to port 2222
     and forward them to a remote SSH server.  The TCP nodelay option will
     allow a “smooth” SSH session without delays between keystrokes or
     displayed output on the terminal:

           protocol "myssh" {
                   tcp { nodelay, socket buffer 65536 }
           }

           relay "sshforward" {
                   listen on www.example.com port 2222
                   protocol "myssh"
                   forward to shell.example.com port 22
           }

     The following relay example will configure “TLS inspection” as described
     in the TLS RELAYS section.  To start, first generate a new local CA key
     and certificate:

           # openssl req -x509 -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
                   -keyout /usr/local/etc/ssl/private/ca.key \
                   -out /usr/local/etc/etc/ssl/ca.crt

     A TLS server key and self-signed cert for 127.0.0.1 are also required;
     see listen on in the RELAYS section for more details about certificate
     locations.  Configure the packet filter with a matching divert rule in
     pf.conf(5):

           # Divert incoming HTTPS traffic to relayd
           pass in on vlan1 inet proto tcp to port 443 \
                   divert-to localhost port 8443

     And finally configure the TLS inspection in relayd.conf:

           http protocol httpfilter {
                   return error

                   pass
                   match label "Prohibited!"
                   block url "social.network.example.com/"

                   # New configuration directives for TLS Interception
                   tls ca key "/etc/ssl/private/ca.key" password "password123"
                   tls ca cert "/etc/ssl/ca.crt"
           }

           relay tlsinspect {
                   listen on 127.0.0.1 port 8443 tls
                   protocol httpfilter
                   forward with tls to destination
           }

     The next simple router configuration example can be used to run
     redundant, health-checked WAN links:

           table <gateways> { $gw1 ip ttl 1, $gw2 ip ttl 1 }
           router "uplinks" {
                   route 0.0.0.0/0
                   forward to <gateways> check icmp
           }
