micro_inetd(1)          FreeBSD General Commands Manual         micro_inetd(1)

NAME
       micro_inetd - simple network service spawner

SYNOPSIS
       micro_inetd port program [args ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Like inetd, this program listens on the net for requests and spawns a
       server to handle them.  However, it only handles one port and one
       program.  The intended use is when you have a server that expects to be
       run by inetd, but you only want to run it temporarily and don't want to
       bother with putting it into /etc/services and /etc/inetd.conf and
       restarting inetd.  Instead, just start up micro_inetd, and when you're
       done just ^C it.

       Other limitations:

       *    Full inetd lets you specify the socket type as one of stream,
            dgram, raw, rdm, or seqpacket;  micro_inetd only implements
            stream.

       *    Full inetd lets you specify wait or nowait; micro_inetd only
            implements nowait.

       *    Full inetd lets you specify a user-id to run the server as;
            micro_inetd doesn't try to switch user-ids.
