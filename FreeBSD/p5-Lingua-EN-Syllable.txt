NAME
       Lingua::EN::Syllable - Routine for estimating syllable count in words.

SYNOPSIS
         use Lingua::EN::Syllable;

         $count = syllable('supercalifragilisticexpialidocious'); # 14

DESCRIPTION
       Lingua::EN::Syllable::syllable() estimates the number of syllables in
       the word passed to it.

       Note that it isn't entirely accurate...  it fails (by one syllable) for
       about 10-15% of my /usr/dict/words.  The only way to get a 100%
       accurate count is to do a dictionary lookup, so this is a small and
       fast alternative where more-or-less accurate results will suffice, such
       as estimating the reading level of a document.

       I welcome pointers to more accurate algorithms, since this one is
       pretty quick-and-dirty.  This was designed for English (well, American
       at least) words, but sometimes guesses well for other languages.

KNOWN LIMITATIONS
       Accuracy for words with non-alpha characters is somewhat undefined.  In
       general, punctuation characters, et al, should be trimmed off before
       handing the word to syllable(), and hyphenated compounds should be
       broken into their separate parts.

       Syllables for all-digit words (eg, "1998";  some call them "numbers")
       are often counted as the number of digits.  A cooler solution would be
       converting "1998" to "nineteen eighty eight" (or "one thousand nine
       hundred eighty eight", or...), but that is left as an exercise for the
       reader.

       Contractions are not well supported.

       Compound words (like "lifeboat"), where the first word ends in a silent
       'e' are counted with an extra syllable.
