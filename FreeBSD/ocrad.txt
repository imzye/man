OCRAD(1)                         User Commands                        OCRAD(1)

NAME
       ocrad - optical text recognition tool

SYNOPSIS
       ocrad [options] [files]

DESCRIPTION
       GNU Ocrad is an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) program based on a
       feature extraction method. It reads images in png or pnm formats and
       produces text in byte (8-bit) or UTF-8 formats. The formats pbm
       (bitmap), pgm (greyscale), and ppm (color) are collectively known as
       pnm.

       Ocrad includes a layout analyser able to separate the columns or blocks
       of text normally found on printed pages.

       For best results the characters should be at least 20 pixels high. If
       they are smaller, try the option --scale. Scanning the image at 300 dpi
       usually produces a character size good enough for ocrad.  Merged, very
       bold, or very light (broken) characters are normally not recognized
       correctly. Try to avoid them.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              display this help and exit

       -V, --version
              output version information and exit

       -a, --append
              append text to output file

       -c, --charset=<name>
              try '--charset=help' for a list of names

       -e, --filter=<name>
              try '--filter=help' for a list of names

       -E, --user-filter=<file>
              user-defined filter, see manual for format

       -f, --force
              force overwrite of output file

       -F, --format=<fmt>
              output format (byte, utf8)

       -i, --invert
              invert image levels (white on black)

       -l, --layout
              perform layout analysis

       -o, --output=<file>
              place the output into <file>

       -q, --quiet
              suppress all messages

       -s, --scale=[-]<n>
              scale input image by [1/]<n>

       -t, --transform=<name>
              try '--transform=help' for a list of names

       -T, --threshold=<n>
              threshold for binarization (0.0-1.0)

       -u, --cut=<l,t,w,h>
              cut the input image by the rectangle given

       -v, --verbose
              be verbose

       -x, --export=<file>
              export results in ORF format to <file>

       If no files are specified, or if a file is '-', ocrad reads the image
       from standard input.  If the option -o is not specified, ocrad sends
       text to standard output.

       Exit status: 0 for a normal exit, 1 for environmental problems (file
       not found, invalid command-line options, I/O errors, etc), 2 to
       indicate a corrupt or invalid input file, 3 for an internal consistency
       error (e.g., bug) which caused ocrad to panic.
