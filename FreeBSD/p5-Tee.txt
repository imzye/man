NAME
       ptee - emulate the GNU tee program with Perl

VERSION
       version 0.14

SYNOPSIS
        ptee [OPTIONS]... [FILENAMES]...

        OPTIONS:

           --append or -a
               append to file(s) rather than overwrite

           --help or -h
               give usage information

           --version or -V
               print the version number of this program

DESCRIPTION
       "ptee" is a pure Perl emulation of the standard GNU tool "tee" and is
       designed to be a platform independent replacement for operating systems
       without a native "tee" program.

       It passes input received on STDIN through to STDOUT while also writing
       a copy of the input to any files provided as arguments.  By default,
       files will be overwritten, but this behavior may be altered with the
       "--append" option.

       Unlike "tee", "ptee" does not support ignoring interrupts, as signal
       handling is not sufficiently portable.
