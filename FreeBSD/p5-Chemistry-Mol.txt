NAME
       Chemistry::Atom - Chemical atoms as objects in molecules

SYNOPSIS
           use Chemistry::Atom;

           my $atom = new Chemistry::Atom(
               id => 'a1',
               coords => [$x, $y, $z],
               symbol => 'Br'
           );

           print $atom->print;

DESCRIPTION
       This module includes objects to describe chemical atoms.  An atom is
       defined by its symbol and its coordinates, among other attributes.
       Atomic coordinates are described by a Math::VectorReal object, so that
       they can be easily used in vector operations.

   Atom Attributes
       In addition to common attributes such as id, name, and type, atoms have
       the following attributes, which are accessed or modified through
       methods defined below: bonds, coords, internal_coords, Z, symbol, etc.

       In general, to get the value of a property, use $atom->method without
       any parameters. To set the value, use $atom->method($new_value). When
       setting an attribute, the accessor returns the atom object, so that
       accessors can be chained:

           $atom->symbol("C")->name("CA")->coords(1,2,3);

METHODS
       Chemistry::Atom->new(name => value, ...)
           Create a new Atom object with the specified attributes.

       $atom->Z($new_Z)
           Sets and returns the atomic number (Z). If the symbol of the atom
           doesn't correspond to a known element, Z = undef.

       $atom->symbol($new_symbol)
           Sets and returns the atomic symbol.

       $atom->mass($new_mass)
           Sets and returns the atomic mass in atomic mass units. Any
           arbitrary mass may be set explicitly by using this method. However,
           if no mass is set explicitly and this method is called as an
           accessor, the return value is the following:

           1) If the mass number is undefined (see the mass_number method
           below), the relative atomic mass from the 1995 IUPAC recommendation
           is used. (Table stolen from the Chemistry::MolecularMass module by
           Maksim A.  Khrapov).

           2) If the mass number is defined and the Chemistry::Isotope module
           is available and it knows the mass for the isotope, the exact mass
           of the isotope is used; otherwise, the mass number is returned.

       $atom->mass_number($new_mass_number)
           Sets or gets the mass number. The mass number is undefined unless
           is set explicitly (this module does not try to guess a default mass
           number based on the natural occurring isotope distribution).

       $atom->coords
               my $vector = $atom->coords;  # get a Math::VectorReal object
               $atom->coords($vector);      # set a Math::VectorReal object
               $atom->coords([$x, $y, $z]); # also accepts array refs
               $atom->coords($x, $y, $z);   # also accepts lists

           Sets or gets the atom's coordinates. It can take as a parameter a
           Math::VectorReal object, a reference to an array, or the list of
           coordinates.

       $atom->internal_coords
               # get a Chemistry::InternalCoords object
               my $ic = $atom->internal_coords;

               # set a Chemistry::InternalCoords object
               $atom->internal_coords($vic);

               # also accepts array refs
               $atom->internal_coords([8, 1.54, 7, 109.47, 6, 120.0]);

               # also accepts lists
               $atom->internal_coords(8, 1.54, 7, 109.47, 6, 120.0);

           Sets or gets the atom's internal coordinates. It can take as a
           parameter a Chemistry::InternalCoords object, a reference to an
           array, or the list of coordinates. In the last two cases, the list
           elements are the following: atom number or reference for distance,
           distance, atom number or reference for angle, angle in degrees,
           atom number or reference for dihedral, dihedral in degrees.

       $atom->x3, $atom->y3, $atom->z3
           Get the x, y or z 3D coordinate of the atom. This methods are just
           accessors that don't change the coordinates. $atom->x3 is short for
           ($atom->coords->array)[0], and so on.

       $atom->formal_charge($charge)
           Set or get the formal charge of the atom.

       $atom->formal_radical($radical)
           Set or get the formal radical multiplicity for the atom.

       $atom->implicit_hydrogens($h_count)
           Set or get the number of implicit hydrogen atoms bonded to the
           atom.

       $atom->hydrogens($h_count)
           Set or get the number of implicit hydrogen atoms bonded to the atom
           (DEPRECATED: USE "implicit_hydrogens" INSTEAD).

       $atom->total_hydrogens($h_count)
           Get the total number of hydrogen atoms bonded to the atom (implicit
           + explicit).

       $atom->sprout_hydrogens
           Convert all the implicit hydrogens for this atom to explicit
           hydrogens. Note: it does not generate coordinates for the new
           atoms.

       $atom->collapse_hydrogens
           Delete neighboring hydrogen atoms and add them as implicit
           hydrogens for this atom.

       $atom->calc_implicit_hydrogens
           Use heuristics to figure out how many implicit hydrogens should the
           atom have to satisfy its normal "organic" valence. Returns the
           number of hydrogens but does not affect the atom object.

       $atom->add_implicit_hydrogens
           Similar to calc_implicit_hydrogens, but it also sets the number of
           implicit hydrogens in the atom to the new calculated value.
           Equivalent to

               $atom->implicit_hydrogens($atom->calc_implicit_hydrogens);

           It returns the atom object.

       $atom->aromatic($bool)
           Set or get whether the atom is considered to be aromatic. This
           property may be set arbitrarily, it doesn't imply any kind of
           "intelligent aromaticity detection"! (For that, look at the
           Chemistry::Ring module).

       $atom->valence
           Returns the sum of the bond orders of the bonds in which the atom
           participates, including implicit hydrogens (which are assumed to
           have bond orders of one).

       $atom->explicit_valence
           Like "valence", but excluding implicit hydrogen atoms. To get the
           raw number of bonds, without counting bond orders, call
           $atom->bonds in scalar context.

       $atom->delete
           Calls $mol->delete_atom($atom) on the atom's parent molecule.

       $atom->parent
           Returns the atom's containing object (the molecule to which the
           atom belongs).  An atom can only have one parent.

       $atom->neighbors($from)
           Return a list of neighbors. If an atom object $from is specified,
           it will be excluded from the list (this is useful if an atom wants
           to know who its neighbor's neighbors are, without counting itself).

       $atom->bonds($from)
           Return a list of bonds. If an atom object $from is specified, bonds
           to that atom will be excluded from the list.

       $atom->bonds_neighbors($from)
           Return a list of hash references, representing the bonds and
           neighbors from the atom. If an atom object $from is specified, it
           will be excluded from the list.  The elements of the hash are 'to',
           and atom reference, and 'bond', a bond reference. For example,

               for my $bn ($atom->bonds_neighbors) {
                   print "bond $bn->{bond} point to atom $bn->{to}\n";
               }

       ($distance, $closest_atom) = $atom->distance($obj)
           Returns the minimum distance to $obj, which can be an atom, a
           molecule, or a vector. In scalar context it returns only the
           distance; in list context it also returns the closest atom found.
           It can also be called as a function, Chemistry::Atom::distance
           (which can be exported).

       $atom->angle($atom2, $atom3)
           Returns the angle in radians between the atoms involved. $atom2 is
           the atom in the middle. Can also be called as
           Chemistry::Atom::angle($atom1, $atom2, $atom3). This function can
           be exported. Note: if you override this method, you may also need
           to override angle_deg or strange things may happen.

       $atom->angle_deg($atom2, $atom3)
           Same as angle(), but returns the value in degrees. May be exported.

       $atom->dihedral($atom2, $atom3, $atom4)
           Returns the dihedral angle in radians between the atoms involved.
           Can also be called as Chemistry::Atom::dihedral($atom1, $atom2,
           $atom3, $atom4). May be exported. Note: if you override this
           method, you may also need to override dihedral_deg and angle or
           strange things may happen.

       $atom->dihedral_deg($atom2, $atom3, $atom4)
           Same as dihedral(), but returns the value in degrees. May be
           exported.

       $atom->print
           Convert the atom to a string representation (used for debugging).

       my $info = $atom->sprintf($format)
           Format interesting atomic information in a concise way, as
           specified by a printf-like format.

               %s - symbol
               %Z - atomic number
               %n - name
               %q - formal charge
               %h - implicit hydrogen count
               %v - valence
               %i - id
               %8.3m - mass, formatted as %8.3f with core sprintf
               %8.3x - x coordinate, formatted as %8.3f with core sprintf
               %8.3y - y coordinate, formatted as %8.3f with core sprintf
               %8.3z - z coordinate, formatted as %8.3f with core sprintf
               %% - %

       $atom->printf($format)
           Same as $atom->sprintf, but prints to standard output
           automatically. Used for quick and dirty atomic information dumping.
