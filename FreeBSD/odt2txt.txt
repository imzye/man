NAME
       odt2txt - a simple converter from OpenDocument Text to plain text

SYNOPSIS
       odt2txt [OPTIONS] FILENAME

DESCRIPTION
       odt2txt is a command-line tool which extracts the text out of
       OpenDocument Texts, as produced by OpenOffice.org, KOffice, StarOffice
       and others.

       odt2txt can also extract text from some file formats similar to
       OpenDocument Text, such as OpenOffice.org XML (*.sxw), which was used
       by OpenOffice.org version 1.x and older StarOffice versions.  To a
       lesser extent, odt2txt may be useful to extract content from
       OpenDocument spreadsheets (*.ods) and OpenDocument presentations
       (*.odp).

       The FILENAME argument is mandatory.

OPTIONS
       --width=WIDTH
              Wrap text lines after WIDTH characters. The default value is 65,
              which means that any words which would extend beyond column 65
              are moved to a new line.

              If WIDTH is set to -1 then no lines will be broken

       --output=FILE
              Write output to FILE and not to standard output.

       --subst=SUBST
              Select which non-ascii characters shall be replaced by ascii
              look-a-likes. Valid values for SUBST are all, some and none.

              --subst=all Substitute all characters for which substitutions
              are known

              --subst=some Substitute all characters which the output charset
              does not contain This is the default

              --subst=none Substitute no characters

       --encoding=X
              Do not try to autodetect the terminal encoding, but convert the
              document to encoding X unconditionally To find out, which
              terminal encoding will be used in automatic mode, use
              --encoding=show

       --raw  Print raw XML

       --version
              Show version and copyright information
