NAME
       Oldrunner - Broderbund's Loderunner remake

SYNOPSIS
       oldrunner  [-v] [-l<num>]

DESCRIPTION
       Oldrunner is a remake of Broderbund's Loderunner which contains the 150
       original game levels. In order to win a level, the player '@' must
       collect all gold bags '$' without being touched by ennemies (same
       sprite '@' as player but in reverse video). Once all gold is collected
       an escape ladder usually appears and the player must travel to the top
       of the screen to reach the next level. The player can dig holes into
       floors to temporarily trap ennemies and may then safely walk atop them.
       Over time, floors dug into will regenerate, filling in these holes. A
       trapped ennemy who cannot escape a hole before it fills is consumed,
       immediately respawning in a random location at the top of the level.

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       -l <num>
              Start the game at level number num.

       -v     Display oldrunner version and exit.

CONFIGURATION
       The game can be configured by modifying the variables found in the
       cfg.h header file and recompiling. The default keys are the following
       (^X means control and X keys pressed simultaneously):

       h      move left

       l      move right

       k      move up

       j      move down

       s      dig on the left

       d      dig on the right

       ^g     commit suicide

       ^n     go to next level
