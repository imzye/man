        use Text::Table::TinyColorWide qw/ generate_table /;

        my $rows = [
            # header row
            [colored(['bright_green'],'Name'), colored(['bright_green'],'Rank'), colored(['bright_green'],'Serial')],

            ["\x{7231}\x{4E3D}\x{4E1D}", 'pvt', '123456'],
            [colored(['bold'],"\x{9C8D}\x{6B65}"),   'cpl', '98765321'],

DESCRIPTION
       This module is like Text::Table::Tiny (0.04) with added support for
       colored text (text containing ANSI color codes) and wide characters.
       With this module, text with ANSI color codes and/or wide characters
       will still line up.

       Interface, options, and format variables are the same as in
       Text::Table::Tiny.

       dependencies.
