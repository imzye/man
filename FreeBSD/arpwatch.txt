ARPSNMP(8)              FreeBSD System Manager's Manual             ARPSNMP(8)

NAME
     arpsnmp – keep track of ethernet/ip address pairings

SYNOPSIS
     arpsnmp [-dqs] [-D arpdir] [-f datafile] [-w watcher@email]
             [-W watchee@email] file ...

DESCRIPTION
     arpsnmp keeps track of ethernet/ip address pairings. It syslogs activity
     and reports certain changes via email.  arpsnmp reads information from a
     file (usually generated by snmpwalk(3)).

     The format of the input file is the same as arp.dat; the mac address, ip
     address, optional timestamp and optional simple hostname. If the
     timestamp is missing, the current date is used.

     arpsnmp can also be used to merge files.  If the same ethernet/ip address
     pair occurs in more than one file, the timestamp from the last seen is
     saved.

     The -C flag uses compact padded ethernet addresses in arp.dat, e.g.
     0:8:e1:1:2:d6.

     The -d flag is used enable debugging. This also inhibits mailing the
     reports.  Instead, they are sent to stderr.

     The -D flag is used to specify the working directory. This defaults to
     /usr/local/arpwatch.

     The -f flag is used to set the ethernet/ip address database filename.
     The default is arp.dat.

     Note that an empty file must be created before the first time you run

     The -q flag suppresses reports being logged or printed to stderr.

     The -s flag suppresses reports sent by email.

     The -w flag is used to specify the target address for email reports. The
     default is root.

     The -W flag is used specifies the from address for email reports. The
     default is root.

     The -Z flag (default) uses zero padded ethernet addresses in arp.dat,
     e.g. 00:08:e1:01:02:d6.

BUGS
     Please send bug reports to ⟨arpwatch@ee.lbl.gov⟩.

     It doesn't make any sense to feed arpsnmp the arp.dat file.

     Attempts are made to suppress DECnet flip flops but they aren't always
     successful.
