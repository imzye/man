IMAPFILTER(1)           FreeBSD General Commands Manual          IMAPFILTER(1)

NAME
     imapfilter – mail filter

SYNOPSIS
     imapfilter [-inVv] [-c configfile] [-d debugfile] [-e 'command']
                [-l logfile] [-p pidfile] [-t truststore]

DESCRIPTION
     imapfilter is a mail filtering utility. It connects to remote mail
     servers using the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), sends
     searching queries to the server and processes mailboxes based on the
     results. It can be used to delete, copy, move, flag, etc. messages
     residing in mailboxes at the same or different mail servers. The 4rev1
     and 4 versions of the IMAP protocol are supported.

     The command line options of imapfilter(1) are as follows:

     -c configfile
             Path to the configuration file to read, or the ‘-’ character to
             read the configuration from the standard input stream.  The
             default is $HOME/.imapfilter/config.lua.

     -d debugfile
             File that contains debugging information about the full
             communication with the server, along with other inner workings'
             details.

     -e 'command'
             May be used to enter “one line” of configuration, while it is
             also possible to pipe a full configuration as a string.  When
             this option is used, a configuration file will not be loaded.

     -i      Enters interactive mode after executing the configuration file.

     -l logfile
             File that contains logs of error messages produced.

     -n      This option enables the so called dry-run mode, and any actions
             that would result in changes to the server do not actually take
             place. So the requests that would modify any data are not sent to
             the server, even though informational messages about these
             actions are still printed.

             Any other methods, that only receive data from the server, are
             performed as normal, such as for example the searching methods.
             Note, that the number of messages an action is reported to be
             applied upon, might differ between dry-run mode and the normal
             execution, and this is expected as in the latter case the data on
             the server are continuously altered by subsequent actions.

     -t truststore
             The path to the system's SSL CA TrustStore directory or file. SSL
             connections will be validated using the CA certificates found in
             this directory or file, and when this is not possible, the local
             $HOME/.imapfilter/certificates file will be used.  The default CA
             directory is /etc/ssl/certs/, and the default CA file is
             /etc/ssl/cert.pem.

     -p pidfile
             Write the process ID (PID) to this file on startup, and delete it
             on exit.

     -V      Displays version and copyright information.

     -v      Enables printing of some brief details of the communication with
             the server.

ENVIRONMENT
     HOME    User's home directory.

     IMAPFILTER_HOME
             Program's configuration directory, which overrides the default
             $HOME/.imapfilter/.

FILES
     $HOME/.imapfilter/config.lua
             Default configuration file. Because this file may contain
             sensitive data such as user passwords, the recommended
             permissions are read/write for the user, and not accessible by
             others.

     $HOME/.imapfilter/certificates
             File where the SSL certificates are stored.
