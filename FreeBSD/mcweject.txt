EJECT(1)                FreeBSD General Commands Manual               EJECT(1)

NAME
     eject – Eject removable media

SYNOPSIS
     eject [options] <device|mount-point>

DESCRIPTION
     Eject is used to control removable media devices.  Either a device name
     (with or without a precending "/dev/"), or a mount point as listed in
     "/etc/fstab" may be specified to select the device to eject.  If no
     device is specified, the default device, "/etc/acd0" is used.

     If the device is currently mounted at one or more mount points, all are
     unmounted before the eject is performed.  If any unmount fails, the eject
     is aborted, and the mounts are NOT re-established.

     Only devices listed in "/usr/local/etc/eject.allow" can be ejected.  The
     file format is one entry per line, and shell-style wildcards (See
     "sh(1)") are allowed.  Lines beginning with `#' and blank lines are
     considered comments.

OPTIONS
     --h, ---help
                 Display a summary of command usage.

     --v, ---verbose
                 Verbose mode.  eject displays arguably useful information
                 about what it's doing.

     --d, ---default
                 Display the default device.

     --t, ---trayclose
                 Close the CDROM tray.  ( Not supported by all CDROM drives. )

     --n, ---noop
                 No operation.  Display the normal output, but don't actually
                 eject or close the device.  Often used in conjunction with -v
                 for debugging.

EXAMPLES
     Eject the default device:
           eject

           eject cdrom
           eject acd0
           eject /dev/cdrom
           eject /dev/acd0

     Eject using mount point:
           eject /cdrom

     Close tray:
           eject -t /cdrom
           eject --trayclose /cdrom

EXIT STATUS
     eject returns 0 if operation was successful, nonzero otherwise.  See
     sysexits(3) for an explanation of exit codes.
