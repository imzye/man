NAME
     d11amp – simple MP3 player

INTRODUCTION
     d11amp is a frontend to MPG123, trying to resemble WinAmp, utilizing its
     treasure trove of themes. It has been published under the BSD 2-clause
     license.

SYNOPSIS
     d11amp [--help]

     d11amp [--dir=~/.d11amp/] [--audiooutput.portaudio.device=-1]


OPTIONS
     d11amp [--audiooutput.portaudio.device=?]
     d11amp [--audiooutput.portaudio.device=NUMBER]
     The audio output is being handled through the portaudio library. This
     allows one to select any audio output present in the device on which
     d11amp has been started. The outputs are identified through a number, and
     a list of available outputs can be seen by using a question mark instead
     of the number.
     The default audio output device can be addressed by using -1.
