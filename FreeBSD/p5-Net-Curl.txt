NAME
       Net::Curl - Perl interface for libcurl

SYNOPSIS
        use Net::Curl;
        print $Net::Curl::VERSION;

        print Net::Curl::version();

DOCUMENTATION
       Net::Curl provides a Perl interface to libcurl created with object-
       oriented implementations in mind. This documentation contains Perl-
       specific details and quirks. For more information consult libcurl man
       pages and documentation at <http://curl.haxx.se>.

DESCRIPTION
       This package contains some static functions and version-releated
       constants.  It does not export by default anything, but constants can
       be exported upon request.

        use Net::Curl qw(:constants);

       To perform any request you want Net::Curl::Easy.

   FUNCTIONS
       None of those functions are exported, you must use fully qualified
       names.

       version
           Returns libcurl version string.

            my $libcurl_verstr = Net::Curl::version();
            # prints something like:
            # libcurl/7.21.4 GnuTLS/2.10.4 zlib/1.2.5 c-ares/1.7.4 ...
            print $libcurl_verstr;

           Calls curl_version(3)
           <https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_version.html> function.

       version_info
           Returns a hashref with the same information as curl_version_info(3)
           <https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_version_info.html>.

            my $libcurl_ver = Net::Curl::version_info();
            print Dumper( $libcurl_ver );

           Example for version_info with age CURLVERSION_FOURTH:

            age => 3,
            version => '7.21.4',
            version_num => 464132,
            host => 'x86_64-pld-linux-gnu',
            features => 18109,
            ssl_version => 'GnuTLS/2.10.4'
            ssl_version_num => 0,
            libz_version => '1.2.5',
            protocols => [ 'dict', 'file', 'ftp', 'ftps', 'gopher', 'http',
                           'https', 'imap', 'imaps', 'ldap', 'ldaps', 'pop3',
                           'pop3s', 'rtmp', 'rtsp', 'scp', 'sftp', 'smtp',
                           'smtps', 'telnet', 'tftp' ],
            ares => '1.7.4',
            ares_num => 67332,
            libidn => '1.20',
            iconv_ver_num => 0,
            libssh_version => 'libssh2/1.2.7',

           You can import constants if you want to check libcurl features:

            use Net::Curl qw(:constants);
            my $vi = Net::Curl::version_info();
            unless ( $vi->{features} & CURL_VERSION_SSL ) {
                die "SSL support is required\n";
            }

       getdate
           Decodes date string returning its numerical value, in seconds.

            my $time = Net::Curl::getdate( "GMT 08:49:37 06-Nov-94 Sunday" );
            my $timestr = gmtime $time;
            print "$timestr\n";
            # Sun Nov  6 08:49:37 1994

           See curl_getdate(3)
           <https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_getdate.html> for more info on
           supported input formats.

   CONSTANTS
       CURL_VERSION_* and CURLVERSION_*
           Can be used for decoding version_info() values.
           curl_version_info(3)
           <https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_version_info.html>

       LIBCURL_*
           Can be used for determining buildtime libcurl version. Some
           Net::Curl features will not be available if it was built with older
           libcurl, even if runtime libcurl version has necessary features.

STATUS
       Implemented interface is solid, there should be no more changes to it.
       Only new features will be added.

       This package tries very hard to not allow user do anything that could
       make libcurl crash, but there still may be some corner cases where that
       happens.

       This package was mostly rewritten by Przemyslaw Iskra <sparky at

HISTORY
       Module started as an extension to WWW::Curl developed by Cris Bailiff
       <c.bailiff+curl at devsecure.com>, Balint Szilakszi <szbalint at
       cpan.org> and a long list of contributors. However, currently it shares
       no common code.
