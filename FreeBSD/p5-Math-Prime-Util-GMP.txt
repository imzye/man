DESCRIPTION
       A module for number theory in Perl using GMP.  This includes primality
       tests, getting primes in a range, factoring, and more.

       While it certainly can be used directly, the main purpose of this
       module is for Math::Prime::Util.  That module will automatically load
       this one if it is installed, greatly speeding up many of its operations
       on big numbers.

       Inputs and outputs for big numbers are via strings, so you do not need
       to use a bigint package in your program.  However if you do use
       bigints, inputs will be converted internally so there is no need to
       convert before a call.  Output results are returned as either Perl
       scalars (for native-size) or strings (for bigints).  Math::Prime::Util
       tries to reconvert all strings back into the callers bigint type if
       possible, which makes it more convenient for calculations.

       The various "is_*_pseudoprime" tests are more appropriately called
       "is_*_probable_prime" or "is_*_prp".  They return 1 if the input is a
       probable prime based on their test.  The naming convention is
       historical and follows Pari, Math::Primality, and some other math
       packages.  The modern definition of pseudoprime is a composite that
       passes the test, rather than any number.

FUNCTIONS
   is_prob_prime
         my $prob_prime = is_prob_prime($n);
         # Returns 0 (composite), 2 (prime), or 1 (probably prime)

       Takes a positive number as input and returns back either 0 (composite),
       2 (definitely prime), or 1 (probably prime).

       For inputs below "2^64" the test is deterministic, so the possible
       return values are 0 (composite) or 2 (definitely prime).

       For inputs above "2^64", a probabilistic test is performed.  Only 0
       (composite) and 1 (probably prime) are returned.  The current
       implementation uses the Baillie-PSW (BPSW) test.  There is a
       possibility that composites may be returned marked prime, but since the
       test was published in 1980, not a single BPSW pseudoprime has been
       found, so it is extremely likely to be prime.  While we believe
       (Pomerance 1984) that an infinite number of counterexamples exist,
       there is a weak conjecture (Martin) that none exist under 10000 digits.

       In more detail, we are using the extra-strong Lucas test (Grantham
       2000) using the Baillie parameter selection method (see OEIS A217719).
       Previous versions of this module used the strong Lucas test with
       Selfridge parameters, but the extra-strong version produces fewer
       pseudoprimes while running 1.2 - 1.5x faster.  It is slightly stronger
       than the test used in Pari <http://pari.math.u-
       bordeaux.fr/faq.html#primetest>.

   is_prime
         say "$n is prime!" if is_prime($n);

       Takes a positive number as input and returns back either 0 (composite),
       2 (definitely prime), or 1 (probably prime).  Composites will act
       exactly like "is_prob_prime", as will numbers less than "2^64".  For
       numbers larger than "2^64", some additional tests are performed on
       probable primes to see if they can be proven by another means.

       This call walks the line between the performance of "is_prob_prime" and
       the certainty of "is_provable_prime".  Those calls may be more
       appropriate in some cases.  What this function does is give most of the
       performance of the former, while adding more certainty.  For finer
       tuning of this tradeoff, you may instead use "is_prob_prime" followed
       by additional probable prime tests such as "miller_rabin_random" and/or
       "is_frobenius_underwood_pseudoprime".

       As with "is_prob_prime", a BPSW test is first performed.  This is
       deterministic for all 64-bit numbers.  Next, if the number is a Proth
       or LLR form, then a proof is constructed.  If the result is still
       "probably prime" and the input is smaller than the Sorenson/Webster
       (2015) deterministic Miller-Rabin limit (approximately 82 bits) then
       the 11 or 12 Miller-Rabin tests are performed and the result is
       confirmed.  For larger inputs that are still "probably prime" but under
       200 bits, a quick BLS75 "n-1" primality proof is attempted.  This is
       tuned to give up if the result cannot be quickly determined, and
       results in success rates of ~80% at 80 bits, ~30% at 128 bits, and ~13%
       at 160 bits.  Lastly, for results still "probably prime", an additional
       random-base Miller-Rabin test is performed.

       The result is that many numbers will return 2 (definitely prime), and
       the numbers that return 1 (probably prime) have gone through more tests
       than "is_prob_prime" while not taking too long.

       For cryptographic key generation, you may want even more testing for
       probable primes (NIST recommends a few more additional M-R tests than
       we perform).  The function "miller_rabin_random" is made for this.
       Alternately, a different test such as
       "is_frobenius_underwood_pseudoprime" can be used.  Even better, use
       "is_provable_prime" which should be reasonably fast for sizes under
       2048 bits.  Typically for key generation one wants random primes, and
       there are many functions for that.

   is_provable_prime
         say "$n is definitely prime!" if is_provable_prime($n) == 2;

       Takes a positive number as input and returns back either 0 (composite),
       2 (definitely prime), or 1 (probably prime).  A great deal of effort is
       taken to return either 0 or 2 for all numbers.

       The current method first uses BPSW to find composites and provide a
       deterministic answer for tiny numbers (under "2^64").  If no
       certificate is required, LLR and Proth tests can be run, and small
       numbers (under approximately "2^82") can be satisfied with a
       deterministic Miller-Rabin test.  If the result is still not
       determined, a quick  BLS75 "n-1" test is attempted, followed by ECPP.

       The time required for primes of different input sizes on a circa-2009
       workstation averages about "3ms" for 30-digits, "5ms" for 40-digit,
       "20ms" for 60-digit, "50ms" for 80-digit, "100ms" for 100-digit, "2s"
       for 200-digit, and 400-digit inputs about a minute.  Expect a lot of
       time variation for larger inputs.  You can see progress indication if
       verbose is turned on (some at level 1, and a lot at level 2).

       A certificate can be obtained along with the result using the
       "is_provable_prime_with_cert" method.  There is no appreciable extra
       performance cost for returning a certificate.

   is_provable_prime_with_cert
       Takes a positive number as input and returns back an array with two
       elements.  The result will be one of:

         (0, '')      The input is composite.

         (1, '')      The input is probably prime but we could not prove it.
                      This is a failure in our ability to factor some necessary
                      element in a reasonable time, not a significant proof
                      failure (in other words, it remains a probable prime).

         (2, '...')   The input is prime, and the certificate contains all the
                      information necessary to verify this.

       The certificate is a text representation containing all the necessary
       information to verify the primality of the input in a reasonable time.
       The result can be used with "verify_prime" in Math::Prime::Util for
       verification.  Proof types used include:

         ECPP
         BLS3
         BLS15
         BLS5
         Small

   is_pseudoprime
       Takes a positive number "n" and one or more non-zero positive bases as
       input.  Returns 1 if the input is a probable prime to each base, 0 if
       not.  This is the simple Fermat primality test.  Removing primes, given
       base 2 this produces the sequence OEIS A001567
       <http://oeis.org/A001567>.

   is_euler_pseudoprime
       Takes a positive number "n" and one or more non-zero positive bases as
       input.  Returns 1 if the input is an Euler probable prime to each base,
       0 if not.  This is the Euler test, sometimes called the Euler-Jacobi
       test.  Removing primes, given base 2 this produces the sequence OEIS
       A047713 <http://oeis.org/A047713>.

   is_strong_pseudoprime
         my $maybe_prime = is_strong_pseudoprime($n, 2);
         my $probably_prime = is_strong_pseudoprime($n, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17);

       Takes a positive number "n" and one or more non-zero positive bases as
       input.  Returns 1 if the input is a strong probable prime to each base,
       0 if not.  This is often called the Miller-Rabin test.

       If 0 is returned, then the number really is a composite.  If 1 is
       returned, then it is either a prime or a strong pseudoprime to all the
       given bases.  Given enough distinct bases, the chances become very
       strong that the number is actually prime.

       Both the input number and the bases may be big integers.  If base
       modulo n <= 1 or base modulo n = n-1, then the result will be 1.  This
       allows the bases to be larger than n if desired, while still returning
       meaningful results.  For example,

         is_strong_pseudoprime(367, 1101)

       would incorrectly return 0 if this was not done properly.  A 0 result
       should be returned only if n is composite, regardless of the base.

       This is usually used in combination with other tests to make either
       stronger tests (e.g. the strong BPSW test) or deterministic results for
       numbers less than some verified limit (e.g. Jaeschke showed in 1993
       that no more than three selected bases are required to give correct
       primality test results for any 32-bit number).  Given the small chances
       of passing multiple bases, there are some math packages that just use
       multiple MR tests for primality testing, though in the early 1990s
       almost all serious software switched to the BPSW test.

       Even numbers other than 2 will always return 0 (composite).  While the
       algorithm works with even input, most sources define it only on odd
       input.  Returning composite for all non-2 even input makes the function
       match most other implementations including Math::Primality's
       "is_strong_pseudoprime" function.

   miller_rabin_random
         my $maybe_prime = miller_rabin_random($n, 10); # 10 random bases

       Takes a positive number ("n") as input and a positive number ("k") of
       bases to use.  Performs "k" Miller-Rabin tests using uniform random
       bases between 2 and "n-2".  This is the correct way to perform "k"
       Miller-Rabin tests, rather than the common but broken method of using
       the first "k" primes.

       An optional third argument may be given, which is a seed to use.  The
       seed should be a number either in decimal, binary with a leading "0b",
       hex with a leading "0x", or octal with a leading 0.  It will be
       converted to a GMP integer, so may be large.  Typically this is not
       necessary, but cryptographic applications may prefer the ability to use
       this, and it allows repeatable test results.

       There is no check for duplicate bases.  Input sizes below 65 bits make
       little sense for this function since is_prob_prime is deterministic at
       that size.  For numbers of 65+ bits, the chance of duplicate bases is
       quite small.  The exponentiation approximation for the birthday problem
       gives a probability of less than 2e-16 for 100 random bases to have a
       duplicate with a 65-bit input, and less than 2e-35 with a 128-bit
       input.

   is_lucas_pseudoprime
   is_strong_lucas_pseudoprime
       Takes a positive number as input, and returns 1 if the input is a
       standard or strong Lucas probable prime.  The Selfridge method of
       choosing D, P, and Q are used (some sources call this a Lucas-Selfridge
       test).  This is one half of the BPSW primality test (the Miller-Rabin
       strong probable prime test with base 2 being the other half).  The
       canonical BPSW test (page 1401 of Baillie and Wagstaff (1980)) uses the
       strong Lucas test with Selfridge parameters, but in practice a variety
       of Lucas tests with different parameters are used by tests calling
       themselves BPSW.

       The standard Lucas test implemented here corresponds to the Lucas test
       described in FIPS 186-4 section C.3.3, though uses a slightly more
       efficient calculation.  Since the standard Lucas-Selfridge test is a
       subset of the strong Lucas-Selfridge test, I recommend using the strong
       test rather than the standard test for cryptographic purposes.  It is
       often slightly faster, has over 4x fewer pseudoprimes, and is the
       method recommended by Baillie and Wagstaff in their 1980 paper.

   is_extra_strong_lucas_pseudoprime
       Takes a positive number as input, and returns 1 if the input is an
       extra-strong Lucas probable prime.  This is defined in Grantham (2000),
       and is a slightly more stringent test than the strong Lucas test,
       though because different parameters are used the pseudoprimes are not a
       subset.  As expected by the extra conditions, the number of
       pseudoprimes is less than 2/3 that of the strong Lucas-Selfridge test.
       Runtime performance is 1.2 to 1.5x faster than the strong Lucas test.

       The parameters are selected using the Baillie-OEIS method:

         P = 3;
         Q = 1;
         while ( jacobi( P*P-4, n ) != -1 )
           P += 1;

   is_almost_extra_strong_lucas_pseudoprime
       Takes a positive number as input and returns 1 if the input is an
       "almost" extra-strong Lucas probable prime.  This is the classic extra-
       strong Lucas test but without calculating the U sequence.  This makes
       it very fast, although as the input increases in size the time
       converges to the conventional extra-strong implementation:  at 30
       digits this routine is about 15% faster, at 300 digits it is only 2%
       faster.

       With the current implementations, there is little reason to prefer this
       unless trying to reproduce specific results.  The extra-strong
       implementation has been optimized to use similar features, removing
       most of the performance advantage.

       An optional second argument (must be between 1 and 256) indicates the
       increment amount for P parameter selection.  The default value of one
       yields the method described in "is_extra_strong_lucas_pseudoprime".  A
       value of 2 yields the method used in Pari <http://pari.math.u-
       bordeaux.fr/faq.html#primetest>.

       Because the "U = 0" condition is ignored, this produces about 5% more
       pseudoprimes than the extra-strong Lucas test.  However this is still
       only 66% of the number produced by the strong Lucas-Selfridge test.  No
       BPSW counterexamples have been found with any of the Lucas tests
       described.

   is_euler_plumb_pseudoprime
       Takes a positive number "n" as input and returns 1 if "n" passes Colin
       Plumb's Euler Criterion primality test.  Pseudoprimes to this test are
       a subset of the base 2 Fermat and Euler tests, but a superset of the
       base 2 strong pseudoprime (Miller-Rabin) test.

       The main reason for this test is that is a bit more efficient than
       other probable prime tests.

   is_perrin_pseudoprime
       Takes a positive number "n" as input and returns 1 if "n" divides P(n)
       where P(n) is the Perrin number of "n".  The Perrin sequence is defined
       by "P(n) = P(n-2) + P(n-3)" with "P(0) = 3, P(1) = 0, P(2) = 2".

       This is not a commonly used test, as it runs slower than most of the
       other probable prime tests and offers little benefit, especially over
       combined tests like "is_bpsw_prime",
       "is_frobenius_underwood_pseudoprime", and
       "is_frobenius_khashin_pseudoprime".

       An optional second argument "r" indicates whether to run additional
       tests.  With "r=1", "P(-n) = -1 mod n" is also verified, creating the
       "minimal restricted" test.  With "r=2", the full signature is also
       tested using the Adams and Shanks (1982) rules (without the quadratic
       form test).  With "r=3", the full signature is tested using the
       Grantham (2000) test, which additionally does not allow pseudoprimes to
       be divisible by 2 or 23.  The minimal restricted pseudoprime sequence
       is OEIS A018187 <http://oeis.org/A018187>.

   is_frobenius_pseudoprime
       Takes a positive number "n" as input, and two optional parameters "a"
       and "b", and returns 1 if the "n" is a Frobenius probable prime with
       respect to the polynomial "x^2 - ax + b".  Without the parameters, "b =
       2" and "a" is the least positive odd number such that "(a^2-4b|n) =
       -1".  This selection has no pseudoprimes below "2^64" and none known.
       In any case, the discriminant "a^2-4b" must not be a perfect square.

   is_frobenius_underwood_pseudoprime
       Takes a positive number as input, and returns 1 if the input passes the
       efficient Frobenius test of Paul Underwood.  This selects a parameter
       "a" as the least non-negative integer such that "(a^2-4|n)=-1", then
       verifies that "(x+2)^(n+1) = 2a + 5 mod (x^2-ax+1,n)".  This combines a
       Fermat and Lucas test at a computational cost of about 2.5x a strong
       pseudoprime test.  This makes it similar to, but faster than, a
       standard Frobenius test.

       This test is deterministic (no randomness is used).  There are no known
       pseudoprimes to this test.  This test also has no overlap with the BPSW
       test, making it a very effective method for adding additional
       certainty.

   is_frobenius_khashin_pseudoprime
       Takes a positive number as input, and returns 1 if the input passes the
       Frobenius test of Sergey Khashin.  This ensures "n" is not a perfect
       square, selects the parameter "c" as the smallest odd prime such that
       "(c|n)=-1", then verifies that "(1+D)^n = (1-D) mod n" where "D =
       sqrt(c) mod n".

       This test is deterministic (no randomness is used).  There are no known
       pseudoprimes to this test.

   is_bpsw_prime
       Given a positive number input, returns 0 (composite), 2 (definitely
       prime), or 1 (probably prime), using the BPSW primality test (extra-
       strong variant).

       This function does the extra-strong BPSW test and nothing more.  That
       is, it will skip all pretests and any extra work that the
       "is_prob_prime" test may add.  This saves some time if the input has no
       small factors, such as testing results that have been sieved.

   is_aks_prime
         say "$n is definitely prime" if is_aks_prime($n);

       Takes a positive number as input, and returns 1 if the input passes the
       Agrawal-Kayal-Saxena (AKS) primality test.  This is a deterministic
       unconditional primality test which runs in polynomial time for general
       input.

       The particular method used is theorem 4.1 from Bernstein (2003).  This
       is substantially faster than the original AKS publication, the later
       version with improvements by Lenstra (sometimes called the V6 paper),
       or the later improvements of Voloch and Bornemann.  It is, by a large
       order, faster than any other known implementation as of early 2017.

       For theoretical analysis of the primality task, AKS is extremely
       important.  In practice, it is essentially useless.  Estimated run time
       for a 150 digit input is over 2 days, making the case that while the
       algorithmic complexity growth is polynomial, the constants are
       extremely high.  It will take years for for numbers that ECPP or APR-CL
       can prove in seconds.

       With the "verbose" option set to 1, the chosen "r" and "s" values are
       printed before the test starts.  With "verbose" set to 2 or higher,
       each of the "s" tests results in a "." output as the test runs,
       allowing progress to be monitored.

       Typically you should use "is_provable_prime" and let it decide the
       method.

   is_mersenne_prime
         say "2^607-1 (M607) is a Mersenne prime" if is_mersenne_prime(607);

       Takes a positive number "p" as input and returns 1 if "2^p-1" is prime.
       After some pre-testing, the Lucas-Lehmer test is performed.  This is a
       deterministic unconditional test that runs very fast compared to other
       primality methods for numbers of comparable size, and vastly faster
       than any known general-form primality proof methods.

   is_llr_prime
       Takes a positive number "n" as input and returns one of: 0 (definitely
       composite), 2 (definitely prime), or -1 (test does not indicate
       anything).  This implements the Lucas-Lehmer-Riesel test for fast
       deterministic primality testing on numbers of the form "k * 2^n - 1".
       If the input is not of this form or if "k >= 2^n" then -1 will be
       returned as the test does not apply.  If "k = 1" then this is a
       Mersenne number and the Lucas-Lehmer test is used.  Otherwise, the LLR
       test is performed.  While not as fast as the Lucas-Lehmer test for
       Mersenne numbers, it is almost as fast as a single strong pseudoprime
       test (i.e.  Miller-Rabin test) while giving a certain answer.

   is_proth_prime
       Takes a positive number "n" as input and returns one of: 0 (definitely
       composite), 2 (definitely prime), or -1 (test does not indicate
       anything).  This applies Proth's theorem for fast Las Vegas primality
       testing on numbers of the form "k * 2^n + 1".  If the input is not of
       this form or if "k >= 2^n" then -1 will be returned as the test does
       not apply.  Otherwise, a search is performed to find a quadratic
       nonresidue modulo "n".  If none can be found after a brief search, -1
       is returned as no conclusion can be reached.  Otherwise, Proth's
       theorem is checked which conclusively indicates primality.  While not
       as fast as the Lucas-Lehmer test for Mersenne numbers, it is almost as
       fast as a single strong pseudoprime test (i.e.  Miller-Rabin test)
       while giving a certain answer.

   is_gaussian_prime
       Given two integers "a" and "b" as input, returns 0 (definitely
       composite), 1 (probably prime), or 2 (definitely prime) to indicate
       whether the complex number "a+bi" is a Guassian prime.  The "is_prime"
       function is used internally to make the determination.

   is_miller_prime
         say "$n is definitely prime" if is_miller_prime($n);
         say "$n is definitely prime assuming the GRH" if is_miller_prime($n, 1);

       Takes a positive number as input, and returns 1 if the input passes the
       deterministic Miller test.  An optional second argument indicates
       whether the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis should be assumed, and
       defaults to 0.  Setting the verbose flag to 2 or higher will show how
       many bases are used.  The unconditional test is exponential time, while
       the conditional test (assuming the GRH) is polynomial time.

       This is a very slow method in practice, and generally should not be
       used.  The asymptotic complexity of the GRH version is good in theory,
       matching ECPP, but in practice it is much slower.  The number of bases
       used by the unconditional test grows quite rapidly, impractically many
       past about 160 bits, and overflows a 64-bit integer at 456 bits --
       sizes that are trivial for the unconditional APR-CL and ECPP tests.

   is_nminus1_prime
         say "$n is definitely prime" if is_nminus1_prime($n);

       Takes a positive number as input, and returns 1 if the input passes
       either theorem 5 or theorem 7 of the Brillhart-Lehmer-Selfridge
       primality test.  This is a deterministic unconditional primality test
       which requires factoring "n-1" to a linear factor less than the cube
       root of the input.  For small inputs (under 40 digits) this is
       typically very easy, and some numbers will naturally lead to this being
       very fast.  As the input grows, this method slows down rapidly.

       This method is most appropriate for numbers of the form "k+1" where "k"
       can be easily factored.  Typically you should use "is_provable_prime"
       and let it decide the method.

   is_nplus1_prime
       Takes a positive number as input, and returns 1 if the input passes
       either theorem 17 or theorem 19 of the Brillhart-Lehmer-Selfridge
       primality test.  This is a deterministic unconditional primality test
       which requires factoring "n+1" to a linear factor less than the cube
       root of the input.  For small inputs (under 40 digits) this is
       typically very easy, and some numbers will naturally lead to this being
       very fast.  As the input grows, this method slows down rapidly.

       Disregarding factoring, this is slightly slower than the "n-1" methods.
       It is most appropriate for numbers of the form "k-1" where "k" can be
       easily factored.

   is_bls75_prime
       Takes a positive number as input, and returns 1 if the input passes one
       of the tests from the Brillhart-Lehmer-Selfridge (1975) paper.  These
       use partial factoring of "n-1" and "n+1".  Currently the implementation
       will use one of:

         N-1   Corollary 1, Theorem 5, Theorem 7
         N+1   Corollary 8, Theorem 17, Theorem 19
         Comb  Theorem 20

       This is appropriate for cases where either "n-1" or "n+1" can be easily
       factored, or when both of them have many small factors.

   is_ecpp_prime
         say "$n is definitely prime" if is_ecpp_prime($n);

       Takes a positive number as input, and returns 1 if the input passes the
       ECPP primality test.  This is the Atkin-Morain Elliptic Curve Primality
       Proving algorithm.  It is the fastest primality proving method in
       Math::Prime::Util.

       This implementation uses a "factor all strategy" (FAS) with
       backtracking.  A limited set of about 500 precalculated discriminants
       are used, which works well for inputs up to 300 digits, and for many
       inputs up to one thousand digits.  Having a larger set will help with
       large numbers (a set of 2650 is available on github in the "xt/"
       directory).  A future implementation may include code to generate class
       polynomials as needed.

       Typically you should use "is_provable_prime" and let it decide the
       method.

   primes
         my $aref1 = primes( 1_000_000 );
         my $aref2 = primes( 2 ** 448, 2 ** 448 + 10000 );
         say join ",", @{primes( 2**2048, 2**2048 + 10000 )};

       Returns all the primes between the lower and upper limits (inclusive),
       with a lower limit of 2 if none is given.

       An array reference is returned, matching the signature of the function
       of the same name in Math::Prime::Util.

       Values above 64-bit are extra-strong BPSW probable primes.

   prime_count
       Returns the number of primes between 2 and "n" (single argument) or
       "lo" and "hi" given two arguments.  The values are inclusive.

       The method is simple sieving followed by primality testing.  This is
       appropriate for small ranges and is useful for very large arguments.
       The Math::Prime::Util module has much more sophisticated methods for
       64-bit arguments.

   prime_count_lower
   prime_count_upper
       Returns lower or upper bounds for the prime count of the input "n".

       Bounds use Dusart 2010, Büthe 2014, Büthe 2015, and Axler 2017.

   sieve_primes
         my @primes = sieve_primes(2**100, 2**100 + 10000);
         my @candidates = sieve_primes(2**1000, 2**1000 + 10000, 40000);

       Given two arguments "low" and "high", this returns the primes in the
       interval (inclusive) as a list.  It operates similar to primes, though
       must always have an lower and upper bound and returns a list.

       With three arguments "low", "high", and "limit", this does a partial
       sieve over the inclusive range and returns the list that pass the
       sieve.  If "limit" is less than 2 then it is identical to the two-
       argument version, in that a primality test will be performed after
       sieving.  Otherwise, sieving is performed up to "limit".

       The two-argument version is typically only used internally and adds
       little functionality.  The three-argument version is quite useful for
       applications that want to apply their own primality or other tests, and
       wish to have a list of values in the range with no small factors.  This
       is quite common for applications involving prime gaps.

       Also see "sieve_range".

   sieve_range
         my @candidates = sieve_range(2**1000, 10000, 40000);

       Given a start value "n", and native unsigned integers "width" and
       "depth", a sieve of maximum depth "depth" is done for the "width"
       consecutive numbers beginning with "n".  An array of offsets from the
       start is returned.

       The returned list contains those offsets in the range "n" to
       "n+width-1" where "n + offset" has no prime factors less than "depth".

       This function is very similar to the three argument form of
       "sieve_primes".  The differences are using "(n,width)" instead of
       "(low,high)", and most importantly returning small offsets from the
       start value rather than the values themselves.  This can substantially
       reduce overhead for multi-thousand digit numbers.

   sieve_twin_primes
         my @primes = sieve_twin_primes(2**1000, 2**1000 + 500000);

       Given two arguments "low" and "high", this returns each lower twin
       prime in the interval (inclusive).  The result is a list, not a
       reference.

       This does a partial sieve of the range, removes any non-twin
       candidates, then checks that each pair are both BPSW probable primes.
       This is substantially more efficient than sieving for all primes
       followed by removing those that are not twin primes.

   sieve_prime_cluster
         # Find some prime septuplets
         my @s = sieve_prime_cluster(2**100, 2**100+1e12, 2,6,8,12,18,20);

       Efficiently finds prime clusters between the first two arguments "low"
       and "high" (inclusive).  The remaining arguments describe the cluster.
       The cluster values must be even, less than 31 bits, and strictly
       increasing.  Given a cluster set "C", the returned values are all
       primes in the range where "p+c" is prime for all "c" in the cluster set
       "C".

       The cluster is described as offsets from 0, with the implicit prime at
       0.  Hence an empty list is asking for all primes (the cluster "p+0").
       A list with the single value 2 will find all twin primes (the cluster
       where "p+0" and "p+2" are prime).  The list "2,6,8" will find prime
       quadruplets.  Note that there is no requirement that the list denote a
       constellation (a cluster with minimal distance) -- the list "42,92,606"
       is just fine.

       For long clusters, e.g. OEIS series A213601 <http://oeis.org/A213601>
       prime 12-tuplets, this will be immensely more efficient than filtering
       out the cluster from a list of primes.  For that example, a range of
       "10^13" takes less than a second to search -- thousands of times faster
       than filtering results from primes or twin primes.  Shorter clusters
       are not quite this efficient, and the overhead for returning large
       arrays should not be ignored.

   next_prime
         $n = next_prime($n);

       Returns the prime following the input number (the smallest prime number
       that is greater than the input number).  The function "is_prob_prime"
       is used to determine when a prime is found, hence the result is a
       probable prime (using BPSW).

       For large inputs this function is quite a bit faster than GMP's
       "mpz_nextprime" or Pari's "nextprime".

   prev_prime
         $n = prev_prime($n);

       Returns the prime preceding the input number (the largest prime number
       that is less than the input number).  0 is returned if the input is 2
       or lower.  The function "is_prob_prime" is used to determine when a
       prime is found, hence the result is a probable prime (using BPSW).

   surround_primes
         ($dprev, $dnext) = surround_primes($n);

       Returns the distances to the previous and next primes of the input "n".
       This is slightly more efficient than calling both "prev_prime" and
       "next_prime", and returning the distances as native integers is more
       efficient with large inputs.

       If an optional second argument "d" is given, and the input "n" is
       larger than "2^64", then if a SPSP-2 is found in the range "n-d" to
       "n+d" (inclusive) then it will be returned with the other argument set
       to 0.  Otherwise, the first SPSP-2 values found are returned.  This
       feature is especially useful for prime gap searches as well as finding
       the nearest prime to a value.

       Note that with a non-zero second argument, the values returned have not
       undergone a full BPSW test; just sieving and a SPSP-2 test.

   next_twin_prime
       Returns the start of the next twin prime after the input "n".  The
       returned value will always be greater than the input.  For a return
       value of "t", both "t" and "t+2" will be a probable prime (using BPSW).

   random_nbit_prime
         say "random 512-bit prime: ", random_nbit_prime(512);

       Returns a randomly selected prime of exactly "n" bits.  "undef" is
       returned if "n" is less than 2.  The returned prime has passed the
       "is_prob_prime" (extra strong BPSW) test.

   random_safe_prime
       Returns a randomly selected safe prime of exactly "n" bits.  "n" must
       be at least 3.  The returned value "p" will be of the form "2q+1" where
       "q" has passed the extra strong BPSW test.  "p" is guaranteed to be a
       prime if "q" is prime.

       Setting verbose level to 3 or higher will produce progress output not
       unlike openssl.  A "." for each candidate that passes pretests, a "+"
       for those where one is likely prime, and "*" when both are likely prime
       with only confirmation tests remaining.

       This generates safe primes about 4-10x faster than openssl's dhparam.

   random_strong_prime
         say "random 512-bit strong prime: ", random_strong_prime(512);

       Returns a randomly selected strong prime of exactly "n" bits.  "n" must
       be at least 256.  The returned prime has passed the "is_prob_prime"
       (extra strong BPSW) test.

       Given the returned prime "p", "p+1", "q=p-1", and "q-1" will all have a
       large factor.  This makes using factoring methods such as p-1 and p+1
       much harder.  Gordon's algorithm is used.  The value of using strong
       primes is questionable over proper random primes when the number of
       bits is at least 1024.

   random_ndigit_prime
         say "random 200-digit prime: ", random_ndigit_prime(200);

       Returns a randomly selected prime of exactly "n" digits.  "undef" is
       returned if "n" is less than 1.  The returned prime has passed the
       "is_prob_prime" (extra strong BPSW) test.

   random_prime
         say random_prime(1000, 2000);  # prime between 1000 and 2000 inclusive

       Returns a random prime in the interval "[a,b]" or "undef" if no prime
       is in the range.  The returned prime has passed the "is_prob_prime"
       (extra strong BPSW) test.

       The random prime functions use the internal CSPRNG for randomness.
       This is currently ISAAC-32 but will likely change to ChaCha20 in a
       later release.

       This corresponds to Mathematica's "RandomPrime[{min,max}]" function.
       This is a superset of Pari's randomprime(n) function, where our
       interval API is more convenient for cryptographic functions.

   random_maurer_prime
         say "random 512-bit proven prime: ", random_maurer_prime(512);

       Returns an n-bit proven prime using Ueli Maurer's FastPrime algorithm
       (1995).  This results in uniform random selection of a proven prime,
       though not every n-bit prime can be generated with this algorithm.

       "undef" is returned if "n" is less than 2.  As a safety check,
       internally the extra strong BPSW test is additionally run on each
       intermediate and the final result.

   random_shawe_taylor_prime
         say "random 512-bit proven prime: ", random_shawe_taylor_prime(512);

       Returns an n-bit proven prime using the Shawe-Taylor algorithm (1986)
       from section C.6 of FIPS 186-4, although using our CSPRNG rather than
       SHA-256.  This is a slightly simpler and older (1986) method than
       Maurer's algorithm.  It is a bit faster than Maurer's method but has a
       smaller subset of returned primes.

       "undef" is returned if "n" is less than 2.  As a safety check,
       internally the extra strong BPSW test is additionally run on each
       intermediate and the final result.

   random_maurer_prime_with_cert
       Like "random_maurer_prime" but also returns a string certificate.

   random_shawe_taylor_prime_with_cert
       Like "random_shawe_taylor_prime" but also returns a string certificate.

   lucasu
         say "Fibonacci($_) = ", lucasu(1,-1,$_) for 0..100;

       Given integers "P", "Q", and the non-negative integer "k", computes
       "U_k" for the Lucas sequence defined by "P","Q".  These include the
       Fibonacci numbers ("1,-1"), the Pell numbers ("2,-1"), the Jacobsthal
       numbers ("1,-2"), the Mersenne numbers ("3,2"), and more.

       This corresponds to OpenPFGW's "lucasU" function and gmpy2's "lucasu"
       function.

   lucasv
         say "Lucas($_) = ", lucasv(1,-1,$_) for 0..100;

       Given integers "P", "Q", and the non-negative integer "k", computes
       "V_k" for the Lucas sequence defined by "P","Q".  These include the
       Lucas numbers ("1,-1").

       This corresponds to OpenPFGW's "lucasV" function and gmpy2's "lucasv"
       function.

   lucas_sequence
         my($U, $V, $Qk) = lucas_sequence($n, $P, $Q, $k)

       Computes "U_k", "V_k", and "Q_k" for the Lucas sequence defined by
       "P","Q", modulo "n".  The modular Lucas sequence is used in a number of
       primality tests and proofs.

       The following conditions must hold:
         - "D = P*P - 4*Q  !=  0"
         - "P > 0"
         - "P < n"
         - "Q < n"
         - "k >= 0"
         - "n >= 2"

   primorial
         $p = primorial($n);

       Given an unsigned integer argument, returns the product of the prime
       numbers which are less than or equal to "n".  This definition of "n#"
       follows OEIS series A034386 <http://oeis.org/A034386> and Wikipedia:
       Primorial definition for natural numbers
       <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primorial#Definition_for_natural_numbers>.

   pn_primorial
         $p = pn_primorial($n)

       Given an unsigned integer argument, returns the product of the first
       "n" prime numbers.  This definition of "p_n#" follows OEIS series
       A002110 <http://oeis.org/A002110> and Wikipedia: Primorial definition
       for prime numbers
       <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primorial#Definition_for_prime_numbers>.

       The two are related with the relationships:

         pn_primorial($n)  ==   primorial( nth_prime($n) )
         primorial($n)     ==   pn_primorial( prime_count($n) )

   factorial
       Given positive integer argument "n", returns the factorial of "n",
       defined as the product of the integers 1 to "n" with the special case
       of "factorial(0) = 1".  This corresponds to Pari's factorial(n) and
       Mathematica's "Factorial[n]" functions.

   multifactorial
       Given two positive integer arguments "n" and "m", returns "n!^(m)", the
       multifactorial.  "m=1" is the standard "factorial" while "m=2" is the
       double factorial.  While the factorial is the product of all integers
       "n" and below, the multifactorial skips those without the same parity
       as "n mod m".  Hence

         multifactorial(n,2) = n * (n-2) * (n-4) * ...

       The multifactorials are the OEIS series (m=1) OEIS series A000142
       <http://oeis.org/A000142>, (m=2) OEIS series A006882
       <http://oeis.org/A006882>, (m=3) OEIS series A007661
       <http://oeis.org/A007661>, (m=4) OEIS series A007662

       <http://oeis.org/wiki/User:Peter_Luschny/Multifactorials>.

   factorialmod
       Given two positive integer arguments "n" and "m", returns "n! mod m".
       This is much faster than computing the large factorial(n) followed by a
       mod operation.

   factorial_sum
       Given positive integer argument "n", returns the factorial sum of "n".
       This is defined as the sum of factorial(k) for "0 .. n-1".  These are
       equivalent, though this function is faster:

         factorial_sum($n) == vecsum(map{ factorial($_) } 0..$n-1)

       This is sometimes called the left factorial, confusingly also used for
       "subfactorial".  This is OEIS series A003422 <http://oeis.org/A003422>.

   subfactorial
       Given positive integer argument "n", returns the subfactorial of "n".
       This is also called the derangement number, and occasionally the left
       factorial.

       This is OEIS series A000166 <http://oeis.org/A000166>.  This
       corresponds to Mathematica's "Subfactorial[n]" function.

   gcd
       Given a list of integers, returns the greatest common divisor.  This is
       often used to test for coprimality <https://oeis.org/wiki/Coprimality>.

   lcm
       Given a list of integers, returns the least common multiple.

   gcdext
       Given two integers "x" and "y", returns "u,v,d" such that "d =
       gcd(x,y)" and "u*x + v*y = d".  This uses the extended Euclidian
       algorithm to compute the values satisfying Bézout's Identity.

       This corresponds to Pari's "gcdext" function, which was renamed from
       "bezout" in Pari 2.6.  The results will hence match "bezout" in
       Math::Pari.

   chinese
         say chinese( [14,643], [254,419], [87,733] );  # 87041638

       Solves a system of simultaneous congruences using the Chinese Remainder
       Theorem (with extension to non-coprime moduli).  A list of "[a,n]"
       pairs are taken as input, each representing an equation "x ≡ a mod n".
       If no solution exists, "undef" is returned.  If a solution is returned,
       the modulus is equal to the lcm of all the given moduli (see "lcm".  In
       the standard case where all values of "n" are coprime, this is just the
       product.  The "n" values must be positive integers, while the "a"
       values are integers.

   vecsum
       Returns the sum of all arguments, each of which must be an integer.

   vecprod
       Returns the product of all arguments, each of which must be an integer.

   kronecker
       Returns the Kronecker symbol "(a|n)" for two integers.  The possible
       return values with their meanings for odd positive "n" are:

          0   a = 0 mod n
          1   a is a quadratic residue modulo n (a = x^2 mod n for some x)
         -1   a is a quadratic non-residue modulo n

       The Kronecker symbol is an extension of the Jacobi symbol to all
       integer values of "n" from the latter's domain of positive odd values
       of "n".  The Jacobi symbol is itself an extension of the Legendre
       symbol, which is only defined for odd prime values of "n".  This
       corresponds to Pari's "kronecker(a,n)" function and Mathematica's
       "KroneckerSymbol[n,m]" function.

   binomial
       Given integer arguments "n" and "k", returns the binomial coefficient
       "n*(n-1)*...*(n-k+1)/k!", also known as the choose function.  Negative
       arguments use the Kronenburg extensions
       <http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.3689/>.  This corresponds to Mathematica's
       "Binomial[n,k]" function, Pari's "binomial(n,k)" function, and GMP's
       "mpz_bin_ui" function.

       For negative arguments, this matches Mathematica.  Pari does not
       implement the "n < 0, k <= n" extension and instead returns 0 for this
       case.  GMP's API does not allow negative "k" but otherwise matches.
       Math::BigInt does not implement any extensions and the results for "n <
       0, k > 0" are undefined.

   addreal =head2 subreal =head2 mulreal =head2 divreal
       Returns the corresponding basic math operation applied to the two
       inputs.  An optional third argument indicates the number of significant
       digits (default 40) with the result rounded.

   logreal
       Returns the natural logarithm of the input "n".  An optional second
       argument indicates the number of significant digits (default 40) with
       the result rounded.

       For logreal(2) we use Formula 25 from Gourdon and Sebah (2010).  For
       other values we use AGM (Sasaki and Kanada theta method).  Performance
       is 100-1000x faster than Math::BigFloat's GMP backend.  It is 10x
       slower than Pari/GP 2.10 and MPFR.

       Negative inputs are returned as "-log(-n)", which matches bignum.
       Pari/GP and Mathematica return "log(-n) + Pi*i".

   expreal
       Returns "e^n" for the input "n".  An optional second argument indicates
       the number of significant digits (default 40) with the result rounded.

       The implementation computes sinh(n), then "e^x" from that.

   powreal
       Returns "n^x" for the inputs "n" and "x".  An optional third argument
       indicates the number of significant digits (default 40) with the result
       rounded.

       Like logreal and expreal, this is a basic math function that is not
       available from the GMP library but implemented in MPFR.  Since the
       latter is not always available, this can be useful to have.

   rootreal
       Returns the "n"-th root of "x" for the inputs "n" and "x".  An optional
       third argument indicates the number of significant digits (default 40)
       with the result rounded.

       This is just powreal(x^(1/n), but allows "n" to be easily specified in
       full precision.

   agmreal
       Returns the Arithmetic-Geometric mean (AGM) of "a" and "b".  An
       optional third argument indicates the number of significant digits
       (default 40) with the result rounded.

       Examples of use include elementary constants (e.g. "Pi" and "e"), logs,
       exponentials, trigonometric functions, elliptic integrals, computing
       pendulum periods, and more.

       This corresponds to Pari's "agm(x,y)" function, limited to positive
       reals (Pari also handles negative, complex, p-adic, and power series
       arguments).

   bernfrac
       Returns the Bernoulli number "B_n" for an integer argument "n", as a
       rational number.  Two values are returned, the numerator and
       denominator.  B_1 = 1/2.  This corresponds to Pari's bernfrac(n) and
       Mathematica's "BernoulliB" functions.

   bernreal
       Returns the Bernoulli number "B_n" for an integer argument "n", as a
       string floating point.  An optional second argument indicates the
       number of significant digits to be used, with the result rounded.  The
       default is 40 digits.  This corresponds to Pari's "bernreal" function
       and.

   harmfrac
       Returns the Harmonic number "H_n" for an integer argument "n", as a
       rational number.  Two values are returned, the numerator and
       denominator.  numbers are the sum of reciprocals of the first "n"
       natural numbers: "1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n".  This corresponds to
       Mathematica's "HarmonicNumber" function.

   harmreal
       Returns the Harmonic number "H_n" for an integer argument "n", as a
       string floating point.  An optional second argument indicates the
       number of digits to be preserved past the decimal place, with a default
       of 40.

   stirling
         say "s(14,2) = ", stirling(14, 2);
         say "S(14,2) = ", stirling(14, 2, 2);

       Returns the Stirling numbers of either the first kind (default), the
       second kind, or the third kind (the unsigned Lah numbers), with the
       kind selected as an optional third argument.  It takes two non-negative
       integer arguments "n" and "k" plus the optional "type".  This
       corresponds to Pari's "stirling(n,k,{type})" function and Mathematica's
       "StirlingS1" / "StirlingS2" functions.

       Stirling numbers of the first kind are "-1^(n-k)" times the number of
       permutations of "n" symbols with exactly "k" cycles.  Stirling numbers
       of the second kind are the number of ways to partition a set of "n"
       elements into "k" non-empty subsets.  The Lah numbers are the number of
       ways to split a set of "n" elements into "k" non-empty lists.

   zeta
       Given a positive integer or float "n", returns the real Riemann Zeta
       value as a string floating point.  An optional second argument
       indicates the number of digits past the decimal point (default 40).

       The implementation is algorithm 2 of Borwein (1991).  Performance with
       integer inputs is good, but floating point arguments with high
       precision will be slower than methods using MPFR.  Math::Prime::Util
       will try to use Math::MPFR if possible.

   li
       Given a positive integer or float "n", returns the real Logarithmic
       Integral as a string floating point.  An optional second argument
       indicates the number of significant digits (default 40) with the result
       rounded.

       The implementation uses Ramanjan's series.  This corresponds to
       Mathematica's "Li" function.

   ei
       Given a positive integer or float "n", returns the real Exponential
       Integral as a string floating point.  An optional second argument
       indicates the number of significant digits (default 40) with the result
       rounded.

       The implementation is simply li(exp(x)).

   riemannr
       Given a positive integer or float "n", returns the real Riemann R
       function as a string floating point.  An optional second argument
       indicates the number of significant digits (default 40) with the result
       rounded.

       The implementation is the standard Gram series.  This corresponds to
       Mathematica's "RiemannR" function.

   lambertw
       Given a float "x", returns the principal branch of the Lambert W
       function.  This solves for "W" in the equation "x = W*exp(W)".  The
       input must not be less than "-1/e".  This corresponds to Pari's
       "lambertw" function and Mathematica's "ProductLog" / "LambertW"
       function.

   znorder
         $order = znorder(17, "100000000000000000000000065");

       Given two positive integers "a" and "n", returns the multiplicative
       order of "a" modulo "n".  This is the smallest positive integer "k"
       such that "a^k ≡ 1 mod n".  Returns 1 if "a = 1".  Returns undef if "a
       = 0" or if "a" and "n" are not coprime, since no value will result in 1
       mod n.  This corresponds to Pari's "znorder(Mod(a,n))" function and
       Mathematica's "MultiplicativeOrder[a,n]" function.

   znprimroot
       Given a positive integer "n", returns the smallest primitive root of
       "(Z/nZ)^*", or "undef" if no root exists.  A root exists when
       "euler_phi($n) == carmichael_lambda($n)", which will be true for all
       prime "n" and some composites.

       OEIS A033948 <http://oeis.org/A033948> is a sequence of integers where
       the primitive root exists, while OEIS A046145 <http://oeis.org/A046145>
       is a list of the smallest primitive roots, which is what this function
       produces.

   is_primitive_root
       Given two non-negative numbers "a" and "n", returns 1 if "a" is a
       primitive root modulo "n", and 0 if not.  If "a" is a primitive root,
       then euler_phi(n) is the smallest "e" for which "a^e = 1 mod n".

   is_semiprime
       Given a positive integer "n", returns 1 if "n" is a semiprime, 0
       otherwise.  A semiprime is the product of exactly two primes.

       The boolean result is the same as "scalar(factor(n)) == 2", but this
       function performs shortcuts that can greatly speed up the operation.

   is_carmichael
       Given a positive integer "n", returns 1 if "n" is a Carmichael number,
       0 otherwise.  These are composites that satisfy "b^(n-1) ≡ 1 mod n" for
       all "1 < b < n" relatively prime to "n".  Alternately Korselt's theorem
       says these are composites such that "n" is square-free and "p-1"
       divides "n-1" for all prime divisors "p" of "n".

       Inputs greater than 50 digits use a probabilistic test to avoid fully
       factoring the input.

   is_fundamental
       Given a positive integer "n", returns 1 if "n" is a fundamental
       discriminant, 0 otherwise.

   is_totient
       Given an integer "n", returns 1 if there exists an integer "x" where
       "euler_phi(x) == n".

   is_polygonal
       Given integers "x" and "s", return 1 if x is an s-gonal number, 0
       otherwise.  "s" must be greater than 2.

   polygonal_nth
       Given integers "x" and "s", return N if "x" is the "N-th" s-gonal
       number, 0 otherwise.

   sigma
         say "Sum of divisors of $n:", sigma( $n );
         say "sigma_2($n) = ", sigma($n, 2);
         say "Number of divisors: sigma_0($n) = ", sigma($n, 0);

       This function takes a positive integer as input and returns the sum of
       its divisors, including 1 and itself.  An optional second argument "k"
       may be given, which will result in the sum of the "k-th" powers of the
       divisors to be returned.

       This is known as the sigma function (see Hardy and Wright section 16.7,
       or OEIS A000203).  The API is identical to Pari/GP's "sigma" function.
       This function is useful for calculating things like aliquot sums,
       abundant numbers, perfect numbers, etc.

   ramanujan_tau
       Takes a positive integer as input and returns the value of Ramanujan's
       tau function.  The result is a signed integer.  This corresponds to
       Mathematica's "RamanujanTau" function and Pari's "ramanujantau"
       function.

   valuation
         say "$n is divisible by 2 ", valuation($n,2), " times.";

       Given integers "n" and "k", returns the numbers of times "n" is
       divisible by "k".  This is a very limited version of the algebraic
       valuation meaning, just applied to integers.  This corresponds to
       Pari's "valuation" function.  0 is returned if "n" or "k" is one of the
       values -1, 0, or 1.

   hammingweight
       Given an integer "n", returns the binary Hamming weight of abs(n).
       This is also called the population count, and is the number of 1s in
       the binary representation.  This corresponds to Pari's "hammingweight"
       function for "t_INT" arguments.

   moebius
         say "$n is square free" if moebius($n) != 0;
         $sum += moebius($_) for (1..200); say "Mertens(200) = $sum";
         say "Mertens(2000) = ", vecsum(moebius(0,2000));

       Returns μ(n), the Möbius function (also known as the Moebius, Mobius,
       or MoebiusMu function) for an integer input.  This function is 1 if "n
       = 1", 0 if "n" is not square free (i.e. "n" has a repeated factor), and
       "-1^t" if "n" is a product of "t" distinct primes.  This is an
       important function in prime number theory.  Like SAGE, we define
       "moebius(0) = 0" for convenience.

       If called with two arguments, they define a range "low" to "high", and
       the function returns an array with the value of the Möbius function for
       every n from low to high inclusive.

   invmod
         say "The inverse of 42 mod 2017 = ", invmod(42,2017);

       Given two integers "a" and "n", return the inverse of "a" modulo "n".
       If not defined, undef is returned.  If defined, then the return value
       multiplied by "a" equals 1 modulo "n".

   sqrtmod
       Given two integers "a" and "p", return the square root of "a" mod "p".
       If no square root exists, undef is returned.  If defined, the return
       value "s" will always satisfy "mulmod(s,s,p) = a".

       If "p" is not a prime, it is possible no result will be returned even
       though a modular root exists.

       Only one root is returned, even though there are at least two.  In the
       case of "p" a prime and a return value "s", then both "+s mod n" and
       "-s mod n" are roots.  The least "s" will be returned.  In the case of
       composites, many roots may exist, but only one will be returned.

   addmod
       Given three integers "a", "b", and "n" where "a" and "n" are unsigned,
       return "(a+b) mod n".  This is particularly useful when dealing with
       numbers that are larger than a half-word but still native size.  No
       bigint package is needed and this can be 10-200x faster than using one.

   mulmod
       Given three integers "a", "b", and "n" where "a" and "n" are unsigned,
       return "(a*b) mod n".  This is particularly useful when "n" fits in a
       native integer.  No bigint package is needed and this can be 10-200x
       faster than using one.

   powmod
       Given three integers "a", "b", and "n" where "a" and "n" are unsigned,
       return "(a ** b) mod n".  Typically binary exponentiation is used, so
       the process is very efficient.  With native size inputs, no bigint
       library is needed.

   divmod
       Given three integers "a", "b", and "n" where "a" and "n" are unsigned,
       return "(a/b) mod n".  This is done as "(a * (1/b mod n)) mod n".  If
       no inverse of "b" mod "n" exists then undef if returned.

   consecutive_integer_lcm
         $lcm = consecutive_integer_lcm($n);

       Given an unsigned integer argument, returns the least common multiple
       of all integers from 1 to "n".  This can be done by manipulation of the
       primes up to "n", resulting in much faster and memory-friendly results
       than using factorials.

   partitions
       Calculates the partition function p(n) for a non-negative integer
       input.  This is the number of ways of writing the integer n as a sum of
       positive integers, without restrictions.  This corresponds to Pari's
       "numbpart" function and Mathematica's "PartitionsP" function.  The
       values produced in order are OEIS series A000041
       <http://oeis.org/A000041>.

       This uses a combinatorial calculation, which means it will not be very
       fast compared to Pari, Mathematica, or FLINT which use the Rademacher
       formula using multi-precision floating point.  In 10 seconds, the pure
       Perl version can produce partitions(10_000) while with
       Math::Prime::Util::GMP it can do partitions(220_000).  In contrast, in
       about 10 seconds Pari can solve numbpart(22_000_000).

       If you want the enumerated partitions, see "forpart" in
       Math::Prime::Util or Integer::Partition.  These are fast and memory
       efficient iterators, but not practical for producing the partition
       number for values over 100 or so.

   numtoperm
         @p = numtoperm(10,654321);  # @p=(1,8,2,7,6,5,3,4,9,0)

       Given a non-negative integer "n" and integer "k", return the rank "k"
       lexicographic permutation of "n" elements.  "k" will be interpreted as
       mod "n!".

   permtonum
         $k = permtonum([1,8,2,7,6,5,3,4,9,0]);  # $k = 654321

       Given an array reference containing integers from 0 to "n", returns the
       lexicographic permutation rank of the set.  This is the inverse of the
       "numtoperm" function.  All integers up to "n" must be present.  The
       result will be between 0 and "n!-1".

   Pi
       Takes a positive integer argument "n" and returns the constant Pi with
       that many digits (including the leading 3).  Rounding is performed.

       The implementation uses either AGM or Ramanujan/Chudnovsky with binary
       splitting, depending on the number of digits.  It is a little over 2x
       faster than MPFR, similar in speed to Pari/GP, but about 1.5x slower
       than Xue's Chudnovsky demo from the GMP web site.  Specialized programs
       such as "y-cruncher" are even faster.

       Note there is a non-trivial amount of overhead in turning the result
       into a string, as well as even more if using the ntheory module which
       further converts the result into a Math::BigFloat object.

       Called in void context, this just calculates and caches the result.

   Euler
       Takes a positive integer argument "n" and returns Euler's constant with
       that many digits.  Rounding is performed.

       The implementation is Brent-McMillan algorithm B, just like Pari/GP.
       Performance is about 3x faster than Pari/GP, but 2-10x slower than MPFR
       which uses binary splitting.

       Called in void context, this just calculates and caches the result.

   exp_mangoldt
         say "exp(lambda($_)) = ", exp_mangoldt($_) for 1 .. 100;

       Returns EXP(Λ(n)), the exponential of the Mangoldt function (also known
       as von Mangoldt's function) for an integer value.  The Mangoldt
       function is equal to log p if n is prime or a power of a prime, and 0
       otherwise.  We return the exponential so all results are integers.
       Hence the return value for "exp_mangoldt" is:

          p   if n = p^m for some prime p and integer m >= 1
          1   otherwise.

   totient
         say "The Euler totient of $n is ", totient($n);

       Returns φ(n), the Euler totient function (also called Euler's phi or
       phi function) for an integer value.  This is an arithmetic function
       which counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to "n"
       that are relatively prime to "n".  Given the definition used, "totient"
       will return 0 for all "n < 1".  This follows the logic used by SAGE.
       Mathematica and Pari return totient(-n) for "n < 0".  Mathematica
       returns 0 for "n = 0", Pari pre-2.6.2 raises and exception, and Pari
       2.6.2 and newer returns 2.

   jordan_totient
         say "Jordan's totient J_$k($n) is ", jordan_totient($k, $n);

       Returns Jordan's totient function for a given integer value.  Jordan's
       totient is a generalization of Euler's totient, where
         "jordan_totient(1,$n) == euler_totient($n)" This counts the number of
       k-tuples less than or equal to n that form a coprime tuple with n.  As
       with "totient", 0 is returned for all "n < 1".  This function can be
       used to generate some other useful functions, such as the Dedekind psi
       function, where "psi(n) = J(2,n) / J(1,n)".

   carmichael_lambda
       Returns the Carmichael function (also called the reduced totient
       function, or Carmichael λ(n)) of a positive integer argument.  It is
       the smallest positive integer "m" such that "a^m = 1 mod n" for every
       integer "a" coprime to "n".  This is OEIS series A002322
       <http://oeis.org/A002322>.

   liouville
       Returns λ(n), the Liouville function for a non-negative integer input.
       This is -1 raised to Ω(n) (the total number of prime factors).

   is_power
         say "$n is a perfect square" if is_power($n, 2);
         say "$n is a perfect cube" if is_power($n, 3);
         say "$n is a ", is_power($n), "-th power";

       Given a single positive integer input "n", returns k if "n = p^k" for
       some integer "p > 1, k > 1", and 0 otherwise.  The k returned is the
       largest possible.  This can be used in a boolean statement to determine
       if "n" is a perfect power.

       If given two arguments "n" and "k", returns 1 if "n" is a "k-th" power,
       and 0 otherwise.  For example, if "k=2" then this detects perfect
       squares.

       This corresponds to Pari/GP's "ispower" function, with the limitations
       of only integer arguments and no third argument may be given to return
       the root.

   is_square
       Given a positive integer "n", returns 1 if "n" is a perfect square, 0
       otherwise.  This is identical to "is_power(n,2)".

       This corresponds to Pari/GP's "issquare" function.

   is_prime_power
       Given an integer input "n", returns "k" if "n = p^k" for some prime p,
       and zero otherwise.

       This corresponds to Pari/GP's "isprimepower" function.

   sqrtint
       Returns the truncated integer part of the square root of "n".

       This corresponds to Pari/GP's "sqrtint" function.

   rootint
       Given "n" and "k", returns the truncated integer part of the "k-th"
       root of "n".

       This corresponds to Pari/GP's "sqrtnint" function.

   logint
       Given "n" and "b", returns the integer base-"b" logarithm of "n".  This
       is the largest integer "e" such that "b^e <= n".

       This corresponds to Pari/GP's "logint" function.

   powint
       Given integers "a" and "b", returns "a^b".  For <0^0> we return 1.

       The exponent "b" is converted into an unsigned long.

   mulint
       Given integers "a" and "b", returns "a * b".

   addint
       Given integers "a" and "b", returns "a + b".

   subint
       Given integers "a" and "b", returns "a - b".

   divint
       Given integers "a" and "b", returns the quotient "a / b".

       Floor division is used, so q is rounded towards -inf and the remainder
       has the same sign as the divisor "b".  This is the same as modern
       "bdiv" in Math::BigInt and the GMP "fdiv" functions, but not the same
       as Pari/GP's "\\" operator.

   modint
       Given integers "a" and "b", returns the modulo "a % b".

           C<r = a - b * floor(a / b)>

       Floor division is used, so q is rounded towards -inf and r has the same
       sign as the divisor "b"..  This is the same as modern "bmod" in
       Math::BigInt and the GMP "fdiv" functions, but not the same as
       Pari/GP's "%" operator.

   divrem
           my($quo, $rem) = divrem($a, $b);

       Given integers "a" and "b", returns a list of two items: the Euclidean
       quotient and the Euclidean remainder.

       This corresponds to Pari/GP's "divrem" function.  There is no explicit
       function in Math::BigInt that gives this division method for signed
       inputs.

   tdivrem
       Given integers "a" and "b", returns a list of two items: the truncated
       quotient and the truncated remainder.

       The resulting pair will match "btdiv" in Math::BigInt and "btmod" in
       Math::BigInt.

   absint
       Given integer "n", return "|n|", i.e. the absolute value of "n".

   negint
       Given integer "n", return "-n".

   factor
         @factors = factor(640552686568398413516426919223357728279912327120302109778516984973296910867431808451611740398561987580967216226094312377767778241368426651540749005659);
         # Returns an array of 11 factors

       Returns a list of prime factors of a positive number, in numerical
       order.  The special cases of "n = 0" and "n = 1" will return "n".

       Like most advanced factoring programs, a mix of methods is used.  This
       includes trial division for small factors, perfect power detection,
       Pollard's Rho, Pollard's P-1 with various smoothness and stage
       settings, Hart's OLF (a Fermat variant), ECM (elliptic curve method),
       and QS (quadratic sieve).  Certainly improvements could be designed for
       this algorithm (suggestions are welcome).

       In practice, this factors 26-digit semiprimes in under "100ms",
       36-digit semiprimes in under one second.  Arbitrary integers are
       factored faster.  It is many orders of magnitude faster than any other
       factoring module on CPAN circa 2013.  It is comparable in speed to
       Math::Pari's "factorint" for most inputs.

       If you want better factoring in general, I recommend looking at the
       standalone programs yafu <http://sourceforge.net/projects/yafu/>,
       msieve <http://sourceforge.net/projects/msieve/>, gmp-ecm
       <http://ecm.gforge.inria.fr/>, and GGNFS
       <http://sourceforge.net/projects/ggnfs/>.

   divisors
         my @divisors = divisors(30);   # returns (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30)

       Produces all the divisors of a positive number input, including 1 and
       the input number.  The divisors are a power set of multiplications of
       the prime factors, returned as a sorted list with no duplications.  The
       result is identical to that of Pari's "divisors" and Mathematica's
       "Divisors[n]" functions.

       In scalar context this returns the sigma0 function (OEIS A000005), and
       is the same result as evaluating the returned array in scalar context
       (but much more efficient).  The result then corresponds to Pari's
       "numdiv" and Mathematica's "DivisorSigma[0,n]" functions.

   trial_factor
         my @factors = trial_factor($n);
         my @factors = trial_factor($n, 1000);

       Given a positive number input, tries to discover a factor using trial
       division.  The resulting array will contain either two factors (it
       succeeded) or the original number (no factor was found).  In either
       case, multiplying @factors yields the original input.  An optional
       divisor limit may be given as the second parameter.  Factoring will
       stop when the input is a prime, one factor is found, or the input has
       been tested for divisibility with all primes less than or equal to the
       limit.  If no limit is given, then "2**31-1" will be used.

       This is a good and fast initial test, and will be very fast for small
       numbers (e.g. under 1 million).  For larger numbers, faster methods for
       complete factoring have been known since the 17th century.

       For inputs larger than about 1000 digits, a dynamic product/remainder
       tree is used, which is faster than GMP's native methods.  This helps
       when pruning composites or looking for very small factors.

   prho_factor
         my @factors = prho_factor($n);
         my @factors = prho_factor($n, 100_000_000);

       Given a positive number input, tries to discover a factor using
       Pollard's Rho method.  The resulting array will contain either two
       factors (it succeeded) or the original number (no factor was found).
       In either case, multiplying @factors yields the original input.  An
       optional number of rounds may be given as the second parameter.
       Factoring will stop when the input is a prime, one factor has been
       found, or the number of rounds has been exceeded.

       This is the Pollard Rho method with "f = x^2 + 3" and default rounds
       64M.  It is very good at finding small factors.  Typically
       "pbrent_factor" will be preferred as it behaves similarly but runs
       quite a bit faster.  They use different parameters however, so are not
       completely identical.

   pbrent_factor
         my @factors = pbrent_factor($n);
         my @factors = pbrent_factor($n, 100_000_000);

       Given a positive number input, tries to discover a factor using
       Pollard's Rho method with Brent's algorithm.  The resulting array will
       contain either two factors (it succeeded) or the original number (no
       factor was found).  In either case, multiplying @factors yields the
       original input.  An optional number of rounds may be given as the
       second parameter.  Factoring will stop when the input is a prime, one
       factor has been found, or the number of rounds has been exceeded.

       This is the Pollard Rho method using Brent's modified cycle detection,
       delayed "gcd" computations, and backtracking.  It is essentially
       Algorithm P''2 from Brent (1980).  Parameters used are "f = x^2 + 3"
       and default rounds 64M.  It is very good at finding small factors.

   pminus1_factor
         my @factors = pminus1_factor($n);

         # Set B1 smoothness to 10M, second stage automatically set.
         my @factors = pminus1_factor($n, 10_000_000);

         # Run p-1 with B1 = 10M, B2 = 100M.
         my @factors = pminus1_factor($n, 10_000_000, 100_000_000);

       Given a positive number input, tries to discover a factor using
       Pollard's "p-1" method.  The resulting array will contain either two
       factors (it succeeded) or the original number (no factor was found).
       In either case, multiplying @factors yields the original input.  An
       optional first stage smoothness factor (B1) may be given as the second
       parameter.  This will be the smoothness limit B1 for the first stage,
       and will use "10*B1" for the second stage limit B2.  If a third
       parameter is given, it will be used as the second stage limit B2.
       Factoring will stop when the input is a prime, one factor has been
       found, or the algorithm fails to find a factor with the given
       smoothness.

       This is Pollard's "p-1" method using a default smoothness of 5M and a
       second stage of "B2 = 10 * B1".  It can quickly find a factor "p" of
       the input "n" if the number "p-1" factors into small primes.  For
       example "n = 22095311209999409685885162322219" has the factor "p =
       3916587618943361", where "p-1 = 2^7 * 5 * 47 * 59 * 3137 * 703499", so
       this method will find a factor in the first stage if "B1 >= 703499" or
       in the second stage if "B1 >= 3137" and "B2 >= 703499".

       The implementation is written from scratch using the basic algorithm
       including a second stage as described in Montgomery 1987.  It is faster
       than most simple implementations I have seen (many of which are written
       assuming native precision inputs), but slower than Ben Buhrow's code
       used in earlier versions of yafu
       <http://sourceforge.net/projects/yafu/>, and nowhere close to the speed
       of the version included with modern GMP-ECM with large B values (it is
       actually quite a bit faster than GMP-ECM with small smoothness values).

   pplus1_factor
         my @factors = pplus1_factor($n);

       Given a positive number input, tries to discover a factor using
       Williams' "p+1" method.  The resulting array will contain either two
       factors (it succeeded) or the original number (no factor was found).
       In either case, multiplying @factors yields the original input.  An
       optional first stage smoothness factor (B1) may be given as the second
       parameter.  This will be the smoothness limit B1 for the first stage.
       Factoring will stop when the input is a prime, one factor has been
       found, or the algorithm fails to find a factor with the given
       smoothness.

   holf_factor
         my @factors = holf_factor($n);
         my @factors = holf_factor($n, 100_000_000);

       Given a positive number input, tries to discover a factor using Hart's
       OLF method.  The resulting array will contain either two factors (it
       succeeded) or the original number (no factor was found).  In either
       case, multiplying @factors yields the original input.  An optional
       number of rounds may be given as the second parameter.  Factoring will
       stop when the input is a prime, one factor has been found, or the
       number of rounds has been exceeded.

       This is Hart's One Line Factorization method, which is a variant of
       Fermat's algorithm.  A premultiplier of 480 is used.  It is very good
       at factoring numbers that are close to perfect squares, or small
       numbers.  Very naive methods of picking RSA parameters sometimes yield
       numbers in this form, so it can be useful to run a few rounds to check.
       For example, the number:

         18548676741817250104151622545580576823736636896432849057 \
         10984160646722888555430591384041316374473729421512365598 \
         29709849969346650897776687202384767704706338162219624578 \
         777915220190863619885201763980069247978050169295918863

       was proposed by someone as an RSA key.  It is indeed composed of two
       distinct prime numbers of similar bit length.  Most factoring methods
       will take a very long time to break this.  However one factor is almost
       exactly 5x larger than the other, allowing HOLF to factor this
       222-digit semiprime in only a few milliseconds.

   squfof_factor
         my @factors = squfof_factor($n);
         my @factors = squfof_factor($n, 100_000_000);

       Given a positive number input, tries to discover a factor using Shanks'
       square forms factorization method (usually known as SQUFOF).  The
       resulting array will contain either two factors (it succeeded) or the
       original number (no factor was found).  In either case, multiplying
       @factors yields the original input.  An optional number of rounds may
       be given as the second parameter.  Factoring will stop when the input
       is a prime, one factor has been found, or the number of rounds has been
       exceeded.

       This is Daniel Shanks' SQUFOF (square forms factorization) algorithm.
       The particular implementation is a non-racing multiple-multiplier
       version, based on code ideas of Ben Buhrow and Jason Papadopoulos as
       well as many others.  SQUFOF is often the preferred method for small
       numbers, and Math::Prime::Util as well as many other packages use it
       was the default method for native size (e.g. 32-bit or 64-bit) numbers
       after trial division.  The GMP version used in this module will work
       for larger values, but my testing indicates it is generally slower than
       the "prho" and "pbrent" implementations.

   ecm_factor
         my @factors = ecm_factor($n);
         my @factors = ecm_factor($n, 12500);      # B1 = 12500
         my @factors = ecm_factor($n, 12500, 10);  # B1 = 12500, curves = 10

       Given a positive number input, tries to discover a factor using ECM.
       The resulting array will contain either two factors (it succeeded) or
       the original number (no factor was found).  In either case, multiplying
       @factors yields the original input.  An optional maximum smoothness may
       be given as the second parameter, which relates to the size of factor
       to search for.  An optional third parameter indicates the number of
       random curves to use at each smoothness value being searched.

       This is an implementation of Hendrik Lenstra's elliptic curve factoring
       method, usually referred to as ECM.  The implementation is reasonable,
       using projective coordinates, Montgomery's PRAC heuristic for EC
       multiplication, and two stages.  It is much slower than the latest GMP-
       ECM, but still quite useful for factoring reasonably sized inputs.

   qs_factor
         my @factors = qs_factor($n);

       Given a positive number input, tries to discover factors using QS (the
       quadratic sieve).  The resulting array will contain one or more numbers
       such that multiplying @factors yields the original input.  Typically
       multiple factors will be produced, unlike the other "..._factor"
       routines.

       The current implementation is a modified version of SIMPQS, a
       predecessor to the QS in FLINT, and was written by William Hart in
       2006.  It will not operate on input less than 30 digits.  The memory
       use for large inputs is more than desired, so other methods such as
       "pbrent_factor", "pminus1_factor", and "ecm_factor" are recommended to
       begin with to filter out small factors.  However, it is substantially
       faster than the other methods on large inputs having large factors, and
       is the method of choice for 35+ digit semiprimes.

   todigits
       Given an integer "n", return an array of digits of "|n|".  An optional
       second integer argument specifies a base (default 10).  For example,
       given a base of 2, this returns an array of binary digits of "n".  An
       optional third argument specifies a length for the returned array.  The
       result will be either have upper digits truncated or have leading zeros
       added.

       todigits(0) returns an empty array.  The base must be at least 2, and
       is limited to an int.  Length must be at least zero and is limited to
       an int.

   seed_csprng
       Takes a non-negative integer "nbytes" and a string "data" as input.
       These are used to seed the internal CSPRNG used for random functions,
       including the random prime functions.  Ideally this is 16-256 bytes of
       good entropy.

       Currently the CSPRNG is ISAAC-32, and the maximum number of seed bytes
       used is 1024.  The CSPRNG will likely change to ChaCha20 in a later
       release.

   is_csprng_well_seeded
       Returns true if the CSPRNG has been seeded with 16 or more bytes (128
       bits).  There is no measurement of how "good" the input was.

       On startup the module will attempt to seed the CSPRNG from
       "/dev/urandom", so this function will return true if that was
       successful, but false otherwise.

   urandomb
         $n32 = urandomb(32);    # Classic irand32, returns a UV
         $n   = urandomb(1024);  # Random integer less than 2^1024

       Given a number of bits "b", returns a random unsigned integer less than
       "2^b".  The result will be uniformly distributed between 0 and "2^b-1"
       inclusive.

       This is similar to the GMP function "mpz_urandomb".

   urandomm
         $n = urandomm(100);    # random integer in [0,99]
         $n = urandomm(1024);   # random integer in [0,1023]

       Given a positive integer "n", returns a random unsigned integer less
       than "n".  The results will be uniformly distributed between 0 and
       "n-1" inclusive.

       This is similar to the GMP function "mpz_urandomm".

   urandomr
         $n  = urandomr(100, 110);        # Random number [100,110]
         $nb = urandomr(2**24,2**25-1);   # Random 25-bit number
         $nd = urandomr(10**24,10**25-1); # Random 25-digit number

       Given values "low" and "high", returns a uniform random unsigned
       integer in the range "[low,high]".  Both inputs must be non-negative.
       If "low > high" then function will return "undef".  Note that the range
       is inclusive, so "low", "high", and each integer between them have an
       equal probability of appearing.

   irand
         $n32 = irand;     # random 32-bit integer

       Returns a random 32-bit integer using the CSPRNG.

       Performance is similar to "rand" in Math::Random::MTwist and
       Math::Random::Xorshift.  It is somewhat faster than casting system
       "rand" to a 32-bit int.  It is noticeably faster than
       Math::Random::ISAAC, Math::Random::ISAAC::XS, Math::Random::MT,
       Math::Random::MT::Auto, and Crypt::PRNG.

   irand64
         $n64 = irand64;   # random 64-bit integer

       Returns a random 64-bit integer using the CSPRNG (on 64-bit Perl).

   drand
         $f = drand;       # random floating point value in [0,1)
         $r = drand(25);   # random floating point value in [0,25)

       Returns a random NV (Perl's native floating point) using the CSPRNG.

       The number of bits returned is equal to the mantissa bits of the NV
       type used for the Perl build, with a max of 64.  By default Perl uses
       doubles and the returned values have 53 bits.  If Perl is built with
       long double support and the long doubles have a larger mantissa, then
       more bits are used.

       This gives substantially better quality random numbers than the default
       Perl "rand" function.  Among other things, on modern Perl's, "rand"
       uses drand48, which gives 32 bits of decent random values and 16 more
       bits of known patterns (e.g. the 48th bit alternates, the 47th has a
       period of 4, etc.).  There are much better choices for standard random
       number generators, such as the Mersenne Twister from
       Math::Random::MTwist.

       Performance is similar to "rand" in Math::Random::MTwist and
       Math::Random::Xorshift.  It is 1.5 - 2x slower than core "rand" (as are
       the other modules).

   random_bytes
         $str = random_bytes(32);     # 32 random bytes

       Given an unsigned number "n" of bytes, returns a binary string filled
       with random data from the CSPRNG.  Performance for getting 256 byte
       strings:

           -------------             ---------   ----------------------
           Data::Entropy::Algorithms    2027/s   CSPRNG - AES Counter
           Crypt::Random                6649/s   CSPRNG - /dev/urandom

           rand+pack                   82977/s   drand48
           Crypt::PRNG                298567/s   CSPRNG - Fortuna
           Bytes::Random::XS          383354/s   drand48
           ntheory                    770364/s   CSPRNG - ChaCha20
           Math::Random::MTwist      1890151/s   Mersenne Twister
           Math::Prime::Util::GMP    2045715/s   CSPRNG - ISAAC

       Each of the CSPRNG modules should be high quality.  There are no known
       flaws in any of ISAAC, AES CTR, ChaCha20, or Fortuna.  The industry
       seems to be standardizing on ChaCha20 (e.g. BSD, Linux, TLS).

SEE ALSO
       Math::Prime::Util Has many more functions, lots of fast code for
       dealing with native-precision arguments (including much faster primes
       using sieves), and will use this module when needed for big numbers.
       Using Math::Prime::Util rather than this module directly is
       recommended.
       Math::Primality (version 0.08) A Perl module with support for the
       strong Miller-Rabin test, strong Lucas-Selfridge test, the BPSW
       probable prime test, next_prime / prev_prime, the AKS primality test,
       and prime_count.  It uses Math::GMPz to do all the calculations, so is
       faster than pure Perl bignums, but a lot slower than XS+GMP.  The
       prime_count function is only usable for very small inputs, but the
       other functions are quite good for big numbers.  Make sure to use
       version 0.05 or newer.
       Math::Pari Supports quite a bit of the same functionality (and much
       more).  See "SEE ALSO" in Math::Prime::Util for more detailed
       information on how the modules compare.

       Jason Papadopoulos wrote the tinyqs code which is basically unchanged.
       William Hart wrote SIMPQS which is the basis for the QS code.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
       Obviously none of this would be possible without the mathematicians who
       created and published their work.  Eratosthenes, Gauss, Euler, Riemann,
       Fermat, Lucas, Baillie, Pollard, Brent, Montgomery, Shanks, Hart,
       Wagstaff, Dixon, Pomerance, A.K. Lenstra, H. W. Lenstra Jr., Atkin,
       Knuth, etc.

       The GNU GMP team, whose product allows me to concentrate on coding
       high-level algorithms and not worry about any of the details of how
       modular exponentiation and the like happen, and still get decent
       performance for my purposes.

       Ben Buhrow and Jason Papadopoulos deserve special mention for their
       open source factoring tools, which are both readable and fast.  In
       particular I am leveraging their work on SQUFOF in the current
       implementation.  They are a huge resource to the community.

       Jonathan Leto and Bob Kuo, who wrote and distributed the
       Math::Primality module on CPAN.  Their implementation of BPSW provided
       the motivation I needed to do it in this module and Math::Prime::Util.
       I also used their module quite a bit for testing against.

       Paul Zimmermann's papers and GMP-ECM code were of great value for my
       projective ECM implementation, as well as the many papers by Brent and
       Montgomery.
