DateTime::Calendar::Pataphysical(3)        User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       DateTime::Calendar::Pataphysical - Dates in the Pataphysical calendar

VERSION
       version 0.07

SYNOPSIS
         use DateTime::Calendar::Pataphysical;

         $dt = DateTime::Calendar::Pataphysical->new( year  => 1752,
                                                      month => 10,
                                                      day   => 4 );

DESCRIPTION
       DateTime::Calendar::Pataphysical is the implementation of the
       Pataphysical calendar. Each year in this calendar contains 13 months of
       29 days. This regularity makes this a convenient alternative for the
       irregular Gregorian calendar.

       This module is designed to be easy to use in combination with DateTime.
       Most of its methods correspond to a DateTime method of the same name.

CLASS METHODS
   new
           my $dt = DateTime::Calendar::Pataphysical-new(
               year  => $year_in_the_pataphysical_era,
               month => $pataphysical_month_number,
               day   => $pataphysical_day_number,
           );

       This class method accepts parameters for each date and time component:
       "year", "month", "day".  Additionally, it accepts a "locale" parameter.

       The "rd_secs" parameter is also accepted. This parameter is only useful
       in conversions to other calendars; this calendar does not use its
       value.

   from_epoch
           my $dt = DateTime::Calendar::Pataphysical->from_epoch( epoch => $epoch, ... );

       This class method can be used to construct a new object from an epoch
       time instead of components. Just as with the new constructor, it
       accepts a "locale" parameter.

   now
           my $dt = DateTime::Calendar::Pataphysical->now;

       This class method is equivalent to calling from_epoch() with the value
       returned from Perl's time function.

   from_object
           my $dt = DateTime::Calendar::Pataphysical->from_object( object => $object, ... );

       This class method can be used to construct a new object from any object
       that implements the utc_rd_values method.  All DateTime::Calendar
       modules must implement this method in order to provide cross-calendar
       compatibility.  This method accepts a "locale" parameter.

       The time part of $object is stored, and will only be used if the
       created object is converted to another calendar. Only the date part of
       $object is used to calculate the pataphysical date. This calculation is
       based on the local time and date of $object.

   last_day_of_month
           my $dt = DateTime::Calendar::Pataphysical->last_day_of_month( ... );

       This constructor takes the same arguments as can be given to the now
       method, except for "day".  Additionally, both "year" and "month" are
       required.

METHODS
   clone
           my $clone = $dt->clone;

       This object method returns a replica of the given object.

   year
       Returns the year.

   month
       Returns the month of the year, from "1 .. 13".

   month_name
       Returns the name of the current month.

   day_of_month
   day
   mday
       Returns the day of the month, from "1 .. 29".

   day_of_week
   wday
   dow
       Returns the day of the week as a number, from "1 .. 7", with 1 being
       Sunday and 7 being Saturday. Returns "undef" if the day is a "hunyadi".

   day_name
       Returns the name of the current day of the week.

   day_of_year
   doy
       Returns the day of the year.

   ymd
   mdy
   dmy
            my $string = $dt->ymd( $optional_separator );

       Each method returns the year, month, and day, in the order indicated by
       the method name.  Years are zero-padded to three digits.  Months and
       days are 0-padded to two digits.

       By default, the values are separated by a dash ("-"), but this can be
       overridden by passing a value to the method.

   date
       Alias for ymd.

   datetime
       Equivalent to

           $dt->ymd('-') . 'EP'

   is_leap_year
       This method returns a true or false indicating whether or not the
       DateTime object is in a leap year.

   week
           my ( $week_year, $week_number ) = $dt->week;

       Returns information about the calendar week which contains this
       DateTime object. The values returned by this method are also available
       separately through the week_year and week_number methods.

   week_year
       Returns the year of the week. In the Pataphysical calendar, this is
       equal to the year of the date, as all weeks fall in one year only.

   week_number
       Returns the week of the year, from "1 .. 53".

       The 29th of each month falls outside of any week; "week_number" returns
       "undef" for these dates.

   utc_rd_values
       Returns the current UTC Rata Die days and seconds as a two element
       list.  This exists primarily to allow other calendar modules to create
       objects based on the values provided by this object.

   utc_rd_as_seconds
       Returns the current UTC Rata Die days and seconds purely as seconds.
       This is useful when you need a single number to represent a date.

   strftime
           my $string = $dt->strftime( $format, ... );

       This method implements functionality similar to the strftime() method
       in C.  However, if given multiple format strings, then it will return
       multiple elements, one for each format string.

       See DateTime for a list of all possible format specifiers. This module
       implements all specifiers related to dates. There is one additional
       specifier: "%*" represents the feast of that date.

   feast
       Returns the feast or vacuation of the given date.

   type_of_feast
       Returns the type of feast or vacuation.

         '*' means Fête Suprème Première première
         '1' means Fête Suprème Première seconde
         '2' means Fête Suprème Seconde
         '3' means Fête Suprème Tierce
         '4' means Fête Suprème Quarte
         'v' means Vacuation

   is_imaginary
       Returns true or false indicating whether the DateTime object represents
       an imaginary date.

   set
       This method can be used to change the local components of a date time,
       or its locale.  This method accepts any parameter allowed by new.

   truncate
           $dt->truncate( to => ... );

       This method allows you to reset some of the local time components in
       the object to their "zero" values.  The "to" parameter is used to
       specify which values to truncate, and it may be one of "year", "month",
       or "day".

   add_duration
           $dt->add_duration( $duration_object );

       This method adds a "DateTime::Duration" to the current DateTime.  See
       the DateTime::Duration documentation for more details.

   add
           $dt->add( %arguments );

       This method is syntactic sugar around the add_duration method.  It
       simply creates a new DateTime::Duration object using the parameters
       given, and then calls the add_duration method.

   subtract_duration
           $dt->subtract_duration( $duration_object );

       When given a DateTime::Duration object, this method simply calls
       "invert" on that object and passes that new duration to the
       add_duration method.

   subtract
           $dt->subtract( %arguments );

       Like add, this is syntactic sugar for the subtract_duration method.

   subtract_datetime
           $dt->subtract_datetime( $datetime );

       This method returns a new DateTime::Duration object representing the
       difference between the two dates.

   compare
           $cmp = DateTime->compare( $dt1, $dt2 );

           @dates = sort { DateTime->compare( $a, $b ) } @dates;

       Compare two DateTime objects.  The semantics are compatible with Perl's
       sort function; it returns -1 if "$a < $b", 0 if "$a == $b", and 1 if
       "$a > $b".

       Of course, since DateTime objects overload comparison operators, you
       can just do this anyway:

           @dates = sort @dates;

BUGS
       •   Adding a week to a date is exactly equivalent to adding seven days
           in this module because of the way DateTime::Duration is
           implemented.  The Hunyadis are not taken into account.

       •   from_epoch and now probably only work on Unix.
