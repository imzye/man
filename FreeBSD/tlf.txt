NAME
       Tlf - amateur radio contest keyer/logging program for Radiosport

SYNOPSIS
       tlf [-dhnrvV] [-f config_file] [-s user:password@host/dir/logfilename]

DESCRIPTION
       Tlf is a console (ncurses) mode general purpose CW keyer, logging and
       contest program for amateur radio operators. It supports the CQWW, WPX,
       ARRL-DX, ARRL-FD, STEWPERRY, PACC and EU SPRINT contests as well as a
       lot more basic contests, general QSO and DXpedition mode.  From version
       1.2.0 onward there is also support for the FOC Marathon.  It interfaces
       with a Morse Code generator, a number of radios via the Hamlib library,
       and with a DX Cluster via telnet or packet radio.  Tlf can project DX
       cluster data into the excellent Xplanet program, written by Hari Nair.

       Contest operation mimics the popular TR-Log program for DOS, the output
       file is TR-Log compatible.  The log can be exported in ADIF or Cabrillo
       format.

       The program was written for console mode on purpose, which allows it to
       run on smaller machines, or remotely via SSH or a modem link.

       Since Tlf version 0.9.21 the cwdaemon 0.9 is fully supported, featuring
       direct mode for the keyboard and output to parallel and serial ports
       and speed and weight control from the keyboard, and band info output on
       the parallel port.

       For users of the K1EL series of “Win Keyers”, the winkeydaemon is
       available from GitHub <https://github.com/N0NB/winkeydaemon>.  Setup is
       the same as for the cwdaemon.

       For radio control Tlf works with Hamlib (version >= 1.2.8), you can
       find it at www.hamlib.org <https://www.hamlib.org/>.

       Tlf provides full TCP/IP networking between Tlf nodes,
       syncing/distributing log, packet data, frequency data, local talk,
       serial numbers, time sync etc.

OPTIONS
       Options given to Tlf on the command line.

       -?     Show summary of options and exit.

       -f config_file
              Start with non-default configuration file:

              tlf -f PA0R

              Defaults to logcfg.dat in actual working directory.

       -s user:password@host/dir/logfilename
              Synchronize log with other node

              tlf -s user:password@host/dir/logfilename

       -V     Output version information and exit.

       -v     Verbose startup.

       -d     Debug rigctl.

       -n     Start without packet/cluster.

       -r     Start without radio control when user wants to start Tlf without
              modifying logcfg.dat.

       -i     Import an existing CABRILLO file. When Tlf starts, looks for the
              YOURCALL.cab log, reads the configuration and rule files, and
              based on the current setup, generates the log(s). If the contest
              is WAE, and you have QTC's in cabrillo, then Tlf makes the QTC
              logfiles too. Tlf doesn't write over the existing log(s).  The
              generated import will be IMPORT_CONTEST.log, where the CONTEST
              is the name of contest in the config. If QTC exists, then the
              files IMPORT_QTC_sent.log and IMPORT_QTC_recv.log will be
              created.

USAGE
       Tlf has been written for console mode.  If you want to run Tlf from a
       terminal in X, you will probably get the best results if you set
       TERM=linux and use a Linux console terminal.  Both KDE and GNOME
       terminals have a facility to start a Linux console in an X terminal as
       does Xfce-terminal.

       By default, xterm(1) may give unreadable colours.  If so, you will have
       to set different colours in logcfg.dat or prepare $HOME/.Xresources to
       the preferred colour scheme.  One advantage of xterm is that it doesn't
       consume the F11 key which other terminal emulators reserve for full
       screen mode nor Ctrl-PgUp/Ctrl-PgDn which may be used for tab switching
       in other emulators.

       Recent efforts have resulted in improved keyboard handling.  If you
       find keys that do not work, the developers would like to receive your
       report of which keys and which terminal have the problem.  Please send
       the report to the mailing list shown in the BUGS section below.

       There are excellent results with the latest KDE, GNOME, and Xfce
       terminal emulators (vi colours are preferred by some).  As Tlf uses
       ncurses to format its display you must use a proper font.  (Good
       choices are the Linux font, Inconsolata, Hack, or any monospace font
       that dots or slashes the zero character).  If you have problems, try
       the linux text console first and work from there.

       Normally you start or restart Tlf in fast mode with “tlf”.  During
       debugging of a logcfg.dat file you can start in verbose mode, to have a
       look at the startup messages.  From Tlf version 0.9.3 you can load
       different config files with:

              tlf -f config_file

       If you have the packet cluster enabled you will first see the packet
       screen (if you are using telnet and you have provided your callsign in
       logcfg.dat you will be automatically logged in switched to the main
       logging screen).  Log in with your callsign, if needed, and switch to
       the main logging screen with the ‘:’ command.  You can come back to the
       packet screen later with the :PACket command from the call input field
       of the main logging screen.

       You can exit and close Tlf with the :EXIt or :QUIt commands or with
       Ctrl-C, Alt-Q or Alt-X.

       At restart Tlf recalculates the score, which may take some time
       depending on the number of QSOs in the logfile and the speed of your
       system.  Tlf takes the points as they are in the log, and calculates
       the multiplier from either callsign or exchange field (depending on the
       contest).

COMMANDS
       These commands are entered in the callsign field of the main logging
       screen.  Each command consists of the leading ‘:’ and at minimum the
       upper case characters of the command name plus any needed parameters
       separated by ‘Space’.

       :ADIf  Writes the log to an Amateur Data Interchange Format (ADIF) file
              logfile.adif.

       :CHAr  Input the number of characters for CW auto-start or ‘m’ for
              manual start. Possible values are: ‘0’ (off), ‘2’...‘5’ or ‘m’
              (manual).  After typing as many characters in the input field or
              after pressing the ‘Enter’ key in manual mode Tlf starts sending
              the callsign without further keystrokes.  You can type in the
              rest of the call (but quickly).  As soon as the sending catches
              your last typed character Tlf automatically sends the exchange
              and the cursor jumps to the exchange field.  ‘Escape’ stops
              sending.  This works only in CW contests in RUN mode.

       :CHEck
       :NOCheck
              Turn the dupe check window On|Off.

              Toggle the RIT reset after QSO On|Off.

       :SET
       :CFG   Edit various parameters in logcfg.dat file and reload it.

       :SCAn  Enter the SCAN function (return with ‘Escape’).

       :SCOre Toggle the score window On|Off.

       :SCVolume
              Adjust the soundcard volume for the sidetone (Up|Down).  Range:
              0–99.

       :SIMulator
              Toggle simulator mode.  In simulator mode you can work a
              complete CQWW CW contest in TR-Log mode.  Set CONTEST=cqww.

       :SOUnd The SOUND recorder is a utility to record the voice keyer
              messages and enables you to record the complete contest in
              chunks of 1 hour to the hard drive.  It does this in the
              directory: $HOME/tlf/soundlogs.  The sound recorder uses a
              script called soundlog which has to be located in
              $HOME/tlf/soundlogs.  It can be found in the scripts directory.
              If your soundcard is different from /dev/dsp you can use the
              SC_DEVICE parameter in the logcfg.dat file.  The file extension
              is .au, the Sun ulaw format.  The recorder produces < 60 MB per
              hour.  This means you can record a complete CQWW in less than 3
              Giga Bytes. If your disk cannot handle this, FTP the soundfile
              to a server every hour.

              F1 ... F12, s, c, ...  will record the voice keyer message for
              that key.

              1: Start contest recording to ddhhmm.au.

              2: Stop contest recording.

              3: List contest recordings.

              4: Play back contest recording ddhh[mm][:xx].

                     xx is the offset from the start of the file e.g.:

                     2110 will start from beginning of the day 21 hr 10:00
                     file.

                     21100013:00 will start from day 21, hh 10, mm 00, + 13
                     minutes: 0 seconds.

              To create a new file every hour add a crontab(1) job to run the
              following command every hour:

                     /usr/bin/pkill -f sox > /dev/null 2> /dev/null

                     Running the crontab job at other intervals will create
                     sound recordings of the interval period in length.

              Once started the recorder will run until the lock file
              $HOME/.VRlock is removed.

       :SYNc  Synchronize the logfile of this node with the logfile pointed to
              by the parameter SYNCFILE=user:password@host/dir/logfile.  Tlf
              will wget(1) the logfile from the relevant node, make a dated
              backup of your local logfile, and merge the 2 files.  The score
              will be recalculated.

       :TONe [dd]d
              Set PC sidetone frequency in Hertz.  Range: 300–900, 0 = Off.

       :TRXcontrol
              Toggle rig control On|Off.  Default is Off unless RADIO_CONTROL
              is given in logcfg.dat (only makes sense with rig control
              capability).

       :VIEw  View the log with less(1).

       :WRIte Write cabrillo file according to specified format (see CABRILLO
              statement in the RULES section).

KEYS
       Work has been ongoing to unify the key map between the Linux text
       console and the various X terminals.  It may be slightly different on
       certain X terminals depending on which keys they consume for their own
       use.  Turn off any key recognition by the terminal for its own purposes
       (menu access, help display, etc.) if possible.  Pay special attention
       to the F1-F12 and Alt-<char> keys.  Moreover, on some systems you must
       set the TERM=linux or TERM=rxvt environment variables.  This also works
       under VNC.

       Certain key combinations will probably not be useable as the Linux
       console consumes Alt-F1 through Alt-Fx (often F7, but could be greater)
       for switching its virtual consoles.  Likewise, the various desktop
       environments consume key combinations for their own use.  Ctrl-F1
       through Ctrl-Fx are used to switch desktop workspaces.  Alt-Fx
       combinations are used for various desktop features and are unavailable
       for Tlf use.

       Some desktop terminal emulators are capable of being configured to
       allow the application running in them to get all of the keys the
       desktop environment does not consume.  In testing good choices seem to
       be Gnome Terminal, Rox Terminal, or the classic Xterm (although its
       color representation differs from the Linux console and other terminal
       emulators).  Xfce Terminal is known to consume F11 and Ctrl-PageUp and
       Ctrl-PageDown.  The Tlf developers have implemented Alt-PageUp and Alt-
       PageDown as a work-around for the Ctrl counterparts.  Reports of
       success with other terminals are welcome.

   Call Input and Exchange Fields
       The Call Input and Exchange Fields are the two main entry fields of Tlf
       where the majority of the keyboard entry takes place.  The call input
       field is active when Tlf completes its initialization and presents the
       main screen.

       Most key sequences are the same in both fields.  Differences are noted
       as necessary.

       A-Z, 0-9, /
              Call input: ASCII letters, numerals, and the '/' characters that
              make up an internationally recognized amateur radio callsign
              plus temporary location identifiers.  Spaces are not allowed.

              Exchange: information provided by the other station possibly
              separated by spaces, e.g., ARRL Field Day and ARRL Sweepstakes.

       Space  Switches from call input to exchange field.  Separates exchange
              field elements when multiple exchange elements must be entered,
              e.g., ARRL Field Day and ARRL Sweepstakes.

       Tab    Switch between call input and exchange fields (jump back to call
              input from exchange field).

       Enter  Smart key depending on contest mode.

              Tlf follows the TR operating style which has two modes, CQ and
              S&P.

              CQ mode is used for “running”, i.e., staying on one frequency
              and having other stations answer your call.
              S&P mode is for tuning up or down the band and answering the
              calls of other stations.

              In CQ Mode:

              • With the call input field empty, ‘Enter’ sends the F12 message
                (Auto CQ).

              • With characters in the call input field, ‘Enter’ answers the
                calling station by sending the F3 message (RST) and moves the
                cursor to the exchange field.

              • If the exchange field is empty, ‘Enter’ repeats the F3 message
                (RST).

              • After the exchange information received from the other station
                is entered, ‘Enter’ sends the CQ_TU_MSG message if defined, or
                “TU” and your call otherwise.  Afterwards it logs the QSO, and
                returns the cursor to the call input field to answer the next
                call.

              In S&P Mode:

              • When the call input field is empty, ‘Enter’ sends the
                S&P_CALL_MSG if defined, or your call otherwise.

              • When the exchange field is empty, ‘Enter’ sends the
                S&P_CALL_MSG if defined, or your call otherwise.

              • When the call input field has been filled, ‘Enter’ sends the
                S&P_CALL_MSG if defined, or your call otherwise.  Afterwards
                it moves the cursor to the exchange field.

              • Once the exchange has been received, ‘Enter’ sends the
                S&P_TU_MSG if defined, otherwise it sends your call followed
                by the F3 message (RST).  Afterwards it logs the QSO and
                returns the cursor to the call input field to answer the next
                call.

       Backspace
              Erases the character to the left of the cursor and moves the
              cursor one position to the left.

       Escape Stop CW transmission, clears characters, returns to call input
              field, keyboard off (universal undo).

              As an example, characters have been entered in both the call
              input and exchange fields, the cursor is in the exchange field,
              and the transmission of a CW message is in progress.  The first
              press of ‘Escape’ will stop the CW transmission and clear the
              exchange field and position the cursor to the leftmost position
              of the exchange field.  The second press of ‘Escape’ will move
              the cursor to the right of the last character in the call input
              field.  The third press of ‘Escape’ will clear the call input
              field.

       ← (Left-Arrow)
              Change to next band lower or wrap to highest band if already on
              the lowest band when callsign field empty.

              Enter edit mode if one or more characters are present and move
              the cursor to the left of the rightmost character.

       → (Right-Arrow)
              Change to next band higher or wrap to the lowest band if already
              on the highest band when call input field is empty.

       F1     In CQ mode, send message F1 (CQ).
              In S&P mode send message F6 (MY).

       Shift-F1
              Restore previous CQ frequency from MEM and send message F1 (CQ).

       F2-F11 Send CW, RTTY or VOICE messages 2 through 11.

       F12    Start Auto_CQ (only from call input field).  Sends F12 message
              repeatedly pausing for Auto_CQ delay time between messages.
              Auto_CQ is cancelled with first character entry into the call
              input field.

       + (Plus)
              Toggle between the CQ and S&P modes.

       PgUp   Increase CW (Morse Code) speed (from call and exchange fields).

              If the cursor is in the call input field and it is not empty and
              CHANGE_RST is set: increase his S value (the leftmost of the RST
              pair).

              If the cursor is in the exchange field and it is not empty and
              CHANGE_RST is set: increase my S value (the rightmost of the RST
              pair).

       PgDown Decrease CW (Morse Code) speed (from call input and exchange
              fields).

              If the cursor is in the call input field and it is not empty and
              CHANGE_RST is set: decrease his S value (the leftmost of the RST
              pair).

              If the cursor is in the exchange field and it is not empty and
              CHANGE_RST is set: decrease my S value (the rightmost of the RST
              pair).

       Ctrl-PgUp
       Alt-PgUp
              Increase Auto_CQ delay pause length (+1/2 sec).

              Set Auto_CQ delay to message length + pause length.

       Ctrl-PgDown
       Alt-PgDown
              Decrease Auto_CQ delay pause length (-1/2 sec).

              As some terminals, Xfce Terminal is one such, consume Ctrl-
              PageUp/Ctrl-PageDown, the Alt-key combinations allow for setting
              the Auto_CQ delay pause length.

              NB: If neither key combination works try :CQD instead.

   CT Compatible Mode
       Tlf has limited support for the logging sequence keys used in the once
       popular CT logging program.  Unlike the default Enter _Sends _Message
       (ESM) mode, the CT Compatible mode uses the Insert and + keys in the
       logging sequence and Enter logs a complete QSO.  Unlike ESM mode, CT
       mode does not have separate CQ or S&P modes.

       CT Compatible mode is enabled with the CTCOMPATIBLE keyword in
       logcfg.dat (see the PREFERENCES section below).

       The following keys differ in behavior in CT Compatible mode.

       Enter  Log the complete QSO without sending any message macro.

              If the callsign field is empty, pressing Enter will activate the
              Auto-CQ function.  If the exchange field is empty, pressing
              Enter in either the callsign or exchange field will result in no
              action.

       Insert Send the RST (F3) macro.

              Since the RST macro includes the other station's callsign by
              default, the HIS macro is not sent first.  This differs from
              classic CT, but is a compromise to use the default Tlf macros.

       + (Plus)
              Send the TU macro and log the QSO.

              The + key checks if the exchange field is empty and if it is
              nothing is sent or logged.  In rare cases where nothing needs to
              be entered in the exchange field, e.g. working DX from USA in
              ARRL 160, simply enter a space to allow the + key to send the TU
              message and log the QSO.

       Alt-V  Change CW speed.

PREFERENCES
       Tlf can be fully configured by editing the logcfg.dat file.  Normally
       you keep one logcfg.dat file, setting up your callsign, the log file
       name, the ports and addresses for packet, the radio, the network etc.,
       and a separate rules file per contest.

       The logcfg.dat file can be edited from within Tlf by the :CFG or :SET
       commands (or with any other plain text editor before starting Tlf).

       You can set your favourite editor in the logcfg.dat file.

       You connect the rules file by using the statement
       RULES=contest_rules_file_name in logcfg.dat.

       Tlf will first look in the working directory for a logcfg.dat file, and
       if it cannot find one it will look in /usr/local/share/tlf for a
       default one.  Make sure you edit the logcfg.dat file at least to hold
       your call and your preferred system configuration.

LOGCFG.DAT STATEMENTS
       Configuration parameters set in logcfg.dat located in the working
       directory (where Tlf is started).

       RULES=contest_rules_filename
              Name of the rules file to load.  It helps if you name the rules
              file according to the contest you want to describe.

       SYNCFILE=user:password@host/dir/syncfile
              File on remote host you want to synchronize with (use wget(1)
              syntax).

       CTCOMPATIBLE
              Do not use the TR-Log QSO sequence, but use ‘+’, ‘Insert’ and
              ‘Enter’ to log the QSO.

              The default mode of operation is the TR-Log sequence which uses
              ‘+’ to switch between CQ and S&P modes, in which ‘Enter’ is the
              sole key used to call the other station, send the exchange, and
              log the QSO.

       TLFCOLORn=FG/BG
              Defaults:
                     TLFCOLOR1=23 (Header and footer)
                     TLFCOLOR2=67 (Pop up windows)
                     TLFCOLOR3=70 (Log window)
                     TLFCOLOR4=57 (Markers/dupe colour)
                     TLFCOLOR5=43 (Input fields)
                     TLFCOLOR6=63 (Window frames)

              The numbers are given in octal, FG/BG or BG/FG (some
              experimentation likely required).

              You should only specify these if you wish to modify the standard
              colours of Tlf.  In some Terminals you can set a special profile
              for Tlf with your own colours.  Another way is to define the
              colours via the $HOME/.Xresources file.

       EDITOR=nano | vi[m] | <your_favorite_editor>
              Editor used to modify the QSO log or logcfg.dat.  The command
              specified receives the file name as an argument.

              When using a GUI editor that runs in the background (e.g. gvim)
              make sure to exit the editor before logging new stations. You
              also have to use :RES command to reread the log and correct
              scoring.

              Best is to force the editor to stay in foreground (e.g. with
              'gvim -f').

       CALL=PA0R
              Your call used in messages and used to determine your country,
              zone and continent.

       TIME_OFFSET=0
              Used to shift the Tlf time with respect to the computer clock.
              Normally 0.  Range: 0–23.

       TIME_MASTER
              This node transmits the time over the network (only one master
              allowed!).

       ADDNODE=Node_address[:Port_number]
              Adds an IP address (and optionally a port number) to which we
              broadcast stuff.  (WARNING: Only add addresses of other nodes).

       THISNODE=A
              Node designator (default “A”).  If Tlf hears its own node ID on
              the network it will exit and ask you to pick another one!
              Range: A–H.

       LAN_PORT=Portnumber
              Specifies on which portnumber (default “6788”) Tlf is listening
              for broadcasts from other instances.

       LANDEBUG
              Switches on the debug function.  Dumps all Tlf net traffic
              received on this node into a file named debuglog in the working
              directory.  This log can be used as a backup log for the whole
              network, as it is easy to retrieve QSO data, cluster messages,
              gab messages etc. after the contest.  Some users have this
              enabled all the time.

       NETKEYER
              Switches the CW keyer on.  Only the IP networked keyer cwdaemon
              or any other program that emulates cwdaemon such as winkeydaemon
              is supported.  You may also need the keyer for PTT control or
              band info output.

       NETKEYERPORT=port_number
              Default port is 6789.

       NETKEYERHOST=host_address
              Default host is 127.0.0.1 (localhost).

       MFJ1278_KEYER=serial_port
              Activates support for the MFJ-1278B multi-mode controller.  The
              MFJ-1278 supports CW as well as RTTY contesting.  Fixed serial
              port rate is 9600 bps.

       CWSPEED=speed_in_WPM
              Range: 4–69.

       WEIGHT=weight_ratio
              Set the dot to dash ratio.  Only for the NETKEYER.  Range:
              -45–50.

       TXDELAY=PTT_delay_in_mS
              Delay activation of the Push To Talk pin.  Range: 0–50.

       KEYER_BACKSPACE
              Support backspace key in keyer window.

       SOUNDCARD
              Use soundcard for sidetone output.

       SIDETONE_VOLUME=soundcard_volume
              Set soundcard sidetone volume (default is 70).  A value of 0
              turns off sidetone output (even for the console speaker).
              Range: 0–99.

       CQDELAY=Auto_cq
              Set automatic CQ pause delay in 1/2 seconds increments between
              message transmissions.  Range: 3–60.

       CWTONE=sidetone
              Set the PC speaker or soundcard frequency.  A value of 0
              switches the sidetone off.  Range: 0–999.

              (Due to a bug in cwdaemon it also turns off the Alt-T tune
              function.  Use SIDETONE_VOLUME=0 instead).

       BANDOUTPUT
              Outputs band information to pins 2, 7, 8, 9 on the parallel
              port.  Output is 1 (160m), 2 (80m) ... 9 (10m).  This format is
              compatible with the standard interface for antenna switches,
              band filters etc.

       BANDOUTPUT=124181818
              Output pin 2 for 160, 30, 17 and 12, pin 7 for 80, pin 8 for 40,
              and pin 9 for 20, 15 and 10.  This comes in handy when you have
              3 dipoles and a 3-band beam (...).

       NO_BANDSWITCH_ARROWKEYS
              This will prevent unwanted band switching when you are not using
              rig control.  Band up = Alt-B, band down = Alt-V (TR-Log
              compatible).

       TELNETHOST=cluster_address
              Use Telnet to connect to a DX Cluster node using a DNS name or
              IP address, e.g. claudia.esrac.ele.tue.nl or 131.155.192.179.

       TELNETPORT=telnet_port_of_cluster
              DX Clusters often use a non-standard port for Telnet, e.g. 8000.

       TNCPORT=serial_port
              You can use /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyUSB1, etc. anything that looks
              like a tty.

       TNCSPEED=serial_rate
              Tlf supports 1200, 2400, 4800 and 9600 bps.

       FIFO_INTERFACE
              The FIFO (First In First Out) interface is used when you want to
              receive cluster info from the network, or from another source.
              The FIFO interface uses a special FIFO file in the working
              directory called clfile.  Anything you dump into this FIFO will
              be displayed by the packet interface.

       RADIO_CONTROL
              Switches the radio interface on.  The rig interface makes use of
              the Hamlib library which supports a number of different rigs.

       RIGMODEL=rig_number
              Look at the Hamlib documentation for the rig_number.

              Hint: rigctl -l and its manual page (rigctl(1)).

       RIGSPEED=serial_rate
              Speed of the serial port for rig control.

       RIGPORT=serial_port
              You can use /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyUSB1, etc. anything that looks
              like a tty.

              RPC rig daemon users should use RIGMODEL=1901 and
              RIGPORT=localhost.  In this case RIGSPEED is ignored (NB: rig
              model 1901 is deprecated in Hamlib releases 3.0 and later and is
              replaced by rigctld(8) which is rig model 2).

       RIGCONF=rig_configuration_parameters
              Send rig configuration parameters to Hamlib.
              e.g. RIGCONF=civaddr=0x40,retry=3,rig_pathname=/dev/ttyS0

       RIT_CLEAR
              Clears the RIT after logging the qso.  This only works if the
              rig, and the Hamlib routine supports it (tested on the OMNI 6+).

       RIGPTT Declares that Hamlib CAT PTT capability should be checked at
              startup and if available use it to activate the radio's PTT for
              sending voice messages instead of the NetKeyer PTT.

       CWBANDWIDTH=width
              Sets the CW bandwidth of your rig when changing bands.  If unset
              or 0 the default bandwidth (as determined by Hamlib) is used. (a
              valid bandwidth for the rig must be used).

       SC_DEVICE=device
              Sound card device for scan function.
              e.g. SC_DEVICE=/dev/dsp0

       SSBMODE
              Start Tlf in SSB mode (default is CW).

       RTTYMODE
              Start Tlf in RTTY mode (defaul is CW)

       GMFSK=$HOME/gMFSK.log
              Tell miniterm(1) where to get the data.

       DIGIMODEM=$HOME/gmfsk_autofile
              Tell Tlf where to send the macros.

       CLUSTER
              Show cluster window at startup.

       CLUSTERLOGIN=yourcall
              Automatic login for the telnet client.

       CLUSTER_LOG
              Write clusterlog to disk.

       BANDMAP
              Shows cluster bandmap on startup.  Use '.' to change bandmap
              filtering.

       BANDMAP=xyz,number
              Show cluster bandmap on startup and set start values for
              filtering.
              <xyz> string parsed for:
                   “B” - only own band
                   “M” - only own mode
                   “D” - do not show dupes
                   “S” - skip dupes during grab_next (Ctrl-G)
                   “O” - show only multiplier (CQWW only)
              <number> livetime for new spots in seconds (number >= 30)

       SCOREWINDOW
              Show the score window (same as Alt-R).

       CHECKWINDOW
              Show the country/call check window.

       PARTIALS
              Show a list of possible contest calls.

       USEPARTIALS
              Use the auto-complete utility (takes some practice...).  Tlf
              will complete the call as soon as it is unique in the database.
              This can of course lead to strange effects, but in practice
              there are far more hits than misses.  Sometimes you must edit
              the call because it has locked on a unique call.  Try it, and
              switch it off when you don't like it.

       LOGFREQUENCY
              Put frequency (kHz) into QSO number to enable logging of
              frequency (only QSO and dxped mode).

       IGNOREDUPES
              Enable to allow multiple QSOs in a contest with the same station
              (considered a good idea these days as contest bots will take
              care of dupes).

       SUNSPOTS=SSN
              Set the sunspots value which is used to do a rough calculation
              of the MUF.  If the cluster interface is used the SSN will be
              updated by WWV or WCY messages.

       SFI=Solar_flux_value
              Set SFI used to calculate SSN.  The SSN value is used to do a
              rough calculation of the MUF.  If the packet interface is used
              the SSN will be updated by WWV or WCY messages.

       CHANGE_RST
              If set in logcfg.dat, PgUp and PgDown will change RST instead of
              CW speed if field is not empty.
              Default is Off.

       NOB4   Do not send automatic “QSO B4” message.
              Default is On.

       NOAUTOCQ
              No automatic CQ when pressing ‘Enter’ or ‘F12’.

       MARKERS=file_name
              Generate marker file for Xplanet.  Xplanet will show the last 8
              spots on an azimuthal map.  See the relevant Xplanet
              documentation.  Use azimuthal projection and center the map on
              your QTH.

       POWERMULT=power_multiplier
              Use this value to multiply the final points.  If the contest
              rule allows one to use the power multiplier (e.g. Stewperry,
              ARRL-FD), you can pass that here.

              NB: The type of POWERMULT is a float, e.g. POWERMULT=1.5, but
              the final score will be rounded by the C library floor(3)
              function, which gives the largest integer value that is not
              greater than multiplied score.

       SEND_DE
              Sends a “DE” word before your callsign, e.g. “DE W1AW”. There is
              a special case: if SEND_DE is present in logcfg.dat, and Tlf if
              is in DIGIMODE, then the other station's callsign will be sent
              before “DE”, e.g. “DL1A DE W1AW”.

       DIGI_RIG_MODE=mode
              If set with RADIO_CONTROL option, specifies the mode to change
              the rig to when :DIG mode is selected. mode may be one of “USB”,
              “LSB”, “RTTY”, or “RTTYR”.  If not set, “USB” is used if FLDIGI
              is set and “LSB” is used otherwise.

RULES
       The contest rules can be put into separate files.  Tlf will first look
       for a directory called rules/ in the working directory, and a file
       named for the contest, e.g.  cqww.  If Tlf cannot find such a file, it
       will look into the directory /usr/local/share/tlf/rules.  A rules file
       contains contest specific parameters like multipliers, scoring rules,
       CW and voice keyer messages, etc.

       NB: The rules file overrides settings from the logcfg.dat file!

       WARNING!  It is your own responsibility to try these rules well BEFORE
       the contest.  The authors of Tlf cannot possibly check all rules for
       all contests :) and during the contest there is normally no time to fix
       it.

       CONTEST=xxxxx
              Name of the contest (same as the file name contest_name
              referenced above).  Some contests, like CQWW and WPX, are pre-
              programmed.  Look for the relevant rules file in
              /usr/local/share/tlf/rules.

       LOGFILE=log_file_name
              Mandatory!

       CABRILLO=cabrillo_format
              Specify the name of the cabrillo format to use (see
              doc/README.cab).

       CONTEST_MODE
              Sets Tlf into contest mode.  Do not use this parameter for
              normal QSO logging!

       NO_RST Do not use RST in contest, e.g. for CW Open, ARRL Sweepstakes,
              or ARRL Field Day.  If you want to write a Cabrillo log you must
              provide a conforming format definition without RST values.

       CQWW_M2
              Put the node ID into the logline (just after the QSO number) to
              support Multi/2 operation where the station logging the QSO must
              be in the Cabrillo file.  This can also be used for M/1 and M/M,
              to enable post-contest analysis of the nodes.

       Macro characters in the messages
              % = mycall, @ = hiscall, # = serial number, [ = RST, + =
              increase cw speed, - = decrease cw speed, * = AR, = = BT, < =
              SK, ( = KN, !  = SN, & = AS, > = BK, !  = his serial (e.g.
              confirm exchange of station in DIGIMODE).

              Query message (e.g. ?).

       F10="cw message 10"
              QRZ message (e.g. QRZ?).

       F11="cw message 11"
              Please reply message (e.g. PSE K).

       F12="cw message 12"
              Auto-CQ message (e.g. +++TEST %---).

       CQ_TU_MSG="cw message 13"
              Auto Exchange message in CQ mode (TR-Log mode), (e.g. TU %).

       S&P_TU_MSG="cw message 14"
              Auto Exchange message in S&P mode (TR-Log mode), (e.g. TU 5NN
              #).

       S&P_CALL_MSG="cw message 25"
              Custom call message in S&P mode.  Allows replacing the auto-
              generated S&P call message.

              Up to 10 additional messages.

       SHORT_SERIAL
              Uses short form for serial number (599=5NN, 001=TT1).

       LONG_SERIAL
              Uses long form for serial number (default).

       VKM1=voice message file name 1 ... VKM12=voice message file name 12
              Use F1 ... F12 keys to send recorded messages for phone.

       VKCQM=voice_message_file_name
              Auto Exchange voice message in CQ mode (TR-Log mode)

              Points per CW QSO.

       SSBPOINTS=d
              Points per SSB QSO.
              NB: SSBPOINTS and CWPOINTS need to be set for both to work!

       MY_COUNTRY_POINTS=d
              Points for working your own DXCC entity (often zero (0)).

       MY_CONTINENT_POINTS=d
              Points for working countries in your own continent.

       DX_POINTS=d
              Points for working a station in other continents.

       2EU3DX_POINTS
              Deprecated.  Use MY_CONTINENT_POINTS and DX_POINTS instead.

       COUNTRY_LIST_POINTS=d
              Points for countries in country list.

       USE_COUNTRYLIST_ONLY
              Score zero points for countries not in the list.

       COUNTRYLIST="comma separated list of prefixes starting with colon"
              e.g. Scandinavia:SM,LA,OZ,OH.

       COUNTRYLIST=file_name
              File with a list of prefixes.

       PORTABLE_MULT_2
              Multiply points x2 for portable stations (e.g. R1 field day).

       LOWBAND_DOUBLE
              Double all points for lowband (40, 80, and 160m) QSOs (can be
              combined with any other value). (Will be deprecated in future!
              Use BANDWEIGHT_POINTS instead.)

       WYSIWYG_MULTIBAND
              Exchange is multiplier, per band, whatever you enter.  Tlf
              builds its own list of multipliers.

       WYSIWYG_ONCE
              Exchange is multiplier, whatever you enter.  Counts once for the
              whole contest (not per band).

       WAZMULT
              Multiplier is the CQ zone (per band).

       ITUMULT
              Multiplier is the ITU zone (per band).

       PFX_MULT
              Multiplier is prefix (PA0, DA2, VE7, etc.).  Counted once per
              contest, not per band.

       PFX_MULT_MULTIBAND
              Same as WPX, but the WPX only used CQ-WW-WPX, and there a single
              prefix multiplier only once, not all band. With this option, the
              PFX counts as multiplier on all band. This usable on AA-DX.

       COUNTRY_MULT
              Multiplier is the DXCC entity (per band).

       MULT_LIST=file_name
              Name of multipliers file (often sections, provinces, states,
              counties).  May contain comment lines starting with “#” in the
              first column. Each multiplier resides on a single line by
              itself.

              Starting from Tlf-1.4 on you can also use aliases for the
              multipliers. Define the aliases as

                  multiplier:alias1,alias2,alias3

              If you log a QSO with one of the aliases  it will be counted for
              as the according multiplier. You can have more than one line for
              the same multiplier.

       SECTION_MULT
              Multiplier is section from multipliers file.

       SERIAL+SECTION
              Exchange is serial number and section, multiplier is section
              from multiplier file.  Mults count per band.

       SERIAL_OR_SECTION
              Exchange is serial number or section.  This option is similar to
              SERIAL+SECTION, except the exchange could be a serial OR the
              section.  The options was introduced for HA-DX, where HA
              stations give the shortest form of their county, other stations
              give serial.

       SERIAL+GRID4
              Exchange is serial number and grid (e.g. JO21QI), multipler is
              4-character grid (JO21).  Mults count per band.

       DX_&_SECTIONS
              Multiplier is DXCC country or section from multiplier file.

       RECALL_MULTS
              Exchange can be recycled, will be filled into exchange field
              when it is known (see also INITIAL_EXCHANGE).

       INITIAL_EXCHANGE=exchanges.txt
              The file must contain a comma-separated list of exchanges, if
              e.g. the exchange is the name of the operator:
              PA0R,rein
              PG4I,joop
              OK1RR,martin

              If RECALL_MULTS is set, Tlf will look in this list for the
              exchange and fill it in for you.  There are various contests
              which have a standard exchange, like e.g. the FOC Marathon.  The
              module also recognises embedded calls (CT3/PA0R/QRP).

       CALLMASTER=callmaster
              Allow to name a different file used as callmaster database
              (default is 'callmaster'). See FILES section.

       CONTINENT_EXCHANGE
              Exchange is continent (NA, SA, EU, AS, AF, OC).

       SERIAL_EXCHANGE
              Exchange is serial number (formats exchange field).

       MIXED  Station can be worked both in SSB and CW.

       SSBMODE
              Start Tlf in SSB mode.

       MYQRA  For the “Stewperry” contest, this option is used to set the QRA,
              e.g.: JN97, or the full form: JN97OM.  In Stewperry, the points
              are calculated based on the distance between the stations.

       QTC    If you want to send or receive QTC's on contest (usually on
              WAEDC), put this option to logcfg.dat. This needs a parameter,
              which could be one of these: RECV, SEND, BOTH - note, that
              currently just the RECV works. For more information, please see
              the README_QTC.txt file.

       QTC_CAP_CALLS=list_of_qtc_capable_callsigns.txt
              If you want to help yourself to indicate that the station is QTC
              capable, you can see it on your bandmap or worked window. Put
              the callsign of stations in a file, one callsign per line, and
              give it as an argument to this variable.

       QTC_AUTO_FILLTIME
              If you use QTC feature, and you are on EU station in CW/SSB
              modes, then you can only RECEIVE the QTC's. Most sender station
              send their QTC's as a most short form, example, after the first
              line it doesn't send the first two characters of time field. If
              you set this option, then when you fill the first QTC line, then
              Tlf will fills the other time fields, only the first two
              characters. Of course, if you change the hour (eg., if there is
              a time: 2059, and the next one is 2100), then all next time
              fields will be changed.

       QTC_RECV_LAZY
              If you use QTC feature, and you are on EU station in CW/SSB
              modes, then you can use this feature. In normal case, Tlf checks
              all received QTC lines: the time field must be 4 characters
              long, callsign and serial fields must be non-empty. If you set
              up this option, Tlf will ignore this restrictions.

       CONTINENTLIST="comma separated list of continents"
              Valid values are: SA, NA, EU, AF, AS and OC.

       CONTINENT_LIST_POINTS=d
              Points for stations from continents in CONTINENTLIST

       USE_CONTINENTLIST_ONLY
              Score zero points for station from continents not in the list.

       BANDWEIGHT_POINTS
              Allow a point weighting factor for different bands. E.g.
              BANDWEIGHT_POINTS=160:3,80:2,40:1,20:1,15:1,10:2
              can be used for AADX contest. It will multiply all QSO points by
              3 on 160m, by 2 on 80m and 10m and on all other bands only by 1.

              Bands not in list are weighted by 1.

       BANDWEIGHT_MULTIS
              Allow a weigthing factor for multipliers on different bands.
              E.g.
              BANDWEIGHT_MULTIS=80:4,40:3,20:2,15:2,10:2
              can be used for WAEDC contest. It will multiply the number of
              multipliers on 80 by 4, on 40 by 3 and on 20/15/10 by 2.

              The multiply operation is executed after any other multiplier
              modification.

              Bands not in list will be weighted by 1.

       PFX_NUM_MULTIS
              On WAEDC (and maybe with other contests too) the multipliers are
              the different countries, but there are some exceptions where of
              certain countries a different prefix number is a different
              multiplier. On WAEDC these countries are: W, VE, VK, ZL, ZS, JA,
              PY and RA8/RA9 and RAØ.  With this option, you can list the
              affected countries: PFX_NUM_MULTIS=W,VE,VK,ZL,ZS,JA,PY,UA9.  Tlf
              will read these items, make a lookup in a countrylist for a
              country code, and that code will be used.  If you include the
              UA9 prefix and then make a QSO with a station from Asiatic
              Russia, the PFX number will evaulated with a new multiplier, but
              European Russia will not.

       EXCLUDE_MULTILIST
              Some contests have a special multipliers list, which is easier
              to write with by excluding a predefined set. For example, the
              main set could be COUNTRY_MULT, and you need to exclude from
              that list just a few countries, e.g. the SAC contest excludes
              the Scandinavian countries as they are not multipliers). In that
              case you can use this configuration:
                  COUNTRY_MULT
                  COUNTRYLIST=sac:JW,JX,LA,OF1,OF0,OJ1,OJ0,OX,OW,OZ,SM,TF
                  EXCLUDE_MULTILIST=COUNTRYLIST
              Another useful example at WAEDC RTTY contest: then all stations
              can work each other, for EU stations only the non-EU stations
              are the multi's, and reverse: for non-EU stations only the EU
              stations are the multipliers. In that case the EU stations can
              use this config:
                  CONTINENTLIST=EU
                  COUNTRY_MULT
                  EXCLUDE_MULTILIST=CONTINENTLIST
              Now all country are multi, except the EU stations. In this
              contest the non-EU stations can use this config:
                  CONTINENTLIST=SA,NA,AF,AS,OC
                  COUNTRY_MULT
                  EXCLUDE_MULTILIST=CONTINENTLIST
              In this example all countries are multis, except from SA, NA,
              AF, OC and AS continent, so only the EU stations left as
              multipliers.

       BMAUTOGRAB
              If set, with RADIO_CONTROL and BANDMAP (mandatory) options, Tlf
              will grab the callsign from bandmap, if the TRX frequency is
              equal with bandmap freq.

       BMAUTOADD
              If set, with RADIO_CONTROL and BANDMAP (mandatory) options, Tlf
              will add the callsign from callsign field, if at least 3
              character have been entered. Use “S”kip dupes in BANDMAP
              settings to control if it should also grab dupes.

       SPRINTMODE
              If set, Tlf will automatically switch its mode between LOG and
              S&P after every QSO.

       FLDIGI If you work RTTY (or any other digital modes), you can
              communicate with Fldigi through XMLRPC. The FLDIGI keyword will
              activate the interface.  By default it connects to
              http://localhost:7362/RPC2 <http://localhost:7362/RPC2>.

              If you run Fldigi's xmlrpc server on an different port use
              FLDIGI=http://localhost:port_#/RPC2

       MINITEST [=NNN]
              Use this option when the contest is a minitest like contest. In
              that contests the full contest intervall is divided into shorter
              sections (e.g. 6 * 10 minute sections in an hour).  Any station
              can be worked once in each of the time sections without counting
              as dupe.  The default length of the sections is 600 seconds (10
              minutes), but you can pass another value (in seconds) after the
              '=' sign. There must be an integral number of time sections per
              hour!

       UNIQUE_CALL_MULTI
              Multiplier is callsign.  You have to pass one of these
              arguments: ALL, BAND.

              Example:

                  UNIQUE_CALL_MULTI=BAND

              The argument tells Tlf, how to score the callsigns as
              multipliers:
              ALL means the callsign is a multiplier, independet of band.
              BAND means the callsign counts as multiplier on different bands.

       DKF1=digi keyer message 1 ... DKF12=digi keyer message 12
              Use F1 ... F12 keys to send recorded messages for phone.

       DKCQM=message
              Auto Exchange TU digi message in CQ mode (TR-Log mode)

       DKSPM=message
              Auto Exchange TU digi message in S&P mode (TR-Log mode)

       DKSPC=message
              Auto Exchange call digi message in S&P mode (TR-Log mode)

FILES
       /usr/local/share/tlf/logcfg.dat is a recent example of the
       configuration file Tlf needs to know what to do.  Tlf won't start
       without one.  Copy it into the working directory and edit it before
       use.  You should do your experiments well before the contest.  It
       contains, amongst other settings, your call, name of the log file, info
       about ports for CW keying, packet or rig control, contest rules,
       points, multipliers etc.

       /usr/local/share/tlf/rules/contestname contains the rules of the
       various contests.  You can easily write one for your favourite contest
       making use of the various multiplier and points capabilities.  Check it
       before the contest and send a message to the Tlf development list
       <tlf-devel@nongnu.org> if anything is wrong (or right!).

       /usr/local/share/tlf/cty.dat contains a flat ASCII database of info
       about countries.  This is the same file as used by CT or TR-Log.
       Updated versions from Jim, AD1C, are available from: Country Files
       <http://www.country-files.com/>.

       /usr/local/share/tlf/callmaster contains a flat ASCII database of known
       contest callsigns.  Updates are available from Super Check Partial
       <http://www.supercheckpartial.com/>.  Save the master.scp file as
       callmaster in the working directory (or use CALLMASTER=master.scp to
       use that file).  It will take precedence over the system installed
       callmaster.

       Section files contain a flat ASCII database of multpliers like states,
       sections, provinces, districts, names, ages, etc.  They are invoked by
       including MULT_LIST=section_file_name in the rules file.

DOCUMENTATION
       An operation manual (a little bit outdated) is available in HTML format
       at the old Tlf project page
       <http://sharon.esrac.ele.tue.nl/pub/linux/ham/tlf/>.

       An FAQ and other useful tips are installed in the system doc directory
       under tlf.

BUGS
       Please send bug reports to the Tlf development list
