powerman(1)                        powerman                        powerman(1)

NAME
       powerman - power on/off nodes

SYNOPSIS
       pm [-options] -action [targets] [-action [targets] ...]

DESCRIPTION
       powerman provides power management in a data center or compute cluster
       environment.  It performs operations such as power on, power off, and
       power cycle via remote power controller (RPC) devices.  Target
       hostnames are mapped to plugs on RPC devices in powerman.conf(5).

OPTIONS
       -1, --on targets
              Power ON targets.

       -0, --off targets
              Power OFF targets.

       -c, --cycle targets
              Power cycle targets.

       -r, --reset targets
              Assert hardware reset for targets (if implemented by RPC).

       -f, --flash targets
              Turn beacon ON for targets (if implemented by RPC).

       -u, --unflash targets
              Turn beacon OFF for targets (if implemented by RPC).

       -l, --list
              List available targets.  If possible, output will be compressed
              into a host range (see TARGET SPECIFICATION below).

       -q, --query-all
              Query plug status of all targets.  Status is not cached;  each
              time this option is used, powermand queries the appropriate
              RPC's.  Targets connected to RPC's that could not be contacted
              (e.g. due to network failure) are reported as status "unknown".
              If possible, output will be compressed into host ranges.

       -Q, --query targets
              Query plug status of specific targets.

       -n, --soft-all
              Query soft power status of all targets (if implemented by RPC).
              In this context, a node in the OFF state could be ON at the plug
              but operating in standby power mode.

       -N, --soft targets
              Query soft power status of specific targets (if implemented by
              RPC).

       -b, --beacon-all
              Query beacon status of all targets (if implemented by RPC).

       -B, --beacon targets
              Query beacon status of specific targets (if implemented by RPC).

       -t, --temp-all
              Query node temperature of all targets (if implemented by RPC).
              Temperature information is not interpreted by powerman and is
              reported as received from the RPC on one line per target,
              prefixed by target name.

       -P, --temp targets
              Query node temperature of specific targets (if implemented by
              RPC).

       -L, --license
              Show powerman license information.

       -h, --server-host host[:port]
              Connect to a powerman daemon on non-default host and optionally
              port.

       -V, --version
              Display the powerman version number and exit.

       -D, --device
              Displays RPC status information.  If targets are specified, only
              RPC's matching the target list are displayed.

       -T, --telemetry
              Causes RPC telemetry information to be displayed as commands are
              processed.  Useful for debugging device scripts.

       -x, --exprange
              Expand host ranges in query responses.

       -g, --genders
              If configured with the genders(3) package, this option tells
              powerman that targets are genders attributes that map to node
              names rather than the node names themselves.

TARGET SPECIFICATION
       powerman target hostnames may be specified as comma separated or space
       separated hostnames or host ranges.  Host ranges are of the general
       form: prefix[n-m,l-k,...], where n < m and l < k, etc., This form
       should not be confused with regular expression character classes (also
       denoted by ``[]''). For example, foo[19] does not represent foo1 or
       foo9, but rather represents a degenerate range: foo19.

       This range syntax is meant only as a convenience on clusters with a
       prefixNN naming convention and specification of ranges should not be
       considered necessary -- the list foo1,foo9 could be specified as such,
       or by the range foo[1,9].

       Some examples of powerman targets follows:

       Power on hosts bar,baz,foo01,foo02,...,foo05
           powerman --on bar baz foo[01-05]

       Power on hosts bar,foo7,foo9,foo10
           powerman --on bar,foo[7,9-10]

       Power on foo0,foo4,foo5
           powerman --on foo[0,4-5]

       As a reminder to the reader, some shells will interpret brackets ([ and
       ]) for pattern matching.  Depending on your shell, it may be necessary
       to enclose ranged lists within quotes.  For example, in tcsh, the last
       example above should be executed as:
           powerman --on "foo[0,4-5]"
