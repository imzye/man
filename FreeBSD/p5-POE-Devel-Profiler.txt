ABSTRACT
               Profiles POE programs for useful data

DESCRIPTION
       This module profiles POE programs, in the same way the Devel::DProf
       family of modules do.

       Currently, POE::Devel::Profiler will profile the following:

               Program start/end
               Session create/destruction
               alarm_set
               delay_set
               signal
               alias_set
               yield/post/call from a session
               entering an event ( also includes _default states and failed states )
               Garbage Collection on a session

       POE::Devel::Profiler will not profile:

               Anything not mentioned above :)

NOTES
   Compatibility?
       This module is currently compatible only with POE::Session, further
       work will be needed.

   POE Options
       If you want to set POE options like ASSERT_DEFAULT, it is currently not
       possible with this module. The only way to do it is to set environment
       variables or hardcode the following in your program:

               sub POE::Kernel::ASSERT_DEFAULT () { 1 }
               use POE::Devel::Profiler;
               use POE;

   Loading POE
       POE::Devel::Profiler MUST be loaded before POE or craziness will
       ensue...

   Profiler data
       The profile data is stored in the file 'poep.out', don't ask me why :)

       To interpret the data, use the program 'poepp' and any Visualizer you
       want, consult the poepp documentation.
