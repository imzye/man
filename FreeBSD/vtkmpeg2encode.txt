NAME
       vtkmpeg2encode - VTK MPEG encoder library


SYNOPSIS
       #include <mpeg2enc.h>

       -I/usr/local/include

       -L/usr/local/lib -lvtkMPEG2Encode



DESCRIPTION
       This is the VTK MPEG2 encoder library for the Visualization Tool Kit.

       vtkmpeg2encode has been removed from VTK due to patent issues with the
       MPEG format.

       For those who don't mind dealing with the issues related to patented
       code, vtkmpeg2encode is now available as a separate download. Go to
       http://www.vtk.org and click on the "Download" link and look for links
       to archives of the vtkmpeg2encode source tree. It is buildable with
       CMake. See the comments in vtkMPEG2Writer class documentation or in
       VTK's CMakeLists.txt near the VTK_USE_MPEG2_ENCODER option for more
       info.

       FreeBSD ports users can simply install the vtkmpeg2encode port and read
       the license terms.

       Those of you using vtkMPEG2Writer will have to build vtkmpeg2encode
       separately and link it in to VTK to keep using it... assuming the
       responsibility for using patented code properly yourselves. Otherwise,
       you will have to discontinue use of the vtkMPEG2Writer class.
