VM_PAGE_DONTNEED(9)    FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual   VM_PAGE_DONTNEED(9)

NAME
     vm_page_dontneed – indicate that a page is not needed anymore

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <vm/vm.h>
     #include <vm/vm_page.h>

     void
     vm_page_dontneed(vm_page_t m);

DESCRIPTION
     The vm_page_dontneed() function advises the VM system that the given page
     is no longer required.  If the page is already in the inactive queue or
     in the cache queue, this function does nothing; otherwise the page is
     deactivated.

     Note that vm_page_dontneed() does not necessarily deactivate a page, but
     instead implements an algorithm that attempts to prevent small objects
     from having their pages reused too quickly, and large objects from
     flushing smaller ones from the queues as their pages are released.
