PTHREAD_SETSPECIFIC(3)                        FreeBSD Library Functions Manual

NAME
     pthread_setspecific – set a thread-specific data value

LIBRARY
     POSIX Threads Library (libpthread, -lpthread)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <pthread.h>

     int
     pthread_setspecific(pthread_key_t key, const void *value);

DESCRIPTION
     The pthread_setspecific() function associates a thread-specific value
     with a key obtained via a previous call to pthread_key_create().
     Different threads can bind different values to the same key.  These
     values are typically pointers to blocks of dynamically allocated memory
     that have been reserved for use by the calling thread.

     The effect of calling pthread_setspecific() with a key value not obtained
     from pthread_key_create() or after key has been deleted with
     pthread_key_delete() is undefined.

     The pthread_setspecific() function may be called from a thread-specific
     data destructor function, however this may result in lost storage or
     infinite loops if doing so causes non-NULL key values to remain after
     [PTHREAD_DESTRUCTOR_ITERATIONS] iterations of destructor calls have been
     made.

RETURN VALUES
     If successful, the pthread_setspecific() function will return zero.
     Otherwise an error number will be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     The pthread_setspecific() function will fail if:

     [ENOMEM]           Insufficient memory exists to associate the value with
                        the key.

     [EINVAL]           The key value is invalid.

SEE ALSO
     pthread_getspecific(3), pthread_key_create(3), pthread_key_delete(3)

STANDARDS
     The pthread_setspecific() function conforms to ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996
     (“POSIX.1”).
