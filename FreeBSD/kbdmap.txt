KBDMAP(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              KBDMAP(1)

NAME
     kbdmap, vidfont – front end for syscons and vt

SYNOPSIS
     kbdmap [-K] [-V] [-d | -default] [-h | -help] [-l | -lang language]
            [-p | -print] [-r | -restore] [-s | -show] [-v | -verbose]

DESCRIPTION
     The kbdmap utility allows easy setting of available keymaps.  The vidfont
     command allows the setting of fonts.  Both examine a database for the
     keymaps and fonts.  Descriptions are in English by default, but may also
     be in other languages.  These programs are interactive and expect to run
     in a terminal to get required input (e.g., a keymap selection) from the
     user.

     It is strongly recommended to not choose MSDOS codepage keymaps or fonts.
     Use the ISO standard version if available!  X11 does not support MSDOS
     codepage.

     The following options are available:

     -K      Run as command kbdmap.

     -V      Run as command vidfont.

     -d, -default
             Use default language.  Ignore LANG environment variable.

     -h, -help
             Print options and exit.

     -l, -lang language
             Use language for description and menu.

     -p, -print
             Print description of available keymaps or fonts to stdout and
             exit.

     -r, -restore
             Load default font from /etc/rc.conf.

     -s, -show
             Show currently supported languages and exit.

     -v, -verbose
             More warnings.

HISTORY
     The kbdmap and vidfont commands appeared in FreeBSD 2.1.

AUTHORS

     The current version was rewritten in C by Jonathan Belson
     <jon@witchspace.com> for FreeBSD 5.0.

BUGS
     The kbdmap and vidfont utilities work only on a (virtual) console and not
     with X11.
