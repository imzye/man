Alfio(8)                FreeBSD System Manager's Manual               Alfio(8)



NAME
       Alfio - an rc service for managing services at boot time through
       profiles.

DESCRIPTION
       Alfio is an rc service for managing services at boot time. It is
       specifically designed for FreeBSD, but it might work on any other
       system using rc.

       To check that Alfio works properly, run service -e and check that Alfio
       is the first service to run, or at least that it is the first service
       to run after the filesystem where Alfio is installed is mounted. If it
       is not, manually modify the BEFORE: line of the script to fix it
       (unless your system really needs to run some service before Alfio).

       Then you need to configure Alfio properly. This is done by putting into
       your /etc/rc.conf file all the configurations that is common to all
       profiles you want to set.

       Warning: you must not use the /etc/rc.d directory to configure your
       services: Alfio will replace this directory by a soft link to your
       Alfio profile. If you want to use rc.d for some configuration common to
       all Alfio profiles, then you will need to repeat it for each Alfio
       profile as described later. However, the lines needed to mount the
       filesystem where Alfio is installed must still be present into
       /etc/rc.conf.

       Create the directory /usr/local/etc/alfio and create a directory for
       each Alfio profile you need, named as you would like to see it listed
       in the Alfio menu when system starts. Put in there all the files you
       need as you would do with the /etc/rc.conf.d directory, excluding what
       you already put in /etc/rc.conf.

       Finally, configure the Alfio service itself: put in your /etc/rc.conf
       the following lines:

              alfio_enable="yes"
              alfio_profiles=<list of profiles you want to enable, named as
              their corresponding directory in /usr/local/etc/alfio, in the
              same order you want them to be listed at boot time>

       If alfio_profiles is not defined it will assume a default profile
       exists and will search for it in /usr/local/etc/alfio. If the directory
       does not exist, Alfio will report an error and will try last used Alfio
       profile (i.e. it will not touch /etc/rc.conf.d).
       You can optionally define the following variable:

              alfio_timeout=<time to wait before activating profile number 1
              by default, in the same syntax used by timeout>

       If not defined alfio_timeout defaults to 5 seconds.
