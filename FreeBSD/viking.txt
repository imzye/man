DESCRIPTION
       Viking is a program to manage GPS data.

       You can import and plot tracks, routes and waypoints, show
       OpenStreetMap (OSM) and/or other maps, generate maps (using Mapnik),
       geotag images, add coordinate lines, make new tracks, routes and
       waypoints, hide different things, etc. It is written mainly in C with
       some C++ and uses the GTK+ 3 toolkit. It is available for Linux, other
       POSIX operating systems and Windows.

OPTIONS
       file
           Specify file(s) to load at start.

           If a filename is in the 'geo' URI sheme (RFC5870[1]) then the
           positional information will be used (and it will not attempt to
           load it as a file)

       -
           Read input from standard in.

       -d, --debug
           Enable debug output.

       -V, --verbose
           Enable verbose output.

       -?, --help
           Show help options.

       -v, --version
           Show version.

       --latitude
           Set the initial position to the specified latitude in decimal
           degrees.

       --longitude
           Set the initial position to the specified longitude in decimal
           degrees.

       -z, --zoom
           Set the initial zoom level. The value is the OSM zoom level (0 -
           22).

       -m, --map
           Add a map layer by specifying the map id. The value needs to match
           one of the internal ids or an id from the maps configuration
           extension (see below). Specifying a value of 0 will use the map
           layer default.

               Internal Map Ids:

               OSM Mapnik = 13

               OSM Cycle = 17

               OSM Transport = 20

               OSM Humanitarian = 22

       -e, --external
           Load all specified GPX files in 'external' mode.

           This is in contrast to importing the data and storing it in the
           Viking file.

EXTENDING VIKING
       Currently, viking has some extension points based on configuration
       files. The file format is heavily inspired by the GtkBuilder file
       format: you specify the class of the GObject to build and set its
       properties. Technically, it is a XML file containing a "objects" root
       element. Inside this element, you set a collection of "object".

       Here is an example:

           <objects>
             <object class="ClassName">
               <property name="property_name1">Property value</property>
               <property name="property_name2">Property value</property>
             </object>
             ...
           <objects>


       You can find more examples in the documentation part of the
       distribution.

       The User Configuration File Location directory is ~/.viking for
       versions up to v1.8. For new installs from v1.9 onwards it is
       ~/.config/viking If the legacy location exists then Viking will use
       that in preference to the new location.

       Map Source. It is possible to add new map sources. The file is maps.xml
       in User Configuration File Location directory.  An example of the file
       in the distribution doc/examples/maps.xml.  The VikSlippyMapSource
       allows declaration of any map source working like OpenStreetMap. It
       supports the following properties:

       id
           this is an integer and should be unique as it used to identify the
           map source

       name
           a string (should be unique) that is used for the OSM style cache
           directory name when the Map Cache directory is the default (up to
           v1.8 ~/.viking-maps or v1.9 onwards~/.cache/viking)

       label
           the text displayed in the map's source selection dialog

       hostname
           the server's hostname (eg. "tile.openstreetmap.org")

       url
           the parametrized address of the tile, in the spirit of C printf
           format, with 3 "%d" fields for Z, X and Y (in that order) (eg.
           "/%d/%d/%d.png")

               Note
               The full parametrized address can just be put in the URL field
               and the hostname field doesn't need specifying.

               e.g. "https://tile.openstreetmap.org/%d/%d/%d.png"

       custom-http-headers (optional)
           Custom HTTP headers to be added to the download request. The
           default is none.

           Multiple headers can be specified by separating each part with an
           '\n'.

           The header allows of substition of values of the positional Z, X
           and Y (in that order) values, as per the url option above. Using
           multiple and/or different ordered values can be acheived via
           printf() positional argument specifiers. For example:

           DNT: 1\nLine2: %d %d %d\nReordered: %3$d %1$d %2$d

       copyright (optional)
           The copyright of the map source.

       license (optional)
           The license of the map source.

       license-url (optional)
           The URL of the license of the map source.

       zoom-min (optional)
           The minimum zoom value supported by the tile server. The Default is
           0 if not specified.

       zoom-max (optional)
           The maximum zoom value supported by the tile server. The Default is
           18 if not specified.

           See Zoom Levels[2]

       lat-min (optional)
           The minimum latitude value in degrees supported by the tile server.
           The Default is -90 degrees if not specified.

       lat-max (optional)
           The maximum latitude value in degrees supported by the tile server.
           The Default is 90 degrees if not specified.

       lon-min (optional)
           The minimum longitude value in degrees supported by the tile
           server. The Default is -180 degrees if not specified.

       lon-max (optional)
           The maximum longitude value in degrees supported by the tile
           server. The Default is 180 degrees if not specified.

       file-extension (optional)
           The file extension of the files on disk. The default is .png

           If the tile source URL ends in something other than .png, then this
           parameter will need to match it.

           This can also be useful in reading a tileset from other software
           which may name tiles in an alternative form, e.g. for Mobile Atlas
           creator it names them .png.tile

               Note
               The file types actually usable are those supported by GDK
               Pixbuf Library, which includes at least PNG and JPEG.

               Note
               Remember to include the beginning '.' when specifying this
               parameter.

       offset-x (optional)
           The offset of the map in the x plane (towards east) in metres. The
           default is 0.0 if not specified.

           Use negative numbers to adjust in a westerly direction.

           Typical usage would be aligning differing maps, e.g. aerial imagery
           may be offset from cadastral maps.

           Currently this is a single value that applies to all zoom levels.

       offset-y (optional)
           The offset of the map in the y plane (towards north) in metres. The
           default is 0.0 if not specified.

           Use negative numbers to adjust in a southerly direction.

       switch-xy (optional)
           Swap the X,Y values around in the URL parametrized ordering.

           The default is false.

       check-file-server-time (optional)
           Sends the timestamp of the tile to the server, so the server can
           decide whether it should send a new tile or not.

           The default is false.

       use-etag (optional)
           Use and compare the ETag[3] value in determining whether to
           download a newer tile. The default is false.

           The ETag value is stored in a separate file in the same directory
           as the tile to enable checking the value across multiple runs of
           the program.

       referer (optional)
           A URL to serve as referer for the HTTP request (eg.
           "http://hostname/")

       follow-location (optional)
           The maximum number of redirects allowed. The default is 0, i.e. no
           redirection. Use -1 for an unlimited number of redirects.

       tilesize-x (optional)
           The tile x size. The default is 256 pixels if not specified.

       tilesize-y (optional)
           The tile y size. The default is 256 pixels if not specified.

       scale (optional)
           The tile scale. The scale is 1 if not specified.

               Note
               Use a value of 2 to represent high res tiles. Don't change the
               tilesize as the internal display size is still based on 256
               pixels.

       The VikTmsMapSource allows declaration of any TMS service. A TMS (Tile
       Map Service) is defined in OSGeo wiki[4]. The configuration supports
       the following properties (as per VikSlippyMapSource above):
           id
           label

       The VikWmscMapSource allows declaration of any WMS or WMS-C service. A
       WMS (Web Map Service) is defined in WMS Tile Caching[5]. The
       configuration supports the following properties (as per
       VikSlippyMapSource above):
           id
           label
           hostname
           url
           custom-http-headers (optional)

           tilesize-y (optional)
           offset-x (optional)
           offset-y (optional)

       Go-to search engines. It is possible to add new new search engines for
       the "Go-To" feature. The file is goto_tools.xml in User Configuration
       File Location directory.  An example of the file in the distribution
       doc/examples/goto_tools.xml.  Currently, there is a single object class
       available: VikGotoXmlTool. This feature allows one to declare any
       search engine using a XML format as result.  The related properties
       are:

       label
           the text displayed in the Go-To dialog

       url-format
           the parametrized address of the query, in the spirit of C printf
           format, with a single "%s" field (replaced by the query string)

       lat-path
           XML path of the latitude (eg.  /root/parent/elem)

       lat-attr (optional)
           name of the attribute (of previous element) containing the latitude

       lon-path
           XML path of the longitude (eg.  /root/parent/elem)

       lon-attr (optional)
           name of the attribute (of previous element) containing the longiude
       As a facility (or readability) it is possible to set both path and
       attribute name in a single property, like an XPath expression. To do
       so, simply set both info in lat-path (or lon-path) in the following
       format: /root/parent/elem@attribute.

       External tools. It is possible to add new external tools. The file is
       external_tools.xml in User Configuration File Location directory.  An
       example of the file in the distribution
       doc/examples/external_tools.xml.  The VikWebtoolCenter allows one to
       declare any Webtool using a logic based on center coordinates and zoom
       level value.  The related properties are:

       label
           the text displayed in the menu entry

       url
           the parametrized URL to open, in the spirit of C printf format,
           with 2 "%s" and a "%d" fields for X, Y and Z (zoom level) (eg.
           "http://hostname/?lat=%s&lon=%s&zoom=%d")
       The VikWebtoolBounds allows one to declare any Webtool using a logic
       based on bounds coordinates.  The related properties are:

       label
           the text displayed in the menu entry

       url
           the parametrized address of the tile, in the spirit of C printf
           format, with 4 "%s" fields for left, right, bottom and top (eg.
           "http://hostname:8111/load_and_zoom?left=%s&right=%s&bottom=%s&top=%s")

       Routing engine. It is possible to declare new routing engines. The file
       is routing.xml in User Configuration File Location directory.  An
       example of the file in the distribution doc/examples/routing.xml.  The
       VikRoutingWebEngine allows one to declare a routing engine available
       via HTTP.  The related properties are:

       id
           a string, should be unique as it used to identify the routing
           engine

       label
           the text displayed in the menu entry

       format
           The GPSBabel format code to interpret the service response. By
           default a GPX response is expected and processed internally.
           However if the service returns different format then GPSBabel is
           used to transform the text into something that Viking can
           understand. Only formats that GPSBabel supports can be used: e.g.
           'gpx', 'kml', 'gtrnctr' (for Garmin Training Center .tcx files),
           etc...

           Use gpsbabel --help on the command line to find out the supported
           file types and their codes to process them.

       url-base
           the base URL of the web service (eg. "http://hostname/service?")

       url-start-ll
           the part of the URL setting the starting point location,
           parametrized in the spirit of C printf format, with 2 "%s" for
           coordinates (eg. "&start=%s,%s")

       url-stop-ll
           the part of the URL setting the end point location, parametrized in
           the spirit of C printf format, with 2 "%s" for coordinates (eg.
           "&stop=%s,%s")

       url-via-ll (optional)
           the part of the URL setting via point location, parametrized in the
           spirit of C printf format, with 2 "%s" for coordinates (eg.
           "&via=%s,%s")

       url-start-dir (optional)
           the part of the URL setting the starting point location for
           direction based routing, parametrized in the spirit of C printf
           format, with one "%s" for direction (eg. "&start=%s")

       url-stop-dir (optional)
           the part of the URL setting the end point location for direction
           based routing, parametrized in the spirit of C printf format, with
           one "%s" for direction (eg. "&start=%s")

       url-ll-lat-first (optional)
           The ordering of the lat/long terms in the Start, Stop and Via URL
           settings. By default this is TRUE.

           For instance using Brouter services, the URL uses a pair of values
           which is longitude and then latitude. Thus setting this value to
           FALSE ensures the value substitution is performed in the necessary
           order.

       referer (optional)
           A URL to serve as referer for the HTTP request (eg.
           "http://hostname/")

       follow-location (optional)
           The maximum number of redirects allowed. The default is 0, i.e. no
           redirection. Use -1 for an unlimited number of redirects.

       Remote File Datasources. It is possible to add web references expected
       to return a file which can then be opened directly or converted via
       GPSBabel.  The file is datasources.xml in your User Configuration File
       Location directory.  An example of the file is in the source
       distribution doc/examples/datasources.xml.  The VikWebtoolDatasource
       allows one to declare any URL using logic based on coordinates.  The
       related properties are:

       label
           the text displayed in the menu entry

       url
           the parametrized URL to open in the spirit of C printf format, with
           up to 7 "%s" values. e.g.  http://hostname/getfile?lat=%s&lon=%s

           The order and meaning of these parameters is given by the
           url_format_code below

       url_format_code
           A string describing the parametrized URL substitution parameters,
           each character represents how to translate each term.

           B = Bottom of the current view i.e. minimum latitude

           L = Left of the current view i.e. minimum longitude

           T = Top of the current view i.e. maximum latitude

           R = Right of the current view i.e. maximum longitude

           A = center lAtitude of the current view

           O = center lOngitude of the current view

           Z = OSM Zoom value of the current view. See Zoom Levels[2]

           S = A user specified input string requested from the user via a
           dialog box

           Thus for the url example above then the format code should be AO

       file_type
           This value is passed on for the -i parameter in interfacing with
           GPSBabel.

           If it is not defined then the returned file is interpreted
           internally as a GPX file.

           Possible values such as 'kml', 'mapsource' etc.. can be used. See
           GPSBabel File Formats[6] for the full list.

       babel_filter_args
           This value is passed on for the filter arguments interfacing with
           GPSBabel.

           E.g. "-x nuketypes,routes" can be used to filter all routes from
           the results.

       input_label
           This value is used when requesting input from the user.

           It is the label of the text input box.

FILES
       The User Configuration File Location directory is ~/.viking for
       versions up to v1.8. For new installs it is ~/.config/viking from v1.9
       onwards. If the legacy location exists then Viking will use that in
       preference to the new location.

           Default location of the map cache of tiles downloaded or created by
           viking.

           If the legacy location exists then Viking will use that in
           preference.

       Extension files (maps.xml, goto_tools.xml, datasources.xml,
       external_tools.xml, routing.xml) are also searched in /etc/viking and
       /usr/share/viking directories (or related in your system).

           (maps.xml, goto_tools.xml, datasources.xml, external_tools.xml,
           routing.xml).
