Spreadsheet::GenerateXLSX(3)               User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Spreadsheet::GenerateXLSX - function to generate XLSX spreadsheet from
       array ref(s)

SYNOPSIS
        use Spreadsheet::GenerateXLSX qw/ generate_xlsx /;

        my @data = (
                    ['Heading 1', 'Heading 2', 'Heading 2'],
                    ['blah',      'blah',      'blah'],
                    ['blah',      'blah',      'blah'],
                   );
        generate_xlsx('example.xlsx', \@data);

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a function "generate_xlsx" which takes an array of
       Perl data and generates a simple Excel spreadsheet in the XLSX format.
       The generated sheets have the first row frozen, and auto filters
       enabled for every column.

       Each sheet in the spreadsheet is generated from an array of rows, where
       each row is an arrayref.  The first row is treated as a header row.
       Here's an example:

        my @sheet1 = (
           ['Pokemon',  'Type',      'Number'],
           ['Pikachu',  'Electric',  25],
           ['Vulpix',   'Fire',      37],
           ['Ditto',    'Normal',    132],
        );

       The generated spreadsheet can have any numbers of sheets:

        generate_xslx('pokemon.xlsx', \@sheet1, \@sheet2);

       If you just pass arrayrefs, the sheets will be named Sheet1, Sheet2,
       etc.  You can also pass the name of the sheet:

        generate_xslx('pokemon.xlsx', 'All Pokemon' => \@sheet1, 'Hit List' => \@sheet2);

SEE ALSO
       The following modules can all generate the XLSX format.  I also wrote a
       blog post <http://neilb.org/2016/12/10/spreadsheet-generate-xlsx.html>
       which gives more details on some of these.

           Excel::Writer::XLSX - the underlying module used to generate the
           spreadsheet.  Gives you full control over the spreadsheet
           generated, but as a result has a much more complex interface.

           Spreadsheet::WriteExcel::Styler - helps with formatting of cells
           when using "Excel::Writer::XLSX" or "Spreadsheet::WriteExcel".

           Spreadsheet::Template - used to generate spreadsheets from "JSON
           files which describe the desired content and formatting".  By
           default it generates XLSX format.

           Data::Table::Excel - converts between Data::Table objects and XLS
           or XLSX format spreadsheets.

           XLS::Simple - provides a simple interface for both reading and
           writing spreadsheets.  Minimal documentation, and what there is is
           written in Japanese.  The function for creating a spreadsheet is
           called `write_xls()`, but it generates the XLSX format.

       The following modules only generate Microsoft's earlier xls binary
       format.

           Spreadsheet::WriteExcel - provides the same interface as
           "Excel::Writer::XLSX", but generates the XLS format.

           Spreadsheet::WriteExcel::FromDB - converts a database table to an
           XLS format spreadsheet.

           Spreadsheet::WriteExcel::FromDB::Query - converts a query to an XLS
           spreadsheet, as opposed to a table.

           Spreadsheet::WriteExcel::Simple - provides a simpler OO interface
           for generating single-sheet XLS spreadsheets.

           Spreadsheet::Write - another simplified OO interface, which can
           write CSV or XLS output, but not XLSX.

           Spreadsheet::Wright - a fork of "Spreadsheet::Write" which supports
           more output formats (CSV, XLS, HTML, XHTML, XML, ODS, and JSON),
           but doesn't (appear to) support XLSX.

           Spreadsheet::DataToExcel - provides a simple OO interface for
           generating XLS spreadsheets, and provides some control over the
           generated format.  But, as with most of the modules listed here,
           only XLS output is supported.

           Spreadsheet::WriteExcel::Simple::Tabs - a very simple OO interface
           built on "Spreadsheet::WriteExcel".  This one is close to the
           spirit of "Spreadsheet::GenerateXLSX", but only generates XLS.

TODO
        * smarter auto-formatting of columns
        * more tests
        * better error handler
