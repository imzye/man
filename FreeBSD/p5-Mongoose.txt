NAME
       Mongoose - MongoDB document to Moose object mapper

SYNOPSIS
           package Person;
           use Moose;
           with 'Mongoose::Document';
           has 'name' => ( is => 'rw', isa => 'Str' );

           package main;
           use Mongoose;

           Mongoose->db('mydb');

           my $person = Person->new( name => 'Jack' );
           $person->save;

           $person = Person->find_one({ name => 'Jack' });
           say $person->name; # Jack

           Person->find({ name => qr/^J/' })->each(sub{
               say "Found ", $person->name;
           });

           $person->delete;

DESCRIPTION
       This is a MongoDB to Moose object mapper. This module allows you to use
       the full power of MongoDB within your Moose classes, without
       sacrificing MongoDB's power, flexibility and speed.

       It's loosely inspired by Ruby's MongoMapper, which is in turn loosely
       based on the ActiveRecord pattern.

       Start by reading the introduction Mongoose::Intro.

       Or proceed directly to the Mongoose::Cookbook for many day-to-day
       recipes.

WARNING
       Since version 2.00 Mongoose only support the new MongoDB driver v2.x.x
       which it's now required.

       Please let me know if you find anything strange using this new driver.

METHODS
   db
       Sets the current MongoDB connection and/or db name.

           Mongoose->db( 'mydb' );

       The connection defaults to whatever MongoDB defaults are (typically
       localhost:27017).

       For more control over the connection, "db" takes the same parameters as
       MongoDB::MongoClient.

           my $db = Mongoose->db(
               host           => 'mongodb://somehost:27017',
               read_pref_mode => 'secondaryPreferred',
               db_name        => 'mydb',
               username       => 'myuser',
               password       => 'mypass',
               ssl            => 1
           );

       This will, in turn, instantiate a MongoDB::MongoClient and return a
       MongoDB::Database object for "mydb".

       Important: Mongoose will always defer connecting to Mongo until the
       last possible moment. This is done to prevent using the MongoDB driver
       in a forked environment (ie. with a prefork appserver like Starman,
       Hypnotoad or Catalyst's HTTP::Prefork).

       If you prefer to connect while setting the connection string, use one
       of these options:

           Mongoose->db( db_name=>'mydb', -now=>1 );  # connect now

           # or by wating for a return value

           my $db = Mongoose->db( 'mydb' );

           # or explicitly:

           Mongoose->db( 'mydb' );
           Mongoose->connect;

       You can separate your classes storage on multiple hosts/databases by
       calling db() several times:

           # Default host/database (connect now!)
           my $db = Mongoose->db( 'mydb' );

           # Other database for some class (defer connection)
           Mongoose->db( db_name => 'my_other_db', class => 'Log' );

           # Other database on other host for several classes
           Mongoose->db(
               db_name => 'my_remote_db',
               host    => 'mongodb://192.168.1.23:27017',
               class   => [qw/ Author Post /]
           );

   connect
       Connects to Mongo using the connection arguments passed to the "db"
       method.

   load_schema
       Uses Module::Pluggable to "require" all modules under a given search
       path or search dir.

       All arguments will be sent to Module::Pluggable's "import", except for
       Mongoose specific ones.

           package main;
           use Mongoose;

           # to load a schema from a namespace path:
           Mongoose->load_schema( search_path=>'MyApp::Schema' );

       This method can be used to shorten class names, aliasing them for
       convenience if you wish:

           Mongoose->load_schema( search_path=>'MyApp::Schema', shorten=>1 );

       Will shorten the module name to it's last bit:

           MyApp::Schema::Author->new( ... );

           # becomes

           Author->new( ... );

   connection
       Sets/returns the current connection object, of class
       MongoDB::MongoClient.

       Defaults to whatever MongoDB defaults.

   disconnect
       Unsets the Mongoose connection handler.

   class_config
       Keep track of document classes config solving aliasing indirection.

   aliased
       Keep track of aliasing classes. Useful to retrieve full document class
       from a shortened one.

COLLECTION NAMING
       By default, Mongoose composes the Mongo collection name from your
       package name by replacing double-colon "::" with underscores "_",
       separating camel-case, such as "aB" with "a_b" and uppercase with
       lowercase letters.

       This behaviour can be changed by choosing other named method or by
       setting the collection naming routine with a "closure" as exlained in
       Mongoose::Role::Naming.

BUGS
       This is a WIP, now *beta* quality software.

       Report bugs via Github Issue reporting
       <https://github.com/rodrigolive/mongoose/issues>.  Test cases highly
       desired and appreciated.

TODO
       * Better error control

       * Finish-up multiple database support

       * Allow query->fields to control which fields get expanded into the
       object.

       * Cleanup internals.

       * More tests and use cases.

       * Better documentation.
