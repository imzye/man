NAME
       meta - A simple front-end to Acme::MetaSyntactic

SYNOPSIS
       meta [ --whitespace|ws ] [ --help ] [ --version ] [ --remote ] [
       --check ] [ --sources ] [ --category category ]  theme[/category] [
       count ]

DESCRIPTION
       meta is a simple front-end to Acme::MetaSyntactic.

       A few examples should make it easy to understand what it does and how
       it works:

           $ meta
           baz
           $ meta batman
           powie
           $ meta donmartin 3
           kloong
           thoof_foing
           weeooweeeoooo
           $ meta -ws browser 4
           arachne netscape voyager w3m

       In short, the default theme is "foo", the default count is 1, the
       default separator is $/, but you can replace it by whitespace with
       --ws.

COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
       The following command-line options are available:

   Metasyntactic options
       --whitespace, --ws
           Print all items on a single line, separated by space.

       --remote
           Fetch the remote list (if available) and print it.

       --check
           Fetch the remote list (if available) and print only the differences
           betwen the current list and the remote list (items are prefixed by
           "+" and "-").

           Option added by Abigail.

           The output of this option is affected by the --whitespace option.

       --category category
           Only select items in the given category (for
           "Acme::MetaSyntactic::MultiList" subclasses). If not given, use the
           default category.

           Silently fallbacks to the default if the category doesn't exist.

           Another way to ask for a specific category is to skip the
           --category option and directly ask for "theme/category". Note that
           you cannot use both calling conventions simultaneously.

   Informative options
       The program will exit if any of these options is selected.  However,
       these options can be combined.

       --themes
           Print the list of available themes.

       --sources
           Print the URLs used by a remote list.

       --version
           Print version information.

       --help
           Print a short help message.

SUCCESS STORIES
       meta is the script of choice for a new generation of hackers.  Here are
       a few comments from satisfied users:

       •   "Acme::MetaSyntactic" makes me more productive when I have to write
           regression tests for my Perl modules. No more do I spend time
           looking for variable names! It simply changed my life.

           -- Rafael Garcia-Suarez, pumpking, used AMS when writing tests for
           "Sub::Identify".

       •   "Acme::MetaSyntactic" gave names for regression tests in the Perl
           core

           See
           <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/commit/adc51b978ed1b2e9d4512c9bfa80386ac917d05a>.

       •   Your module has been a wonderful timesaver for me. How much time I
           used to spend on thinking about good and meaningful variable names,
           and now I have them at the snap of a finger!

           -- Gisbert W. Selke

       •   [...] with the help of Acme::MetaSyntatic I've been able to do some
           rudimentary code generation techniques that save me a lot of time
           without much outlay.

           -- Mark Fowler

           <http://blog.twoshortplanks.com/2010/07/03/holy_acceleration/>

       •   When writing example applications, I almost always use variable
           names such as foo and bar. This gets boring, and it easily confuse
           the reader. Especially when I need to use more variables.

EXAMPLES OF USE
       Ever needed to debug with the help of a few print() statements?  Simply
       map some keystrokes to insert a warning where you want it.  With meta,
       you will never need to think about what write in the string argument:

           nmap _wa :r!meta donmartin<CR>iwarn"<Esc>A";<Esc>==

       (This mapping kindly given by Rafael Garcia-Suarez.)
