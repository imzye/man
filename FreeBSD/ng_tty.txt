NG_TTY(4)              FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual              NG_TTY(4)

NAME
     ng_tty – netgraph node type that is also a TTY hook

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/ttycom.h>
     #include <netgraph/ng_tty.h>

DESCRIPTION
     The tty node type is both a netgraph node type and a TTY hook.

     The node has a single hook called hook.  Incoming bytes received on the
     tty device are sent out on this hook, and frames received on hook are
     transmitted out on the tty device.  No modification to the data is
     performed in either direction.  While the hook is installed on a tty, the
     normal read and write operations are unavailable, returning EIO.

     Incoming data is delivered directly to ng_tty via the tty bypass hook as
     a buffer pointer and length, this is converted to a mbuf and passed to
     the peer.

     The node supports an optional “hot character”.  If the driver can not
     deliver data directly to the tty bypass hook then each character is input
     one at a time.  If set to non-zero and bypass mode is unavailable,
     incoming data from the tty device is queued until this character is seen.
     This avoids sending lots of mbufs containing a small number of bytes, but
     introduces potentially infinite latency.  The default hot character is
     0x7e, consistent with hook being connected to a ng_async(4) type node.
     The hot character has no effect on the transmission of data.

HOOKS
     This node type supports the following hooks:

     hook      tty(4) serial data contained in mbuf structures, with arbitrary
               inter-frame boundaries.

CONTROL MESSAGES
     This node type supports the generic control messages, plus the following:

     NGM_TTY_SET_HOTCHAR
          This command takes an integer argument and sets the hot character
          from the lower 8 bits.  A hot character of zero disables queueing,
          so that all received data is forwarded immediately.

     NGM_TTY_GET_HOTCHAR
          Returns an integer containing the current hot character in the lower
          eight bits.

     NGM_TTY_SET_TTY
          This command takes integer process ID and file descriptor of open
          tty and registers the tty hooks.

SHUTDOWN
     This node shuts down when the corresponding device is closed.

BUGS
     The serial driver code also has a notion of a “hot character”.
     Unfortunately, this value is statically defined in terms of the line
     discipline and cannot be changed.  Therefore, if a hot character other
     than 0x7e (the default) is set for the ng_tty node, the node has no way
     to convey this information to the serial driver, and sub-optimal
     performance may result.
