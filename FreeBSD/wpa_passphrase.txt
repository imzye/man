NAME
     wpa_passphrase – utility for generating a 256-bit pre-shared WPA key from
     an ASCII passphrase

SYNOPSIS
     wpa_passphrase ⟨ssid⟩ [passphrase]

DESCRIPTION
     The wpa_passphrase utility is a small program for generating a 256-bit
     pre-shared WPA key from an ASCII passphrase and a given SSID. The output
     is formatted for inclusion in wpa_supplicant.conf(5).

     If wpa_passphrase is called with only an SSID as argument it will prompt
     for a passphrase on standard input.
