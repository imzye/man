NAME
       fig2ps - conversion of xfig pictures to postscript

SYNOPSIS
       fig2ps input.fig output.ps

INTRODUCTION
       The fig2ps script converts the input figure input.fig (which is
       designed using the xfig program) into a postscript file output.ps. The
       advantage of using this script resides in the fact that special
       TeX/LaTeX text inside the figure is processed; this is not the case if
       you use the usual save under postscript option inside xfig.
