ACKINFO.CGI(1)          FreeBSD General Commands Manual         ACKINFO.CGI(1)

NAME
       ackinfo.cgi - Xymon CGI script to acknowledge alerts

SYNOPSIS
       ackinfo.cgi


DESCRIPTION
       ackinfo.cgi is invoked as a CGI script via the ackinfo.sh CGI wrapper.

       ackinfo.cgi is used to acknowledge an alert on the Xymon "Critical
       Systems" view, generated by the criticalview.cgi(1) utility. This
       allows the staff viewing the Critical Systems view to acknowledge
       alerts with a "Level 1" alert, thereby removing the alert from the
       Critical Systems view.

       Note that the Level 1 alert generated by the ackinfo.cgi utility does
       NOT stop alerts from being sent.

       In a future version of Xymon (after Xymon 4.2), this utility will also
       be used for acknowledging alerts at other levels.


OPTIONS
       --level=NUMBER
              Sets the acknowledgment level. This is typically used to force a
              specific level of the acknowledgment, e.g. a level 1 acknowledge
              when called from the Critical Systems view.


       --validity=TIME
              Sets the validity of the acknowledgment. By default this is
              taken from the CGI parameters supplied by the user.


       --sender=STRING
              Logs STRING as the sender of the acknowledgment. By default,
              this is taken from the loginname of the webuser sending the
              acknowledgment.


       --env=FILENAME
              Loads the environment defined in FILENAME before executing the
              CGI script.


       --area=NAME
              Load environment variables for a specific area. NB: if used,
              this option must appear before any --env=FILENAME option.


       --debug
              Enables debugging output.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       XYMONHOME
              Used to locate the template files for the generated web pages.


       QUERY_STRING
              Contains the parameters for the CGI script.
