SYNOPSIS
     #include <krb5.h>

     PA_DATA *
     krb5_find_padata(PA_DATA *val, unsigned len, int type, int *index);

     int
     krb5_padata_add(krb5_context context, METHOD_DATA *md, int type,
         void *buf, size_t len);

DESCRIPTION
     krb5_find_padata() tries to find the pre-authentication data entry of
     type type in the array val of length len.  The search is started at entry
     pointed out by *index (zero based indexing).  If the type isn't found,
     NULL is returned.

     krb5_padata_add() adds a pre-authentication data entry of type type
     pointed out by buf and len to md.
