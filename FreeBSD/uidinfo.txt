UIDINFO(9)             FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual            UIDINFO(9)

NAME
     uidinfo, uihashinit, uifind, uihold, uifree – functions for managing UID
     information

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <sys/proc.h>
     #include <sys/resourcevar.h>

     void
     uihashinit(void);

     struct uidinfo *
     uifind(uid_t uid);

     void
     uihold(struct uidinfo *uip);

     void
     uifree(struct uidinfo *uip);

DESCRIPTION
     The uidinfo family of functions is used to manage uidinfo structures.
     Each uidinfo structure maintains per uid resource consumption counts,
     including the process count and socket buffer space usage.

     The uihashinit() function initializes the uidinfo hash table and its
     mutex.  This function should only be called during system initialization.

     The uifind() function looks up and returns the uidinfo structure for uid.
     If no uidinfo structure exists for uid, a new structure will be allocated
     and initialized.  The uidinfo hash mutex is acquired and released.

     The uihold() function increases the reference count on uip.  uip's lock
     is acquired and released.

     The uifree() function decreases the reference count on uip, and if the
     count reaches 0 uip is freed.  uip's lock is acquired and release and the
     uidinfo hash mutex may be acquired and released.

RETURN VALUES
     uifind() returns a pointer to an initialized uidinfo structure, and
     should not fail.
