DISC(4)                FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                DISC(4)

NAME
     disc – software discard network interface

SYNOPSIS
     device disc

DESCRIPTION
     The disc interface is a software discard mechanism which may be used for
     performance analysis and/or software testing.  As with other network
     interfaces, the discard interface must have network addresses assigned
     for each address family with which it is to be used.  These addresses may
     be set or changed with the SIOCSIFADDR ioctl(2).

     Each disc interface is created at runtime using interface cloning.  This
     is most easily done with the ifconfig(8) create command or using the
     cloned_interfaces variable in rc.conf(5).

SEE ALSO
     inet(4), intro(4)

HISTORY
     The disc device appears to have been derived from the lo(4) device around
     the time of 4.4BSD.  This manpage was adapted from lo(4) and first
     appeared in FreeBSD 5.0.
