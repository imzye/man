NAME
       WWW::WebArchive - Retrieve old versions of public web pages from
       various web archives (i.e. www.archive.org, Internet Archive's Wayback
       Machine, or Google's page cache)

SYNOPSIS
           NOTE: You probably want to use the "webarchive" command line utility rather than
           this API.  If you really want to use the API, you should look at how "webarchive"
           uses it as an example.

           #!/usr/bin/perl

           use WWW::WebArchive;
           my $webarchive = WWW::WebArchive->new();
           $webarchive->restore( { url => "http://www.website.com" } );

DESCRIPTION
       WWW-WebArchive is a set of modules to retrieve old versions of public
       web pages from various web archives.

         * http://www.archive.org - Internet Archive's Wayback Machine
         * http://www.google.com  - Google's page cache

       This is useful if

        1. Your web server crashed and you didn't have complete backups
        2. A site (such as a valuable reference source) changed or went away
           and you want to restore an old version of the site to your local
           disk
