Term::Choose::LineFold::XS(3)              User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Term::Choose::LineFold::XS - XS acceleration for Term-Choose-LineFold

VERSION
       Version 0.002

DESCRIPTION
       Width in this context refers to the number of occupied columns of a
       character string on a terminal with a monospaced font.

       By default ambiguous width characters are treated as half width. If the
       environment variable "TC_AMBIGUOUS_WIDTH_IS_WIDE" is set to a true
       value, ambiguous width characters are treated as full width.

   Perl version
       Requires Perl version 5.16.0 or greater.

EXPORT
       Nothing by default.

           use Term::Choose::LineFold::XS qw( print_columns );

FUNCTIONS
   print_columns
       Get the number of occupied columns of a character string on a terminal.

       The string passed to this function is a decoded string, free of control
       characters, non-characters, and surrogates.

           $print_width = print_columns( $string );
