DWARF_TRANSFORM_TO_DISK_FORM(3)               FreeBSD Library Functions Manual

NAME
     dwarf_transform_to_disk_form – transform DWARF information into byte
     streams

LIBRARY
     DWARF Access Library (libdwarf, -ldwarf)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <libdwarf.h>

     Dwarf_Signed
     dwarf_transform_to_disk_form(Dwarf_P_Debug dbg, Dwarf_Error *err);

DESCRIPTION
     Function dwarf_transform_to_disk_form() transforms the DWARF information
     gathered by the producer into byte streams for the application to write
     out as ELF sections.  If the flag DW_DLC_SYMBOLIC_RELOCATIONS is set on
     the producer, the function will also generate the associated relocation
     arrays.

     Argument dbg should reference a DWARF producer instance allocated using
     dwarf_producer_init(3) or dwarf_producer_init_b(3).

     If argument err is not NULL, it will be used to store error information
     in case of an error.

     After a call to this function, the application can call the function
     dwarf_get_section_bytes(3) to retrieve the byte streams for each ELF
     section.  If the flag DW_DLC_SYMBOLIC_RELOCATIONS was set on the
     descriptor, the application can also call the function
     dwarf_get_relocation_info(3) to retrieve the generated relocation arrays.

RETURN VALUES
     On success, function dwarf_transform_to_disk_form() returns the total
     number of ELF sections generated.  In case of an error, function
     dwarf_transform_to_disk_form() returns DW_DLV_NOCOUNT and sets the
     argument err.

ERRORS
     Function dwarf_transform_to_disk_form() can fail with:

     [DW_DLE_ARGUMENT]       Argument dbg was NULL.

     [DW_DLE_MEMORY]         An out of memory condition was encountered during
                             execution.
