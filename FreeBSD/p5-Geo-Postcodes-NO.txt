Geo::Postcodes::NO(3)                      User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Geo::Postcodes::NO - Norwegian postcodes with associated information

SYNOPSIS
       This module can be used object oriented, or as procedures.  Take your
       pick.

   AS OBJECTS
        use Geo::Postcodes::NO;

        my $postcode = '1178'; # My postcode.

        if (Geo::Postcodes::NO::valid($postcode)) # A valid postcode?
        {
          my $P = Geo::Postcodes::NO->new($postcode);

          printf "Postcode         '%s'.\n", $P->postcode();
          printf "Postal location: '%s'.\n", $P->location();
          printf "Borough number:  '%s'.\n", $P->borough_number();
          printf "Borough:         '%s'.\n", $P->borough();
          printf "County:          '%s'.\n", $P->county();
          printf "Postcode type:   '%s'.\n", $P->type();
          printf "- in norwegian:  '%s'.\n", $P->type_verbose();
          printf "- in english:    '%s'.\n", $P->Geo::Postcodes::type_verbose();
        }

       The test for a valid postcode can also be done on the object itself, as
       it will be undef when passed an illegal postcode (and thus no object at
       all.)

        my $P = Geo::Postcodes::NO->new($postcode);

        if ($P) { ... }

       A more compact solution:

        if ($P = Geo::Postcodes::NO->new($postcode))
        {
          foreach my $field (Geo::Postcodes::NO::get_fields())
          {
            printf("%-20s %s\n", ucfirst($field), $P->$field())
          }
        }

       This will not show the english description of the type.

   AS PROCEDURES
        use Geo::Postcodes::NO;

        my $postcode = "1178";

        if (Geo::Postcodes::NO::valid($postcode))
        {
          printf "Postcode"        '%s'.\n", $postcode;
          printf "Postal location: '%s'.\n", location_of($postcode);
          printf "Borough number:  '%s'.\n", borough_number_of($postcode);
          printf "Borough:         '%s'.\n", borough_of($postcode);
          printf "County:          '%s'.\n", county_of($postcode);
          printf "Postcode type:   '%s'.\n", type_of($postcode);
          printf "Postcode type:   '%s'.\n", type_of($postcode);
          printf "- in norwegian:  '%s'.\n", type_of_verbose($postcode);
          printf "- in english:    '%s'.\n", Geo::Postcodes::type_of_verbose($postcode);
        }

ABSTRACT
       Geo::Postcodes::NO - Perl extension for the mapping between norwegian
       postal codes, postal locations, and the local administrative levels of
       boroughs (kommuner) and counties (fylker).

DESCRIPTION
       Tired of entering the postal location all the time? This is not
       necessary, as it is uniquely defined from the postcode. Request the
       postcode only, and use this library to get the postal name.

       The library can also tell you in which borough by name or number and
       county by name the postcode is located. The borough number can be
       handy, as it is used when reporting wages and tax to the Norwegian Tax
       Administration

       The module supports the following fields: 'postcode', 'location',
       'borough_number', 'borough', 'county', 'type', and 'type_verbose'. This
       list can also be obtained with the call
       Geo::Postcodes::NO::get_fields().

   EXPORT
       None.

DEPENDENCIES
       This module is a subclass of Geo::Postcodes, which must be installed
       first.

PROCEDURES and METHODS
       These functions can be used as methods or procedures.

   is_field
         my $boolean = Geo::postcodes::NO::is_field($field);
         my $boolean = $postcode_object->is_field($field);

       Does the specified field exist.

   get_fields
         my @fields = Geo::postcodes::NO::get_fields();
         my @fields = $postcode_object->get_fields();

       A list of legal fields.

   selection
       This procedure/method makes it possible to select more than one
       postcode at a time, based on arbitrary complex rules.

       See the selection documentation (perldoc Geo::Postcodes::Selection or
       man Geo::Postcodes::Selection) for a full description, and the tutorial
       (perldoc Geo::Postcodes::Tutorial or man Geo::Postcodes::Tutorial) for
       sample code.

   selection_loop
       As above.

PROCEDURES
       Note that the xxx_of procedures return undef when passed an illegal
       argument. They are used internally by the object constructor (new).

   legal
         my $boolean = Geo::Postcodes::NO::legal($postcode);

       Do we have a legal postcode; a code that follows the syntax rules?

   valid
         my $boolean = Geo::Postcodes::NO::valid($postcode);

       Do we have a valid postcode; a code in actual use?

   get_postcodes
       This will return an unsorted list of all the norwegian postcodes.

   verify_selectionlist
       This will check the list of arguments for correctness, and should be
       used before calling 'selection'. The procedure returns a modified
       version of the arguments on success, and diagnostic messages on
       failure.

         my($status, @modified) = Geo::Postcodes::NO::verify_selectionlist(@args);

         if ($status)
         {
           my @result = Geo::Postcodes::NO::selection(@modified);
         }
         else
         {
           print "Diagnostic messages:\n";
           map { print " - $_\n" } @modified;
         }

   postcode_of
         $postcode = Geo::Postcodes::NO::postcode_of($postcode);

       Used internally by 'selection', but otherwise not very useful.

   location_of
         my $loaction = Geo::Postcodes::NO::location_of($postcode);

       The postal location associated with the specified postcode.

   borough_number_of
         my $boroug_number = Geo::Postcodes::NO::borough_number_of($postcode);

       The number of the borough (kommune) where the postcode is located.

   borough_number2borough
        my $borough = Geo::Postcodes::NO::borough_number2borough($borough);

       The name of the borough (kommune) with the specified borough number.

   borough_of
        my $borough = Geo::Postcodes::NO::borough_of($postcode);

       The name of the borough (kommune) where the postcode is located.

   county_of
        my $county = Geo::Postcodes::NO::county_of($county_number);

       The name of the county (fylke) where the postcode is located.

   borough_number2county
        my $county = Geo::Postcodes::NO::borough_number2county($borough_number);

       The name of the county (fylke) where the specified borough number
       (kommune nummer) is located.

   type_of
         my $type = Geo::Postcodes::NO::type_of($postcode);

   type_verbose_of
        my $danish_description  = Geo::postcodes::NO::type_verbose_of($postcode);
        my $english_description = Geo::postcodes::type_verbose_of($postcode);

       A norwegian text describing the type. Use the base class for the
       english description.

       See the TYPE section for a description of the types.

   type2verbose
       Get the description of the specified type.

         my $norwegian_description = Geo::Postcodes::NO::type2verbose($type);
         my $english_description   = Geo::Postcodes::type2verbose($type);

METHODS
   new
       "my $P = Geo::Postcodes::NO->new($postcode);"

       Create a new postcode object. Internally this will call the "xxx_of"
       procedures for the fields supported by this class.

       The constructor will return undef when passed an invalid or illegal
       postcode.  Do not try method calls on it, as it is not an object. See
       the description of the legal and valid procedures above.

   postcode
        my $postcode = $P->postcode();

       The postcode, as given to the constructor (new).

   location
        my $location = $P->location();

       The postal location associated with the specified postcode.

   borough_number
        my $borough_number = $P->borough_number();

       The number of the borough (kommune) where the postcode is located.
       This is an official norwegian identifier.

   borough
        my $borough = $P->borough();

       The name of the borough (kommune) where the postcode is located.

   county
         my $county = $P->county();

       The name of the county (fylke) where the postcode is located.

   type
         my $type = $P->type();

       See the description of the procedure type_of above.

   type_verbose
       See the description of the procedure type_verbose_of above.

         my $type_norwegian = $P->type_verbose();
         my $type_english   = $P->Geo::Postcodes::type_verbose();

       Use this to get the description.

       See the TYPE section for a description of the types.

TYPE
       This class supports the following types for the postal locatuons:

       BX  Postbokser (Post Office box)

       ST  Gateadresser (Street address)

       SX  Serviceboks (Service box )

       IO  Kunde med eget postnummer (Individual owner)

       STBX
           Både gateadresser og postbokser (Either a Street address or a Post
           Office box)

       MU  Flere bruksområder (felles) (Multiple usage)

       Se Geo::Postcodes for furter descriptions.

CAVEAT
   POSTCODES
       The norwegain postcodes are four digit numbers, in the interval "0000"
       to "9999" (and this means that "0010" is legal, while "10" is not).

       Use legal to check for legal postcodes, and valid to check if the
       postcode is actually in use. Geo::Postcodes::NO->new($postcode) will
       return undef if passed an illegal or invalid postcode.

       An attempt to access the methods of a non-existent postcode object will
       result in a runtime error. This can be avoided by checking if the
       postal code is legal, before creating the object; valid($postcode)
       returns true or false.

   LEGAL BOROUGH NUMBERS
       Borough (Kommune) numbers are also four digit numbers (not to be
       confused with the postcodes), in the interval "0101" to "2399". The two
       first digits identifies the county (fylke).

   CHARACTER SET
       The library was written using the ISO-8859-1 (iso-latin1) character
       set, and the special norwegian letters 'Æ', 'Ø' and 'Å' occur regularly
       in the postal locations and borough and county names. Usage of other
       character sets may cause havoc.  Unicode is not tested.

       Note that the case insensitive search (in the 'selection'
       method/procedure) doesn't recognize an 'Æ' as an 'æ' (and so on). "use
       locale" in the application program should fix this, if the current
       locale supports these characters.

       Note that all names are given in UPPER CASE. This is courtesy of the
       norwegian postal service.

       See also the sample programs in the "eg/"-directory of the
       distribution, the tutorial ("perldoc Geo::Postcodes::Tutorial" or "man
       Geo::Postcodes::Tutorial") and the selection manual (perldoc
       Geo::Postcodes::Selection or man Geo::Postcodes::Selection) for usage
       details.

       The latest version of this library should always be available on CPAN,
       but see also the library home page; http://bbop.org/perl/GeoPostcodes
       for additional information and sample usage.
