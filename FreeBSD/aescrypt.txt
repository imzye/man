AESCRYPT(1)             FreeBSD General Commands Manual            AESCRYPT(1)

NAME
     aescrypt – encrypt data using Rijndael, the Advanced Encryption Standard
     winner

SYNOPSIS
     aescrypt -k keyfile [-s keysize]

DESCRIPTION
     The aescrypt utility encrypts data using the Rijndael algorithm, the
     winner of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) competition.  The
     encryption is done in Cipher Block Feedback (CFB-128) mode, with the salt
     randomly generated from data read from the /dev/urandom device.  The
     plaintext data is read from standard input and the encrypted data is
     written to standard output.

     The encryption key may be read from standard input or from a file,
     depending on the argument passed to the -k command-line option.  If “-”
     is used as a filename, the aescrypt utility reads as many hexadecimal
     digits as needed from standard input and then one additional byte to
     allow for a newline separating the key from the actual data to be
     encrypted.  If the filename is not “-”, the aescrypt utility opens the
     specified file and reads text lines from it until a line starting with
     the characters kk= is reached.  Those characters should be immediately
     followed by as many hexadecimal digits as needed; the rest of the line,
     as well as the rest of the file, is ignored.

     The encryption key may be 128, 192, or 256 bits long.  By default, the
     aescrypt utility uses (and expects to read) a 128-bit key, unless a
     different size is supplied by the -s keysize command-line option.

     The aescrypt utility reads 16 bytes (128 bits) from the /dev/urandom
     device to initialize the salt for the CFB-128 encryption.  The salt is
     prepended to the encrypted data in the output.

EXAMPLES
     Generate a random 128-bit value and store it into a keyfile suitable for
     the aescrypt utility:

           perl -e 'open(F, "<", "/dev/random") or die("$!\n"); read(F, $s,
           32); print "kk=".unpack("H*", $s)."\n"'

     Encrypt the contents of the /etc/hosts file with the generated (128-bit
     by default) key:

           aescrypt -k key.txt < /etc/hosts > hosts.aes

     Encrypt a string with a 192-bit key supplied directly:

           (echo '012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567'; echo
           'This is a test.') | ./aescrypt -s 192 -k - > test.aes

HISTORY
     The aescrypt utility was written by Eric Lee Green, and was modified to
     use Rijndael rather than Twofish by Randy Kaelber.  It uses the freely
     available Rijndael implementation by Antoon Bosselaers and Vincent
     Rijmen.  This manual page was written by Peter Pentchev in 2008.
