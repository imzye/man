SNIFFIT(5)                FreeBSD File Formats Manual               SNIFFIT(5)

NAME
       sniffit - configuration file for sniffit (name arbitrary)


DESCRIPTION
       This page describes the format for the config file for sniffit (see
       sniffit(8) ). This file allows you to specify in great detail witch
       packets should be processed by sniffit.  This file also controls (or
       will control) some functions for the continuous logging ('-L' option).

       A sniffit config file might look like (Be sure to end it with a BLANK
       line):

              # Sniffit Sample Config file -- Brecht Claerhout

              logfile /var/log/sniffit.today.log

              # First select all packets!
              select both mhosts 1
              select both mhosts 2

              # Now deselect all packets from/to those damn 'surfers'
              deselect both port 80
              deselect both port 8001

       This file will tell sniffit to process all packets on the subnet except
       those FROM/TO ports 80 and 8001 (thus we don't want logs of those mass
       WWW connections witch turn our logs unreadable).


GLOBAL FORMAT
       The file consists of lines, lines are formed by fields, fields are
       separated with SPACES (NO TABS).  Unix comment lines (starting with '#'
       are allowed).  So this gives us:

              <field1> <field2> <field3> <field4> <field5>


FIELD FORMAT
       <field1>
              select - Sniffit will look for packets that match the following
              description (other fields)

              deselect - Sniffit will ignore packets that match the
              description

              logfile - change the logfile name to <field2> instead of the
              default 'sniffit.log'


       <field2>
              from - Packets FROM the host matching the following desc. are
              considered.

              to - similar, Packets TO the....

              both - similar, Packets FROM or TO the....

              a filename - as an argument of 'logfile' in <field1>


       <field3>
              host - The (de)selection criteria involves a hostname.

              port - similar, ... a portnumber

              mhosts - The (de)selection criteria involves multiple-hosts,
              like with the wildcards in 0.3.0, but without the 'x'


       <field4>
              Either a hostname, a portnumber, a service name or a number-dot
              partial notation indicating multiple hosts depending on <field3>
              (service names like 'ftp' are resolved as the services available
              present on the host that runs Sniffit, and translated into a
              port nr)


       <field5>
              A portnumber, if <field3> was 'host' or 'mhosts' (optional, if
              not filled in, all ports are going to be (de)selected)


FILE INTERPRETING
       The config file is interpreted SEQUENTIAL, so watch it, don't mix lines
       in a file. Example:

                    select both mhosts 100.100.12.
                    deselect both port 80
                    select both host 100.100.12.2

              This file will get you the packets:
                    a) Send by hosts '100.100.12.*'
                    b) EXCEPT the WWW packets
                    c) BUT showing the WWW packets concerning
                       100.100.12.2

                    select both mhosts 100.100.12.
                    select both host 100.100.12.2
                    deselect both port 80

              Will give you the packets (probably unwanted result):
                    a) Send by hosts '100.100.12.*'
                    b) Send from/to 100.100.12.2 (useless line)
                    c) deselecting all WWW packets on the subnet
