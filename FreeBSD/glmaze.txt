NAME
       glmaze - multiplayer opengl maze game

SYNOPSIS
       glmaze [ server ]

DESCRIPTION
       glmaze is a multiplayer maze game based on the opengl 3d graphics
       engine.

       If a command line argument is present, glmaze tries to interpret this
       as the server name to connect to. If no argument was given, glmaze
       becomes the master client and starts a local server. Up to six players
       can join a session. Only the master client can start the session. Other
       players can join a running game. The game stops when the first player
       reaches ten kills. The player with the top score at this moment is the
       winner.
