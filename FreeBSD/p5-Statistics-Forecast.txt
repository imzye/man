NAME
       Statistics::Forecast - calculates a future value

DESCRIPTION
       This is a dummy Oriented Object module that calculates a future value
       by using existing values. The new value is calculated by using linear
       regression.

SYNOPSIS
          use Statistics::Forecast;

       Create forecast object

          my $FCAST = Statistics::Forecast->new("My Forecast Name");

       Add data

          $FCAST->{DataX} = \@Array_X;
          $FCAST->{DataY} = \@Array_Y;
          $FCAST->{NextX} = $NextX;

       Calculate the result

          $FCAST->calc;

       Get the result

          my $Result_Forecast = $FCAST->{ForecastY);

INTERNALS
       The equation for Forecast is:

          a+bx, where 'x' is the predicted value and
              _    _
          a = y + bx

          b = sum((x+x)(y-y))/sum(x-x)**2

METHODS
       new Receives a forecast name, only to remember and returns the blessed
           data structure as a Statistics::Forecast object.

            my $FCAST = Statistics::Forecast->new("My Forecast");

       calc
           Calculate and return the forecast value.

            $FCAST->calc;

       dump
           Prints data for debuging propose.

            $FCAST->dump;

       SumX
           Returns the sum of X values.

            my $SumOfX = $FCAST->{SumX};

       SumY
           Returns the sum of Y values.

            my $SumOfY = $FCAST->{SumY};

       SumXX
           Returns the sum of X**2 values.

            my $SumOfXX = $FCAST->{SumXX};

       SumXY
           Returns the sum of X * Y values.

            my $SumOfXY = $FCAST->{SumXY};

       AvgX
           Returns the average of X values.

            my $AvgX = $FCAST->{AvgX};

       AvgY
           Returns the average of Y values.

            my $AvgY = $FCAST->{AvgY};

       N   Return the number of X values.

            my $N = $FCAST->{N};

EXAMPLE
          use Statistics::Forecast;

          my @Y = (1,3,7,12);
          my @X = (1,2,3,4);

          my $FCAST = Statistics::Forecast->new("My Forecast");

          $FCAST->{DataX} = \@X;
          $FCAST->{DataY} = \@Y;
          $FCAST->{NextX} = 8;
          $FCAST->calc;

          print "The Forecast ", $FCAST->{ForecastName};
          print " has the forecast value: ", $FCAST->{ForecastY}, "\n";
