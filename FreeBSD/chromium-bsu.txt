DESCRIPTION
       chromium-bsu is a fast paced top down arcade style action shooter game.
       You progress through the game by destroying everything that you see on
       screen. There are a variety of 'power-ups' to assist you on the way.
       There is a big boss to destroy at the end of each level and there are
       various ships to destroy before you reach each boss.

TIPS
       Do not let ANY enemy ships get past your fighters!

       Use your fighters as weapons!

       Strategic suicide is a powerful tactic!

       Self-destruct to preserve your ammunition!

CONTROLS
       The input devices supported depend on the compile options used to
       build.

       You can control the ship with your mouse, keyboard (arrow keys) or
       joystick.

       To fire your weapons, hold the left mouse button, joystick buttons or
       the space bar.

       To pause the game, press pause or p on the keyboard.

       To blow up your ship, press enter/return or 0 twice or double right
       click.

       To switch to the next track in your music playlist, press n on the
       keyboard.

ENVIRONMENT
       The following environment variables are used.

       CHROMIUM_BSU_SCORE
              specifies the location of the user high-score file.

       CHROMIUM_BSU_DATA
              specifies the location of user-customised game data with the
              same layout and filenames as the system one.

       CHROMIUM_BSU_FONT
              When using the GLC backend, this specifies the font name to be
              used in the menu and the game if available.

              When using the FTGL backend, this specifies the path to the TTF
              font file used in the menu and the game.

FILES
       The following files are used.

       ~/.chromium-bsu
              contains various user preferences.

       ~/.chromium-bsu-score
              contains the user high-scores.

       ~/.chromium-bsu-music
              contains a list of music to play during the game.

       ~/.chromium-bsu-data/
              directory containing user-customized game data with the same
              layout and filenames as the system one.

       The game will also look in a system directory for data.

CONFIGURATION
       The configuration file is a plain text file. Each line contains a key,
       a single-space separator and then a numeric value (integer or floating
       point).  The following keys are recognised by the game.

       use_playList
              Enable/disable playlist support. This causes the game to open
              the ~/.chromium-bsu-music file and play the files listed there.
              Disabled by default.  Only works when using OpenAL.

       use_cdrom
              Enable/disable CDROM support. This causes the game to attempt to
              play any audio CD that might be available. This is disabled by
              default because the constant spinning up of the CD can be
              annoying and because CDs are less popular than MP3/OGG these
              days. Only works when compiled with SDL 1.X support.

       full_screen
              Enable/disable full-screen mode. This causes the game to fill
              the screen instead of just using a window. Disabled by default.
              Only works when using SDL support.

       true_color
              Enable/disable 24-bit color. When disabled it uses 16-bit color.
              Disabled by default. Only works when using SDL support.

       swap_stereo
              Enable/disable swapping sound orientation. Disabled by default.
              Only works when using OpenAL.

       auto_speed
              Use an alternate speed adjustment algorithm in certain
              situations. Disabled by default. Only works when using SDL
              support.

       show_fps
              Print the frames per second at the top right when in a game.
              Defaults to enabled.
