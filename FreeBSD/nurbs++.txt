NAME
       nurbs++-config - script to get information about the installed version
       of nurbs++

SYNOPSIS
       nurbs++-config [--prefix[=DIR]] [--exec-prefix[=DIR]] [--version]
       [--libs] [--cflags]

DESCRIPTION
       nurbs++-config is a tool that is used to configure to determine the
       compiler and linker flags that should be used to compile and link
       programs that use nurbs++. It is also used internally to the .m4 macros
       for GNU autoconf that are included with nurbs++.

OPTIONS
       nurbs++-config accepts the following options:

       --version
               Print the currently installed version of nurbs++ on the
               standard output.

       --libs  Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a nurbs++
               program.

       --cflags
               Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a
               nurbs++ program.

       --prefix
               Print the prefix with which nurbs++ was compiled.

       --prefix=PREFIX
               If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix
               that nurbs++ was built with when computing the output for the
               --cflags and --libs options. This option is also used for the
               exec prefix if --exec-prefix was not specified. This option
               must be specified before any --libs or --cflags options.

       --exec-prefix
               Print the exec-prefix with which nurbs++ was compiled.

       --exec-prefix=PREFIX
               If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation exec
               prefix that nurbs++ was built with when computing the output
               for the --cflags and --libs options.  This option must be
               specified before any --libs or --cflags options.
