Math::Symbolic::Custom::CCompiler(3)       User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Math::Symbolic::Custom::CCompiler - Compile Math::Symbolic trees to C

SYNOPSIS
         use Math::Symbolic qw/:all/;
         use Math::Symbolic::Custom::CCompiler;

         my $function = parse_from_string(... some expression ...);
         # ... calculations ... see Math::Symbolic manpage

         my $c_code = $function->to_c();
         # $c_code now contains C code that does the same as the original
         # function.

         my $anon_subroutine = $function->to_compiled_c();
         # Generates and compiles C code. Uses Inline::C to dynamically
         # link the results. Returns an anonymous Perl subroutine that
         # does the same as the original function.
         # But in compiled C. (Ca. 1000x faster than the tree-walking
         # involved with the value() method.)

DESCRIPTION
       This module extends the functionality of Math::Symbolic by offering
       facilities to compile symbolic math trees (formulas) to C code. It also
       uses Inline::C to compile and link the generated C code at run-time,
       thus allowing the user to do symbolic calculations in Perl with
       Math::Symbolic and then use the results in a fast numeric environment.

       This software generates code. Code generators are difficult to test,
       but the first release of the module is now 1.5 years old and I haven't
       received any bug reports, so I consider it somewhat stable now.

       Please read the manpage of Math::Symbolic::Compiler which comes with
       the Math::Symbolic distribution. Most of the gotchas involved with
       compiling the functions to Perl subroutines also apply to this module
       which compiles to C instead.

       Alternatively, you can use the module not for faster calculations from
       your Perl program, but to generate C code for you. I have used it to
       generate an implementation for (many!) Zernike Polynomials for work in
       C.

       The module adds two methods to all Math::Symbolic objects. These are:

   $ms_tree->to_c()
       This method returns the C code generated from the function. Please note
       that the code is extremely difficult to read for humans because
       variable and function names have been generated to not clash with any
       reserved words. Feel free to do search/replace on the results of you
       are bothered.

       This code is not intended to be read by humans, but to be understood by
       C compilers.

       The method takes one optional argument: An array reference. The
       referenced array is to contain some or all of the identifier names that
       where in the original mathematical formula. You can use the
       'signature()' method on a Math::Symbolic object to get at the
       identifiers (variable names) that were used. The order of the
       identifier names indicates the order in which the C function parameters
       are to be mapped to the identifiers. Omitted identifiers are appended
       to the list in alphabetic order. If no such array reference is passed,
       the arguments are assumed to be in alphabetic order altogether.

       Since this behaviour is equivalent to that of the compilation methods
       supplied by Math::Symbolic::Compiler, it is suggested that you read the
       corresponding manual for more detailed instructions.

   $ms_tree->to_compiled_c()
       This method generates the same code that 'to_c()' generates and
       compiles it using Inline::C and your local C compiler. The binary is
       then dynamically linked to your instance of perl through some scary
       magic in Inline::C. Go there and complain if you don't understand that
       because I, for sure, don't.

       Inline::C also generates an Perl wrapper for the compiled C function.
       This is then referenced and returned.  (The original package sub is
       deleted to prevent memory leakage.)
