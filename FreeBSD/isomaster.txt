ISO Master(1)                                                    ISO Master(1)

NAME
       isomaster - an ISO image editor

SYNTAX
       isomaster [image.iso]

DESCRIPTION
       ISO Master is an open-source, easy to use, graphical CD image editor
       for Linux and BSD. Basically you can use this program to extract files
       from an ISO, add files to an ISO, and create bootable ISOs - all in a
       graphical user interface.

       ISO Master can open ISO, NRG, and some MDF files but can only save as
       ISO.

OPTIONS
       The only command-line parameter supported is the name of the image to
       open.
