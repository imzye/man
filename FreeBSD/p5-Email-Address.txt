NAME
       Email::Address - RFC 2822 Address Parsing and Creation

VERSION
       version 1.913

SYNOPSIS
         use Email::Address;

         my @addresses = Email::Address->parse($line);
         my $address   = Email::Address->new(Casey => 'casey@localhost');

         print $address->format;

DESCRIPTION
       This class implements a regex-based RFC 2822 parser that locates email
       addresses in strings and returns a list of "Email::Address" objects
       found.  Alternatively you may construct objects manually. The goal of
       this software is to be correct, and very very fast.

       Version 1.909 and earlier of this module had vulnerabilies
       (CVE-2015-7686 <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-
       bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7686>) and (CVE-2015-12558
       <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-12558>) which
       allowed specially constructed email to cause a denial of service. The
       reported vulnerabilities and some other pathalogical cases (meaning
       they really shouldn't occur in normal email) have been addressed in
       version 1.910 and newer.  If you're running version 1.909 or older, you
       should update!

       Alternatively, you could switch to Email::Address::XS which has a
       backward compatible API. Why not just use that?

   Package Variables
       ACHTUNG!  Email isn't easy (if even possible) to parse with a regex, at
       least if you're on a "perl" prior to 5.10.0.  Providing regular
       expressions for use by other programs isn't a great idea, because it
       makes it hard to improve the parser without breaking the "it's a regex"
       feature.  Using these regular expressions is not encouraged, and
       methods like "Email::Address->is_addr_spec" should be provided in the
       future.

       Several regular expressions used in this package are useful to others.
       For convenience, these variables are declared as package variables that
       you may access from your program.

       These regular expressions conform to the rules specified in RFC 2822.

       You can access these variables using the full namespace. If you want
       short names, define them yourself.

         my $addr_spec = $Email::Address::addr_spec;

       $Email::Address::addr_spec
           This regular expression defined what an email address is allowed to
           look like.

       $Email::Address::angle_addr
           This regular expression defines an $addr_spec wrapped in angle
           brackets.

       $Email::Address::name_addr
           This regular expression defines what an email address can look like
           with an optional preceding display name, also known as the
           "phrase".

       $Email::Address::mailbox
           This is the complete regular expression defining an RFC 2822 email
           address with an optional preceding display name and optional
           following comment.

   Class Methods
       parse
             my @addrs = Email::Address->parse(
               q[me@local, Casey <me@local>, "Casey" <me@local> (West)]
             );

           This method returns a list of "Email::Address" objects it finds in
           the input string.  Please note that it returns a list, and expects
           that it may find multiple addresses.  The behavior in scalar
           context is undefined.

           The specification for an email address allows for infinitely
           nestable comments.  That's nice in theory, but a little over done.
           By default this module allows for one (1) level of nested comments.
           If you think you need more, modify the
           $Email::Address::COMMENT_NEST_LEVEL package variable to allow more.

             $Email::Address::COMMENT_NEST_LEVEL = 10; # I'm deep

           The reason for this hardly-limiting limitation is simple:
           efficiency.

           Long strings of whitespace can be problematic for this module to
           parse, a bug which has not yet been adequately addressed.  The
           default behavior is now to collapse multiple spaces into a single
           space, which avoids this problem.  To prevent this behavior, set
           $Email::Address::COLLAPSE_SPACES to zero.  This variable will go
           away when the bug is resolved properly.

           In accordance with RFC 822 and its descendants, this module demands
           that email addresses be ASCII only.  Any non-ASCII content in the
           parsed addresses will cause the parser to return no results.

       new
             my $address = Email::Address->new(undef, 'casey@local');
             my $address = Email::Address->new('Casey West', 'casey@local');
             my $address = Email::Address->new(undef, 'casey@local', '(Casey)');

           Constructs and returns a new "Email::Address" object. Takes four
           positional arguments: phrase, email, and comment, and original
           string.

           The original string should only really be set using "parse".

       purge_cache
             Email::Address->purge_cache;

           One way this module stays fast is with internal caches. Caches live
           in memory and there is the remote possibility that you will have a
           memory problem. On the off chance that you think you're one of
           those people, this class method will empty those caches.

           I've loaded over 12000 objects and not encountered a memory
           problem.

       disable_cache
       enable_cache
             Email::Address->disable_cache if memory_low();

           If you'd rather not cache address parses at all, you can disable
           (and re-enable) the Email::Address cache with these methods.  The
           cache is enabled by default.

   Instance Methods
       phrase
             my $phrase = $address->phrase;
             $address->phrase( "Me oh my" );

           Accessor and mutator for the phrase portion of an address.

       address
             my $addr = $address->address;
             $addr->address( "me@PROTECTED.com" );

           Accessor and mutator for the address portion of an address.

       comment
             my $comment = $address->comment;
             $address->comment( "(Work address)" );

           Accessor and mutator for the comment portion of an address.

       original
             my $orig = $address->original;

           Accessor for the original address found when parsing, or passed to
           "new".

       host
             my $host = $address->host;

           Accessor for the host portion of an address's address.

       user
             my $user = $address->user;

           Accessor for the user portion of an address's address.

       format
             my $printable = $address->format;

           Returns a properly formatted RFC 2822 address representing the
           object.

       name
             my $name = $address->name;

           This method tries very hard to determine the name belonging to the
           address.  First the "phrase" is checked. If that doesn't work out
           the "comment" is looked into. If that still doesn't work out, the
           "user" portion of the "address" is returned.

           This method does not try to massage any name it identifies and
           instead leaves that up to someone else. Who is it to decide if
           someone wants their name capitalized, or if they're Irish?

   Overloaded Operators
       stringify
             print "I have your email address, $address.";

           Objects stringify to "format" by default. It's possible that you
           don't like that idea. Okay, then, you can change it by modifying
           $Email:Address::STRINGIFY. Please consider modifying this package
           variable using "local". You might step on someone else's toes if
           you don't.

             {
               local $Email::Address::STRINGIFY = 'host';
               print "I have your address, $address.";
               #   geeknest.com
             }
             print "I have your address, $address.";
             #   "Casey West" <casey@geeknest.com>

           Modifying this package variable is now deprecated. Subclassing is
           now the recommended approach.

   Did I Mention Fast?
       On his 1.8GHz Apple MacBook, rjbs gets these results:

         $ perl -Ilib bench/ea-vs-ma.pl bench/corpus.txt 5
                          Rate  Mail::Address Email::Address
         Mail::Address  2.59/s             --           -44%
         Email::Address 4.59/s            77%             --

         $ perl -Ilib bench/ea-vs-ma.pl bench/corpus.txt 25
                          Rate  Mail::Address Email::Address
         Mail::Address  2.58/s             --           -67%
         Email::Address 7.84/s           204%             --

         $ perl -Ilib bench/ea-vs-ma.pl bench/corpus.txt 50
                          Rate  Mail::Address Email::Address
         Mail::Address  2.57/s             --           -70%
         Email::Address 8.53/s           232%             --

       ...unfortunately, a known bug causes a loss of speed the string to
       parse has certain known characteristics, and disabling cache will also
       degrade performance.

PERL VERSION
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It
       should work on any version of perl released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made
       that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version
       may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.
