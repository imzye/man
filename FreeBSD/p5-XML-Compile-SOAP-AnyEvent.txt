NAME
       XML::Compile::Transport::SOAPHTTP_AnyEvent - exchange XML via
       AnyEvent::HTTP

INHERITANCE
        XML::Compile::Transport::SOAPHTTP_AnyEvent
          is a XML::Compile::Transport
          is a XML::Compile::SOAP::Extension

SYNOPSIS
        use XML::Compile::Transport::SOAPHTTP_AnyEvent;

        my $http = XML::Compile::Transport::SOAPHTTP_AnyEvent->new(@options);
        my $send = $http->compileClient(@options2);

        my $call = $wsdl->compileClient
          ( operation => 'some-port-name'
          , transport => $send
          , async     => 1      # required!
          );

        sub handler
          { my ($xmlout, $trace) = @_;
            # so something
          };

        $call->($xmlin, _callback => \&handler);

DESCRIPTION
       This module handles the exchange of (XML) messages, according to the
       rules of SOAP (any version).  The module does not known how to parse or
       compose XML, but only worries about the HTTP aspects.

       In contrairy to XML::Compile::Transport::SOAPHTTP, this implementation
       can be used in various event-driven environments, via AnyEvent::HTTP.

       $obj->compileClient(%options)
           Compile an HTTP client handler.  Returned is a subroutine which is
           called with a text represenation of the XML request, or an
           XML::LibXML tree.  In SCALAR context, an XML::LibXML parsed tree of
           the answer message is returned.  In LIST context, that answer is
           followed by a HASH which contains trace information.

            -Option    --Defined in             --Default
             action                               ''

             xml_format  XML::Compile::Transport  0

           action => URI
           header => HTTP::Headers object
             Versions of XML::Compile, XML::Compile::SOAP, and LWP will be
             added to simplify bug reports.

           hook => CODE
           kind => DIRECTION
             What kind of interactie, based on the four types defined by
             WSDL(1): "notification-operation" (server initiated, no answer
             required), "one-way" (client initiated, no answer required),
             "request-response" (client initiated, the usual in both
             directions), "solicit-response" (server initiated "challenge").

           method => 'POST'|'M-POST'
             With "POST", you get the standard HTTP exchange.  The "M-POST" is
             implements the (Microsoft) HTTP Extension Framework.  Some
             servers accept both, other require a specific request.

           mime_type => STRING
           mpost_id => INTEGER
             With method "M-POST", the header extension fields require (any)
             number to be grouped.

           soap => 'SOAP11'|'SOAP12'|OBJECT
           xml_format => 0|1|2
       $obj->headerAddVersions($header)
       XML::Compile::Transport::SOAPHTTP_AnyEvent->headerAddVersions($header)
           Adds some lines about module versions, which may help debugging or
           error reports.  This is called when a new client or server is being
           created.
