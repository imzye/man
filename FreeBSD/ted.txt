NAME
       Ted - an easy rich text processor (RTF file editor)

SYNOPSIS
   Interactive calls as a GUI text processor
       Ted [ settings ] [ filename-1 ] [ filename-2 .....  ]

   Special command-line calls
       Ted [ settings ] --command [ arg-1 .....  ] [ arg-2 .....  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Ted is an easy rich text processor (RTF file editor) with a graphic
       user interface.  For more information, see the users' manual (details
       below). Besides that, Ted is a utility to convert RTF files to various
       formats. One of its goals is to make it possible to produce decent
       looking documents avoiding the pain of antiquated packages like nroff
       that I had to use to type this man page.

   Ted can read the following file formats
       Documents can be read from files or from standard input. Ted only reads
       from standard input in calls that consume one single input document.
       (a file, a pipe, or what you type as a proficient RTF guru)

       rtf    Rich Text Files with extension *.rtf or -rtf- for standard
              input.

       txt    Plain Text Files with extension *.txt or -txt- for standard
              input.  The encoding of the text file is assumed to be UTF-8. To
              open files with a different encoding, use the iconv command.

   Ted can write the following file formats
       Documents can be written to files or to standard output.

       rtf    Rich Text Files with extension *.rtf or -rtf- for standard
              output.

       txt    Plain Text files with extension *.txt or -txt- for standard
              output.  The encoding of the text file is UTF-8. To save files
              with a different encoding, use the iconv command. If Ted saves a
              document to plain text, it discards all formatting and all
              illustrations.

       html   Hypertext Markup Language files with extension *.html or -html-
              for standard output.  If Ted saves HTML to standard output, it
              discards all images and all embedded objects.

       eml    HTML Mail message format (rfc 2557) files with extension *.eml
              or -eml- for standard output.  The output can be piped into
              ssmtp or mailx as a HTML formatted mail message.

       epub   EPUB e-book files with extension *.epub or -epub- for standard
              output.  The document is saved in the EPUB electronic book
              format that is supported by most e-readers and tablets.

       ps     PostScript files with extension *.ps or -ps- for standard
              output.  The output can be printed or converted to PDF.

       svg    Scalable Vector Graphics files with extension *.svg or -svg- for
              standard output.  The output can be used as an illustration.

       pdf    Portable Document Format files with extension *.pdf or -pdf- for
              standard output.  The output can be viewed with the Adobe
              Acrobat reader or compatible programs. Ted uses GhostScript
              (ps2pdf and gs) to convert PostScript to pdf.

COMMAND LINE CALLS
   Ted
       Show initial window with menu options to open files and to exit Ted.

   Ted doc1.rtf doc2.txt ..
       Open the documents on the command line.

   Ted --Find pattern f1.rtf f2.txt
       Open the files on the command line and search for pattern.

   Ted --RegFind pattern f1.rtf f2.txt
       Open the documents on the command line and search for pattern. Pattern
       is a regular expression. Ted uses the pcre regular expression matching
       library by Philip Hazel. For documentation see http://www.pcre.org.
       (Please realize that the casual user does not need to use or understand
       regular expressions.)

   Ted --TtfToAfm x.ttf y.afm
       Make an afm file that describes a true type font. This can be practical
       when you manually configure fonts for Ted.

   Ted --RtfToPs < x.rtf > y.ps
       Obsolete invocation: Use --printToFile. -rtf- -ps-

   Ted --RtfToPsPaper A4 < x.rtf > y.ps
       Obsolete invocation: Use --printToFilePaper. -rtf- -ps- A4

   Ted --version
       Show the version of Ted.

   Ted --platform
       Show the platform for which Ted was built.

   Ted --build
       Show the host and the date where Ted was built.

   Ted --fullVersion
       Show version, platform and build.

   Ted --saveTo f1.rtf f2.txt
       Read a file and save it. (in a different supported format) Supported
       formats are *.txt *.rtf and *.html. As Ted writes relatively readable
       rtf, this can be used as a kind of rtf pretty-printer.

   Ted --printToFile x.rtf y.ps
       Convert a document to PostScript. Format for the default paper format.
       Use -rtf- for the document name to read the document from standard
       input. Use -ps- as output name to emit PostScript to standard output.
       This call is used by the rtf2pdf.sh script. If you use the script from
       an internet scripting tool like PHP, make sure that both Ted and gs are
       in the PATH. Note that this produces ps files with Teds default paper
       size.

   Ted --printToFilePaper x.rtf y.ps A4
       Convert a document to PostScript. Format for the paper size given.
       Refer to --printToFile for IO redirections. Note that this produces ps
       files with the given paper size.

   Ted --print x.rtf
       Print the document on the default printer. Format for the default paper
       size.

   Ted --printPaper x.rtf a4
       Print the document on the default printer. Format for the paper size
       given.

   Ted --printToPrinter x.rtf lp1
       Print the document on the printer given. Format for the default paper
       size.

   Ted --printToPrinterPaper x.rtf lp1 letter
       Print the document on the printer given. Format for the paper size
       given.

   Ted --setProperty property value ....
       See below

   Ted --FontsDocuments /tmp/fontsdocs
       Create a directory and for every font that Ted knows about, store a
       document with all the symbols in the font. This is excellent testing
       material. It can also be used to view the fonts. The checkfontsdocs.sh
       job can be used to check whether the documents are correctly handled.

   Ted --GSFontmapForFiles `pwd`/*.ttf
   Ted --GSFontmapForFiles `pwd`/*.pfb
       Emit a fragment for a GhostScript Fontmap file. The second and
       subsequent arguments are *.ttf, *.pfa or *.pfb file names. It always
       always makes sense to use absolute font file names: GhostScript needs
       to know where to look for the fonts.

   Ted --AfmForFontFiles `pwd`/*.ttf
       Create an afm file for all *.pfa, *.pfb, *.ttf files on the command
       line. Note that to run the command, you need to have writing permission
       to the Ted afm directory, or at least in the localfonts subdirectory.
       Also note that you need to run the command with a umask that gives the
       generated afm files the correct permissions (022). The
       ++AfmForFontFiles variant tries to leave information in the AFM files
       on how to match X11 fonts to the fonts. With recent versions of Ted
       that use fontconfig, that is not really relevant.

OPTIONS
       Ted supports the following configuration options. Default values are
       compiled into the Ted executable program. Ted searches for values in
       the following locations: (1) The command line, (2)
       ${HOME}/Ted.properties (3) @DATADIR@/Ted/Ted-${LOCALE}.properties, (4)
       @DATADIR@/Ted/Ted.properties. Unknown (or misspelled) properties are
       silently ignored. Use the --property=value or the --setProperty
       property value syntax on the command line.


       magnification
              Magnification for drawing documents on the screen. The default
              value is 100%. The alternative format 1.0 for 100% is also
              supported. It has the disadvantage that it depends on the
              decimal sign of the current locale. (E.G: 1,2 for 120% in
              Western Europe.) Very small and very big values are ignored.
              100% magnification translates to 96 DPI on screen.

       unit   The unit that is used by default. This property  influences the
              appearance of the ruler and the interpretation of numbers
              entered in the format tool. Possible values are: inch, ", cm,
              mm, points, pt, picas, pi. The default is inch.

       paper  The format of the paper in the printer. The paper format is also
              used as the default page size for new documents. If a smaller
              page size is used for a document, Ted uses the Ted.paper
              property to print in the upper left corner of the paper.
              Possible values are:  a4,a5,letter,legal,executive and strings
              in the  form <Width> x <Height> or <Width> x <Height> <Unit>
              where <Width> and <Height> are numbers. Values for units are
              given above. If <Unit> is omitted, the value of the 'unit'
              property is assumed. Plain text files do not store a paper size
              for the file inside the file. The Ted.paper property is used for
              the page layout of every plain text file that Ted opens. Note
              that Ted uses the file /etc/papersize to find a default paper
              format. The default format can be overridden with any of the
              configuration mechanisms.

       leftMargin, topMargin, rightMargin, bottomMargin:
              The default width of the page margins. The format is <Width> or
              <Width> <Unit>. Width is a number. Unit is one of the units
              mentioned above. The default unit is the value of unit above.

       defaultPrinter
              If you want to use a different printer than the system default
              printer as the default printer from Ted, you can set this
              property to select that printer the first time you use the Print
              Dialog. The value is the name of a printer. Use the same names
              that you use in the lp -d somePrinter, or the lpr -P somePrinter
              commands.

       afmDirectory
              The directory where Ted looks for font metric files. Ted only
              uses font metric files if fontconfig is disabled. Without
              fontcongig, only fonts that have a metric file in this directory
              can be used by Ted. In a default installation, metric files are
              expected in @DATADIR@/Ted/afm. This property is particularly
              useful when you cannot install Ted as root, and hence you have
              to store the metric files in some private directory. You can
              also make the afmDirectory point to the GhostScript fonts
              directory. E.G. to /usr/share/ghostscript/fonts. Refer to the
              section on adding fonts for more details. Use the gs -h command
              to find the exact location of the GhostScript afm files.

       spellToolSystemDicts
              The directory where Ted looks for spelling dictionaries. In a
              default installation, spelling dictionaries are expected in
              @DATADIR@/Ted/dfa. This property is particularly useful when you
              cannot install Ted as root, and hence you have to store the
              dictionaries in some private directory.

       documentFileName
              The name of this online document file. In a default installation
              this is @DATADIR@/Ted/TedDocument-en_US.rtf.

       customPrintCommand
              A command to print through a custom printer command. Refer to
              the paragraph on printing for details.

       customPrinterName
              The name that is used to designate the custom printer command on
              the Print Dialog. Refer to the paragraph on printing for
              details.

       customPrintCommand2, customPrinterName2:
              To configure a second custom printer.

       printDialogShowPlacementDrawing:
              Some laptops have microscopic screens. Setting this property to
              0 hides the diagram that shows the placement of the document
              pages on the sheets of paper. This is to make the dialog a lot
              lower and to fit on the screen of this kind of computer.

       showTableGrid
              By default, Ted draws a grid to show the structure of tables
              without borders. If you set this property to 0 no grid will be
              drawn.

       fontDirectory
              The directory where Ted looks for fonts to include (embed) in
              its printed documents. Refer to the section on adding fonts for
              more details. Use the gs -h command to find the exact value.
              This property is only used on traditional UNIX systems that do
              not use fontconfig. AFM files that have been generated by Ted
              have a Ted specific comment that gives the font file name. So
              this property is only relevant is neither fontconfig, nor Ted
              generated AFM files are used.

       usePostScriptFilters
              PostScript levels 2 and 3 support the concept of filters.
              Filters make it possible to code the images in a PostScript file
              much more efficiently. You can deactivate this option when you
              have a printer that does not support level 2 filters and the
              /FlateDecode filter. Recent versions of GhostScript support
              both. If you cannot  print all images deactivate this setting.
              To deactivate set the value to 0.

       usePostScriptIndexedImages:
              PostScript level 2 has a variant of the image operator that
              makes it possible to include images with a color indirection via
              a palette in the PostScript file. As many if the images included
              in rtf documents are of this kind, setting this property can
              help you to reduce the volume of the PostScript that is sent to
              the printer. All level 2 implementations, including GhostScript
              support indexed images. If you cannot  print all images
              deactivate this setting. To deactivate set the value to 0.

       customPsSetupFilename:
              The name of a PostScript file that is used for special printer
              setup and configuration. The contents of the file are inserted
              as part of the Setup section of the PostScript output.

       skipBlankPages
              If this parameter is set to 1, Ted skips blank pages while
              printing. Pages that are completely empty will not be printed.
              If the document has headers and footers, the relevant headers
              and footers will be printed on the page and the page will not be
              blank.

       skipEmptyPages
              If this parameter is set to 1, Ted skips empty pages while
              printing. Pages that are completely empty will not be printed. A
              page is not considered to be empty if it actually is empty, but
              the document has headers and footers. Under many circumstances
              the page would contain a header and a footer and it will be
              printed.

       omitHeadersOnEmptyPages:
              If this parameter is set to 1, Ted will not print the page
              headers and footers on pages that do not contain any text from
              the document body or from notes. By design, this property
              interacts with the skipEmptyPages and skipBlankPages in the
              following surprising way: If both omitHeadersOnEmptyPages and
              skipBlankPages are set, a page without any body content will not
              be printed at all. However, if both omitHeadersOnEmptyPages and
              skipEmptyPages are set, a page without any body content will be
              printed as an empty page.

       findToolExplicitFocus
              Tell the find tool to get the keyboard focus when you activate
              it. Usually this is desirable behavior. However some window
              managers make Ted crash when it tried to manipulate the keyboard
              focus. For that reason you can set the findToolExplicitFocus to
              0 to tell Ted not to move the keyboard focus to the find tool to
              avoid problems.

       autoHyphenate
              If a word in a line of text is wider than the width allocated
              for the paragraph, Ted makes the word protrude beyond the right
              margin. If you set the autoHyphenate property to 1, Ted will
              automatically insert optional hyphens (-) to fold the word. In
              general this is undesirable behavior. Only set the property on
              the command line and only if you use Ted to format documents. If
              the autoHyphenate property is set while you edit documents, the
              optional hyphens will end up in completely arbitrary locations
              in the document.

       avoidFontconfig
              If Ted has been compiled to use fontconfig and freetype, setting
              this option to 1 tells Ted not to use fontconfig or freetype. It
              will fall back to the afm files and plain X11 text rendering.
              Turning off fontconfig has the disadvantage that fewer fonts are
              available and that text looks far worse on screen. For rtf to
              PostScript/PDF conversion it has the advantage that Ted is less
              dependent on the environment and that documents, that use
              standard fonts, are formatted even more more similar to what MS-
              Word does.

       preferBase35Fonts
              If Ted has been compiled to use fontconfig and freetype, setting
              this option to 1 tells Ted not to use fontconfig to obtain the
              list of fonts. It will use the Adobe collection of 35 core
              PostScript fonts. Turning off fontconfig had the disadvantage
              the fewer fonts are available. The advantage is that the
              documents that you make only use a set of widely supported
              standard fonts.

       embedFonts
              If Ted knows the name and location of font files on the file
              system, it will embed the fonts in its print out. This has the
              advantage that the generated PostScript will print identically
              on all printers. The disadvantage is that the files are bigger
              and possibly print slower. If you set this property to 0, Ted
              will not embed any fonts in its printout.

       useKerning
              If set to 0, Ted will ignore kerning information in the afm
              files. This will make Ted start a little faster. The name
              suggests that otherwise, Ted will use kerning. That is not the
              case. The current version of Ted will never produce kerned
              output. The pretentious name was chosen because it is simple an
              it can be used in the future for what it actually suggests.

       shadingMeshTwips
              The rtf file format supports 12 patterns that can be used as a
              background in the document. A shading can be applied to table
              cells, paragraphs and even separate pieces of text. Though Ted
              does not support shading patterns in the user interface, it does
              so if you print a document, or if you convert existing documents
              with a shading to file to convert them to Acrobat PDF. For
              printing, fine patterns are preferable to coarse ones and for
              PDF files that you want to view on screen, coarse patterns are
              preferable. For that reason, the default value of 3 points for
              the grain of the pattern is often undesirable. With this
              parameter, you can set the distance between the lines that make
              up the shading. The value is the distance between the lines in
              twips. Sensible values are between 10 and 100 twips. (0.5 and 5
              points)

       lenientRtf
              In normal operation, Ted performs elementary checks on the
              validity of rtf files. E.G. It checks whether the braces in the
              rtf file match. If you set this property to 1, the checks are
              much more lenient and Ted will try to open files that are
              syntactically incorrect.

       traceEdits
              In normal operation, Ted keeps a trace of your editing actions.
              Ted uses the trace file to remember the information that it
              needs to execute Undo en Repeat actions. The trace is also used
              to recover your work after a crash. If you set the traceEdits
              property to 0 (zero) Ted will not make a trace. This also
              deactivates the Undo, Repeat and Recover actions.

       pdfOutline
              By default, Ted inserts pdfmarks in the PostScript that it
              issues to produce an outline when the PostScript is converted to
              Acrobat PDF. Set this value to 0 (zero) if you do not want an
              outline.

BUGS
       It can take a minute to start - before the Ted window appears on the
       display - because Ted polls the system printers.
