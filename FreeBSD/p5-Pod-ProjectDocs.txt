NAME
       pod2projdocs - generates CPAN like project documents from pod.

SYNOPSIS
       pod2projdocs [options]

        Options:
           -help         display this help and exist
           -out          directory path that you want to generate documents into
           -lib          your project's library-root-directory path
           -title        your project's title
           -desc         your project's description
           -noindex      don't create index for all generated pages
           -forcegen     generate documents each time, ignoring last modified timestamp
           -nosourcecode suppress inclusion of the original source code in the generated output
           -lang         set this language as xml:lang (default 'en')
           -except       the files matches this regex won't be parsed

        You can set each option with their first character,
        for example, you can write -o instead of -out.

        And you can generate documents from multiple library directories.
