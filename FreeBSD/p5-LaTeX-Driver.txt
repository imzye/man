       TO BE EXPANDED

REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
OPTIONS
       "-output=FILE"
           specifies that the formatted file should be written to "FILE".  If
           this option is not specified, or is specified as ""-"" then the
           file will be written to standard output, otherwise if an input file
           is specified then the it will be formatted in place and the output
           file will have the same name as the input file, but with the
           original extension replaced with ".dvi".

       "-tt2"
           specifies that the source document should be taken to be a Template
           Toolkit template and processed through that before being fed to the
           "LaTeX::Driver" module for latex formatting.

       "-define=NAME=VALUE"
           defines the template variable NAME to have the value VALUE.
           Multiple template variables may be defined and these are passed to
           the Template Toolkit processing stage (they are ignored if the
           "-tt2" option is not specified).
