TTYPLAY(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             TTYPLAY(1)

NAME
       ttyplay - player of the tty session recorded by ttyrec

SYNOPSIS
       ttyplay [-s SPEED] [-n] [-p] file

DESCRIPTION
       Ttyplay plays the tty session in file, which was recorded previously by
       ttyrec(1).

       When -p option is given, ttyplay output the file as it grows.  It means
       that you can see the "live" shell session running by another user.

       If you hit any key during playback, it will go right to the next
       character typed.  This is handy when examining sessions where a user
       spends a lot of time at a prompt.

       Additionally, there are some special keys defined:

       + or f
               double the speed of playback.

       - or s
               halve the speed of playback.

       1      set playback to speed 1.0 again.


OPTIONS
       -s SPEED
              multiple the playing speed by SPEED (default is 1).

       -n     no wait mode.  Ignore the timing information in file.

       -p     peek another person's tty session.
