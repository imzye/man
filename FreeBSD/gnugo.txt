DESCRIPTION
       GNU Go plays a game of Go against the user. It has many other features:
       it can play against itself or another program, analyse and score a
       recorded game. GNU Go is compliant with Go modem protocol, load and
       save game in the Smart Game format.

       GNU Go default is a simple alpha-numeric board display, but you can use
       a client such as CGoban.

       The game of Go

       Go is a game of strategy between two players usually played on a 19x19
       grid called goban. The two players put black and white stones on the
       goban to enclose territory. Go was invented about 4000 years ago in
       ancient China. Other names for this game are (Chinese) Wei Chi,
       (Korean) Baduk and (Ing) Goe.

       Playing a game in ASCII mode

       To start a game with default options, just invoke "gnugo". The board
       will be drawn at your terminal using ASCII letters.  In this mode, you
       can get help on available commands by the h key.  To play as Black with
       4 stones handicap, with a 0.5 komi, recording the game in the file
       record.sgf:

        gnugo --color black --handicap 4 --komi 0.5 -o record.sgf


       Playing a game with CGoban

       CGoban is a general purpose client program by Bill Shubert for playing
       Go. It runs under X Window System with a beautiful resizeable graphic
       display. To use GNU Go under X Window System, obtain the most recent
       version of CGoban from Bill Shubert's web site

       http://www.igoweb.org/~wms/comp/cgoban/index.html

       Start CGoban. When the CGoban Control panel comes up, select `Go
       Modem.'  You will get the Go Modem Protocol Setup. Choose one (or both)
       of the players to be ``Program,'' and fill out the box to the path to
       gnugo. After clicking OK, you get the Game Setup window. Choose ``Rules
       Set'' to be Japanese (otherwise handicaps won't work). Set the board
       size and handicap if you want. Click OK and you are ready to go.

       In the Go Modem Protocol Setup window, when you specify the path to GNU
       Go, you can give it command line options, such as --quiet to suppress
       most messages. Since the Go Modem Protocol preempts standard I/O, other
       messages are sent to stderr, even if they are not error messages. These
       will appear in the terminal from which you started CGoban.

       Scoring system

       The game stops when both players pass. GNU Go will attempt to compute
       and report the score to you. It may occasionally make mistakes due to
       wrong evaluation of the status of a group. You can check the score as
       follows. In ASCII mode, at the end of the game, stones believed dead
       are marked in lower case letters, and you have the option of toggling
       their status before counting.  Using CGoban, you may use CGoban's
       counting facility to count the game using either Japanese or Chinese
       rules.

       Viewing a stored game

       gnugo -l filename.sgf --mode ascii

       loads filename.sgf and lets you navigate through the game by using the
       commands forward, back, goto and last.  It is not possible to navigate
       through variations in ascii mode.  You may also use CGoban to view
       stored games. CGoban can navigate variations.

       Documentation

       The files in the doc directory contain detailed documentation about
       debugging options and internal program structure. Other documentation
       may be found in comments throughout the source code.

       Go Modem Protocol

       The Go Modem Protocol is a standard interface between Go programs and
       graphical display.

       The Go Modem Protocol was developed by Bruce Wilcox with input from
       David Fotland, Anders Kierulf and others. Any Go program *should* use
       this protocol since it is standard. Since CGoban supports this
       protocol, the user interface for any Go program can be done entirely
       through CGoban. Using the Go Modem Protocol, you can play with another
       computer running a different program (even on a different operating
       system) using a modem, a serial cable or over the internet if the other
       program also supports the protocol. You can also communicate with the
       Go servers using CGoban.

       Smart Game Format

       Games (with comments, variations and other features) can be stored in
       the Smart Game Format (SGF). This format originated in Anders Kierulf's
       program Smart Go. Martin Muller and Arno Hollosi developed the current
       standard, which may be found at

       http://www.red-bean.com/sgf/

       GNU Go supports the Smart Game Format.

OPTIONS
       Main options

       --mode mode

       force the playing mode (ascii', gtp or gmp). Default is ASCII. If no
       terminal is detected GMP (Go Modem Protocol) will be assumed.

       --replay color

       replay the game generating moves for color, where color is white,
       black, or both. (requires -l)

       --quiet

       Don't print copyright and other informational messages.

       -l, --infile file

       Load the SGF file (to score or analyze a recorded game).

       -L, --until move

       Stop loading just before move is played (e.g. 154 or L10).

       -o, --outfile file

       Save the played game to file in SGF format.

       Game Options:

       --boardsize num

       Set the board size to use (1-19). Default is 19, other common formats
       are 13 and 9.

       --color color

       Choose your color (black or white). Black plays first, White gets the
       komi compensation.

       --handicap num

       Set the number of handicap stones.

       --komi num

       Set the komi (points given to white player to compensate advantage of
       the first move, usually 5.5 or 0.5). Default is 5.5.

       Informative Output:

       -v, --version

       Display the version of GNU Go.

       -h, --help

       Display help message.

       --help debug

       Display help about debugging options.

       --copyright

       Display copyright notice.

       Debugging and advanced options:

       -T, --printboard

       Show board each move.

       --level num

       Level of play. (default 10; smaller=faster, weaker).

       -b, --benchmark num

       Benchmarking mode - can be used with -l.

       -t, --trace

       Verbose tracing (use twice or more to trace reading).

       -r, --seed num

       Set random number seed.

       --score [estimate⎪finish⎪aftermath]

       Count or estimate territory of the input file. Usage:

       gnugo --score estimate -l filename

       Loads the SGF file and estimates the score by measuring the influence.
       Use with -L if you want the estimate somewhere else than at the end of
       the file.

       gnugo --score finish -l filename

       Loads the SGF file and gnugo continues to play by itself up to the very
       end. Then the winner is determined by counting the territory.

       gnugo --score aftermath -l filename

       Similar to --score finish except that a more accurate but slower
       algorithm is used to determine the final status of the groups.

       If the option -o outputfilename is provided, the results will also be
       written as comment at the end of the output file.

       --printsgf outfile

       Load SGF file, output final position (requires -l).

BUGS
       If you find a bug, please send the SGF output file to gnugo@gnu.org
       together with a description of the bug.
