           my %returned=Gtk2::Chmod->ask('/etc/passwd');

METHODS
   ask
       This creates a dialog that provides a dialog for getting what mode
       should be used for a file/directory when doing chmod.

       The data is returned as a hash

       The initial settings are based off of the file/direcotry specified.

           my %returned=Gtk2::Chmod->ask($item);
           if($returned{error}){
               print "Error!\n".$returned{errorString}."\n";
           }else{
               use Data::Dumper;
               print Dumper(\%returned);

              if($returned{pressed} eq 'ok'){
                  if(-d $item){
                      chmod($returned{dirmode}, $item);
                  }else{
                      chmod($returned{filemode}, $item);
                  }
              }

           }
