NAME
       Clone - recursively copy Perl datatypes

SYNOPSIS
           use Clone 'clone';

           my $data = {
              set => [ 1 .. 50 ],
              foo => {
                  answer => 42,
                  object => SomeObject->new,
              },
           };

           my $cloned_data = clone($data);

           $cloned_data->{foo}{answer} = 1;
           print $cloned_data->{foo}{answer};  # '1'
           print $data->{foo}{answer};         # '42'

       You can also add it to your class:

           package Foo;
           use parent 'Clone';
           sub new { bless {}, shift }

           package main;

           my $obj = Foo->new;
           my $copy = $obj->clone;

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a clone() method which makes recursive copies of
       nested hash, array, scalar and reference types, including tied
       variables and objects.

       clone() takes a scalar argument and duplicates it. To duplicate lists,
       arrays or hashes, pass them in by reference, e.g.

           my $copy = clone (\@array);

           # or

           my %copy = %{ clone (\%hash) };

SEE ALSO
       Storable's dclone() is a flexible solution for cloning variables,
       albeit slower for average-sized data structures. Simple and naive
       benchmarks show that Clone is faster for data structures with 3 or
       fewer levels, while dclone() can be faster for structures 4 or more
       levels deep.
