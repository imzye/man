RESIZEWIN(1)            FreeBSD General Commands Manual           RESIZEWIN(1)

NAME
     resizewin – update terminal size

SYNOPSIS
     resizewin [-z]

DESCRIPTION
     The resizewin utility queries the terminal emulator for the current
     window size and updates the size known to the kernel using the TIOCSWINSZ
     ioctl.

     The following options are available:

     -z     Do nothing unless the current kernel terminal size is zero.  This
            is useful when run from a user's profile (shell startup) scripts:
            querying the window size is required for serial lines, but not
            when logging in over the network, as protocols like TELNET or SSH
            already handle the terminal size by themselves.

     After a terminal window has been resized, running resizewin updates the
     kernel's window size to match the new size.

     resizewin is functionally similar to resize(1), which is part of the
     xterm(1) distribution.  However, resizewin only works with VT100/ANSI-
     compatible terminals and does not emit commands to set environment
     variables.

     The terminal is assumed to be VT100/ANSI compatible.  The VT100/ANSI
     escape sequences are supported by virtually all modern terminals,
     including xterm, konsole, gnome-terminal, iTerm, Terminal.app, and PuTTY.

     stty(1), tty(4)

HISTORY
     The resizewin command first appeared in FreeBSD 11.0.
