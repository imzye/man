         $ ca-bundle-for-firefox --file current.crt

DESCRIPTION
       This program is intended to generate the ca-bundle.crt file from the
       Certificate Authorities maintained in firefox.

       By default, the only firefox version that may be used will be present
       in the PATH environment variable.  However, the user may specify a
       different path with the --binary parameter.

REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
       None

OPTIONS
       Option names can be abbreviated to uniqueness and can be stated with
       singe or double dashes, and option values can be separated from the
       option name by a space or '=' (as with Getopt::Long). Option names are
       also case- sensitive.

       •   --help - This page.

       •   --binary - Use this firefox binary instead of the default firefox
           instance
