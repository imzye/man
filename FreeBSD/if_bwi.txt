BWI(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 BWI(4)

NAME
     bwi – Broadcom BCM43xx IEEE 802.11b/g wireless network driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device bwi
           device wlan
           device wlan_amrr
           device firmware

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_bwi_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The bwi driver provides support for Broadcom BCM43xx based PCI/CardBus
     network adapters.

     It supports station and monitor mode operation.  Only one virtual
     interface may be configured at any time.  For more information on
     configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

     This driver requires firmware to be loaded before it will work.  The
     ports/net/bwi-firmware-kmod port needs to be installed before ifconfig(8)
     will work.

HARDWARE
     The bwi driver supports Broadcom BCM43xx based wireless devices,
     including:

     The bwi driver uses the older v3 version of Broadcom's firmware.  While
     this older firmware does support most BCM43xx parts, the bwn(4) driver
     works better for the newer chips it supports.  You must use the bwi
     driver if you are using older Broadcom chipsets (BCM4301, BCM4303 and
     BCM4306 rev 2).  The v4 version of the firmware that bwn(4) uses does not
     support these chips.

EXAMPLES
     Join an existing BSS network (i.e., connect to an access point):

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev bwi0 inet 192.168.0.20 \
               netmask 0xffffff00

     Join a specific BSS network with network name “my_net”:

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev bwi0 ssid my_net up

     Join a specific BSS network with 64-bit WEP encryption:

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev bwi0 ssid my_net \
                   wepmode on wepkey 0x1234567890 weptxkey 1 up

HISTORY
     The bwi driver first appeared in FreeBSD 8.0.

AUTHORS
     The bwi driver was written for DragonFly by Sepherosa Ziehau and
     subsequently ported to FreeBSD.

BUGS
     Some card based on the BCM4306 and BCM4309 chips do not work properly on
     channel 1, 2 and 3.
