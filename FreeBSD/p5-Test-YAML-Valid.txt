NAME
       Test::YAML::Valid - Test for valid YAML

VERSION
       Version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
       This module lets you easily test the validity of YAML:

           use Test::More tests => 3;
           use Test::YAML::Valid;

           yaml_string_ok(YAML::Dump({foo => 'bar'}), 'YAML generates good YAML?');
           yaml_string_ok('this is not YAML, is it?', 'This one will fail');
           yaml_file_ok('/path/to/some/YAML', '/path/to/some/YAML is YAML');
           yaml_files_ok('/path/to/YAML/files/*', 'all YAML files are valid');

       You can also test with YAML::Syck instead of YAML by passing "-Syck" in
       the import list:

           use Test::YAML::Valid qw(-Syck);
           yaml_string_ok(...); # uses YAML::Syck::Load instead of YAML::Load

       It's up to you to make sure you have YAML::Syck if you specify the
       "-Syck" option, since it's an optional prerequisite to this module.  If
       it's requested but not found, a warning will be issued and YAML will be
       used instead.

       As of version 0.04, you can use any module you want in the same way;
       "-Tiny" for YAML::Tiny and "-XS" for YAML::XS.

EXPORT
       •   yaml_string_ok

       •   yaml_file_ok

       •   yaml_files_ok

FUNCTIONS
   yaml_string_ok($yaml, [$message])
       Test will pass if $yaml contains valid YAML (according to YAML.pm) and
       fail otherwise.  Returns the result of loading the YAML.

   yaml_file_ok($filename, [$message])
       Test will pass if $filename is a valid YAML file (according to YAML.pm)
       and fail otherwise.  Returns the result of loading the YAML.

   yaml_files_ok($file_glob_string, [$message])
       Test will pass if all files matching the glob $file_glob_string contain
       valid YAML.  If a file is not valid, the test will fail and no further
       files will be examined.

       Returns a list of all loaded YAML;
