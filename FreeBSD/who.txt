WHO(1)                  FreeBSD General Commands Manual                 WHO(1)

NAME
     who – display who is on the system

SYNOPSIS
     who [-abHmqsTu] [am I] [file]

DESCRIPTION
     The who utility displays information about currently logged in users.  By
     default, this includes the login name, tty name, date and time of login
     and remote hostname if not local.

     The options are as follows:

     -a      Equivalent to -bTu, with the exception that output is not
             restricted to the time and date of the last system reboot.

     -b      Write the time and date of the last system reboot.

     -H      Write column headings above the output.

     -m      Show information about the terminal attached to standard input
             only.

     -q      “Quick mode”: List the names and number of logged in users in
             columns.  All other command line options are ignored.

     -s      Show the name, line and time fields only.  This is the default.

     -T      Indicate whether each user is accepting messages.  One of the
             following characters is written:

             +  User is accepting messages.
             -  User is not accepting messages.
             ?  An error occurred.

     -u      Show idle time for each user in hours and minutes as hh:mm, ‘.’
             if the user has been idle less than a minute, and “old” if the
             user has been idle more than 24 hours.

     am I    Equivalent to -m.

     By default, who gathers information from the file /var/run/utx.active.
     An alternate file may be specified which is usually /var/log/utx.log (or
     /var/log/utx.log.[0-6] depending on site policy as utx.log can grow quite
     large and daily versions may or may not be kept around after compression
     by ac(8)).  The utx.log file contains a record of every login, logout,
     crash, shutdown and date change since utx.log was last truncated or
     created.

     If /var/log/utx.log is being used as the file, the user name may be empty
     or one of the special characters '|', '}' and '~'.  Logouts produce an
     output line without any user name.  For more information on the special
     characters, see getutxent(3).

ENVIRONMENT
     The COLUMNS, LANG, LC_ALL and LC_TIME environment variables affect the
     execution of who as described in environ(7).

FILES
     /var/run/utx.active
     /var/log/utx.log
     /var/log/utx.log.[0-6]

EXIT STATUS
     The who utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

SEE ALSO
