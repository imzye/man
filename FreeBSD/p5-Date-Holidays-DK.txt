NAME
       Date::Holidays::DK - Determine Danish public holidays

SYNOPSIS
         use Date::Holidays::DK;
         my ($year, $month, $day) = (localtime)[ 5, 4, 3 ];
         $year  += 1900;
         $month += 1;
         print "Woohoo" if is_dk_holiday( $year, $month, $day );

         my $h = dk_holidays($year);
         printf "Dec. 25th is named '%s'\n", $h->{'1225'};

DESCRIPTION
       Determines whether a given date is a Danish public holiday or not.

       This module is based on the simple API of Date::Holidays::UK, but
       implements a generalised date mechanism, that will work for all years
       since 1700, when Denmark adopted the Gregorian calendar.

Functions
       is_dk_holiday($year, $month, $date)
           Returns the name of the Holiday that falls on the given day, or
           undef if there is none.

       dk_holidays($year)
           Returns a hashref of all defined holidays in the year. Keys in the
           hashref are in 'mmdd' format, the values are the names of the
           holidays.

EXPORTS
       Exports is_dk_holiday() and dk_holidays() by default.
