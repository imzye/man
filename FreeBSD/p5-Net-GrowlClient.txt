NAME
       Net::GrowlClient - Perl implementation of Growl Network Notification
       Protocol (Client Part)

SYNOPSIS
               use Net::GrowlClient;

DESCRIPTION
       "Net::GrowlClient" provides an object interface to register
       applications and/or send notifications to Growl Servers using udp
       protocol.

CONSTRUCTOR
       init ( [ARGS] )
           Initialize a "Net::GrowlClient" Application with a Growl Server
           target.  The constructor takes arguments, these arguments are in
           key-value pairs.

           There is two groups of parameters, protocol parameters and
           registration parameters.

           Protocols parameters are:

            CLIENT_PEER_HOST       Remote server address or name
            CLIENT_PEER_PORT       Remote UDP port to use
            CLIENT_PASSWORD        Server password (if needed)
            CLIENT_CRYPT           Determine if we AES128 encrypt (boolean) (NOT IMPLEMENTED IN v < 0.10)
            CLIENT_TYPE_REGISTRATION Determine if we authenticate and how (0 md5 2 sha 4 noauth)
            CLIENT_TYPE_NOTIFICATION Determine if we authenticate and how (1 md5 3 sha 5 noauth)

           Registering an application within a Growl Server consist to tell
           the Server who we are, ie the name of the application, and what
           kind of message we will use.  As an example, the application
           "NetMonitor.pl" would register as "Perl NetMonitor" and tell the
           server that it will use "Standard Message" and "Alert Message" as
           kind of notifications.

           Registering the application is implicit (Constructor does it) but
           may be avoided if the application has already been registered
           within the Growl Server.

           Registering parameters are:

            CLIENT_APPLICATION_NAME        Name to register
            CLIENT_NOTIFICATION_LIST       List of notification type (A Reference to an array)
            CLIENT_SKIP_REGISTER           Do or Do not Register flag (boolean)

           You can also define some global notify() options wich could be
           override with the notify() method

            CLIENT_TITLE           Notification title
            CLIENT_STICKY          Sticky flag (boolean)
            CLIENT_NOTIFICATION    Default Notification to use
            CLIENT_MESSAGE         Message
            CLIENT_PRIORITY        Priority flag

METHOD
       notify(args)
           Once the object initialized, you can start sending notifications to
           the server with this method.  A Notification has a title and a
           message witch is related to one of the different kind of messages
           defined in the constructor. It also has a priority and a sticky
           flag. Priority is a value from -2 to 2, 0 is a normal priority.
           Sticky notifications does not desappear themselves on the server
           screen and needs a user interaction, this could be useful for
           important messages. But take care about not all notification
           display styles support sticky notification.  As an example the
           default Bezel style doesn't.

           Parameters:

            application    Application name #Be careful and see below
            title          The title
            message        The message
            priority       Priority flag
            sticky         Sticky flag
            notification   Kind of notification to use

DEFAULT VALUES
       Default values should be overwritten but some exists:

        CLIENT_TYPE_REGISTRATION       => 4 #noauth
        CLIENT_TYPE_NOTIFICATION       => 5 #noauth
        CLIENT_CRYPT                   => FALSE #Do not crypt ( AES128 is NOT IMPLEMENTED IN v < 0.10)
        CLIENT_PASSWORD                => '' #nullstring <=> nopassword
        CLIENT_PEER_HOST               => 'localhost'
        CLIENT_PEER_PORT               => 9887
        CLIENT_APPLICATION_NAME        => 'Net::GrowlClient'
        CLIENT_NOTIFICATION_LIST       => ['Net::GrowlClient Notification']
        CLIENT_NOTIFICATION            => First element of CLIENT_NOTIFICATION_LIST
        CLIENT_DEFAULT_TITLE           => 'Hello from Net::GrowlClient!'
        CLIENT_DEFAULT_MESSAGE         => "Yeah! It Works!\nThis is the default message."
        CLIENT_STICKY                  => FALSE
        CLIENT_SKIP_REGISTER           => FALSE
        CLIENT_PRIORITY                => 0 #Normal

       Notify Method use object parameters. They could be overwritten but keep
       in mind that application name and the notification list needs to be
       registered in order to be used with the notify() method.

COMMON USAGE
       Usually, you just want to see your message on the server screen and
       don't care about wich application is sending the message. In this case
       You just have to set a GrowlClient object which use the default values.
       The identity will be 'Net::GrowlClient' and the notification
       'Net::GrowlClient Notification'.  This is the minimal but sufficient
       usage.

        use Net::GrowlClient;

        my $growl = Net::GrowlClient->init(
               'CLIENT_PEER_HOST'      => 'server.example.com'
               ) or die "$!\n";

        $growl->notify(
               'title' => 'Notification title',
               'message'       => "first line\nsecond line"
               );

ADVANCED USAGE
       Using advanced features alow your application to have its own identity
       and notification list.  This make possible to set specific preferences
       for this application in the Growl Control Panel on the server.

       This example create a GrowlClient object for the application "Foo" with
       the server "server.example.com" using md5 auth.  Register this
       application 'Foo' with its notification list.  Send a sticky
       notification to with tho highest priority.

        use Net::GrowlClient;

        my $growl = Net::GrowlClient->init(
               'CLIENT_TYPE_REGISTRATION'      => 0, #md5 auth
               'CLIENT_TYPE_NOTIFICATION'      => 1, #md5 auth
               'CLIENT_CRYPT'                  => 0, #Do not crypt
               'CLIENT_PASSWORD'               => 'secret',
               'CLIENT_PEER_HOST'              => 'server.example.com',
               'CLIENT_APPLICATION_NAME'       => 'Foo',
               'CLIENT_NOTIFICATION_LIST'      => ['Foo Normal', 'Foo Alert'] #The default is the first 'Foo Normal'.
               ) or die "$!\n";

        $growl->notify(
               'title'         => 'Notification title',
               'message'       => "first line\nsecond line",
               'notification'  => 'Foo Alert', #Specify we do not use the default notification.
               'priority'      => 2,
               'sticky'        => 1
               );

       This example create a GrowlClient object for one or more application
       with are already registered and send messages to the server from
       Application 1 and Application 2.  This use sha256 auth method.

       use Net::GrowlClient;

        my $growl = Net::GrowlClient->init(
               'CLIENT_TYPE_REGISTRATION'      => 2, #sha auth
               'CLIENT_TYPE_NOTIFICATION'      => 3, #sha auth
               'CLIENT_PASSWORD'               => 'secret',
               'CLIENT_PEER_HOST'              => 'server.example.com',
               ) or die "$!\n";

        $growl->notify(
               'title'         => 'Notification title',
               'message'       => "first line\nsecond line",
               'notification'  => 'An Application 1 Notification',
               'application'   => 'Application 1 wich is registered'
               );

        $growl->notify(
               'title'         => 'Notification title',
               'message'       => "first line\nsecond line",
               'notification'  => 'An Application 2 Notification',
               'application'   => 'Application 2 wich is registered'
               );

MISSING THINGS
       There is still some capabilities missing in this growl network client
       protocol implementation.
