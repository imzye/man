NAME
     vn7to8

SYNOPSIS
     vn7to8 [-com composition character] [-v | -m | -l] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     vn7to8 converts files encoded in the Vietnamese 7-bit VIQR (VIetnamese
     Quoted Readable) format to the 8-bit VISCII (VIetnamese Standard Code for
     Information Interchange) data format.  The converted output is written to
     standard out.

     The following options are available:

     -com    specifies the composition character, default is "\"

     -v      sets the initial state to Vietnamese (default)

     -m      sets the initial state to English

     -l      sets the initial state to Literal

     If the input file name isn't specified, vn7to8 reads from standard input.
