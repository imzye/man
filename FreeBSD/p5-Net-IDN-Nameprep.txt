Net::IDN::Nameprep(3)                      User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Net::IDN::Nameprep - A Stringprep Profile for Internationalized Domain
       Names (RFC 3491)

SYNOPSIS
         use Net::IDN::Nameprep;
         $output = nameprep $input;

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements the nameprep specification, which describes how
       to prepare internationalized domain name (IDN) labels in order to
       increase the likelihood that name input and name comparison work in
       ways that make sense for typical users throughout the world.  Nameprep
       is a profile of the stringprep protocol and is used as part of a suite
       of on-the-wire protocols for internationalizing the Domain Name System
       (DNS).

FUNCTIONS
       This module implements a single function, "nameprep", which is exported
       by default.

       nameprep( $input [, AllowUnassigned => 1 ] )
           Processes $input according to the nameprep specification and
           returns the result.

           If $input contains characters not allowed for nameprep, it throws
           an exception (so use "eval" if necessary).

           This function takes the following optional parameter:

           AllowUnassigned
               (boolean) If set to a false value, unassigned code points in
               $input are not allowed.

               False MUST be used for stored strings.

               True MAY be used for queries.

               The default is true (backwards compatibility).
