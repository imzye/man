PCCARD(4)              FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual              PCCARD(4)

NAME
     pccard – PC Card bus driver

SYNOPSIS
     device pccard

DEPRECATION NOTICE
     This driver is scheduled for removal prior to the release of
     FreeBSD 13.0.

DESCRIPTION
     The pccard driver implements the PC Card bus.  The pccard driver supports
     all PC Card bridges in the system.

TUNABLES
     The driver supports the following tunable parameters, which may be added
     to /boot/loader.conf or set via the sysctl(8) command:
     hw.pccard.debug          Non-zero values cause more verbose information
                              to be printed when a 16-bit PC Card is inserted
                              or removed.
     hw.pccard.cis_debug      Non-zero value causes the CIS parsing of the
                              16-bit PC Card to be much more verbose and
                              include a complete CIS dump.

FILES
     /dev/pccard0.cis      This exclusive-use device will report all the CIS
                           chains present in a PC Card, if a 16-bit PC Card is
                           inserted in the slot.  Only one user at a time may
                           access the CIS.  The CIS is presented as the
                           relevant byte stream from the PC Card.  For CIS
                           tuples in Attribute Memory (the default), only the
                           even locations are presented (the ODD locations are
                           undefined per the standard).  For CIS tuples in
                           Common Memory, every byte is presented to the user.
                           Decoding of the CIS tuples is done via a userland
                           program.  All tuples are presented to the user.
