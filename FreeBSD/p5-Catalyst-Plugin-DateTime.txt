Catalyst::Plugin::DateTime(3)              User Contributed Perl Documentation

Catalyst::Plugin::DateTime - DateTime plugin for Catalyst.

SYNOPSIS
           # In your application class
           use Catalyst qw/DateTime/;


           # Use DateTime objects within your Catalyst app:
           my $dt = $c->datetime(); # will return a DateTime object with local date and time
           my $dt = $c->datetime(year => '2005', month => '01');

           $c->datetime->mdy(); # returns current date in mdy format (i.e. 01/01/2006)

           $c->dt(time_zone => 'Asia/Taipei'); # returns current date & time for argued time zone

METHODS
       datetime
           Returns a DateTime object.  If params are argued they will be
           passed to the "DateTime->new()" method.  Exceptions thrown by
           DateTime will be caught by Catalyst::Exception.

           If the argument list is empty, a DateTime object with the local
           date and time obtained via "DateTime->now()" will be returned.

           Uses "time_zone => local" as a default.

       dt  Alias to datetime.

DESCRIPTION
       This module's intention is to make the wonders of DateTime easily
       accesible within a Catalyst application via the Catalyst::Plugin
       interface.

       It adds the methods "datetime" and "dt" to the "Catalyst" namespace.
