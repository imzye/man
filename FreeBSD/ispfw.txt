NAME
     ispfw – Firmware for Qlogic FibreChannel SCSI Host Adapters

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following line in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device ispfw

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           ispfw_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     This trivial driver provides access to firmware sets for the Qlogic
     FibreChannel SCSI Host Adapters.  It may either be statically linked into
     the kernel, or loaded as a module.  In either case, the isp(4) driver
     will notice that firmware is available to be downloaded onto Qlogic cards
     (to replace the usually out of date firmware on the cards).  This will
     kick the f/w into getting unstuck.

AUTHORS
     This driver was written by Matthew Jacob.  Later improvement was done by
     Alexander Motin <mav@FreeBSD.org>.
