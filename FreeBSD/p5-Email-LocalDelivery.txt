Email::LocalDelivery(3)                    User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Email::LocalDelivery - Deliver a piece of email - simply

VERSION
       version 1.201

SYNOPSIS
         use Email::LocalDelivery;
         my @delivered_to = Email::LocalDelivery->deliver($mail, @boxes);

DESCRIPTION
       This module delivers an email to a list of mailboxes.

       Achtung!  You might be better off looking at Email::Sender, and at
       Email::Sender::Transport::Maildir and Email::Sender::Transport::Mbox.
       They are heavily used and more carefully monitored.

PERL VERSION
       This code is effectively abandonware.  Although releases will sometimes
       be made to update contact info or to fix packaging flaws, bug reports
       will mostly be ignored.  Feature requests are even more likely to be
       ignored.  (If someone takes up maintenance of this code, they will
       presumably remove this notice.)  This means that whatever version of
       perl is currently required is unlikely to change -- but also that it
       might change at any new maintainer's whim.

METHODS
   deliver
       This takes an email, as a plain string, and a list of mailboxes to
       deliver that mail to. It returns the list of boxes actually written to.
       If no boxes are given, it assumes the standard Unix mailbox. (Either
       $ENV{MAIL}, /var/spool/mail/you, /var/mail/you, or ~you/Maildir/)
