DESCRIPTION
       project_bin is used to call another project specific program under the
       current project as determined with project_dir.

       This program is not usually called directly.  Instead project_bin is
       symlinked as the name of the program to be executed.  project_bin then
       uses that name to determine the program to be called.  Alternatively
       the --project_bin-run option may be used to specify what to execute
       directly.

       This process enables multiple versions of a program to exist in
       different project directories.  The global path only contains a simple
       non-changing symlink which everyone can share.

EXAMPLE
       Assume "prog" is to be executed.  The shell uses the standard PATH
       environment variable and finds "prog" under
       $DIRPROJECT_PREFIX/bin/prog.  $DIRPROJECT_PREFIX/bin/prog is installed
       as a simple symlink to project_bin.  Thus the shell executes
       project_bin.

       Project_bin then determines the current project and sets the DIRPROJECT
       environment variable, which has the link to the current project area.
       See Dir::Project program_bin() for more details.

       Project_bin then uses the DIRPROJECT directory in combination with the
       DIRPROJECT_PATH to search for "prog", the name project_bin was invoked
       under.  "prog" is then executed with all of the arguments passed
       through project_bin.

       If project_bin couldn't determine the project or find the binary using
       DIRPROJECT_PATH, it tries to execute
       $DIRPROJECT_PREFIX/bin/"prog"__notfound which is generally a link to a
       version of "prog" that is the default for when outside a project.

       Instead of symlinking, you can make a script to call project_bin.  This
       allows the name of the script to differ from the name of the linked
       program, and also allows it to work on systems without symlinks.

         #!/usr/bin/perl -w
         exec 'project_bin', '--project_bin-run', 'name_of_script', @ARGV;

ARGUMENTS
       --debug
           The debug flag is passed to the application, and also enables
           debugging messages from project_bin itself.

       --project_bin-debug
           Strip this flag before passing to the application, and enable
           debugging.

       --project_bin-help
           Show this help message and exit.

       --project_bin-run program
           Specify the program name to be executed.  If not specified,
           presumes project_bin is symlinked, and $0 contains the name of the
           program to execute.  See the example above.

       --project_bin-version
           Show program version and exit.

       --project_bin-which
           Instead of running the program, print the resolved path, similar to
           the "which" program.  If you symlink project_bin to project_which,
           this will be the default action.

       ... All other arguments are passed through to the application.

ENVIRONMENT
       See Dir::Project for the list of relevant environment variables.
