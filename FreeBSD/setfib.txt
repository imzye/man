NAME
     setfib – execute a utility with an altered default network view

SYNOPSIS
     setfib [-F] fib utility [argument ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The setfib utility runs another utility with a different routing table.
     The table number fib will be used by default for all sockets started by
     this process or descendants.

ENVIRONMENT
     The PATH environment variable is used to locate the requested utility if
     the name contains no ‘/’ characters.

EXIT STATUS
     If utility is invoked, the exit status of setfib is the exit status of
     utility.

     An exit status of 126 indicates utility was found, but could not be
     executed.  An exit status of 127 indicates utility could not be found.

EXAMPLES
     Run netstat(1) to view the second routing table.

           setfib -F 1 netstat -rn
     or
           setfib 1 netstat -rn
     or
           setfib -1 netstat -rn

SEE ALSO
     setfib(2), setsockopt(2)

STANDARDS
     The setfib utility is a FreeBSD specific extension.  However, many
     UNIX-like systems have an equivalent function.
