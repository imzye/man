KYUA-HELP(1)            FreeBSD General Commands Manual           KYUA-HELP(1)

NAME
     kyua help – Shows usage information

SYNOPSIS
     kyua help [command]

DESCRIPTION
     The kyua help command provides interactive help on all supported commands
     and options.  If, for some reason, you happen to spot a discrepancy in
     the output of this command and this document, the command is the
     authoritative source of information.

     If no arguments are provided, the command prints the list of common
     options and the list of supported subcommands.

     If the command argument is provided to, this single argument is the name
     of a valid subcommand.  In that case, kyua help prints a textual
     description of the command, the list of common options and the list of
     subcommand-specific options.

EXIT STATUS
     The kyua help command always returns 0.

     Additional exit codes may be returned as described in kyua(1).
