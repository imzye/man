ATRUN(8)                FreeBSD System Manager's Manual               ATRUN(8)

NAME
     atrun – run jobs queued for later execution

SYNOPSIS
     atrun [-l load_avg] [-d]

DESCRIPTION
     Atrun runs jobs queued by at(1).

     The system crontab(5) file /etc/crontab must contain the line

     */5     *       *       *       *       root    /usr/libexec/atrun

     so atrun is invoked every five minutes.

     At every invocation, atrun starts all the jobs in the lowercase queues
     whose start time has elapsed.  In addition, if the load average over the
     last minute was less than the specified limit, then a maximum of one
     batch job (denoted by the uppercase queues) is started.

     Before starting a job, atrun checks the status of its owner's account
     with pam(3) and refuses to run the job if the account is unavailable,
     e.g., locked out or expired.

OPTIONS
     -l load_avg
             Specify a limiting load factor, over which batch jobs should not
             be run, instead of the default of 1.5 * number of active CPUs.

     -d      Debug; print error messages to standard error instead of using
             syslog(3).

WARNINGS
     For atrun to work, a cron(8) daemon must be running atrun periodically.

FILES
     /etc/pam.d/atrun  pam.conf(5) configuration file for atrun
     /var/at/jobs      Directory containing job files
     /var/at/spool     Directory containing output spool files

SEE ALSO

BUGS
     The functionality of atrun should be merged into cron(8).
