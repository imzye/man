NAME
     hv_utils – Hyper-V Utilities Driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in the
     system kernel configuration file:

           device hyperv

DESCRIPTION
     The hv_utils driver provides time keeping, shutdown and heartbeat
     functionality for FreeBSD guest partitions running on Hyper-V.  Hyper-V
     is a hypervisor-based virtualization technology from Microsoft.  The
     hv_utils driver is one of the core drivers required to be present in
     guest partitions running on Hyper-V.  This driver provides the following
     functionalities to guest partitions:

     (a) Time Keeping: The clock inside the guest partition will remain
     accurate by synchronizing to the clock on the virtualization server via
     Timesync service, and with the help of the pluggable time source device.

     (b) Integrated shutdown: Guest partitions running FreeBSD can be shut
     down from Hyper-V Manager console by using the "Shut down" command.

     (c) Heartbeat: This feature allows the virtualization server to detect
     whether the guest partition is running and responsive.
