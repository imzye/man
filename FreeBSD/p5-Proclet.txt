       proclet - foreman for perl

SYNOPSIS
         $ cat Procfile
         memd: memcached -v -p 11211

DESCRIPTION
       proclet is foreman for perl, manages Procfile-based applications.

       proclet does not support EXPORT yet.

RUNNING
       proclet start is used to run your application directly from the command
       line.

       The following options control how the application is run:

       -h, --help
           Display help message

       -c, --concurrency: Str
           The number of each process type to run. The value passed in should
           be in the format process=num,process=num

       -e, --env: Str
           An alternate environment file. You can specify more than one file
           by using: --env file1,file2.

       -f, --procfile: Str
           An alternate Procfile to load, implies -d at the Procfile root

       --color
           Colored log

       -p, --port: Num
           Port number which used as the base for this application. Should be
           a multiple of 1000

PROCFILE
       A Procfile should contain both a name for the process and the command
       used to run it.

         web: bundle exec thin start
         job: bundle exec rake jobs:work

ENVIRONMENT
       If a .env file exists in the current directory, the default environment
       will be read from it. This file should contain key/value pairs,
       separated by =, with one key/value pair per line.

         FOO=bar
         BAZ=qux

DEFAULT OPTIONS
       If a .foreman file exists in the current directory, default options
       will be read from it. This file should be in YAML format with the long
       option name as keys. Example:

         concurrency: alpha=0,bravo=1
         color: 1

PORT ASSIGNMENT
       As same as foreman, proclet starts to assign from port 5000 by default.
       and assigns them in blocks of 100 per service in the order used in your
       Procfile. You can specify an alternate starting port number with the -p
       option.
