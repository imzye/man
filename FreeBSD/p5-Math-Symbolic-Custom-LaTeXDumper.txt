Math::Symbolic::Custom::LaTeXDumper(3)     User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Math::Symbolic::Custom::LaTeXDumper - Math::Symbolic LaTeX output

SYNOPSIS
         use Math::Symbolic qw/parse_from_string/;
         use Math::Symbolic::Custom::LaTeXDumper;
         $term = parse_from_string(...);
         print $term->to_latex(...);

DESCRIPTION
       This class provides the to_latex() method for all Math::Symbolic trees.
       It is a rewrite of the to_latex() method that was supplied by
       "Math::Symbolic" prior to version 0.201.

       For details on how the custom method delegation model works, please
       have a look at the "Math::Symbolic::Custom" and
       "Math::Symbolic::Custom::Base" classes.

   EXPORT
       Please see the docs for "Math::Symbolic::Custom::Base" for details, but
       you should not try to use the standard Exporter semantics with this
       class.

SUBROUTINES
   to_latex
       It returns a LaTeX representation of the Math::Symbolic tree it is
       called on. The LaTeX is meant to be included in a LaTeX source
       document. It does not include an enclosing math environment.

       The method uses named parameter passing style. Valid parameters are:

       implicit_multiplication
           Used to turn on the '.' ("\cdot") operators for all
           multiplications.  Defaults to true, that is, the multiplication
           operators are not present.

       no_fractions
           Use '/' division operator instead of fractions.  Defaults to false,
           that is, use fractions. See also: "max_fractions" parameter.

       max_fractions
           Setting this parameter to a positive integer results in a
           limitation of the number of nested fractions. It defaults to 2.
           Setting this to 0 results in arbitrarily nested fractions. To
           disable fractions altogether, set the "no_fraction" parameter.

       exclude_signature
           By default, the method includes all variables' signatures in
           parenthesis if present. Set this to true to omit variable
           signatures.

       replace_default_greek
           By default, all variable names are outputted as LaTeX in a way that
           makes them show up exactly as they did in your code. If you set
           this option to true, Math::Symbolic will try to replace as many
           greek character names with the appropriates symbols as possible.

           Valid LaTeX symbols that are matched are:

             Lower case letters:
               alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, zeta, eta, theta,
               iota, kappa, lambda, mu, nu, xi, pi, rho, sigma,
               tau, upsilon, phi, chi, psi, omega

             Variant forms of small letters:
               varepsilon, vartheta, varpi, varrho, varsigma, varphi

             Upper case letters:
               Gamma, Delta, Theta, Lambda, Xi, Pi, Sigma, Upsilon, Phi,
               Psi, Omega

       variable_mappings
           Because not all variable names come out as you might want them to,
           you may use the 'variable_mappings' option to replace variable
           names in the output LaTeX stream with custom LaTeX. For example,
           the variable x_i should probably indicate an 'x' with a subscripted
           i.  The argument to variable_mappings needs to be a hash reference
           which contains variable name / LaTeX mapping pairs.

           If a variable is replaced in the above fashion, other options that
           modify the outcome of the conversion of variable names to LaTeX are
           ignored.

       subscript
           Set this option to a true value to have all underscores in variable
           names interpreted as subscripts. Once an underscore is encountered,
           the rest of the variable name is treated as subscripted. If
           multiple underscores are found, this mechanism works recursively.

           Defaults to "true". Set to a false value to turn this off. This is
           automatically turned off for variables that are mapped to custom
           LaTeX by the "variable_mappings" parameter.

       no_sqrt
           By default, the dumper tries to convert exponents of 1/2 (or 0.5)
           or anything numeric that ends up being 1/2 to a square root. If
           this gives inconvenient results, set this option to a true value to
           turn the heuristics off.
