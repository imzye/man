NAME
       Email::Folder - read all the messages from a folder as Email::Simple
       objects

VERSION
       version 0.860

SYNOPSIS
        use Email::Folder;

        my $folder = Email::Folder->new("some_file");

        print join "\n", map { $_->header("Subject") } $folder->messages;

METHODS
   new($folder, %options)
       Takes the name of a folder, and a hash of options

       If a 'reader' option is passed in then that is used as the class to
       read in messages with.

   messages
       Returns a list containing all of the messages in the folder.  Can only
       be called once as it drains the iterator.

   next_message
       acts as an iterator.  reads the next message from a folder.  returns
       false at the end of the folder

   bless_message($message)
       Takes a raw RFC822 message and blesses it into a class.

       By default this is an Email::Simple object but can easily be overridden
       in a subclass.

       For example, this simple subclass just returns the raw rfc822 messages,
       and exposes the speed of the parser.

        package Email::RawFolder;
        use base 'Email::Folder';
        sub bless_message { $_[1] };
        1;

   reader
       read-only accessor to the underlying Email::Reader subclass instance
