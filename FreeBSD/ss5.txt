NAME
       ss5 - A daemon that implements the SOCKS v4 and v5 protocol to execute
                proxy requests for a client

SYNOPSIS
       ss5 [options]

DESCRIPTION
       ss5 is a socks server that implements the SOCKS v4 and v5 protocol. As
       a proxy server, ss5 authenticates, profiles  and processes network
       requests for clients. It establishes connections to application hosts
       for client applications. When the client attempts to access the
       network, the client connects to the ss5 daemon instead of the
       application host.

       Following authentication, clients request that ss5 perform network
       activities for the client. The activities might include:

           CONNECT

           BIND

           UDP ASSOCIATE

       The ss5 protocol is independent of application protocols, and can
       assist with different networking services, including telnet, ftp,
       finger, whois, gopher, and WWW access.
       The ss5 daemon supports one authentication method:

          Username/Password -  Refer to ss5.passwd(5) or ss5.pam(5) for
                               additional information.



          The ss5 daemon supports two profiling methods:

             File -  Refer to ss5.conf(5) for additional information.

                                  Ldap -  Refer to ss5.conf(5) for additional
                                  information.



          ss5 can run:

             standalone -  the default

             prefork processes -  include the -n option (not supported in
             threaded mode)

             threaded   -  if your operating system supports POSIX threads.
                           Include the -t option to run ss5 in threaded mode.

OPTIONS
       Separate multiple options with white space.

       -b [host:port]|
              host:port specifies the host and the port number on that host on
              which ss5 runs, instead of the default port. When you omit host,
              ss5 uses 0.0.0.0 as the host value.

       -n  val
              Run multiple instances of ss5. -n option control the number of
              instances.

       -t     Run ss5 in threaded mode, if your operating system supports
              POSIX threads.

       -u  val
              Run ss5 with the specified user name.

       -v     Print a message containing the current ss5 version.

       -s     Use syslog instead of ss5.log log file.

       -c     Run syntax check for config file

       -m     Disable logging
