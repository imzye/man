NAME
       Math::Units - Unit conversion

SYNOPSIS
       use Math::Units qw(convert);

       my $out_value = convert($in_value, 'in unit', 'out unit');

DESCRIPTION
       The Math::Units module converts a numeric value in one unit of
       measurement to some other unit.  The units must be compatible, i.e.
       length can not be converted to volume.  If a conversion can not be made
       an exception is thrown.

       A combination chaining and reduction algorithm is used to perform the
       most direct unit conversion possible.  Units may be written in several
       different styles.  An abbreviation table is used to convert from common
       long-form unit names to the (more or less) standard abbreviations that
       the units module uses internally.  All multiplicative unit conversions
       are cached so that future conversions can be performed very quickly.

       Too many units, prefixes and abbreviations are supported to list here.
       See the source code for a complete listing.

TODO
       I beleive this module has great potential, if you have any ideas or
       patches feel free to submit them to rt.cpan.org.

       'units' program test like 'gunits'

       other tests

       POD about what units/abbr/etc can be used with the function

       general cleanup

       Mr. Fox's original TODO:

       1. There should be a set of routines for adding new unit formulas,
          reductions and conversions.

       2. Some conversions can be automatically generated from a reduction.
       (This
          has to be done carefully because conversions are bi-directional
       while
          reductions *must* be consistently uni-directional.)

       3. It would be nice to simplify the default conversions using the
          yet-to-be-written solution to #2.

       4. There are many units (several in the GNU unit program for example)
       that
          aren't defined here.  Since I was (un)fortunately born in the U.S.,
       I
          have a(n) (in)correct belief of what the standard units are.  Please
       let
          me know if I've messed anything up!

EXAMPLES
       print "5 mm == ", convert(5, 'mm', 'in'), " inches\n"; print "72
       degrees Farenheit == ", convert(72, 'F', 'C'), " degrees Celsius\n";
       print "1 gallon == ", convert(1, 'gallon', 'cm^3'), " cubic
       centimeters\n"; print "4500 rpm == ", convert(4500, 'rpm', 'Hz'), "
       Hertz\n";
