SERDI(1)                FreeBSD General Commands Manual               SERDI(1)

NAME
     serdi – read and write RDF syntax

SYNOPSIS
     serdi [-abefhlqv] [-c prefix] [-i syntax] [-o syntax] [-p prefix]
           [-r root] [-s string] input [base_uri]

DESCRIPTION
     serdi is a fast command-line utility for streaming and processing RDF
     data.  It reads an RDF document and writes the data to stdout, possibly
     transformed and/or in a different syntax.  By default, the input syntax
     is guessed from the file extension, and output is written in NTriples or
     NQuads.

     serdi can be used to check for syntax errors, convert from one syntax to
     another, pretty-print documents, or transform URIs and blank node IDs.

     The options are as follows:

     -a   Write ASCII output.  If this is enabled, all non-ASCII characters
          will be escaped, even if the output syntax allows them to be written
          in UTF-8.

     -b   Bulk output writing.  If this is enabled, output will be written a
          page at a time, rather than a byte at a time.

     -c prefix
          Chop prefix from matching blank node IDs.  This is typically used to
          revert the effects of -p.  For example, with prefix “doc01”, the
          blank node _:doc01b42 will be emitted as _:b42.

     -e   Eat input one character at a time, rather than a page at a time
          which is the default.  This is useful when reading from a pipe since
          output will be generated immediately as input arrives, rather than
          waiting until an entire page of input has arrived.  With this option
          serdi uses one page less memory, but will likely be significantly
          slower.

     -f   Fast and loose URI mode: preserve full URIs (without qualifying or
          making relative), and pass prefixed names through as-is.

     -h   Print the command line options.

     -i syntax
          Read input as syntax.  Case is ignored, valid values are: “NQuads”,
          “NTriples”, “TriG”, “Turtle”.

     -l   Lax (non-strict) parsing.  If this is enabled, recoverable syntax
          errors will print a warning, but parsing will proceed starting at
          the next statement if possible.  Note that data may be lost when
          using this option.

     -o syntax
          Write output as syntax.  Case is ignored, valid values are:
          “NQuads”, “NTriples”, “TriG”, “Turtle”.

     -p prefix
          Add prefix to blank node IDs.  This can be used to avoid clashes
          between blank node IDs in input documents.  The effects can be
          reversed in a later run with -c.  For example, with prefix “doc01”,
          the blank node _:b42 will be emitted as _:doc01b42.

     -q   Suppress all output except data.

     -r root
          Keep relative URIs within a root URI.  This will avoid creating any
          relative URI references with leading path segments like ../ that
          enter a parent of root.

          For example, if /home/you/file.ttl is written to the file
          /home/me/output.ttl using the destination's base URI, then it could
          be written as <../you/file.ttl>.  Setting -r file:///home/me/ would
          prevent references from “escaping” like this, so the above would
          instead be written as <file:///home/you/file.ttl>, since it can't be
          expressed relative to the root URI.

          This is useful for keeping relative references within some
          directory.

     -s string
          Parse string input instead of a file (terminates options).

     -v   Display version information and exit.

EXIT STATUS
     serdi exits with a status of 0, or non-zero if an error occurred.

EXAMPLES
     Pretty-print a document:
          serdi -o turtle file.ttl > out.ttl

     Print any errors:
          serdi file.ttl > /dev/null
