WLAN_TKIP(4)           FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual           WLAN_TKIP(4)

NAME
     wlan_tkip – TKIP and Michael crypto support for 802.11 devices

SYNOPSIS
     device wlan_tkip

DESCRIPTION
     The wlan_tkip module handles the TKIP and Michael cryptographic
     requirements of the WPA and 802.11i protocols.  It does encapsulation and
     decapsulation of TKIP-encoded 802.11 frames and optionally calculates the
     TKIP cipher and Michael MIC.  The wlan_tkip module is an 802.11
     cryptographic plugin module for use by the wlan(4) module.  This module
     is automatically loaded if a TKIP key is configured; typically by a WPA
     supplicant program such as wpa_supplicant, or a WPA authenticator program
     such as hostapd.  Should the underlying network device not be capable of
     doing the TKIP and/or Michael calculations in hardware, the wlan_tkip
     module will do the work.
