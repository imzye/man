NAME
       String::Parity - parity (odd/even/mark/space) handling functions

SYNOPSIS
        use String::Parity;
        use String::Parity qw(:DEFAULT /show/);

DESCRIPTION
       setEvenParity LIST
               Copies the elements of LIST to a new list and converts the new
               elements to strings of bytes with even parity. In array context
               returns the new list.  In scalar context joins the elements of
               the new list into a single string and returns the string.

       setOddParity LIST
               Like setEvenParity function, but converts to strings with odd
               parity.

       setSpaceParity LIST
               Like setEvenParity function, but converts to strings with space
               (High bit cleared) parity.

       setMarkParity LIST
               Like setEvenParity function, but converts to strings with mark
               (High bit set) parity.

       EvenBytes LIST
               Returns the number of even parity bytes in the elements of
               LIST.

       OddBytes LIST
               Returns the number of odd parity bytes in the elements of LIST.

       SpaceBytes LIST
               Returns the number of space parity bytes in the elements of
               LIST.

       MarkBytes LIST
               Returns the number of mark parity bytes in the elements of
               LIST.

       isEvenParity LIST
               Returns TRUE if the LIST contains no byte with odd parity,
               FALSE otherwise.

       isOddParity LIST
               Returns TRUE if the LIST contains no byte with even parity,
               FALSE otherwise.

       isSpaceParity LIST
               Returns TRUE if the LIST contains no byte with mark parity,
               FALSE otherwise.

       isMarkParity LIST
               Returns TRUE if the LIST contains no byte with space parity,
               FALSE otherwise.

       showParity LIST
               Like setEvenParity function, but converts bytes with even
               parity to 'e' and other bytes to 'o'.  The function showParity
               must be imported by a specialised import list.

       showMarkSpace LIST
               Like setEvenParity function, but converts bytes with space
               parity to 's' and other bytes to 'm'.  The function
               showMarkSpace must be imported by a specialised import list.

NOTES
       Don't use this module unless you have to communicate with some old
       device or protocol. Please make your application 8 bit clean and use
       the internationally standardised ISO-8859-1 character set.

SEE ALSO
       I don't know of any other modules that provide similar functionality.
       If you do, please let me know so I can update this section.
