CHROOTUID(8)            FreeBSD System Manager's Manual           CHROOTUID(8)


NAME
       chrootuid - run command in restricted environment

SYNOPSIS
       chrootuid newroot newuser command...

DESCRIPTION
       The chrootuid command sets up a restricted environment for executing
       command. Access to the file system is restricted to the newroot
       subtree; privileges are restricted to those of the newuser account
       (which must be a known account in the unrestricted environment).  The
       initial working directory is changed to newroot.

       chrootuid combines chroot(8) and su(1) into one program, so that there
       is no need to have commands such as /usr/bin/su in the restricted
       environment.

       Only the superuser can use the chrootuid command.

DIAGNOSTICS
       The exit status is 1 when chrootuid has a problem, otherwise the exit
       status is the exit status of command.

SEE ALSO
       chroot(8), su(1)

DIAGNOSTICS
       Problems are reported to the syslog daemon.
