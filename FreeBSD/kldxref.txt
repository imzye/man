KLDXREF(8)              FreeBSD System Manager's Manual             KLDXREF(8)

NAME
     kldxref – generate hints for the kernel loader

SYNOPSIS
     kldxref [-Rdv] [-f hintsfile] path ...

DESCRIPTION
     The kldxref utility is used to generate hint files which list modules,
     their version numbers, and the files that contain them.  These hints are
     used by the kernel loader to determine where to find a particular KLD
     module.

     A separate hint file is generated for each directory listed on the
     command line that contains modules.  If no hint records are generated for
     a particular directory, no hint file is created, and the preexisting hint
     file (if there was one in that directory) is removed.

     The following options are available:

     -R      Recurse into subdirectories.

     -d      Do not generate a hint file, but print module metadata on
             standard output.

     -f hintsfile
             Specify a different name for the hints files than linker.hints.

     -v      Operate in verbose mode.

EXAMPLES
     To build hint files for both standard and add-on modules:

           kldxref /boot/kernel /boot/modules

     To build hint files for all installed kernels:

           kldxref -R /boot
