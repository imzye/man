NAME
       Lugaru - free and open source ninja rabbit fighting game

DESCRIPTION
       Lugaru (pronounced Loo-GAH-roo) is a cross-platform third-person action
       game.  The main character, Turner, is an anthropomorphic rebel bunny
       rabbit with impressive combat skills. In his quest to find those
       responsible for slaughtering his village, he uncovers a far-reaching
       conspiracy involving the corrupt leaders of the rabbit republic and the
       starving wolves from a nearby den. Turner takes it upon himself to
       fight against their plot and save his fellow rabbits from slavery.
