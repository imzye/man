NAME
       XML::SAX::ExpatXS - Perl SAX 2 XS extension to Expat parser

SYNOPSIS
        use XML::SAX::ExpatXS;

        $handler = MyHandler->new();
        $parser = XML::SAX::ExpatXS->new( Handler => $handler );
        $parser->parse_uri($uri);
         #or
        $parser->parse_string($xml);

DESCRIPTION
       XML::SAX::ExpatXS is a direct XS extension to Expat XML parser. It
       implements Perl SAX 2.1 interface. See
       http://perl-xml.sourceforge.net/perl-sax/ for Perl SAX API description.
       Any deviations from the Perl SAX 2.1 specification are considered as
       bugs.

   Features
       The parser behavior can be changed by setting features.

        $parser->set_feature(FEATURE, VALUE);

       XML::SAX::ExpatXS provides these adjustable features:

       "http://xmlns.perl.org/sax/join-character-data"
           Consequent character data are joined (1, default) or not (0).

       "http://xmlns.perl.org/sax/ns-attributes"
           Namespace attributes are reported as common attributes (1, default)
           or not (0).

       "http://xmlns.perl.org/sax/xmlns-uris"
           When set on, xmlns and xmlns:* attributes are put into namespaces
           in a Perl SAX traditional way; xmlns attributes are in no namespace
           while xmlns:* attributes are in the "http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/"
           namespace. This feature is set to 1 by default.

       "http://xml.org/sax/features/xmlns-uris"
           This feature applies if and only if the
           "http://xmlns.perl.org/sax/xmlns-uris" feature is off. Then, xmlns
           and xmlns:* attributes are both put into no namespace (0, default)
           or into "http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/" namespace (1).

       "http://xmlns.perl.org/sax/locator"
           The document locator is updated (1, default) for ContentHadler
           events or not (0).

       "http://xmlns.perl.org/sax/recstring"
           A recognized string (the text string currently processed by this
           XML parser) is either maintained as
           $parser->{ParseOptions}{RecognizedString} (1) or not (0, default).

       "http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities"
           Controls whether this parser processes external general entities
           (1, default) or not (0).

       "http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities"
           Controls whether this parser processes external parameter entities
           including an external DTD subset (1) or not (0, default).

   Constructor Options
       Apart from features, the behavior of this parser can also be changed
       with options to the constructor.

       ParseParamEnt
            ParseParamEnt => 1

           This option meaning is exactly the same as the
           "http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities" feature.
           The option is supported only because of the compatibility with
           older versions of this module. Turned off by default.

       NoExpand
            NoExpand => 1

           No internal entities are expanded if this option is turned on.
           Turned off by default.

   Read-only Properties
       ExpatVersion
           This property returns a version of linked Expat library, for
           example expat_1.95.7.
