FCGIWRAP(8)             FreeBSD System Manager's Manual            FCGIWRAP(8)

NAME
       fcgiwrap - serve CGI applications over FastCGI

SYNOPSIS
       fcgiwrap [OPTIONS]


DESCRIPTION
       fcgiwrap is a simple server for running CGI applications over FastCGI.
       It hopes to provide clean CGI support to Nginx (and other web servers
       that may need it).


OPTIONS
       -c number
              Number of fcgiwrap processes to prefork.

       -f     Redirect STDERR output from executed CGI through FastCGI so it
              shows in the web server error log.  Otherwise it would be
              returned on fcgiwrap's STDERR, which could be redirected.  If
              running through spawn-fcgi, fcgiwrap's STDERR is sent to
              /dev/null, so this option provides a way to get that output
              back.

       -s socket_url
              A URL for the listen socket to bind to. By default fcgiwrap
              expects a listen socket to be passed on file descriptor 0,
              matching the FastCGI convention.  The recommended way to deploy
              fcgiwrap is to run it under a process manager that takes care of
              opening the socket. However, for simple configurations and one-
              off tests this option may be used. Valid socket_urls include
              unix:/path/to/unix/socket, tcp:dot.ted.qu.ad:port and
              tcp6:[ipv6_addr]:port.

       -p path
              Restrict execution to the given path. Repeated options will be
              merged.

       -h     Show a help message and exit.


ENVIRONMENT
       When running, fcgiwrap evaluates these environment variables set by the
       web server calling an fcgi-script. The variables DOCUMENT_ROOT and
       SCRIPT_NAME will be concatenated and the resulting executable run as
       CGI script wrapped as FastCGI, with the remainder after the script name
       available as PATH_INFO. To disable PATH_INFO mangling, set up your web
       server to pass SCRIPT_FILENAME, which should contain the complete path
       to the script. Then PATH_INFO will not be modified.

       DOCUMENT_ROOT
              directory which the script resides in
       SCRIPT_NAME
              actual executable
       SCRIPT_FILENAME
              complete path to CGI script. When set, overrides DOCUMENT_ROOT
              and SCRIPT_NAME


EXAMPLE
       The fastest way to see fcgiwrap do something is to launch it at the
       command line like this:
       fcgiwrap -s unix:/var/run/fcgiwrap.sock
       Apart from potential permission problems etc., it should be ready to
       accept FastCGI requests and run CGI scripts.

       Most probably you will want to launch fcgiwrap by spawn-fcgi using a
       configuration like this:

       FCGI_SOCKET=/var/run/fcgiwrap.sock
       FCGI_PROGRAM=/usr/sbin/fcgiwrap
       FCGI_USER=nginx
       FCGI_GROUP=www
       FCGI_EXTRA_OPTIONS="-M 0700"
       ALLOWED_ENV="PATH"

       Nginx can be configured to have the arbitrary CGI cgit run as FastCGI
       as follows:

       location / {
            fastcgi_param DOCUMENT_ROOT /var/www/localhost/htdocs/cgit/;
            fastcgi_param SCRIPT_NAME   cgit;
            fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/fastcgi.sock;
       }
