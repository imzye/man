AC(8)                   FreeBSD System Manager's Manual                  AC(8)

NAME
     ac – connect time accounting

SYNOPSIS
     ac [-dp] [-t tty] [-w wtmp] [users ...]

DESCRIPTION
     If the file /var/log/utx.log exists, a record of individual login and
     logout times are written to it by login(1) and init(8), respectively.
     The ac utility examines these records and writes the accumulated connect
     time (in hours) for all logins to the standard output.

     The options are as follows:

     -d         Display the connect times in 24 hour chunks.

     -p         Print individual users' totals.

     -t tty     Only do accounting logins on certain ttys.  The tty
                specification can start with '!' to indicate not this tty and
                end with '*' to indicate all similarly named ttys.  Multiple
                -t flags may be specified.

     -w wtmp    Read connect time data from wtmp instead of the default file,
                /var/log/utx.log.

     users ...  Display totals for the given individuals only.

     If no arguments are given, ac displays the total connect time for all
     accounts with login sessions recorded in utx.log.

     The default utx.log file will increase without bound unless it is
     truncated.  It is normally truncated by the daily scripts run by cron(8),
     which rename and rotate the utx.log files, keeping a week's worth of data
     on hand.  No login or connect time accounting is performed if
     /var/log/utx.log does not exist.

FILES
     /var/log/utx.log  connect time accounting file

EXIT STATUS
     The ac utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Allow times recorded in modems to be charged out at a different rate than
     other:

           ac -p -t "ttyd*" > modems
           ac -p -t "!ttyd*" > other

SEE ALSO

HISTORY
     An ac command appeared in Version 5 AT&T UNIX.  This version of ac was
     written for NetBSD 0.9A from the specification provided by various
     systems' manual pages.
