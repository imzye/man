NAME
     gssapi – Generic Security Services API

LIBRARY
     GSS-API Library (libgssapi, -lgssapi)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <gssapi/gssapi.h>

DESCRIPTION
     The Generic Security Service Application Programming Interface provides
     security services to its callers, and is intended for implementation atop
     a variety of underlying cryptographic mechanisms.  Typically, GSS-API
     callers will be application protocols into which security enhancements
     are integrated through invocation of services provided by the GSS-API.
     The GSS-API allows a caller application to authenticate a principal
     identity associated with a peer application, to delegate rights to a
     peer, and to apply security services such as confidentiality and
     integrity on a per-message basis.

     There are four stages to using the GSS-API:

     a)  The application acquires a set of credentials with which it may prove
         its identity to other processes.  The application's credentials vouch
         for its global identity, which may or may not be related to any local
         username under which it may be running.

     b)  A pair of communicating applications establish a joint security
         context using their credentials.  The security context is a pair of
         GSS-API data structures that contain shared state information, which
         is required in order that per-message security services may be
         provided.  Examples of state that might be shared between
         applications as part of a security context are cryptographic keys,
         and message sequence numbers.  As part of the establishment of a
         security context, the context initiator is authenticated to the
         responder, and may require that the responder is authenticated in
         turn.  The initiator may optionally give the responder the right to
         initiate further security contexts, acting as an agent or delegate of
         the initiator.  This transfer of rights is termed delegation, and is
         achieved by creating a set of credentials, similar to those used by
         the initiating application, but which may be used by the responder.

         To establish and maintain the shared information that makes up the
         security context, certain GSS-API calls will return a token data
         structure, which is an opaque data type that may contain
         cryptographically protected data.  The caller of such a GSS-API
         routine is responsible for transferring the token to the peer
         application, encapsulated if necessary in an application protocol.
         On receipt of such a token, the peer application should pass it to a
         corresponding GSS-API routine which will decode the token and extract
         the information, updating the security context state information
         accordingly.

     c)  Per-message services are invoked to apply either:

         integrity and data origin authentication, or confidentiality,
         integrity and data origin authentication to application data, which
         are treated by GSS-API as arbitrary octet-strings.  An application
         transmitting a message that it wishes to protect will call the
         appropriate GSS-API routine (gss_get_mic or gss_wrap) to apply
         protection, specifying the appropriate security context, and send the
         resulting token to the receiving application.  The receiver will pass
         the received token (and, in the case of data protected by
         gss_get_mic, the accompanying message-data) to the corresponding
         decoding routine (gss_verify_mic or gss_unwrap) to remove the
         protection and validate the data.

     d)  At the completion of a communications session (which may extend
         across several transport connections), each application calls a GSS-
         API routine to delete the security context.  Multiple contexts may
         also be used (either successively or simultaneously) within a single
         communications association, at the option of the applications.

GSS-API ROUTINES
     This section lists the routines that make up the GSS-API, and offers a

     Individual GSS-API implementations may augment these routines by
     providing additional mechanism-specific routines if required
     functionality is not available from the generic forms.  Applications are
     encouraged to use the generic routines wherever possible on portability
     grounds.
