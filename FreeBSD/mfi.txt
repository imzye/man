MFI(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 MFI(4)

NAME
     mfi – LSI MegaRAID SAS driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device pci
           device mfi

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           mfi_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     This driver is for LSI's next generation PCI Express SAS RAID
     controllers.  Access to RAID arrays (logical disks) from this driver is
     provided via /dev/mfid? device nodes.  A simple management interface is
     also provided on a per-controller basis via the /dev/mfi? device node.

     The mfi name is derived from the phrase "MegaRAID Firmware Interface",
     which is substantially different than the old "MegaRAID" interface and
     thus requires a new driver.  Older SCSI and SATA MegaRAID cards are
     supported by amr(4) and will not work with this driver.

     Two sysctls are provided to tune the mfi driver's behavior when a request
     is made to remove a mounted volume.  By default the driver will disallow
     any requests to remove a mounted volume.  If the sysctl
     dev.mfi.%d.delete_busy_volumes is set to 1, then the driver will allow
     mounted volumes to be removed.

     A tunable is provided to adjust the mfi driver's behaviour when attaching
     to a card.  By default the driver will attach to all known cards with
     high probe priority.  If the tunable hw.mfi.mrsas_enable is set to 1,
     then the driver will reduce its probe priority to allow mrsas to attach
     to the card instead of mfi.

     mfi does not provide ATA TRIM support.  Refer to mrsas if TRIM support is
     required.
