BUS_GET_RESOURCE(9)    FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual   BUS_GET_RESOURCE(9)

NAME
     bus_get_resource – read a resource range/value with a given resource ID

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <sys/bus.h>
     #include <sys/rman.h>

     int
     bus_get_resource(device_t dev, int type, int rid, rman_res_t *startp,
         rman_res_t *countp);

DESCRIPTION
     The bus_get_resource() function reads the range or value of the resource
     type, rid pair and stores it in the startp and countp arguments.

     The arguments are as follows:

     dev         The device to read the resource from.

     type        The type of resource you want to read.  It is one of:

                 SYS_RES_IRQ         for IRQs
                 SYS_RES_DRQ         for ISA DMA lines
                 SYS_RES_MEMORY      for I/O memory
                 SYS_RES_IOPORT      for I/O ports

     rid         A bus-specific handle that identifies the resource being
                 read.

     startp      A pointer to the start address of this resource.

     countp      A pointer to the length of the resource.  For example, the
                 size of the memory in bytes.

RETURN VALUES
     Zero is returned on success, otherwise an error is returned.
