PTHREAD_CREATE(3)      FreeBSD Library Functions Manual      PTHREAD_CREATE(3)

NAME
     pthread_create – create a new thread

LIBRARY
     POSIX Threads Library (libpthread, -lpthread)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <pthread.h>

     int
     pthread_create(pthread_t *restrict thread,
         const pthread_attr_t *restrict attr, void *(*start_routine)(void *),
         void *restrict arg);

DESCRIPTION
     The pthread_create() function is used to create a new thread, with
     attributes specified by attr, within a process.  If attr is NULL, the
     default attributes are used.  If the attributes specified by attr are
     modified later, the thread's attributes are not affected.  Upon
     successful completion pthread_create() will store the ID of the created
     thread in the location specified by thread.

     The thread is created executing start_routine with arg as its sole
     argument.  If the start_routine returns, the effect is as if there was an
     implicit call to pthread_exit() using the return value of start_routine
     as the exit status.  Note that the thread in which main() was originally
     invoked differs from this.  When it returns from main(), the effect is as
     if there was an implicit call to exit() using the return value of main()
     as the exit status.

     The signal state of the new thread is initialized as:

           •   The signal mask is inherited from the creating thread.

           •   The set of signals pending for the new thread is empty.

RETURN VALUES
     If successful, the pthread_create() function will return zero.  Otherwise
     an error number will be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     The pthread_create() function can return any of the following errors:

     [ENOMEM]           The system lacked the necessary resources to create
                        another thread.

     [EAGAIN]           The system-imposed limit on the total number of
                        threads in a process [PTHREAD_THREADS_MAX] would be
                        exceeded.

     [EAGAIN]           The RACCT_NTHR limit would be exceeded; see racct(2).

     [EPERM]            The caller does not have permission to set the
                        scheduling parameters or scheduling policy.

     [EINVAL]           A value specified by attr is invalid.

     [EDEADLK]          The CPU set specified by attr would prevent the thread
                        from running on any CPU.

     [EFAULT]           The stack base specified by attr is invalid, or the
                        kernel was unable to put required initial data on the
                        stack.
