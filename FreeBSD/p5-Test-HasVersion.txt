NAME
       Test::HasVersion - Check Perl modules have version numbers

SYNOPSIS
       "Test::HasVersion" lets you check a Perl module has a version number in
       a "Test::Simple" fashion.

         use Test::HasVersion tests => 1;
         pm_version_ok("M.pm", "Valid version");

       Module authors can include the following in a t/has_version.t file and
       let "Test::HasVersion" find and check all installable PM files in a
       distribution.

         use Test::More;
         eval "use Test::HasVersion";
         plan skip_all =>
              'Test::HasVersion required for testing for version numbers' if $@;
         all_pm_version_ok();

DESCRIPTION
       Do you wanna check that every one of your Perl modules in a
       distribution has a version number? You wanna make sure you don't forget
       the brand new modules you just added?  Well, that's the module you have
       been looking for.  Use it!

       Do you wanna check someone else's distribution to make sure the author
       have not committed the sin of leaving Perl modules without a version
       that can be used to tell if you have this or that feature?
       "Test::HasVersion" is also for you, nasty little fellow.

       There's a script test_version which is installed with this
       distribution. You may invoke it from within the root directory of a
       distribution you just unpacked, and it will check every .pm file in the
       directory and under lib/ (if any).

         $ test_version

       You may also provide directories and files as arguments.

         $ test_version *.pm lib/ inc/
         $ test_version .

       (Be warned that many Perl modules in a t/ directory do not receive
       versions because they are not used outside the distribution.)

       Ok. That's not a very useful module by now.  But it will be. Wait for
       the upcoming releases.

   FUNCTIONS
       PRIVATE _pm_version
             $v = _pm_version($pm);

           Parses a PM file and return what it thinks is $VERSION in this
           file. (Actually implemented with "use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;
           MM->parse_version($file)".)  $pm is the filename (eg.,
           lib/Data/Dumper.pm).

       pm_version_ok
             pm_version_ok('Module.pm');
             pm_version_ok('M.pm', 'Has valid version');

           Checks to see if the given file has a valid version. Actually a
           valid version number is defined and not equal to 'undef' (the
           string) which is return by "_pm_version" if a version cannot be
           determined.

       all_pm_version_ok
             all_pm_version_ok();
             all_pm_version_ok(@PM_FILES);

           Checks every given file and .pm files found under given directories
           to see if they provide valid version numbers. If no argument is
           given, it defaults to check every file *.pm in the current
           directory and recurses under the lib/ directory (if it exists).

           If no test plan was setted, "Test::HasVersion" will set one after
           computing the number of files to be tested. Otherwise, the plan is
           left untouched.

       PRIVATE _list_pm_files
             @pm_files = _list_pm_files(@dirs);

           Returns all PM files under the given directories.

       all_pm_files
             @files = all_pm_files()
             @files = all_pm_files(@files_and_dirs);

           Implements finding the Perl modules according to the semantics of
           the previous function "all_pm_version_ok".

USAGE
       Other usage patterns besides the ones given in the synopsis.

         use Test::More tests => $num_tests;
         use Test::HasVersion;
         pm_version_ok($file1);
         pm_version_ok($file2);

       Obviously, you can't plan twice.

         use Test::More;
         use Test::HasVersion;
         plan tests => $num_tests;
         pm_version_ok($file);

       "plan" comes from "Test::More".

         use Test::More;
         use Test::HasVersion;
         plan 'no_plan';
         pm_version_ok($file);

       "no_plan" is ok either.
