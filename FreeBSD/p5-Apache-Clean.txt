NAME
       Apache::Clean - interface into HTML::Clean for mod_perl 2.0

SYNOPSIS
       httpd.conf:

         PerlModule Apache::Clean

         Alias /clean /usr/local/apache2/htdocs
         <Location /clean>
           PerlOutputFilterHandler Apache::Clean

           PerlSetVar CleanOption shortertags
           PerlAddVar CleanOption whitespace
         </Location>

DESCRIPTION
       Apache::Clean uses HTML::Clean to tidy up large, messy HTML, saving
       bandwidth.

       Only documents with a content type of "text/html" are affected - all
       others are passed through unaltered.

       For more information, see

         http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2003/04/17/filters.html

OPTIONS
       Apache::Clean supports few options - all of which are based on options
       from HTML::Clean.  Apache::Clean will only tidy up whitespace (via
       $h->strip) and will not perform other options of HTML::Clean (such as
       browser compatibility).  See the HTML::Clean manpage for details.

       CleanLevel
           sets the clean level, which is passed to the level() method in
           HTML::Clean.

             PerlSetVar CleanLevel 9

           CleanLevel defaults to 1.

       CleanOption
           specifies the set of options which are passed to the options()
           method in HTML::Clean - see the HTML::Clean manpage for a complete
           list of options.

             PerlSetVar CleanOption shortertags
             PerlAddVar CleanOption whitespace

           CleanOption has no default.

NOTES
       This is alpha software, and as such has not been tested on multiple
       platforms or environments.

FEATURES/BUGS
       probably lots - this is the preliminary port to mod_perl 2.0
