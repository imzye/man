NAME
       nip2 - image processing with the VIPS library


SYNOPSIS
       nip2 [filename1 ...]
       nip2 -s filename [arg1 ...]
       nip2 -e expression [arg1 ...]


DESCRIPTION
       nip2 (for New Image Processing) is a tool for manipulating images using
       the VIPS image processing library.

       There are three principal modes:

       nip2 [filename1 ...]
         start in GUI mode, loading the named files

       nip2 -e expression [arg1 ...]
       nip2 --expression=EXPRESSION [arg1 ...]
         start in no-GUI mode; set main = expression, set list argv to
         ["filename", "arg1", "arg2", ...], set argc to length of list; print
         the value of symbol "main" to stdout; exit

       nip2 -s filename [arg1 ...]
       nip2 --script=FILENAME [arg1 ...]
         start in no-GUI mode; read in filename as a set of definitions,
         set list argv to ["filename", "arg1", "arg2", ...], set argc to
         length of list; print the value of symbol "main" to stdout; exit;
         useful for running nip2 as an interpreter on unix

       You can use -o to direct output to a file rather than stdout.

       -o filename
       --output=FILENAME
         the value of main is written to the named file. If main is a
         list, the filename is incremented between objects. You can use
         the suffix to specify the format and options to write in

       Other options provide finer control over startup and shutdown. If you
       need to do something strange, don't use -e/-s, use these in
       combination.

       -b
       --batch
         batch (ie. non-GUI) mode

       -m
       --no-load-menus
         don't load menus, for faster startup

       -a
       --no-load-args
         don't load extra command-line arguments

       -w
       --stdin-ws
         load stdin as a workspace

       -d
       --stdin-def
         load stdin as a set of definitions

       -p
       --print-main
         print the value of main on exit. nip2 will check for a top-level
         symbol called main, and also check each workspace for a main

       Finally some other options are useful for debugging, timing and for
       generating strings for internationalisation.

       -V
       --verbose
         produce verbose error messages: handy for debugging in batch mode

       -i
       --i18n
         output strings from .def files for internationalisation

       -v
       --version
         print version information

       -c
       --benchmark
         benchmark: no GUI, just start up and shut down

       -t
       --time-save
         time saves: after every image save a popup tells you the time the
         save took in seconds

       -T
       --test
         test: start up (including any arg processing), test for any errors,
         and exit with an error code if any occured. Useful for running
         automated tests.

       -x PREFIX
       --prefix=PREFIX
         set install prefix: start up as if nip2 had been installed to PREFIX.
         Useful for running automated tests without installing the thing.


EXAMPLES
         nip2 fred.jpg

       Start nip2, loading fred.jpg.

         nip2 -e "2 + 2"

       Prints 4 to stdout.

         nip2 -e "99 + Image_file argv?1" -o result.png fred.jpg

       Load argv1 (fred.jpg), add 99, output to result.png.

         nip2 -e "Matrix [[1,2],[4,5]] ** -1" -o poop.mat

       Invert the 2x2 matrix and write the result to poop.mat.
