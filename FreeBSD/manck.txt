MANCK(1)                FreeBSD General Commands Manual               MANCK(1)

NAME
     manck – check manual pages

SYNOPSIS
     manck [-d] [-h -|-?] [-help] [-bin path] [-exclude_files file]
           [-exclude_pages file] [-u=section] [-i -|-include includepath]
           [-xref] [-files] [-M manpath] [manpages ...]

DESCRIPTION
     Manck check manual pages. Currently supported section FILES, NAME, SEE
     ALSO, and SYNOPSIS.  Manck checks all man pages in the directory
     /usr/share/man if no manpages defined. See option -M


     The options are as follows:


           -d -|-debug
                       Be more verbose about what will be done.  For a single
                       -d option, print more errors and warnings. If the
                       option -d has been specified at least twice, print
                       verbose errors and warnings.  One -d is recommend for a
                       thorough review.


           -h -|-?

           -help       Give a help on the command usage and exit.


           -bin path   Look for binaries in path without a corresponding
                       manpage. Colons in path are allowed. Default
                       /bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin


           -exclude_files file
                       file contains a list of missing files that are ``ok''
                       to be missing in the FILES section.


           -exclude_pages file
                       file contains a list of missing manpages that are
                       ``ok'' to be missing.


           -files      Scan entire man page for file names that have been
                       specified with the ``.Pa'' or ``.It Pa'' macros. This
                       option is independent from section FILES, so it is
                       possible that manck may report errors twice.


           -i -|-include includepath
                       Path where include files located.  Colons in
                       includepath are allowed. Default
                       /usr/include:/usr/local/include:/usr/X11/include.


           -u=section  Don't check section section.


           -xref       Scan entire man page for references to other man pages
                       that have been referenced with the ``.Xr'' or ``.Fn''
                       macros. This option is independent from the SEE ALSO
                       section, so it is possible that manck may report errors
                       twice.


           -M manpath  Use manpath as the directory where manpages are
                       located. Colons in manpath are allowed. Default
                       /usr/share/man


EXAMPLES
           $ manck -bin

     Test if all binaries in /bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin have their own
     manpages


           $ manck /usr/share/man/man1/z*

     Check all manpages with leading 'z' in /usr/share/man/man1.


           $ manck

     Recursively check all manpages in /usr/share/man.


FILES
     /usr/share/man      directory for manual pages.


ENVIRONMENT
     $MANPATH            directories for searching cross references.


SEE ALSO
     man(1), hier(7).
