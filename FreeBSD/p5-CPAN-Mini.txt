DESCRIPTION
       This simple shell script just updates (or creates) a miniature CPAN
       mirror as described in CPAN::Mini.

PERL VERSION
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It
       should work on any version of perl released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made
       that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version
       may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       By default, "minicpan" will read a configuration file to get
       configuration information.  The file is a simple set of names and
       values, as in the following example:

        local:  /home/rjbs/mirrors/minicpan/
        remote: http://your.favorite.cpan/cpan/
        exact_mirror: 1

       "minicpan" tries to find a configuration file through the following
       process.  It takes the first defined it finds:

       •   Use the value specified by "-C" on the command line

       •   Use the value in the "CPAN_MINI_CONFIG" environment variable

       •   Use ~/.minicpanrc

       •   Use CPAN/Mini/minicpan.conf

       If the selected file does not exist, "minicpan" does not keep looking.

       You can override this process with a "config_file" method in your
       subclass.

       See "CPAN::Mini" for a full listing of available options.

TO DO
       Improve command-line options.
