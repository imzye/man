LIBBSDXML(3)           FreeBSD Library Functions Manual           LIBBSDXML(3)

NAME
     libbsdxml – eXpat XML parser library

SYNOPSIS
     #include <bsdxml.h>

DESCRIPTION
     The libbsdxml library is a verbatim copy of the eXpat XML library version
     2.2.9.

     The libbsdxml library is intended to be used within the FreeBSD base
     system only.  Use of the libbsdxml library for other purposes is not
     supported and discouraged.

     To avoid version and autoconfiguration issues, the library has been
     renamed to libbsdxml rather than retain the original eXpat library and
     include file names to prevent confusion and autoconfiguration issues for
     3rd party software.

     For full documentation, please see the eXpat webpage at
     http://www.libexpat.org/.

AUTHORS

     Subsequently eXpat maintenance and development been taken up by a group
     of people under the leadership of Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.com>, Paul
     Prescod, and Clark Cooper.
