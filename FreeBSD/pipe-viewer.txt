CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
   api_host
       Hostname of an invidious instance. When set to "auto", a random
       invidious instance is selected on-demand.

       List of public invidious instances:

           https://api.invidious.io/

       Tor instances are also supported if the "socks5://127.0.0.1:9050" Tor
       proxy is available and the Perl module LWP::Protocol::socks is
       installed.

   auto_captions
       When set to 1, auto-generated captions will be retrieved. By default,
       auto-generated captions are ignored.

   audio_quality
       The preferred quality for the audio-track:

           best        # best audio quality available (<=192kbps)
           medium      # medium audio quality (<=128kbps)
           low         # low audio quality (<=50kbps)

       The option can also be set to a numeric value N in order to select an
       audio-track with <= Nkbps.

   autoplay_mode
       Enable autoplay mode, which will continuously play related videos.

   bypass_age_gate_native
       Bypass age-restricted videos, using our internal method.

       However, these streaming URLs are heavily throttled by YouTube.

       When this option is disabled, a fallback method will be used instead
       ("yt-dlp"/"youtube-dl" or invidious instances).

   bypass_age_gate_with_proxy
       Bypass age-restricted videos using an YouTube Account Proxy.

   cache_dir
       Cache directory where to save temporary files.

   colors
       Use colors for text.

   comments_order
       The sorting order for comments. Valid values: "top", "new".

   confirm
       Display a confirmation message after each video played.

   convert_cmd
       Command to convert videos.

       Default value:

           "ffmpeg -i *IN* *OUT*"

       *IN* gets replaced with the input file.

       *OUT* gets replaced with the output file.

   convert_to
       Format to convert each downloaded video into. (e.g.: "mp3").

   cookie_file
       Load cookies from a file. Useful to overcome the "429: Too Many
       Requests" issue.

       The file must be a "# Netscape HTTP Cookie File". Same format as
       "youtube-dl" requires.

       See also:

           https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl#how-do-i-pass-cookies-to-youtube-dl

   copy_caption
       When downloading a video, copy the closed-caption (if any) into the
       same folder with the video.

       If "merge_into_mkv" and "merge_with_captions" are both enabled, there
       is no need to enable this option.

   custom_layout_format
       An array of hash values specifying a custom layout for video results.

           align       # "left" or "right"
           color       # any color name supported by Term::ANSIColor
           text        # the actual text
           width       # width allocated for the text

       The value for "width" can be either a number of characters (e.g.: 20)
       or can be a percentage of the terminal width (e.g.: "15%").

       The special tokens for "text" are listed in:

           pipe-viewer --tricks

       For better formatting, it's highly recommended to install
       Unicode::GCString or Text::CharWidth.
