NAME
       Test::Compile - Assert that your Perl files compile OK.

SYNOPSIS
           use Test::Compile qw();

           my $test = Test::Compile->new();
           $test->all_files_ok();
           $test->done_testing();

DESCRIPTION
       "Test::Compile" lets you check the whether your perl modules and
       scripts compile properly, results are reported in standard
       "Test::Simple" fashion.

       The basic usage - as shown above, will locate your perl files and test
       that they all compile.

       Module authors can (and probably should) include the following in a
       t/00-compile.t file and have "Test::Compile" automatically find and
       check all Perl files in a module distribution:

           #!perl
           use strict;
           use warnings;
           use Test::Compile qw();

           my $test = Test::Compile->new();
           $test->all_files_ok();
           $test->done_testing();

METHODS
       new()
           The constructor, which actually returns a Test::Compile::Internal
           object.  This gives you access to all the methods provided by
           "Test::Compile::Internal", including those listed below.

       all_files_ok(@dirs)
           Looks for perl files and tests them all for compilation errors.

           See "all_files_ok(@dirs)" in Test::Compile::Internal for the full
           documentation.

       done_testing()
           Declares that you are done testing, no more tests will be run after
           this point.

       diag(@msgs)
           Prints out the given @msgs. Like print, arguments are simply
           appended together.

           Output will be indented and marked with a # so as not to interfere
           with test output. A newline will be put on the end if there isn't
           one already.

           We encourage using this rather than calling print directly.

       skip($reason)
           Skips the current test, reporting the $reason.

FUNCTIONS
       The use of the following functions is deprecated and strongly
       discouraged.

       Instead, you should use the object oriented interface described in the
       "SYNOPSIS" and in Test::Compile::Internal.

       They are automatically exported to your namespace,  which is no longer
       considered best practise.  At some stage in the future, this will stop
       and you'll have to import them explicitly to keep using them.

       The object oriented methods also provide a more consistent interface.
       For example: all_pm_files_ok() calls the plan() function - so you can't
       call multiple test functions in the same test file.

       all_pm_files_ok(@files)
           This function is deprecated.  Please use "all_pm_files_ok(@dirs)"
           in Test::Compile::Internal instead.  It's pretty much the same,
           except it doesn't call the plan() function.

           Checks all the perl module files it can find for compilation
           errors.

           It uses all_pm_files(@files) to find the perl module files.

           It also calls the plan() function for you (one test for each
           module), so you can't have already called plan(). Unfortunately,
           this also means you can't use this function with all_pl_files_ok().
           If this is a problem you should really be using the object oriented
           interface.

           Returns true if all Perl module files are ok, or false if any fail.

       all_pl_files_ok(@files)
           This function is deprecated.  Please use "all_pl_files_ok(@dirs)"
           in Test::Compile::Internal instead.  It's pretty much the same,
           except it doesn't call the plan() function.

           Checks all the perl script files it can find for compilation
           errors.

           It uses all_pl_files(@files) to find the perl script files.

           It also calls the plan() function for you (one test for each
           script), so you can't have already called "plan". Unfortunately,
           this also means you can't use this function with all_pm_files_ok().
           If this is a problem you should really be using the object oriented
           interface.

           Returns true if all Perl script files are ok, or false if any fail.

       "pm_file_ok($filename, $testname)"
           This function is deprecated.  Please use "all_pm_files_ok(@dirs)"
           in Test::Compile::Internal instead.  It's pretty much the same,
           except it won't allow you to specify a test name, and it can handle
           more than one file at a time.

           pm_file_ok() will okay the test if $filename compiles as a perl
           module.

           The optional second argument $testname is the name of the test. If
           it is omitted, pm_file_ok() chooses a default test name Compile
           test for $filename.

       "pl_file_ok($filename, $testname)"
           This function is deprecated.  Please use "all_pl_files_ok(@dirs)"
           in Test::Compile::Internal instead.  It's pretty much the same,
           except you can't specify a test name, and it can handle more than
           one file at a time.

           pl_file_ok() will okay the test if $filename compiles as a perl
           script. You need to give the path to the script relative to this
           distribution's base directory. So if you put your scripts in a
           'top-level' directory called script the argument would be
           "script/filename".

           The optional second argument $testname is the name of the test. If
           it is omitted, pl_file_ok() chooses a default test name Compile
           test for $filename.

       all_pm_files(@dirs)
           This function is deprecated.  Please use "all_pm_files(@dirs)" in
           Test::Compile::Internal instead.

           Returns a list of all the perl module files - that is, files ending
           in .pm - in @dirs and in directories below. If no directories are
           passed, it defaults to blib if blib exists, or else lib if not.
           Skips any files in CVS, .svn, or .git directories.

       all_pl_files(@dirs)
           This function is deprecated.  Please use "all_pl_files(@dirs)" in
           Test::Compile::Internal instead.

           Returns a list of all the perl script files - that is, any files in
           @dirs that either have a .pl extension, or have no extension and
           have a perl shebang line.

           If @dirs is undefined, it searches script if script exists, or else
           bin if bin exists.

           Skips any files in CVS, .svn, or .git directories.

       all_files_ok(@dirs)
           This function is deprecated.  Please use "all_files_ok(@dirs)" in
           Test::Compile::Internal instead.

           Checks all the perl files it can find for compilation errors.

           If @dirs is defined then it is taken as an array of directories to
           be searched for perl files, otherwise it searches some default
           locations - see "all_pm_files(@dirs)" and "all_pl_files(@dirs)".

SEE ALSO
       Test::Compile::Internal provides the object oriented interface to (and
       the inner workings for) the Test::Compile functionality.

       Test::Strict provides functions to ensure your perl files compile, with
       the added bonus that it will check you have used strict in all your
       files.

       Test::LoadAllModules just handles modules, not script files, but has
       more fine-grained control.
