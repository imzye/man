Media::Type::Simple(3)                     User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Media::Type::Simple - MIME Types and their file extensions

SYNOPSIS
         use Media::Type::Simple;

         $type = type_from_ext("jpg");        # returns "image/jpeg"

         $ext  = ext_from_type("text/plain"); # returns "txt"

DESCRIPTION
       This package gives a simple functions for obtaining common file
       extensions from media types, and from obtaining media types from file
       extensions.

       It is also relaxed with respect to having multiple media types
       associated with a file extension, or multiple extensions associated
       with a media type, and it includes media types for encodings such as
       "gzip".  It is defined this way in the default data, but this does not
       meet your needs, then you can have it use a system file (e.g.
       /etc/mime.types) or custom data.

       By default, there is a functional interface, although you can also use
       an object-oriented interface.  (Different objects will not share the
       same data.)

   Methods
       new
             $o = Media::Type::Simple->new;

           Creates a new object. You may optionally give it a filehandle of a
           file with system Media information, e.g.

             open $f, "/etc/mime.types";
             $o =  Media::Type::Simple->new( $f );

       add_types_from_file
             $o->add_types_from_file( $filehandle );

           Imports types from a file. Called by "new" when a filehandle is
           specified.

       is_type
             if (is_type("text/plain")) { ... }

             if ($o->is_type("text/plain")) { ... }

           Returns a true value if the type is defined in the system.

           Note that a true value does not necessarily indicate that the type
           has file extensions associated with it.

       alt_types
             @alts = alt_types("image/jpeg");

             @alts = $o->alt_types("image/jpeg");

           Returns alternative or related Media types that are defined in the
           system For instance,

             alt_types("model/dwg")

           returns the list

             image/vnd.dwg

       ext_from_type
             $ext  = ext_from_type( $type );

             @exts = ext_from_type( $type );

             $ext  = $o->ext_from_type( $type );

             @exts = $o->ext_from_type( $type );

           Returns the file extension(s) associated with the given Media type.
           When called in a scalar context, returns the first extension from
           the list.

           The order of extensions is based on the order that they occur in
           the source data (either the default here, or the order added using
           "add_types_from_file" or calls to "add_type").

       ext3_from_type
           Like "ext_from_type", but only returns file extensions under three
           characters long.

       is_ext
             if (is_ext("jpeg")) { ... }

             if ($o->is_ext("jpeg")) { ... }

           Returns a true value if the extension is defined in the system.

       type_from_ext
             $type  = type_from_ext( $extension );

             @types = type_from_ext( $extension );

             $type  = $o->type_from_ext( $extension );

             @types = $o->type_from_ext( $extension );

           Returns the Media type(s) associated with the extension.  When
           called in a scalar context, returns the first type from the list.

           The order of types is based on the order that they occur in the
           source data (either the default here, or the order added using
           "add_types_from_file" or calls to "add_type").

       add_type
             $o->add_type( $type, @extensions );

           Add a type to the system, with an optional list of extensions.

       clone
             $c = $o->clone;

           Returns a clone of a Media::Type::Simple object. This allows you to
           add new types via "add_types_from_file" or "add_type" without
           affecting the original.

           This can only be used in the object-oriented interface.

REVISION HISTORY
       For a detailed history see the Changes file included in this
       distribution.

SEE ALSO
       The MIME::Types module has a similar functionality, but with a more
       complex interface.

       LWP::MediaTypes will guess the media type from a file extension,
       attempting to use the ~/.media.types file.

       An "official" list of Media Types can be found at

       for the media types is based on the Debian "mime-support" package,

       from the original.
