TPMLIB_CancelCommand(3)                                TPMLIB_CancelCommand(3)


NAME
       TPMLIB_CancelCommand  - Cancel a TPM command

LIBRARY
       TPM library (libtpms, -ltpms)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <libtpms/tpm_library.h>

       uint32_t TPMLIB_CancelCommand(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The TPMLIB_CancelCommand() function indicates that the ongoing
       processing of a TPM command is to be cancelled. The cancellation will
       only be effective for certain time consuming operations, such as the
       creation of keys.

       Note that an implementation that wants to support cancellation of
       commands needs to process TPM commands in one thread and cancel them in
       another.
