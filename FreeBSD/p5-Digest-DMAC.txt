DMAC(3)               User Contributed Perl Documentation              DMAC(3)


NAME
       Digest::DMAC

REVISION
       Please use Digest::EMAC instead. EMAC is now the official name of
       Double CBC MAC.

EXAMPLE 1
           use Digest::DMAC qw(dmac hexdigest base64digest);

           print "Enter key: ";
           my $key = <STDIN>;
           chomp $key;

           print "Enter cipher: ";
           my $cipher = <STDIN>;
           chomp $cipher;

           print "Enter string: ";
           my $str = <STDIN>;
           chomp $str;

           my $mac = dmac($key, $cipher, $str);
           print hexdigest($mac), "\n";
           print base64digest($mac), "\n";

EXAMPLE 2
           use Digest::DMAC qw(dmac hexdigest base64digest);

           print "Enter key: ";
           my $key = <STDIN>;
           chomp $key;

           print "Enter cipher: ";
           my $cipher = <STDIN>;
           chomp $cipher;

           print "Enter file: ";
           my $infile = <STDIN>;
           chomp $infile;
           local $/ = undef;
           open F, $infile;
           my $data = <F>;

           my $mac = dmac($key, $cipher, $data);
           close F;
           print hexdigest($mac), "\n";
           print base64digest($mac), "\n";

EXAMPLE 3
           use Digest::DMAC qw(dmac hexdigest base64digest);

           print "Enter key: ";
           my $key = <STDIN>;
           chomp $key;

           print "Enter cipher: ";
           my $cipher = <STDIN>;
           chomp $cipher;
           local $/ = undef;

           while (<>) {
               my $mac = dmac($key, $cipher, $_);
               print hexdigest($mac), "\n";
           }

DESCRIPTION
       This is Encrypted MAC (EMAC), also known as Double MAC (DMAC). Unlike
       HMAC, which reuses an existing one-way hash function, such as MD5,
       SHA-1 or RIPEMD-160, EMAC reuses an existing block cipher to produce a
       secure message authentication code (MAC).

       Using the block cipher, a message is encrypted in CBC mode. The last
       block is taken as the MAC of the message. For fixed-length messages,
       this method is provably secure. In reality, however, messages have
       arbitrary lengths, and this method is not secure. To make secure MACs
       for variable length messages, the last block is encrypted once again
       with a different key. The security of this construction has been proved
       in the paper, ``CBC MAC for Real-Time Data Sources'' by Erez Petrank
       and Charles Rackoff. The security can be proved on the assumption that
       the underlying block cipher is pseudo-random.

       The performance and key-agility of EMAC are reasonable. EMAC is
       preferable for short messages because the block length is smaller
       compared to the schemes based on a hash function. EMAC is also chosen
       as one of the NESSIE winners for Message Authentication Codes, along
       with UMAC, TTMAC and HMAC. The current NESSIE specification chooses the
       AES as block cipher.

       Also specified in the paper by Petrank and Rackoff is the construction
       of two encryption keys from a single key. The first subkey is derived
       by encrypting `0' (zero) using the original secret key. To produce the
       second subkey, a `1' (one) is encrypted using the original secret key.
       The first subkey is used in CBC mode to encrypt the entire message. The
       last ciphertext block is then re-encrypted with the second subkey. The
       result is a MAC whose length is equal to the block length of the cipher
       used.

PREREQUISITES
       The module Crypt::CBC is required, plus any block cipher that is
       capable of returning its block size when queried. RC5 is not supported,
       however, because its block size is variable.

       MIME::Base64 is also required for base64 encoding of output.
