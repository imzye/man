NAME
       dnscheck-zonediff - Tool to periodically detect changes in a zone

SYNOPSIS
       dnscheck-zonediff [--debug]

       Options:

        --debug               Make the script print out some progress and result information.

EXPLANATION
       This script calls out to dig to download a zonefile using a
       cryptographic signature. The zone, the signature, the servers to ask,
       the file to save the data in, the database to put insert differences
       into and so on is all specified in config.yaml (or the corresponding
       site_config).

       This script relies heavily on the output from dig nor changing its
       format and to be in properly sorted order.
