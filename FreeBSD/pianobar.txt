DESCRIPTION
       pianobar is a lightweight console music player for the personalized
       online radio pandora.com.

              documentation at http://xiph.org/ao/doc/config.html


CONFIGURATION
       The configuration file consists of simple key = value lines, each
       terminated with a newline (\n) character. Keys are case sensitive.

       act_* keys control pianobar's key-bindings. Every one-byte character
       except for \x00 and the special value disabled are allowed here.


       act_help = ?
              Show keybindings.

       act_stationaddmusic = a
              Add more music to current station. You will be asked for a

              Non-american users need a proxy to use pandora.com. Only the
              xmlrpc interface will use this proxy. The music is streamed
              directly.

       gain_mul = 1.0
              Pandora sends a ReplayGain value with every song. This sets a
              multiplier so that the gain adjustment can be reduced. 0.0 means
              no gain adjustment, 1.0 means full gain adjustment, values
              inbetween reduce the magnitude of gain adjustment.


       history = 5

              specifying a password with password.


       proxy = http://user:password@host:port/
              Use a http proxy. Note that this setting overrides the
              http_proxy environment variable. Only "Basic" http
              authentication is supported.


       rpc_host = tuner.pandora.com


       rpc_tls_port = 443


       sample_rate = 0

       volume = 0
              Initial volume correction in dB. Usually between -30 and +5.


REMOTE CONTROL
       pianobar can be controlled through a fifo. You have to create it
       yourself by executing

        mkfifo ~/.config/pianobar/ctl

       Adjust the path if you set up a $XDG_CONFIG_HOME or changed the fifo
       setting.  Afterwards you can write commands directly into the fifo.
       Example (next song):

        echo -n 'n' > ~/.config/pianobar/ctl

       n is the keybinding for "next song". If you customized your keybindings
       you have to use these characters to control pianobar.  This behaviour
       may change in the future!

       Another example:

        while true; do;
           nc -l -p 12345 -s localhost localhost > ~/.config/pianobar/ctl;
           sleep 1;
        done

        echo -ne 'n\x1a' | nc -q 0 127.0.0.1 12345


EVENTCMD
       pianobar can report certain "events" to an external application (see
       CONFIGURATION ). This application is started with the event name as
       it's first argument. More information like error code and description,
       was well as song information related to the current event, is supplied
       through stdin.

       Currently supported events are: artistbookmark, songban, songbookmark,
       songexplain, songfinish, songlove, songmove, songshelf, songstart,
       stationaddgenre, stationaddmusic, stationaddshared, stationcreate,
       stationdelete, stationdeleteartistseed, stationdeletefeedback,
       stationdeletesongseed, stationfetchinfo, stationfetchplaylist,
       stationfetchgenre stationquickmixtoggle, stationrename, userlogin,
       usergetstations

       An example script can be found in the contrib/ directory of pianobar's
       source distribution.
