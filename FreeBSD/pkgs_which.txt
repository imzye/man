SYNOPSIS
       pkgs_which [-oqvsd] {dir|file} [...]

       pkgs_which {-h|-?|--help}

       pkgs_which --man

OPTIONS
           --origins, -o      print package origins instead of names
           --quiet, -q        only print actual package names
           --verbose, -v      also print unmatched files
           --sort, -s         sort package and file lists
           --[no-]cacheall    read and cache all package file lists first
           --[no-]find        descend directories on the command line [default]

           --debug, -d        emit additional debug information on stderr

           --help, -h, -?     print a brief help message and quit
           --man              show the full full documentation and quit

       Long options can be abbreviated to the shortest unambiguous string.
       Short options can be bundled (Example: pkgs_which -qo ...).

DESCRIPTION
       pkgs_which is a tool to efficiently look up which FreeBSD ports or
       packages installed the files on its command line, or the files in the
       directories on the command line.

       pkgs_which

       •   accepts files on the command line, which are looked up directly,

       •   accepts directories on the command line, which are recursively
           scanned for regular files, which are then looked up,

       •   accepts an arbitrary mix of files and directories on the command
           line,

       •   prints each port or package only once,

       •   prints port/package names by default, but can print origins instead
           (--origins option).

       •   supports a "quiet" mode that emits output suitable for scripting
           and shell command expansion (see EXAMPLES below)

       •   is optimized for efficient bulk lookups of data without assistance
           of an on-disk database.

       It is most useful for quickly obtaining a list of site-packages that
       need to be reinstalled after upgrading a script language interpreter to
       a new version that uses new directories for its site-packages, for
       instance, after a Python 2.6 => 2.7 or Perl 5.10 => 5.12 upgrade, and
       is a good companion to portmaster(8).

   IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
       pkgs_which uses pkg_info -L to accelerate the process. It first obtains
       a list of all files, looks at a random one, looks up the corresponding
       package and records its name, and then purges all files belonging to it
       before looking up the next file.

       pkgs_which does not spawn subshells for pkg_info for security reasons,
       and makes sure to launder the pkg_info output.

       The --cacheall option (default on) makes pkgs_which read all package
       file lists upon start. This takes a few seconds on a GHz-class computer
       but voids the need to run pkg_info -W often later on.

       For looking up very few files, it is more efficient to use
       --no-cacheall.

   RELATED TOOLS
       pkgs_which performs a similar task to pkg_which(1) that is part of the
       ports-mgmt/portupgrade port, but unlike the latter, it does not require
       a database, and is optimized for bulk lookups of entire directory
       trees.

       portmaster(8) is a tool written by Doug Barton to upgrade installed
       ports and their dependencies that does not require port/package
       databases.

EXAMPLES
       Obtain the sorted list of all packages that installed at least one file
       under /usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages:

         pkgs_which --sort /usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages

       Upgrade all packages that installed at least one file under
       /usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages (this assumes a Bourne-shell
       such as sh, ash, ksh, bash):

         portmaster -d $(pkgs_which -qo /usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages)

HISTORY
       0.4.1 2014-02-11
         - do not require files given on command line are regular files,
           but accept any non-directory (for instance, symlinks).

           Workaround for previous versions: use --no-find if you intend to
           look up non-regular files.

       0.4.0 2013-11-28
         - support pkgNG. Known issue is that pkg which returns bogus exit
           codes, spamming your screen.  pkgs_which works nonetheless.
           https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/issues/657

           Note that pkgNG always uses --nocache implictly for speed:
           https://github.com/freebsd/pkg/issues/658

           Known issue: the pkgNG detection is a hack. It just looks for the
           executable and the database in default locations, but does not
           attempt to run "pkg -N".

       0.3.0 2013-03-11
         - read pkg_info -L information in chunks of 100 packages at a time,
           to avoid forking once per package, which was slow.

       0.2.0 2011-07-25
         - fixed a bug where skipping non-existent command line arguments
           failed and resulted in an unterminated (endless) loop.

         - added the --no-find option

       0.1.0 2011-03-12
         - pkgs_which made its first appearance in the FreeBSD ports tree
