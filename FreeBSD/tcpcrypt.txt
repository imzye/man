tcnetstat(8)                                                      tcnetstat(8)

NAME
       tcnetstat - Print information about network connections protected by
       tcpcrypt

SYNOPSIS
       tcnetstat

DESCRIPTION
       The tcnetstat utility prints the session id of each TCP connection that
       is currently being protected by the tcpcrypt protocol.

OPTIONS
       Where the tcpcrypt protocol is implemented by the tcpcryptd daemon,
       this utility communicates with the daemon via a "control socket",
       configurable with -u socket_address.  If socket_address begins with
       "/", it is interpreted as a filesystem path pointing to a unix-domain
       socket; if it is of the form ":port", it is interpreted as the internet
       address localhost:port.
