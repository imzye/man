POD2SDF(1)            User Contributed Perl Documentation           POD2SDF(1)


NAME
       pod2sdf - converts POD to SDF markup

SYNOPSIS
         pod2sdf [-m] infile > outfile

DESCRIPTION
       pod2sdf should be used when one wants to use SDF instead of POD as the
       base documentation format.  sdf does this convertion on the fly for
       "*.pod, *.pl, *.pm" files for you.  So pod2sdf is only needed when one
       wants to make extensive use of the powerful features of SDF and marking
       them with "=begin sdf" and "=end sdf" gets inconvenient.
