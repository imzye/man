NAME
       HTML::Display - display HTML locally in a browser

SYNOPSIS
         use strict;
         use HTML::Display;

         # guess the best value from $ENV{PERL_HTML_DISPLAY_CLASS}
         # or $ENV{PERL_HTML_DISPLAY_COMMAND}
         # or the operating system, in that order
         my $browser = HTML::Display->new();
         warn "# Displaying HTML using " . ref $browser;
         my $location = "http://www.google.com/";
         $browser->display(html => $html, location => $location);

         # Or, for a one-off job :
         display("<html><body><h1>Hello world!</h1></body></html>");

DESCRIPTION
       This module abstracts the task of displaying HTML to the user. The
       displaying is done by launching a browser and navigating it to either a
       temporary file with the HTML stored in it, or, if possible, by pushing
       the HTML directly into the browser window.

       The module tries to automagically select the "correct" browser, but if
       it dosen't find a good browser, you can modify the behaviour by setting
       some environment variables :

         PERL_HTML_DISPLAY_CLASS

       If HTML::Display already provides a class for the browser you want to
       use, setting "PERL_HTML_DISPLAY_CLASS" to the name of the class will
       make HTML::Display use that class instead of what it detects.

         PERL_HTML_DISPLAY_COMMAND

       If there is no specialized class yet, but your browser can be
       controlled via the command line, then setting
       "PERL_HTML_DISPLAY_COMMAND" to the string to navigate to the URL will
       make HTML::Display use a system() call to the string. A %s in the value
       will be replaced with the name of the temporary file containing the
       HTML to display.

   %HTML::Display::os_default
       The hash %HTML::Display::os_default contains pairs of class names for
       the different operating systems and routines that test whether this
       script is currently running under it. If you you want to dynamically
       add a new class or replace a class (or the rule), modify %os_default :

         # Install class for MagicOS
         $HTML::Display::os_default{"HTML::Display::MagicOS"}
           = sub { $^O =~ qr/magic/i };

   __PACKAGE__->new %ARGS
   $browser->display( %ARGS )
       Will display the HTML. The following arguments are valid :

         base     => Base to which all relative links will be resolved
         html     => Scalar containing the HTML to be displayed
         file     => Scalar containing the name of the file to be displayed
                                                       This file will possibly be copied into a temporary file!

         location    (synonymous to base)

       If only one argument is passed, then it is taken as if

         html => $_[0]

       was passed.

EXPORTS
       The subroutine "display" is exported by default

COMMAND LINE USAGE
       Display some HTML to the user :

         perl -MHTML::Display -e "display '<html><body><h1>Hello world</body></html>'"

       Display a web page to the user :

         perl -MLWP::Simple -MHTML::Display -e "display get 'http://www.google.com'"

       Display the same page with the images also working :

         perl -MLWP::Simple -MHTML::Display -e "display html => get('http://www.google.com'),
                                                        location => 'http://www.google.com'"
