NAME
       tnylpo-convert - converts text files to and from the CP/M format

SYNOPSIS
       tnylpo-convert [-aeiz] [-f <config-file>] [ (-u (<fn> | -) | -c <fn>) [
              (-u (<fn> | -) | -c <fn>) ] ]

       tnylpo-convert -h

DESCRIPTION
       tnylpo-convert is a companion program of tnylpo(1) and allows the
       conversion of text files from the format used by the host operating
       system to the format used by CP/M applications running under tnylpo(1)
       (resp.  vice versa).

       The difference between the Unix text file format and CP/M text files is
       threefold:

       —      Unix uses a single <lf> (0x0a) character as line end marker,
              while CP/M uses the sequence <cr> <lf> (0x0d 0x0a).

       —      CP/M uses the first <sub> (0x1a) character in the file as end of
              file marker, except if the logical end of the text file
              coincides with a 128 byte record boundary

       —      CP/M uses 8-bit (or 7-bit) characters, while most recent
              operating systems use wide or multibyte character sets.

       tnylpo-convert shares its configuration files with tnylpo(1), but uses
       only the options for the character set definitions ([alt] char, [alt]
       charset, and unprintable), on which it bases its character translation.
       Both the configuration file syntax and the way tnylpo-convert finds its
       configuration are described in the man page of tnylpo(1).

OPTIONS
       -a     use the alternate character set from the configuration file for
              character translation

       -c <cpm-textfile>
              use the text file <cpm-textfile> in CP/M format as source or
              target of the conversion

       -e     treat unconvertible characters in the source file as an error

       -f <config-file>
              tell tnylpo-convert explicitly which configuration file to use

       -h     ask tnylpo-convert to show a short command line synopsis (-h
              cannot be used in combination with any other command line
              option)

       -i     ignore all unconvertible characters by silently dropping them

       -u <textfile>
              use the text file <textfile> in host system format as source or
              target of the conversion; if - is given instead of <textfile>,
              stdin is read resp.  stdout is written

       -z     always append a <sub> (0x1a) character as an end of file marker
              to CP/M text files, even if they end on a record boundary

       The options -e and -i are mutually exclusive; if neither is given,
       tnylpo-convert will drop unconvertible characters, but issue a warning.

       tnylpo-convert takes no positional arguments. The -c and -u options may
       be given at most twice; the first occurrence defines the source file,
       the second occurrence the target file of the conversion.  If the target
       file or both source and target files are missing, -u - is used instead.
       The same file name may be given both as source and as target, since
       tnylpo-convert uses a temporary file for output, which is renamed to
       the target file name on successful completion (this is not done if
       stdout is used for output).

EXIT STATUS
       tnylpo-convert exits with status 0 if it didn't encounter command line,
       configuration, or I/O errors; otherwise (or if unconvertible characters
       are encountered and the -e option is specified on the command line),
       status 1 is returned.

FILES
   ./.tnylpo.conf
   ~/.tnylpo.conf
       default configuration files, see tnylpo(1)

EXAMPLES
       tnylpo-convert -f myconf.conf -e -c hugo.txt -u -

       converts the contents of the CP/M text file hugo.txt to the format and
       character set of the host operating system and prints them on stdout.
       Character set information is taken from the configuration file
       myconf.conf, and any unconvertible characters in hugo.txt will cause
       the conversion to fail.

       tnylpo-convert -u test.pas -c test.pas -z

       converts the Unix text file test.pas to CP/M format; the default
       configuration file (if found) is used for character set information.
       The resulting file is always terminated with at least one <sub> (0x1a)
       character.
