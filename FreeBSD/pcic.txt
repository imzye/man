NAME
     pcic – PC Card bridge driver

SYNOPSIS
     device pcic
     device pccard

DESCRIPTION
     The pcic driver provides support for older ISA and non-Yenta PCI PC Card
     bridges.  The pcic driver supports most ExCA devices attached to the ISA
     bus or PCI devices that do not conform to the Yenta specification.

     The following ISA devices, or true clones, are supported in the current
     code.

     Intel i82365SL Step A
     Intel i82365SL Step B
     Intel i82365SL Step C  Intel's original 16-bit PC Card controller.
     Intel i82365SL-DF      Intel's last version of this device.  3.3V support
                            was added.
     VLSI 82C146            An older VLSI part with some issues on some
                            machines.
     Cirrus Logic PD-6710
     Cirrus Logic PD-6720
     Cirrus Logic PD-6722   Cirrus Logic's pcic controller.  Compatible with
                            the i82365SL Step C with the addition of a
                            different 3.3V control.
     Ricoh RF5C296
     Ricoh RF5C396          Ricoh's PC Card bridge chips.  These are
                            compatible with the i82365SL Step C, but with yet
                            another different 3.3V control.
     Vadem 365
     Vadem 465              Compatible with i82365SL Step C.
     Vadem 468
     Vadem 469              Like the earlier Vadem models, but with Vadem's
                            own, incompatible, 3.3V control system.
     IBM PCIC               IBM clone of the original i82365SL part, with its
                            own ID register value.  Has no 3.3V ability.

     Many other vendors made parts in this arena, but most of them were
     compatible with one of the above chipsets.

     The following PCI pcmcia bridges are supported:

     Cirrus Logic PD6729
     Cirrus Logic PD6730

     O2micro OZ6729
     O2micro OZ6730

BUGS
     This does not work at all at the moment.
