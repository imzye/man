NAME
       blogbench - a realistic filesystem benchmark

SYNTAX
       blogbench -d <directory>

DESCRIPTION
       Blogbench is a portable filesystem benchmark that tries to reproduce
       the load of a real-world busy file server.
       It stresses the filesystem with multiple threads performing random
       reads, writes and rewrites in order to get a realistic idea of the
       scalability and the concurrency a system can handle.

OPTIONS
       --help Display a complete list of available switches.

EXAMPLES
       The minimal way to run the test is to just give the path to an empty
       and writable directory:

       blogbench -d /path/to/the/directory

       Blogbench will start the required threads and the test will run during
       5 minutes. A final "score" will then be given as an indication of read
       and write performance.
