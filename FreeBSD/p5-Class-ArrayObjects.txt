NAME
       Class::ArrayObjects - utility class for array based objects

SYNOPSIS
         package Some::Class;
         use Class::ArrayObjects define => {
                                             fields  => [qw(_foo_ _bar_ BAZ)],
                                           };

         or

         package Other::Class;
         use base 'Some::Class';
         use Class::ArrayObjects extend => {
                                             class   => 'Some::Class',
                                             with    => [qw(_zorg_ _fnord_ BEZ)],
                                             import  => 1,
                                           };

DESCRIPTION
       This module is little more than a cute way of defining constant subs in
       your own package. Constant subs are very useful when dealing with array
       based objects because they allow one to access array slots by name
       instead of by index.

   Why use arrays for objects instead of hashes ?
       There are two apparently compelling reasons to use arrays for objects
       instead of hashes.

       First: speed. In my benchmarks on a few boxes around here I've seen
       arrays be faster by 30%. I must admit that my benchmarks weren't
       perfect as I wasn't all that interested in speed per se, only in
       knowing whether I was to take a serious performance hit or not (I was
       nevertheless pleasantly surprised to note the opposite, it can't hurt).

       Second: memory. Memory was much more important to me as I was targeting
       a mod_perl environment where every bit of memory tends to count.
       Depending on how they are used, arrays use from 30% up to 65% less
       space than hashes. As a rule of thumb the more keys you have, the more
       you may save.

       It must be said though that despite the fact that I happened to be
       looking for ways to save space, it's not a reason to jump into array
       based objects and start converting every single hash you have to an
       array. Yes, I did see some of my processes lose ~3Mo of unshared memory
       so there are definitely cases when it's useful. Such cases are usually
       when you have lots of objects and/or structures that are fairly similar
       in nature (ie have the same keys) but contain different values. I don't
       know how Perl works internally but it would seem only logical that it
       has to store the keys with every hash, whereas using arrays there are
       no keys (which is why this package exists: to provide you with
       something that looks like keys into arrays).

       In addition to that, this package can be seen as twisting slightly the
       view on how to do OO in Perl, encouraging some limited encapsulation of
       fields and extension subclassing rather than override subclassing (the
       latter really being a matter of taste).

   Why not pseudo-hashes ?
       Pseudo-hashes never appealed to me, they always seemed to have been
       hacked on top of Perl. They never left experimental status, which
       probably says a lot already. A number of things that work with hashes
       and arrays don't work with them (and development seems to have
       stopped). And overall, they usually end up not saving you any space
       anyway. Pseudo-hashes must die.

   Why Class::ArrayObjects ?
       But why then use this class instead of the "enum" or "constant" modules
       ? Because it adds extra sugar (yum).

       Its main advantage over "constant" (imho of course) is that you don't
       have to define the value of each field. Less typing, more readability.

       "enum" also provides that plus but it enforces naming rules in a way
       which I find limiting (it probably has very good reasons to do so, but
       I think that they don't apply in the context of array based objects).
       This module only complains if you try to use a field name that isn't a
       valid Perl sub name. (Note: right now it doesn't even complain because
       I was convinced when I wrote it that Perl would. But it turns out that
       you are perfectly allowed to define a sub with a forbidden name.
       Whether this is a bug or a feature, I don't know).

       And last but not least, it defines a way to allow for inheritance while
       using array based objects. A major drawback of array based objects is
       that unlike with hashes, if your base class adds a field, you have to
       move all your fields' indices up by one. You shouldn't have to know
       such things, or even to care about it.

       Here, instead of using the "define" option (which creates fields in a
       class), simply use the "extend" option. Tell it which class to extend
       (it needs to be already loaded, and must use Class::ArrayObjects to
       define its fields too) and which fields to add.  Class::ArrayObjects
       takes care of counting from the right index in your subclass. It can't
       do multiple inheritance, and unless someone hacks it in somehow I doubt
       it ever will.

       You may use the "import" option to require that your parents' fields be
       defined in your own package too, so that you can access them. It is off
       by default so that you can use fields with the same names as those of
       your superclasse(s) (which is a plus over hash based objects) and also
       to avoid defining subs all over your package without you knowing about
       them.

       It may be worth noting that the added functionality doesn't get in the
       way, and using this to define constants is just as fast as using
       "constant" or "enum".

USING Class::ArrayObjects
       There are two ways to use Class::ArrayObjects, either to simply define
       fields to use in your own objects, or to extend fields defined in a
       superclass of your. In a wild burst of creative naming I thus spawned
       into existence two options named respectively "define" and "extend".

       The way the two are used is the same:

       use Class::ArrayObjects option-name => hashref of options

   The define option
         package Some::Class;
         use Class::ArrayObjects define => {
                                             fields  => [qw(_foo_ _bar_ BAZ)],
                                           };

       "define" has only one option: "fields". It is an arrayref of strings
       which are the names of the fields you wish to use. They can be
       anything, so long as they are valid Perl sub names.

   The extend option
         package Other::Class;
         use base 'Some::Class';
         use Class::ArrayObjects extend => {
                                             class   => 'Some::Class',
                                             with    => [qw(_zorg_ _fnord_ BEZ)],
                                             import  => 1,
                                           };

       "extend" has three options:

       •   class

           This defines the class to extend (it must also use
           Class::ArrayObjects and have been loaded previously). If that class
           is not specified, it will look at @ISA. If @ISA contains only one
           item it will use that one.

       •   with

           This is exactly equivalent to "fields" except that it reads better
           to have extend class Foo with x,y,z.

       •   import

           Defaulting to false, setting it to any true value will make your
           superclasses' fields also defined in your package. This can be
           needed at times, though I wouldn't encourage its use.

   After that ?
       After you've defined fields, all you have to do is use them as indices
       to your arrays.

         package Some::Class;
         use Class::ArrayObjects define => {
                                             fields  => [qw(_foo_ _bar_ BAZ)],
                                           };

         my @arry = qw(zorg stuff blurp);
         print $arry[_bar_]; # stuff

       Any operation you can do on arrays with numeric indices works exactly
       the same way. The only difference is that you are using names, which
       are much easier to remember. There is no performance penalty for this,
       Perl is smart enough to inline the return values of constant subs so
       that when in the above example you say _bar_ it really sees 1.

   A note to mod_perl users
       The contexts in which I use this module are mostly mod_perl related.
       In fact, one of the reasons I created it was to allow for the space
       efficient representation of many objects. It may be further
       optimizable, but so far it has already seemed to work well.

       You can preload this module without defining any fields as follows:

         use Class::ArrayObjects qw();

       In that case, import() will not be called and nothing will happen other
       then the preloading of the code. As a precaution, even if it were
       called it would return immediately.

       I do recommend that you preload all modules that are based on
       Class::ArrayObjects so that the data it stores internally about which
       fields belong to which classes (in order to allow for extension)
       remains shared by all the processes.

BUGS AND CAVEATS
       I don't know of any outstanding bugs presently but it is not impossible
       that some may have filtered out. I have been using this module in
       production for some time now, and it appears to be behaving with
       stability.

       Of course, you mustn't define a field in your package with the same
       name as another sub.

       As a rule of thumb, I find that this kind of class works better for
       extension subclasses than for override subclasses, but YMMV.

TODO
        - add an interface to allow people to mess with the internals on
        demand
        - add serialisation helpers to allow one to persist an object based
        on Class::ArrayObjects and later retrieve it regardless of whether
        the order of the fields have changed or not.
