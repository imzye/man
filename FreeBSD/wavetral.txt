DESCRIPTION
       Wavetral is a small program to convert single cycle waveforms to audio
       spectra and vice versa. It supports multiple input and output formats
       to allow you to use your favourite waveforms in different synthesizers.

       Currently there is specific support for Csound, Yoshimi and the Waldorf
       Microwave II/XT, as well as any other synthesizer that can import
       waveforms as audio or plaintext.

OPTIONS
   INFORMATION OPTIONS
       -h --help
              Show a help message, listing all options

       -v --version
              Show the version of wavetral

       -l --list input_file
              List the items (waveforms or spectra) in the given input file
              (currently only supported with the mw2 Microwave II/XT format)

   CONVERSION OPTIONS
       -i --input input_file
              Name of the input file

       -f --input_format format
              Format of the input file (only necessary if the format is not
              autodetected).  Supported formats are: audio (.wav and .aiff),
              text (one value per line), ftable (Csound ftsave(k) format
              ftables) and mw2 (Waldorf Microwave II/XT wave dump)

       -t --input_type type
              Type of the input (wave or harm) for waveform or harmonic
              spectrum respectively. This is only required for text and Csound
              ftable files.

       -w --input_wave wave_number
              Number of the waveform to be converted (only supported for the
              Waldorf Microwave II/XT mw2 format)

       -o --output output_file
              File to write the converted wave/spectrum to.

       -F --output_format format
              Format of the output (only required if not autodetected).
              Currently supported formats are: audio (.wav and .aiff), text
              (one value per line), ysc (Yoshimi script) and mw2 (Waldorf
              Microwave II/XT wave dump). Yoshimi scripts can be run locally
              (using runlocal) in the wave context of the AddSynth voices or
              the PadSynth.

       -T --output_type type
              Type of the output (wave or harm) for waveform or harmonic
              spectrum respectively. This is only required for text files.

       -W --output_wave wave_number
              Wave number to be written (only supported for the Waldorf
              Microwave II/XT mw2 format)

       -s --output_size size
              The number of samples or harmonics to be written to the output
              file.

       -r --samplerate samplerate
              Samplerate of the output file (only supported for the audio
              format, the default is 44100).

       -z --threshold
              Threshold at which harmonics should be set to 0 (default 1 *
              10(-5) or 0.00001)
