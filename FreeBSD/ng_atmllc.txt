NG_ATMLLC(4)           FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual           NG_ATMLLC(4)

NAME
     ng_atmllc – ATM LLC netgraph node type

SYNOPSIS
     #include <netgraph/ng_atmllc.h>

DESCRIPTION
     The atmllc node type translates frames in to and out of ATM LLC
     encapsulation, as specified by RFC 1483.  In LLC encapsulation the
     protocol of a given protocol data unit (PDU) is specified by an IEEE
     802.2 LLC header, possibly followed by an IEEE 802.1a SubNetwork
     Attachment Point (SNAP) header.  This node currently handles the Ethernet
     and FDDI protocols.

     The node transmits and receives ATM PDUs on the atm hook.  Received PDUs
     are decoded and forwarded to the ether or fddi hooks as appropriate.
     Data received on the ether or fddi hooks are assumed to be full Ethernet
     or FDDI packets as appropriate and are encapsulated into a PDU and
     transmitted via the atm hook.

HOOKS
     This node type supports the following hooks:

     atm        ATM connection.  Typically, this hook would be connected to a
                ng_atm(4) node, which handles transmission of ATM PDUs over an
                ATM device.

     ether      Ethernet connection.  This hook sends and receives Ethernet
                frames.  This would normally be connected to an ng_eiface(4)
                node if in use.

     fddi       FDDI connection.  This hook sends and receives FDDI frames.

CONTROL MESSAGES
     This node type supports the generic control messages.

SHUTDOWN
     This node shuts down upon receipt of a NGM_SHUTDOWN control message, or
     when all hooks have been disconnected.
