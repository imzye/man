DateTime::Format::Roman(3)                 User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       DateTime::Format::Roman - Roman day numbering for DateTime objects

SYNOPSIS
         use DateTime::Format::Roman;

         my $formatter = DateTime::Format::Roman->new(
                             pattern => '%d %f %b %y' );

         my $dt = DateTime->new( year => 2003, month => 5, day => 28 );

         $formatter->format_datetime($dt);
          # '5 Kal Jun 2003'

DESCRIPTION
       This module formats dates in the Roman style.

       The Romans expressed their dates in relation to three fixed dates per
       month. For example: the Ides of March was the 15th of that month; 14
       March was called "2 Ides", 13 March was called "3 Ides", etcetera. The
       days in the second half of the month were named after the first day of
       the next month, the "Kalends"; e.g. 16 March was called "17 Kalends of
       April".

METHODS
       •   new( pattern => $string )

           Creates a new formatter object. The optional formatting pattern
           defines the format of the output of format_datetime(). If no
           formatting pattern is given, a reasonable default is used.

       •   format_datetime($datetime)

           Retruns the formatted string. This method can be called on a
           formatter object (created by new()), or it can be called as a class
           method. In the latter case, the default pattern is used.

   PATTERN SPECIFIERS
       The following specifiers are allowed in the format strings given to the
       new() method:

       •   %b

           The abbreviated month name.

       •   %B

           The full month name.

       •   %d

           The day of the month as a decimal number (including '1' for the
           fixed days).

       •   %D

           The day of the month, written as a number plus the corresponding
           fixed day.

       •   %f

           The 'fixed day' part of the date.

       •   %m

           The month as a decimal number (range 1 to 12).

       •   %y

           The year as a decimal number.

       If a specifier is preceded by 'O' or 'o', numbers will be written in
       uppercase and lowercase Roman numerals, respectively.

       The %f specifier accepts an additional argument of 1 digit, specifying
       the length of the output:

           %0f : abbreviated name (e.g. "Kal")
           %1f : full name (e.g. "Kalends")
           %2f : one-letter abbreviation (e.g. "K")

SUPPORT
       Support for  this module is  provided via the  datetime@perl.org email
       list. See <https://lists.perl.org/> for more details.

       Note that this is a beta release. The interface *will* change,
       especially the format specifiers, and the way the "fixed days" are
       returned.
