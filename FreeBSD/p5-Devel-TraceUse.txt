NAME
       Devel::TraceUse - show the modules your program loads, recursively

VERSION
       version 2.096

SYNOPSIS
       An apparently simple program may load a lot of modules.  That's useful,
       but sometimes you may wonder exactly which part of your program loads
       which module.

       "Devel::TraceUse" can analyze a program to see which part used which
       module.  I recommend using it from the command line:

         $ perl -d:TraceUse your_program.pl

       This will display a tree of the modules ultimately used to run your
       program.  (It also runs your program with only a little startup cost
       all the way through to the end.)

         Modules used from your_program.pl:
            1.  strict 1.04, your_program.pl line 1 [main]
            2.  warnings 1.06, your_program.pl line 2 [main]
            3.  Getopt::Long 2.37, your_program.pl line 3 [main]
            4.    vars 1.01, Getopt/Long.pm line 37
            5.      warnings::register 1.01, vars.pm line 7
            6.    Exporter 5.62, Getopt/Long.pm line 43
            9.      Exporter::Heavy 5.62, Exporter.pm line 18
            7.    constant 1.13, Getopt/Long.pm line 226
            8.    overload 1.06, Getopt/Long.pm line 1487 [Getopt::Long::CallBack]

       The load order is listed on the first column. The version is displayed
       after the module name, if available. The calling package is shown
       between square brackets if different from the package that can be
       inferred from the file name. Extra information is also provided if the
       module was loaded from within and "eval".

       "Devel::TraceUse" will also report modules that failed to be loaded,
       under the modules that tried to load them.

       In the very rare case when "Devel::TraceUse" is not able to attach a
       loaded module to the tree, it will be reported at the end.

       If a particular line of code is used at least 2 times to load modules,
       it is considered as part of a "module loading proxy subroutine", or
       just "proxy".  "base::import", "parent::import",
       "Module::Runtime::require_module" are such subroutines, among others.
       If proxies are found, the list is reported like this:

            <occurences> <filename> line <line>[, sub <subname>]

       Example:

           Possible proxies:
             59 Module/Runtime.pm, line 317, sub require_module
             13 base.pm line 90, sub import
              3 Module/Pluggable/Object.pm line 311, sub _require

       Even though using "-MDevel::TraceUse" is possible, it is preferable to
       use "-d:TraceUse", as the debugger will provide more accurate
       information.  You will be reminded in the output.

       If you want to know only the modules loaded during the compile phase,
       use the standard "-c" option of perl (see perlrun):

         $ perl -c -d:TraceUse your_program.pl

   Parameters
       You can hide the core modules that your program used by providing
       parameters at "use" time:

         $ perl -d:TraceUse[=<option1>:<value1>[,<option2>:<value2>[...]]]

       "hidecore"
             $ perl -d:TraceUse=hidecore your_program.pl

           This will not renumber the modules so the core module's positions
           will be visible as gaps in the numbering. In some cases evidence
           may also be visible of the core module's usage (e.g. a caller shown
           as base or parent).

           You may also specify the version of Perl for which you want to hide
           the core modules (the default is the running version):

             $ perl -d:TraceUse=hidecore:5.8.1 your_program.pl

           The version string can be given as x.yyy.zzz (dot-separated) or
           x.yyyzzz (decimal). For example, the strings 5.8.1, 5.08.01,
           5.008.001 and 5.008001 will all represent Perl version 5.8.1, and
           5.5.30, "5.005_03" will all represent Perl version 5.005_03.

       "output"
             $ perl -d:TraceUse=output:out.txt your_program.pl

           This will output the TraceUse result to the given file instead of
           warn.

           Note that TraceUse warnings will still be output as warnings.

           The output file is opened at initialization time, so there should
           be no surprise in relative path interpretation even if your program
           changes the current directory.

SEE ALSO
       There are plenty of modules on CPAN for getting a list of your code's
       dependencies. They fall into three general classes:

       1.  Those that tell you what modules were actually loaded at run-time,
           like "Devel-TraceUse", through introspection.

           This is often done by looking at %INC, but other approaches include
           over-riding the "require" built-in, or adding a coderef to the head
           of @INC (see perldoc require
           <http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/require.html> for more details
           of that approach).  This may not give you the full list of
           dependencies, because different modules may be loaded depended on
           the path taken through the code.

       2.  Those that parse the code, to determine dependencies.

           This may catch some dependencies missed by the previous category,
           but in turn may miss modules that are dynamically loaded, or where
           the code doesn't match the regexps / parsing techniques used to
           find "use", "require" and friends.

       3.  Those that look at the declared dependencies in distributions'
           metadata files ("META.yml" and "META.json").

   Introspectors
       App::FatPacker::Trace and Devel::Dependencies just gives a flat list of
       dependencies.  Devel::VersionDump is similar, but also displays the
       version of each module found.

       Instead of listing the names of modules loaded, Devel::Loaded lists the
       full paths to the modules. This might help you spot issues caused by
       the same module being in multiple directories on your @INC path, I
       guess.

       Devel::Modlist prints a table of the modules used, and the version of
       the module installed (not the version that was specified when "use"ing
       the module). It can also map modules to CPAN distributions, and list
       the distributions you're dependent on.

       Devel::TraceDeps overrides the "do" and "require" built-ins, so it can
       get finer-grained information about which modules were used by which
       module. It generates information about the dependencies, which you can
       then process with Devel::TraceDeps::Scan.

       Devel::TraceLoad also overrides "require", but it doesn't override
       "do", so it might miss some dependencies in older code.

       Module::PrintUsed looks at %INC to identify dependencies, and prints a
       table with module name, version, and the local path where it was loaded
       from.

   Parsers
       Module::Dependency::Grapher parses locally installed modules to
       determine the full dependency graph, which it can then dump as ASCII or
       one of several graph formats.

       Module::Extract::Use uses PPI to parse a source file and extract
       modules used. It only reports the first level of dependencies.

       Module::Used also uses PPI and provides a nice clean API, also only
       providing the first level of dependencies.

       Perl::PrereqScanner is yet another PPI-based scanner, but is probably
       the best of the lot. App::PrereqGrapher uses "Perl::PrereqScanner" to
       recursively identify dependencies, then generate a graph in a number of
       formats; the prereq-grapher <https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/App-
       PrereqGrapher/bin/prereq-grapher> provides a command-line interface to
       all of that.

       Module::ExtractUse (not to be confused with the previous module!)  uses
       Parse::RecDescent to parse perl files looking for "use" and "require"
       statements. It doesn't recurse, so you just get the first level of
       dependencies.

   Metadata spelunkers
       CPAN::FindDependencies fetches "META.yml" or "Makefile.PL" files from
       search.cpan.org <http://search.cpan.org>, so it takes a while to run.

       Dist::Requires looks at the tarball for a module (or the extracted
       directory structure) and determines the immediate dependencies. It
       doesn't find the next level of dependencies and beyond, which
       CPAN::FindDependencies does.

       Module::Depends::Tree uses CPANPLUS to grab tarballs for distributions
       then extracts dependency information from metadata files.  It includes
       a front-end script called "deptree".
