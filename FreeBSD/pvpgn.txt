BNBOT(1)                      BNETD User's Manual                     BNBOT(1)

NAME
       bnbot - Battle.net text-based chat bot client

SYNOPSIS
       bnbot [options] servername [serverport]

DESCRIPTION
       bnbot is a simple program which will allow communication through the
       bot protocol of a Battle.net server from the command line.  Input from
       stdin is sent to the server and output from the server is send to
       stdout.  The interface is so simple that telnet(1) could be used.  The
       only complicating factor is that a control-C character must be sent to
       the server before any other input.

       It is hoped that this program can be used with a scripting language
       like expect(1) to make creation of chat bots for Unix easier.  To date,
       I don't know of anyone doing this.  This program may also be used to
       test bot login permissions for accounts.

       If no servername is specified, localhost is assumed.  If no serverport
       is specified, 6112 is assumed.

       -h --help --usage
              Print usage information and exit.

       -v --version
              Print its version number and exit.

BUGS
       The terminal settings are not consulted for keybindings.  The following
       are assumed:

       ^H     delete the character to the left of the cursor

       ^J     accept current line

       ^M (return)
              accept current line

       ^T     transpose the last two characters

       ^W     delete word to the left of the cursor

       ^U     delete the whole input line

       ^[ (escape)
              cancel the current input line

       ^? (delete)
