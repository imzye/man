NAME
     rl – RealTek 8129/8139 Fast Ethernet device driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device miibus
           device rl

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_rl_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The rl driver provides support for PCI Ethernet adapters and embedded
     controllers based on the RealTek 8129 and 8139 Fast Ethernet controller
     chips.

     The RealTek 8129/8139 series controllers use bus master DMA but do not
     use a descriptor-based data transfer mechanism.  The receiver uses a
     single fixed size ring buffer from which packets must be copied into
     mbufs.  For transmission, there are only four outbound packet address
     registers which require all outgoing packets to be stored as contiguous
     buffers.  Furthermore, outbound packet buffers must be longword aligned
     or else transmission will fail.

     The 8129 differs from the 8139 in that the 8139 has an internal PHY which
     is controlled through special direct access registers whereas the 8129
     uses an external PHY via an MII bus.  The 8139 supports both 10 and
     100Mbps speeds in either full or half duplex.  The 8129 can support the
     same speeds and modes given an appropriate PHY chip.

     Note: support for the 8139C+ chip is provided by the re(4) driver.

     The rl driver supports the following media types:

     autoselect            Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
                           This is only supported if the PHY chip attached to
                           the RealTek controller supports NWAY
                           autonegotiation.  The user can manually override
                           the autoselected mode by adding media options to
                           the /etc/rc.conf file.

     10baseT/UTP           Set 10Mbps operation.  The mediaopt option can also
                           be used to select either full-duplex or half-duplex
                           modes.

     100baseTX             Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.  The
                           mediaopt option can also be used to select either
                           full-duplex or half-duplex modes.

     The rl driver supports the following media options:

     full-duplex           Force full duplex operation.

     half-duplex           Force half duplex operation.

     Note that the 100baseTX media type is only available if supported by the
     adapter.  For more information on configuring this device, see
     ifconfig(8).

LOADER TUNABLES
     dev.rl.%unit.prefer_iomap
             This tunable controls which register mapping should be used on
             the specified device.  A non-zero value enables I/O space
             register mapping.  For controllers that have no I/O space
             register mapping this tunable should be set to 0 to use memory
             space register mapping.  The default value is 1 to use I/O space
             register mapping.

     dev.rl.%unit.twister_enable
             Non-zero value enables the long cable tuning on the specified
             device.  Disabled by default.

DIAGNOSTICS
     rl%d: couldn't map memory  A fatal initialization error has occurred.

     rl%d: couldn't map interrupt  A fatal initialization error has occurred.

     rl%d: watchdog timeout  The device has stopped responding to the network,
     or there is a problem with the network connection (cable).

     rl%d: no memory for rx list  The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for
     the receiver ring.

     rl%d: no memory for tx list  The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for
     the transmitter ring when allocating a pad buffer or collapsing an mbuf
     chain into a cluster.

     rl%d: chip is in D3 power state -- setting to D0  This message applies
     only to adapters which support power management.  Some operating systems
     place the controller in low power mode when shutting down, and some PCI
     BIOSes fail to bring the chip out of this state before configuring it.
     The controller loses all of its PCI configuration in the D3 state, so if
     the BIOS does not set it back to full power mode in time, it will not be
     able to configure it correctly.  The driver tries to detect this
     condition and bring the adapter back to the D0 (full power) state, but
     this may not be enough to return the driver to a fully operational
     condition.  If you see this message at boot time and the driver fails to
     attach the device as a network interface, you will have to perform second
     warm boot to have the device properly configured.

     Note that this condition only occurs when warm booting from another
     operating system.  If you power down your system prior to booting
     FreeBSD, the card should be configured correctly.

HISTORY
     The rl device driver first appeared in FreeBSD 3.0.

AUTHORS
     The rl driver was written by Bill Paul <wpaul@ctr.columbia.edu>.

BUGS
     Since outbound packets must be longword aligned, the transmit routine has
     to copy an unaligned packet into an mbuf cluster buffer before
     transmission.  The driver abuses the fact that the cluster buffer pool is
     allocated at system startup time in a contiguous region starting at a
     page boundary.  Since cluster buffers are 2048 bytes, they are longword
     aligned by definition.  The driver probably should not be depending on
     this characteristic.

     The RealTek data sheets are of especially poor quality, and there is a
     lot of information missing particularly concerning the receiver
     operation.  One particularly important fact that the data sheets fail to
     mention relates to the way in which the chip fills in the receive buffer.
     When an interrupt is posted to signal that a frame has been received, it
     is possible that another frame might be in the process of being copied
     into the receive buffer while the driver is busy handling the first one.
     If the driver manages to finish processing the first frame before the
     chip is done DMAing the rest of the next frame, the driver may attempt to
     process the next frame in the buffer before the chip has had a chance to
     finish DMAing all of it.

     The driver can check for an incomplete frame by inspecting the frame
     length in the header preceding the actual packet data: an incomplete
     frame will have the magic length of 0xFFF0.  When the driver encounters
     this value, it knows that it has finished processing all currently
     available packets.  Neither this magic value nor its significance are
     documented anywhere in the RealTek data sheets.
