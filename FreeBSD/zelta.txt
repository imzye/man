zelta-backup(8)             System Manager’s Manual            zelta-backup(8)

NAME
       zelta backup, zelta sync, zelta clone - Perform a recursive replication
       operation.

SYNOPSIS
       zelta backup [-bcdDeeFhhLMpuVw] [-iIjnpqRtTv] [initiator]
       source-endpoint target-endpoint

       zelta sync [-bcdDeeFhhLMpuVw] [-iIjnpqRtTv] [initiator] source-endpoint
       target-endpoint

       zelta clone [-d depth] source-dataset target-dataset

DESCRIPTION
       zelta backup and zelta sync attempt to intelligently replicate
       snapshots from a source ZFS dataset endpoint to a target.  zelta backup
       optimizes for complete backups of all snapshots by default using a
       careful LBYL strategy, appropriate for typical backup jobs.  zelta sync
       optimizes for efficiency using an EAFP strategy, appropriate for
       time-sensitive operations or controlled environemnts.  Endpoints may be
       remotely accessible via SSH.  As with zfs receive, the target dataset
       endpoint must not exist or be an replica of the source.

       Zelta is designed for simplicity and safety and is suitable for a
       backup server replicating datasets from many systems.  To ensure safe
       operation, the following default options are set for new replication
       targets: 1.  The property readonly=on will be set.  2.  Filesystems
       will not be mounted.  3.  On filesystems, the property canmount=noauto
       will be set.  4.  On filesystems, mountpoints will be inherited
       (discarded) to prevent overlapping mounts.

       These defaults, as well as snapshot naming scheme and many other
       assumptions, can be modified with arguments or via the environment (see
       zelta.env.example for more information).

OPTIONS
       See the manuals for zfs-send(8) and zfs-receive(8) for detail on
       pass-through options listed below.

       [-bcdDeeFhhLMpuVw] [–zfs-send-option]
              Pass any unambiguous dashed or double-dashed option to all zfs
              send and zfs receive operations.  Note that some options, such
              as -s, are ambiguous and must be set using the environment
              instead.  Some options, such as -I, work differently in zelta
              <backup|sync>, and are described in detail below.

       -I This is the default mode for zelta backup.  Replicate intermediate
       incremental streams from the source and target’s matching dataset to
       the newest.  If the target is new, all avaialble source snapshots will
       be replicated.

       -i: This is the default mode for zelta sync.  Only replicate the latest
       stream from the source to the target.  If the target is new, only the
       latest source snapshot will be replicated.

       -n, –dryrun
              Run with dry run mode.  Don’t replicate, but show zfs
              <clone|create|get|receive|send> commands that would be run.
              Note that zelta match, zfs list, and zfs send -n which are used
              to determine the anticipated replication operation will not be
              displayed.

       -j,–json
              Produce JSON output for the replication job, suppressing all
              other output.  Stream names and error messages will be included
              in lists inside the JSON block.  Incremental streams will be
              listed in the format:
              @earliest-snapshot::dataset@latest-snapshot

       -p, –progress
              Attempt to use a progress viewer.  pv will be used by default,
              otherwise dd status=progress will be used.

       -q Reduce verbosity.

       -V Increase verbosity.

       -R Not recommended.  Sets --depth=1 and passes -R to the zfs send.  See
       zfs-send(8) for details.

       -d depth, –depth depth
              Limits the depth of all Zelta operations.

EXAMPLES
       Note that the same command can be used for new and existing target
       datasets.

       Local synchronization: Synchronize a dataset and all of its snapshots
       from a local source dataset to a local target dataset, creating a
       snapshot only if necessary to get the latest data.

              zelta backup tank/source/dataset tank/target/dataset

       Migrate remote data to localhost: Create a snapshot and replicate it
       from a remote source to a local target, only if the source has new
       written data.

              zelta sync -ss remote_host:tank/source/dataset tank/target/dataset

       Dry Run: Display the zfs send and zfs receive commands without
       executing them.

              zelta backup -n tank/source/dataset tank/target/dataset
