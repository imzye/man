NAME
       relative - Load modules with relative names

VERSION
       Version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
           package BigApp::Report;

           use relative qw(Create Publish);
           # loads BigApp::Report::Create, BigApp::Report::Publish

           use relative qw(..::Utils);
           # loads BigApp::Utils

           use relative -to => "Enterprise::Framework" => qw(Base Factory);
           # loads Enterprise::Framework::Base, Enterprise::Framework::Factory

DESCRIPTION
       This module allows you to load modules using only parts of their name,
       relatively to the current module or to a given module. Module names are
       by default searched below the current module, but can be searched upper
       in the hierarchy using the "..::" syntax.

       In order to further loosen the namespace coupling, "import" returns the
       full names of the loaded modules, making object-oriented code easier to
       write:

           use relative;

           my ($Maker, $Publisher) = import relative qw(Create Publish);
           my $report    = $Maker->new;
           my $publisher = $Publisher->new;

           my ($Base, $Factory) = import relative -to => "Enterprise::Framework"
                                       => qw(Base Factory);
           my $thing = $Factory->new;

       This can also be written using aliases:

           use relative -aliased => qw(Create Publish);
           my $report    = Create->new;
           my $publisher = Publisher->new;

           use relative -to => "Enterprise::Framework", -aliased => qw(Base Factory);
           my $thing = Factory->new;

IMPORT OPTIONS
       Import options can be given as an hashref or an arrayref as the first
       argument:

           # options as a hashref
           import relative { param => value, ... },  qw(Name ...);

           # options as an arrayref
           import relative [ param => value, ... ],  qw(Name ...);

       In order to simplyfing syntax, options can also be given as dash-
       prefixed params:

           import relative -param => value, qw(name ...);

       Available options:

       •   "to" can be used to indicate another hierarchy to search modules
           inside.

           Examples

               # in a hashref:
               import relative { to => "Some::Other::Namespace" }, qw(Other Modules);

               # as dash-param:
               import relative -to => "Some::Other::Namespace", qw(Other Modules);

       •   "aliased" will create constants, named with the last component of
           each loaded module, returning its corresponding full name. Yes,
           this feature is very similar to what "aliased" does as it was added
           per Ovid request ":-)"

           Examples

               # in a hashref:
               import relative { aliased => 1 }, qw(Whack Zlonk);
               my $frob = Whack->fizzle;

               # as dash-param:
               import relative -aliased, qw(Whack Zlonk);
               my $frob = Whack->fizzle;

       "import" will "die" as soon as a module can't be loaded.

       "import" returns the full names of the loaded modules when called in
       list context, or the last one when called in scalar context.
