NAME
       tracker-extract - Extract metadata from a file.


SYNOPSYS
       tracker extract FILE


DESCRIPTION
       tracker extract reads the file provided and extracts any metadata it
       can from this file, then displays the metadata on standard output.

       The metadata is displayed as a SPARQL update command, that can be run
       against a SPARQL endpoint to update its copy of the metadata.

       The actual extraction is done by a separate process. This is done to
       isolate the calling process from any memory leaks or crashes in the
       libraries Tracker uses to extract metadata.

       For more information see the libtracker-extract reference
       documentation.


OPTIONS
       -v, --verbosity=<LEVEL>
              This sets the log verbosity for the extractor process.

              The possible LEVEL options are:

               •   debug - Show EVERYTHING, from debug messages to errors.

               •   detailed - Show enough detail to understand what is
                   happening.

               •   minimal - Show an overview of what is going on

               •   errors - Show only warnings, criticals, errors or fatal
                   events.


       -o, --output-format=<FORMAT>
              Choose which format to use to output results. Supported formats
              are sparql, turtle and json-ld.


EXAMPLES
       Using command line to extract metadata from a file:

              $ tracker extract /path/to/some/file.mp3


ENVIRONMENT
       TRACKER_EXTRACTORS_DIR
              This is the directory which tracker uses to load the shared
              libraries from (used for extracting metadata for specific file
              types). These are needed on each invocation of tracker-store. If
              unset it will default to the correct place. This is used mainly
              for testing purposes. The default location is
              /usr/lib/tracker-1.0/extract-modules/.

       TRACKER_EXTRACTOR_RULES_DIR
              This is the directory which tracker uses to load the rules files
              from.  The rules files describe extractor modules and their
              supported MIME types. The default location is
              /usr/share/tracker/extract-rules/.

       TRACKER_USE_CONFIG_FILES
              Don't use GSettings, instead use a config file similar to how
              settings were saved in 0.10.x. That is, a file which is much
              like an .ini file.  These are saved to $HOME/.config/tracker/
