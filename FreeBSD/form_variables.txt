NAME
       TYPE_ALNUM, TYPE_ALPHA, TYPE_ENUM, TYPE_INTEGER, TYPE_IPV4,
       TYPE_NUMERIC, TYPE_REGEXP - form system global variables

SYNOPSIS
       #include <form.h>

       FIELDTYPE * TYPE_ALNUM;
       FIELDTYPE * TYPE_ALPHA;
       FIELDTYPE * TYPE_ENUM;
       FIELDTYPE * TYPE_INTEGER;
       FIELDTYPE * TYPE_IPV4;
       FIELDTYPE * TYPE_NUMERIC;
       FIELDTYPE * TYPE_REGEXP;

DESCRIPTION
       These are building blocks for the form library, defining fields that
       can be created using set_fieldtype(3X).  Each provides functions for
       field- and character-validation, according to the given datatype.

   TYPE_ALNUM
       This holds alphanumeric data.

   TYPE_ALPHA
       This holds alphabetic data.

   TYPE_ENUM
       This holds an enumerated type.

   TYPE_INTEGER
       This holds a decimal integer.

   TYPE_IPV4
       This holds an IPv4 internet address, e.g., "127.0.0.1".

   TYPE_NUMERIC
       This holds a decimal number, with optional sign and decimal point.

   TYPE_REGEXP
       This holds a regular expression.

PORTABILITY
       The TYPE_IPV4 variable is an extension not provided by older
       implementations of the form library.
