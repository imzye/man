NAME
       Image::Base::SVG -- SVG image file output

SYNOPSIS
        use Image::Base::SVG;
        my $image = Image::Base::SVG->new (-width => 100,
                                           -height => 100);
        $image->rectangle (0,0, 99,99, 'black');
        $image->xy (20,20, 'green');
        $image->line (50,50, 70,70, 'red');
        $image->line (50,50, 70,70, 'blue');
        $image->save ('/some/filename.svg');

CLASS HIERARCHY
       "Image::Base::SVG" is a subclass of "Image::Base",

           Image::Base
             Image::Base::SVG

DESCRIPTION
       "Image::Base::SVG" extends "Image::Base" to create or update SVG format
       image files using the "SVG" module.  The "SVG" module holds the
       contents of an SVG file in memory as an object which can be variously
       manipulated.  See SVG::Manual for details.

       "Image::Base" is pixel oriented so isn't really the sort of thing SVG
       is meant for, but this module can direct "Image::Base" style code at an
       "SVG" object.  The "SVG" module has many more features if used
       natively.

       It's often fairly easy to spit out SVG directly too, and for instance
       the "Image::Base::SVGout" module can do that.  The advantage of the
       "SVG" object comes when combining images or fragments, or going through
       elements for post-facto mangling.

       In the current code the SVG elements emitted assume some default style
       attributes such as stroke-width 1.  Perhaps that should be set
       explicitly on each element.

   Colours
       Colour names are per the SVG spec, which is CSS style syntax

           #RGB                    hex, 1 digit
           #RRGGBB                 hex, 2 digit
           rgb(255,255,255)        integers 0 to 255
           rgb(100%,100%,100%)     percentages

       plus extra names

FUNCTIONS
       See "FUNCTIONS" in Image::Base for the behaviour common to all Image-
       Base classes.

       "$image = Image::Base::SVG->new (key=>value,...)"
           Create and return a new image object.  A new image can be started
           with just

               $image = Image::Base::SVG->new;

           Generally "-width" and "-height" should be set, but it works to do
           that later after creating.

           Or an existing "SVG" object can be given,

               my $svg = SVG->new;
               ...
               $image = Image::Base::SVG->new (-svg_object => $svg);

       "$image->xy ($x, $y, $colour)"
       "$colour = $image->xy ($x, $y)"
           Get or set an individual pixel.

           Currently for a get the return is always "undef" as there's no
           support for picking out elements etc from the SVG.  Perhaps the
           simple elements drawn by this "Image::Base::SVG" could be read
           back, but arbitrary SVG from a load() would need a full rasterize
           in the worst case.

       "$image->load ()"
       "$image->load ($filename)"
           Load an SVG file into $image, either from the current "-file"
           attribute, or set that to $filename then load.

           This uses the "SVG::Parser" module.  See that module for how to
           choose between Expat or SAX for its underlying XML parse, and see
           in turn XML::SAX for its further choice of libxml, pure perl, etc.
           LibXML might be unhelpfully strict.

       "$image->save ()"
       "$image->save ($filename)"
           Save the image to an SVG file, either the current "-file" option,
           or set that option to $filename and save to there.

ATTRIBUTES
       "-width" (integer)
       "-height" (integer)
           Setting "-width" or "-height" changes the SVG canvas size.  In the
           current code it doesn't affect the elements already drawn to it.
           Is that how it should be?
