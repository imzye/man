DESCRIPTION
       This module provide an object interface to tempdir() from File::Temp.
       This allow to destroy the temporary directory as soon you don't need it
       anymore using the magic DESTROY() function automatically call be perl
       when the object is no longer reference.

       If a value is passed to at object creation, it become only a container
       allowing to keep same code in your function.

FUNCTIONS
   new(@options)
       if @options is only one defined value, the directory is simply retain
       in memory and will not been trashed.

       Otherwise, @options are same than tempdir() from File::Temp.  Refer to
       File::Temp documentation to have options list.  In this case, the
       directory will be trashed.

   name
       Return the name of the directory handle by the object.
