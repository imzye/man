FTPSESAME(8)            FreeBSD System Manager's Manual           FTPSESAME(8)

NAME
     ftpsesame – automagic packet filter configurator for FTP

SYNOPSIS
     ftpsesame [-d] [-D level] [-i interface] [-t tag] [-q queue] [expression]

DESCRIPTION
     ftpsesame tracks FTP control connections to be able to timely add pf(4)
     packet filter rules that allow active and passive FTP data transfers to
     commence.  This results in the efficiency of a packet filter, and the
     fine-grained control of a proxy.  It can run on both FTP clients and FTP
     servers, or a firewall in front thereof.

     ftpsesame uses bpf(4) to get a copy of the data inside FTP control
     connections passing the specified interface.  This data is searched for
     negotiations about data connections.  For passive mode, this is a port
     that a client should use to connect to a server.  For active mode this is
     a port and an IP address that a server should use to connect to a client.

     Assuming the FTP control connection is from $client to $server, and $port
     is negotiated, ftpsesame adds one of the following rules to pf(4), inside
     an anchor named "ftpsesame".

     In case of active mode (PORT or EPRT):

       pass in log quick inet proto tcp \
           from $server to $client port $port flags S/SAFR keep state

     In case of passive mode (PASV or EPSV):

       pass in log quick inet proto tcp \
           from $client to $server port $port flags S/SAFR keep state

     In the special case of passive mode where the client is subject to NAT,
     an extra rule is added, where $client_real is the client's real IP
     address:

       pass in log quick inet proto tcp \
           from $client_real to $server port $port flags S/SAFR keep state

     The options are as follows:

     -D level
             Debug level, ranging from 0 to 7.  Higher is more verbose.  The
             default is 5.  (These levels correspond to the syslog(3) levels.)

     -d      Do not daemonize.  The process will stay in the foreground,
             logging to stderr.

     -i interface
             Listen on interface.

     -t tag  Create rules with tag tag.  Also, option quick is not used.  This
             way the anchor always returns to the main ruleset, with the tag
             set on approved FTP data connections.  The tag can then be used
             in pass rules below the anchor.

     -q queue
             Create rules with queue queue appended.

     expression
             Selects the packets that bpf(4) will pass on to ftpsesame. An
             expression consist of the primitives described in tcpdump(8).
             For efficiency, the expression should narrow down the traffic as
             much as possible.  The default is "tcp and port 21".

CONFIGURATION EXAMPLES
     To use the rules set up by ftpsesame, pf.conf(5) should be modified to
     use the anchor.  Below are examples that show most of the possibilities.

       # (1) Allow internal LAN to access FTP servers anywhere.
       #     (passive mode only if $lan is subject to NAT, see below)
       # cmd: ftpsesame -i $ext_if
       anchor "ftpsesame/*" on { $int_if, $ext_if }
       pass in  quick on $int_if proto tcp from $lan to any port 21 keep state
       pass out quick on $ext_if proto tcp from $lan to any port 21 keep state

       # (2) Allow access to FTP servers in the DMZ, while queueing the data
       #     transfers.
       # cmd: ftpsesame -i $dmz_if -q ftp
       queue ftp bandwidth 10%
       # passive
       anchor "ftpsesame/*" in  on $ext_if proto tcp from any to { $ftp_servers }
       anchor "ftpsesame/*" out on $dmz_if proto tcp from any to { $ftp_servers }
       # active
       anchor "ftpsesame/*" in  on $dmz_if proto tcp from { $ftp_servers } to any
       anchor "ftpsesame/*" out on $ext_if proto tcp from { $ftp_servers } to any
       # ... rules for port 21 omitted ...

       # (3) Allow access to FTP servers in the DMZ, using tagging for fine
       #     grained control.
       # cmd: ftpsesame -i $dmz_if -t ftpok
       anchor "ftpsesame/*"
       # passive
       pass in  quick on $ext_if proto tcp from to any to $realftp \
           port > 49151 tagged ftpok keep state
       pass in  quick on $ext_if proto tcp from any to $msftp \
           port 1023 >< 5001 tagged ftpok keep state
       pass out quick on $dmz_if all tagged ftpok keep state
       # active
       pass in  quick on $dmz_if proto tcp from $realftp to any \
           tagged ftpok keep state
       pass in  quick on $dmz_if proto tcp from $msftp port 20 to any \
           tagged ftpok keep state
       pass out quick on $ext_if all tagged ftpok keep state
       # ... rules for port 21 omitted ...

     Keep state is mandatory on the control connection (port 21), because
     ftpsesame checks that these connections are in the statetable, before
     allowing data connections.

NAT ISSUES
     To enable passive mode connections from clients subject to NAT, ftpsesame
     must listen on the interface where the NAT has already taken place,
     typically the external interface.  Otherwise ftpsesame cannot add the
     extra rule with the real client address.  Note that this does not have to
     be a problem, if there are other rules taking care of that.

     Active mode connections from clients subject to NAT are not supported,
     because it requires commands inside the control connection to be
     rewritten.  ftp-proxy(8) can be used for that purpose.

SECURITY
     Ports below 1024 are not allowed.

     The negotiated IP address for active mode is ignored for security
     reasons.  This makes third party file transfers impossible.

     ftpsesame checks that the ftp control connection is in the packet filter
     statetable before it will trust its contents.

     ftpsesame chroots to "/var/empty" and changes to user "proxy" to drop
     privileges.  It does keep a file descriptor to both bpf(4) and pf(4) so
     it is still very powerful.

     The concept of rebuilding a TCP session from IP packets on a passive
     listener is fundamentally flawed.  ftpsesame would need a full TCP stack
     that emulates each endpoint perfectly to be safe from all evasion
     techniques.  ftp-proxy(8) does not have this problem.  Ofcourse ftpsesame
     tries hard to detect irregularities.  The following are not allowed: IP
     options, IP fragments, ttl below 2, lines without end-of-line marker.
     Also, ftpsesame only looks at the first line of whatever the server has
     to say in response to a client.

     It is recommended to run ftpsesame on an interface where packets from
     untrusted hosts are already scrubbed.  Also, anchors and tags can be used
     to restrict the allowed addresses and portranges.

CAVEATS
     There is always a slight delay before a rule gets added to the anchor.
     If the data connection is opened within this period, it will get blocked.
     If ftpsesame runs on a firewall between the client and server, this only
     introduces a slight delay, as TCP will retry within seconds.  If
     ftpsesame runs on a client or server itself, the network stack reacts
     differently on blocked packets ("no route to host") and either active or
     passive may mode not work.
