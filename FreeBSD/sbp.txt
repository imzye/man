SBP(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 SBP(4)

NAME
     sbp – Serial Bus Protocol 2 (SBP-2) Mass Storage Devices driver

SYNOPSIS
     kldload firewire
     kldload cam
     kldload sbp

     or

     device sbp
     device firewire
     device scbus
     device da
     device cd
     device pass

DESCRIPTION
     The sbp driver provides support for SBP-2 devices that attach to the
     FireWire (IEEE 1394) port.  It should work with SBP-2 devices which the
     CAM layer supports, for example, HDDs, CDROM drives and DVD drives.

     Some users familiar with umass(4) might wonder why the device is not
     detached at the CAM layer when the device is unplugged.  It is detached
     only if the device has not been plugged again during several bus resets.
     This is for preventing to detach an active file system even when the
     device cannot be probed correctly for some reason after a bus reset or
     when the device is temporary disconnected because the user changes the
     bus topology.  If you want to force to detach the device, run “fwcontrol
     -r” several times or set hw.firewire.hold_count=0 by sysctl(8).

     Some (broken) HDDs do not work well with tagged queuing.  If you have
     problems with such drives, try “camcontrol [device id] tags -N 1” to
     disable tagged queuing.
