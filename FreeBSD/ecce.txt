NAME
     ecce – Edinburgh Compatible Context Editor

SYNOPSIS
     ecce -from inputfile [-to outputfile] [-log logfile] [-size bytes]

DESCRIPTION
     ecce is a line-based text editor. It first appeared many years ago at the
     University of Edinburgh, and has been re-implemented many times.  Thuis
     manual page does not attempt to be an ecce tutorial; it merely details
     how to invoke ecce, and summarises the basic commands.  For more details,
     see the full documentation.

     When invoking ecce, there is no need to precede arguments with flags if
     they are given in the order shown above. If an argument is omitted, the
     next agument must be specified using the appropriate flag.

     To create a new file, an empty input file must be specified. A suitable
     file is /dev/null.

BASIC COMMANDS
     The operation of ecce is directed by a series of commands which are typed
     by the user. Each command line consists of a single command, or a
     sequence of several commands terminated by a newline.  No command
     separator is required between individual commands, and unquoted spaces
     are not significant. The individual commands in a command sequence are
     executed from left to right. The basic editing commands consist of a
     letter, or a letter followed by a text string.  The letter is mnemonic
     for an imperative verb. The text string is any sequence of characters
     (excluding newline) enclosed within quotation marks. Any command may be
     followed by a repetition number to indicate that the command is to be
     executed repeatedly the number of times specified. Compound commands may
     be formed by enclosing a sequence of commands within parentheses.

   Editing commands
     In the following list, the Notes column indicates the notes pertaining to
     the particular command. These can indicate how a command can `fail', or
     other relevant information about the command.

COMPOUND COMMANDS
     Sequences of commands may be enclosed in parentheses to form compound
     commands.

     Commands may be repeated, unconditionally or conditionally.

     Operation Example       Meaning/Effect
     0 or *                  indefinite repetition
                             (repeat until failure)"
               r0            move file pointer to end of line
               (mr)0         find first blank line
               e-0           erase backwards to start of line


     ?                       optional execution
                             (failure condition is ignored)
               ((r61p)?m)0   print lines with more than 60 characters


     ,                       alternative execution
                             (if first fails, execute next etc.)
               (r81lb,m)0    split lines with more than 80 characters
               (f/print/(v/printstring/,e5i/write/))*
                             replace print by write except in printstring


     \                       inverted failure
               (mv'+'\)0     find next line starting with `+'

     A command line consisting solely of a number repeats the previous command
     line the number of times specified.

     Patterns may be delimited by any character except letters, digits and
     those which have defined significance: for example, one can use:
     " / $ > + . : = _

FILES
     /tmp/eccesaveNNNNNN        Emergency save file. This is used when ecce
                                cannot write to the original file being
                                edited. NNNNNN is the zero-filled process ID.
     /tmp/eccenoteXNNNNNN       Context file. These are used for holding
                                secondary contexts, and are not deleted when
                                ecce exits. X is the context number, and
                                NNNNNN is the zero-filled process ID.

DIAGNOSTICS
     The ecce utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

     Note that only the first reference is definitive for this implementation,
     so some commands may be missing (or added) elsewhere.  However, the other
     documents may provide a good way of learning how to use ecce effectively.
