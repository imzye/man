GSS_UNWRAP(3)       FreeBSD Library Functions Manual (prm)       GSS_UNWRAP(3)

NAME
     gss_unwrap, gss_unseal – Convert a message previously protected by
     gss_wrap(3) back to a usable form

SYNOPSIS
     #include <gssapi/gssapi.h>

     OM_uint32
     gss_unwrap(OM_uint32 *minor_status, const gss_ctx_id_t context_handle,
         const gss_buffer_t input_message_buffer,
         gss_buffer_t output_message_buffer, int *conf_state,
         gss_qop_t *qop_state);

     OM_uint32
     gss_unseal(OM_uint32 *minor_status, gss_ctx_id_t context_handle,
         gss_buffer_t input_message_buffer,
         gss_buffer_t output_message_buffer, int *conf_state,
         gss_qop_t *qop_state);

DESCRIPTION
     Converts a message previously protected by gss_wrap(3) back to a usable
     form, verifying the embedded MIC.  The conf_state parameter indicates
     whether the message was encrypted; the qop_state parameter indicates the
     strength of protection that was used to provide the confidentiality and
     integrity services.

     Since some application-level protocols may wish to use tokens emitted by
     gss_wrap(3) to provide "secure framing", implementations must support the
     wrapping and unwrapping of zero-length messages.

     The gss_unseal() routine is an obsolete variant of gss_unwrap().  It is
     provided for backwards compatibility with applications using the GSS-API
     V1 interface.  A distinct entrypoint (as opposed to #define) is provided,
     both to allow GSS-API V1 applications to link and to retain the slight
     parameter type differences between the obsolete versions of this routine
     and its current form.

PARAMETERS
     minor_status               Mechanism specific status code.

     context_handle             Identifies the context on which the message
                                arrived.

     input_message_buffer       Protected message.

     output_message_buffer      Buffer to receive unwrapped message.  Storage
                                associated with this buffer must be freed by
                                the application after use with a call to
                                gss_release_buffer(3).

     conf_state

                                Non-zero  Confidentiality and integrity
                                          protection were used.

                                Zero      Integrity service only was used.

                                Specify NULL if not required.

     qop_state                  Quality of protection provided. Specify NULL
                                if not required.

RETURN VALUES
     GSS_S_COMPLETE             Successful completion.

     GSS_S_DEFECTIVE_TOKEN      The token failed consistency checks.

     GSS_S_BAD_SIG              The MIC was incorrect

     GSS_S_DUPLICATE_TOKEN      The token was valid, and contained a correct
                                MIC for the message, but it had already been
                                processed.

     GSS_S_OLD_TOKEN            The token was valid, and contained a correct
                                MIC for the message, but it is too old to
                                check for duplication.

     GSS_S_UNSEQ_TOKEN          The token was valid, and contained a correct
                                MIC for the message, but has been verified out
                                of sequence; a later token has already been
                                received.

     GSS_S_GAP_TOKEN            The token was valid, and contained a correct
                                MIC for the message, but has been verified out
                                of sequence; an earlier expected token has not
                                yet been received.

     GSS_S_CONTEXT_EXPIRED      The context has already expired.

     GSS_S_NO_CONTEXT           The context_handle parameter did not identify
                                a valid context.
