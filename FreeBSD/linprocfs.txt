LINPROCFS(5)              FreeBSD File Formats Manual             LINPROCFS(5)

NAME
     linprocfs – Linux process file system

SYNOPSIS
     linproc         /compat/linux/proc      linprocfs       rw 0 0

DESCRIPTION
     The Linux process file system, or linprocfs, emulates a subset of Linux'
     process file system and is required for the complete operation of some
     Linux binaries.

     The linprocfs provides a two-level view of process space.  At the highest
     level, processes themselves are named, according to their process ids in
     decimal, with no leading zeros.  There is also a special node called self
     which always refers to the process making the lookup request.

     Each node is a directory containing several files:

     exe     A reference to the vnode from which the process text was read.
             This can be used to gain access to the process' symbol table, or
             to start another copy of the process.

     mem     The complete virtual memory image of the process.  Only those
             addresses which exist in the process can be accessed.  Reads and
             writes to this file modify the process.  Writes to the text
             segment remain private to the process.

     Each node is owned by the process's user, and belongs to that user's
     primary group, except for the mem node, which belongs to the kmem group.

FILES
     /compat/linux/proc               The normal mount point for the
                                      linprocfs.
     /compat/linux/proc/cpuinfo       CPU vendor and model information in
                                      human-readable form.
     /compat/linux/proc/meminfo       System memory information in human-
                                      readable form.
     /compat/linux/proc/pid           A directory containing process
                                      information for process pid.
     /compat/linux/proc/self          A directory containing process
                                      information for the current process.
     /compat/linux/proc/self/exe      The executable image for the current
                                      process.
     /compat/linux/proc/self/mem      The complete virtual address space of
                                      the current process.
