VERSION
       version 0.6807

SYNOPSIS
           use Mail::LMLM;

           my $renderer =
               Mail::LMLM->new(
                   'extra-classes' => \%extra_mailing_list_classes,
                   title => "List of the Foo Mailing Lists",
                   headline => "Foo Mailing Lists",
                   lists => \@lists,
                   prolog =>  \&prolog,
                   epilog => \&epilog,
               );

           $renderer->render();

DESCRIPTION
       The Mail::LMLM module allows users to easily manage HTML directories of
       mailing lists of various mailing list managers and hosts.

       To use it create a new module of type Mail::LMLM with a new method,
       while initializing it with the list of mailing lists (in order of
       listing), and other parameters. Then, invoke the render() function to
       create the HTML files within the current directory.

       Following is a listing of the parameters

   title and headline
       title is what will be displayed in the document inside the <title> tag.
       headline is the headline of the main page.

   prolog and epilog
       prolog is a callback for a function that will be called with the
       Mail::LMLM handle and its appropriate rendering back-end when the
       main's page prologue (that comes before the listing itself) is to be
       displayed. epilog is the same for the text after the listing itself.
       Here is an example for it:

           sub prolog
           {
               my $self = shift;
               my $main_r = shift;

               $main_r->para( "This is a list of the mailing-lists which are affiliated " .
                   "with the Israeli Group of Linux Users (IGLU). It includes such " .
                   "information as how to subscribe/unsubscribe, posting address, " .
                   "posting guidelines, the address of the mailing-list owner, the " .
                   "mailing-list's homepage and the online messages archive."
               );

               $main_r->start_para();
               $main_r->text("If you have any comments, suggestions or additions " .
                   "regarding the information contained here, don't hesitate to " .
                   "contact the maintainer of these pages at the following e-mail: ");

               $main_r->email_address("shlomif", "shlomifish.org");
               $main_r->end_para();
           }

       For more information on how to interface with the renderer consult the
       HTML::LMLM::Render reference page.

   extra-classes
       This is a reference to a hash whose keys are extra IDs for mailing
       lists classes, and its values are either the namespace of the Perl
       module that implements this class, or a subroutine that creates a new
       class like that.

       This class would be better be sub-classed from one of the classes that
       ship with Mail::LMLM. To see examples of how to sub-class, consult the
       examples section of the Mail::LMLM distribution.

   lists
       This is a reference to an array of hash references that contain the
       information for the mailing lists. The fields available here are:

       id      The identifier of the mailing list that will be used as the
               base name for its HTML page.

       class   The class of the mailing list that determines its type.
               Available built-in classes are: egroups (A Yahoo-Groups mailing
               list), ezmlm (an Ezmlm-based mailing list), listar (a Listar-
               based mailing list), listserv ( a Listserv-based mailing list),
               mailman (a mailman based mailing list), majordomo (a majordomo-
               based mailing list).

       group_base
               The group base that appears before the host.

       title   The title that will be displayed at the head of the page.

       hostname
               The hostname of the mailing list address.

       homepage
               The homepage URL of the mailing list.

       description
               The description of the mailing list, to be presented in its
               page.

               This can be an handle/Mail::LMLM::Render callback.

       guidelines
               The posting guidelines for the mailing list.

       online_archive
               A URL or a Mail::LMLM::Render callback for displaying the
               online archive of the mailing list.

       internal use only.
