SYNOPSIS
       filter [--version --help]

DESCRIPTION
       The GNU Talkfilters are filter programs that convert ordinary English
       text into text that mimics a stereotyped or otherwise humorous dialect.
       Each program reads from standard input and writes to standard output.

       Since the filters do word and substring substitution on the text they
       process, any word-wrap formatting of the original text will not be
       preserved. Use the wrap filter to word-wrap the output of a talk
       filter.
