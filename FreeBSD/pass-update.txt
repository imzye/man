NAME
       pass-update - A pass(1) extension that provides an easy flow for
       updating passwords.


SYNOPSIS
       pass update [options] pass-names...


DESCRIPTION
       pass update extends the pass utility with an update command providing
       an easy flow for updating passwords. It supports path, directory and
       wildcard update. Moreover, you can select how to update your passwords
       by automatically generating new passwords or manually setting your own.

       pass update assumes that the first line of the password file is the
       password and so only ever updates the first line unless the --multiline
       option is specified.

       By default pass update prints the old password and wait for the user
       before generating a new one. This behaviour can be changed using the
       provided options.


COMMAND
       pass update [ --clip, -c ] [ --no-symbols, -n ] [ --provide, -p ]
       [--length=<size>, -l <size>]
                   [ --include=<regex>, -i <regex> ] [ --exclude=<regex>,
              -e=<regex> ] [ --edit, -E ]
                   [ --multiline, -m ] pass-names...

              Update the password provided: print the password and wait for
              the user to generate a new one.

              pass-names can refer either to password store path(s) or
              directory. Both path and directory can be given in the same
              command. When updating a directory, all the passwords in this
              directory are updated. Wildcard update is supported by quoting
              '*' sign.

              Both old and newly generated password can optionally be written
              on the clipboard using the --clip or -c option.

              If --no-symbols or -n is specified, do not use any non-
              alphanumeric characters in the generated password.

              Specific password length can be given using --length or -l is
              specified, along with a numerical argument.

              If --provide or -p is specified, let the user specify a password
              by hand. The user will have to confirm the password.

              If --multiline or -m is specified, update a multiline password.
              Beware this option will overwrite the full password file instead
              of updating the password field.

              If --include or -i is specified, Only update the passwords that
              match a given regex.

              If --exclude or -e is specified, Do not update the passwords
              that match a given regex.

              If --edit or -E is specified, edit the password using the
              default editor. This editor can be specified with EDITOR.

              If --force or -f is specified, pass update does not wait for the
              user and generate a new password immediately.
