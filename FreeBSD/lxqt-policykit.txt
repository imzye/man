lxqt-policykit-agent(1)           LXQt Module          lxqt-policykit-agent(1)

NAME
       lxqt-policykit-agent - Polkit agent for the LXQt desktop environment

SYNOPSIS
       lxqt-policykit-agent

DESCRIPTION
       This module manages PolicyKit for LXQt. The authentication agent
       ensures that the session user verifies their identity by authenticating
       either as themselves or as an administrator.

       The LXQt modules are desktop independent tools and operate as daemons
       for the local user for desktop specific operations.

BEHAVIOR
       The module detects privilege escalation on shared resources and
       presents a security dialog requesting the user's password to proceed
       with the action.

AUTOSTART
       The module is only shown in LXQt desktop, but  it's possible to create
       an autostart action in other desktop environments.
