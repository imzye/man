PMAP_PAGE_EXISTS_QUICK(9)                    FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual

NAME
     pmap_page_exists_quick – determine if a page exists in a physical map

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <vm/vm.h>
     #include <vm/pmap.h>

     boolean_t
     pmap_page_exists_quick(pmap_t pmap, vm_page_t m);

DESCRIPTION
     The pmap_page_exists_quick() function is used to quickly determine if the
     page m exists in the physical map pmap.  It is typically called from the
     VM paging code.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
     The PV count used above may be changed upwards or downwards in future; it
     is only necessary that TRUE be returned for a small subset of pmaps for
     proper page aging.

RETURN VALUES
     The pmap_page_exists_quick() returns TRUE only if the PV entry for the
     physical map pmap is one of the first 16 PVs linked from the page m.
