NAME
       nxproxy - NX Proxy Tool

SYNOPSIS
       nxproxy [<options>] <host>:<port>


DESCRIPTION
       nxproxy is a tool that allows one to tunnel X sessions through the NX
       compression library. nxproxy is a backend application utilized by
       various client application (Remmina, X2Go Client, PyHoca-Gui, Arctica
       Client, TheQVD Client, etc.).

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
       -C      Specify that nxproxy has to run on the 'X client' side,
               listening for connections and impersonating an X server.

       -S      Specify that nxproxy has to run in 'X server' mode, thus
               forwarding the connections to daemons running on the client.

       -h      Print this message.

       -v      Print version information.

       -d <int>
               Set log level (0 for FATAL, 1 for ERROR, 2 for WARNING, 3 for
               INFO, 4 for DEBUG). The default is 0.

       -o <string>
               Name of the log file. Default is stderr.

       -f <string>
               Specify log format. The characters in <string> define how the
               loglines are formatted. The following characters are supported,
               default is '0':

               0       only the plain text without any additions. This is the
                       default.

               u       include time

               l       include loglevel

               T       include thread ids

               L       include the location of the log call in the source code

       <host>:<port>
               Put at the end, specifies the host and port of the listening
               proxy.


NX/NX DISPLAY OPTIONS
       Multiple nx/nx options can be specified in the DISPLAY environment or
       on the command line, by using the nx/nx,option=value notation.

       link=<string>
               An indication of the link speed that is going to be used
               between the proxies. Usually the compression and the other link
               parameters depend on this setting. The value can be either
               'modem', 'isdn', 'adsl', 'wan', 'lan', 'local' or a bandwidth
               specification, like for example '56k', '1m', '100m', etc.


       type=<string>
               Type of session, for example 'windows', 'unix-kde'. 'unix-
               application', etc.


       display=<string>
               Specify the real display where X connections have to be
               forwarded by the proxy running on the client.


       listen=<int>
               Local port used for accepting the proxy connection.


       loopback=<bool>
               Bind to the loopback device only.


       accept=<string>
               Name or IP of host that can connect to the proxy.


       connect=<string>
               Name or IP of host that the proxy will connect to.


       port=<int>
               Remote port used for the connection.


       retry=<int>
               Number of connection atempts.


       root=<string>
               The root directory for the session. Usually is the C-* or S-*
               in the .nx directory in the user's home, with '*' being the
               virtual display.


       session=<string>
               Name of the session file. The default is the name 'session' in
               the session directory.


       errors=<string>
               Name of the log file used by the proxy. The default is the name
               'errors' in the session directory.


       stats=<string>
               Name of the file where are written the proxy statistics. The
               default is a file 'stats' in the session directory. The proxy
               replaces the data in the file whenever it receives a SIGUSR1 or
               SIGUSR2 signal:

               SIGUSR1: Gives total statistics, i.e. statistics collected
               since the beginning of the session.

               SIGUSR2: Gives partial statistics, i.e. statistics collected
               since the last time this signal was received.


       cookie=<string>
               Use the provided cookie for authenticating to the remote proxy.
               The same cookie is used as the fake value used for the X
               authorization. The fake cookie is replaced on the X server side
               with the real cookie to be used for the display, so that the
               real cookie doesn't have to travel over the net. When not using
               a proxy cookie, any host will be able to connect to the proxy.
               See also the 'accept' parameter.


       nodelay=<bool>
               A boolean indicating if TCP_NODELAY has to be set on the proxy
               link. Old Linux kernels had problems with handling TCP_NODELAY
               on PPP links.


       policy=<bool>
               Let or not the agent decide when it is the best time to flush
               the proxy link. If set to 0, the proxy will flush any encoded
               data immediately. The option has only effect on the X client
               side proxy.


       render=<bool>
               Enable or disable use of the RENDER extension.


       taint=<bool>
               Try to suppress trivial sources of X roundtrips by generating
               the reply on the X client side.


       delta=<bool>
               Enable X differential compression.


       data=<int>
               Enable or disable the ZLIB data compression. It is possible to
               specify a value between 0 and 9. Usually the value is chosen
               automatically based on the requested link setting.


       stream=<int>
               Enable or disable the ZLIB stream compression. The value,
               between 0 and 9, is usually determined according to the
               requested link setting. Not fully implemented in nx-X11 Agent,
               yet.


       limit=<int>
               Specify a bitrate limit allowed for this session.


       memory=<int>
               Trigger memory optimizations used to keep small the size of X
               buffers.  This is useful on embedded plat- forms, or where
               memory is scarce.


       cache=<int>
               Size of the in-memory X message cache. Setting the value to 0
               will disable the memory cache as well as the NX differential
               compression.


       images=<int>
               Size of the persistent image cache.


       shseg=<int>
               Enable the use of the MIT-SHM extension between the nxproxy and
               the real X server. A value greater than 1 is assumed to be the
               size of requested shared memory segment. By default, the size
               of the segment is determined based on the size of the in-memory
               cache.


       load=<bool>
               Enable loading a persistent X message cache at the proxy
               startup.


       save=<bool>
               Enable saving a persistent X message cache at the end of
               session.


       cups=<int>
               Enable or disable forwarding of CUPS connections, by listening
               on the optional port 'n'.


       aux=<int>
               Enable or disable forwarding of the auxiliary X channel used
               for controlling the keyboard. The 'keybd=<int>' form is
               accepted for backward compatibility.


       smb=<int>
               Enable or disable forwarding of SMB connections. The
               'samba=<int>' form is accepted for backward compatibility.


       media=<int>
               Enable forwarding of audio connections.


       http=<int>
               Enable forwarding of HTTP connections.


       font=<int>
               Enable forwarding of reversed connections to a font server
               running on the NX server.


       file=<int>
               Enable forwarding of file transfer connections.


       mask=<int>
               Determine the distribution of channel ids between the proxies.
               By default, channels whose ids are multiple of 8 (starting from
               0) are reserved for the NX client side. All the other channels
               can be allocated by the nx-X11 Agent side.


       timeout=t
               Specify the keep-alive timeout used by proxies to determine if
               there is a network problem preventing communication with the
               remote peer. A value of 0 disables the check.


       cleanup=t
               Specify the number of seconds the proxy has to wait at session
               shutdown before closing all channels. The feature is used by
               the NX server to ensure that services are disconnected before
               shutting down the link.


       pack=<string>
               Determine the method used to compress images.


       product=<string>
               The product id of the client or server. The value is ignored by
               the proxy, but the client or server can provide it to
               facilitate the support.


       core=<bool>
               Enable production of core dumps when aborting the proxy
               connection.


       options=<string>
               Specify an additional file containing options that has to be
               merged with option read from the command line or the
               environment.


       kill=<int>
               Add the given process to the list of daemons that must be
               terminated at session shutdown. Multiple 'kill=<int>' options
               can be specified. The proxy will send them a SIGTERM signal
               just before exiting.


       strict=<bool>
               Optimize for responsiveness, rather than for the best use of
               all the available bandwidth.


       encryption=<bool>
               Should be set to 1 if the proxy is running as part of a program
               providing encryption of the point to point communication.


       These options are interpreted by the nx-NX Agent. They are ignored by
       the proxy.

                   rootless=<bool>
                   geometry=<string>
                   resize=<bool>
                   fullscreen=<bool>
                   keyboard=<string>
                   clipboard=<int>
                   streaming=<int>
                   backingstore=<int>

NX ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The nxproxy application (and also nxagent when using nxcomp support)
       can be influenced by the following environment variables:



       NX_ROOT The root NX directory is the place where the session directory
               and the cache files are created. This is usually overridden by
               passing the 'root=' option. By default, the root NX directory
               is assumed to be the directory '.nx' in the user's home.


       NX_SYSTEM
               The directory where NX programs and libraries reside. If not
               set, the value is assumed to be '/usr/NX'. Programs, libraries
               and data files are respectedly searched in the 'bin', 'lib' and
               'share' subdirectories.


       NX_HOME The NX user's home directory. If NX_ROOT is not set or invalid,
               the user's NX directory is created here.


       NX_TEMP The directory where all temporary files are to be created.


       NX_CLIENT
               The full path to the <nxclient> executable. If the variable is
               not set, the <nxclient> executable will be run assuming that
               the program is in the system path. This can be useful on
               platforms like Windows and the MacOS X where <nxclient> is
               located in a different directory compared to the other
               programs, to make easier for the user to execute the program
               from the shell.


       NX_SLAVE_CMD
               The full path to the slave channel handler. When the slave
               channel is enabled, the agent will listen on a port and forward
               the connection to the NX_SLAVE_CMD program. This can be used to
               implement agent/proxy communication for applications such as
               serial port and USB forwarding.


SHELL ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       HOME    The variable is checked in the case NX_HOME is not set, null or
               invalid.


       TEMP    The variable is checked whenever the NX_TEMP directory is not
               set, null or invalid.


       PATH    The path where all executables are searched, except <nxclient>.
               If NX_CLIENT is not set, also the client executable is searched
               in the system path.


       LD_LIBRARY_PATH
               System-wide library search order. This should be set by the
               program invoking the proxy.


       DISPLAY On the X server side, the DISPLAY variable indicates the
               location of the X11 server. When nxcomp is used as a transport
               library, the DISPLAY may represent a NX transport specification
               and options can passed in the form nx/nx,option=value...


       XAUTHORITY
               This is the file containing the X11 authorization cookie. If
               not set, the file is assumed to be in the user's home (either
               NX_HOME or HOME).


AUTHOR
       The nxproxy application has originally been derived from a software
       project called DXCP. The company NoMachine turned DXCP into nxcomp with
       nxproxy as executable around nxcomp.

       The current maintenance of nxproxy (major version 3) is coordinated
       between various projects, mainly by The Arctica Project, TheQVD (Qindel
       Group) and the X2Go Project.

       This manual has been written by Mike Gabriel
       <mike.gabriel@das-netzwerkteam.de> for the X2Go project
       (http://www.x2go.org) and later on improved for the Arctica Project
       (https://arctica-project.org).
