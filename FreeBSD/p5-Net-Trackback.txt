NAME
       Net::Trackback - an object-oriented interface for developing Trackback
       clients and servers,

DESCRIPTION
       This package is an object-oriented interface for developing Trackback
       clients and servers.

       I take no credit for the genius of TrackBack. Initially this module's
       code was derived from the standalone reference implementation release
       by Ben and Mena Trott. My motivation in developing this module is to
       make experimentation and implementation of TrackBack functions a bit
       easier.

       As of version 0.99, the interface has been overhauled and refined from
       the very crude original alpha release of 0.2x and is not backwards
       compatable in the least.

METHODS
       This module contains two exportable utility methods for working with
       XML.

       encode_xml($string)
           A simple utility for encoding XML's five named entities from text.

       decode_xml($string)
           A simple utility for encoding XML's five named entities into text.

   Deprecated
       Net::Trackback->is_data($object)
           Tests if the object is a Net::Trackback::Data object. Returns a
           boolean value.

       Net::Trackback->is_ping($object)
           Tests if the object is a Net::Trackback::Ping object. Returns a
           boolean value.

       Net::Trackback->is_message($object)
           Tests if the object is a Net::Trackback::Message object. Returns a
           boolean value.
