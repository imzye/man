NAME
       dumpmpeg - A program to dump frames from an MPEG movie.


SYNOPSIS
       dumpmpeg [options] file


DESCRIPTION
       dumpmpeg is a program that allows you to dump video frames from MPEG
       movie files. It uses the SDL MPEG Player Library to accomplish this and
       thus requires an open X-Window. Since it uses the SMPEG library, it can
       dump frames from format it supports, which currently is MPEG-1 video
       files.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Show short usage information

       --dump N
              Only dump every Nth frame. Default behavior is to dump every
              frame.

       --prefix N
              The file prefix of saved frames. The frame number and .bmp will
              be appended to this to form the file name. Default prefix is
              "framedump_".

       -s N, --start N
              Skip N frames before starting to dump.

       -q, --quiet
              Only print error messages during execution.

       -v, --version
              Print version information.
