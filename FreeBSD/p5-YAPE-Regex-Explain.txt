NAME
       YAPE::Regex::Explain - explanation of a regular expression

VERSION
       This document refers to YAPE::Regex::Explain version 4.01.

SYNOPSIS
         use YAPE::Regex::Explain;
         my $exp = YAPE::Regex::Explain->new($REx)->explain;

"YAPE" MODULES
       The "YAPE" hierarchy of modules is an attempt at a unified means of
       parsing and extracting content.  It attempts to maintain a generic
       interface, to promote simplicity and reusability.  The API is powerful,
       yet simple.  The modules do tokenization (which can be intercepted) and
       build trees, so that extraction of specific nodes is doable.

DESCRIPTION
       This module merely sub-classes "YAPE::Regex", and produces a rather
       verbose explanation of a regex, suitable for demonstration and tutorial
       purposes.

   Methods for "YAPE::Regex::Explain"
       •   "my $p = YAPE::Regex::Explain->new($regex);"

           Calls "YAPE::Regex"'s "new" method (see its docs).

       •   "my $p = YAPE::Regex::Explain->explain($mode);"

           Returns a string explaining the regex.  While not required for all
           regexes, it is sometimes necessary to compile the regex using the
           "qr//" operator before passing it to the "explain" method.  If
           $mode is "regex", it will output a valid regex (instead of the
           normal string).  If $mode is "silent", no comments will be added,
           but the regex will be expanded into a readable format.

EXAMPLES
       Print the full explanation for the regex "\Q[abc]\E\d+", compiling it
       first:

           print YAPE::Regex::Explain->new(qr/\Q[abc]\E\d+/)->explain();

       Print the explanation for the regex "\w[a-f]*", without comments:

           print YAPE::Regex::Explain->new('\w[a-f]*')->explain('silent');

       Print the explanation for a multi-line regex:

           my $re = qr{
                   (foo|bar)   # just a comment
                   \d+
                   /
           }ix;
           print YAPE::Regex::Explain->new($re)->explain();

LIMITATIONS
       There is no support for regular expression syntax added after Perl
       version 5.6, particularly any constructs added in 5.10.  For examples,
       refer to:
