     setfmac – set MAC label for a file system object

SYNOPSIS
     setfmac [-hqR] label file ...

DESCRIPTION
     The setfmac utility assigns the specified MAC label to the specified
     files.  The following options are available:

     -R      Set the labels on the file hierarchies rooted in the files
             instead of just the files themselves.

     -h      If the file is a symbolic link, change the label of the link
             rather than the file that the link points to.

     -q      Do not print non-fatal warnings during execution.
