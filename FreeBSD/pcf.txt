PCF(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 PCF(4)

NAME
     pcf – Philips I2C bus controller

SYNOPSIS
     device pcf

     In /boot/device.hints:
     hint.pcf.0.at="isa"
     hint.pcf.0.port="0x320"
     hint.pcf.0.irq="5"

     For one or more iicbus busses:
     device iicbus

DESCRIPTION
     The pcf driver provides support to the Philips PCF8584 I2C controller for
     the iicbus(4) system.

     The PCF8584 is an integrated circuit designed in CMOS technology which
     serves as an interface between most standard parallel-bus
     microcontrollers/microprocessors and the serial I2C-bus.  The PCF8584
     provides both master and slave functions.  Communication with I2C-bus is
     carried out on a byte-wise basis using interrupt or polled handshake.  It
     controls all the I2C-bus specific sequences, protocol, arbitration and
     timing.  The PCF8584 allows parallel-bus systems to communicate
     bidirectionally with the I2C-bus.
