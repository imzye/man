NAME
       Devel::Ditto - Identify where print output comes from

VERSION
       This document describes Devel::Ditto version 0.06

SYNOPSIS
         $ perl -MDevel::Ditto myprog.pl
         [main, t/myprog.pl, 9] This is regular text
         [main, t/myprog.pl, 10] This is a warning
         [MyPrinter, t/lib/MyPrinter.pm, 7] Hello, World
         [MyPrinter, t/lib/MyPrinter.pm, 8] Whappen?

DESCRIPTION
       Sometimes it's hard to work out where some printed output is coming
       from. This module ties STDOUT and STDERR such that each call to "print"
       or "warn" will have its output prefixed with the package, file and line
       of the "print" or "warn" statement.

       Load it in your program:

         use Devel::Ditto;

       or from the command line:

         perl -MDevel::Ditto myprog.pl

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       No bugs have been reported.

       "bug-devel-Ditto@rt.cpan.org", or through the web interface at
