       The Japanese morphological dictionary included in this system
       originates from ICOT Free Software.  The following conditions for ICOT
       Free Software applies to the morphological dictionary of the system.

       Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its
       original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED that
       the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will ALWAYS appear on, or
       be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially in the
       same form as set out herein and that such intended distribution, if
       actually made, will neither violate or otherwise contravene any of the
       laws and regulations of the countries having jurisdiction over the User
       or the intended distribution itself.

       NO WARRANTY

       The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the
       research and development conducted during the project and is provided
       to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the
       program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,
       implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term "warranty" used herein
       includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,
       performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of
       the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of
       any right of any third party.

       Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to
       have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for
       the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or otherwise
       connected with the program is assumed by the user.

       Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other
       organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the
       development of the program and their respective officials, directors,
       officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all
       damages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental
       and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection
       with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material
       or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,
       regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had
       knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the
       project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the
       foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term
       "use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,
       modification, copying and distribution of the program and the
       production of secondary products from the program.

       In the case where the program, whether in its original form or
       modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from
       any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or
       grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in
       writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted
       from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted
       above as far as the program is concerned.
