CP2112(4)              FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual              CP2112(4)

NAME
     cp2112 – driver for a USB GPIO and I2C peripheral device

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device cp2112
           device usb
           device gpio
           device iicbus

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           cp2112_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The cp2112 driver provides support for Silicon Labs CP2112 device.  The
     device has 8 general purpose I/O pins and an I2C controller that supports
     a subset of the I2C protocol.

     All pins support both input and output modes.  An output pin can be
     configured either for open-drain or push-pull operation.  Pins 0, 1 and 7
     support special functions: I2C transmit indication, I2C receive
     indication and clock output respectively.  At the moment the cp2112
     driver does not provide a way to enable and configure the special
     functions.

     The I2C controller supports read transactions with up to 512 bytes of
     data, write transactions with up to 61 bytes of data and a write followed
     by the repeated start followed by a read transactions where the write can
     be up to 16 bytes and the read can be up to 512 bytes.  Zero length
     transfers are not supported.  The cp2112 driver creates a gpio(4) and
     iicbus(4) child buses to expose the respective functions.
