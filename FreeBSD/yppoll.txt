NAME
     yppoll – ask version of NIS map from NIS server

SYNOPSIS
     yppoll [-d domain] [-h host] mapname

DESCRIPTION
     yppoll asks a NIS server process for the order number and which host is
     the master server for mapname.

     The options are as follows:

     -d domain
             Use the NIS domain domain instead of the default domain as
             returned by domainname(1).

     -h host
             Ask the NIS server process running on host for information about
             mapname.  If host is not specified, the server polled is the
             default server returned by ypwhich(1).
