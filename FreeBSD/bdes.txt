NAME
     bdes – encrypt/decrypt using the Data Encryption Standard (DES)

SYNOPSIS
     bdes [-abdp] [-F N] [-f N] [-k key] [-m N] [-o N] [-v vector]

DESCRIPTION
     The bdes utility implements all DES modes of operation described in FIPS
     PUB 81, including alternative cipher feedback mode and both
     authentication modes.  The bdes utility reads from the standard input and
     writes to the standard output.  By default, the input is encrypted using
     cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.  Using the same key for encryption and
     decryption preserves plain text.

     All modes but the electronic code book (ECB) mode require an
     initialization vector; if none is supplied, the zero vector is used.  If
     no key is specified on the command line, the user is prompted for one
     (see getpass(3) for more details).

     The options are as follows:

     -a      The key and initialization vector strings are to be taken as
             ASCII, suppressing the special interpretation given to leading
             “0X”, “0x”, “0B”, and “0b” characters.  This flag applies to both
             the key and initialization vector.

     -b      Use ECB mode.

     -d      Decrypt the input.

     -F N    Use N-bit alternative CFB mode.  Currently N must be a multiple
             of 7 between 7 and 56 inclusive (this does not conform to the
             alternative CFB mode specification).

     -f N    Use N-bit CFB mode.  Currently N must be a multiple of 8 between
             8 and 64 inclusive (this does not conform to the standard CFB
             mode specification).

     -k key  Use key as the cryptographic key.

     -m N    Compute a message authentication code (MAC) of N bits on the
             input.  The value of N must be between 1 and 64 inclusive; if N
             is not a multiple of 8, enough 0 bits will be added to pad the
             MAC length to the nearest multiple of 8.  Only the MAC is output.
             MACs are only available in CBC mode or in CFB mode.

     -o N    Use N-bit ouput feedback (OFB) mode.  Currently N must be a
             multiple of 8 between 8 and 64 inclusive (this does not conform
             to the OFB mode specification).

     -p      Disable the resetting of the parity bit.  This flag forces the
             parity bit of the key to be used as typed, rather than making
             each character be of odd parity.  It is used only if the key is
             given in ASCII.

     -v vector
             Set the initialization vector to vector; the vector is
             interpreted in the same way as the key.  The vector is ignored in
             ECB mode.

     The key and initialization vector are taken as sequences of ASCII
     characters which are then mapped into their bit representations.  If
     either begins with “0X” or “0x”, that one is taken as a sequence of
     hexadecimal digits indicating the bit pattern; if either begins with “0B”
     or “0b”, that one is taken as a sequence of binary digits indicating the
     bit pattern.  In either case, only the leading 64 bits of the key or
     initialization vector are used, and if fewer than 64 bits are provided,
     enough 0 bits are appended to pad the key to 64 bits.

     According to the DES standard, the low-order bit of each character in the
     key string is deleted.  Since most ASCII representations set the high-
     order bit to 0, simply deleting the low-order bit effectively reduces the
     size of the key space from 2^56 to 2^48 keys.  To prevent this, the high-
     order bit must be a function depending in part upon the low-order bit;
     so, the high-order bit is set to whatever value gives odd parity.  This
     preserves the key space size.  Note this resetting of the parity bit is
     not done if the key is given in binary or hex, and can be disabled for
     ASCII keys as well.

     The DES is considered a very strong cryptosystem, and other than table
     lookup attacks, key search attacks, and Hellman's time-memory tradeoff
     (all of which are very expensive and time-consuming), no cryptanalytic
     methods for breaking the DES are known in the open literature.  No doubt
     the choice of keys and key security are the most vulnerable aspect of
     bdes.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
     For implementors wishing to write software compatible with this program,
     the following notes are provided.  This software is believed to be
     compatible with the implementation of the data encryption standard
     distributed by Sun Microsystems, Inc.

     In the ECB and CBC modes, plaintext is encrypted in units of 64 bits (8
     bytes, also called a block).  To ensure that the plaintext file is
     encrypted correctly, bdes will (internally) append from 1 to 8 bytes, the
     last byte containing an integer stating how many bytes of that final
     block are from the plaintext file, and encrypt the resulting block.
     Hence, when decrypting, the last block may contain from 0 to 7 characters
     present in the plaintext file, and the last byte tells how many.  Note
     that if during decryption the last byte of the file does not contain an
     integer between 0 and 7, either the file has been corrupted or an
     incorrect key has been given.  A similar mechanism is used for the OFB
     and CFB modes, except that those simply require the length of the input
     to be a multiple of the mode size, and the final byte contains an integer
     between 0 and one less than the number of bytes being used as the mode.
     (This was another reason that the mode size must be a multiple of 8 for
     those modes.)

     Unlike Sun's implementation, unused bytes of that last block are not
     filled with random data, but instead contain what was in those byte
     positions in the preceding block.  This is quicker and more portable, and
     does not weaken the encryption significantly.

     If the key is entered in ASCII, the parity bits of the key characters are
     set so that each key character is of odd parity.  Unlike Sun's
     implementation, it is possible to enter binary or hexadecimal keys on the
     command line, and if this is done, the parity bits are not reset.  This
     allows testing using arbitrary bit patterns as keys.

     The Sun implementation always uses an initialization vector of 0 (that
     is, all zeroes).  By default, bdes does too, but this may be changed from
     the command line.

BUGS
     There is a controversy raging over whether the DES will still be secure
     in a few years.  The advent of special-purpose hardware could reduce the
     cost of any of the methods of attack named above so that they are no
     longer computationally infeasible.

     As the key or key schedule is stored in memory, the encryption can be
     compromised if memory is readable.  Additionally, programs which display
     programs' arguments may compromise the key and initialization vector, if
     they are specified on the command line.  To avoid this bdes overwrites
     its arguments, however, the obvious race cannot currently be avoided.

     Certain specific keys should be avoided because they introduce potential
     weaknesses; these keys, called the weak and semiweak keys, are (in hex
     notation, where p is either 0 or 1, and P is either ‘e’ or ‘f’):

           0x0p0p0p0p0p0p0p0p    0x0p1P0p1P0p0P0p0P
           0x0pep0pep0pfp0pfp    0x0pfP0pfP0pfP0pfP
           0x1P0p1P0p0P0p0P0p    0x1P1P1P1P0P0P0P0P
           0x1Pep1Pep0Pfp0Pfp    0x1PfP1PfP0PfP0PfP
           0xep0pep0pfp0pfp0p    0xep1Pep1pfp0Pfp0P
           0xepepepepepepepep    0xepfPepfPfpfPfpfP
