NAME
       Algorithm::Line::Bresenham - simple pixellated line-drawing algorithm

SYNOPSIS
        use Algorithm::Line::Bresenham qw/line/;
        my @points = line(3,3 => 5,0);
           # returns the list: [3,3], [4,2], [4,1], [5,0]
        line(3,3 => 5,0,  \&draw_line);
           # calls draw_line on each point in turn

DESCRIPTION
       Bresenham is one of the canonical line drawing algorithms for
       pixellated grids.  Given a start and an end-point, Bresenham calculates
       which points on the grid need to be filled to generate the line between
       them.

       Googling for 'Bresenham', and 'line drawing algorithms' gives some good
       overview.  The code here takes its starting point from Mark Feldman's
       Pascal code in his article Bresenham's Line and Circle Algorithms at
       <http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article767.asp>.

FUNCTIONS
   "line"
        line ($from_y, $from_x => $to_y, $to_x);

       Generates a list of all the intermediate points.  This is returned as a
       list of array references.

        line ($from_y, $from_x => $to_y, $to_x,  \&callback);

       Calls the referenced function on each point in turn.  The callback
       could be used to actually draw the point.  Returns the collated return
       values from the callback.

   "circle"
           my @points = circle ($y, $x, $radius)

       Returns the points to draw a circle with

TODO and BUGS
       None currently.

THANKS
       Patches for the circle algorithm and a float value bug contributed by
       Richard Clamp, thanks!
