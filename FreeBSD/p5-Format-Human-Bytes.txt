Format::Human::Bytes(3)                    User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Format::Human::Bytes - Format a bytecount and make it human readable

VERSION
       Version 0.06

SYNOPSIS
       Ever showed 12345678 bytes to the user instead of just saying 11MB?
       This module returns you a printable string which is more readable by
       humans than a simple bytecount.

           use Format::Human::Bytes;

           $readable = Format::Human::Bytes::base2($bytecount[,$decimals]);
           $readable = Format::Human::Bytes::base10($bytecount[,$decimals]);

           $readable = Format::Human::Bytes->base2($bytecount[,$decimals]);
           $readable = Format::Human::Bytes->base10($bytecount[,$decimals]);

           my $fhb = Format::Human::Bytes->new();
           $readable = $fhb->base2($bytecount[,$decimals]);
           $readable = $fhb->base10($bytecount[,$decimals]);

       All functions do "intelligent" switching to the next unit, for example:

           1000 => 1000B
           [...]
           8000 => 8000B
           9000 => 9kB

       The difference between 1000 bytes and 1500 bytes is usually bigger (for
       example because of a slow link) than between 95kB and 95,5kB. The same
       applies to 8000kB vs. 9 MB and for the other units.

       Depending on your usage, you may want to specify how many decimals
       should be shown (defaults to no decimals).

FUNCTIONS / METHODS
   new
           my $fhb = Format::Human::Bytes->new();

       Creates and returns a Format::Human::Bytes - object.

   base2
       Callable as a function:

           $readable = Format::Human::Bytes::base2($bytecount[,$decimals]);

       Callable as a class method:

           $readable = Format::Human::Bytes->base2($bytecount[,$decimals]);

       Callable as a object method:

           $readable = $fhb->base2($bytecount[,$decimals]);

       Returns the correct readable form of the given bytecount.

       Correct in this case means that 1kB are 1024 Bytes which is how
       computers see the world.

       If you specify a decimal parameter, the result number will have the
       number of decimal numbers you specified.

   base10
       Callable as a function:

           $readable = Format::Human::Bytes::base10($bytecount[,$decimals]);

       Callable as a class method:

           $readable = Format::Human::Bytes->base10($bytecount[,$decimals]);

       Callable as a object method:

           $readable = $fhb->base10($bytecount[,$decimals]);

       Returns the incorrect readable form of the given bytecount.

       Incorrect in this case means that 1kB is 1000 Bytes and 1 MB is 1000000
       bytes which is how some (many) people see the world, but it's wrong for
       computers.

       If you specify a decimal parameter, the result number will have the
       number of decimal numbers you specified.
