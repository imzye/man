LIBUFS(3)              FreeBSD Library Functions Manual              LIBUFS(3)

NAME
     libufs – operate on UFS file systems from userland

LIBRARY
     UFS File System Access Library (libufs, -lufs)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <sys/mount.h>
     #include <ufs/ufs/ufsmount.h>
     #include <ufs/ufs/dinode.h>
     #include <ufs/ffs/fs.h>
     #include <libufs.h>

DESCRIPTION
     The libufs library and the functions it provides are used for
     implementing utilities which need to access a UFS file system at a low
     level from userland.  Facilities provided are used to implement utilities
     such as newfs(8) and dumpfs(8).  The libufs library is designed to be
     simple, and to provide functions that are traditionally useful to have.

     A disk is represented as the type struct uufsd as defined in <libufs.h>.
     The structure is filled out, operations are performed, and the disk is
     closed.

ERRORS
     Functions provided by libufs return -1 in every functional error
     situation.  They also set the d_error field of struct uufsd to a string
     describing the error.
