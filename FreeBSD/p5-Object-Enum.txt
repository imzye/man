NAME
       Object::Enum - replacement for "if ($foo eq 'bar')"

SYNOPSIS
         use Object::Enum qw(Enum);

         my $color = Enum([ qw(red yellow green) ]);
         # ... later
         if ($color->is_red) {
         # it can't be yellow or green

EXPORTS
       See Sub::Exporter for ways to customize this module's exports.

   Enum
       An optional shortcut for "Object::Enum->new".

CLASS METHODS
   new
         my $obj = Object::Enum->new(\@values);
         # or
         $obj = Object::Enum->new(\%arg);

       Return a new Object::Enum, with one or more sets of possible values.

       The simplest case is to pass an arrayref, which returns an object
       capable of having any one of the given values or of being unset.

       The more complex cases involve passing a hashref, which may have the
       following keys:

       •   unset

           whether this object can be 'unset' (defaults to true)

       •   default

           this object's default value is (defaults to undef)

       •   values

           an arrayref, listing the object's possible values (at least one
           required)

OBJECT METHODS
   spawn
   clone
         my $new = $obj->clone;

         my $new = $obj->clone($value);

       Create a new Enum from an existing object, using the same arguments as
       were originally passed to "new" when that object was created.

       An optional value may be passed in; this is identical to (but more
       convenient than) calling "value" with the same argument on the newly
       cloned object.

       This method was formerly named "spawn".  That name will still work but
       is deprecated.

   value
       The current value as a string (or undef)

       Note: don't pass in undef; use the unset method instead.

   values
       The possible values for this object

   unset
       Unset the object's value (set to undef)

   is_*
   set_*
       Automatically generated from the values passed into "new".

       None of these methods take any arguments.

       The "set_*" methods are chainable; that is, they return the object on
       which they were called.  This lets you do useful things like:

         use Object::Enum Enum => { -as => 'color', values => [qw(red blue)] };

         print color->set_red->value; # prints 'red'
