GTIMER(1)                           GTimer                           GTIMER(1)



NAME
       gtimer - an application for recording time spent on user-defined tasks.


SYNOPSIS
       gtimer [-midnight offset] [-weekstart day] [-nosplash] [-resume]
       [-start task]


DESCRIPTION
       GTimer allows the user to time one or more activities.  Users define
       tasks that can be timed.  Text annotations can also be added to tasks.
       Reports can be generated that summarize time spent and annotations.


OPTIONS
       -midnight offset
               Specify the offset of midnight to use.  Users can allow time
               spent after midnight to be recorded for the previous day.  For
               example, the command

               gtimer -midnight 400

               will not consider everything 3:59AM the previous day.


       -weekstart day
               Specify which day of the week should be considered the
               beginning of the week when generating reports.  day should be a
               number between 0 and 6, where 0 is Sunday.  For example, the
               command

               gtimer -weekstart 1

               will use Monday as the first day of the week for all weekly
               reports.  The default is 0 (Sunday).


       -resume Start timing any tasks that were still be timed when GTimer
               last exited.


       -start taskname
               Start timing the specified task immediately.  This option can
               be used more than once on the command line.  For example, you
               can start a tasks with:

               gtimer -start 'GTimer development'


       -nosplash
               Do not display the splash window on startup.
