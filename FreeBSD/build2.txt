NAME
       b - build system driver

SYNOPSIS
       b --help
       b --version
       b [options] [variables] [buildspec]

       buildspec = meta-operation(operation(target...[,parameters])...)...

DESCRIPTION
       The build2 build system driver executes a set of meta-operations on
       operations on targets according to the build specification, or
       buildspec for short.  This process can be controlled by specifying
       driver options and build system variables.

       Note that options, variables, and buildspec fragments can be specified
       in any order. To avoid treating an argument that starts with '-' as an
       option, add the '--' separator. To avoid treating an argument that
       contains '=' as a variable, add the second '--' separator.

       All components in the buildspec can be omitted. If meta-operation is
       omitted, then it defaults to perform. If operation is omitted, then it
       defaults to the default operation for this meta-operation. For perform
       it is update. Finally, if target is omitted, then it defaults to the
       current working directory. A meta-operation on operation is called an
       action. Some operations and meta-operations may take additional
       parameters. For example:

       $ b                       # perform(update(./))
       $ b foo/                  # perform(update(foo/))
       $ b foo/ bar/             # perform(update(foo/ bar/))
       $ b update                # perform(update(./))
       $ b 'clean(../)'          # perform(clean(../))
       $ b perform               # perform(update(./))
       $ b configure             # configure(?(./))
       $ b 'configure(../)'      # configure(?(../))
       $ b clean update          # perform(clean(./) update(./))
       $ b configure update      # configure(?(./)) perform(update(./))
       $ b 'create(conf/, cxx)'  # create(?(conf/), cxx)

       Notice the question mark used to show the (imaginary) default operation
       for the configure meta-operation. For configure the default operation
       is "all operations". That is, it will configure all the operations for
       the specified target.

       You can also "generate" multiple operations for the same set of
       targets.  Compare:

       $ b 'clean(foo/ bar/)' 'update(foo/ bar/)'
       $ b '{clean update}(foo/ bar/)'

       Some more useful buildspec examples:

       $ b '{clean update}(...)'        # rebuild
       $ b '{clean update clean}(...)'  # make sure builds
       $ b '{clean test clean}(...)'    # make sure passes tests
       $ b '{clean disfigure}(...)'     # similar to distclean

       In POSIX shells parenthesis are special characters and must be quoted
       when used in a buildspec. Besides being an inconvenience in itself,
       quoting also inhibits path auto-completion. To help with this situation
       a shortcut syntax is available for executing a single operation or
       meta-operation, for example:

       $ b clean: foo/ bar/                # clean(foo/ bar/)
       $ b configure: src/@out/            # configure(src/@out/)
       $ b create: conf/, cxx              # create(conf/, cxx)
       $ b configure: config.cxx=g++ src/  # configure(src/) config.cxx=g++

       To activate the shortcut syntax the first buildspec argument must start
       with an operation or meta-operation name and end with a colon (:). To
       transform the shortcut syntax to the normal buildspec syntax the colon
       is replaced with the opening parenthesis ('('), the rest of the
       buildspec arguments are treated as is, and the final closing
       parenthesis (')') is added.

       For each target the driver expects to find buildfile either in the
       target's directory or, if the directory is part of the out tree
       (out_base), in the corresponding src directory (src_base).

       For example, assuming foo/ is the source directory of a project:

       $ b foo/              # out_base=src_base=foo/
       $ b foo-out/          # out_base=foo-out/ src_base=foo/
       $ b foo-out/exe{foo}  # out_base=foo-out/ src_base=foo/

       An exception to this requirement is a directory target in which case,
       provided the directory has subdirectories, an implied buildfile with
       the following content is assumed:

       # Implied directory buildfile: build all subdirectories.
       #
       ./: */

       In the above example, we assumed that the build system driver was able
       to determine the association between out_base and src_base. In case
       src_base and out_base are not the same directory, this is achieved in
       one of two ways: the config module (which implements the configure,
       disfigure, and create meta-operations) saves this association as part
       of the configuration process. If, however, the association hasn't been
       saved, then we have to specify src_base explicitly using the following
       extended target syntax:

       src-base/@target

       Continuing with the previous example:

       $ b foo/@foo-out/exe{foo}  # out_base=foo-out/ src_base=foo/

       Normally, you would need to specify src_base explicitly only once,
       during configuration. For example, a typical usage would be:

       $ b configure: foo/@foo-out/  # src_base is saved
       $ b foo-out/                  # no need to specify src_base
       $ b clean: foo-out/exe{foo}   # no need to specify src_base

       Besides in and out of source builds, build2 also supports configuring a
       project's source directory as forwarded to an out of source build. With
       such a forwarded configuration in place, if we run the build system
       driver from the source directory, it will automatically build in the
       output directory and backlink (using symlinks or another suitable
       mechanism) certain "interesting" targets (executables, documentation,
       etc) to the source directory for easy access. Continuing with the
       previous example:

       $ b configure: foo/@foo-out/,forward  # foo/ forwarded to foo-out/
       $ cd foo/
       $ b                                   # build in foo-out/
       $ ./foo                               # symlink to foo-out/foo

       The ability to specify build2 variables as part of the command line is
       normally used to pass configuration values, for example:

       $ b config.cxx=clang++ config.cxx.coptions=-O3

       Similar to buildspec, POSIX shells often inhibit path auto-completion
       on the right hand side of a variable assignment. To help with this
       situation the assignment can be broken down into three separate command
       line arguments, for example:

       $ b config.import.libhello = ../libhello/

       The build system has the following built-in and pre-defined meta-
       operations:

       perform
              Perform an operation.

       configure
              Configure all operations supported by a project and save the
              result in the project's build/config.build file. Implemented by
              the config module. For example:

              $ b configure                      \
                  config.cxx=clang++             \
                  config.cxx.coptions=-O3        \
                  config.install.root=/usr/local \
                  config.install.root.sudo=sudo

              Use the forward parameter to instead configure a source
              directory as forwarded to an out of source build. For example:

              $ b configure: src/@out/,forward

       disfigure
              Disfigure all operations supported by a project and remove the
              project's build/config.build file. Implemented by the config
              module.

              Use the forward parameter to instead disfigure forwarding of a
              source directory to an out of source build. For example:

              $ b disfigure: src/,forward

       create
              Create and configure a configuration project. Implemented by the
              config module.

              Normally a build2 project is created manually by writing the
              bootstrap.build and config.build files, adding source files, and
              so on. However, a special kind of project, which we call
              configuration, is often useful. Such a project doesn't have any
              source files of its own.  Instead, it serves as an amalgamation
              for building other projects as part of it. Doing it this way has
              two major benefits: sub-projects automatically resolve their
              imports to other projects in the amalgamation and sub-projects
              inherits their configuration from the amalgamation (which means
              if we want to change something, we only need to do it in one
              place).

              As an example, let's assume we have two C++ projects: the
              libhello library in libhello/ and the hello executable that
              imports it in hello/. And we want to build hello with clang++.

              One way to do it would be to configure and build each project in
              its own directory, for example:

              $ b configure: libhello/@libhello-clang/ config.cxx=clang++
              $ b configure: hello/@hello-clang/ config.cxx=clang++ \
                  config.import.libhello=libhello-clang/

              The two drawbacks, as mentioned above, are the need to
              explicitly resolve the import and having to make changes in
              multiple places should, for example, we want to switch from
              clang++ to g++.

              We can, however, achieve the same end result but without any of
              the drawbacks using the configuration project:

              $ b create: clang/,cxx config.cxx=clang++  # Creates clang/.
              $ b configure: libhello/@clang/libhello/
              $ b configure: hello/@clang/hello/

              The targets passed to the create meta-operation must be
              directories which should either not exist or be empty. For each
              such directory create first initializes a project as described
              below and then configures it by executing the configure meta-
              operation.

              The first optional parameter to create is the list of modules to
              load in root.build. By default, create appends .config to the
              names of these modules so that only their configurations are
              loaded. You can override this behavior by specifying the period
              (.)  after the module name. You can also instruct create to use
              the optional module load by prefixing the module name with the
              question mark (?).

              The second optional parameter is the list of modules to load in
              bootstrap.build. If not specified, then the test, dist, and
              install modules are loaded by default. The config module is
              always loaded first.

              Besides creating project's bootstrap.build and root.build,
              create also writes the root buildfile with the following
              contents:

              ./: {*/ -build/}

              If used, this buildfile will build all the sub-projects
              currently present in the configuration.

       dist
              Prepare a distribution containing all files necessary to perform
              all operations in a project. Implemented by the dist module.

       info
              Print basic information (name, version, source and output
              directories, etc) about one or more projects to stdout,
              separating multiple projects with a blank line. Each project is
              identified by its root directory target. For example (some
              output is omitted):

              $ b info: libfoo/ libbar/
              project: libfoo
              version: 1.0.0
              src_root: /tmp/libfoo
              out_root: /tmp/libfoo
              subprojects: @tests

              project: libbar
              version: 2.0.0
              src_root: /tmp/libbar
              out_root: /tmp/libbar-out
              subprojects: @tests

              To omit discovering and printing subprojects information, use
              the no_subprojects parameter, for example:

              $ b info: libfoo/,no_subprojects

              To instead print this information in the JSON format, use the
              json parameter, for example:

              $ b info: libfoo/,json

              In this case the output is a JSON array of objects which are the
              serialized representation of the following C++ struct
              project_info:

              struct subproject
              {
                string           path;
                optional<string> name;
              };

              struct project_info
              {
                optional<string>   project;
                optional<string>   version;
                optional<string>   summary;
                optional<string>   url;
                string             src_root;
                string             out_root;
                optional<string>   amalgamation;
                vector<subproject> subprojects;
                vector<string>     operations;
                vector<string>     meta_operations;
                vector<string>     modules;
              };

              For example:

              [
                {
                  "project": "libfoo",
                  "version": "1.0.0",
                  "summary": "libfoo C++ library",
                  "src_root": "/tmp/libfoo",
                  "out_root": "/tmp/gcc-debug/libfoo",
                  "amalgamation": "..",
                  "subprojects": [
                    {
                      "path": "tests"
                    }
                  ],
                  "operations": [
                    "update",
                    "clean",
                    "test",
                    "update-for-test",
                    "install",
                    "uninstall",
                    "update-for-install"
                  ],
                  "meta-operations": [
                    "perform",
                    "configure",
                    "disfigure",
                    "dist",
                    "info"
                  ],
                  "modules": [
                    "version",
                    "config",
                    "test",
                    "install",
                    "dist"
                  ]
                }
              ]

              See the JSON OUTPUT section below for details on the overall
              properties of this format and the semantics of the struct
              serialization.

       The build system has the following built-in and pre-defined operations:

       update
              Update a target.

       clean
              Clean a target.

       test
              Test a target. Performs update as a pre-operation. Implemented
              by the test module.

       update-for-test
              Update a target for testing. This operation is equivalent to the
              update pre-operation as executed by the test operation and can
              be used to only update what is necessary for testing.
              Implemented by the test module.

       install
              Install a target. Performs update as a pre-operation.
              Implemented by the install module.

       uninstall
              Uninstall a target. Performs update as a pre-operation.
              Implemented by the install module.

       update-for-install
              Update a target for installation. This operation is equivalent
              to the update pre-operation as executed by the install operation
              and can be used to only update what is necessary for
              installation. Implemented by the install module.

       Note that buildspec and command line variable values are treated as
       buildfile fragments and so can use quoting and escaping as well as
       contain variable expansions and evaluation contexts. However, to be
       more usable on various platforms, escaping in these two situations is
       limited to the effective sequences of \', \", \\, \$, and \( with all
       other sequences interpreted as is. Together with double-quoting this is
       sufficient to represent any value. For example:

       $ b config.install.root=c:\projects\install
       $ b "config.install.root='c:\Program Files\test\'"
       $ b 'config.cxx.poptions=-DFOO_STR="foo"'

OPTIONS
       -v     Print actual commands being executed. This options is equivalent
              to --verbose 2.

       -V     Print all underlying commands being executed. This options is
              equivalent to --verbose 3.

       --quiet|-q
              Run quietly, only printing error messages in most contexts. In
              certain contexts (for example, while updating build system
              modules) this verbosity level may be ignored. Use --silent to
              run quietly in all contexts.  This option is equivalent to
              --verbose 0.

       --silent
              Run quietly, only printing error messages in all contexts.

       --verbose level
              Set the diagnostics verbosity to level between 0 and 6. Level 0
              disables any non-error messages (but see the difference between
              --quiet and --silent) while level 6 produces lots of
              information, with level 1 being the default. The following
              additional types of diagnostics are produced at each level:

              1.  High-level information messages.

              2.  Essential underlying commands being executed.

              3.  All underlying commands being executed.

              4.  Information that could be helpful to the user.

              5.  Information that could be helpful to the developer.

              6.  Even more detailed information.

       --stat Display build statistics.

       --progress
              Display build progress. If printing to a terminal the progress
              is displayed by default for low verbosity levels. Use --no-
              progress to suppress.

       --no-progress
              Don't display build progress.

       --diag-color
              Use color in diagnostics. If printing to a terminal the color is
              used by default provided the terminal is not dumb. Use --no-
              diag-color to suppress.

              This option affects the diagnostics printed by the build system
              itself. Some rules may also choose to propagate its value to
              tools (such as compilers) that they invoke.

       --no-diag-color
              Don't use color in diagnostics.

       --jobs|-j num
              Number of active jobs to perform in parallel. This includes both
              the number of active threads inside the build system as well as
              the number of external commands (compilers, linkers, etc)
              started but not yet finished. If this option is not specified or
              specified with the 0 value, then the number of available
              hardware threads is used.

       --max-jobs|-J num
              Maximum number of jobs (threads) to create. The default is 8x
              the number of active jobs (--jobs|j) on 32-bit architectures and
              32x on 64-bit. See the build system scheduler implementation for
              details.

       --queue-depth|-Q num
              The queue depth as a multiplier over the number of active jobs.
              Normally we want a deeper queue if the jobs take long (for
              example, compilation) and shorter if they are quick (for
              example, simple tests). The default is 4. See the build system
              scheduler implementation for details.

       --file-cache impl
              File cache implementation to use for intermediate build results.
              Valid values are noop (no caching or compression) and sync-lz4
              (no caching with synchronous LZ4 on-disk compression). If this
              option is not specified, then a suitable default implementation
              is used (currently sync-lz4).

       --max-stack num
              The maximum stack size in KBytes to allow for newly created
              threads. For pthreads-based systems the driver queries the stack
              size of the main thread and uses the same size for creating
              additional threads. This allows adjusting the stack size using
              familiar mechanisms, such as ulimit.  Sometimes, however, the
              stack size of the main thread is excessively large.  As a
              result, the driver checks if it is greater than a predefined
              limit (64MB on 64-bit systems and 32MB on 32-bit ones) and caps
              it to a more sensible value (8MB) if that's the case. This
              option allows you to override this check with the special zero
              value indicating that the main thread stack size should be used
              as is.

       --serial-stop|-s
              Run serially and stop at the first error. This mode is useful to
              investigate build failures that are caused by build system
              errors rather than compilation errors. Note that if you don't
              want to keep going but still want parallel execution, add
              --jobs|-j (for example -j 0 for default concurrency). Note also
              that during serial execution there is no diagnostics buffering
              and child process' stderr is a terminal (unless redirected; see
              --no-diag-buffer for details).

       --dry-run|-n
              Print commands without actually executing them. Note that
              commands that are required to create an accurate build state
              will still be executed and the extracted auxiliary dependency
              information saved. In other words, this is not the "don't touch
              the filesystem" mode but rather "do minimum amount of work to
              show what needs to be done". Note also that only the perform
              meta-operation supports this mode.

       --no-diag-buffer
              Do not buffer diagnostics from child processes. By default,
              unless running serially, such diagnostics is buffered and
              printed all at once after each child exits in order to prevent
              interleaving. However, this can have side-effects since the
              child process' stderr is no longer a terminal.  Most notably,
              the use of color in diagnostics may be disabled by some
              programs. On the other hand, depending on the platform and
              programs invoked, the interleaving diagnostics may not break
              lines and thus could be tolerable.

       --match-only
              Match the rules without executing the operation. This mode is
              primarily useful for profiling and dumping the build system
              state.

       --load-only
              Match the rules only to alias{} targets ignoring other targets
              and without executing the operation. In particular, this has the
              effect of loading all the subdirectory buildfiles that are not
              explicitly included. Note that this option can only be used with
              the perform(update) action on an alias{} target, usually dir{}.

       --no-external-modules
              Don't load external modules during project bootstrap. Note that
              this option can only be used with meta-operations that do not
              load the project's buildfiles, such as info.

       --structured-result fmt
              Write the result of execution in a structured form. In this
              mode, instead of printing to stderr diagnostics messages about
              the outcome of executing actions on targets, the driver writes
              to stdout a machine-readable result description in the specified
              format. Valid values for this option are lines and json. Note
              that currently only the perform meta-operation supports the
              structured result output.

              If the output format is lines, then the result is written one
              line per the buildspec action/target pair. Each line has the
              following form:

              state meta-operation operation target

              Where state can be one of unchanged, changed, or failed. If the
              action is a pre or post operation, then the outer operation is
              specified in parenthesis. For example:

              unchanged perform update(test) /tmp/hello/hello/exe{hello}
              changed perform test /tmp/hello/hello/exe{hello}

              If the output format is json, then the output is a JSON array of
              objects which are the serialized representation of the following
              C++ struct target_action_result:

              struct target_action_result
              {
                string           target;
                string           display_target;
                string           target_type;
                optional<string> target_path;
                string           meta_operation;
                string           operation;
                optional<string> outer_operation;
                string           state;
              };

              For example:

              [
                {
                  "target": "/tmp/hello/hello/exe{hello.}",
                  "display_target": "/tmp/hello/hello/exe{hello}",
                  "target_type": "exe",
                  "target_path": "/tmp/hello/hello/hello",
                  "meta_operation": "perform",
                  "operation": "update",
                  "outer_operation": "test",
                  "state": "unchanged"
                },
                {
                  "target": "/tmp/hello/hello/exe{hello.}",
                  "display_target": "/tmp/hello/hello/exe{hello}",
                  "target_type": "exe",
                  "target_path": "/tmp/hello/hello/hello",
                  "meta_operation": "perform",
                  "operation": "test",
                  "state": "changed"
                }
              ]

              See the JSON OUTPUT section below for details on the overall
              properties of this format and the semantics of the struct
              serialization.

              The target member is the target name that is qualified with the
              extension (if applicable) and, if required, is quoted so that it
              can be passed back to the build system driver on the command
              line. The display_target member is the unqualified and unquoted
              "display" target name, the same as in the lines format. The
              target_type member is the type of target.  The target_path
              member is an absolute path to the target if the target type is
              path-based or dir.

       --mtime-check
              Perform file modification time sanity checks. These checks can
              be helpful in diagnosing spurious rebuilds and are enabled by
              default on Windows (which is known not to guarantee
              monotonically increasing mtimes) and for the staged version of
              the build system on other platforms. Use --no-mtime-check to
              disable.

       --no-mtime-check
              Don't perform file modification time sanity checks. See --mtime-
              check for details.

       --dump phase
              Dump the build system state after the specified phase. Valid
              phase values are load (after loading buildfiles) and match
              (after matching rules to targets). The match value also has the
              match-pre and match-post variants to dump the state for the
              pre/post-operations (match dumps the main operation only).
              Repeat this option to dump the state after multiple
              phases/variants. By default the entire build state is dumped but
              this behavior can be altered with the --dump-scope and --dump-
              target options. See also the --match-only and --load-only
              options.

       --dump-format format
              Representation format and output stream to use when dumping the
              build system state. Valid values for this option are buildfile
              (a human-readable, Buildfile-like format written to stderr; this
              is the default), and json-v0.1 (machine-readable, JSON-based
              format written to stdout). For details on the buildfile format,
              see Diagnostics and Debugging (#intro-diag-debug). For details
              on the json-v0.1 format, see the JSON OUTPUT section below
              (overall properties) and JSON Dump Format (#json-dump) (format
              specifics). Note that the JSON format is currently unstable
              (thus the temporary -v0.1 suffix).

              Note that because it's possible to end up with multiple dumps
              (for example, by specifying the --dump-scope and/or --dump-
              target options multiple times), the JSON output is in the "JSON
              Lines" form, that is, without pretty-printing and with the top-
              level JSON objects delimited by newlines.  Note also that if the
              JSON dump output is combined with --structured-result=json, then
              the structured result is the last line.

       --dump-scope dir
              Dump the build system state for the specified scope only. Repeat
              this option to dump the state of multiple scopes.

       --dump-target target
              Dump the build system state for the specified target only.
              Repeat this option to dump the state of multiple targets.

       --trace-match target
              Trace rule matching for the specified target. This is primarily
              useful during troubleshooting. Repeat this option to trace
              multiple targets.

       --trace-execute target
              Trace rule execution for the specified target. This is primarily
              useful during troubleshooting. Repeat this option to trace
              multiple targets.

       --no-column
              Don't print column numbers in diagnostics.

       --no-line
              Don't print line and column numbers in diagnostics.

       --buildfile path
              The alternative file to read build information from. The default
              is buildfile or build2file, depending on the project's build
              file/directory naming scheme. If path is '-', then read from
              stdin. Note that this option only affects the files read as part
              of the buildspec processing. Specifically, it has no effect on
              the source and include directives. As a result, this option is
              primarily intended for testing rather than changing the build
              file names in real projects.

       --config-guess path
              The path to the config.guess(1) script that should be used to
              guess the host machine triplet. If this option is not specified,
              then b will fall back on to using the target it was built for as
              host.

       --config-sub path
              The path to the config.sub(1) script that should be used to
              canonicalize machine triplets. If this option is not specified,
              then b will use its built-in canonicalization support which
              should be sufficient for commonly-used platforms.

       --pager path
              The pager program to be used to show long text. Commonly used
              pager programs are less and more. You can also specify
              additional options that should be passed to the pager program
              with --pager-option. If an empty string is specified as the
              pager program, then no pager will be used. If the pager program
              is not explicitly specified, then b will try to use less. If it
              is not available, then no pager will be used.

       --pager-option opt
              Additional option to be passed to the pager program. See --pager
              for more information on the pager program. Repeat this option to
              specify multiple pager options.

       --options-file file
              Read additional options from file. Each option should appear on
              a separate line optionally followed by space or equal sign (=)
              and an option value. Empty lines and lines starting with # are
              ignored.  Option values can be enclosed in double (") or single
              (') quotes to preserve leading and trailing whitespaces as well
              as to specify empty values. If the value itself contains
              trailing or leading quotes, enclose it with an extra pair of
              quotes, for example '"x"'. Non-leading and non-trailing quotes
              are interpreted as being part of the option value.

              The semantics of providing options in a file is equivalent to
              providing the same set of options in the same order on the
              command line at the point where the --options-file option is
              specified except that the shell escaping and quoting is not
              required. Repeat this option to specify more than one options
              file.

       --default-options dir
              The directory to load additional default options files from.

       --no-default-options
              Don't load default options files.

       --help Print usage information and exit.

       --version
              Print version and exit.

DEFAULT OPTIONS FILES
       Instead of having a separate config file format for tool configuration,
       the build2 toolchain uses default options files which contain the same
       options as what can be specified on the command line. The default
       options files are like options files that one can specify with
       --options-file except that they are loaded by default.

       The default options files for the build system driver are called
       b.options and are searched for in the .build2/ subdirectory of the home
       directory and in the system directory (for example, /etc/build2/) if
       configured. Note that besides options these files can also contain
       global variable overrides.

       Once the search is complete, the files are loaded in the reverse order,
       that is, beginning from the system directory (if any), followed by the
       home directory, and finishing off with the options specified on the
       command line.  In other words, the files are loaded from the more
       generic to the more specific with the command line options having the
       ability to override any values specified in the default options files.

       If a default options file contains --no-default-options, then the
       search is stopped at the directory containing this file and no outer
       files are loaded. If this option is specified on the command line, then
       none of the default options files are searched for or loaded.

       An additional directory containing default options files can be
       specified with --default-options. Its configuration files are loaded
       after the home directory.

       The order in which default options files are loaded is traced at the
       verbosity level 3 (-V option) or higher.

JSON OUTPUT
       Commands that support the JSON output specify their formats as a
       serialized representation of a C++ struct or an array thereof. For
       example:

       struct package
       {
         string name;
       };

       struct configuration
       {
         uint64_t         id;
         string           path;
         optional<string> name;
         bool             default;
         vector<package>  packages;
       };

       An example of the serialized JSON representation of struct
       configuration:

       {
         "id": 1,
         "path": "/tmp/hello-gcc",
         "name": "gcc",
         "default": true,
         "packages": [
           {
             "name": "hello"
           }
         ]
       }

       This sections provides details on the overall properties of such
       formats and the semantics of the struct serialization.

       The order of members in a JSON object is fixed as specified in the
       corresponding struct. While new members may be added in the future (and
       should be ignored by older consumers), the semantics of the existing
       members (including whether the top-level entry is an object or array)
       may not change.

       An object member is required unless its type is optional<>, bool, or
       vector<> (array). For bool members absent means false.  For vector<>
       members absent means empty. An empty top-level array is always present.

       For example, the following JSON text is a possible serialization of the
       above struct configuration:

       {
         "id": 1,
         "path": "/tmp/hello-gcc"
       }

EXIT STATUS
       Non-zero exit status is returned in case of an error.

ENVIRONMENT
       The HOME environment variable is used to determine the user's home
       directory. If it is not set, then getpwuid(3) is used instead. This
       value is used to shorten paths printed in diagnostics by replacing the
       home directory with ~/. It is also made available to buildfile's as the
       build.home variable.

       The BUILD2_VAR_OVR environment variable is used to propagate global
       variable overrides to nested build system driver invocations. Its value
       is a list of global variable assignments separated with newlines.

       The BUILD2_DEF_OPT environment variable is used to suppress loading of
       default options files in nested build system driver invocations. Its
       values are false or 0 to suppress and true or 1 to load.
