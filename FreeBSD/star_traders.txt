NAME
       trader - a game of interstellar trading

SYNOPSIS
       trader [--no-color|--no-colour] [--max-turn=NUM] [GAME]
       trader [-h|--help] [-V|--version]

DESCRIPTION
       Star Traders is a simple game of interstellar trading, where the
       objective is to create companies, buy and sell shares, borrow and repay
       money, in order to become the wealthiest player (the winner).

OPTIONS
       GAME   If GAME is specified as a number between 1 and 9 (inclusive),
              load and continue playing that game.  If GAME is not specified,
              start a new game.

       --no-color, --no-colour
              Don't use colour for displaying the text in the game.  Use this
              option for a “retro-computing” look (as shown in the EXAMPLES
              below).

       --max-turn=NUM
              Set the number of turns in the game to NUM.  In this version of
              Star Traders, NUM must be greater or equal to 10.  If this
              option is not specified, the default is 50 turns.

       -h, --help
              Show a summary of command-line options and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information about the program, then exit.

EXIT STATUS
       0      Star Traders finished without any errors.

       1      Star Traders encountered an unrecoverable problem or error; a
              diagnostic message will be written to standard error in this
              case.

EXAMPLES
       You can start a new game by running Star Traders without any command
       line options:

              trader

       Once the game starts, you will be asked to enter the number of people
       playing.  From one to eight people can play (although, in this version,
       they will all have to share the one keyboard and screen!).  After
       entering the names of the players, you will have the opportunity to
       read instructions on how to play the game.  Do so—and good luck in the
       game!

       If you would like to continue a previously-saved game, simply specify
       that game number on the command line.  For example, the following
       starts game 4, if it was previously saved:

              trader 4

       If you are running under the X Window System, you might like to start
       the game in a dedicated xterm(1) window (typed all on one line):

              xterm -g 80x24 -fa Mono -fs 18 -bg black -fg white -bc +sb +fbx
              -e trader &

       If you would like a full “retro-computing” green-screen experience, try
       (again, typed all on one line):

              xterm -g 80x24 -fa Mono -fs 18 -bg '#181818' -fg '#2CAB00' -bc
              +sb +bdc +fbx -xrm 'XTerm*colorBD: #41FF00' -e trader
              --no-colour &

       Or, if you prefer the old amber screens of yesteryear:

              xterm -g 80x24 -fa Mono -fs 18 -bg '#101010' -fg '#AB7A00' -bc
              +sb +bdc +fbx -xrm 'XTerm*colorBD: #FFB700' -e trader
              --no-colour &


ENVIRONMENT
       XDG_DATA_HOME, HOME
              If XDG_DATA_HOME is set to an absolute pathname (that is, a path
              that starts with “/”), Star Traders will use that directory,
              with a subdirectory trader, to store game files.  If this
              environment variable is not set or does not start with “/”,
              ~/.local/share/trader will be used instead, where “~” represents
              your home directory, as contained in the HOME environment
              variable.

       LINES, COLUMNS
              Star Traders uses the Curses library for displaying text on the
              screen.  As such, it will access these two environment variables
              if the underlying Curses library does so (see, for example, the
              ENVIRONMENT section in the ncurses(3) manual page for in-depth
              details).  It requires a text console or window of at least
              80×24 in size.

       LANG, LC_ALL, etc.
              This version of Star Traders has full support for locales and
              will use appropriate settings.  In particular, messages will be
              displayed using LC_MESSAGES and LANGUAGE (if Star Traders has
              been translated into that language).  In addition, numeric
              quantities will be displayed using LC_NUMERIC and monetary
              quantities will use LC_MONETARY.  See the locale(7) or
              setlocale(3) manual pages for more details on locale settings.

       TEXTDOMAINDIR
              If set, Star Traders will use this path as the base with which
              to locate its message catalogs instead of the compiled-in path;
              the relevant trader.mo files should be located in language-code
              subdirectories (such as en_AU), in LC_MESSAGES sub-
              subdirectories.

FILES
       ~/.local/share/trader/gameN
              Star Traders stores saved game files in the .local/share/trader
              subdirectory in your home directory (unless overridden by the
              XDG_DATA_HOME environment variable).  N is a number between 1
              and 9 inclusive.  The game file is scrambled to prevent you or
              others from casually cheating!

       ~/.trader/gameN
              If the ~/.trader directory exists, game files will be read from
              and saved to this location instead.  This is for compatibility
              with versions of Star Traders prior to version 7.15.

HISTORY
       The original (and very primitive) game was written by Steven Faber and
       published as Star Lanes on pages 131–138 in Interface Age, June 1977.
       It was described by the magazine's software editor as:

              ... a new imaginative Monopoly-type microcomputer game that
              everyone can and will want to play if you have a microcomputer.
              Like the Monopoly game, STAR LANES combines financial and
              positional strategies as players attempt to lay claim to
              valuable pieces of space real estate between the stars in the
              Galaxy.
              — Robert A. Stevens, page 123, Interface Age, June 1977.

       S. J. Singer took Star Lanes and republished it in 1984 as Star
       Traders.  His version was modified by John Zaitseff for Microsoft Basic
       (MBASIC) running under the CP/M-80 operating system; it was released on
       7th March, 1988.

       Star Traders was then completely rewritten in 1990 for the Australian-
       designed 8-bit MicroBee computer running CP/M-80 on a Zilog Z80
       processor, using Turbo Pascal 3.01a.  Essentially, only the name of the
       game, the names of the first five companies and some of the key ideas
       were retained in this version.  Version 4.1 of Star Traders was
       released on 1st August, 1991.

       In 1992, it was recompiled for the NEC Advanced Personal Computer (with
       8-inch floppy drives!) running CP/M-86 on an 8086 processor, using
       Turbo Pascal 2.0.  This version had colour added to it in the form of
       ANSI escape sequences; version 4.4 was released on 2nd August, 1993.

       The next version came in 1993, when the program was recompiled to run
       on IBM-compatible machines running MS-DOS and ANSI.SYS.  Turbo Pascal
       6.0 was used for this.  The ANSI escape sequences were slightly
       different under MS-DOS than under the NEC, in that the NEC supported a
       number of extra character attributes.  In other words, the MS-DOS
       version looked worse than the one running under CP/M-86!

       Star Traders was recompiled again in 1994 for IBM-compatible machines
       with VGA/EGA/CGA video graphics adapters.  The output routines were
       recoded to use a “windowed” look.  Borland Pascal 7.0 was used for this
       purpose, along with a number of text window manipulation modules.
       Version 5.4 was released on 1st June, 1994.

       In 1995, Star Traders was completely rewritten for the 16-bit Microsoft
       Windows 3.1 graphical environment.  Microsoft Visual Basic 3.0 was used
       for this purpose.  Although completely rewritten, the original
       algorithms were reused from previous versions.  Version 6.0 of the game
       was released on 15th September, 1995.

       Star Traders was then to languish until almost 16 years later... when
       the game was rewritten once again, this time in the C programming
       language.  Version 7.0 was released on 25th July, 2011 for Unix-like
       operating systems such as Linux, with subsequent releases to add
       features and correct bugs.  Now you, too, can run this small piece of
       computing history!
