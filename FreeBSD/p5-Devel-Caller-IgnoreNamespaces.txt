Devel::Caller::IgnoreNamespaces(3)         User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Devel::Caller::IgnoreNamespaces - make available a magic caller() which
       can ignore namespaces that you tell it about

SYNOPSIS
           package Foo::Bar

           use Devel::Caller::IgnoreNamespaces;
           Devel::Caller::IgnoreNamespaces::register(__PACKAGE__);

DESCRIPTION
       If your module should be ignored by caller(), just like Hook::LexWrap
       is by its magic caller(), then call this module's register() subroutine
       with its name.

SUBROUTINES
   register('packagename', 'anotherpackage', ...)
       Takes a list of packages that caller() will ignore in future.

BUGS and FEEDBACK
       Please report any bugs using <http://rt.cpan.org>.  The best bug
       reports include a file with a test in it that fails with the current
       code and will pass once the bug is fixed.

       I welcome feedback, especially constructive criticism, by email.

       Feature requests are more likely to be accepted if accompanied by a
       patch and tests.
