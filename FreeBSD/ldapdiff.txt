NAME
       ldapdiff - Tool to synchronize ldap servers using ldif formatted input
       files

SYNOPSIS
       ldapdiff [options]

DESCRIPTION
       ldapdiff combines classical "diff" and "patch" functionality in one
       application. the difference is, that ldapdiff is not designed for use
       on flat ascii files, it is designed for "patching" ldap directories
       using ldif files.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the
       original program does not have a manual page.
