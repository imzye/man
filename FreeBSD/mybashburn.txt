NAME
       mybashburn - it can burn data cds/dvds and create mp3/ogg/flac.

DESCRIPTION
       MyBashBurn is a Terminal User Interface (TUI) frontend based of the CD
       burning shell script called BashBurn for Linux; this originally does
       not have the best eye-candy CD-burning UI, nevertheless, mybashburn
       uses dialog boxes/functions which draws (using ncurses) windows onto
       the screen. MyBashBurn dialog boxes offer good functionality, and has
       very good capabilities of automatically finding dependencies and auto
       detecting devices CD/DVD RW. In short, do not reinvent the wheel - just
       let MyBashBurn do what you want it to do.

       MyBashBurn can burn data cds, music cds, multisession cds. It can burn
       and create ISO files. It can burn bin/cue files, create mp3s, oggs and
       flac files. Supports burning DVD-images and data DVDs, and others funny
       options. MyBashBurn depends on cdrecord and others backend
       applications, so basically if your writing device works with it,
       MyBashBurn will work flawlessly.
