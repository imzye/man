NAME
       Chemistry::InternalCoords - Represent the position of an atom using
       internal coordinates and convert it to Cartesian coordinates.

SYNOPSIS
           use Chemistry::InternalCoords;

           # ... have a molecule in $mol
           my $atom = $mol->new_atom;

           # create an internal coordinate object for $atom
           # with respect to atoms with indices 4, 3, and 2.
           my $ic = Chemistry::InternalCoords->new(
               $atom, 4, 1.1, 3, 109.5, 2, 180.0
           );

           # can also use atom object references instead of indices
           ($atom4, $atom3, $atom2) = $mol->atoms(4,3,2);
           my $ic = Chemistry::InternalCoords->new(
               $atom, $atom4, 1.1, $atom3, 109.5, $atom2, 180.0
           );

           # calculate the Cartesian coordinates for
           # the atom from the internal coordinates
           my $vector = $ic->cartesians;

           # calculate and set permanently the Cartesian coordinates
           # for the atom from the internal coordinates
           my $vector = $ic->add_cartesians;
           # same as $atom->coords($ic->cartesians);

           # dump as string
           print $ic;
           # same as print $ic->stringify;

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements an object class for representing internal
       coordinates and provides methods for converting them to Cartesian
       coordinates.

       For generating an internal coordinate representation (aka a Z-matrix)
       of a molecule from its Cartesian coordinates, see the
       Chemistry::InternalCoords::Builder module.

       This module is part of the PerlMol project, <http://www.perlmol.org/>.

METHODS
       my $ic = Chemistry::InternalCoords->new($atom, $len_ref, $len_val,
       $ang_ref, $ang_val, $dih_ref, $dih_val)
           Create a new internal coordinate object. $atom is the atom to which
           the coordinates apply. $len_ref, $ang_ref, and $dih_ref are either
           atom references or atom indices and are used to specify the
           distance, angle, and dihedral that are used to define the current
           position. $len_val, $ang_val, and $dih_val are the values of the
           distance, angle, and dihedral. The angle and the dihedral are
           expected to be in degrees.

           For example,

               my $ic = Chemistry::InternalCoords->new(
                   $atom, 4, 1.1, 3, 109.5, 2, 180.0
               );

           means that $atom is 1.1 distance units from atom 4, the angle
           $atom-4-3 is 109.5 degrees, and the dihedral $atom-4-3-2 is 180.0
           degrees.

           The first three atoms in the molecule don't need all the internal
           coordinates: the first atom doesn't need anything (except for the
           atom reference $atom) because it will always be placed at the
           origin; the second atom only needs a distance, and it will be
           placed on the X axis; the third atom needs a distance and an angle,
           and it will be placed on the XY plane.

       my ($atom, $distance) = $ic->distance
           Return the atom reference and distance value contained in the
           Chemistry::InternalCoords object.

       my ($atom, $angle) = $ic->angle
           Return the atom reference and angle value contained in the
           Chemistry::InternalCoords object.

       my ($atom, $dihedral) = $ic->dihedral
           Return the atom reference and dihedral value contained in the
           Chemistry::InternalCoords object.

       my $vector = $ic->cartesians
           Calculate the Cartesian coordinates from an internal coordinate
           object.  Returns a Math::VectorReal object. Note that the Cartesian
           coordinates of the atoms referenced by the $ic object should
           already be calculated.

       my $vector = $ic->add_cartesians
           Same as $ic->cartesians, but also adds the newly calculated
           Cartesian coordinates to the atom. It is just shorthand for the
           following:

               $atom->coords($ic->cartesians);

           The best way of calculating the Cartesian coordinates for an entire
           molecule, assuming that every atom is defined only in terms of
           previous atoms (as it should be), is the following:

               # we have all the internal coords in @ics
               for my $ic (@ics) {
                   $ic->add_cartesians;
               }

       my $string = $ic->stringify
           Dump the object as a string representation. May be useful for
           debugging.  This method overloads the "" operator.
