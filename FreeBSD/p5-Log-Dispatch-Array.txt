Log::Dispatch::Array(3)                    User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Log::Dispatch::Array - log events to an array (reference)

VERSION
       version 1.003

SYNOPSIS
         use Log::Dispatch;
         use Log::Dispatch::Array;

         my $log = Log::Dispatch->new;

         my $target = [];

         $log->add(Log::Dispatch::Array->new(
           name      => 'text_table',
           min_level => 'debug',
           array     => $target,
         ));

         $log->warn($_) for @events;

         # now $target refers to an array of events

DESCRIPTION
       This provides a Log::Dispatch log output system that appends logged
       events to an array reference.  This is probably only useful for testing
       the logging of your code.

METHODS
   new
        my $table_log = Log::Dispatch::Array->new(\%arg);

       This method constructs a new Log::Dispatch::Array output object.  Valid
       arguments are:

         array - a reference to an array to append to; defaults to an attr on
                 $table_log

   array
       This method returns a reference to the array to which logging is being
       performed.

   log_message
       This is the method which performs the actual logging, as detailed by
       Log::Dispatch::Output.
