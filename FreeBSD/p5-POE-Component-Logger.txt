POE::Component::Logger(3)                  User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       POE::Component::Logger - A POE logging class

SYNOPSIS
       In your startup code somewhere:

         POE::Component::Logger->spawn(ConfigFile => 'log.conf');

       And later in an event handler:

         Logger->log("Something happened!");

DESCRIPTION
       POE::Component::Logger provides a simple logging component that uses
       Log::Dispatch::Config to drive it, allowing you to log to multiple
       places at once (e.g. to STDERR and Syslog at the same time) and also to
       flexibly define your logger's output.

       It is very simple to use, because it creates a Logger::log method (yes,
       this is namespace corruption, so shoot me). If you don't like this,
       feel free to post directly to your logger as follows:

         $kernel->post('logger', 'log', "An error occurred: $!");

       In fact you have to use that method if you pass an Alias option to
       spawn (see below).

       All logging is done in the background, so don't expect immediate output
       - the output will only occur after control goes back to the kernel so
       it can process the next event.

OPTIONS and METHODS
   "spawn"
       The spawn class method can take two options. A required ConfigFile
       option, which specifies the location of the config file as passed to
       Log::Dispatch::Config's configure() method (note that you can also use
       an object here, see Log::Dispatch::Config for more details). The other
       available option is Alias which you can use if you wish to have more
       than one logger in your POE application.  Note though that if you
       specify an alias other than the default 'logger' alias, you will not be
       able to use the "Logger->log" shortcut, and will have to use direct
       method calls instead.

   "Logger->log" / "POE::Component::Logger->log"
       This is used to perform a logging action. You may either pass a string,
       or a hashref. If you pass in a string it is logged at the level
       specified in $POE::Component::Logger::DefaultLevel, which is 'warning'
       by default. If you pass in a hashref it is expanded as a hash and
       passed to Log::Dispatch's log() method.

LOGGING STATES
       The following states are available on the POE logging session:

   "log"
       Same as "Logger->log()", except you may use a different alias if
       posting direct to the kernel, for example:

         $kernel->post( 'error.log', 'log', "Some error");
         $kernel->post( 'access.log', 'log', "Access Details");

   "debug"
       And also "notice", "info", "warning", "error", "critical", "emergency"
       and "alert".

       These states simply log at a different level. See Log::Dispatch for
       further details.

EXAMPLE CONFIG FILE
         # logs to screen (STDERR) and syslog
         dispatchers = screen syslog

         [screen]
         class = Log::Dispatch::Screen
         min_level = info
         stderr = 1
         format = %d %m %n

         [syslog]
         class = Log::Dispatch::Syslog
         min_level = warning
