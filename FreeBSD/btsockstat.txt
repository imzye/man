SYNOPSIS
     btsockstat [-nrh] [-M core] [-p protocol]

DESCRIPTION
     The btsockstat utility symbolically displays the contents of various
     Bluetooth sockets related data structures.  There are few output formats,
     depending on the options for the information presented.  The btsockstat
     utility will print results to the standard output and error messages to
     the standard error.

     The options are as follows:

     -h      Display usage message and exit.

     -M core
             Extract values associated with the name list from the specified
             core instead of the default /dev/kmem.

     -n      Show Bluetooth addresses as numbers.  Normally, btsockstat
             attempts to resolve Bluetooth addresses, and display them
             symbolically.

     -p protocol
             Display a list of active sockets (protocol control blocks) for
             each specified protocol.  Supported protocols are: hci_raw,
             l2cap_raw, l2cap, rfcomm and rfcomm_s.

     -r      Display a list of active routing entries (if any) for specified
             protocol.
