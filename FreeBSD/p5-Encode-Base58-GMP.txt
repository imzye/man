       For version 1.0 upgrades, please read the INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES section
       below.

SYNOPSIS
         use Encode::Base58::GMP;

         # Encode Int as Base58
         encode_base58(12345);                        # => 4ER string
         encode_base58('0x3039');                     # => 4ER string
         encode_base58(Math::GMPz->new('0x3039'));    # => 4ER string

         # Encode Int as Base58 using GMP alphabet
         encode_base58(12345,'bitcoin');              # => 4fr string
         encode_base58(12345,'gmp');                  # => 3cn string

         # Decode Base58 as Math::GMPz Int
         decode_base58('4ER');                        # => 12345 Math::GMPz object
         int decode_base58('4ER');                    # => 12345 integer

         # Decode Base58 as Math::GMPz Int using GMP alphabet
         decode_base58('4fr','bitcoin');              # => 12345 Math::GMPz object
         decode_base58('3cn','gmp');                  # => 12345 Math::GMPz object

         # MD5 Base58 Digest
         md5_base58('foo@bar.com');                   # => w6fdCRXnUXyz7EtDn5TgN9

         # Convert between alphabets for Bitcoin, Flickr and GMP
         base58_from_to('123456789abcdefghijk','flickr','gmp') # => 0123456789ABCDEFGHIJ
         base58_from_to('0123456789ABCDEFGHIJ','gmp','flickr') # => 123456789abcdefghijk

         # Convert between Flickr and GMP - Deprecated
         base58_flickr_to_gmp('123456789abcdefghijk') # => 0123456789ABCDEFGHIJ
         base58_gmp_to_flickr('0123456789ABCDEFGHIJ') # => 123456789abcdefghijk

DESCRIPTION
       Encode::Base58::GMP is a Base58 encoder/decoder implementation using
       the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP) with transcoding
       between Flickr, Bitcoin and GMP Base58 implementations. The Flickr
       alphabet is the default and used when no alphabet is provided.

       Flickr Alphabet: [0-9a-zA-Z] excluding [0OIl] to improve human
       readability

       Bitcoin Alphabet: [0-9A-Za-z] excluding [0OIl] to improve human
       readability

       GMP Alphabet: [0-9A-Za-v]

       The encode_base58, decode_base58 and md5_base58 methods support an
       alphabet parameter which can be set to the supported alphabets
       ['bitcoin', 'flickr', 'gmp'] to indicate the value to be encoded or
       decoded.

   Requirements
       This module requires GMP 4.2.0 and above. Prior versions are limited to
       Base36.

       Perl 5.8.9 or above is required to ensure proper bigint handling. If
       you are not using bigint numbers, it may be possible to skip the bigint
       tests and do a force install; however, lower Perl versions are not
       supported.

FUNCTIONS
   encode_base58 ( $number [, $alphabet ] )
       This routine encodes a $number in Base58. $number can be a Math::GMPz
       object or a binary, octal, decimal or hexidecimal number. Binary, octal
       and hexidecimal string literals must be prefixed with 0[Bb]/0/0[Xx]
       respectively. The Flickr alphabet is used unless $alphabet is set to
       'gmp'.

   decode_base58 ( $base58 [, $alphabet ] )
       This routine decodes a Base58 value and returns a Math::GMPz object.
       Use int on the return value to convert the Math::GMPz object to an
       integer.  The Flickr alphabet is used unless $alphabet is set to 'gmp'.

   base58_from_to( $base58, $from_alphabet, $to_alphabet )
       This routine encodes a Base58 string from one encoding to another
       encoding.  This routing is not exported by default.

   base58_flickr_to_gmp( $base58_as_flickr )
       This routine converts a Flickr Base58 string to a GMP Base58 string.
       This routine is not exported by default.

   base58_gmp_to_flickr( $base58_as_gmp )
       This routine converts a GMP Base58 string to a Flickr Base58 string.
       This routine is not exported by default.

   md5_base58( $data [, $alphabet ] )
       This routine returns a MD5 digest in Base58. This routine is not
       exported by default.

CHANGES
       1.00 April 30, 2013
           Add Bitcoin alphabet support.

           Add zero-padding for md5_base58. This is an incompatible change
           from version 0.09.

INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES
       1.00 April 30, 2013
           md5_base58 is now zero-padded to provide a fixed-length Base58
           string. Prior versions were not padding with leading zero values.
