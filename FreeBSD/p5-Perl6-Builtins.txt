NAME
       Perl6::Builtins - Provide Perl 5 versions of the new Perl 6 builtins

VERSION
       This document describes Perl6::Builtins version 0.0.3

SYNOPSIS
           use Perl6::Builtins qw( system );

           system $system_cmd
               or die "Could not $system_cmd: $!";

           my $package = caller->{package};
           my $file    = caller->{file};
           my $line    = caller->{line};

DESCRIPTION
       Several of the builtins in Perl 6 have different (i.e. more useful,
       less confusing) behaviours than their Perl 5 counterparts. This module
       provides Perl 5 versions of those builtins.

INTERFACE
       "system"
           If "system" is loaded on the use line, the builtin is altered so
           that it returns true if the system command suceeds. In any other
           context, the command returns the value in $!.

       "caller"
           If "caller" is loaded on the use line, the builtin is altered so
           that it behaves as in Perl 5 in scalar and list contexts. However,
           if the result of a call to "caller" is used as a hash reference it
           returns a reference to a hash with the following keys:

           'package'
           'file'
           'line'
           'sub'
           'args'
           'want'
           'eval'
           'require'
           'hints'
           'bitmask'

           with each of the values for these keys being the equivalent item
           from the list returned by "caller" in list context. This is useful
           because it means that, instead of:

               $subname = (caller)[3];

           you can write the much more readable:

               $subname = caller->{sub};

DIAGNOSTICS
       None.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
