DESCRIPTION
       gmx anaeig analyzes eigenvectors. The eigenvectors can be of a
       covariance matrix (gmx covar) or of a Normal Modes analysis (gmx
       nmeig).

       When a trajectory is projected on eigenvectors, all structures are
       fitted to the structure in the eigenvector file, if present, otherwise
       to the structure in the structure file. When no run input file is
       supplied, periodicity will not be taken into account. Most analyses are
       performed on eigenvectors -first to -last, but when -first is set to -1
       you will be prompted for a selection.

       -comp: plot the vector components per atom of eigenvectors -first to
       -last.

       -rmsf: plot the RMS fluctuation per atom of eigenvectors -first to
       -last (requires -eig).

       -proj: calculate projections of a trajectory on eigenvectors -first to
       -last.  The projections of a trajectory on the eigenvectors of its
       covariance matrix are called principal components (pc's).  It is often
       useful to check the cosine content of the pc's, since the pc's of
       random diffusion are cosines with the number of periods equal to half
       the pc index.  The cosine content of the pc's can be calculated with
       the program gmx analyze.

       -2d: calculate a 2d projection of a trajectory on eigenvectors -first
       and -last.

       -3d: calculate a 3d projection of a trajectory on the first three
       selected eigenvectors.

       -filt: filter the trajectory to show only the motion along eigenvectors
       -first to -last.

       -extr: calculate the two extreme projections along a trajectory on the
       average structure and interpolate -nframes frames between them, or set
       your own extremes with -max. The eigenvector -first will be written
       unless -first and -last have been set explicitly, in which case all
       eigenvectors will be written to separate files. Chain identifiers will
       be added when writing a .pdb file with two or three structures (you can
       use rasmol -nmrpdb to view such a .pdb file).

   Overlap calculations between covariance analysis
       Note: the analysis should use the same fitting structure

       -over: calculate the subspace overlap of the eigenvectors in file -v2
       with eigenvectors -first to -last in file -v.

       -inpr: calculate a matrix of inner-products between eigenvectors in
       files -v and -v2. All eigenvectors of both files will be used unless
       -first and -last have been set explicitly.

       When -v and -v2 are given, a single number for the overlap between the
       covariance matrices is generated. Note that the eigenvalues are by
       default read from the timestamp field in the eigenvector input files,
       but when -eig, or -eig2 are given, the corresponding eigenvalues are
       used instead. The formulas are:

                  difference = sqrt(tr((sqrt(M1) - sqrt(M2))^2))
          normalized overlap = 1 - difference/sqrt(tr(M1) + tr(M2))
               shape overlap = 1 - sqrt(tr((sqrt(M1/tr(M1)) - sqrt(M2/tr(M2)))^2))

       where M1 and M2 are the two covariance matrices and tr is the trace of
       a matrix. The numbers are proportional to the overlap of the square
       root of the fluctuations. The normalized overlap is the most useful
       number, it is 1 for identical matrices and 0 when the sampled subspaces
       are orthogonal.

       When the -entropy flag is given an entropy estimate will be computed
       based on the Quasiharmonic approach and based on Schlitter's formula.

              get 3 or 6 eigenvalues that are very close to zero, and which
              should not be taken into account when computing the entropy.
