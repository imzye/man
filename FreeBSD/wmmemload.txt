NAME
       wmmemload - A dockapp to monitor memory/swap usages

SYNOPSIS
       wmmemload [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the wmmemload command.

       WMMemLoad is a program to monitor memory/swap usages. It is a dockapp
       that is supported by X window managers such as Window Maker, AfterStep,
       BlackBox, and Enlightenment.

       The current memory usage is displayed in the top half.  The swap usage
       is in the bottom half. It has an LCD look-alike user interface.  The
       back-light may be turned on/off by clicking the mouse button over the
       appliacation. If the usage hits a certain threshold, an alarm-mode will
       alert you by turning on back-light.
