NAME
       Math::Geometry - Geometry related functions

SYNOPSIS
               use Math::Geometry;

               @P2=rotx(@P1,$angle);
               @P3=rotx(@P1,$angle);
               @N =triangle_normal(@P1,@P2,@P3);
               @ZP=zplane_project(@P1,$d);

NOTES
       This is about to get a massive overhaul, but first im adding tests,
       lots of lovely lovely tests.

       Currently for zplane_project onto a plane with normal of the z axis and
       z=0, the function returns the orthographic projections as opposed to a
       perspective projection. I'm currently looking into how to properly
       handle z=0 and will update it shortly.

DESCRIPTION
       This package implements classic geometry methods. It should be
       considered alpha software and any feedback at all is greatly
       appreciated. The following methods are available:

   vector_product.
       Also known as the cross product, given two vectors in Geometry space,
       the vector_product of the two vectors, is a vector which is
       perpendicular to the plane of AB with length equal to the length of A
       multiplied by the length of B, multiplied by the sin of @, where @ is
       the angle between the two vectors.

   triangle_normal
       Given a triangle ABC that defines a plane P. This function will return
       a vector N, which is a normal to the plane P.

           ($Nx,$Ny,$Nz) =
              triangle_normal(($Ax,$Ay,$Az),($Bx,$By,$Bz),($Cx,$Cy,$Cz));

   zplane_project
       Project a point in Geometry space onto a plane with the z-axis as the
       normal, at a distance d from z=0.

           ($x2,$y2,$z2) = zplane_project ($x1,$y1,$z1,$d);

   rotx
       Rotate about the x axis r radians.

           ($x2,$y2,$z2) = rotx ($x1,$y1,$z1,$r);

   roty
       Rotate about the y axis r radians.

           ($x2,$y2,$z2) = roty ($x1,$y1,$z1,$r);

   rotz
       Rotate about the z axis r radians.

           ($x2,$y2,$z2) = rotz ($x1,$y1,$z1,$r);

   deg2rad
       Convert degree's to radians.

   rad2deg
       Convert radians to degree's.

   pi
       Returns an approximate value of Pi, the code has been cribed from
       Pg146, Programming Perl 2nd Ed.

EXAMPLE
           use Math::Geometry;
