PMAP_MINCORE(9)        FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual       PMAP_MINCORE(9)

NAME
     pmap_mincore – determine if a virtual address is resident in physical
     memory

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <vm/vm.h>
     #include <vm/pmap.h>

     int
     pmap_mincore(pmap_t pmap, vm_offset_t addr);

DESCRIPTION
     The pmap_mincore() function determines if the page at the virtual address
     addr in the physical map pmap is resident in physical memory.  It is the
     machine-dependent interface used by the mincore(2) system call.

RETURN VALUES
     If the page is resident in physical memory, a mask of flags is returned,
     whose meaning is documented in mincore(2); otherwise, 0 is returned.

     The pmap must exist and addr must be mapped into the pmap.  If any error
     occurs, the machine-dependent implementation should return 0.
