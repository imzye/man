NAME
       xawele - a strategy game for X

SYNOPSIS
       xawele or awelewish -f xawele


DESCRIPTION
       The game of Awele is a popular african game, also known as "Sungo" or
       "Ubao". It is made of a wooden board with 12 holes containing some kind
       of stones. The aim is to capture as many stones as possible. There
       exist varieties of rules. I implemented the one I know, which is one of
       the most popular (in Ivory Coast at least).

       xawele is a Tcl/Tk script, with some routines written in C. The
       interpreter is awelewish.

       There is no command line options.


PLAYING
       Select your opponent's level using the "level" menu. Rules are
       explained in english (select rules in the "misc" menu) and in french
       (select regles).  Button 1 on a non empty square plays this square;
       button 2 shows where the last stone is dropped if you choose this
       square. You have the possibility to undo one move.
