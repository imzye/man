CD-DISCID(1)            FreeBSD General Commands Manual           CD-DISCID(1)

NAME
       cd-discid - read CD and get CDDB discid information

SYNOPSIS
       cd-discid [option...]

DESCRIPTION
       In order to do CDDB queries over the Internet, you must know the DiscID
       of the CD you are querying.  cd-discid provides you with that
       information. It outputs the discid, the number of tracks, the frame
       offset of all of the tracks, and the total length of the CD in seconds,
       on one line in a space-delimited format.  cd-discid was designed as a
       backend tool for cdgrab (now abcde) but will work independently of it.

OPTIONS
       --musicbrainz
              Output a TOC that is suitable for calculating the MusicBrainz
              disc id.

       --help Display a brief help message.

       --version
              Show the version.

       devicename
              CD-ROM block device name that contains the CD to be queried. If
              this option is omitted, the following device name is assumed:

              /dev/cdrom
                     Linux, FreeBSD and DragonFly

                     OpenBSD and NetBSD

              /dev/vol/aliases/cdrom0
