STRSPN(3)              FreeBSD Library Functions Manual              STRSPN(3)

NAME
     strspn, strcspn – span a string

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <string.h>

     size_t
     strspn(const char *s, const char *charset);

     size_t
     strcspn(const char *s, const char *charset);

DESCRIPTION
     The strspn() function spans the initial part of the null-terminated
     string s as long as the characters from s occur in the null-terminated
     string charset.  In other words, it computes the string array index of
     the first character of s which is not in charset, else the index of the
     first null character.

     The strcspn() function spans the initial part of the null-terminated
     string s as long as the characters from s do not occur in the null-
     terminated string charset (it spans the complement of charset).  In other
     words, it computes the string array index of the first character of s
     which is also in charset, else the index of the first null character.

RETURN VALUES
     The strspn() and strcspn() functions return the number of characters
     spanned.

STANDARDS
     The strspn() and strcspn() functions conform to ISO/IEC 9899:1990
     (“ISO C90”).
