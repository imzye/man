NAME
       eqe: GUI image generator from LaTeX input

SYNOPSIS
        eqe

        eqe --help

DESCRIPTION
       eqe is a graphical tool to generate an image from LaTeX input.  It will
       save images to any format supported by  ImagMagick.  It supports drag
       and drop to other applications in various ways.

       OpenOffice Impress 1.x accepts drag and drop from "eqe", but links to
       "eqe"'s temporary file. To include the image inside the presentation,
       in OOImpress, use Edit -> Links... -> Break link.  OpenOffice 2.x works
       fine without this workaround.

       Inside eqe, click the image to regenerate it. You can also use Shift-
       Return, and the Enter key on the keypad.

       It relies on eqedit to do the actual image generation.

OPTIONS
       --help
           Displays the list of command line options.

       --version
           Displays the current version of "eqe".

       --verbose
           Displays messages about what "eqe" is doing.

       --latex-template=<file> [template.tt.tex]
           LaTeX template to use. eqedit searches for the template (by
           default, template.tt.tex) in $HOME/.eqe/, /usr/local/share/eqe/,
           /usr/share/eqe/.  If it cannot be found, it uses a builtin
           template.  You may specify just a name (searched for in the search
           path), or an absolute or relative path to the template to be used.
           The template is in a format described in "perldoc
           Template::Manual::Syntax" (ie, the Template Toolkit syntax).

       --eqedit=<eqedit executable> [eqedit]
           Specifies the name of the "eqedit" binary used to generate images
           from LaTeX input ("eqedit" is distributed with "eqe").  Can be an
           absolute path, or just a name ("eqe" will search for it in the
           PATH).

       --keep-temp [off]
           Whether to keep temporary files. Together with "--verbose", useful
           for debugging.
