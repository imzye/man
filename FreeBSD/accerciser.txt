DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly accerciser.

       accerciser is an interactive Python accessibility explorer for the
       GNOME desktop. It uses AT-SPI to inspect and control widgets, allowing
       you to check if an application is providing correct information to
       assistive technologies and automated test frameworks. Accerciser has a
       simple plug-in framework which you can use to create custom views of
       accessibility information.
