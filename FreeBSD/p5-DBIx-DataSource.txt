NAME
       DBIx::DataSource - Database-independant create and drop functions

SYNOPSIS
         use DBIx::DataSource qw( create_database drop_database );

         create_database( $data_source, $username, $password )
           or warn $DBIx::DataSource::errstr;

         drop_database( $data_source, $username, $password )
           or warn $DBIx::DataSource::errstr;

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements create_database and drop_database functions for
       databases.  It aims to provide a common interface to database creation
       and deletion regardless of the actual database being used.

       Currently supported databases are MySQL and PostgreSQL.  Assistance
       adding support for other databases is welcomed and relatively simple -
       see DBIx::DataSource::Driver.

FUNCTIONS
       create_database DATA_SOURCE USERNAME PASSWORD
           Create the database specified by the given DBI data source.

       drop_database DATA_SOURCE
           Drop the database specified by the given DBI data source.
