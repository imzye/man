DateTime::Format::DateManip(3)             User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       DateTime::Format::DateManip - Perl DateTime extension to convert
       Date::Manip dates and durations to DateTimes and vice versa.

SYNOPSIS
         use Date::Manip;
         use DateTime::Format::DateManip;

         # Date::Manip to DateTime
         my $dm = ParseDate("January 1st, 2001");
         my $dt = DateTime::Format::DateManip->parse_datetime($dm);

         $dt->add( weeks => 1 );

         # And back again
         my $dm2 = DateTime::Format::DateManip->format_datetime($dt);

         # Same thing with a duration
         my $dm_delta  = ParseDateDelta("3 years 2 days -4 hours +3mn -2 second");
         my $dt_dur    = DateTime::Format::DateManip->parse_duration($dm_delta);
         my $dm_delta2 = DateTime::Format::DateManip->format_duration($dt_dur);

         # Note that we can parse any string that is in the appropriate format
         # there is no need to call ParseDate or ParseDateDelta first:
         my $dt2     = DateTime::Format::DateManip->parse_datetime("In 2 hours");
         my $dt_dur2 = DateTime::Format::DateManip->parse_duration("3 years");

DESCRIPTION
       DateTime::Format::DateManip is a class that knows how to convert
       between "Date::Manip" dates and durations and "DateTime" and
       "DateTime::Duration" objects.  Recurrences are note yet supported.

USAGE
   Time Zones
       "Date::Manip" can have a time zone set globally and it keeps the dates
       it produces in the local time.  In all cases we rely on the GMT offset
       to set up the "DateTime" object.  However, we try to work out what the
       matching timezone is using the "DateTime" nomenclature and create the
       object in the correct time zone so the date is correct if dajustments
       to the date object pushes it over a DST change.  Note that we call
       "set_time_zone" to make the change, so the absolute time is not
       affected by the time zone change.

       However, not all "Date::Manip" time zones have reasonable mappings (for
       example NT and CAT both appear to be obsolete).  It is unlikely that a
       user will have their time zone set to one of these items.  If we are
       unable to work out the mapping we simply use the GMT offset and do not
       set a timezone.

       When converting to a "Date::Manip" we only need to tell "Date::Manip"
       the GMT offset and it will automatically convert to the local time zone
       that is in effect.

   Class Methods
       •   parse_datetime( $date_manip_string )

           This method takes the input string and returns the corresponding
           "DateTime" object.  If "Date::Manip::ParseDate" was unable to parse
           the input string then undef will be returned.  See the note above
           about Time Zones.

       •   format_datetime( $datetime_object )

           This method takes the given "DateTime" object and returns a
           corresponding "Date::Manip::ParseDate" parseable string.  See the
           note above about Time Zones.

       •   parse_duration( $date_manip_duration_string )

           This method takes the giben duration string and returns the
           corresponding "DateTime::Duration" object.  If
           "Date::Manip::ParseDateDelta" was unable to parse the input string
           then undef will be returned.

       •   format_duration( $datetime_duration_object )

           This method takes the given "DateTime::Duration" object and returns
           a corresponding "Date::Manip::ParseDateDelta" parseable string.
