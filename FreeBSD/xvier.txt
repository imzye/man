NAME
       xvier - a X11 board game.

SYNOPSIS
       xvier [ -display displayname ] [ -geometry geometry ] [ -fn fontpattern
       ] [ -iconic ] [ -rows rows ] [ -columns columns ] [ -prog programpath ]
       [ -level levelnumber ]

DESCRIPTION
       Xvier is a board game where you and the computer alternately throw
       stones into free columns. The stones pile up in the columns, and the
       goal is to get four stones in a row, in a column or diagonally. You can
       choose various board sizes and levels of difficulty.

       During the game you click with the mouse onto the column where you want
       to put your stone. Another possibility is a lower case letter in the
       range 'a' to 'm' (maximally) where 'a' is the left column. If you want
       to change the level of difficulty, you must use the keyboard.  Simply
       type the number of the desired level. These levels correspond to the
       search depth of the game program. The meaning of the command line
       options and buttons is given below.

       While the game program computes a move, everything besides Change and
       Quit is blocked.

OPTIONS

              The X11 screen you want to use.

       -geometry geometry

       -fn fontpattern
              A pattern describing the fonts which are used for the buttons
              and messages.  Xvier chooses the biggest font that fits into the
              window. Therefore the pattern should describe different sizes of
              one font. The default is *-Helvetica-Medium-R-Normal-*.

              Start in iconic state.

              The number of rows of the board. The possible range is 4 to 13.
              The default is 6.

       -columns columns
              The number of columns of the board. The possible range is 4 to
              13. The default is 7.

       -prog programpath
              The path of the game program.

       -level levelnumber
              The level of difficulty to start with. The possible range is 0
              to 9.  The default is 0.

BUTTONS
       The keyboard equivalents of the buttons are given in brackets.

       Quit ['q' or 'Q']   Finish the game.

       New ['n' or 'N']    Start a new game.

       Undo ['u' or 'U']   Undo one move.

       Start ['s' or 'S']  Let the computer begin with the first move. The
                           board must be empty.

       Change ['C']        Exchange the colours of your and the computer's
                           stones.
