FLOWCTL(8)              FreeBSD System Manager's Manual             FLOWCTL(8)

NAME
     flowctl – ng_netflow(4) control utility

SYNOPSIS
     flowctl [-d level] path command

DESCRIPTION
     The flowctl utility is intended to control the ng_netflow(4) nodes.  It
     has a single option:

     -d level        Set the netgraph(3) debugging level to level.

COMMANDS
     Currently, flowctl supports only one command.

     show [ipv4|ipv6] [human|verbose]
               This command is the analog of the “show ip cache flow” command
               of a Cisco router.  It dumps the contents of the flow cache in
               Cisco-like format.  Specifying either ipv4 or ipv6 would
               extract only IPv4 or IPv6 flows respectively.  It has optional
               parameter verbose, which is analog of the “show ip cache
               verbose flow” command. Additionally, human parameter can be
               specify to show selected flows in human-readable format.

EXIT STATUS
     The flowctl utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
