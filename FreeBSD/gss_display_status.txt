GSS_DISPLAY_STATUS(3)                   FreeBSD Library Functions Manual (prm)

NAME
     gss_display_status – Convert a GSS-API status code to text

SYNOPSIS
     #include <gssapi/gssapi.h>

     OM_uint32
     gss_display_status(OM_uint32 *minor_status, OM_uint32 status_value,
         int status_type, const gss_OID mech_type, OM_uint32 *message_context,
         gss_buffer_t status_string);

DESCRIPTION
     Allows an application to obtain a textual representation of a GSS-API
     status code, for display to the user or for logging purposes.  Since some
     status values may indicate multiple conditions, applications may need to
     call gss_display_status() multiple times, each call generating a single
     text string.  The message_context parameter is used by
     gss_display_status() to store state information about which error
     messages have already been extracted from a given status_value;
     message_context must be initialized to zero by the application prior to
     the first call, and gss_display_status() will return a non-zero value in
     this parameter if there are further messages to extract.

     The message_context parameter contains all state information required by
     gss_display_status() in order to extract further messages from the
     status_value; even when a non-zero value is returned in this parameter,
     the application is not required to call gss_display_status() again unless
     subsequent messages are desired.  The following code extracts all
     messages from a given status code and prints them to stderr:

     OM_uint32 message_context;
     OM_uint32 status_code;
     OM_uint32 maj_status;
     OM_uint32 min_status;
     gss_buffer_desc status_string;

            ...

     message_context = 0;

     do {

       maj_status = gss_display_status (
                       &min_status,
                       status_code,
                       GSS_C_GSS_CODE,
                       GSS_C_NO_OID,
                       &message_context,
                       &status_string)

       fprintf(stderr,
               "%.*s\n",
              (int)status_string.length,
              (char *)status_string.value);

       gss_release_buffer(&min_status, &status_string);

     } while (message_context != 0);

PARAMETERS
     minor_status      Mechanism specific status code.

     status_value      Status value to be converted

     status_type

                       GSS_C_GSS_CODE       status_value is a GSS status code

                       GSS_C_MECH_CODE      status_value is a mechanism status
                                            code

     mech_type         Underlying mechanism (used to interpret a minor status
                       value).  Supply GSS_C_NO_OID to obtain the system
                       default.

     message_context   Should be initialized to zero by the application prior
                       to the first call.  On return from
                       gss_display_status(), a non-zero status_value parameter
                       indicates that additional messages may be extracted
                       from the status code via subsequent calls to
                       gss_display_status(), passing the same status_value,
                       status_type, mech_type, and message_context parameters.

     status_string     Textual interpretation of the status_value.  Storage
                       associated with this parameter must be freed by the
                       application after use with a call to
                       gss_release_buffer().

RETURN VALUES
     GSS_S_COMPLETE        Successful completion

     GSS_S_BAD_MECH        Indicates that translation in accordance with an
                           unsupported mechanism type was requested

     GSS_S_BAD_STATUS      The status value was not recognized, or the status
                           type was neither GSS_C_GSS_CODE nor
                           GSS_C_MECH_CODE.
