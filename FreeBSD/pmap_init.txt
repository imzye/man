PMAP_INIT(9)           FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual          PMAP_INIT(9)

NAME
     pmap_init, pmap_init2 – initialize the pmap subsystem

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <vm/vm.h>
     #include <vm/pmap.h>

     void
     pmap_init(void);

     void
     pmap_init2(void);

DESCRIPTION
     The pmap_init() function initializes the pmap(9) sub-system.  It is
     called during system initialization by vm_init(), to initialize any
     structures that the pmap_init system needs in order to map between
     physical and virtual memory.

     The pmap_init2() function initializes a zone for the PV entries.  These
     are used to implement page sharing at the physical level.  A high water
     mark is set so that the system can recover from excessive numbers of PV
     entries.
