DESCRIPTION
       The original puzzle has 8 sectors on a sphere (longitudinal cuts), with
       each sector divided into 4 segments (latitudinal cuts).  There are
       essentially 3 varieties: Geomaster 8 colors (beachball, default colors
       in this puzzle), Duomaster 2 colors (black and white beachball), and a
       variety of picture Masterballs.  For some reason, they say the
       Geomaster is harder than the Duomaster.  The picture Masterballs are
       the hardest since all the pieces have a set solved postion.  On the Duo
       and Geo Masterballs pieces could be swapped or in a different order and
       still be in a solved postion.  Zurick University's Mathematics faculty
       has calculated that Masterball's 32 segments can be arranged in
       355,682,548,566,633,480,192,000,000 different possible combinations.
       Masterball was invented by Dr. Geza Gyovai Hungarian Engineer,
       manufactured by Whole Systems Design, Inc..

FEATURES
       Press "mouse-left" button to move a sector.  Release "mouse-left"
       button on another piece and the pieces will turn towards where the
       mouse button is released.  Usually, a click and release on the same
       wedge is ambiguous and the puzzle will not turn.

       Click "mouse-center", or press "P" or "p" keys to toggle the practice
       mode (in practice mode the record should say "practice").  One must
       double click on "mouse-center" if the puzzle is being worked on.  This
       is good for learning moves and experimenting.

       Click "mouse-right", or press "R" or "r" keys to randomize (this must
       be done first to set a new record).  One must double click on "mouse-
       right" if the puzzle is being worked on.

       Press "I" or "i" keys to increase the number of rings.

       Press "D" or "d" keys to decrease the number of rings.

       Press "O" or "o" keys to toggle the orient mode.  One has to orient the
       wedges in orient mode, besides getting all the wedges to be the same
       color.  To do this one has to get the numbers to be on the same side of
       the ball in clockwise order.

       Press "2", "4", "6", or  "8" keys (not the keypad 2, 4, 6, 8) to change
       to 2, 4, 6, or 8 wedges, respectively.  Note: if there were odd number
       of wedges, there would be no 180 degree turn and therefore the puzzle
       would be inoperable.

       "S" or "s" are reserved for the auto-solver (unimplemented).

       Press "U" or "u" keys to undo move.

       Press "G" or "g" keys to get a saved puzzle.

       Press "W" or "w" keys to write or save a puzzle.

       Press "Q", "q", or "CTRL-C" keys to kill program.

       Use the key pad, "R" keys, or arrow keys to move without mouse clicks.
       Key pad is defined for Masterball as:
         /     Counterclockwise

       7 8 9   Upper Left, Up, Upper Right
         ^
       4<5>6   Left, Clockwise, Right
         v
       1 2 3   Lower Left, Down, Lower Right

       Use the control key and the left mouse button, keypad, or arrow keys to
       move the whole Masterball.  This is not recorded as a turn.

       The title is in the following format (non-motif version):
              xmball.{2|4|6|8<wedges>}: <number of sectors per wedge> @
              (<Number of moves>/{<Record number of moves> <username>|"NEVER
              noaccess"|"practice"}) - <Comment>
       If there is no record of the current puzzle, it displays "NEVER
       noaccess".

OPTIONS
       -geometry {+|-}X{+|-}Y
               This option sets the initial position of the masterball window
               (resource name "geometry").

       -display host:dpy
               This option specifies the X server to contact.

       -[no]mono
               This option allows you to  display on a color screen as if
               monochrome (resource name "mono").

       -[no]{reverse|rv}
               This option allows you to see the masterball window in reverse
               video (resource name "reverse").

       -{foreground|fg} color
               This option specifies the foreground of the masterball window
               (resource name "foreground").

       -{background|bg} color
               This option specifies the background of the masterball window
               (resource name "background").

       -{border|bd} color
               This option specifies the border color of the sectors in the
               masterball window (resource name "borderColor").

       -wedge{0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7} <color>
               This option allows you to change the color of a wedge (resource
               name "wedgeColorN"). In mono-mode, color is represented as the
               first letter of the color name. The wedges are ordered
               clockwise.  If you have two colors that begin with the same
               letter you should have one in uppercase and one in lowercase to
               distinguish them in mono-mode. You can change the colors of the
               wedges to make a stupid Masterball (i.e. all White or in mono-
               mode all "W").  Unfortunately, it will not normally say its
               solved when its randomized.  Similarly, with the Duomasterball
               (black and white), it may be solved color-wise but not by its
               internal representation.  This would be cheating.

       -wedges <int>
               This option allows you to change the number of wedges (resource
               name "wedges").

       -rings <int>
               This option allows you to change the number of rings (resource
               name "rings").

       -[no]orient
               This option allows you to access the orient mode (resource name
               "orient").

       -[no]practice
               This option allows you to access the practice mode (resource
               name "practice").

       -base int
               This option specifies the base used (default is base 16)
               (resource name "base").  When there are 12 wedges there is not
               much room, so base 10 was not used as the default.

       -username string
               This option specifies the user name for any records made or
               else it will get your login name (resource name "userName").

SAVE FORMAT
       The format is not standard.  The reason for this is that this is simple
       and I do not know what the standard is.

       Masterball numbered clockwise, with default colors, not randomized:
           0            Y       Yellow
        7     1      D     B    Dark Green, Blue

       6       2    C       R   Cyan, Red

        5     3      O     M    Orange, Magenta
           4            G       Green

              wedges: 1-8 <number of wedges around ball>
              rings: 1-MAXINT <number of slices around ball>
              orient: 0-1 <0 false, 1 true; if true then numbers on puzzle to
              be oriented and ordered>
              practice: 0-1 <0 false, 1 true>
              moves: 0-MAXINT <total number of moves>

              startingPosition: <2 dimensional array of sector wedge position,
              if orient mode then orientation number follows each wedge
              number>

       This is then followed by the moves, starting from 1.
              move #: <wedge> <ring> <direction> <control>
       Each turn is with respect to a sector defined by wedge and ring.
       Direction is represented as 0 up, 1 right, 2 down, 3 left, 4 upper
       right, 5 lower right, 6 lower left, 7 upper left, 9 clockwise, and 15
       counterclockwise.
       Control is represented as 0 or 1, 1 if the whole ball is moved at once,
       0 if not.  The xmball record keeper does not count a control move as a
       move, but here we do.

       Caution: the program may crash on corrupted input.
