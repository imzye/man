SND_ICH(4)             FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual             SND_ICH(4)

NAME
     snd_ich – Intel ICH AC'97 and compatible bridge device driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device sound
           device snd_ich

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           snd_ich_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The snd_ich bridge driver allows the generic audio driver sound(4) to
     attach to Intel ICH AC'97 and compatible audio devices.

     Some later chips, like ICH6/ICH7, depending on wiring can instead
     implement newer Intel HD Audio specification, which is supported by
     snd_hda(4) driver.
