NAME
       atom - ASCII-to-markup filter

SYNOPSIS
       atom -t - B{1to5}- [<number>eipQTsht] file...

DESCRIPTION
       atom automatically translates typewriter quotes into those which are
       displayed as properly typeset quotation marks for HTML.

       Additionally, this filter also turns italics-delimited words or phrases
       into italics when displayed by LaTeX or HTML.  The default delimiter to
       indicate that italics be displayed is the asterisk.  This is
       configurable by simply editing the #define in atom.h.  And, for LaTeX
       only, atom correctly sets the markup to correctly display ellipses.
       The LaTeX markup is being discounted; it will likely eventually vanish.

       The following options apply:

       -B   Followed by the digit 1,2,3,4, or 5  inserts that many
       <BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE> tags.  As a default there are 4 <BLOCKQUOTE>
       tags.

       -c   Perform simplistic centering processing.

       -e   Do not do ellipses processing. (Affects LaTeX only.)

       -<number>   <number> indicates the number of space-indentations that
       indicates a paragraph.  (This is explained further below.)  This option
       is also going away; eventually only an empty line or a TAB will
       indicate an ASCII paragraph, or a standard ASCII 5-spaces will indicate
       a paragraph.

       -I   Process italics marks only. The resulting output file is
       postpended with IO.

       -i   Do not handle italics processing.

       -p   Handles physical-spacing by inserting five ``<BR>'' tags in HTML
       and the markup ``\vspace*{.5in}'' for TeX and LaTeX.  The option
       requires that you have exactly five blank lines in your manuscript.

       -Q   Process double-quotation marks only. The resulting output file is
       postpended with QO.  With this flag "Such a line." would be translated
       simply to &ldquo;Such a line.&rdquo

       Note that to efficiently process double-quotes, you may want to use tr
       to join all lines in any paragraph.  [ Still at work on this!]

             This flag does not need the additional -t flag.

       -t   Process some very slight TeX/LaTeX output (DEPRECATED)  (The -h
       flag is gone, turned into a "help" output function. HTML is the
       default.)

       TeX is no longer the default for atom.  The program handles italics and
       ellipses under TeX or LaTeX, and processes any italics-delimited word
       or words into HTML emphasis tags if this flag is specified.

       Paragraphs are most easily recognized by lines of text separated by at
       least one newline.  Additionally, a line in which the first character
       is a tab ('\010') indicates a paragraph.  Lastly, and these are the
       least preferred means of paragraph recognition, lines in which at least
       the first character is a space--or the first several character are
       spaces--followed by tab indicates a paragraph; or lines which begin
       with 5 or 8 spaces ('\040') are recognized as paragraphs.

       If you have used an ``unusual'' number of spaces to indicate paragraphs
       in your manuscript--say, two, three, six, or seven spaces, you must
       indicate this to atom with the -<number> flag.  If you have paragraphed
       with seven spaces and want an HTML outfile, you must type ``atom -7h
       <yourfile>'' on the command line.   For reasons that should be fairly
       obvious, if you have ``atom -7h <yourfile>'' then 5- or 8-space-
       indented paragraphs won't be seen as paragraphs.

       If your manuscript has any mix of tabs, 8-spaces, and 5-spaces to
       indicate paragraphs you do not need to use the ``-<number>'' option.

       If you are about to prepare an ASCII file, best to stick with TABS or
       spaces to indicate paragraphs.

EXAMPLES
       For example, the following

               % atom -te speech01


       will correctly format speech01 into LaTeX, and produce the output file
       speech01.tex.  Quotation marks and italicization will be handled in the
       LaTeX-markup output file; ellipses will not be processed.

       The following:

               % atom -hi ShortStory


       will produce the output ShortStory.html in which double quotation marks
       will be processed but any italics-delimited words will be left alone.

       The following command

               % atom -h2 testFile


       where exactly <2> or <number> spaces indicate paragraphs within the
       file test, will produce a properly formatted HTML output file.

       For example:


         This is a case where there is a new
       paragraph that is indicated by a 2-space indentation.
       This happens occasionally.
         And this is yet another instance of the
       above. For atom to turn these two paragraphs into HTML or TeX
       formatted paragraphs, use the command: ``atom -h2 <file>'' or
       ``atom -t2 <file>.''



       will produce the following:


       <P>
         This is a case where there is a new
       paragraph that is indicated by a 2-space indentation.
       This happens occasionally.
       <P>
         And this is yet another instance of the
       above. For atom to turn these two paragraphs into HTML or TeX
       formatted paragraphs, use the command: ``atom -h2 <file>'' or
       ``atom -t2 <file>.''



       Note that without the ``-2'' flag in this case, the HTML or TeX output
       would run these two paragraphs together.

       The commands
            % atom -Q lglass18.txt       # translate quotations marks to `` and ''
       will produce ``lglass18.txt.QO.html.''

       Finally,

               % atom -t story01 story02 story12

       will produce story01.tex, story02.tex, story12.tex with any quotation
       marks, italicization, and ellipses marked up in LaTeX style.

       atom will do centering if and only if your original ASCII file has the
       strings judiciously centered by using spaces-only to the left of the
       centered string.  If you use this -c option, any paragraphs that are
       denoted by 5 or 8 spaces will not be seen as paragraphs and not
       processed as such.  If you do have space-centered lines that you wish
       to be centered in HTML or LaTeX  and you also have paragraphs denoted
       by 5 or 8 spaces, you will have to edit your ASCII source and replace
       the spaces to tabs.  Then run atom to handle the centering.

       Note that in this simple filter, centered text is best if only one or
       two lines.  atom will not handle multiple lines of centering
       efficiency.

       The latest version of atom automatically puts only a single paragraph
       tag, ``<P>'' between what are understood as paragraph, namely, a single
       vertical line space {or newline}.  Previously, if the source file had
       thee newlines, there would be three paragraph tags, each on it's own
       newline.  In short, the -s switch is history.


NOTES
       Any series of three dots  (...)  is, for LaTeX, considered to be an
       ellipse.

       This program could be expanded to handle boldface markup, but this
       would require having another delimiter, and we are creating yet another
       markup language.

       I admittedly am tempted to have this filter handle a maximum of two
       types of markup:  the standard _underscore_ for italics or <EM>, and
       the *asterisk* for bold or <STRONG>.  ...But not that tempted!

       Finally, it is worth noting that if your plain ASCII file has a lengthy
       italicized string--something that exceeds 80 columns, for example--the
       best solution is to simply join the lines of your italicized string.
