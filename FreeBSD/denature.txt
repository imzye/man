NAME
       denature -- A script to convert an html file to an xsl-fo file, then
       using FOP, to a pdf.

SYNOPSIS
       denature [-i dir] [-c dir] [-l] [-s] [-f] [-e] [-w] [-d] [-p] [-t] [-h]
       <input file> <output file>

DESCRIPTION
       denature will parse through the given HTML file and produce a roughly
       equilavent PDF file. denature should be able to recognize most HTML
       files, but if the file is significantly ill-formed the parser may have
       problems.

       denature can add page breaks into the output pdf file. The placement of
       the page breaks is controlled by comments inside the HTML file. When a
       page break is desired place a <!-- PAGEBREAK --> command and a new page
       will be started before the next block of text. This can have funny
       consequences if the pagebreak is place inside a table data cell, so be
       careful where the break is placed.

OPTIONS
       -i dir -- image directory.
            Directory where images used in the HTML document are located.

       -c dir -- css file directory.
            Directory where the CSS file used is located, if needed.

       -l -- landscape mode.
            Will attempt to print the PDF as a landscape page (EXPERIMENTAL).

       -s -- SVG graphics.
            This will enable the use of SVG graphics to draw some portions of
            the input fields. This requires a vaild DISPLAY variable to be set
            and a vaild X server because the java.awt packages are used to
            draw the images.

       -f -- footer.
            Will print a footer on the bottom of each page containing p. <page
            num>.

       -e -- header.
            Will print a header on the top of each page containing the
            <title></title> contents.

       -p -- padding.
            Will turn on the usage of the padding tag in CSS. This can cause
            some funny things in the output at the moment.

       -w -- warning.
            Will print out warning information.

       -d -- debug.
            Will print out debug information (this includes warnings). Only
            needed for development.

       -t -- test only
            Used to test denature, does not run fop and leaves the temporary
            xml file around.

       -h -- help.
            Prints out a brief help message.

ENVIRONMENT
       There are several external dependancies which denature requres to
       execute. They are:

       HTML-Tagset (perl module)
       HTML-Parser (perl module)
       HTML-Tree (perl module)
       CSS::Tiny (perl module)
       FOP
       JDK

       The perl modules should be available through CPAN http://www.cpan.org,
       while FOP is available from http://xml.apache.org/fop/index.html.

       Once all the requirements are installed two variables at the top of the
       denature script need to be set to the FOP and JDK install directories.
       The variables are:

       $fop_home
            The directory that contains the fop.sh script.

       $java_home
            The directory that contains the JDK (This is the same as the
            JAVA_HOME environment variable).  The the JDK version required
            should be specified on the FOP website.

       Once these variables are set denature should work correctly.

LIMITATIONS
       denature does not currently handle all of HTML. As unknown tags are
       encountered they are added in.

       Not all <form> elements are handled, or only handled if the SVG flag is
       passed. The others could be added, I just have not had time. Current
       text fields just have there values printed, they could have boxes drawn
       around them in the future.

       The CSS support in denature only supports the simple items of TD.style
       or .style.

VERSION
       This is denature 0.6.5.
