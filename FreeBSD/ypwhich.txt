YPWHICH(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             YPWHICH(1)

NAME
     ypwhich – return hostname of NIS server of map master

SYNOPSIS
     ypwhich [-d domain] [[-t] -m [mname] | host]
     ypwhich -x

DESCRIPTION
     The ypwhich utility tells which NIS server supplies NIS services to a
     client, or which is the master for a map.  If invoked without arguments,
     it gives the NIS server for the local machine.  If host is specified,
     that machine is queried to find out which NIS server it is using.

     The options are as follows:

     -d domain
             Specify a domain other than the default domain.

     -t      Inhibit translation of map nicknames to their corresponding map
             names.

     -m [mname]
             Find the master NIS server for the named map.  No host may be
             specified with the -m option.  The mname argument can be a map
             name or nickname.  If mname is omitted, ypwhich will produce a
             list of available maps.

     -x      Display the map nickname table.
