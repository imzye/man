POLIPO(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              POLIPO(1)



NAME
       polipo - a caching web proxy

SYNOPSIS
       polipo [ -h | -v | -x ] [ -c config ] [ var=val ]...

DESCRIPTION
       Polipo is a caching HTTP proxy.  It listens to requests for web pages
       from your browser and forwards them to web servers, and forwards the
       servers' replies to your browser.  In the process, it optimises and
       cleans up the network traffic.

       By default, Polipo listens on TCP port 8123.  Please configure your web
       browser to use the proxy on localhost port 8123.

OPTIONS
       -h     Display help and exit.

       -v     Display the list of configuration variables and exit.

       -x     Purge the on-disk cache and exit.

       -c     Select an alternate configuration file.

       var=val
              Change the value of a configuration variable.

FILES
       /usr/local/etc/polipo/config
              The default location of Polipo's configuration file.

       /usr/local/etc/polipo/forbidden
              The default location of the list of forbidden URLs.

       /var/cache/polipo/
              The default location of the on-disk cache.

       /usr/local/share/polipo/www/
              The default root of the local web space.

SIGNALS
       SIGUSR1
              write out all in-memory objects to disk and reload the forbidden
              URLs file.

       SIGUSR2
              write out all in-memory objects to disk, discard all in-memory
              objects, and reload the forbidden URLs file.

       SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGHUP
              write out all in-memory objects to disk and quit.

SECURITY
       The internal web server will follow symbolic links that point outside
       the local document tree.  You should run Polipo in a chroot jail if
       that is a problem.

       There is no reason to run Polipo as root.

FULL DOCUMENTATION
       The full manual for Polipo is maintained in a texinfo file, and is
       normally available through a web server internal to Polipo.  Please
       make sure that Polipo is running, and point your favourite web browser
       at

              http://localhost:8123/

       Alternatively, you may type

              $ info polipo

       at a shell prompt, or

              C-h i m polipo RET

       in Emacs.
