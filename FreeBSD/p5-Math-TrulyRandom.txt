NAME
       TrulyRandom - Perl interface to a truly random number generator
       function

SYNOPSIS
           use Math::TrulyRandom;

           $random = truly_random_value();

DESCRIPTION
       The TrulyRandom module provides an ability to generate truly random
       numbers from within Perl programs.  The source of the randomness is
       from interrupt timing discrepancies.

EXAMPLE
           $random = truly_random_value();

BUGS
       The random numbers take a long time (in computer terms) to generate, so
       are only really useful for seeding pseudo random sequence generators.
