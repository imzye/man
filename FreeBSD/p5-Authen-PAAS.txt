NAME
       Authen::PAAS - Perl Authentication & Authorization Service

SYNOPSIS
         use Authen::PAAS::Context
         use Authen::PAAS::SimpleCallback;
         use Config::Record;

         my $config = Config::Record->new("/etc/myapp.cfg");

         my $context = Authen::PAAS::Context->new($config, "myapp");

         my $callbacks = {
           "username" => Authen::PAAS::SimpleCallback->new("joeblogs"),
           "password" => Authen::PAAS::SimpleCallback->new("123456"),
         };

         my $subject = $context->login($callbacks);

         unless ($subject) {
            die "could not authenticate subject"
         }

         .. do some work using the subject ..

         $context->logout($subject);

DESCRIPTION
       The "Authen::PAAS" distribution provides a Perl API for authenticating
       and authorizing users of computing services. Its design is inspired by
       existing pluggable authentication services such as "PAM" and Java's
       "JAAS", so people familiar with those two services should be
       comfortable with the concepts in "Authen::PAAS". At its heart,
       "Authen::PAAS" provides a login service, with pluggable modules for
       performing different authentication schemes. The pluggable framework
       enables the system  administrator, rather than the application
       developer to define what method is used to authentication with a
       particular application.

       One might ask, why not just use PAM directly via the existing
       Authen::PAM Perl bindings. While this works well for applications which
       wish to authenticate against real UNIX user accounts (eg FTP, Telnet,
       SSH), it is not particularly well suited to applications with
       'virtualized' user accounts. For example, a web application may
       maintain a set of virtual user accounts in a database, or a chat
       server, may maintain a set of user accounts in a text configuration
       file.  Since it merely delegates through to the underlying C libraries,
       the Authen::PAM module does not provide a convenient means to write new
       authentication schemes in Perl. Thus the "Authen::PAAS" distribution
       provides a pure Perl API for authentication.
