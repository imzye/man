NAME
       Graphics::ColorNames::CSS - CSS color names and equivalent RGB values

SYNOPSIS
         require Graphics::ColorNames::CSS;

         $NameTable = Graphics::ColorNames::CSS->NamesRgbTable();
         $RgbBlack  = $NameTable->{black};

DESCRIPTION
       This module defines color names and their associated RGB values from
       the CSS Color Module Level 3 W3C Working Draft of 2008-07-21.

       It is currently an alias for Graphic::ColorNames::WWW. This may change
       in the future. It is recommended to use the WWW module, which will
       always implement a superset of this module.

       See the documentation of Graphics::ColorNames for information how to
       use this module.
