ch(1)                   FreeBSD General Commands Manual                  ch(1)

NAME
       ch - an embeddable C/C++ interpreter

SYNTAX
       ch [-Sacdfghinruw] [argument...]

DESCRIPTION
       Ch language environment is designed to be a superset of C.  It contains
       salient features of many programming languages and programming
       environments.  Ch is interpretive with a quick system response for
       information integration throughout entire organizations.  It can be
       used for numerical computing, Unix/Windows shell programming, common
       gateway interface (CGI), internet computing, real-time control of
       mechatronic systems, and many other applications.

       The documentation for Ch is large and not well suited to the 'man' page
       format.  The most updated documentations are available on the Web at
       http://www.softintegration.com.

OPTIONS
       -S        Safe shell. All restrictions of C shell apply to the safe
                 shell.  Pointer cannot be used as an lvalue and many built-in
                 functions such as remove(), rename(), unlink(), open(), and
                 fopen() are disabled after execution of $CHHOME/config/chsrc
                 and $CHHOME/config/chslogin in case of login shell.

       -a        Portable code.  Platform-dependent functions in
                 CHHOME/lib/libopt cannot be used.

       -c        Read commands from the first filename argument (which must be
                 present).  Remaining arguments are placed in argv or _argv,
                 the argument-list variable, and passed directly to ch.

       -d        When ch is started, it first checks if file .chrc exists in
                 user's home directory. If not, Ch will copy
                 $CHHOME/config/.chrc to user's home directory.  When chs is
                 started, it first checks if file .chsrc exists in user's home
                 directory. If not, Ch will copy $CHHOME/config/.chsrc to
                 user's home directory.  In Windows,  startup files _chrc and
                 _chsrc instead of .chrc and .chsrc,  will be used for regular
                 Ch and safe Ch, respectively.

       -f        Fast start.  Read neither the chrc and .chrc files, nor the
                 chlogin and .chlogin files (if a login shell) upon startup.

       -g        For CGI script debug. It turns the web browser into text
                 shell.

       -h        Display Ch usage message for help.

       -i        Reserved for forced interactive shell (ignored).

       -n        Parse (interpret), but do not  execute  commands.  This
                 option can be used to check Ch shell scripts for syntax
                 errors.  The _warning flag will be set to the highest level.
                 All warning messages will be printed out.  Start up files
                 will be parsed only without execution.

       -r        Redirect stderr stream to stdout. This option is useful for
                 debugging programs running in Windows operating systems.  For
                 example, command

                      ch -r chcmd > junkfile

                 will send error messages from stderr stream in program chcmd
                 to file junkfile

       -u        Unbuffer the stdout stream mainly for handling I/O in IDE.

       -v        Print out Ch edition and version number in the stdout stream.

       -w        The _warning flag will be set to the highest level for both
                 parsing and execution of the program.  All warning messages
                 will be printed out.
