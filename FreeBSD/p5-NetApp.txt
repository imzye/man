NAME
       NetApp::Aggregate -- OO class for creating and managing NetApp filer
       aggregates

SYNOPSIS
           use NetApp::Filer;
           use NetApp::Aggregate;

           my $filer = NetApp::Filer->new({ .... });

           my @aggregate_names = $filer->get_aggregate_names;

           my @aggregates      = $filer->get_aggregates;

           my $aggregate       = $filer->get_aggregate( 'aggr01' );

DESCRIPTION
       This class encapsulates a single NetApp filer aggregate, and provides
       methods for querying information about the aggregate and it's sub-
       objects (eg. volumes), as well as methods for managing the aggregate
       itself.

INSTANCE METHODS
   General Instance Methods
       get_filer

       Returns the NetApp::Filer object representing the filer on which the
       aggregate exists.

       get_name

       Returns the name of the aggregate as a string.

       get_states, get_statuses, get_options

       Each of these methods returns a list of strings, each of which
       represents a single state, status, or option for the aggregate.

           NOTE: All you English grammar pluralization rules fanatics can
           give up trying to convince the author to call that one method
           get_stati.

       get_state( $state ), get_status( $status ), get_option( $option )

       Each of these methods returns the value for the specified state, status
       or option.  If that particular key wasn't present, then this method
       will return undef.  This makes it easy to tell the difference between a
       key that doesn't exist, and one that has a false value.

       get_plex

       Returns the NetApp::Aggregate::Plex object representing the plex on
       which the aggregate lives.

   Volume Specific Methods
       get_volume_names

       Returns a list of the volume names which are contained within this
       aggregate.

       get_volumes

       Returns a list of NetApp::Volume objects, each of which represents one
       of the volumes in the aggregate.

       get_volume( $name )

       Returns a single NetApp::Volume object representing the specified
       volume.  If that volume doesn't exist on the aggregate, then a fatal
       exception is raised.

       create_volume( %args )

       This method creates a flexible volume in the aggregate, and returns the
       NetApp::Volume object representing the new volume.  The arguments are
       as follows.  All values are simple strings, unless otherwise noted.

           $aggregate->create_volume(
               # Required arguments
               name            => $name,
               size            => $size,
               # Optional arguments
               space           => 'none' | 'file' | 'volume',
               language        => $language,
               source_filer    => $source_filer,
               source_volume   => $source_volume,
           );

       Both the source_filer and source_volume arguments must be given when
       creating a flexcache volume.

       The space and language arguments may not be specified with the
       source_filer/source_volume arguments.

       destroy_volume( %args )

       Destroys the specified volume.  Note that since this API is not
       designed to be used interactively, the -f (force) argument is always
       used.  Be sure you really want to destroy the volume, programatically.

           $aggregate->destroy_volume(
               # Required argument
               name            => $name,
           );

       The $name must be a string, and it must be one of the volumes in the
       $aggregate.

   Qtree Specific Methods
       get_qtree_names

       Returns a list of strings, each of which is the name of a qtree on the
       aggregate.

       get_qtrees

       Returns a list of NetApp::Qtree objects, each of which represents a
       single qtree on the aggregate.

       get_qtree( $name )

       Returns a single NetApp::Qtree object for the specified qtree name. The
       name must in the form of a pathname, for example:

           /vol/volume_name/qtree_name

       The qtree_name is optional if querying the object for a volume's qtree.
       This method simply returns nothing if the specified qtree doesn't exist
       on the aggregate.

   Snapshot Specific Methods
       get_snapshots

       Returns a list of NetApp::Snapshot objects for each of the snapshots of
       the aggregate.

       get_snapshot( $name )

       Returns a single NetApp::Snapshot object matching the specified name,
       if it exists for the aggregate.

       create_snapshot( $name )

       Creates a snapshot of the aggregate with the specified name.

       delete_snapshot( $name )

       Deletes a snapshot of the aggregate with the specified name.

       get_snapshot_deltas

       Returns a list of NetApp::Snapshot::Delta objects for each snapshot
       delta for the aggregate.

       get_snapshot_reserved

       Returns a string representing the amount of reserved space, as a
       percentage.  This string does NOT include the % sign.

       set_snapshot_reserved( $percentage )

       Sets the snapshot reserved space to the specified percentage, which
       should also NOT include the % sign.

       get_snapshot_schedule

       Returns a NetApp::Snapshot::Schedule object representing the snapshot
       schedule for the aggregate.

       set_snapshot_schedule( %args )

       Sets the snapshot schedule for the aggregate based on the arguments
       passed.  The argument syntax is:

           $aggregate->set_snapshot_schedule(
               weekly          => $weekly,
               daily           => $daily,
               hourly          => $hourly,
               hourlist        => [
                   $hour1, $hour2, $hour3, ....
               ],
           );

TO BE IMPLEMENTED
       NOTE: Currently, all of the following methods have yet to be
       implemented, but will be soon.  This documentation serves as a
       guideline for how to implement the perl API for each associates CLI
       function.

   NetApp::Aggregate->create( ... )
           my $aggregate       = NetApp::Aggregate->create(
               # Required arguments
               filer           => $filer,      # NetApp::Filer object
               name            => $aggregate_name,
               # Required but mutually exclusive arguments
               # Either 'disks' OR 'diskcount and/or disksize'
               disks           => [
                                    [ $disk1, $disk2, .... ],
                                    [ $diskn, $diskn+1, .... ],
                                  ],
               diskcount       => $diskcount,
               disksize        => $disksize,
               # Optional arguments
               raidtype        => 'raid0' | 'raid4' | 'raid-dp',
               raidsize        => $raidsize,
               disktype        => 'ATA' | 'FCAL' | 'LUN' | 'SAS' | 'SATA' | 'SCSI',
               rpm             => $rpm,
               mirrored        => $boolean,
           );

   $aggregate->add( ... )
           $aggregate->add(
               # Required arguments
               name            => $aggregate_name,
               # Required but mutually exclusive arguments
               # Either 'disks' OR 'diskcount and/or disksize'
               disks           => [
                                    [ $disk1, $disk2, .... ],
                                    [ $diskn, $diskn+1, .... ],
                                  ],
               diskcount       => $diskcount,
               disksize        => $disksize,
               # Optional arguments
               raidgroup       => $raidgroup,
               force           => 1,
           );

   $aggregate->destroy()
       NOTE: This always uses the -force option, since this API is not
       interactive.

   $aggregate->offline()
           $aggregate->offline(
               # Optional arguments
               cifsdelaytime   => $cifsdelaytime,
           );

   $aggregate->online()
       NOTE: It is unclear whether or not we should always imply -f (force =>
       1), or whether we should treat the prompted scenario as an error, and
       raise an exception.  Since forcing an aggregate online can result in
       data loss when -f is used, perhaps we should force that state to be
       cleaned up first.

   $aggregate->rename( $newname )
   $aggregate->restrict( ... )
           $aggregate->restrict(
               # Optional arguments
               cifsdelaytime   => $cifsdelaytime,
           );
