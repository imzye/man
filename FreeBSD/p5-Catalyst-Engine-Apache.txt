Catalyst::Engine::Apache(3)                User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Catalyst::Engine::Apache - Catalyst Apache Engines

SYNOPSIS
       For example Apache configurations, see the documentation for the engine
       that corresponds to your Apache version.

       "Catalyst::Engine::Apache::MP13"  - mod_perl 1.3x

       "Catalyst::Engine::Apache2::MP19" - mod_perl 1.99x

       "Catalyst::Engine::Apache2::MP20" - mod_perl 2.x

DESCRIPTION
       These classes provide mod_perl support for Catalyst.

METHODS
   $c->engine->apache
       Returns an "Apache", "Apache::RequestRec" or "Apache2::RequestRec"
       object, depending on your mod_perl version.  This method is also
       available as $c->apache.

   $c->engine->return
       If you need to return something other than OK from the mod_perl
       handler, you may set any other Apache constant in this method.  You
       should only use this method if you know what you are doing or bad
       things may happen!  For example, to return DECLINED in mod_perl 2:

           use Apache2::Const -compile => qw(DECLINED);
           $c->engine->return( Apache2::Const::DECLINED );

   NOTES ABOUT LOCATIONMATCH
       The Apache engine tries to figure out the correct base path if your app
       is running within a LocationMatch block.  For example:

           <LocationMatch ^/match/(this|that)*>
               SetHandler          modperl
               PerlResponseHandler MyApp
           </LocationMatch>

       This will correctly set the base path to '/match/this/' or
       '/match/that/' depending on which path was used for the request.

       In some cases this may not be what you want, so you can disable this
       behavior by adding this to your configuration:

           PerlSetVar CatalystDisableLocationMatch 1

   NOTES ON NON-STANDARD PORTS
       If you wish to run your site on a non-standard port you will need to
       use the "Port" Apache config rather than "Listen". This will result in
       the correct port being added to urls created using "uri_for".

           Port 8080
