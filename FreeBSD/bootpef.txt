BOOTPEF(8)              FreeBSD System Manager's Manual             BOOTPEF(8)

NAME
     bootpef – BOOTP Extension File compiler

SYNOPSIS
     bootpef [-c chdir-path] [-d debug-level] [-f config-file]
             [client-name ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The bootpef utility builds the Extension Path files described by RFC 1497
     (tag 18).  If any client-name arguments are specified, then bootpef
     compiles the extension files for only those clients.

OPTIONS
     -c chdir-path
             Sets the current directory used by bootpef while creating
             extension files.  This is useful when the extension file names
             are specified as relative pathnames, and bootpef needs to use the
             same current directory as the TFTP server (typically /tftpboot).

     -d debug-level
             Sets the debug-level variable that controls the amount of
             debugging messages generated.  For example, -d 4 will set the
             debugging level to 4.

     -f config-file
             Set the name of the config file that specifies the option data to
             be sent to each client.
