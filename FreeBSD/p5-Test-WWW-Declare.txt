NAME
       Test::WWW::Declare - declarative testing for your web app

SYNOPSIS
           use Test::WWW::Declare tests => 3;
           use Your::Web::App::Test;

           Your::Web::App::Test->start_server;

           session 'testuser' => run {
               flow 'log in and out' => check {
                   flow 'log in' => check {
                       get 'http://localhost/';
                       fill form 'login' => {
                           username => 'testuser',
                           password => 'drowssap',
                       };
                       content should contain 'log out';
                   };

                   flow 'log out' => check {
                       get 'http://localhost/';
                       click href 'log out';
                   };
               };
           };

DESCRIPTION
       Often in web apps, tests are very dependent on the state set up by
       previous tests. If one test fails (e.g. "follow the link to the admin
       page") then it's likely there will be many more failures. This module
       aims to alleviate this problem, as well as provide a nicer interface to
       Test::WWW::Mechanize.

       The central idea is that of "flow". Each flow is a sequence of commands
       ("fill in this form") and assertions ("content should contain
       'testuser'"). If any of these commands or assertions fail then the flow
       is aborted. Only that one failure is reported to the test harness and
       user. Flows may also contain other flows. If an inner flow fails, then
       the outer flow fails as well.

FLOWS AND SESSIONS
   session NAME => run { CODE }
       Sessions are a way of associating a set of flows with a WWW::Mechanize
       instance. A session is mostly equivalent with a user interacting with
       your web app.

       Within a session, every command ("get", "click link", etc) is operating
       on that session's WWW::Mechanize instance. You may have multiple
       sessions in one test file. Two sessions with the same name are in fact
       the same session.  This lets you write code like the following,
       simplified slightly:

           session 'first user' => run {
               get "$URL/give?task=1&victim=other";
               session 'other user' => run {
                   get "$URL/tasks";
                   content should match qr/task 1/;

                   # this is the same session/mech as the outermost 'first user'
                   session 'first user' => run {
                       get "$URL/tasks";
                       content shouldnt match qr/task 1/;
                   };
               };
           };

   flow NAME => check { CODE }
       A flow encompasses a single test. As described above, each flow is a
       sequence of commands, assertions, and other flows. If any of the
       components of a flow fail, the rest of the flow is aborted and one or
       more test failures are reported to the test harness.

COMMANDS
   get URL
   click button
   click href
   follow_link
   fill form NAME => {FIELD1 => VALUE1, FIELD2 => VALUE2}

ASSERTIONS
       Every assertion has two parts: a subject and a verb.

   SUBJECTS
       content

       title

       url

   VERBS
       should(nt) (caselessly) match REGEX

       should(nt) (caselessly) contain STRING

       should(nt) (caselessly) lack STRING

       should(nt) (caselessly) equal STRING

SUBCLASSING
       One of the goals of this module is to let you subclass it to provide
       extra features, such as automatically logging in a user each time a
       session is created.

CAVEATS
       If you fail any tests, then the actual number of tests run may be fewer
       than you have in your file. This is because when a flow fails, it
       immediately aborts the rest of its body (which may include other
       flows). So if you're setting the number of tests based on how many ran,
       make sure that all tests passed.

BUGS
       Hopefully few. We'd like to know about any of them. Please report them
       to "bug-test-www-declare@rt.cpan.org".
