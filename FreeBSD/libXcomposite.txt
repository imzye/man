DESCRIPTION
       The composite extension provides several related mechanisms:

       Per-hierarchy storage
           The rendering of an entire hierarchy of windows is redirected to
           off-screen storage. The pixels of that hierarchy are available
           whenever it is viewable. Storage is automatically reallocated when
           the top level window changes size. Contents beyond the geometry of
           the top window are not preserved.

       Automatic shadow update
           When a hierarchy is rendered off-screen, the X server provides an
           automatic mechanism for presenting those contents within the parent
           window. The implementation is free to make this update lag behind
           actual rendering operations by an unspecified amount of time. This
           automatic update mechanism may be disabled so that the parent
           window contents can be completely determined by an external
           application.

       Composite Overlay Window
           Version 0.3 of the protocol adds the Composite Overlay Window,
           which provides compositing managers with a surface on which to draw
           without interference. This window is always above normal windows
           and is always below the screen saver window. It is an InputOutput
           window whose width and height are the screen dimensions. Its visual
           is the root visual and its border width is zero. Attempts to
           redirect it using the composite extension are ignored. This window
           does not appear in the reply of the QueryTree request. It is also
           an override redirect window. These last two features make it
           invisible to window managers and other X11 clients. The only way to
           access the XID of this window is via the CompositeGetOverlayWindow
           request. Initially, the Composite Overlay Window is unmapped.

       Parent window clipping
           Version 0.4 of the protocol modifies the semantics of parent window
           clipping in the presence of manual redirected children. With this
           version, the area in the parent covered by manual redirected
           children is left in the parent clip list instead of being removed
           as in older versions.

       Per-hierarchy storage may be created for individual windows or for all
       children of a window. Manual shadow update may be selected by only a
       single application for each window; manual update may also be selected
       on a per-window basis or for each child of a window. Detecting when to
       update may be done with the Damage extension.

       The off-screen storage includes the window contents, its borders and
       the contents of all descendants.

ARGUMENTS
       display
           Pointer to the Display structure returned from XOpenDisplay for the
           connection to the X server.

       event_base_return
           Pointer to integer where the base value for Composite Extension
           events will be stored.

       error_base_return
           Pointer to integer where the base value for Composite Extension
           errors will be stored.

       major_version_return
           Pointer to integer where the major version of the Composite
           Extension supported by the X server will be stored.

       minor_version_return
           Pointer to integer where the minor version of the Composite
           Extension supported by the X server will be stored.

       window
           Specifies the window ID to operate on.

       update
           Specifies the mode for updating the window contents. Must be either
           CompositeRedirectAutomatic or CompositeRedirectManual.

FUNCTIONS
       XCompositeQueryExtension

           XCompositeQueryExtension determines if the Composite Extension is
           available on the given display. It returns True if the extension is
           supported, otherwise False. If the extension is present, the base
           values for events and errors are returned, and can be used to
           decode incoming event and error values.

       XCompositeQueryVersion

           XCompositeQueryVersion determines if the X Server supports a
           version of the X Composite Extension which is compatible with the
           client library. A non-zero Status is returned if a compatible
           version of the extension is supported, otherwise a zero Status is
           returned. If the extension is supported, the major and minor
           version numbers are returned to indicate the level of Composite
           Extension support. No other XComposite functions (except
           XCompositeQueryExtension) may be called before this function. If a
           client violates this rule, the effects of all subsequent XComposite
           calls that it makes are undefined.

       XCompositeVersion

           XCompositeVersion returns the version of the X Composite library.
           The version number is encoded as: (major * 10000) + (minor * 100) +
           revision

           For example, version 1.4.6 would be encoded as the integer 10406.

       XCompositeRedirectWindow

           XCompositeRedirectWindow requests the X server to direct the
           hierarchy starting at window to off-screen storage. The update
           argument specifies whether the contents are mirrored to the parent
           window automatically or not. Only one client at a time may specify
           an update type of CompositeRedirectManual, another attempt will
           result in a BadAccess error. When all clients enabling redirection
           terminate, the redirection will automatically be disabled.

           The root window may not be redirected. Doing so results in a
           BadMatch error. Specifying an invalid window id will result in a
           BadWindow error.

       XCompositeRedirectSubwindows

           XCompositeRedirectSubwindows requests the X server to redirect
           hierarchies starting at all current and future children of window
           as in XCompositeRedirectWindow. If update is
           CompositeRedirectManual, then painting of the window background
           during window manipulation and ClearArea requests is inhibited.

       XCompositeUnredirectWindow

           XCompositeUnredirectWindow requests the X server to terminate
           redirection of window. If the specified window was not selected for
           redirection by the current client, a BadValue error results.

       XCompositeUnredirectSubwindows

           XCompositeUnredirectWindow requests the X server to terminate
           redirection of all children of window. If the specified window was
           not selected for sub-redirection by the current client, a BadValue
           error results.

       XCompositeCreateRegionFromBorderClip

           XCompositeCreateRegionFromBorderClip creates a region containing
           the "usual" border clip value; that is the area of the window
           clipped against siblings and the parent. This region can be used to
           restrict rendering to suitable areas while updating only a single
           window. The region is copied at the moment the request is executed;
           future changes to the window hierarchy will not be reflected in
           this region.

       XCompositeNameWindowPixmap

           XCompositeNameWindowPixmap creates and returns a pixmap id that
           serves as a reference to the off-screen storage for window. This
           pixmap will remain allocated until freed, even if the window is
           unmapped, reconfigured or destroyed. However, the window will get a
           new pixmap allocated each time it is mapped or resized, so this
           function will need to be reinvoked for the client to continue to
           refer to the storage holding the current window contents. Generates
           a BadMatch error if window is not redirected or is not visible.

           The X server must support at least version 0.2 of the Composite
           Extension for XCompositeNameWindowPixmap.

       XCompositeGetOverlayWindow

           XCompositeGetOverlayWindow returns the window ID of the Composite
           Overlay Window for the screen specified by the argument window.
           This function notifies the X server that the client wishes to use
           the Composite Overlay Window of this screen. If this Composite
           Overlay Window has not yet been mapped, it is mapped by this
           request.

           The Composite Overlay Window for a particular screen will be
           unmapped when all clients who have called this function have either
           called XCompositeReleaseOverlayWindow for that screen, or
           terminated their connection to the X server.

           The X server must support at least version 0.3 of the Composite
           Extension for XCompositeGetOverlayWindow.

       XCompositeReleaseOverlayWindow
           This request specifies that the client is no longer using the
           Composite Overlay Window on the screen specified by the argument
           window. A screen's Composite Overlay Window is unmapped when there
           are no longer any clients using it.

           The X server must support at least version 0.3 of the Composite
           Extension for XCompositeReleaseOverlayWindow.
