WIDENTD(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             WIDENTD(1)

WIDENTD
     widentd – answers on the auth(113) port according to rfc 1413 with a
     fixed reply.

SYNOPSIS
     widentd [-v] [-u -userid] [-o -system-name] [-s -service] [-i -address]

DESCRIPTION
     The widentd deamon listens on either the specified address or on all
     interface addresses on that always replies with default reply. Use the -i
     flag to specify a diffrent address to bind to; and use the -s flag to
     sepcify another port.

     All errors are sent to syslog unless the -v flag is set. In which case,
     the deamon will not fork, and will print verbosely on stdout. Errors go
     to stderr.

     The username returned can be set with the -u flag; although rfc 1413
     allows for a wide range of characters, and charsets, this applications is
     restricted to just the normal A-Z, a-z, '.', '-' and '@' range; as some
     broken IRC servers barf on anything more complex. The default is
     'beastie', in honour of the BSD Daemon https://www.freebsd.org/art/

     Likewise th -o flag sets the operating system; the default is OTHER.
     Possible values are UNIX, or one of the SYSTEM NAMES as registered with
     IANA (See rfc1340 or one it's successors).

BUGS
     This deamon is propably not very compliant with RFC 1413; it ignores
     charsets, it quite intentionally lies, and so on. Fixes appreciated.  Pp
