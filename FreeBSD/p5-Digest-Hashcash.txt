NAME
       Digest::Hashcash - generate Hashcash stamps (http://www.hashcash.org)

SYNOPSIS
        use Digest::Hashcash;

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements the hashcash hash (or digest, although it's not
       clearly a digest). For all your information needs please visit
       http://www.hashcash.org.

       One thing to note about this module is that it requires ISO C99
       support, both in your compiler and your standard library.  If you don't
       have a compiler that supports ISO C, get gcc at http://gcc.gnu.org/ :)

       $secs = estimate_time $size
           Estimate the average time necessary to calculate a token of the
           given size.

           See also "estimate_size".

       $size = estimate_size $time[, $min]
           Estimate the size that can be calculated in the given time (which
           is an upper bound). The function will not return a size less then
           "min".

           Estimating the time to be used can go wrong by as much as 50% (but
           is usually quite accurate), and the estimation itself can take as
           much as a second on slower (<pentium) machines, but faster machines
           (1Ghz P3 for example) usually handle it within a hundredth of a
           second or so.

           The estimation will be done only once, so you can call this
           fucntion as often as you like without incuring the overhead
           everytime.

       $cipher = new Digest::Hashcash [param => value...]
           size => 20
               The number of collisions, in bits. Every bit increases the time
               to create the token (and thus the cash) by two.

           vers => 1
               Default version 1.  Can produce version 0 if required for
               backwards compatibility.

           uid => ""
               A string used to make the token more unique (e.g. the senders
               address) and reduce token collisions. The string must only
               contain characters valid for the trial part of the token, e.g.
               uuencoded, base64 or e-mail-address-parts are useful here.
               Deprecated: use extension field if required.

           extrarand => 0
               The extra bytes of randomness to add to the token in addition
               to the standard amount. Each byte adds a little bit over 6 bit
               of randomness to the token.

               The standard amount of randomness is 8 (> 51 bits of
               randomness).

           timestamp => 0
               The timestamp to use. A value of 0 (the default) means to use
               the current time.

       $token = $cipher->hash ($data [, param => value...])
           Creates and returns a new token. This can take some time.

           Any additional parameters are interpreted the same way as arguments
           to "new".

       $prefix = $cipher->verify ($token)
           Version 0: Checks the given token and returns the number of
           collision bits.

           Version 1: Returns 0 if stated value is more than the computed
           collision value, otherwise returns the stated stamp value.

           Any additional parameters are interpreted the same way as arguments
           to "new".

       $version = $cipher->version ($token)
           Returns the version of the stamp (currently 0 or 1).

       $resource = $cipher->resource ($token)
           Returns the resource part, or "undef".

       $tstamp = $cipher->timestamp ($token)
           Returns the timestamp part (in the same format as perls "time"), or
           "undef".

       $extension = $cipher->extension ($token [,$name [,$var]])
           For Version 1 stamps returns the extension part; for Version 0
           stamps returns undef.  In a scalar context returns the extension
           string, in array context returns associative array containing
           extensions as keys and their values as the corresponding value.  If
           the optional name argument is given, returns info but about that
           extension (ie decodes the options of that extension if called in
           array context); finally if the optional var argument also is given
           reports just the (scalar) value of that variable in the named
           extension.

           Note it is valid for an extension to exist (the key exists in the
           associative array) but to have undefined value, this corresponds to
           a boolean option without a value.  Like "noreply;foo=bar" has two
           extensions, noreply and foo; noreply has no associated value, so
           the method extension would parse such a stamp into an associative
           array containing key "noreply" with an undefined value; and key
           "foo" containing associated value "bar".

BUGS
        * There is a y2k+100 problem, as I always assume the same as
          Time::Local.  This is a problem with the hashcash specification,
          which specifies years as 2 digits :( Though it hardly matters --
          after 100 years of Moore's law a 20 bit stamp will be tiny and not
          worth storing.

        * extension method could be more efficient (it does not cache its
          parsed results so if used in a loop reparses on each call)
