SURICATA(1)                        Suricata                        SURICATA(1)

NAME
       suricata - Suricata

SYNOPSIS
       suricata [OPTIONS] [BPF FILTER]

DESCRIPTION
       suricata is a high performance Network IDS, IPS and Network Security
       Monitoring engine. Open Source and owned by a community run non-profit
       foundation, the Open Information Security Foundation (OISF).

       suricata can be used to analyze live traffic and pcap files. It can
       generate alerts based on rules. suricata will generate traffic logs.

       When used with live traffic suricata can be passive or active. Active
       modes are: inline in a L2 bridge setup, inline with L3 integration with
       host firewall (NFQ, IPFW, WinDivert), or out of band using active
       responses.

OPTIONS

       -h     Display a brief usage overview.

       -V     Displays the version of Suricata.

       -c <path>
              Path to configuration file.

       --include <path>
              Additional configuration files to include. Multiple additional
              configuration files can be provided and will be included in the
              order specified on the command line.  These additional
              configuration files are loaded as if they existed at the end of
              the main configuration file.

              Example including one additional file:

                 --include /etc/suricata/other.yaml

              Example including more than one additional file:

                 --include /etc/suricata/other.yaml --include /etc/suricata/extra.yaml

       -T     Test configuration.

       -v     Increase the verbosity of the Suricata application logging by
              increasing the log level from the default. This option can be
              passed multiple times to further increase the verbosity.

              • -v: INFO

              • -vv: PERF

              • -vvv: CONFIG

              • -vvvv: DEBUG

              This option will not decrease the log level set in the
              configuration file if it is already more verbose than the level
              requested with this option.

       -r <path>
              Run in pcap offline mode (replay mode) reading files from pcap
              file. If <path> specifies a directory, all files in that
              directory will be processed in order of modified time
              maintaining flow state between files.

       --pcap-file-continuous
              Used with the -r option to indicate that the mode should stay
              alive until interrupted. This is useful with directories to add
              new files and not reset flow state between files.

       --pcap-file-recursive
              Used with the -r option when the path provided is a directory.
              This option enables recursive traversal into subdirectories to a
              maximum depth of 255.  This option cannot be combined with
              --pcap-file-continuous.  Symlinks are ignored.

       --pcap-file-delete
              Used with the -r option to indicate that the mode should delete
              pcap files after they have been processed. This is useful with
              pcap-file-continuous to continuously feed files to a directory
              and have them cleaned up when done. If this option is not set,
              pcap files will not be deleted after processing.

       -i <interface>
              After the -i option you can enter the interface card you would
              like to use to sniff packets from.  This option will try to use
              the best capture method available. Can be used several times to
              sniff packets from several interfaces.

       --pcap[=<device>]
              Run in PCAP mode. If no device is provided the interfaces
              provided in the pcap section of the configuration file will be
              used.

       --af-packet[=<device>]
              Enable capture of packet using AF_PACKET on Linux. If no device
              is supplied, the list of devices from the af-packet section in
              the yaml is used.

       --af-xdp[=<device>]
              Enable capture of packet using AF_XDP on Linux. If no device is
              supplied, the list of devices from the af-xdp section in the
              yaml is used.

       -q <queue id>
              Run inline of the NFQUEUE queue ID provided. May be provided
              multiple times.

       -s <filename.rules>
              With the -s option you can set a file with signatures, which
              will be loaded together with the rules set in the yaml.

              It is possible to use globbing when specifying rules files.  For
              example, -s '/path/to/rules/*.rules'

       -S <filename.rules>
              With the -S option you can set a file with signatures, which
              will be loaded exclusively, regardless of the rules set in the
              yaml.

              It is possible to use globbing when specifying rules files.  For
              example, -S '/path/to/rules/*.rules'

       -l <directory>
              With the -l option you can set the default log directory. If you
              already have the default-log-dir set in yaml, it will not be
              used by Suricata if you use the -l option. It will use the log
              dir that is set with the -l option. If you do not set a
              directory with the -l option, Suricata will use the directory
              that is set in yaml.

       -D     Normally if you run Suricata on your console, it keeps your
              console occupied. You can not use it for other purposes, and
              when you close the window, Suricata stops running.  If you run
              Suricata as daemon (using the -D option), it runs at the
              background and you will be able to use the console for other
              tasks without disturbing the engine running.

       --runmode <runmode>
              With the --runmode option you can set the runmode that you would
              like to use. This command line option can override the yaml
              runmode option.

              Runmodes are: workers, autofp and single.

              For more information about runmodes see Runmodes in the user
              guide.

       -F <bpf filter file>
              Use BPF filter from file.

       -k [all|none]
              Force (all) the checksum check or disable (none) all checksum
              checks.

       --user=<user>
              Set the process user after initialization. Overrides the user
              provided in the run-as section of the configuration file.

       --group=<group>
              Set the process group to group after initialization. Overrides
              the group provided in the run-as section of the configuration
              file.

       --pidfile <file>
              Write the process ID to file. Overrides the pid-file option in
              the configuration file and forces the file to be written when
              not running as a daemon.

       --init-errors-fatal
              Exit with a failure when errors are encountered loading
              signatures.

       --strict-rule-keywords[=all|<keyword>|<keywords(csv)]
              Applies to: classtype, reference and app-layer-event.

              By default missing reference or classtype values are warnings
              and not errors. Additionally, loading outdated app-layer-event
              events are also not treated as errors, but as warnings instead.

              If this option is enabled these warnings are considered errors.

              If no value, or the value 'all', is specified, the option
              applies to all of the keywords above. Alternatively, a comma
              separated list can be supplied with the keyword names it should
              apply to.

       --disable-detection
              Disable the detection engine.

       --disable-hashing
              Disable support for hash algorithms such as md5, sha1 and
              sha256.

              By default hashing is enabled. Disabling hashing will also
              disable some Suricata features such as the filestore, ja3, and
              rule keywords that use hash algorithms.

       --dump-config
              Dump the configuration loaded from the configuration file to the
              terminal and exit.

       --dump-features
              Dump the features provided by Suricata modules and exit.
              Features list (a subset of) the configuration values and are
              intended to assist with comparing provided features with those
              required by one or more rules.

       --build-info
              Display the build information the Suricata was built with.

       --list-app-layer-protos
              List all supported application layer protocols.

       --list-keywords=[all|csv|<kword>]
              List all supported rule keywords.

       --list-runmodes
              List all supported run modes.

       --set <key>=<value>
              Set a configuration value. Useful for overriding basic
              configuration parameters. For example, to change the default log
              directory:

                 --set default-log-dir=/var/tmp

              This option cannot be used to add new entries to a list in the
              configuration file, such as a new output. It can only be used to
              modify a value in a list that already exists.

              For example, to disable the eve-log in the default configuration
              file:

                 --set outputs.1.eve-log.enabled=no

              Also note that the index values may change as the suricata.yaml
              is updated.

              See the output of --dump-config for existing values that could
              be modified with their index.

       --engine-analysis
              Print reports on analysis of different sections in the engine
              and exit. Please have a look at the conf parameter
              engine-analysis on what reports can be printed

       --unix-socket=<file>
              Use file as the Suricata unix control socket. Overrides the
              filename provided in the unix-command section of the
              configuration file.

       --reject-dev=<device>
              Use device to send out RST / ICMP error packets with the reject
              keyword.

       --pcap-buffer-size=<size>
              Set the size of the PCAP buffer (0 - 2147483647).

       --netmap[=<device>]
              Enable capture of packet using NETMAP on FreeBSD or Linux. If no
              device is supplied, the list of devices from the netmap section
              in the yaml is used.

       --pfring[=<device>]
              Enable PF_RING packet capture. If no device provided, the
              devices in the Suricata configuration will be used.

       --pfring-cluster-id <id>
              Set the PF_RING cluster ID.

       --pfring-cluster-type <type>
              Set the PF_RING cluster type (cluster_round_robin,
              cluster_flow).

       -d <divert-port>
              Run inline using IPFW divert mode.

       --dag <device>
              Enable packet capture off a DAG card. If capturing off a
              specific stream the stream can be select using a device name
              like "dag0:4". This option may be provided multiple times read
              off multiple devices and/or streams.

       --napatech
              Enable packet capture using the Napatech Streams API.

       --erf-in=<file>
              Run in offline mode reading the specific ERF file (Endace
              extensible record format).

       --simulate-ips
              Simulate IPS mode when running in a non-IPS mode.

OPTIONS FOR DEVELOPERS

       -u     Run the unit tests and exit. Requires that Suricata be
              configured with --enable-unittests.

       -U, --unittest-filter=REGEX
              With the -U option you can select which of the unit tests you
              want to run. This option uses REGEX. Example of use: suricata -u
              -U http

       --list-unittests
              Lists available unit tests.

       --fatal-unittests
              Enables fatal failure on a unit test error. Suricata will exit
              instead of continuing more tests.

       --unittests-coverage
              Display unit test coverage report.

SIGNALS
       Suricata will respond to the following signals:

       SIGUSR2
          Causes Suricata to perform a live rule reload.

       SIGHUP
          Causes Suricata to close and re-open all log files. This can be used
          to re-open log files after they may have been moved away by log
          rotation utilities.

FILES AND DIRECTORIES

       /usr/local/etc/suricata/suricata.yaml
              Default location of the Suricata configuration file.

       /usr/local/var/log/suricata
              Default Suricata log directory.

EXAMPLES
       To capture live traffic from interface eno1:

          suricata -i eno1

       To analyze a pcap file and output logs to the CWD:

          suricata -r /path/to/capture.pcap

       To capture using AF_PACKET and override the flow memcap setting from
       the suricata.yaml:

          suricata --af-packet --set flow.memcap=1gb

       To analyze a pcap file with a custom rule file:
