ABCSELECT(1)            FreeBSD General Commands Manual           ABCSELECT(1)

NAME
       abcselect - manipulates music in abc format

SYNOPSIS
       abcselect [-?] [-X xrefs] [-V voices] [-P parts] [-Q movements] [-c]
       [infile]

DESCRIPTION
       abcselect reads an input file containing music in abc format and
       outputs a modified version in abc format.

       The output is written to stdout and can be piped directly into
       abctab2ps. If no input file is given, the input is read from stdin.

       All numbers specified in the options refer to the cardinal number of
       the corresponding info field, not to the actual value of the info
       field. E.g. the first tune is always specified with "-X 1", regardless
       of the value in the "X:" field.

OPTIONS
       -?     print usage message

       -X xrefs
              print only tunes specified by xrefs. xrefs must be a comma
              separated list of tune numbers or ranges, eg. "-X 1-3,6". When
              omitted, all tunes are printed.

       -V voices
              select specified voices. voices must be a comma separated list
              of voice numbers or ranges, eg. "-V 1-3,6". When omitted, all
              voices are printed.

       -P parts
              select specified parts. parts must be a comma separated list of
              numbers or ranges, eg. "-P 1-3,6". When omitted, all parts are
              printed.

       -Q movements
              select specified movements (tempo indications). movements must
              be a comma separated list of numbers or ranges, eg. "-Q 1-3,6".
              When omitted, all movements are printed.

       -c     keep comments of all voices. This can be useful if comments
              contain barnumbers or text that would otherwise be suppressed.

EXAMPLES
       Select first and third voice from second movement of sample.abc and
       typeset it with abctab2ps:

            abcselect -V 1,3 -Q 2 sample.abc | abctab2ps

       Select first, second and third voice from second tune of sample.abc and
       print it to selection.abc:

            abcselect -V 1-3 -X 2 sample.abc > selection.abc
