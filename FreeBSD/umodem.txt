UMODEM(4)              FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual              UMODEM(4)

NAME
     umodem – USB Communication Device Class serial (CDC ACM) driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device usb
           device ucom
           device umodem

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           umodem_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The umodem driver provides support for USB modems and serial devices that
     implement the Communication Device Class Abstract Control Model (CDC
     ACM).  It also provides device-side CDC ACM support.  Supported modems
     are basically standard serial line modems, but they are accessed via USB
     instead.  They support a regular AT command set.  The commands can either
     be multiplexed with the data stream or handled through separate pipes.
     In the latter case the AT commands have to be given on a device separate
     from the data device.

     The device is accessed through the ucom(4) driver which makes it behave
     like a tty(4).

HISTORY
     The umodem driver appeared in NetBSD 1.5.  This manual page was adopted
     from NetBSD by Tom Rhodes <trhodes@FreeBSD.org> in April 2002.

BUGS
     Only modems with multiplexed commands and data are supported at the
     moment.
