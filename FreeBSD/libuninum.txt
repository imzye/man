NAME
       numconv - convert numbers from one number system to another

SYNOPSIS
       Numconv <options>

DESCRIPTION
       numconv is a filter that converts integers from one number system to
       another.  For example, it can convert from Roman Numerals such as
       "CCLVI" to ordinary Western numbers such as "256" or from Western
       numbers to Chinese.  The great majority of number systems, both modern
       and ancient, are supported, including numerous variants.

       If the input number system is 'all', the number system will be
       autodetected.

       numconv is a command line interface to libuninum a library for
       converting between textual representations of numbers and machine-
       internal representations. Further information about the conversions
       performed is available in the documentation for this library.
