NAME
       Crypt::Rabbit - A new stream cipher based on the properties of counter
       assisted stream ciphers

SYNOPSIS
           use Crypt::Rabbit;

           $cipher = new Crypt::Rabbit $key;
           $ciphertext = $cipher->encrypt($plaintext);
           $ks = $cipher->keysize();
           $plaintext  = $cipher->decrypt($ciphertext);

DESCRIPTION
       Rabbit is a new stream cipher based on the properties of counter
       assisted stream ciphers, invented by Martin Boesgaard, Mette
       Vesterager, Thomas Pedersen, Jesper Christiansen, and Ove Scavenius of
       Cryptico A/S.

       This module supports the following methods:

       new()
           Initializes the internal states of Rabbit

       encrypt($data)
           Encrypts the data stream $data

       decrypt($data)
           Decrypts the data stream $data

           decrypt($data) is the same as encrypt($data)

       keysize()
           Returns the size (in bytes) of the key used (16, in this case)

CAVEAT
       The internal states of Rabbit are updated every time encrypt() or
       decrypt() are called. And since encryption/decryption depends on the
       internal states, a plaintext encrypted with a call to encrypt() will
       not decrypt to the original message by just a call to decrypt(). The
       proper way to decrypt a ciphertext is to re-initialize the internal
       states (by calling new()) first before calling decrypt().

BUG
       For the sake of simplicity, the C implementation encrypts and decrypts
       data in multiples of 16 bytes. If the last block of data is not a
       multiple of 16 bytes, it is padded with null characters before
       encryption. The resulting ciphertext is then truncated to the original
       message length before being output. An undesirable consequence of this
       is that encryption/decryption always starts at multiples of 16 bytes of
       the pseudorandom data stream produced by Rabbit. Improvements are most
       welcome. Please read contact.html for contact information.
