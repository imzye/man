Math::SymbolicX::BigNum(3)                 User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Math::SymbolicX::BigNum - Big number support for the Math::Symbolic
       parser

SYNOPSIS
         use Math::Symbolic qw/parse_from_string/;
         use Math::SymbolicX::BigNum;

         my $formula = parse_from_string('bignum(1000000000000000000000000000) + 1');
         print $formula->value();
         # prints 1000000000000000000000000001 instead of the incaccurate 1e+27

DESCRIPTION
       This module adds big number support to Math::Symbolic. It does so by
       extending the parser of the Math::Symbolic module (that is, the one
       stored in $Math::Symbolic::Parser) with certain special functions that
       create arbitrary precision constants. (Math::Symbolic::Variable objects
       have been able to contain arbitrary precision objects since the very
       beginning.)

   MOTIVATION
       All constants in strings that are parsed by Math::Symbolic::Parser are
       converted to Math::Symbolic::Constant objects holding the value
       associated to the constant in an ordinary Perl Scalar by default.
       Unfortunately, that means if you get a really big integer or a
       fraction, you are subject to the precision limitations of the
       underlying floating point variables.

       On the other hand, Tels wrote the formidable Math::Big* modules to make
       arbitrary precision calculations possible, so since the
       Math::Symbolic::Scalar objects can hold any object, you can build your
       trees by hand using Math::Big* objects instead of Perl Scalars for the
       value of the constants.  But since the Math::Symbolic::Parser is by far
       the most convenient interface to Math::Symbolic, there had to be a
       reasonably simple way of introducing Math::Big* support to the parser.
       So here goes.

   USAGE
       In order to get arbitrary precision constants in Math::Symbolic trees
       from the parser, you just load this extension module and wrap any of
       the hereafter listed functions around any constants that are or may
       become big (or small).

       The aformentioned functions are bigint(...), bigrat(...), bigfloat(...)
       and bignum(...) with bignum playing a special role.  Obviously,
       bigint(...), bigrat(...) and bigfloat(...) return objects of the
       associated type (Math::BigInt, ...). bignum(...), however, returns a
       Math::BigRat if the argument conains a slash and a Math::BigFloat
       otherwise.

       Example usage:

         print parse_from_string('bigrat(1) / 9 + 2*3 - bigrat(2/7)')->simplify();

       This prints '367/63', but if you were to leave the second call to
       bigrat() out, it would print '26214285714285713/4500000000000000'
       because the '2/7' would be calculated before they were added to the
       Math::BigRat object preventing it from working its magic.
