Net::Whois::Generic(3)                     User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Net::Whois::Generic - a pure-Perl implementation of a multi source
       Whois client.

SYNOPSIS
       Net::Whois::Generic is my first attempt to unify Whois information from
       different sources.  Historically Net::Whois::RIPE was the first
       written, then Net::Whois::Object was added to provide a RPSL
       encapsultation of the data returned from RIPE database, with an API
       more object oriented.

       Net::Whois::Generic is a new interface designed to be more generic and
       to encapsulate data from various sources (RIPE, but also AFRINIC,
       APNIC...)  The current implementation is barely a proof of concept,
       AFRINIC and APNIC are the only other sources implemented, but I expect
       to turn it into a generic/robust implementation based on the users
       feedback.

           my $c = Net::Whois::Generic->new( disconnected => 1, unfiltered => 1 );

           my ($org) = $c->query( 'ORG-AFNC1-AFRINIC', { type => 'organisation' } );
           # $org is a 'Net::Whois::Object::Organisation::AFRINIC' object;

           my @o = $c->query('101.0.0.0/8');
           # @o contains various Net::Whois::Object:Inetnum::APNIC, and Net::Whois::Object::Information objects

       As Net::Whois::Generic started as an improvment of Net::Whois::RIPE,
       and have a good amount of code in common, for this reason (and some
       others) it is currently bundled inside the the Net::Whois::RIPE
       package.  This might change in the future although.

METHODS
   new( %options )
       Constructor. Returns a new Net::Whois::Generic object with an open
       connection to the RIPE Database service of choice (defaulting to
       "whois.ripe.net:43").

       The %options hash migth contain configuration options for the RIPE
       Database server. Not all options provided by the RIPE Database server
       are suitable for this implementation, but the idea is to provide
       everything someone can show a use for. The options currently recognized
       are:

       hostname  (IPv4 address or DNS name. Default is "whois.ripe.net")
           The hostname or IP address of the service to connect to

       port (integer, default is 43)
           The TCP port of the service to connect to

       timeout (integer, default is 5)
           The time-out (in seconds) for the TCP connection.

       referral (boolean, default is "false")
           When true, prevents the server from using the referral mechanism
           for domain lookups, so that the RIPE Database server returns an
           object in the RIPE Database with the exact match with the lookup
           argument, rather than doing a referral lookup.

       recursive (boolean, default is "false")
           When set to "true", prevents recursion into queried objects for
           personal information. This prevents lots of unsolicited objects
           from showing up on queries.

       grouping (boolean, default is "false")
           When "true" enables object grouping in server responses. There's
           little utility to enable this option, as the objects will be parsed
           and returned on a much reasonable format most of the time. For the
           brave or more knowledgeable people that want to have they answers
           in plain text, this can help stablishing a 'good' ordering for the
           RPSL objects returned by a query ('good' is RIPE NCC's definition
           of 'good' in this case).

       unfiltered (boolean, default is "false")
           When "true" enables unfiltered object output responses. This
           produces objects that can be presented back to the RIPE Database
           for updating.

       types (list of valid RIPE Database object types, default is empty,
       meaning all types)
           Restrict the RPSL object types allowed in the response to those in
           the list.  Using this option will cause the Net::Whois::Generic
           object to query the RIPE Database for the available object types
           for validating the list. The response will be cached for speed and
           bandwidth.

       disconnected (boolean, default is "false")
           Prevents the constructor from automatically opening a connection to
           the service specified (conneting the socket is the default
           behavior). When set ("true"), the programmer is responsible for
           calling "connect" in order to stablish a connection to the RIPE
           Database service desired.

   hostname( [$hostname] )
       Accessor to the hostname. Accepts an optional hostname, always return
       the current hostname.

   port()
       Accessor to the port. Accepts an optional port, always return the
       current port.

   timeout()
       Accessor to the timeout configuration option. Accepts an optional
       timeout, always return the current timeout.

   referral()
       Accessor to the referral configuration option. Accepts an optional
       referral, always return the current referral.

   recursive()
       Accessor to the recursive configuration option. Accepts an optional
       recursive, always return the current recursive.

   grouping()
       Accessor to the grouping configuration option. Accepts an optional
       grouping, always return the current grouping.

   unfiltered()
       Accessor to the unfiltered configuration option.

   connect()
       Initiates a connection with the current object's configuration.

   ios()
       Accessor to the IO::Select object coordinating the I/O to the
       IO::Socket object used by this module to communicate with the RIPE
       Database Server. You shouldn't use this object, but the "send()" and
       "query( $query_string )" methods instead.

   socket()
       Read-only accessor to the IO::Socket object used by this module.

   send()
       Sends a message to the RIPE Database server instance to which we're
       connected to. Dies if it cannot write, or if there's no open connection
       to the server.

       Return "true" if the message could be written to the socket, "false"
       otherwise.

   reconnect()
       Reconnects to the server in case we lost connection.

   disconnect()
       Disconnects this client from the server. This renders the client
       useless until you call "connect()" again. This method is called by
       "DESTROY()" as part of an object's clean-up process.

   is_connected()
       Returns "true" if this instance is connected to the RIPE Database
       service configured.

   DESTROY()
       Net::Whois::Generic object destructor. Called by the Perl interpreter
       upon destruction of an instance.

   _find_rir( $query_string )
       Guess the associated RIR based on the query.

   adapt_query( $query_string[, $rir] )
       Adapt a query to set various parameter (whois server, query options...)
       based on the query.  Takes an optional parameter $rir, to force a
       specific RIR to be used.

   query( $query, [\%options] )
        ******************************** EXPERIMENTAL ************************************
          This method is a work in progress, the API and behaviour are subject to change
        **********************************************************************************

       Query the the appropriate RIR database and return Net::Whois::Objects

       This method accepts 2 optional parameters

       'type' which is a regex used to filter the query result: Only the
       object whose type matches the 'type' parameter are returned

       'attribute' which is a regex used to filter the query result: Only the
       value of the attributes matching the 'attribute' parameter are returned

       Note that if 'attribute' is specified strings are returned, instead of
       Net::Whois::Objects

       Net::Whois:Generic->query() deprecates  Net::Whois::Object->query()
       since release 2.005 of Net::Whois::RIPE

   object_types()
       Return a list of known object types from the RIPE Database.

       RIPE currently returns 21 types (Limerik have been removed): as-block
       as-set aut-num domain filter-set inet6num inetnum inet-rtr irt key-cert
       mntner organisation peering-set person poem poetic-form role route
       route6 route-set rtr-set

       Due to some strange mis-behaviour in the protocol (or documentation?)
       the RIPE Database server won't allow a keep-alive token with this
       query, meaning the connection will be terminated after this query.

   _process_response( $response )
       Process a response (error code, error message...)

CAVEATS
       Update
           Update of objects from database other than RIPE is not currently
           implemented...

       Sources
           Currently the only sources implemented are RIPE, AFRINIC, and
           APNIC.

       Maturity
           The Net::Whois::Generic interface is highly experimental.  There
           are probably bugs, without any doubt missing documentation and
           examples but please don't hesitate to contact me to suggest
           corrections and improvments.

BUGS
       Please report any bugs or feature requests to "bug-net-whois-ripe at
       rt.cpan.org", or through the web interface at
       <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=net-whois-ripe>.  I
       will be notified, and then you'll automatically be notified of progress
       on your bug as I make changes.

SEE ALSO
       There are several tools similar to Net::Whois::Generic, I'll list some
       of them below and some reasons why Net::Whois::Generic exists anyway:

       Net::Whois::IANA - A universal WHOIS extractor: update not possible, no
       RPSL parser

       Net::Whois::ARIN - ARIN whois client: update not possible, only subset
       of ARIN objects handled

       Net::Whois::Parser - Module for parsing whois information: no query
       handling, parser can (must?) be added

       Net::Whois::RIPE - RIPE whois client: the basis for Net::Whois::Generic
       but only handle RIPE.
