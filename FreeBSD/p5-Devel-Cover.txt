        coverage_database [coverage_database ...]

       The "-report", "-select", "-ignore", "-select_re", "-ignore_re", and
       "-coverage" options may be specified multiple times.

REPORT FORMATS
       The following "-report" options are available in the core module.
       Other reports may be available if they've been installed from external
       packages.

       html|html_minimal (default)
           HTML reporting. Percentage thresholds are colour-coded and
           configurable via -report_c0 <integer>, -report_c1 <integer> and
           -report_c2 <integer>.:

               0%      75%      90%      100%
               |   ..   |   ..   |   ..   |
                  <c0      <c1      <c2   c3
                  red     yellow   orange green

       html_basic
           HTML reporting with syntax highlighting if PPI::HTML or Perl::Tidy
           module is detected. Like html|html_minimal reporting, percentage
           thresholds are colour-coded and configurable.

       text
           Plain text reporting.

       compilation
           A textual report in a format similar to that output by Perl itself
           such that the report may be used by your editor or other reporting
           tools to show where coverage is missing.

       json
           A report in JSON format.

       vim A report suitable for use with the vim editor to show coverage data
           in the sign column.

DETAILS
       Any number of coverage databases may be specified on the command line.
       These databases will be merged and the reports will be based on the
       merged information.  If no databases are specified the default database
       (cover_db) will be used.

       The "-write" option will write out the merged database.  If no name is
       given for the new database, the first database read in will be
       overwritten.  When this option is used no reports are generated by
       default.

       Specify the "-select", "-select_re", "-ignore", and "-ignore_re"
       options to report on specific files.  "-select" and "-ignore" are
       interpreted as shell globs; "-select_re" and "-ignore_re" are
       interpreted as regular expressions.

       Specify "-coverage" options to report on specific criteria.  By default
       all available information on all criteria in all files will be
       reported.  Available coverage options are statement, branch, condition,
       subroutine, pod, and default (which equates to all available options).
       However, if you know you only want coverage information for certain
       criteria it is better to only collect data for those criteria in the
       first place by specifying them at that point.  This will make the data
       collection and reporting processes faster and less memory intensive.
       See the documentation for Devel::Cover for more information.

       If you want all *except* some criteria, then you can say something like
       "-coverage default,-pod".

       If you specify multiple "-report" options, make sure that they do not
       conflict.  For example, the different HTML reports will overwrite each
       other's results.

       The "-test" option will delete the databases and run your tests to
       generate new coverage data before reporting on it.  Devel::Cover knows
       how to work with standard Perl Makefiles as well as Module::Build based
       distributions.  For detailed instructions see the documentation for
       ExtUtils::MakeMaker at
       <https://metacpan.org/module/ExtUtils::MakeMaker> or for Module::Build
       at <https://metacpan.org/module/Module::Build> both of which come as
       standard in recent Perl distributions.

       The "-gcov" option will try to run gcov on any XS code.  This requires
       that you are using gcc of course.  If you are using the "-test" option
       will be turned on by default. If you have XS code in subdirectories,
       you will probably need to add the "-gcov_chdir" option since gcov seems
       to work better with that.

       The "-prefer_lib" option tells Devel::Cover to report on files in the
       lib directory even if they were used from the blib directory.

       The "-ignore_covered_err" option will not flag an error if uncoverable
       code is covered.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values are returned:

       0   All operations were completed successfully.

       >0  An error occurred.

       With the -test option the exit status of the underlying test run is
       returned.
