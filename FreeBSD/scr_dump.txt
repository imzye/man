NAME
       scr_dump - format of curses screen-dumps.

SYNOPSIS
       scr_dump

DESCRIPTION
       The curses library provides applications with the ability to write the
       contents of a window to an external file using scr_dump or putwin, and
       read it back using scr_restore or getwin.

       The putwin and getwin functions do the work; while scr_dump and
       scr_restore conveniently save and restore the whole screen, i.e.,
       stdscr.

   ncurses6
       A longstanding implementation of screen-dump was revised with ncurses6
       to remedy problems with the earlier approach:

       •   A “magic number” is written to the beginning of the dump file,
           allowing applications (such as file(1)) to recognize curses dump
           files.

           Because ncurses6 uses a new format, that requires a new magic
           number was unused by other applications.  This 16-bit number was
           unused:

               0x8888 (octal “\210\210”)

           but to be more certain, this 32-bit number was chosen:

               0x88888888 (octal “\210\210\210\210”)

           This is the pattern submitted to the maintainers of the file
           program:

               #
               # ncurses5 (and before) did not use a magic number,
               # making screen dumps "data".
               #
               # ncurses6 (2015) uses this format, ignoring byte-order
               0    string    \210\210\210\210ncurses    ncurses6 screen image
               #

       •   The screen dumps are written in textual form, so that internal data
           sizes are not directly related to the dump-format, and enabling the
           library to read dumps from either narrow- or wide-character-
           configurations.

           The narrow library configuration holds characters and video
           attributes in a 32-bit chtype, while the wide-character library
           stores this information in the cchar_t structure, which is much
           larger than 32-bits.

       •   It is possible to read a screen dump into a terminal with a
           different screen-size, because the library truncates or fills the
           screen as necessary.

       •   The ncurses6 getwin reads the legacy screen dumps from ncurses5.

   ncurses5 (legacy)
       The screen-dump feature was added to ncurses in June 1995.  While there
       were fixes and improvements in succeeding years, the basic scheme was
       unchanged:

       •   The WINDOW structure was written in binary form.

       •   The WINDOW structure refers to lines of data, which were written as
           an array of binary data following the WINDOW.

       •   When getwin restored the window, it would keep track of offsets
           into the array of line-data and adjust the WINDOW structure which
           was read back into memory.

       This is similar to Unix SystemV, but does not write a “magic number” to
       identify the file format.

PORTABILITY
       There is no standard format for putwin.  This section gives a brief
       description of the existing formats.

   X/Open Curses
       Refer to X/Open Curses, Issue 7 (2009).

       X/Open's documentation for enhanced curses says only:

          The getwin(_) function reads window-related data stored in the file
          by putwin(_).  The function then creates and initializes a new
          window using that data.

          The putwin(_) function writes all data associated with win into the
          stdio stream to which filep points, using an unspecified format.
          This information can be retrieved later using getwin(_).

       In the mid-1990s when the X/Open Curses document was written, there
       were still systems using older, less capable curses libraries (aside
       from the BSD curses library which was not relevant to X/Open because it
       did not meet the criteria for base curses).  The document explained the
       term “enhanced” as follows:

          •   Shading is used to identify X/Open Enhanced Curses material,
              relating to interfaces included to provide enhanced capabilities
              for applications originally written to be compiled on systems
              based on the UNIX operating system.  Therefore, the features
              described may not be present on systems that conform to XPG4 or
              to earlier XPG releases.  The relevant reference pages may
              provide additional or more specific portability warnings about
              use of the material.

       In the foregoing, emphasis was added to unspecified format and to XPG4
       or to earlier XPG releases, for clarity.

   Unix SystemV
       Unix SystemV curses identified the file format by writing a “magic
       number” at the beginning of the dump.  The WINDOW data and the lines of
       text follow, all in binary form.

       The Solaris curses source has these definitions:

           /* terminfo magic number */
           #define MAGNUM  0432

           /* curses screen dump magic number */
           #define SVR2_DUMP_MAGIC_NUMBER  0433
           #define SVR3_DUMP_MAGIC_NUMBER  0434

       That is, the feature was likely introduced in SVr2 (1984), and improved
       in SVr3 (1987).  The Solaris curses source has no magic number for SVr4
       (1989).  Other operating systems (AIX and HPUX) use a magic number
       which would correspond to this definition:

           /* curses screen dump magic number */
           #define SVR4_DUMP_MAGIC_NUMBER  0435

       That octal number in bytes is 001, 035.  Because most Unix vendors use
       big-endian hardware, the magic number is written with the high-order
       byte first, e.g.,

            01 35

       After the magic number, the WINDOW structure and line-data are written
       in binary format.  While the magic number used by the Unix systems can
       be seen using od(1), none of the Unix systems documents the format used
       for screen-dumps.

       The Unix systems do not use identical formats.  While collecting
       information for for this manual page, the savescreen test-program
       produced dumps of different size (all on 64-bit hardware, on 40x80
       screens):

       •   AIX (51817 bytes)

       •   HPUX (90093 bytes)

       •   Solaris 10 (13273 bytes)

       •   ncurses5 (12888 bytes)

   Solaris
       As noted above, Solaris curses has no magic number corresponding to
       SVr4 curses.  This is odd since Solaris was the first operating system
       to pass the SVr4 guidelines.  Solaris has two versions of curses:

       •   The default curses library uses the SVr3 magic number.

       •   There is an alternate curses library in /usr/xpg4.  This uses a
           textual format with no magic number.

           According to the copyright notice, the xpg4 Solaris curses library
           was developed by MKS (Mortice Kern Systems) from 1990 to 1995.

           Like ncurses6, there is a file-header with parameters.  Unlike
           ncurses6, the contents of the window are written piecemeal, with
           coordinates and attributes for each chunk of text rather than
           writing the whole window from top to bottom.

   PDCurses
       PDCurses added support for screen dumps in version 2.7 (2005).  Like
       Unix SystemV and ncurses5, it writes the WINDOW structure in binary,
       but begins the file with its three-byte identifier “PDC”, followed by a
       one-byte version, e.g.,

                “PDC\001”

   NetBSD
       As of April 2017, NetBSD curses does not support scr_dump and
       scr_restore (or scr_init, scr_set), although it has putwin and getwin.

       Like ncurses5, NetBSD putwin does not identify its dumps with a useful
       magic number.  It writes

       •   the curses shared library major and minor versions as the first two
           bytes (e.g., 7 and 1),

       •   followed by a binary dump of the WINDOW,

       •   some data for wide-characters referenced by the WINDOW structure,
           and

       •   finally, lines as done by other implementations.

EXAMPLE
       Given a simple program which writes text to the screen (and for the
       sake of example, limiting the screen-size to 10x20):

           #include <curses.h>

           int
           main(void)
           {
               putenv("LINES=10");
               putenv("COLUMNS=20");
               initscr();
               start_color();
               init_pair(1, COLOR_WHITE, COLOR_BLUE);
               init_pair(2, COLOR_RED, COLOR_BLACK);
               bkgd(COLOR_PAIR(1));
               move(4, 5);
               attron(A_BOLD);
               addstr("Hello");
               move(5, 5);
               attroff(A_BOLD);
               attrset(A_REVERSE | COLOR_PAIR(2));
               addstr("World!");
               refresh();
               scr_dump("foo.out");
               endwin();
               return 0;
           }

       When run using ncurses6, the output looks like this:

           \210\210\210\210ncurses 6.0.20170415
           _cury=5
           _curx=11
           _maxy=9
           _maxx=19
           _flags=14
           _attrs=\{REVERSE|C2}
           flag=_idcok
           _delay=-1
           _regbottom=9
           _bkgrnd=\{NORMAL|C1}\s
           rows:
           1:\{NORMAL|C1}\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s
           2:\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s

           7:\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s

           10:\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s

       The first four octal escapes are actually nonprinting characters, while
       the remainder of the file is printable text.  You may notice:

       •   The actual color pair values are not written to the file.

       •   All characters are shown in printable form; spaces are “\s” to
           ensure they are not overlooked.

       •   Attributes are written in escaped curly braces, e.g., “\{BOLD}”,
           and may include a color-pair (C1 or C2 in this example).

       •   The parameters in the header are written out only if they are
           nonzero.  When reading back, order does not matter.

       Running the same program with Solaris xpg4 curses gives this dump:

           MAX=10,20
           BEG=0,0
           SCROLL=0,10
           VMIN=1
           VTIME=0

           4,10,0,1,
           4,19,0,0,
           5,0,0,1,
           5,5,0x4,2,World!
           5,11,0,1,
           5,19,0,0,
           6,0,0,1,
           6,19,0,0,
           7,0,0,1,
           7,19,0,0,
           8,0,0,1,
           8,19,0,0,
           9,0,0,1,
           9,19,0,0,
           CUR=11,5

       Solaris getwin requires that all parameters are present, and in the
       same order.  The xpg4 curses library does not know about the bce (back
       color erase) capability, and does not color the window background.

       On the other hand, the SVr4 curses library does know about the
       background color.  However, its screen dumps are in binary.  Here is
       the corresponding dump (using “od -t x1”):
