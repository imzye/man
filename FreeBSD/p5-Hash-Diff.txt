NAME
       Hash::Diff - Return difference between two hashes as a hash

SYNOPSIS
           use Hash::Diff qw( diff );
           my %a = (
                       'foo'    => 1,
                   'bar'    => { a => 1, b => 1 },
               );
           my %b = (
                       'foo'     => 2,
                       'bar'    => { a => 1 },
               );

           my %c = %{ diff( \%a, \%b ) };

           # %c = %{ foo => 1, bar => { b => 1} }

DESCRIPTION
       Hash::Diff returns the difference between two hashes as a hash.

       diff ( <hashref>, <hashref> )
           Diffs two hashes.  Returns a reference to the new hash.

       left_diff ( <hashref>, <hashref> )
           Returns the values in the left hash that is not, or different from
           the right hash.

CAVEATS
       This will not handle self-referencing/recursion within hashes well.
       This will only handle HASH and SCALAR.

       Plans for a future version include incorporate deep recursion
       protection.  And support for ARRAY.
