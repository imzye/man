NAME
       ad - adaptable text editor and CLI for filtering and transforming text

SYNOPSIS
       ad [-v] [--version] [-h] [--help]
          [-e script] [--expression=script]
          [-f script-file] [--script-file=script-file]
          [file...]

DESCRIPTION
       ad is a text editor and command line stream editor.  The text editor
       interface f ad is inspired by the likes of vim, kakoune and plan9's
       acme and sam editors. ad aims to provide an "integrating develpment
       environment" as opposed to an "integrated" one: leveraging the
       surrounding system for the majority of functionality outside of core
       text editing actions.

       -e, --expression=script

              specify an editing script to be executed

       -f, --script-file=script-file

              specify a file containing an editing script to be executed

       -h, --help

              display help text and exit

       -v, --version

              output version information and exit

       If no -e, --expression, -f, or --script-file option is given, then all
       arguments are taken to be input files to be edited interactively.  If
       an editing script is specified then the remaining arguments are taken
       to be files to which the script should be applied.
