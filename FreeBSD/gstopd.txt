GSTOPD(8)               FreeBSD System Manager's Manual              GSTOPD(8)

NAME
     gstopd – stop disks in the case of inactivity using GEOM statistics

SYNOPSIS
     gstopd [-I interval] diskX ...

DESCRIPTION
     The gstopd daemon can be used to stop disks after an certain amount of
     inactivity using geom(4) statisics.  Messages get logged via syslog(3)
     using the local0.info priority.

     The options are as follows:

     -I interval
             The amount of inactivity in seconds of a disk after which the
             disk should get stopped Adding a suffix of m, h, or s (the
             default) indicates that the update interval is specified in
             minutes, hours, or seconds, respectively.

     diskX   Specifies one or more disks which should get monitored and stoped
             if appropriate.

SEE ALSO
     gstat(8) geom(4)

HISTORY
     A gstopd utility appeared in FreeBSD 5.2.

BUGS
     The gstopd daemon is currently only able to stop disks which are
     connected to CAM(4) subsystem.

     Since it stops disks using the external camcontrol(8) tool it will be
     difficult to get the disk with the root filesystem on it stopped.
