NAME
       dnsjit - DNS engine based around LuaJIT for capturing, parsing,
       replaying and statistics gathering

SYNOPSIS
   Run a Lua script
       dnsjit file.lua ...

   Shebang-style
         #!/usr/bin/env dnsjit
         ...

DESCRIPTION
       dnsjit is a combination of parts taken from dsc, dnscap, drool, and put
       together around Lua to create a script-based engine for easy capturing,
       parsing and statistics gathering of DNS message while also providing
       facilities for replaying DNS traffic.

       One of the core functionality that dnsjit brings is to tie together C
       and Lua modules through a receiver/receive interface.  This allows
       creation of custom chains of functionality to meet various
       requirements.  Another core functionality is the ability to parse and
       process DNS messages even if the messages are non-compliant with the
       DNS standards.

       NOTE current implementation is ALPHA which means functionality are not
       set and may be changed or removed.

MODULE CATEGORIES
       The following Lua module categories exists:

       dnsjit.core
              Core modules for handling things like logging, DNS messages and
              receiver/receive functionality.

       dnsjit.lib
              Various Lua libraries or C library bindings.

       dnsjit.input
              Input modules used to read DNS messages in various ways.

       dnsjit.filter
              Filter modules to process or manipulate DNS messages.

       dnsjit.output
              Output modules used to display DNS message, export to various
              formats or replay them against other targets.

       See each category's man-page for more information.

LUA GLOBALS
       The following Lua global variables are defined:

       DNSJIT_VERSION
              A string with the full version.

       DNSJIT_MAJOR_VERSION
              An integer with the major version number.

       DNSJIT_MINOR_VERSION
              An integer with the minor version number.

       DNSJIT_PATCH_VERSION
              An integer with the patch version number.

       DNSJIT_BUGREPORT
              A string with the email address to file bug reports to.

       DNSJIT_URL
              A string with the URL to the repository issue tracker, preferred
              place to file bug reports.

EXAMPLE
       Following example display the DNS ID found in queries.

         local input = require("dnsjit.input.pcapthread").new()
         local output = require("dnsjit.filter.lua").new()

         output:func(function(filter, object)
             local packet = object:cast()
             local dns = require("dnsjit.core.object.dns").new(packet)
             dns:parse()
             print(dns.id)
         end)

         input:open_offline("file.pcap")
         input:only_queries(true)
         input:receiver(output)
         input:run()

       See more examples in the examples directory.
