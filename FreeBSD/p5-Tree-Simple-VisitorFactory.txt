NAME
       Tree::Simple::Visitor::BreadthFirstTraversal - A Visitor for
       breadth-first traversal a Tree::Simple hierarchy

SYNOPSIS
         use Tree::Simple::Visitor::BreadthFirstTraversal;

         # create an visitor
         my $visitor = Tree::Simple::Visitor::BreadthFirstTraversal->new();

         # pass our visitor to the tree
         $tree->accept($visitor);

         # print our results
         print join ", " => $visitor->getResults();

         # this will print this:
         #   1, 2, 3, 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 3.1, 1.1.1
         # assuming your tree is like this:
         #   1
         #     1.1
         #       1.1.1
         #     1.2
         #   2
         #     2.1
         #   3
         #     3.1

DESCRIPTION
       This implements a breadth-first traversal of a Tree::Simple hierarchy.
       This can be an alternative to the built in depth-first traversal of the
       Tree::Simple "traverse" method.

METHODS
       new There are no arguments to the constructor the object will be in its
           default state. You can use the  "setNodeFilter" method to customize
           its behavior.

       includeTrunk ($boolean)
           Based upon the value of $boolean, this will tell the visitor to
           include the trunk of the tree in the traversal as well.

       setNodeFilter ($filter_function)
           This method accepts a CODE reference as its $filter_function
           argument and throws an exception if it is not a code reference.
           This code reference is used to filter the tree nodes as they are
           collected. This can be used to customize output, or to gather
           specific information from a more complex tree node. The filter
           function should accept a single argument, which is the current
           Tree::Simple object.

       visit ($tree)
           This is the method that is used by the Tree::Simple "accept"
           method. It can also be used on its own, it requires the $tree
           argument to be a Tree::Simple object (or derived from a
           Tree::Simple object), and will throw and exception otherwise.

       getResults
           This method returns the accumulated results of the application of
           the node filter to the tree.

SEE ALSO
       These Visitor classes are all subclasses of Tree::Simple::Visitor,
       which can be found in the Tree::Simple module, you should refer to that
       module for more information.
