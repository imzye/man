Data::Taxonomy::Tags(3)                    User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Data::Taxonomy::Tags - Represents a set of tags for any item

SYNOPSIS
           use Data::Taxonomy::Tags;

           my $tags = Data::Taxonomy::Tags->new('perl tags cpan module system:meta');

           print $_, "\n" for $tags->tags;

           print $_, "\n" for $tags->categories;

DESCRIPTION
       Data::Taxonomy::Tags will basically take care of managing tags for an
       item easier.  You provide it with a string of tags and it'll allow you
       to call methods to get all the tags and categories as well as add and
       delete tags from the list.

   Methods
       new($string[,\%options])
                   The first argument is a string of tags.  This string is
                   stripped of any leading and trailing whitespace.  The
                   second argument, which is optional, is a hashref of
                   options.

                   Returns a Data::Taxonomy::Tags object;

                   "separator => ['\s+', ' ']"
                                           Specifies the regex pattern (or
                                           compiled regex) which will be used
                                           to "split" the tags apart and the
                                           character(s) used between tags when
                                           converting the object back to a
                                           string.  Make sure to escape any
                                           special characters in the regex
                                           pattern.

                                           If the value is not an arrayref,
                                           then the same value is used for
                                           both operations (and is escaped for
                                           the regex).

                                           Defaults to "['\s+', ' ']".

                   "category => [':', ':']"
                                           Specifies the regex pattern (or
                                           compiled regex) which will be used
                                           to "split" the tag name from it's
                                           optional category and the
                                           character(s) used between the
                                           category and tag when converting to
                                           a string.  Make sure to escape any
                                           special characters in the regex
                                           pattern.

                                           If the value is not an arrayref,
                                           then the same value is used for
                                           both operations (and is escaped for
                                           the regex).

                                           Defaults to "[':', ':']".

       tags        Returns an array or arrayref (depending on context) of
                   Data::Taxonomy::Tags::Tag objects.

       add_to_tags($tags)
                   Processes the string and adds the tag(s) to the object.

       remove_from_tags($tags)
                   Processes the string and removes the tag(s) from the
                   object.

       remove_category($category)
                   Removes all tags with the specified category.

       categories  Returns an array or arrayref (depending on context) of the
                   unique categories.

       tags_with_category($category)
                   Returns an array or arrayref (depending on context) of the
                   tags with the specified category

       as_string   Returns the tag list as a string (that is, what was given
                   to the constructor).  Overloading is used as well to
                   automatically call this method if the object is used in a
                   string context.
