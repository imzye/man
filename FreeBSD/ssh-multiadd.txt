ssh-multiadd(1)         FreeBSD General Commands Manual        ssh-multiadd(1)

NAME
       ssh-multiadd - ssh-add multiple ssh keys with the same passphrase(s) to
       ssh-agent

SYNOPSIS
       ssh-multiadd [opts] [keyfiles]

DESCRIPTION
       Add multiple ssh keys that may use the same passphrase(s) to the ssh
       authentication agent.  When run without arguments, it adds
       $HOME/.ssh/identity and $HOME/.ssh/id_dsa.  Alternative file names can
       be given on the command line or specified in the configuration file.
       Uses ssh-askpass if necessary.  The files need not use the same
       passphrase, ssh-multiadd will try all entered passwords against each
       key, so any number of keys may share passphrases without having to
       reenter them.

OPTIONS
       -a auto|yes|no
              Specifies when to use ssh-askpass program instead of reading
              from terminal.  auto (the default) means to only use ssh-askpass
              when stdin is not a tty.  yes always uses ssh-askpass, and no
              never does.

       -A <path>
              Program to use instead of ssh-askpass.

       -s <path>
              Program to use instead of ssh-add.

       -S <path>
              Program to use instead of ssh.

       -d <path>
              Directory to look for keyfiles that do not have an absolute
              path.

       -f     Force all keys to be added, don't check if they are already
              loaded.  (equivalent to sshgetfingerprint=None in rc file)

       -l     When done, call "ssh-add -l" to list all identities represented
              by the agent.

       -L     Before and after running, call "ssh-add -l", then lists
              differences in represented identities.

       --nolist
              Don't list any identities when done.  In other words, disable -l
              or -L.

       -h/--help
              Print help info.

       --version
              Print unadorned version.

       --debug
              Enable printing of debug messages.  Note that it is possible in
              some circumstances that passphrases may appear in the output, so
              exercise caution if using this option.

CONFIGURATION
       The file ~/.ssh-multiadd.rc.py may be created to change the default
       options.  The following are the recognized variables (and what
       option(s) they correspond to):

       keys   A list (or tuple) of files to add if none are specified on the
              command line.
              ex: keys = ('identity', 'identity2', 'id_dsa')

       ssh (-S)
              A string containing the path to the ssh executable. (Used to get
              ssh version for setting sshgetfingerprint if it is not
              specified)
              ex: ssh = '/usr/local/bin/ssh'

       sshadd (-a)
              A string containing the path to the ssh-add executable.
              ex: sshadd = '/usr/local/bin/ssh-add'

       sshaskpass (-A)
              A string containing the path to the ssh-askpass executable.
              ex: sshaskpass = '/usr/local/bin/x11-ssh-askpass'

       sshdir (-d)
              A string containing the path to the dir in which to look for key
              files.
              ex: sshdir = os.path.expanduser('~/.ssh2')

       sshgetfingerprint
              A tuple containing (command to print fingerprint, regex to
              extract finger print from output).  If not specified or set to
              -1, the version from ssh -V will be checked and known values
              will be used.  Set to None to disable fingerprint checking.
              ex: sshgetfingerprint = ('/usr/bin/ssh-keygen -l -f "%s"',
              '(\S+\s+\S+)')

       useaskpass (-a)
              A string, either 'yes', 'no', or 'auto'.
              ex: useaskpass = 'no'

       verbose (--debug)
              An int specifying verbosity level.
              ex: verbose = 1

       listidentities (-l, -L, --nolist)
              An int specifying whether to list identities at exit.
              (0=--nolist, 1=-l, 2=-L)
              ex: listidentities = 2

FILES
       $HOME/.ssh/identity and $HOME/.ssh/id_dsa
              Default key files to add.

       $HOME/.ssh-multiadd.rc.py
              Optional configuration file.

ENVIRONMENT
       SSH_ASKPASS
              If specified and not overridden with -A, program to use instead
              of ssh-askpass.
