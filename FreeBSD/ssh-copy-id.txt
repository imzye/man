SSH-COPY-ID(1)          FreeBSD General Commands Manual         SSH-COPY-ID(1)

NAME
     ssh-copy-id – copy public keys to a remote host

SYNOPSIS
     ssh-copy-id [-lv] [-i keyfile] [-o option] [-p port] [user@]hostname

DESCRIPTION
     The ssh-copy-id utility copies public keys to a remote host's
     ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file (creating the file and directory, if
     required).

     The following options are available:

     -i file
             Copy the public key contained in file.  This option can be
             specified multiple times and can be combined with the -l option.
             If a private key is specified and a public key is found then the
             public key will be used.

     -l      Copy the keys currently held by ssh-agent(1).  This is the
             default if the -i option was not specified.

     -o ssh-option
             Pass this option directly to ssh(1).  This option can be
             specified multiple times.

     -p port
             Connect to the specified port on the remote host instead of the
             default.

     -v      Pass -v to ssh(1).

     The remaining arguments are a list of remote hosts to connect to, each
     one optionally qualified by a user name.

EXIT STATUS
     The ssh-copy-id utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     To send a specific key to multiple hosts:
           $ ssh-copy-id -i /path/to/keyfile.pub user@host1 user@host2
           user@host3

HISTORY
     The ssh-copy-id utility was written by Eitan Adler <eadler@FreeBSD.org>
     as a drop-in replacement for an existing utility included with OpenSSH.
