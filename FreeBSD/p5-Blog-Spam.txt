OVERVIEW
       The blogspam server makes use of the Blog::Spam::Server module to
       present an XML-RPC server for the use of testing comments for spam.

       It is ideally suited for small and medium sized blogs, forums, and
       similar sites which accept comments from users and which may be
       attacked by the submission of spam comments.

ABOUT
       This script is designed to be started by a non-privileged user, where
       it will launch an RPC::XML::Server instance listening upon the network.
       By default port 8888 will be used,but this may be changed via the
       appropriate command line option.

       All state will be stored in the home directory of the user s-blogspam
       if it exists upon the local system, otherwise in the current working
       directory beneath a directory named state/.

       In order to ensure that scheduled tasks are completed it is strongly
       recommended you add crontab entries, running as the launcher, to run
       three jobs:

           # blogspam entries to clear caches, etc.
