NAME
       y2l - Yacc to LaTeX grammar pretty printer

SYNOPSIS
       y2l [-- options] file
       Options:
       [-d] [-h] [-O] [-O{0,1,2}] [-p] [-t{regexp,file}] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       This utility takes a yacc(1) grammar description file and generates an
       EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form) grammar from it.  By default, the
       output will be a LaTeX(1) longtable environment, that can be \input{}
       into any LaTeX document.  Automatic substitution of symbolic terminals
       can also be taken care of.  Options control whether any optimization
       should be done on the grammar, and whether plain ASCII output should be
       generated instead.

OPTIONS
       -d     Write out debugging information to standard error.

       -h     Display a short usage summary on standard output and exit.

       -O     Optimize the yacc grammar.  This basic optimization will look
              for empty rules to make non-terminals optional.  It also
              recursively generates choice groups and optional groups and
              elements based on common prefix and suffix token lists.

       -O0    Turn off optimization.

       -O1    This gives the same optimization as the regular -O option.

       -O2    Do basic optimization.  In addition, multiple rules for the same
              non-terminal are combined as a choice group.  Rules that were
              optimized by the first phase as optional non-terminals are
              converted into repetitive rules if possible.

       -p     Generate plain ASCII output rather than LaTeX output.

       -tregexp
              Use the provided regular expression to determine whether a
              terminal is a lexical token rather than a literal.  This is
              useful for grammars where literal tokens represent string
              literals that differ only in that the string literals are all
              lowercase versions of the token.  Since this is a fairly common
              practise in yacc grammars, this option ha sbeen provided.

       -tfile Use the provided file as a mapping between literal tokens and
              the literal strings they represent.  Each line in the file
              should contain two identifiers: the first one is the lexical
              token, and the second one is the literal string it represents.

       -v     Display the program version information on standard error prior
              to doing any processing.

BUGS
       While no known bugs seem to exist, there are probably quite a few
       unknown bugs.
