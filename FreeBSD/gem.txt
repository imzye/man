GEM(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 GEM(4)

NAME
     gem – ERI/GEM/GMAC Ethernet device driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device miibus
           device gem

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_gem_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The gem driver provides support for the GMAC Ethernet hardware found
     mostly in the last Apple PowerBooks G3s and most G4-based Apple hardware,
     as well as Sun UltraSPARC machines.

     All controllers supported by the gem driver have TCP checksum offload
     capability for both receive and transmit, support for the reception and
     transmission of extended frames for vlan(4) and a 512-bit multicast hash
     filter.

HARDWARE
     Chips supported by the gem driver include:

     •   Apple GMAC
     •   Sun ERI 10/100 Mbps Ethernet
     •   Sun GEM Gigabit Ethernet

     The following add-on cards are known to work with the gem driver at this
     time:

     •   Sun Gigabit Ethernet PCI 2.0/3.0 (GBE/P) (part no. 501-4373)

SEE ALSO
     altq(4), miibus(4), netintro(4), vlan(4), ifconfig(8)

HISTORY
     The gem device driver appeared in NetBSD 1.6.  The first FreeBSD version
     to include it was FreeBSD 5.0.

AUTHORS
     The gem driver was written for NetBSD by Eduardo Horvath
     <eeh@NetBSD.org>.  It was ported to FreeBSD by Thomas Moestl
     <tmm@FreeBSD.org> and later on improved by Marius Strobl
     <marius@FreeBSD.org>.  The man page was written by Thomas Klausner
     <wiz@NetBSD.org>.
