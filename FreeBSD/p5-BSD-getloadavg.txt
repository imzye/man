NAME
       BSD::getloadavg - Perl Interface to getloadavg (3)

SYNOPSIS
         use BSD::getloadavg;
         my @loadavg = getloadavg();

DESCRIPTION
       This module allows you to access load average without invoking
       uptime(1).  Instead of

         my @loadavg = (qx(uptime) =~ /([\.\d]+)\s+([\.\d]+)\s+([\.\d]+)/);

       You can simply

         use BSD::getloadavg;
         my @loadavg = getloadavg();

COMPATIBILITY
       Though named BSD::getloadavg, this module also works on Linux and other
       platforms that support getloadavg.  To find if your platform supports
       this module, Just

         nm /usr/lib/libc.* | grep getloadavg

BENCHMARK
       You can run benchmark with t/benchmark.pl.  Here is the result in my
       platforms.

   EXPORT

SEE ALSO
       getloadavg(5)
         Also available as
         <http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=getloadavg&sektion=3>.
         Since getloadavg is in libc in most platform, Makefile.PL needed no
         tweaking.  If you find a platform that does not have getloadavg in
         libc, please report.

       Sys::CpuLoad
         This module accesses load average via /proc or uptime command.
         Therefore the performance is analogous to the benchmark above.

       BSD::Sysctl
         Seems like the most versatile module in this arena.  Unfortunately
         most platform-dependent also.  Works only on FreeBSD as of Version
         0.06.
