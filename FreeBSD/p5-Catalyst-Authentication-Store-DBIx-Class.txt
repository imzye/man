NAME
       Catalyst::Authentication::Realm::SimpleDB - A simplified Catalyst
       authentication configurator.

SYNOPSIS
           use Catalyst qw/
               Authentication
           /;

           __PACKAGE__->config->{'Plugin::Authentication'} =
               {
                   default => {
                       class      => 'SimpleDB',
                       user_model => 'MyApp::Schema::Users',
                   }
               }

           # later on ...
           $c->authenticate({ username => 'myusername',
                              password => 'mypassword' });

           my $age = $c->user->get('age');

           $c->logout;

DESCRIPTION
       The Catalyst::Authentication::Realm::SimpleDB provides a simple way to
       configure Catalyst Authentication when using the most common
       configuration of a password protected user retrieved from an SQL
       database.

CONFIGURATION
       The SimpleDB Realm class configures the Catalyst authentication system
       based on the following:

       •   Your user data is stored in a table that is accessible via
           $c->model($cfg->{user_model});

       •   Your passwords are stored in the 'password' field in your users
           table and are not encrypted.

       •   Your roles for users are stored in a separate table and are
           directly accessible via a DBIx::Class relationship called 'roles'
           and the text of the role is stored in a field called 'role' within
           the role table.

       •   Your user information is stored in the session once the user is
           authenticated.

       For the above usage, only one configuration option is necessary,
       'user_model'.  user_model should contain the class name of your user
       class. See the "PREPARATION" section for info on how to set up your
       database for use with this module.

       If your system differs from the above, some minor configuration may be
       necessary. The options available are detailed below. These options
       match the configuration options used by the underlying credential and
       store modules.  More information on these options can be found in
       Catalyst::Authentication::Credential::Password and
       Catalyst::Authentication::Store::DBIx::Class.

       user_model
           Contains the class name (as passed to $c->model() ) of the
           DBIx::Class schema to use as the source for user information.  This
           config item is REQUIRED.

       password_field
           If your password field is not 'password' set this option to the
           name of your password field.  Note that if you change this to, say
           'users_password' you will need to use that in the authenticate
           call:

               $c->authenticate({ username => 'bob', users_password => 'foo' });

       password_type
           If the password is not stored in plaintext you will need to define
           what format the password is in.  The common options are crypted and
           hashed.  Crypted uses the standard unix crypt to encrypt the
           password.  Hashed uses the Digest modules to perform password
           hashing.

       password_hash_type
           If you use a hashed password type - this defines the type of
           hashing. See Catalyst::Authentication::Credential::Password for
           more details on this setting.

       role_column
           If your users roles are stored directly in your user table, set
           this to the column name that contains your roles.  For example, if
           your user table contains a field called 'permissions', the value of
           role_column would be 'permissions'.  NOTE: If multiple values are
           stored in the role column, they should be space or pipe delimited.

       role_relation and role_field
           These define an alternate role relationship name and the column
           that holds the role's name in plain text.  See "CONFIGURATION" in
           Catalyst::Authentication::Store::DBIx::Class for more details on
           these settings.

       use_userdata_from_session
           This is a simple 1 / 0 setting which determines how a user's data
           is saved / restored from the session.  If it is set to 1, the
           user's complete information (at the time of authentication) is
           cached between requests.  If it is set to 0, the users information
           is loaded from the database on each request.

PREPARATION
       This module makes several assumptions about the structure of your
       database.  Below is an example of a table structure which will function
       with this module in it's default configuration. You can use this table
       structure as-is or add additional fields as necessary. NOTE that this
       is the default SimpleDB configuration only. Your table structure can
       differ significantly from this when using the DBIx::Class Store
       directly.

           --
           -- note that you can add any additional columns you require to the users table.
           --
           CREATE TABLE users (
                   id            INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                   username      TEXT,
                   password      TEXT,
           );

           CREATE TABLE roles (
                   id   INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                   role TEXT
           );
           CREATE TABLE user_roles (
                   user_id INTEGER,
                   role_id INTEGER,
                   PRIMARY KEY (user_id, role_id)
           );

       Also, after you have loaded this table structure into your DBIx::Class
       schema, please be sure that you have a many_to_many DBIx::Class
       relationship defined for the users to roles relation. Your schema files
       should contain something along these lines:

       "lib/MyApp/Schema/Users.pm":

           __PACKAGE__->has_many(map_user_role => 'MyApp::Schema::UserRoles', 'user_id');
           __PACKAGE__->many_to_many(roles => 'map_user_role', 'role');

       "lib/MyApp/Schema/UserRoles.pm":

           __PACKAGE__->belongs_to(role => 'MyApp::Schema::Roles', 'role_id');

MIGRATION
       If and when your application becomes complex enough that you need more
       features than SimpleDB gives you access to, you can migrate to a
       standard Catalyst Authentication configuration fairly easily.  SimpleDB
       simply creates a standard Auth config based on the inputs you give it.
       The config SimpleDB creates by default looks like this:

           MyApp->config('Plugin::Authentication') = {
               default => {
                   credential => {
                       class => 'Password',
                       password_type => 'clear'
                   },
                   store => {
                       class => 'DBIx::Class',
                       role_relation => 'roles',
                       role_field => 'role',
                       use_userdata_from_session => '1',
                       user_model => $user_model_from_simpledb_config
                       }
                   }
           };
