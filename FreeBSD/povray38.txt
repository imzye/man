NAME
       povray - POV-Ray: The Persistence of Vision Ray Tracer


SYNOPSIS
       povray [+Ooutput_file] [+/-option ...] [input_file]

       povray [+Iinput_file] [+Ooutput_file] [+/-option ...] [INI_file]


DESCRIPTION
       POV-Ray is a free, full-featured ray tracer, written and maintained by
       a team of volunteers on the Internet.  On the UNIX platform POV-Ray can
       be compiled with support for preview capabilities using the Simple
       DirectMedia Layer V1.2 library (https://www.libsdl.org).

       This manual page only lists the basic POV-Ray and UNIX specific
       features and command-line options for this version of POV-Ray.  For a
       complete description of the features of POV-Ray and its scene
       description language (a.k.a. POV-Ray SDL), or for a better explanation
       of the meaning of the command-line and INI file options, please consult
       the online documentation at
       http://wiki.povray.org/content/Documentation:Contents or the
       documentation capture that should accompany all versions of POV-Ray.
       The documentation is installed in PREFIX/share/doc/povray-3.8, where
       PREFIX is /usr/local by default, or a path specified when configuring
       the source package for compilation and installation.

       http://www.povray.org

       Some of the UNIX-specific features are:

              ASCII graphics in the text-mode version allow a basic view of
              the current rendering on text-only terminals.

              An interrupt handler allows rendering to be interrupted in a
              safe way, so that any data not currently written to disk will be
              saved before exiting.  Control-C or SIGINT will cause a user
              abort, and save the current rendering, before exiting.  See
              kill(1) for more information.

              Platform and architecture-independent rendering means that the
              same scene will render in the same way on all computers and
              operating systems (with the exception of the rendering speed, of
              course).


OPTIONS
       Options can be specified with either a leading '+' or a leading '-'.
       Many options are switches, meaning a '+' turns the option on, and a '-'
       turns the option off.  For other options, it doesn't matter if a '+' or
       a '-' is used.  Most options cannot have spaces in them so you should
       specify +FN rather than +F N, and combining options is not allowed, so
       +SC is very different from +S +C.  Options are not case sensitive.

       The command-line options are shown below with their corresponding INI
       file options.  If the same option is specified multiple times, whether
       in INI files or on the command-line, the last such option overrides any
       previous ones, with the exception of the +L or Library_Path option,
       which is cumulative.


   Parsing options:
       I<input_file_name> or Input_File_Name=file
              Specifies the input file to use.  If the input file name is '-',
              the scene description will be read from the standard input.  The

       HI<header_include_file_name> or Include_Header=file
              Specifies a file as the first include file of a scene file.
              This can be used to always include a specific set of default
              include files used by all your scenes.

       L<library_path> or Library_Path=path
              Specifies a directory to search for input files, include files,
              fonts, and image maps, if the specified file is not in the
              current directory.  This may be specified multiple times to
              increase the number of directories to search.

       MVn.n or Version=float
              Treat scene files as if they were version n.n instead of the
              current version.  This may be overridden from within the scene
              file.

       SU or Split_Unions=bool
              Split bounded CSG unions if children are finite.  This allows
              automatic bounding of CSG objects to take place.

       UR or Remove_Bounds=bool
              Remove unnecessary bounding objects.  This allows automatic
              bounding of older scene files to take place.

       BM1 or Bounding_Method=1
              Enable BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy) bounding (the default).

       BM2 or Bounding_Method=2
              Enable BSP (Binary Space Partitioning) tree bounding.

   Output options:
       Hn or Height=integer
              The image should be n pixels high.

       Wn or Width=integer
              The image should be n pixels wide.

       SRn or Start_Row=integer
              Start the rendering at row n from the top of the screen.

       SR0.n or Start_Row=float
              Start the rendering n percent from the top of the screen.

       ERn or End_Row=integer
              End the rendering at row n from the top of the screen.

       ER0.n or End_Row=float
              End the rendering at n percent from the top of the screen.

       SCn or Start_Column=integer
              Start the rendering at column n from the left of the screen.

       SC0.n or Start_Column=float
              Start the rendering at n percent from the left of the screen.

       ECn or Start_Column=integer
              End the rendering at column n from the left of the screen.

       EC0.n or Start_Column=float
              End the rendering at n percent from the left of the screen.

       C or Continue_Trace=bool

              closing the window.

       V or Verbose=bool
              Output verbose status messages on the progress of the rendering.

              available. If no image output option specified, output defaults
              to (PNG).

       O<output_file> or Output_File_Name=file

       >1 if serioues trouble (e.g. Sementation fault).


FILES
       POV-Ray for UNIX allows a povray.ini file in the current directory to
       override the individual setting in $HOME/.povray/3.8/povray.ini.
       POV-Ray looks for initial configuration information, like the
       Library_Path settings, which gives the location for the standard
       include files, first in the environment variable $POVINI, then in
       ./povray.ini, then in $HOME/.povray/3.8/povray.ini, then in
       PREFIX/etc/povray/3.8/povray.ini. The PREFIX directory can be changed
       at compile-time using the --prefix option of the configure script.  For
       backward compatibility with POV-Ray version 3.5 and earlier, the
       $HOME/.povrayrc and $PREFIX/etc/povray.ini files are also searched for
       when none of the above files were found.

       Since version 3.5 POV-Ray features an I/O Restriction mechanism.  I/O
       Restrictions attempt to at least partially protect a machine running
       POV-Ray from having files read or written outside of a given set of
       directories. The settings are defined in two configuration files, a
       system-level PREFIX/etc/povray/3.8/povray.conf file and an user-level
       $HOME/.povray/3.8/povray.conf file with more restrictive settings.  As
       of POV-Ray v3.6 the format of these configuration files has changed,
       and no backward compatibility is retained with the configuration files
       in POV-Ray 3.5. See the documentation for further details and examples
       of I/O Restriction settings.

       fixed. There are a large number of POV-Ray users on the POV-Ray
       newsserver news.povray.org availble by a web interface at:
       http://news.povray.org/groups. You should try to find help and
