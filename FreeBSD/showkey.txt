SHOWKEY(1)                                                          SHOWKEY(1)

NAME
       showkey - echo raw keystrokes back at you in a printable form

SYNOPSIS
       showkey

DESCRIPTION
       This program puts your terminal in raw mode, eats keystrokes, and
       prints them back it you in a recognizable printed form. It will be
       useful if you’re not certain what various keyboard keys are sending.

       Non-printables (and whitespace) ASCII characters are displayed as
       cookies surrounded by < >. The cookie will always contain an ASCII
       mnemonic (NUL, SOH, STX, ETX, EOT, ENQ, ACK, BEL, BS, HT, LF, VT, FF,
       CR, SO, SI, DLE, DC1, DC2, DC3, DC4, NAK, SYN, ETB, CAN, EM, SUB, ESC,
       FS, GS, RS, US, SP) and may also contain a control-key formula.

       Characters with the high bit set are shown as <ALT-xxx>, where xxx is
       generated as previously described.

       You terminate the program with your shell interrupt or quit characters.

BUGS
       Under some (but not all) X window managers you may see the following
       message: "Couldn’t get a file descriptor referring to the console".  If
       this happens, go root and try again.
