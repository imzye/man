UNSTOW(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              UNSTOW(1)

NAME
     unstow – unstow packages much faster than stow -D

SYNOPSIS
     unstow [-nv] [-d stow_dir] [-t target_dir] packages ...

DESCRIPTION
     The unstow command is a utility to unstow packages.  It performs much
     faster than “stow -D” because unstow searches a package directory for
     stowed files while stow(1) searches the target directory for matching
     symlinks.

CAVEATS
     unstow does not check if a symlink to be removed points to a file of the
     named package, so please double check if you are specifying the correct
     package.

OPTIONS
     The following command line arguments are supported:

     -h      Show the help screen and exit.

     -V      Show Unstow and Stow version numbers and exit.

     -n      Do not actually make changes.

     -v      Be verbose.

     -d DIR  Set stow dir to DIR (default is current dir).

     -t DIR  Set target to DIR (default is parent of stow dir).

HISTORY
     The unstow utility was written in around 2008 and first released on
     December 2009.
