DATA STRUCTURES
     The device dependent mechanisms for handling packet transmit and receive
     are primarily defined by the functions named above.  The if_pkt_info data
     structure contains statistics and identifying info necessary for packet
     transmission.  While the data structure for packet receipt is the
     if_rxd_info structure.

   The if_pkt_info Structure
     The fields of struct if_pkt_info are as follows:

           ipi_len              (uint32_t) Denotes the size of packet to be
                                sent on the transmit queue.

           ipi_segs             (bus_dma_segment_t *) A pointer to the
                                bus_dma_segment of the device independent
                                transfer queue defined in iflib.

           ipi_qsidx            Unique index value assigned sequentially to
                                each transmit queue.  Used to reference the
                                currently transmitting queue.

           ipi_nsegs            (uint16_t) Number of descriptors to be read
                                into the device dependent transfer
                                descriptors.

           ipi_ndescs           (uint16_t) Number of descriptors in use.
                                Calculated by subtracting the old pidx value
                                from the new pidx value.

           ipi_flags            (uint16_t) Flags defined on a per packet
                                basis.

           ipi_pidx             (uint32_t) Value of first pidx sent to the
                                isc_encap function for encapsulation and
                                subsequent transmission.

           ipi_new_pidx         (uint32_t) Value set after the termination of
                                the isc_encap function.  This value will
                                become the first pidx sent to the isc-encap
                                the next time that the function is called.

                                If value >= 0 then it is the freelist id

FUNCTIONS
     All function calls are associated exclusively with either packet
     transmission or receipt.  The void *sc passed as the first argument to
     all of the following functions represents the driver's softc.

   Transmit Packet Functions
           isc_txd_encap()
           Transmit function that sends a packet on an interface.  The
           if_pkt_info data structure contains data information fields
           describing the packet.  This function returns 0 if successful,
           otherwise an error value is returned.

           isc_txd_flush()
           Flush function is called immediately after the isc_txd_encap
           function transmits a packet.  It updates the hardware producer
           index or increments the descriptors used to pidx_or_credits in the
           queue designated by the qid number.  This is often referred to as
           poking the doorbell register.

           isc_txd_credits_update()
           Credit function advances the buffer ring and calculates the credits
           (descriptors) processed.  Until the I/O is complete it cleans the
           range in case of multisegments and updates the count of processed
           packets.  The function returns the number of processed credits.

   Receive Packet Functions
           isc_rxd_available()
           Function calculates the remaining number of descriptors from a
           position given by idx.  The function returns this value.

           isc_rxd_refill()
           Starting with the physical address paddrs, the function reads a
           packet into the rx_ring until a value designated by count is
           reached.  vaddrs is typically not needed and is provided for
           devices that place their own metadata in the packet header.

           isc_rxd_flush()
           Flush function updates the producer pointer on the free list flid
           in queue set number qid to pidx to reflect the presence of new
           buffers.

           isc_rxd_pkt_get()
           Process a single software descriptor.  rxr->rx_base[i] contains a
           descriptor that describes a received packet.  Hardware specific
           information about the buffer referred to by ri is returned in the
           data structure if_rxd_info
