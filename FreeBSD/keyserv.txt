KEYSERV(8)              FreeBSD System Manager's Manual             KEYSERV(8)

NAME
     keyserv – server for storing private encryption keys

SYNOPSIS
     keyserv [-d] [-D] [-n] [-p path] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
     The keyserv utility is a daemon that is used for storing the private
     encryption keys of each user logged into the system.  These encryption
     keys are used for accessing secure network services such as secure NFS.

     Normally, root's key is read from the file /etc/.rootkey when the daemon
     is started.  This is useful during power-fail reboots when no one is
     around to type a password.

     If a client with no secret key calls keyserv, then the key of user nobody
     is used instead as the default key.

     The following options are available:

     -d      Disable the use of default keys for nobody.

     -D      Run in debugging mode and log all requests to keyserv.

     -n      Root's secret key is not read from /etc/.rootkey.  Instead,
             keyserv prompts the user for the password to decrypt root's key
             stored in the /etc/publickey database and then stores the
             decrypted key in /etc/.rootkey for future use.  This option is
             useful if the /etc/.rootkey file ever gets out of date or
             corrupted.

     -p path
             Specify where to search for libdes.so.3.  Default is /usr/lib.

     -v      Display status of DES support (enabled/disabled).

FILES
     /etc/.rootkey
     /usr/lib/libdes.so.3
