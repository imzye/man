POE::Component::Client::Ident(3)           User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       POE::Component::Client::Ident - A component that provides non-blocking
       ident lookups to your sessions.

SYNOPSIS
          use POE::Component::Client::Ident;

          my $poco_obj = POE::Component::Client::Ident->spawn ( 'Ident-Client' );

          $kernel->post ( 'Ident-Client' => query => Socket => $socket );

          $kernel->post ( 'Ident-Client' => query => PeerAddr => '10.0.0.1',
                                                     PeerPort => 2345,
                                                     SockAddr => '192.168.1.254',
                                                     SockPort => 6669,
                                                     BuggyIdentd => 1,
                                                     TimeOut => 30 );

DESCRIPTION
       POE::Component::Client::Ident is a POE component that provides non-
       blocking Ident lookup services to other components and sessions. The
       Ident protocol is described in RFC 1413
       <http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1413.html>.

       The component takes requests in the form of events, spawns
       POE::Component::Client::Ident::Agent sessions to perform the Ident
       queries and returns the appropriate responses to the requesting
       session.

CONSTRUCTOR
       "spawn"
           Takes one argument, a kernel alias to christen the new component
           with.

           Returns an object.

METHODS
       These methods are available on the poco object returned by spawn().

       "session_id"
           Returns the component's session ID.

       "shutdown"
           Takes no arguments. Causes the component to terminate gracefully.
           Any pending Ident::Agent components that are running will be closed
           without returning events.

INPUT
       The component accepts the following events:

       "query"
           Takes either the arguments:

             "PeerAddr", the remote IP address where a TCP connection has originated;
             "PeerPort", the port where the TCP has originated from;
             "SockAddr", the address of our end of the connection;
             "SockPort", the port of our end of the connection;

           OR:

             "Socket", the socket handle of the connection, the component will work out all
             the details for you. If Socket is defined, it will override the settings of the
             other arguments.

           See the documentation for Ident-Agent for extra parameters you may
           pass.

       "shutdown"
           Takes no arguments. Causes the component to terminate gracefully.
           Any pending Ident::Agent components that are running will be closed
           without returning events.

OUTPUT
       The events you can expect to receive having submitted a 'query'.

       All the events returned by the component have a hashref as ARG0. This
       hashref contains the arguments that were passed to the component. If a
       socket handle was passed, the hashref will contain the appropriate
       PeerAddr, PeerPort, SockAddr and Sock Port.

       "ident_client_reply"
           Returned when the component receives a USERID response from the
           identd. ARG0 is hashref, ARG1 is the opsys field and ARG2 is the
           userid or something else depending on whether the opsys field is
           set to 'OTHER' ( Don't blame me, read the RFC ).

       "ident_client_error"
           Returned when the component receives an ERROR response from the
           identd, there was some sort of communication error with the remote
           host ( ie. no identd running ) or it had some other problem with
           making the connection to the other host. No matter.  ARG0 is
           hashref, ARG1 is the type of error.
