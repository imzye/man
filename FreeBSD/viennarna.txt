NAME
       AnalyseDists - Analyse a distance matrix

SYNOPSIS
       AnalyseDists [-X[swn]]

DESCRIPTION
       AnalyseDists reads a distance matrix (given as lower triangle matrix)
       from stdin and writes a split decomposition and a cluster analysis of
       this distance matrix to stdout.  The line before the distance matrix
       must be of the form
       > Y x [comments]
       where 'x' gives the number of taxa, 'Y' is a single character that
       indicates the type of distance and 'comment' is an arbitrary comment.
       This matches the output format of, e.g., RNAdistance.  The input data
       file may contain arbitrary lines before and after the distance matrix.
       All lines beginning with '> ' that are not of the above form are
       written to stdout. The program continues reading until it encounters an
       EOF condition or the terminator character '@'.
       A list of taxa names can be specified in the input stream. The list
       must begin with a line of the form
       * [fname]
       if fname is present, it will be used to name the postscript output
       files.  The entries have the form 'x : Taxon', where x is the number of
       taxon, i.e., the corresponding row and column of the distance matrix.
       The taxa list need not be complete. It must end however with a line
       beginning with '*' or any of the separator characters. The taxa list is
       printed on top of the output.


OPTIONS
       -X[swn]
              specifies the analysis methods to be used.

       [s]    Split decomposition.

       [w]    Cluster analysis using Ward's method. A PostScript file named
              '[fname_]wards.ps' is created containing a drawing of the tree.

       [n]    Cluster analysis using Saitou's neighbour joining method.  A
              PostScript file named '[fname_]nj.ps' is created containing a
              drawing of the tree.


REFERENCES
       The method of split decomposition was proposed by H.J. Bandelt and
       A.W.M. Dress (Adv Math, 92:1992,47).
       The variance method for cluster analysis is due to H.J. Ward.  (J Amer
       Stat Ass, 58:1963,236).
       The neighbour joining method was published by Saitou and Nei (Mol Biol
       Evol, 4:1987,406).
