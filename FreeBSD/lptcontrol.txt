LPTCONTROL(8)           FreeBSD System Manager's Manual          LPTCONTROL(8)

NAME
     lptcontrol – a utility for manipulating the lpt printer driver

SYNOPSIS
     lptcontrol -e | -i | -p | -s [-d control_device]

DESCRIPTION
     The lptcontrol utility is used to set either the interrupt-driven,
     extended, standard, or polling mode of individual lpt(4) devices.  When a
     printer is switched from a mode to another, this change will only take
     effect the next time the device is opened.

     Extended mode is anything the parallel port interface can support.  For
     an ECP/ISA parallel port, it may be FIFO+DMA or ECP.

     The following command line options are supported:

     -e      Turn on extended mode.

     -i      Turn on interrupt-driven mode.

     -p      Turn on polled mode.

     -s      Turn on standard mode, i.e., turn off extended mode.

     -d control_device
             Set the mode of the printer control device specified by
             control_device.  The default value for control_device is
             /dev/lpt0.ctl.

     One of -e, -i, -p or -s must be specified.

BUGS
     The control device name should never have been an option, but should have
     been an optional argument.  Because of this, a single argument is treated
     as a device name.
