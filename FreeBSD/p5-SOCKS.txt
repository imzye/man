NAME
       Net::SOCKS - a SOCKS client class

SYNOPSIS
        Establishing a connection:

        my $sock = new Net::SOCKS(socks_addr => '192.168.1.3',
                       socks_port => 1080,
                       user_id => 'the_user',
                       user_password => 'the_password',
                       force_nonanonymous => 1,
                       protocol_version => 5);

        # connect to finger port and request finger information for some_user
        my $f= $sock->connect(peer_addr => '192.168.1.3', peer_port => 79);
        print $f "some_user\n";    # example writing to socket
        while (<$f>) { print }     # example reading from socket
        $sock->close();

        Accepting an incoming connection:

        my $sock = new Net::SOCKS(socks_addr => '192.168.1.3',
                       socks_port => 1080,
                       user_id => 'the_user',
                       user_password => 'the_password',
                       force_nonanonymous => 1,
                       protocol_version => 5);

        my ($ip, $ip_dot_dec, $port) = $sock->bind(peer_addr => "128.10.10.11",
                               peer_port => 9999);

        $f= $sock->accept();
        print $f "Hi!  Type something.\n";    # example writing to socket
        while (<$f>) { print }                # example reading from socket
        $sock->close();

DESCRIPTION
        my $sock = new Net::SOCKS(socks_addr => '192.168.1.3',
                       socks_port => 1080,
                       user_id => 'the_user',
                       user_password => 'the_password',
                       force_nonanonymous => 1,
                       protocol_version => 5);

         To connect to a SOCKS server, specify the SOCKS server's
         hostname, port number, SOCKS protocol version, username, and
         password.  Username and password are optional if you plan
         to use a SOCKS server that doesn't require any authentication.
         If you would like to force the connection to be
         nonanoymous, set the force_nonanonymous parameter.

        my $f= $sock->connect(peer_addr => '192.168.1.3', peer_port => 79);

        To connect to another machine using SOCKS, use the connect method.
        Specify the host and port number as parameters.

        my ($ip, $ip_dot_dec, $port) = $sock->bind(peer_addr => "192.168.1.3",
                               peer_port => 9999);

         If you wanted to accept a connection with SOCKS, specify the host
         and port of the machine you expect a connection from.  Upon
         success, bind() returns the ip address and port number that
         the SOCKS server is listening at on your behalf.

        $f= $sock->accept();

         If a call to bind() returns a success status code SOCKS_OKAY,
         a call to the accept() method will return when the peer host
         connects to the host/port that was returned by the bind() method.
         Upon success, accept() returns SOCKS_OKAY.

        $sock->close();

         Closes the connection.
