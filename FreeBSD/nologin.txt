NOLOGIN(8)              FreeBSD System Manager's Manual             NOLOGIN(8)

NAME
     nologin – politely refuse a login

SYNOPSIS
     nologin

DESCRIPTION
     The nologin is intended as a replacement shell field for accounts that
     have been disabled.

     When executed, nologin first writes about the login attempt to syslog(3)
     and then displays a message that an account is not available.

     To disable all logins, investigate nologin(5).

EXIT STATUS
     The nologin utility always exits non-zero.

EXAMPLES
     Here is a demonstration of executing nologin:

         $ nologin
         This account is currently not available.
         $ tail -n 1 /var/log/messages
