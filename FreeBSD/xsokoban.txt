NAME
       xsokoban - Pushing objects around...

SYNOPSIS
       xsokoban [{ -nn | -s[level] | -r | -u <username> -c[scorefile-text]} -C
       -display <disp> {-w | -walls} {-rv | -reverse} {-f | -font} <fn> {-b |
       -bitdir} <path> {-fg | -foreground} <color> {-bg | -background} <color>
       {-bd | -border} <color> {-pr | -pointer} <color> -xrm <arg> ]

DESCRIPTION
       xsokoban is an implementation of the game sokoban, written on top of
       X(1).

       The goal of xsokoban is to push all the round objects into the score
       area of each level using the mouse or the arrow keys. The arrow keys
       move the player in the corresponding direction, pushing an object if it
       is in the way and there is a clear space on the other side. The mouse
       buttons each have a distinct function.

       If the left mouse button is pressed on a clear square, the player will
       move to that location via the optimal path if such a path exists;
       otherwise, the game will beep.

       If the middle button is pressed on an object that is adjacent to the
       player, the object will be pushed one step.  If the middle mouse button
       is pressed on an empty space, the player will move the closest object
       that is on a straight line with the destination, such that the object
       can be pushed in that direction, and the player is not directly between
       the destination and the object.  Before pushing the object, the player
       is moved optimally to start the push.

       Either the left or middle mouse buttons may be used to "drag" an object
       from an initial to a final position. If a straightforward way exists
       for the player to push the object without moving any other objects, the
       player will execute appropriate moves and pushes to get the object to
       the desired destination.

       The right button mouse undoes the last user action, and may be used any
       number of times.


       The rest of the functions are bound to the keyboard:

       ?       Display the help screen.

       q       Quit the current level.

       h,j,k,l Move the man just like the arrow keys, as in vi(1).

       s       Save and quit.

       u       Undo the last action. Same as right mouse button.

       U       Restart a level.

       c       Snapshot the current position

       ^U      Restore to the last snapshot

       ^R      Redraw the screen.

       S       View the score file.


       The score file can be viewed at any time during the playing of the
       game.  The scores are also displayed whenever a level is completed.
       Scores of the current user are initially highlighted. While viewing
       scores, the following keys may be used to control the listing:


       q       Quit the game

       Return  Return to the game and continue with the current level; or, if
               the current level is completed, begin the next level.

       <left>  The left mouse button may be used to select a different user to
               highlight. It also controls the scroll bar at the right side of
               the screen.

       <middle>
               The middle mouse button selects a new level to play if a level
               is not already in progress.


       Scores are saved in the score file if they are of high enough rank. A
       score is ranked according to how many scores are better than it; there
       are no scores superior to a rank 1 score, only one score superior to a
       rank 2 score, and so on. If two scores are identical, the first one
       entered is ranked higher.

       It is possible for other users to have the same username as you, and
       thus collide in the score file. One symptom of this problem is that
       when you first play the game, you are not started at level 1.  To avoid
       this problem, set your "xsokoban.username" X resource to the desired
       unique username.


OPTIONS
       -nn     Start at level nn, provided that levels below it are completed.

       -s [level]
               Print the scores on standard output. The optional level will
               restrict the printout to scores on just that level.

       -r      Restore a saved game.

       -u <username>
               Set the name of the user playing the game. By default, the
               user's login name is used.

       -c [scorefile-text]
               Create a new score file (can be ran only by the owner of the
               game).  If the argument "scorefile-text" is supplied, the file
               of that name is assumed to contain the textual output
               compatible with the output of "xsokoban -s -D". The scorefile
               is initialized to contain the scores described in that text
               file. If no argument is supplied, the score file is initialized
               to be empty.

       -C      Create a new X colormap for display purposes. Ordinarily
               xsokoban creates a new colormap automatically if the default
               colormap does not contain enough free slots to allow it to run
               properly.

       -display <display>
               Run the game on the named display.

       {-w | -walls}
               Use fancy walls. (This is the default unless an option bitmap
               set is used)

       {-rv | -reverse}
               Use reverse video.

       {-f | -font} <fontname>
               Use the named font instead of the default 9x15 font.

       {-b | -bitdir} <path>
               Use the bitmaps found in <path> instead of the defaults.

       {-fg | -foreground} <color>
               Use the named color as the foreground color. (default is
               BlackPixel())

       {-bg | -background} <color>
               Use the named color as the background color. (default is
               WhitePixel())

       {-bd | -border} <color>
               Use the named color as the border color. (default is foreground
               color)

       {-pr | -pointer} <color>
               Use the named color as the mouse pointer foreground. (default
               is foreground)

       -xrm <arg>
               <arg> is an X Resource specification.

RESOURCES
       xsokoban understands the following resources.

       username : string
               The name you would like to use when playing xsokoban. It
               defaults to your real username. If you are playing in WWW mode,
               some domain information is appended to your real username to
               disambiguate from other users with the same name. This domain
               information is not appended to the username if specified
               through the resource.

       fancyWalls : boolean
               Use fancy walls.

SPECIAL BITMAPS
       In order to define your own bitmaps for xsokoban you only need to know
       the names of which files it is looking for.  The standard bitmap files
       are:

       man.xbm -- The player bitmap.

       goal.xbm
               -- The goal area bitmap.

       wall.xbm
               -- The standard wall bitmap.

       object.xbm
               -- The object that gets pushed.

       treasure.xbm
               -- The bitmap for the object when it is on the goal.

       saveman.xbm
               -- The bitmap for the player when it is on the goal.

       To use the fancy walls option, you need the following additional files.

       lonewall.xbm
               -- a wall with connections on no sides.

       southwall.xbm
               -- a wall with only northern connections

       northwall.xbm
               -- a wall with only southern connections

       eastwall.xbm
               -- a wall with only western connections

       westwall.xbm
               -- a wall with only eastern connections

       llcornerwall.xbm
               -- a wall with northern and eastern connections

       ulcornerwall.xbm
               -- a wall with southern and eastern connections

       lrcornerwall.xbm
               -- a wall with northern and western connections

       urcornerwall.xbm
               -- a wall with southern and western connections

       north_twall.xbm
               -- a wall with connections on all BUT northern side

       south_twall.xbm
               -- a wall with connections on all BUT southern side

       east_twall.xbm
               -- a wall with connections on all BUT eastern side

       west_twall.xbm
               -- a wall with connections on all BUT western side

       centerwall.xbm
               -- A wall will connections on all four sides.

BUGS
       Auto bitmap resizing code doesn't take into account font sizes.
       Feedback on user error is poor (only beeps).
