YDOTOOL(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             YDOTOOL(1)

NAME
       ydotool - command-line /dev/uinput automation tool

SYNOPSIS
       ydotool cmd args

       ydotool cmd --help

DESCRIPTION
       ydotool lets you programmatically (or manually) simulate keyboard input
       and mouse activity, etc. The ydotoold(8) daemon must be running.

       Currently implemented command(s):

       type
           Type a string
       key
           Press keys
       mousemove
           Move mouse pointer to absolute position
       click
           Click on mouse buttons

KEYBOARD COMMANDS
       key [-d,--key-delay <ms>] [<KEYCODE:PRESSED> ...]

           Type a given keycode.

           e.g. 28:1 28:0 means pressing on the Enter button on a standard US
           keyboard. (where :1 for pressed means the key is down and then :0
           means the key is released)

           42:1 38:1 38:0 24:1 24:0 38:1 38:0 42:0 - "LOL"

           Non-interpretable values, such as 0, aaa, l0l, will only cause a
           delay.

           See `/usr/include/linux/input-event-codes.h' for available key
           codes (KEY_*).

           You can find the key name/number your keyboard is sending to
           libinput by running `sudo libinput record` and then selecting your
           keyboard from the list it will show you the libinput proper key
           name and number for each key you press.

           Options: -d,--key-delay <ms>
               Delay time between keystrokes. Default 12ms.

       type [-D,--next-delay <ms>] [-d,--key-delay <ms>] [-f,--file
       <filepath>] "text"

           Types text as if you had typed it on the keyboard.

           Options:

           -d,--key-delay <ms>
               Delay time between key events (up/down each). Default 12ms.

           -D,--next-delay <ms>
               Delay between strings. Default 0ms.

           -f,--file <filepath>
               Specify a file, the contents of which will be typed as if
               passed as an argument. The filepath may also be '-' to read
               from stdin.

           Example: to type 'Hello world!' you would do:
               ydotool type 'Hello world!'

MOUSE COMMANDS
       mousemove [-a,--absolute] <x> <y>
           Move the mouse to the relative X and Y coordinates on the screen.

           Options: --absolute
               Use absolute position

           Example: to move the cursor to absolute coordinates (100,100):
               ydotool mousemove --absolute 100 100

       click [-d,--next-delay <ms>] [-r,--repeat N ] [button ...]
           Send a click.

           Options: -d,--next-delay <ms>
               Delay between input events (up/down, a compete click means
               doubled time). Default 25ms.

           -r,--repeat N
               Repeat entire sequence N times

           all mouse buttons are represented using hexadecimal numeric values,
           with an optional bit mask to specify if mouse up/down needs to be
           omitted.

           •   0x00 - LEFT
           •   0x01 - RIGHT
           •   0x02 - MIDDLE
           •   0x03 - SIDE
           •   0x04 - EXTR
           •   0x05 - FORWARD
           •   0x06 - BACK
           •   0x07 - TASK
           •   0x40 - Mouse down
           •   0x80 - Mouse up

       Examples:

           •   0x00: chooses left button, but does nothing (you can use this
               to implement extra sleeps)
           •   0xC0: left button click (down then up)
           •   0x41: right button down
           •   0x82: middle button up

           The '0x' prefix can be omitted if you want.
