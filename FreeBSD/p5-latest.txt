NAME
       latest - Use the latest Perl features

VERSION
       This document describes latest version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
         use latest;

DESCRIPTION
       The line

         use latest;

       is roughly equivalent to

         use strict;
         use warnings;
         use $];

       except that 'use $]' doesn't work.

       The main use case is to

         use latest;

       at the top of your tests to shake out any obscure problems that might
       result from your code being used by a program that requires the latest
       Perl version.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
       latest requires no configuration files or environment variables.

DEPENDENCIES
       None.

INCOMPATIBILITIES
       None reported.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       Please report any bugs or feature requests to "bug-latest@rt.cpan.org",
