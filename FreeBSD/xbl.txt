DESCRIPTION
       Xbl is a game involving dropping blocks like Xtetris but in 3
       dimensions.  As they drop you can move them with numeric key pad (if
       you have), cursor key or rotate other 3 axis in 2 directions (6 other
       keys).  Space key for dropping quickly and 'p' key for pause.  All the
       possible keys are displayed in menu window.

       Points are scored for each block that comes to rest on the gradually
       building up pile of blocks.  When the pile reaches the top of the
       screen and no further blocks can be dropped the game ends. When a stage
       of blocks across the 3D matrix is completely filled, that stage is
       removed and all the blocks above are dropped down.  As more stages are
       deleted the blocks fall faster.

       There is one high score table by size of matrix and pieces types.

       For your information, another 3D tetris exists, its name is spatial.  A
       sphere packing game also exists; its name is spheral.  For these two
       games, contact Andrew Plotkin ( ap1i@andrew.cmu.edu ) or you can
       retrieve the file threedee.tar.Z somewhere in the world...

       An enhanced HTML version of this manual is in our computer (in the same
       directory than scores).  If you can't find it, use the networked
       version: http://www710.univ-lyon1.fr/ftp/xbl/xbl-man.html



OPTIONS
       The next options can only be set when the game starts.


       -display hostname:0.0
              Gives the display name.

       -geometry geometry_string

       -scoregeometry geometry_string

       -zoogeometry geometry_string

       -menugeometry geometry_string
              Gives the geometry of the play, score, zoo and menu window.

       -help  Displays the options, possible values and current values.

       -verbose
              Displays various things for debugging.

       -colormap
              Creates its own colormap even if unnecessary.

       -visual
              On screen with multiple visual, it search the best one to use.
              In this case it does not use the default visual.

       -bw    Displays in black and white even on color display.

       -buffer 0...5
              Chooses the buffering method for animation.  Each method uses
              resources.  Speed of buffering method is hardware dependent.
              Perfect methods are 2,1 and 3, choose the fast one.


       -font font_name
              Chooses font for menus, score window...


       -bigfont font_name
              Chooses a big font for menu (the score and high score)


       -buttonheight -1...16
              The height of 3D buttons.  If your display is slow use small
              button.  The -1 choice is half the height of the font.


       -color 0...6
              Background color for menu window.
              0:Black
              1:Red
              2:Green
              3:Yellow
              4:Blue
              5:Magenta
              6:Cyan


       -sync  Uses X Synchronise. Only for debugging.


       -clearline 0...1
              If 0, clears line with rectangle filling; otherwise with a black
              line.  It's useful with some X servers that don't draw the same
              segment with the same pixels. Another method to avoid this
              problem is to use a linewidth equal to 1, though in this case
              drawing is slower.


       -linewidth 0...16
              Thickness of the moving block lines.


       -fps 1...100
              Number of frames by second.  If it is set too high, the display
              might be jumpy.  If set to 0, the game runs at maximum speed.


       -time_to_demo 1...999
              Number of seconds before the automatic demonstration.


       -speedtest
              This option helps you to find the fastest buffering mode.


       -stat  Statistics on launched blocks, they are displayed at the end of
              the game.


       -keytable keys_list
              A 19 characters list in the order (D=Down L=Left R=Right U=Up) :
              Translations:DL,L,UL,U,UR,R,DR,D
              Rotations:   RX+,RX-,RY+,RY-,RZ+,RZ-
              Others:      LaunchBloc CancelGame SuspendGame QuitGame
              Drop1Level
              Don't forgot ' if there are special characters.


       Next options can be changed while game is running.


       -keyboard 0...5
              This switch chooses keyboard type :
              0:Use key table, given by -keytable
              1:AZERTY|
              2:QWERTY|
              3:AZERTY-
              4:QWERTY-
              5:SPATIAL
              SPATIAL is the set of keys of the other 3D tetris : spatial


       -zoo   Displays the zoo (all possible pieces) when game starts.


       -score Displays the score table when game starts.


       -draw 0 or 2
              Draw mode. 0 for wire frame piece and 2 for transparent pieces.
              On slow host, 0 is necessary.


       -x  3...8  -y  3...8  -z  6...18"
              World size : width, height, depth.


       -smooth
              Starts game with smooth drawing.


       -training
              In this mode, pieces don't fall.  By the way scores are not
              saved.


       -shownext
              Next piece is shown.  By the way score are multiplied by 0.7


       -level 0...10
              Level 0 is slow, 10 is unplayable.  This option chooses the
              starting game level.  Level game increases during game.


       -bloctype 0...2
              0 : Only flat pieces.
              1 : Some 3D pieces.
              2 : All possible pieces with less or equal than 5 cubes.


       -land 0...2
              0 : Small land (3x3x15)
              1 : Big land (5x5x10)
              2 : User land (as defined by options)


       -eyedistance -1...1
              If not 0 the game is with real 3D. But you need to cross-eye (or
              the opposite). The value is positive if your right eye look the
              left image et the left eye look the right one.  Indicate a
              negative value to swap the two images.


FILES
       /usr/local/lib/xbl
              Directory which contains the score tables and COPYING file (FSF
              GPL)

       /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Xbl
              Defaults for Xbl, this file only contains a data: the option
              line for Xbl.
              xbl*args: -x 5 -y 5 -z 10 -level 0 \
                        -bloctype 2 -land 0 \
                        -draw 2 -smooth -buffer -1 \
                        -keyboard 4 \
                        -keytable '14789632azqswx ^[p^C0'



ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       XBLOPTIONS
              Xbl will search his options in this variable, you can put :
              XBLOPTIONS='-smooth -draw 0' export XBLOPTIONS
              in your .profile or .login file.


BUGS
       If sometime a block fall multiple level at once it indicates that your
       fps is set too high.

       SOUND isn't correct on some X server, no possible correction.

       FLICKING DISPLAY on some X server that doesn't handle XSync correctly.
       You can turn around using : -buffer 2

       DIRTY POINT on screen because some X servers don't draw the same pixels
       for the same segment. You can turn around using : -clearline 0 or
       -linewidth 1

       FOCUS WINDOW doesn't work with OpenWin, so put the cursor in the game
       window.

       DEMO mode seems to cheat (blocs going through other blocs) but it is
       because the visualization show a direct way (it sums all the
       transformations up).  In fact, the real way could use very complex and
       tortuous indirect path.
