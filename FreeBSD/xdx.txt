NAME
       Xdx - TCP/IP DX-cluster client for Amateur Radio

SYNOPSIS
       xdx [-c cty.dat] [-h] [-V]

DESCRIPTION
       Xdx is a DX-cluster client for the X Window System which shows a list
       of DX announcements and a separate list of WWV, WCY, “To ALL” and other
       server messages in a single X11 window.  Xdx uses the telnet protocol
       to connect to a DX-Cluster host via TCP/IP.  While host connections are
       most commonly made via the Internet, any medium capable of carrying
       TCP/IP, such as packet radio, may be used.  Host connection details are
       saved between sessions.

OPTIONS
       The following options are recognized by Xdx.

       -c cty.dat, --cty_dat=cty.dat
              Load a desired country data file.

              Country data files are used to determine the DX Century Club
              (DXCC) entity shown in the Country column.  Updated country
              files are available from country-files.com
              <http://www.country-files.com/cty/cty.dat> Although a country
              file is installed as a part of Xdx, it will quickly become out
              of date as updates are made available frequently.  Announcements
              of updated country files are sent to the Xdx mailing list.  See
              the BUGS section below for the mailing list address.

              See the ENVIRONMENT and FILES sections below for other methods
              of loading an updated country file.

       -h, --help
              Print short Xdx usage message detailing available options and
              exit.

       -V, --version
              Print Xdx version and short copyright information then exit.

ENVIRONMENT
       XDX_CTY
              If $XDX_CTY is set, its value is the location of the cty.dat
              file.  Using the -c option overrides this environment variable.

FILES
       $HOME/.xdx/cty.dat
              Xdx will load the country file found in the preferences
              directory, normally $HOME/.xdx, if the -c option is not given or
              the XDX_CTY environment variable is not set.  This is a
              convenient way to keep an up-to-date or custom cty.dat for use
              just with Xdx.
