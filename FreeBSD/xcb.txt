NAME
       xcb - X Cut Buffers - Pigeon holes for your cut and paste selections.

SYNOPSIS
       xcb [Xt option] [-l layout] [-n count] [-p|-s|-S list] [-r count]

DESCRIPTION
       Xcb provides easy access to the cut buffers built into every X server.
       It allows the buffers to be manipulated either via the command line, or
       with the mouse in a point and click manner.  The buffers can be used as
       holding pens to store and retrieve arbitrary data fragments.  Any
       number of cut buffers may be created, so any number of different pieces
       of data can be saved and recalled later.  By default, 8 cut buffers are
       created.  The program is designed primarily for use with textual data.

       Xcb has two modes of operation.  Normally xcb provides an array of
       windows on your display, one per cut buffer, tiled horizontally,
       vertically, or in some user specified layout.  Each window displays the
       contents of its respective cut buffer.  Data can be cut from and pasted
       to the windows in a similar manner to xterm.  The buffers can also be
       rotated.

       In task mode, xcb lets you access the cut buffers from the command
       line.  Cut buffers can be loaded from stdin, copied or concatenated to
       stdout, loaded using the current PRIMARY selection, or rotated an
       arbitrary number of positions.  In this mode of operation, xcb performs
       the requested task and then exits.  It does not create any windows and
       has no interaction with the mouse or keyboard.

OPTIONS
       Xcb supports the full set of X Toolkit Intrinsics options, as well as
       those listed below.  Xcb options can appear in any order.  The presence
       of the -p, -r, -s or -S options causes xcb to execute in task mode,
       described above.

       -l layout
              This option controls the geometry arrangement of xcb's
              subwindows.  It is the command line equivalent of the .layout
              resource, described below.

       -n count
              Create count cut buffers.  Count can be any integer greater than
              zero.  This option is the command line equivalent of the
              .bufferCount resource, described below.

       -u     Use utf-8 instead of the current locale settings when executing
              in task mode and doing I/O.

       -V     Print the xcb release version number and exit immediately.

       -p list
              Print the contents of the listed buffer(s) on stdout.  The
              buffered data is printed exactly as it is stored in the server.
              Selecting two or more buffers has the effect of concatenating
              the data on stdout.  The cut buffers are numbered from 0...
              onwards.  The list can be either a single digit, a comma
              separated list of digits, a range of the form m-n, or some
              combination of lists and ranges.  The buffers are printed in
              listed order, so repeated numbers in the list can be used to
              duplicate buffer contents.

       -r count
              Rotate the buffers by count positions.  Count can be any
              integer, positive or negative.  This option may be used in
              conjunction with the -n count option to rotate a specific number
              of buffers.  If the -n option is not used, xcb will rotate the
              number of buffers given by the .bufferCount resource.

       -s list
              Store the data from stdin in the listed buffer(s).  If the list
              refers to two or more buffers, the input data is duplicated in
              each buffer.  Refer to the -p option for the definition of a
              list.

       -S list
              Store the current PRIMARY selection data in the listed
              buffer(s).  The data is converted to a string representation.
              If the list refers to two or more buffers, the PRIMARY selection
              is duplicated in each buffer.  Refer to the -p option for the
              definition of a list.  Under the -S option xcb waits for the
              nominated cut buffer's contents to change before exiting.  If no
              change is detected within 3 seconds, xcb exits with a non-zero
              return code.

WIDGETS and RESOURCES
       The xcb widget hierarchy consists of a collection of custom buffer
       widgets, one per cut buffer.  In the Athena version of the program,
       these buffer widgets are all contained within a single Athena form
       widget.  In the Motif version of the program, they are each enclosed by
       Motif frame widgets, and the frame widgets are all contained within a
       single Motif RowColumn widget.

       The names of the buffer widgets are "buffer0", "buffer1", "buffer2",
       .... etc., and their class name is "Buffer".  Each buffer widget
       supports all the standard core widget resources, plus the .foreground
       and .fontSet resources.

       Application wide resources are as follows:

         .bufferCount (default value 8)
               This is the number of buffer widgets to create.
               Any number of widgets (greater than zero) can be created.

         .layout (default value "h")
               Only the first character of the resource value is significant.
               This is the geometry arrangement to apply in the container widget.
               The layout can be "h" (horizontal), "v" (vertical), or some
               other value to disable the inbuilt geometry code and specify
               the layout via your X resources.  An example is provided in the
               application default resources file.

EVENTS and TRANSLATIONS
       Xcb's input semantics are coded into a Toolkit translation table.  The
       default bindings have been chosen to conform with the default
       configuration of other cut and paste clients, such as xterm.  The
       bindings may be altered or overridden according to your needs.  The
       actions functions provided by xcb are:-

       cut()           causes the contents of the chosen cut buffer to become
                       the PRIMARY selection.  The window contents, if any,
                       are highlighted, and can then be pasted into other
                       cut buffers or applications.

       paste()         causes the value of the PRIMARY selection to be
                       converted into text and pasted into the chosen cut
                       buffer, overwriting any previous buffer contents.
                       If no PRIMARY selection is present, xcb pastes
                       the contents of cut buffer zero into the chosen buffer.

       clear()         clears the chosen cut buffer.

       rotate(NN)      rotates the cut buffers by NN positions.  NN may
                       be any positive or negative number.

       refresh()       causes the cut buffer window to be cleared and redrawn.

       selreq()        this action function handles paste requests
                       from other clients, or other xcb windows.
                       It should always be bound to SelectionRequest events.

       selclear()      this action function responds to the loss of
                       ownership of the PRIMARY selection property.
                       It should always be bound to SelectionClear events.

       quit()          causes xcb to terminate.

       The default bindings are as follows:-

       <Btn1Down>:         cut() \n\
       Shift <Btn2Down>:   clear() \n\
       <Btn2Down>:         paste() \n\
       Shift <Btn3Down>:   rotate(-1) \n\
       <Btn3Down>:         rotate(1) \n\
       <Key>Left:          rotate(-1) \n\
       <Key>Right:         rotate(1) \n\
       <Key>Up:            rotate(-1) \n\
       <Key>Down:          rotate(1) \n\
       <Key>q:             quit() \n\
       <SelReq>:           selreq() \n\
       <SelClr>:           selclear()


EXAMPLES
       The following are some examples of xcb task mode usage:-

       xcb -s 0-7 < /dev/null
       This clears the first 8 cut buffers in your server.

       echo "G'day." | xcb -display bigears:0.0 -s 1,3,5,7
       This loads the string "G'day." into four of the cut buffers on the
       display "bigears".

       xsendevent -win buffer5 '<Btn1Down>'
       This uses the program xsendevent to send a synthetic mouse click event
       to an xcb subwindow, thereby making that window the owner of the
       PRIMARY selection.

       ls `xcb -p 2,3`
       This produces a listing of all the files named in cut buffers 2 and 3.

       xcb -p 0-7 | xcb -s 0
       This concatenates the values in the first 8 cut buffers, and places the
       result back in cut buffer zero.

       xcb -S 0 && xcb -p 0
       The first command copies the current PRIMARY selection into the first
       cut buffer.  If the copy succeeds, then the second command prints that
       data on stdout.

       for i in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
       do
               xcb -p $i > $HOME/.xcb/$i
       done
       for i in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
       do
               xcb -s $i < $HOME/.xcb/$i
       done
       This first loop saves the contents of each of the cut buffers in a
       separate file under your home directory.  The second loop restores the
       cut buffer contents from those files.  When placed in your .logout and
       .login scripts respectively, the commands are a simple method of
       preserving your cut buffers across login sessions.

       function g {
               echo "$1\\c" | xcb -s 7
               grep "$@"
       }
       function vg {
               vi +/`xcb -p 7` "$@"
       }
       These two shell functions exemplify a simple mechanism for saving and
       reusing regular expressions.  The first function saves the regex used
       for grep-ing into cut buffer 7.  The second function reuses the most
       recent grep regex as a search command in vi.  There is considerable
       scope for expanding and improving these ideas.

BUGS  :-)
       Xlib's underlying protocol for moving selection data between client and
       server can sometimes be slow, depending on the amount of data involved.
       Do not expect fast performance if your selections are big or you want
       to store big files in your cut buffers!  ("big" means, say, over 10k
       bytes - but your mileage may vary).
