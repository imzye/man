EM(4)                  FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                  EM(4)

NAME
     em – Intel(R) Ethernet Driver for the FreeBSD* operating system

SYNOPSIS
     device em

DESCRIPTION
     The em driver provides support for Intel(R) Ethernet devices based on the
     Intel 82540, 82541, 82542, 82543, 82544, 82545, 82546, 82547, and 82575
     Ethernet controller chips. The driver does not support Transmit/Receive
     checksum offload and Jumbo Frames on adapters based on the Intel 82542
     and 82573 LAN controllers.

     For questions related to hardware requirements, refer to the
     documentation supplied with your adapter.

     Support for Jumbo Frames is provided via the interface MTU setting.
     Selecting an MTU larger than 1500 bytes with the ifconfig(8) utility
     configures the adapter to receive and transmit Jumbo Frames.  The maximum
     MTU setting for Jumbo Frames is 16110. This value coincides with the
     maximum Jumbo Frames size of 16132.  Some Intel gigabit adapters that
     support Jumbo Frames have a frame size limit of 9238 bytes, with a
     corresponding MTU size limit of 9216 bytes. The adapters with this
     limitation are based on the Intel(R) 82571EB, 82572EI, 82573L, 82563EB
     and 82564EI LAN controllers.

     The following Intel gigabit LAN devices do not support Jumbo Frames:

     Intel(R) PRO/1000 PM Network Connection

     Adapters based on the Intel(R) 82542 and 82573 LAN controllers.

     This driver version supports VLANs.  For information on enabling VLANs,
     see the README.  The em driver supports the following media types:

     autoselect   Enables auto-negotiation for speed and duplex.

     10baseT/UTP  Sets 10Mbps operation.  Use the mediaopt option to select
                  full-duplex mode.

     100baseTX    Sets 100Mbps operation.  Use the mediaopt option to select
                  full-duplex mode.

     1000baseSX   Sets 1000Mbps operation.  Only full-duplex mode is supported
                  at this speed.

     1000baseTX   Sets 1000Mbps operation.  Only full-duplex mode is supported
                  at this speed.

     The em driver supports both full-duplex and half-duplex. Use mediaopt to
     force the driver to either of these settings. Note that the only valid
     parameter for mediaopt is full-duplex; to force the driver to half-duplex
     when running at less than gibabit speed, leave mediaopt unspecified.

     For more information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

DIAGNOSTICS
     em%d: Unable to allocate bus resource: memory  A fatal initialization
     error has occurred.

     em%d: Unable to allocate bus resource: interrupt  A fatal initialization
     error has occurred.

     em%d: watchdog timeout -- resetting  The device has stopped responding to
     the network, or there is a problem with the network connection (cable).

SUPPORT
     For additional information regarding building and installation, see the
     README included with the driver.  For general information, go to the
     Intel support website at: http://www.intel.com/support/
