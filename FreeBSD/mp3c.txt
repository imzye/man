NAME
       mp3c - convert audio-cds to mp3

SYNOPSIS
       mp3c [-i <configfile>] [-b <batchfile> [-t <tmpfile/dir>]] [-d <cdrom-
       device>] [-v] [-n]


DESCRIPTION
       This program is a frontend for every cdripper and mp3-encoder program.
       It uses CDDB-functionality for converting audio-cds to mp3.  It can run
       in interactive and batch-mode.


OPTIONS
       -initfile <file> use alternative configfile

       -batchfile <file> run in batch mode and create shell script

       -tempfile <file/dir> specify a different directory for tempfiles
       (ripped-files), if started in batch mode (-b option given)

       -device <cdrom-device> use this device (overwrites default-
       configuration)

       -news show which things have been changed in a news version of MP3c.

       -version shows version, program and other informations and exits


       For detailed help take a look in the README file. Handling of
       interactive- mode should be obviously.

INTERACTIVE USE

       interactively.

BUGS
       Sometimes there is a "klick" at the beginning of mp3-files, if "on-the-
       fly" encoding is used together with "encoder 1.02"
