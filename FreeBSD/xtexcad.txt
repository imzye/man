NAME
       xtexcad - drawing utility that produces LaTeX \picture environments

SYNOPSIS
       xtexcad [-toolkitoption...] [-option...] [file]

DESCRIPTION
       The xtexcad utility is for drawing graphics which is intended to be
       included into a LaTeX document. For this purpose the graphics is saved
       as a LaTeX \picture environment.

       In order to produce correct input to LaTeX, the slopes of lines and the
       diameters of circles are restricted to those that LaTeX supports.


THE FILE MENU
       The following commands are available under the File menu:


       New     Erase the current graphics completely and start a new drawing.


       Load    Load graphics from a file. This pops up a file selector and
               lets you choose a file. See FILE FORMAT on how the input file
               must be structured. A file which was saved by xtexcad can be
               read in again.


       Save    Save the graphics under the current file name, which is
               displayed in the title bar of the main window. If the graphics
               has not been saved in a file yet, the function is the same as
               Save As.  An already existing file is backed-up by renaming it.
               The suffix .old is appended to the name of the backup file. The
               suffix can be changed with the resource backupSuffix.


       Save As Save the current graphics under a new file name. This pops up a
               file selector which lets you choose a file or specify a new
               file name. From now on, Save will save the graphics to the new
               file name.


       Quit    Exit from xtexcad.


THE EDIT MENU
       The following commands are available under the Edit menu:


       Copy    This creates a copy of the currently selected item.


       Delete  This deletes the currently selected item.


       Edit Text
               If the currently selected item is a text, a framed box text or
               a dashed box text, this pops up a dialog in which the text can
               be edited.


       Refresh This refreshes the drawing area.


DRAWING GRAPHICS and the DRAW MENU
       The Draw menu allows to select the drawing mode. The currently selected
       mode is indicated by a check mark.

       The first entry, Pick, switches to the pick mode. This allows that
       already drawn items can be selected and modified. To select an item
       move the pointer over it and press the left mouse button. Currently, an
       item can be selected when the pointer is over its rectangular bounding
       box. Press the left mouse button repeatedly to cycle through the
       possible items for the current pointer position. (NOTE: To select a
       text you must carefully point at the anchor point of the text.)

       When an item is selected, it can be modified by placing the pointer
       over the grips. To move the item, press the middle mouse button and
       drag the item to the desired new location. To change the size or
       direction of an object, press the left mouse button and drag the grip
       to the desired new location.

       When drawing a Line or Vector, press the left mouse button to place the
       starting point of the line or vector.  Then press the left mouse button
       again to place the end point. This is now the starting point of a new
       line. To finish the line, press the middle or right mouse button.

       For a Bezier first place the starting point, then the end point, then
       the curvature of the curve using the left mouse button. Then start with
       the next bezier.

       For the Framed Box Text and the Dashed Box Text place two opposite
       corners of the box. Then a popup appears where the text can be typed in
       and the alignment of the text within the box and the shadow style of
       the box can be selected.  After pressing Ok or Cancel, draw the next
       box.

       For a Text simply choose the location. Then a popup appears where the
       text can be entered and the alignment can be specified.

       For a Circle Outline and a Filled Circle first specify the center, then
       the size.

       For a Filled Rectangle and a Rounded Rectangle specify two opposite
       corners.


THE OPTIONS POPUP
       Pressing the Options button pops up a window containing several toggle
       buttons. With these, some features can be switched on and off (these
       features can also be controlled with X Resources):


       Enable Grid
               displays a grid when pressed. The distance between the grid
               points can be specified in the text entry below in units of
               \unitlength. The initial value of this text field can be
               controlled with the resource initGridDistance.  Whether the
               grid is initially on is controlled by the resource initGrid.


       Snap to Grid
               When this option is enabled and the option Enable Grid is also
               selected, only restricted positions in the drawing area can be
               selected (only the grid points). See also the resource
               initGrid.


       Unlimited Slopes and Unlimited Diameters
               When these options are switched on, unlimited slopes for lines
               and vectors and unlimited diameters for discs and circles are
               allowed.  Note, that output files produced with these options
               enabled will not be accepted by plain LaTeX. Normally, circles,
               discs, lines and vectors are precisely restricted to those
               available with usual LaTeX fonts.  See also the resources
               initUnlimitedSlopes and initUnlimitedCircles.


       Ruler   switches on a ruler along the top and left edges of the drawing
               area with labels in multiples of \unitlength.  See also the
               resource initRuler.


       Cross Hair
               switches on a cross hair which follows the pointer.  See also
               the resource initCross.


       Minimum Length
               When this option is enabled, xtexcad obeys that a minimum
               length is required for slanted lines and vectors.  The
               corresponding resource is initUnlimitedLengths.


THE SHIFT POPUP
       When the Shift button is pressed, a window pops up with which the
       drawing can be shifted in the drawing area. There are 4 buttons with
       arrows for the 4 directions and a small button between them which
       centers the drawing.  The amount how far to shift the drawing can be
       specified in the text entry field below the arrow buttons. The inital
       value in this field can be controlled by the resource initOffset where
       the value is understood in units of \unitlength.


THE ZOOM POPUP
       When the Zoom button is pressed, a window pops up where the current
       zoom factor (as a percent value) can be specified. The factor is
       limited to the range 25 through 400.  The inital zoom value can be
       controlled by the resource initZoomFactor.  The button shows the
       current zoom factor.  (The center button of the Shift popup is useful
       to place the drawing in the middle of the drawing area again.)


OPTIONS and X RESOURCES
       This program uses the X Toolkit and Athena widgets.  The class name for
       the application is XTeXcad.  It understands all of the core resource
       names and classes and all of the standard X Toolkit command line
       options.  The following standard X Toolkit command line arguments are
       commonly used with xtexcad:

       -fn font
               This option specifies the font to be used for displaying text
               in buttons and menu entries as well as the text in the drawing
               area.  The font used in the drawing area can selectivly be
               chosen with the application resource .font (class .Font).

       -fg color, -bg color
               This specifies the foreground and background colors of all of
               xtexcads windows. The foreground color of the drawing area can
               selectivly be chosen with the application resource .foreground
               (class .Foreground).

       -geometry geometry
               This option specifies the prefered size and position of the
               application window.

       -display host:display
               This option specifies the X server to contact.


       In addition, the following application specific resources can be used
       to customize xtexcad:


       .initOffset, class .InitOffset
               specifies the initial value by which the image is shifted by
               the buttons in the Shift popup. Default is 10.0.


       .initZoomFactor, class .InitZoomFactor
               specifies the inital zoom factor. This value is restricted to
               the range 25 to 400). Default is 100.


       .initGridDistance, class .InitGridDistance
               specifies the initial distance of the grid points. Default is
               10.0.


       .rulerFont, class .Font
               This resource specifies the font which will be used to draw the
               units on the ruler if it is displayed.


       .defaultUnitLength, class .DefaultUnitLength
               This specifies the default TeX dimension for the \unitlength of
               the saved picture. The value must be a floating point number,
               followed by one of the two-letter units of dimension as
               understood by TeX (regardless of the case): pt, cm, mm, pc, in,
               bp, dd, cc, sp, em (font-relative unit, roughly 10pt).  It is
               highly recommended to chose sensible multiples of pt as default
               (for example 10pt, 2pt, or 0.5em) because all units are
               internally translated to pt and 1pt corresponds approximately
               to 1 screen pixel at zoom 100 (see also the BUGS section).
               Default is 1.0pt.


       .backupSuffix, class .BackupSuffix
               This string is appended to the name of backup files. Default is
               .old.


       *filter, class *Filter
               This resource gives the initial value for the file filter in
               the file selector widget used by the Load, Save and Save As
               commands. Default is *.


       .initSnapGrid, class .InitSnapGrid
               This resource specifies whether only selected points on the
               grid can be chosen. Default is off.


       .initRuler, class .InitRuler
               This resource specifies whether the ruler is initially drawn.
               Default is off.


       .initGrid, class .InitRuler
               This resource specifies whether the grid is initially drawn.
               Default is off.


       .initCross, class .InitRuler
               This resource specifies whether the cross is initially drawn.
               Default is off.


       .initUnlimitedSlopes, class .InitUnlimited
               This resource specifies whether lines and vectors with
               arbitrary slopes can be drawn. Default is false.


       .initUnlimitedCircles, class .InitUnlimited
               This resource specifies whether circles with arbitrary
               diameters can be drawn. Default is false.


       .initUnlimitedLengths, class .InitUnlimited
               This resource specifies whether very short lines and vectors
               can be drawn.  Default is false.


FILE FORMAT
       xtexcad can read not only files saved by itself but also by other
       means, for example hand written files. For a file to be understood by
       xtexcad it must contain the following: Optionally, a \unitlength=TeX
       dimension command, a \begin{picture} phrase (without white space after
       \begin) with or without the optional argument, zero or more \put,
       \qbezier, or \bezier commands, and an \end{picture} phrase (without
       white space after \end). Everything before \begin{picture} (except
       \unitlength) and after \end{picture} is ignored.  The \qbezier command
       can come with or without the optional argument.  Its value, however, is
       ignored and will not be written to the file any more when the file is
       saved.

       A file created by xtexcad always assigns a value to \unitlength. The
       whole file is inside a group (curly braces) so that this assignment is
       local.  For a newly created file, the value of \unitlength will be
       taken from the resource defaultUnitLength whose default is 1.0pt.  If a
       file is loaded in, which assigns a value to \unitlength, this value
       will be preserved. This means that if you find that the picture is too
       large or too small for the LaTeX document, you can manually scale it by
       editing the \unitlength in the resulting file. If you later edit the
       file with xtexcad, it will not destroy this change, and the picture
       will appear scaled accordingly in the drawing area of xtexcad, since
       1pt corresponds to 1 screen pixel (at zoom 100).

BUGS
       Modifying objects lacks some features like cross hair. It is also very
       unfriendly with servers that do not support backingstore.  The grips
       should be transparent.

       The shadow style is currently ignored.

       Some aspects (the shadow-part of the text placement popup) may not work
       when linked with X11R4 libraries because the Toggle widget changed its
       behavior from R4 to R5.

       The optional argument of the \qbezier command is ignored and does not
       get saved to the file when a picture is loaded and saved later.

       Redrawing after modifying an item is worse than bad.

       Internally, all units are translated to TeX points (pt), and 1 screen
       pixel (at zoom 100) is taken to be approximately 1pt. However, this may
       result in rounding and positioning errors if \unitlength is not a
       proper multiple of 1pt.

       Sometimes, especially when drawing very short lines, it is possible to
       produce unsupported LaTeX-slopes of lines and vectors. Working with a
       large zoom factor helps. Also, for some \unitlengths the minimum line
       length computed is too short.
