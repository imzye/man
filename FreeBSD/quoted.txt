QUOTED(1)                           quoted                           QUOTED(1)

NAME
       quoted - A ´qotd´ Quote Server


SYNOPSIS
       The ´quoted´ application operates as an inetd invoked server, or as a
       daemon (with the ´-d´ option), and returns a randomly selected quote
       from the ´quotes´ file.  The ´quotes´ file resides in either the ´/etc´
       or ´/usr/local/etc´ directory, depending upon your operating system.
       Normally it will reside in ´/usr/local/etc´.  For more information on
       the file system hierarchy, see hier(7).


DESCRIPTION
       The ´qotd´ service gives you a random ´Quote of the Day´ from a data
       file ´quotes´ that uses a simple text format.  The ´quotes´ file format
       separates individual quotes by a ´%´ on a line by itself.  A final line
       containing a ´%´ marks the end of the file, though it is not required.

       Typically, the quotes file will look as follows:

       "I only regret that I have but one life to give for my country."
        Nathan Hale
       %
       "There is nothing to fear but fear itself."
        Franklin D. Roosevelt
       %
       "Great Spirits Have Always Encountered Violent Opposition From
        Mediocre Minds"
        Albert Einstein
       %
       c.

       You may add your own quotes at any point in the file provided that you
       maintain the same file format.  Carriage returns M should be stripped
       out if you edit this file on a computer that adds these characters at
       the end of a line.



USAGE
       quoted [-d|D][-p:port][#]

       where

       # is the optional quote number (beginning with zero) to display a
       specific quote

       and

       -d instructs quoted to run as a daemon (do not use with inetd)

       and

       -D instructs quoted to simulate running as a daemon, but run from the
       console, for debugging purposes.

       and

       -p:port instructs quoted to listen on a specific port th TCP and UDP.
       This is only valid when either -d or -D is specified.  The default port
       is 17 td.


       In ´inetd.conf´ you can add the following lines to invoke 'quoted' via
       inetd:

       qotd  stream  tcp nowait  nobody  /usr/local/bin/quoted
       qotd  dgram   udp wait    nobody  /usr/local/bin/quoted
