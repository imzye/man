NAME
       munge - MUNGE credential encoder


SYNOPSIS
       munge [OPTION]...


DESCRIPTION
       The munge program creates an MUNGE credential containing the UID and
       GID of the calling process.  Additional payload data can be
       encapsulated in as well.  The returned credential can be passed to
       another process which can validate its contents (e.g., via the unmunge
       program).  This allows an unrelated and potentially remote process to
       ascertain the identity of the calling process.

       By default, payload input is read from stdin and the credential is
       written to stdout.


OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Display a summary of the command-line options.

       -L, --license
              Display license information.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

       -n, --no-input
              Discard all input for the payload.

       -s, --string string
              Input payload from the specified string.

       -i, --input path
              Input payload from the specified file.

       -o, --output path
              Output the credential to the specified file.

       -c, --cipher string
              Specify the cipher type, either by name or number.

       -C, --list-ciphers
              Display a list of supported cipher types.

       -m, --mac string
              Specify the MAC type, either by name or number.

       -M, --list-macs
              Display a list of supported MAC types.

       -z, --zip string
              Specify the compression type, either by name or number.

       -Z, --list-zips
              Display a list of supported compression types.

       -u, --restrict-uid uid
              Specify the user name or UID allowed to decode the credential.
              This will be matched against the effective user ID of the
              process requesting the credential decode.

       -U, --uid uid
              Specify the user name or UID under which to request the
              credential.  This requires root privileges or the CAP_SETUID
              capability.

       -g, --restrict-gid gid
              Specify the group name or GID allowed to decode the credential.
              This will be matched against the effective group ID of the
              process requesting the credential decode, as well as each
              supplementary group of which the effective user ID of that
              process is a member.

       -G, --gid gid
              Specify the group name or GID under which to request the
              credential.  This requires root privileges or the CAP_SETGID
              capability.

       -t, --ttl seconds
              Specify the time-to-live (in seconds).  This controls how long
              the credential is valid once it has been encoded.  A value of 0
              selects the default TTL.  A value of -1 selects the maximum
              allowed TTL.  Note that munged can impose a maximum allowable
              TTL for all credentials which may be smaller than this value.

       -S, --socket path
              Specify the local socket for connecting with munged.


EXIT STATUS
       The munge program returns a zero exit code when the credential is
       successfully created and returned.  On error, it prints an error
       message to stderr and returns a non-zero exit code.
