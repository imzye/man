NAME
       decode-dimms - decode the information found in memory module SPD
       EEPROMs

SYNOPSIS
       decode-dimms [-c] [-f [-b]] [-d|-x|-X file [files..]]
       decode-dimms -h

DESCRIPTION
       The purpose of the decode-dimms tool is to decode the information found
       in memory module SPD EEPROMs.  The SPD data is read either from the
       running system or dump files.  In the former case, the tool requires a
       kernel module to be loaded: eeprom, at24 or ee1004 (for DDR4 SDRAM.)

PARAMETERS
       -f, --format
              Print nice html output

       -b, --bodyonly
              Don't print html header (useful for postprocessing the output)

       --side-by-side
              Display all DIMMs side-by-side if possible

       --merge-cells
              Merge neighbour cells with identical values (side-by-side output
              only, default)

       --no-merge-cells
              Don't merge neighbour cells with identical values (side-by-side
              output only)

       -c, --checksum
              Decode completely even if checksum fails

       -d     Read data from the device

       -x     Read data from hexdump files

       -X     Same as -x except treat multibyte hex data as little endian

       -h, --help
              Display the usage summary
