           # case 1
           use Unicode::Escape;
           my $escaped1 = Unicode::Escape::escape($str1, 'euc-jp');             # $str1 contains charactor that is not ASCII. $str1 is encoded by euc-jp.
           my $escaped2 = Unicode::Escape::escape($str2);     # default is utf8 # $str2 contains charactor that is not ASCII.
           my $unescaped1 = Unicode::Escape::unescape($str3, 'shiftjis');       # $str3 contains escaped Unicode character. return value is encoded by shiftjis.
           my $unescaped2 = Unicode::Escape::unescape($str4); # default is utf8 # $str4 contains escaped Unicode character.

           # case 2
           use Unicode::Escape qw(escape unescape);
           my $escaped1 = escape($str1, 'euc-jp');             # $str1 contains charactor that is not ASCII. $str1 is encoded by euc-jp.
           my $escaped2 = escape($str2);     # default is utf8 # $str2 contains charactor that is not ASCII.
           my $unescaped1 = unescape($str3, 'shiftjis');       # $str3 contains escaped Unicode character. return value is encoded by shiftjis.
           my $unescaped2 = unescape($str4); # default is utf8 # $str4 contains escaped Unicode character.

           # case 3

           my $unescaped2 = $escaper->unescape;      # default is utf8.
