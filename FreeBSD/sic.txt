NAME
       sic - text interface to the Internet Relay Chat system

SYNOPSIS
       sic [ -c confdir ] [ -i ip ] [ -l logdir ] [ -n ] [ -r script ] [ -v ]

DESCRIPTION
       The sic program is a full screen, termcap based interface to the
       Internet Relay Chat.  It can handle several concurrent connections,
       through the use of virtual windows.

OPTIONS
       -c confdir
              This can be used to override the default directory in which the
              configuration files are.  The default is $SICDIR.

       -i ip  This option instructs sic to use the given address as the local
              address.  This is only useful for multi-homed hosts.  The
              default is $SICIP.

       -l directory
              This option can be used to override the default directory in
              which logfiles will be created.  The default is $SICLOG.

       -n     Normally, on startup sic will automatically connect to the first
              server specified in the configuration.  This option can be used
              to start sic without initiation any connection.

       -r filename
              If a filename is specified, the client will read such file
              (within $SICDIR) and execute any command specified in it.

       -v     This will make sic print its version information.
