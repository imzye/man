PTH-CONFIG(1)                GNU Portable Threads                PTH-CONFIG(1)


NAME
       pth-config - Pth library build utility

VERSION
       GNU Pth 2.0.7 (08-Jun-2006)

SYNOPSIS
       pth-config [--help] [--version] [--all] [--prefix] [--exec-prefix]
       [--bindir] [--libdir] [--includedir] [--mandir] [--datadir] [--acdir]
       [--cflags] [--ldflags] [--libs]

DESCRIPTION
       The pth-config program is a little helper utility for easy configuring
       and building applications based on the pth(3) library.  It can be used
       to query the C compiler and linker flags which are required to
       correctly compile and link the application against the pth(3) library.

OPTIONS
       pth-config accepts the following options:

       --help
           Prints the short usage information.

       --version
           Prints the version number and date of the installed pth(3) library.

       --all
           Forces the output of all flags, that is, including extra flags
           which are not Pth specific.

       --prefix
           Prints the installation prefix of architecture independent files

       --exec-prefix
           Prints the installation prefix of architecture dependent files.

       --bindir
           Prints the installation directory of binaries.

       --libdir
           Prints the installation directory of libraries.

       --includedir
           Prints the installation directory of include headers.

       --mandir
           Prints the installation directory of manual pages.

       --datadir
           Prints the installation directory of shared data.

       --acdir
           Prints the installation directory of autoconf data.

       --cflags
           Prints the C compiler flags which are needed to compile the
           pth(3)-based application. The output is usually added to the
           "CFLAGS" variable of the applications "Makefile".

       --ldflags
           Prints the linker flags ("-L") which are needed to link the
           application with the pth(3) library. The output is usually added to
           the "LDFLAGS" variable of the applications "Makefile".

       --libs
           Prints the library flags ("-l") which are needed to link the
           application with the pth(3) library. The output is usually added to
           the "LIBS" variable of the applications "Makefile".

EXAMPLE
        CC      = cc
        CFLAGS  = -O `pth-config --cflags`
        LDFLAGS = `pth-config --ldflags`
        LIBS    = -lm `pth-config --libs`

        all: foo
        foo: foo.o
            $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) -o foo foo.o $(LIBS)
        foo.o: foo.c
            $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c foo.c
