NAME
       Package::Reaper - pseudo-garbage-collection for packages

VERSION
       version 1.106

SYNOPSIS
           use Package::Generator;
           use Package::Reaper;

           {
             my $package = Package::Generator->new_package;
             my $reaper  = Package::Reaper->new($package);
             ...
           }

           # at this point, $package stash has been deleted

DESCRIPTION
       This module allows you to create simple objects which, when destroyed,
       delete a given package.  This lets you approximate lexically scoped
       packages.

INTERFACE
   new
         my $reaper = Package::Reaper->new($package);

       This returns the newly generated package reaper.  When the reaper goes
       out of scope and is garbage collected, it will delete the symbol table
       entry for the package.

   package
         my $package = $reaper->package;

       This method returns the package which will be reaped.

   is_armed
         if ($reaper->is_armed) { ... }

       This method returns true if the reaper is armed and false otherwise.
       Reapers always start out armed.  A disarmed reaper will not actually
       reap when destroyed.

   disarm
         $reaper->disarm;

       This method disarms the reaper, so that it will not reap the package
       when it is destroyed.

   arm
         $reaper->arm;

       This method arms the reaper, so that it will reap its package when it
       is destroyed.  By default, new reapers are armed.
