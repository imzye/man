NAME
       RevML::Doctype - A subclass of XML::Doctype

SYNOPSIS
          use RevML::Doctype ;

          ## To use the highest RevML::Doctype module (e.g. RevML::Doctype::v0_22)
          $rmldt = RevML::Doctype->new ;

          ## To parse a .dtd file:
          $rmldt = RevML::Doctype->new( 'revml.dtd' );
          $rmldt = RevML::Doctype->new( DTD_FILE => 'revml.dtd' );

          ## To load a preparsed .pm file
          $rmldt = RevML::Doctype->new( 1.1 ) ;
          $rmldt = RevML::Doctype->new( VERSION => 1.1 ) ;

DESCRIPTION
METHODS
       new Creates an instance.

       save_as_pm
              $doctype->save_as_pm ;
              $doctype->save_as_pm( $out_spec ) ;

           Outspec is a module name.  'RevML::Doctype::vNNN' is assumed if no
           outspec is provided.  Use '-' to emit to STDOUT.

           Saves the Doctype object in a perl module.  Tries to save in
           lib/RevML/Doctype/ if that directory exists, then in ./ if not.

       import
       use
              ## To extablish a default RevML::Doctype for the current package:
              use RevML::Doctype 'DEFAULT' ;
              use RevML::Doctype DTD_FILE => 'revml.dtd' ;

SUBCLASSING
       This class uses the fields pragma, so you'll need to use base and
       possibly fields in any subclasses.
