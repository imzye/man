pkg-compare(8)          FreeBSD System Manager's Manual         pkg-compare(8)

NAME
       pkg-compare

SYNOPSIS
       pkg-compare

       pkg-compare new_path old_path

       pkg-compare -m -p new_path old_path


DESCRIPTION
       This program reads local.sqlite in new_path and compares list of
       installed packages in local.sqlite in old_path. If a package is found
       in old_path which is not in new_path then the name of the port is
       printed, one per line.

       Command line switches:
            -p   prefix each package with 'pkg install -Rf'
            -m   show manually installed packages only, no deps

       Upgrade Strategy:

       # mv /usr/local /usr/old-local
       # mv /var/db/pkg /var/db/old-pkg
       # cd /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/pkg
       # make
       # make install clean
       # cd /usr/ports/databases/sqlite3
       # make
       # make install clean
       # pkg-compare -p -m /var/db/pkg /var/db/old-pkg > upgrade.sh
       # yes | sh upgrade.sh


OPTIONS
       -p     Prefix each package with 'pkg install -Rf'.


FILES
       pkg-compare uses local.sqlite which is created/managed by
       /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/pkg (maybe not anymore?).
