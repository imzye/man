PAC(8)                  FreeBSD System Manager's Manual                 PAC(8)

NAME
     pac – printer/plotter accounting information

SYNOPSIS
     pac [-Pprinter] [-c] [-m] [-pprice] [-s] [-r] [name ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The pac utility reads the printer/plotter accounting files, accumulating
     the number of pages (the usual case) or feet (for raster devices) of
     paper consumed by each user, and printing out how much each user consumed
     in pages or feet and dollars.

     Options and operands available:

     -Pprinter  Accounting is done for the named printer.  Normally,
                accounting is done for the default printer (site dependent) or
                the value of the environment variable PRINTER is used.

     -c         Cause the output to be sorted by cost; usually the output is
                sorted alphabetically by name.

     -m         Cause the host name to be ignored in the accounting file.
                This allows for a user on multiple machines to have all of his
                printing charges grouped together.

     -pprice    The value price is used for the cost in dollars instead of the
                default value of 0.02 or the price specified in /etc/printcap.

     -r         Reverse the sorting order.

     -s         Accounting information is summarized on the summary accounting
                file; this summarization is necessary since on a busy system,
                the accounting file can grow by several lines per day.

     names      Statistics are only printed for user(s) name; usually,
                statistics are printed for every user who has used any paper.

FILES
     /var/account/?acct  raw accounting files
     /var/account/?_sum  summary accounting files
     /etc/printcap       printer capability data base

SEE ALSO
     printcap(5)

HISTORY
     The pac utility appeared in 4.0BSD.

BUGS
     The relationship between the computed price and reality is as yet
     unknown.
