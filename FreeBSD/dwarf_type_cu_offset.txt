SYNOPSIS
     #include <libdwarf.h>

     int
     dwarf_get_types(Dwarf_Debug dbg, Dwarf_Type **types,
         Dwarf_Signed *ntypes, Dwarf_Error *err);

     int
     dwarf_type_cu_offset(Dwarf_Type type, Dwarf_Off *cu_offset,
         Dwarf_Error *err);

     int
     dwarf_type_die_offset(Dwarf_Type type, Dwarf_Off *die_offset,
         Dwarf_Error *err);

     int
     dwarf_type_name_offsets(Dwarf_Type type, char **name,
         Dwarf_Off *die_offset, Dwarf_Off *cu_die_offset, Dwarf_Error *err);

     int
     dwarf_typename(Dwarf_Type type, char **name, Dwarf_Error *err);

DESCRIPTION
     These APIs retrieve information about user-defined types from the SGI-
     specific “.debug_typenames” section.

     Standards-conformant applications should use the functions
     dwarf_get_pubtypes(3), dwarf_pubtype_cu_offset(3),
     dwarf_pubtype_die_offset(3), dwarf_pubtype_name_offsets(3) and
     dwarf_pubtypename(3), which operate on the equivalent “.debug_pubtypes”
     section defined by the DWARF3 standard.

     Information about user-defined types is returned using opaque descriptors
     of type Dwarf_Type.  Applications need to use the functions described
     below to retrieve the name and offset information contained in these
     descriptors.

     Function dwarf_get_types() retrieves descriptors for all user-defined
     types associated with the DWARF debug context specified by argument dbg.
     The argument types should point to a location that will be set to a
     pointer to an array of Dwarf_Type descriptors.  The argument ntypes
     should point to a location that will be set to the number of descriptors
     returned.

     Function dwarf_type_cu_offset() returns the offset, relative to the
     “.debug_info” section, of the compilation unit that contains the
     debugging information entry associated with the argument type.  Argument
     cu_offset should point to a location that will hold the returned offset.

     Function dwarf_type_die_offset() retrieves the offset, relative to the
     “.debug_info” section, of the debugging information entry associated with
     the argument type, and stores it into the location pointed to by the
     argument die_offset.

     Function dwarf_type_name_offsets() retrieves the name and offsets for the
     debugging information entry for argument type.  Argument name should
     point to a location which will be set to a pointer to a NUL-terminated
     string containing the name of the associated debugging information entry.
     Argument die_offset should point to a location which will be set to the
     offset, relative to the “.debug_info” section, of the associated
     debugging information entry.  Argument cu_die_offset should point to a
     location which will be set to a offset, relative to the “.debug_info”
     section, of the first debugging information entry in the compilation unit
     associated with argument type.

     Function dwarf_typename() sets the location pointed to by argument name
     to a pointer to a NUL-terminated string holding the name of the debugging
     information entry associated with the argument type.

   Memory Management
     The memory area used for the array of Dwarf_Type descriptors returned in
     argument types by function dwarf_get_types() is owned by the DWARF Access
     Library (libdwarf, -ldwarf).  Application code should not attempt to
     directly free this pointer.  Portable code should instead use the
     function dwarf_types_dealloc(3) to indicate that the memory area may be
     freed.

     The memory area used for the string returned in the name argument to
     functions dwarf_type_name_offsets() and dwarf_typename() is owned by the
     DWARF Access Library (libdwarf, -ldwarf).  Portable code should indicate
     that the memory area can be freed using the dwarf_dealloc(3) function.

   Error Returns
     If argument err is not NULL, these functions will use it to store error
     information, in case of an error.

RETURN VALUES
     On success, these functions returns DW_DLV_OK.  In case of an error, they
     return DW_DLV_ERROR and set the argument err.

ERRORS
     These functions may fail with the following errors:

     [DW_DLE_ARGUMENT]       One of the arguments cu_die_offset, cu_offset,
                             dbg, die_offset, type, types, name, or ntypes was
                             NULL.

     [DW_DLE_NO_ENTRY]       The DWARF debugging context referenced by
                             argument dbg did not contain information about
                             user-defined types.
