PTHREAD_CLEANUP_POP(3)                        FreeBSD Library Functions Manual

NAME
     pthread_cleanup_pop – call the first cleanup routine

LIBRARY
     POSIX Threads Library (libpthread, -lpthread)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <pthread.h>

     void
     pthread_cleanup_pop(int execute);

DESCRIPTION
     The pthread_cleanup_pop() function pops the top cleanup routine off of
     the current threads cleanup routine stack, and, if execute is non-zero,
     it will execute the function.  If there is no cleanup routine then
     pthread_cleanup_pop() does nothing.

     The pthread_cleanup_pop() function is implemented as a macro that closes
     a block.  Invocations of this function must appear as standalone
     statements that are paired with an earlier call of
     pthread_cleanup_push(3) in the same lexical scope.

RETURN VALUES
     The pthread_cleanup_pop() function does not return any value.

ERRORS
     None

SEE ALSO
     pthread_cleanup_push(3), pthread_exit(3)

STANDARDS
     The pthread_cleanup_pop() function conforms to ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996
     (“POSIX.1”).
