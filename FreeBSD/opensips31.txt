SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
       opensips reads the configuration data from
       /usr/local/etc/opensips31/opensips.cfg (or the file specified with -f
       on the command line).  The file contains global configuration
       parameters, module loading commands and the script that will be
       executed for each received request. Lines starting with # or enclosed
       in /* ... */ are interpreted as comments.
