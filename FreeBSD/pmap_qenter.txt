PMAP_QENTER(9)         FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual        PMAP_QENTER(9)

NAME
     pmap_qenter, pmap_qremove – manage temporary kernel space mappings

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <vm/vm.h>
     #include <vm/pmap.h>

     void
     pmap_qenter(vm_offset_t sva, vm_page_t *m, int count);

     void
     pmap_qremove(vm_offset_t sva, int count);

DESCRIPTION
     The pmap_qenter() function accepts a linear array of count pointers to
     wired pages *m, and enters each of these pages into the kernel virtual
     address (KVA) space, beginning at the address sva.  The pages are mapped
     non-executable, if possible.  (For example, non-PAE i386 has no
     capability to map pages non-executable.)

     The pmap_qremove() function tears out a mapping from the kernel virtual
     address space, beginning at sva and for count pages.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
     The pmap_qenter() function is intended for temporary mappings that do not
     require page modification or reference counting.  Old mappings are simply
     overwritten.  The pages must be wired into physical memory.

     The corresponding pmap_qremove() function is intended to remove such
     temporary mappings.
