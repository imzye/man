PTHREAD_MUTEX_UNLOCK(3)                       FreeBSD Library Functions Manual

NAME
     pthread_mutex_unlock – unlock a mutex

LIBRARY
     POSIX Threads Library (libpthread, -lpthread)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <pthread.h>

     int
     pthread_mutex_unlock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);

DESCRIPTION
     If the current thread holds the lock on mutex, then the
     pthread_mutex_unlock() function unlocks mutex.

     If the argument pointed by the mutex is a robust mutex in the
     inconsistent state, and the call to pthread_mutex_consistent() function
     was not done prior to unlocking, further locking attempts on the mutex
     mutex are denied and locking functions return ENOTRECOVERABLE error.

RETURN VALUES
     If successful, pthread_mutex_unlock() will return zero, otherwise an
     error number will be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     The pthread_mutex_unlock() function will fail if:

     [EINVAL]           The value specified by mutex is invalid.

     [EPERM]            The current thread does not hold a lock on mutex.

SEE ALSO
     pthread_mutex_destroy(3), pthread_mutex_init(3), pthread_mutex_lock(3),
     pthread_mutex_trylock(3)

STANDARDS
     The pthread_mutex_unlock() function conforms to ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996
     (“POSIX.1”).
