DESCRIPTION
       mairix indexes and searches a collection of email messages.  The
       folders containing the messages for indexing are defined in the
       configuration file.  The indexing stage produces a database file.  The
       database file provides rapid access to details of the indexed messages
       during searching operations.  A search normally produces a folder (so-
       called mfolder) containing the matched messages.  However, a raw mode
       (-r) exists which just lists the matched messages instead.

       It can operate with the following folder types

       *      maildir

       *      MH (compatible with the MH folder formats used by xmh, sylpheed,
              claws-mail, nnml (Gnus) and evolution)

       *      mbox (including mboxes that have been compressed with gzip or
              bzip2)

       *      IMAP: remote folders on an IMAP server

       If maildir or MH source folders are used, and a search outputs its
       matches to an mfolder in maildir or MH format, symbolic links are used
       to reference the original messages inside the mfolder.  However, if
       mbox folders are involved, copies of messages are made instead. If IMAP
       folders are used for both source results, IMAP server-side copies of
       messages are made. With IMAP source folders and any other type of
       results folder, messages are downloaded from the IMAP server to be
       written to the results folder. With an IMAP results folder and any
       other type of source folders, messages are uploaded to the IMAP server
       to be appended to the results folder.

OPTIONS
       mairix decides whether indexing or searching is required by looking for
       the presence of any search-patterns on the command line.


   Special modes
       -h, --help
              Show usage summary and exit


       -V, --version
              Show program version and exit


       -d
              Dump the database's contents in human-readable form to stdout.


   General options
       -f mairixrc

       --rcfile mairixrc
              Specify an alternative configuration file to use.  The default
              configuration file is ~/.mairixrc.


       -v, --verbose
              Make the output more verbose


       -Q, --no-integrity-checks
              Normally mairix will do some internal integrity tests on the
              database.  The -Q option removes these checks, making mairix run
              faster, but it will be less likely to detect internal problems
              if any bugs creep in.

              The nochecks directive in the rc file has the same effect.


       --unlock
              mairix locks its database file during any indexing or searching
              operation to prevent multiple indexing runs interfering with
              each other, or an indexing run interfering with search runs.
              The --unlock option removes the lockfile before doing the
              requested indexing or searching operation.  This is a convenient
              way of cleaning up a stale lockfile if an earlier run crashed
              for some reason or was aborted.


   Indexing options
       -p, --purge
              Cause stale (dead) messages to be purged from the database
              during an indexing run.  (Normally, stale messages are left in
              the database because of the additional cost of compacting away
              the storage that they take up.)


       -F, --fast-index
              When processing maildir and MH folders, mairix normally compares
              the mtime and size of each message against the values stored in
              the database.  If they have changed, the message will be
              rescanned.  This check requires each message file to be stat'ed.
              For large numbers of messages in these folder types, this can be
              a sizeable overhead.

              This option tells mairix to assume that when a message currently
              on-disc has a name matching one already in the database, it
              should assume the message is unchanged.

              A later indexing run without using this option will fix up any
              rescans that were missed due to its use.


       --force-hash-key-new-database hash
              This option should only be used for debugging.
              If a new database is created, hash is used as hash key, instead
              of a random hash.


   Search options
       -a, --augment
              Append newly matches messages to the current mfolder instead of
              creating the mfolder from scratch.


       -t, --threads
              As well as returning the matched messages, also return every
              message in the same thread as one of the real matches.


       -r, --raw-output
              Instead of creating an mfolder containing the matched messages,
              just show their paths on stdout.


       -x, --excerpt-output
              Instead of creating an mfolder containing the matched messages,
              display an excerpt from their headers on stdout.  The excerpt
              shows To, Cc, From, Subject and Date. With IMAP source folders,
              this requires downloading each matched message from the IMAP
              server.


       -H, --force-hardlinks
              Instead of creating symbolic links, force the use of hardlinks.
              This helps mailers such as alpine to realize that there are new
              mails in the search folder.


       -o mfolder

       --mfolder mfolder
              Specify a temporary alternative path for the mfolder to use,
              overriding the mfolder directive in the rc file.

              mairix will refuse to output search results into any folder that
              appears to be amongst those that are indexed.  This is to
              prevent accidental deletion of emails.


   Search patterns
       t:word
              Match word in the To: header.


       c:word
              Match word in the Cc: header.


       f:word
              Match word in the From: header.


       s:word
              Match word in the Subject: header.


       m:word
              Match word in the Message-ID: header.


       b:word
              Match word in the message body.

              Message body is taken to mean any body part of type text/plain
              or text/html.  For text/html, text within meta tags is ignored.
              In particular, the URLs inside <A HREF="..."> tags are not
              currently indexed.  Non-text attachments are ignored.  If
              there's an attachment of type message/rfc822, this is parsed and
              the match is performed on this sub-message too.  If a hit
              occurs, the enclosing message is treated as having a hit.


       d:[start-datespec]-[end-datespec]
              Match messages with Date: headers lying in the specific range.


       z:[low-size]-[high-size]
              Match messages whose size lies in the specified range.  If the
              low-size argument is omitted it defaults to zero.  If the
              high-size argument is omitted it defaults to infinite size.

              For example, to match messages between 10kilobytes and
              20kilobytes in size, the following search term can be used:

                   mairix z:10k-20k



              The suffix 'k' on a number means multiply by 1024, and the
              suffix 'M' on a number means multiply by 1024*1024.


       n:word
              Match word occurring as the name of an attachment in the
              message.  Since attachment names are usually long, this option
              would usually be used in the substring form.  So

                   mairix n:mairix=



              would match all messages which have attachments whose names
              contain the substring mairix.

              The attachment name is determined from the name=xxx or
              filename=xxx qualifiers on the Content-Type: and Content-
              Disposition: headers respectively.


       F:flags
              Match messages with particular flag settings.  The available
              flags are 's' meaning seen, 'r' meaning replied, and 'f' meaning
              flagged.  The flags are case-insensitive.  A flag letter may be
              prefixed by a '-' to negate its sense.  Thus


                   mairix F:-s d:1w-



              would match any unread message less than a week old, and


                   mairix F:f-r d:-1m



              would match any flagged message older than a month which you
              haven't replied to yet.

              Note that the flag characters and their meanings agree with
              those used as the suffix letters on message filenames in maildir
              folders.


   Searching for a match amongst more than one part of a message
       Multiple body parts may be grouped together, if a match in any of them
       is sought.  Common examples follow.


       tc:word
              Match word in either the To: or Cc: headers (or both).


       bs:word
              Match word in either the Subject: header or the message body (or
              both).


       The a: search pattern is an abbreviation for tcf:; i.e. match the word
       in the To:, Cc: or From: headers.  ("a" stands for "address" in this
       case.)


   Match words
       The word argument to the search strings can take various forms.


       ~word
              Match messages not containing the word.


       word1,word2
              This matches if both the words are matched in the specified
              message part.


       word1/word2
              This matches if either of the words are matched in the specified
              message part.


       substring=
              Match any word containing substring as a substring


       substring=N
              Match any word containing substring, allowing up to N errors in
              the match.  For example, if N is 1, a single error is allowed,
              where an error can be

       *      a missing letter

       *      an extra letter

       *      a different letter.


       ^substring=
              Match any word containing substring as a substring, with the
              requirement that substring occurs at the beginning of the
              matched word.


   Precedence matters
       The binding order of the constructions is:


       1.     Individual command line arguments define separate conditions
              which are AND-ed together


       2.     Within a single argument, the letters before the colon define
              which message parts the expression applies to.  If there is no
              colon, the expression applies to all the headers listed earlier
              and the body.


       3.     After the colon, slashes delineate separate disjuncts, which are
              OR-ed together.


       4.     Each disjunct may contain separate conjuncts, which are
              separated by commas.  These conditions are AND-ed together.


       5.     Each conjunct may start with a tilde to negate it, and may be
              followed by a slash to indicate a substring match, optionally
              followed by an integer to define the maximum number of errors
              allowed.


   Date specification
       This section describes the syntax used for specifying dates when
       searching using the `d:' option.

       Dates are specified as a range.  The start and end of the range can
       both be specified.  Alternatively, if the start is omitted, it is
       treated as being the beginning of time.  If the end is omitted, it is
       treated as the current time.

       There are 4 basic formats:

       d:start-end
              Specify both start and end explicitly

       d:start-
              Specify start, end is the current time

       d:-end Specify end, start is 'a long time ago' (i.e. early enough to
              include any message).

       d:period
              Specify start and end implicitly, as the start and end of the
              period given.


       The start and end can be specified either absolute or relative.  A
       relative endpoint is given as a number followed by a single letter
       defining the scaling:


       ┌────────┬─────────────┬───────────┬───────────────────────┐
       │letter  │  short for  │  example  │  meaning              │
       ┝━━━━━━━━┿━━━━━━━━━━━━━┿━━━━━━━━━━━┿━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┥
       │d       │  days       │  3d       │  3 days               │
       │w       │  weeks      │  2w       │  2 weeks (14 days)    │
       │m       │  months     │  5m       │  5 months (150 days)  │
       │y       │  years      │  4y       │  4 years (4*365 days) │
       └────────┴─────────────┴───────────┴───────────────────────┘

       Months are always treated as 30 days, and years as 365 days, for this
       purpose.

       Absolute times can be specified in many forms.  Some forms have
       different meanings when they define a start date from that when they
       define an end date.  Where a single expression specifies both the start
       and end (i.e. where the argument to d: doesn't contain a `-'), it will
       usually have different interpretations in the two cases.

       In the examples below, suppose the current date is Sunday May 18th,
       2003 (when I started to write this material.)

       └─────────────────────┴──────────────────────┴───────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────┘

       The principles in the table work as follows.

       •      When the expression defines a period of more than a day (i.e. if
              a month or year is specified), the earliest day in the period is
              taken when the start date is defined, and the last day in the
              period if the end of the range is being defined.

       •      The end date is always taken to be on or before the current
              date.

       •      The start date is always taken to be on or before the end date.


SETTING UP THE MATCH FOLDER
       If the match folder does not exist when running in search mode, it is
       automatically created.  For 'mformat=maildir' (the default), this
       should be all you need to do.  If you use 'mformat=mh', you may have to
       run some commands before your mailer will recognize the folder.  e.g.
       for mutt, you could do

              mkdir -p /home/richard/Mail/mfolder
              touch /home/richard/Mail/mfolder/.mh_sequences

       which seems to work.  Alternatively, within mutt, you could set
       MBOX_TYPE to 'mh' and save a message to '+mfolder' to have mutt set up
       the structure for you in advance.

       If you use Sylpheed, the best way seems to be to create the new folder
       from within Sylpheed before letting mairix write into it.


EXAMPLES
       Suppose my email address is <richard@doesnt.exist>.

       Either of the following will match all messages newer than 3 months
       from me with the word 'chrony' in the subject line:

              mairix d:3m- f:richard+doesnt+exist s:chrony
              mairix d:3m- f:richard@doesnt.exist s:chrony

       Suppose I don't mind a few spurious matches on the address, I want a
       wider date range, and I suspect that some messages I replied to might
       have had the subject keyword spelt wrongly (let's allow up to 2
       errors):

              mairix d:6m- f:richard s:chrony=2

NOTES
       mairix works exclusively in terms of words.  The index that's built in
       indexing mode contains a table of which words occur in which messages.
       Hence, the search capability is based on finding messages that contain
       particular words.  mairix defines a word as any string of alphanumeric
       characters + underscore.  Any whitespace, punctuation, hyphens etc are
       treated as word boundaries.

       mairix has special handling for the To:, Cc: and From: headers.
       Besides the normal word scan, these headers are scanned a second time,
       where the characters '@', '-' and '.' are also treated as word
       characters.  This allows most (if not all) email addresses to appear in
       the database as single words.  So if you have a mail from
       wibble@foobar.zzz, it will match on both these searches


              mairix f:foobar
              mairix f:wibble@foobar.zzz

       It should be clear by now that the searching cannot be used to find
       messages matching general regular expressions.  This has never been
       much of a limitation.  Most searches are for particular keywords that
       were in the messages, or details of the recipients, or the approximate
       date.

       It's also worth pointing out that there is no 'locality' information
       stored, so you can't search for messages that have one words 'close' to
       some other word.  For every message and every word, there is a simple
       yes/no condition stored - whether the message contains the word in a
       particular header or in the body.  So far this has proved to be
       adequate.  mairix has a similar feel to using an Internet search
       engine.

BUGS
       We need a plugin scheme to allow more types of attachment to be scanned
       and indexed.
