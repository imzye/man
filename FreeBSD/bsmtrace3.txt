BSMTRACE(1)             FreeBSD General Commands Manual            BSMTRACE(1)

NAME
     bsmtrace – host-based IDS based on OpenBSM

SYNOPSIS
     bsmtrace [-bdFhv] [-a trail] [-f config_file] [-p pid_file]

DESCRIPTION
     BSMtrace is a utility that processes audit trails, or real-time audit
     feeds provided by audit pipes.  It loads a set of finite state machines
     or sequences from the supplied configuration file and watches the audit
     streams for instances of these sequences.  For more information, the
     example bsmtrace.conf file should be reviewed.

     It operates by reading a configuration file that lists sequences which
     should result in actions. The default configuration file is
     /etc/bsmtrace.conf.  BSM records are taken from /dev/auditpipe and run
     through a finite state machine which attempts to match a stream of
     records to defined sequences.

OPTIONS
     -a trail          Audit trail to be examined.

     -b                Dump the last BSM record which results in a sequence
                       match to stdout.

     -d                Print debugging messages.

     -f config_file    Location of config file.

     -F                Run program in foreground.

     -h                Print this help message.

     -p pid_file       Location of pid file.

     -v                Print version and exit.

DIAGNOSTICS
     The bsmtrace utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
