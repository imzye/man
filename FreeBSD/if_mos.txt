MOS(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 MOS(4)

NAME
     mos – Moschip MCS7730/MCS7830/MCS7832 USB Ethernet driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device uhci
           device ohci
           device ehci
           device usb
           device miibus
           device uether
           device mos

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_mos_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The mos driver provides support for USB Ethernet adapters based on the
     Moschip MCS7730/MCS7830/MCS7832 chipset.

     The adapters that contain the Moschip MCS7730/MCS7830/MCS7832 chipset
     will operate at 100Base-TX and full-duplex.

     The Moschip contains a 10/100 Ethernet MAC with MII interface and is
     designed to work with both Ethernet and HomePNA transceivers.  Although
     designed to interface with 100Mbps peripherals, this only works with USB
     2.0. The existing USB 1.0 standard specifies a maximum transfer speed of
     12Mbps.  USB 1.0 Users should therefore not expect to actually achieve
     100Mbps speeds with these devices.

     The Moschip supports a 64-bit multicast hash table, single perfect filter
     entry for the station address and promiscuous mode.  Packets are received
     and transmitted over separate USB bulk transfer endpoints.

     For more information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

HARDWARE
