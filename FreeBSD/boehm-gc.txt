DESCRIPTION
       GC_malloc and GC_free are plug-in replacements for standard malloc and
       free.  However, GC_malloc will attempt to reclaim inaccessible space
       automatically by invoking a conservative garbage collector at
       appropriate points.  The collector traverses all data structures
       accessible by following pointers from the machines registers, stack(s),
       data, and bss segments.  Inaccessible structures will be reclaimed.  A
       machine word is considered to be a valid pointer if it is an address
       inside an object allocated by GC_malloc or friends.

       In most cases it is preferable to call the macros GC_MALLOC, GC_FREE,
       etc.  instead of calling GC_malloc and friends directly.  This allows
       debugging versions of the routines to be substituted by defining
       GC_DEBUG before including gc.h.

       See the documentation in the include files gc_cpp.h and gc_allocator.h,
       as well as the gcinterface.md file in the distribution, for an
       alternate, C++ specific interface to the garbage collector.  Note that
       C++ programs generally need to be careful to ensure that all allocated
       memory (whether via new, malloc, or STL allocators) that may point to
       garbage collected memory is either itself garbage collected, or at
       least traced by the collector.

       Unlike the standard implementations of malloc, GC_malloc clears the
       newly allocated storage.  GC_malloc_atomic does not.  Furthermore, it
       informs the collector that the resulting object will never contain any
       pointers, and should therefore not be scanned by the collector.

       GC_free can be used to deallocate objects, but its use is optional, and
       generally discouraged.  GC_realloc has the standard realloc semantics.
       It preserves pointer-free-ness.  GC_register_finalizer allows for
       registration of functions that are invoked when an object becomes
       inaccessible.

       The garbage collector tries to avoid allocating memory at locations
       that already appear to be referenced before allocation.  (Such apparent
       ``pointers'' are usually large integers and the like that just happen
       to look like an address.)  This may make it hard to allocate very large
       objects.  An attempt to do so may generate a warning.

       GC_malloc_ignore_off_page and GC_malloc_atomic_ignore_off_page inform
       the collector that the client code will always maintain a pointer to
       near the beginning (i.e. within the first heap block) of the object,
       and that pointers beyond that can be ignored by the collector.  This
       makes it much easier for the collector to place large objects.  These
       are recommended for large object allocation.  (Objects expected to be >
       ~100 KB should be allocated this way.)

       It is also possible to use the collector to find storage leaks in
       programs destined to be run with standard malloc/free.  The collector
       can be compiled for thread-safe operation.  Unlike standard malloc, it
       is safe to call malloc after a previous malloc call was interrupted by
       a signal, provided the original malloc call is not resumed.

       The collector may, on rare occasion, produce warning messages.  On UNIX
       machines these appear on stderr.  Warning messages can be filtered,
       redirected, or ignored with GC_set_warn_proc This is recommended for
       production code.  See gc.h for details.

       Fully portable code should call GC_INIT from the primordial thread of
       the main program before making any other GC calls.  On most platforms
       this does nothing and the collector is initialized on first use.  On a
       few platforms explicit initialization is necessary.  And it can never
       hurt.

       Debugging versions of many of the above routines are provided as
       macros.  Their names are identical to the above, but consist of all
       capital letters.  If GC_DEBUG is defined before gc.h is included, these
       routines do additional checking, and allow the leak detecting version
       of the collector to produce slightly more useful output.  Without
       GC_DEBUG defined, they behave exactly like the lower-case versions.

       On some machines, collection will be performed incrementally after a
       call to GC_enable_incremental.  This may temporarily write protect
       pages in the heap.  See the README file for more information on how
       this interacts with system calls that write to the heap.

       Other facilities not discussed here include limited facilities to
       support incremental collection on machines without appropriate VM
       support, provisions for providing more explicit object layout
       information to the garbage collector, more direct support for ``weak''
       pointers, support for ``abortable'' garbage collections during idle
       time, etc.

PORT INFORMATION
       In this (FreeBSD package) installation, gc.h and gc_cpp.h will probably
       be found in /usr/local/include, and the library in /usr/local/lib.

       This library has been compiled as drop-in replacements for malloc and
       free (which is to say, all malloc calls will allocate garbage-
       collectable data).  There is no need to include "gc.h" in your C files
       unless you want access to the debugging (and other) functions defined
       there, or unless you want to explicitly use GC_malloc_uncollectable for
       some allocations.  Just link against them whenever you want either
       garbage collection or leak detection.

       The C++ header file, "gc_cpp.h", is necessary for C++ programs, to
       obtain the appropriate definitions of the new and delete operators.
       The comments in both of these header files presently provide far better
       documentation for the package than this man page; look there for more
       information.

       This library is compiled without (explicit) support for the
       experimental gc extension of g++.  This may or may not make a
       difference.
