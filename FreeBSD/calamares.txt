CALAMARES(8)            FreeBSD System Manager's Manual           CALAMARES(8)

NAME
       calamares - distribution-independent system installer

SYNOPSIS
       calamares [options]

DESCRIPTION
       calamares is a distribution-independent system installer, with an
       advanced partitioning feature for both manual and automated
       partitioning operations. It is the first installer with an automated
       “Replace Partition” option, which makes it easy to reuse a partition
       over and over for distribution testing. Calamares is designed to be
       customizable by distribution maintainers without need for cumbersome
       patching, thanks to third party branding and external modules support.


OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Displays this help.

       -v, --version
              Displays version information.

       -d, --debug
              Debugging mode for testing purposes. Implies -D8 and -c..

       -D <level>
              Sets logging-level. Higher numbers are more verbose.

       -c, --config <config>
              Configuration directory to use, for testing purposes.

       -X, --xdg-config
              Use XDG environment variables for file lookup.

       -T, --debug-translation
              Use translations from current directory.


FILES
       calamares reads its configuration from many files.  The first
       configuration file is settings.conf which is located in one of the
       configuration locations.  When started with -d calamares looks in the
       current directory for a settings file.  When started with -X calamares
       looks in the directories specified by XDG_CONFIG_DIRS for a settings
       file.  If no settings file is found elsewhere, calamares looks in pre-
       configured directories like /etc .

       The contents of the settings.conf file dictate where other
       configuration files are located, and which configuration files are
       used.

       The command-line arguments for calamares are primarily for developers
       convenience and should not be needed in nearly any situation in which
       calamares is deployed. Most live CD environments and OEM installations
       should have installed configuration files in their correct system-wide
       locations.
