NAME
       timbl - Tilburg Memory Based Learner

SYNOPSIS
       timbl [options]

       timbl -f data-file -t test‐file


DESCRIPTION
       TiMBL is an open source software package implementing several
       memory‐based learning algorithms, among which IB1‐IG, an implementation
       of k‐nearest neighbor classification with feature weighting suitable
       for symbolic feature spaces, and IGTree, a decision‐tree approximation
       of IB1‐IG. All implemented algorithms have in common that they store
       some representation of the training set explicitly in memory. During
       testing, new cases are classified by extrapolation from the most
       similar stored cases.


OPTIONS
       -a <n> or -a <string>
              determines the classification algorithm.

              Possible values are:

              0 or IB
               the IB1 (k‐NN) algorithm (default)

              1 or IGTREE
               a decision‐tree‐based approximation of IB1

              2 or TRIBL
               a hybrid of IB1 and IGTREE

              3 or IB2
               an incremental editing version of IB1
