WAYLAND-LOGOUT(1)       FreeBSD General Commands Manual      WAYLAND-LOGOUT(1)

NAME
     wayland-logout – generic logout utility for wayland compositors

DESCRIPTION
     wayland-logout is a compositor agnostic utility for simulating a logout
     with any wayland compositor.

     It sends a SIGTERM signal(3) to the running compositor PID which is
     obtained by looking at the environment variables.

ENVIRONMENT
     wayland-logout uses the WAYLAND_DISPLAY and XDG_RUNTIME_DIR environment
     variables to get the socket(2) corresponding to the compositor instance.

EXIT STATUS
     wayland-logout exits with non-zero if an error has occurred along with
     the error reasoning and exits with 0 on success.

EXAMPLES
     To kill the current compositor instance, run inside the compositor
     environment:
           $ wayland-logout

     A typical use case, to kill a specific compositor instance of another
     user (with uid=1002), run as the other user (or as root):
           $ env -i XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/1002 WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-4
           wayland-logout
     or
           $ WAYLAND_DISPLAY=/run/user/1002/wayland-4 wayland-logout
