NAME
       SWF::Builder - Create SWF movie.

SYNOPSIS
         use SWF::Builder;

         my $movie = SWF::Builder->new
           ( FrameRate => 15,
             FrameSize => [0, 0, 400, 400],
             BackgroundColor => 'ffffff'
             );

         my $shape = $movie->new_shape   # red triangle.
           ->fillstyle('ff0000')
           ->linestyle(1, '000000')
           ->moveto(0,-11)
           ->lineto(10,6)
           ->lineto(-10,6)
           ->lineto(0,-11);

         my $instance = $shape->place;

         for (my $x = 0; $x < 400; $x++) {
             $instance->rotate(15)->moveto($x,200);
         }
         $movie->save('triangle.swf');

DESCRIPTION
       SWF::Builder is a wrapper of SWF::File.  It provides an easy way to
       create SWF6 movie.

       The SWF movie consists a dictionary of character definitions and a
       hierarchical group of movie clips.  You create a movie by following
       steps:

       1.  create a '_root' movie by SWF::Builder->new.

       2.  define characters such as shapes, fonts, texts, movieclips, and so
           on, by $movie->new_XXX methods.

       3.  get a display instance of the character by $char->place.

       4.  move, scale, and rotate the instance every frame.

       5.  repeat 2-4 if you need.

       6.  save the whole movie by $movie->save.

   '_root' movie
       The '_root' movie is a top of the movie clip hierarchy.  It has
       properties of the whole SWF movie. It also has character constructors
       and other methods for movie. See the next section for details.

       $movie = SWF::Builder->new( [FrameRate => $rate, FrameSize => [$xmin,
       $ymin, $xmax, $ymax], BackgroundColor => $color, Version => $version] )
           creates a new '_root' movie. It can take three optional named
           parameters.  FrameRate is a frame count per second. FrameSize is a
           box size of frames, which is an array reference of the coordinates
           of top-left and bottom-right of the box in pixels.  BackgroundColor
           is a background color of the movie. It can take a six-figure
           hexadecimal string, an array reference of R, G, and B value, an
           array reference of named parameters such as [Red => 255], and
           SWF::Element::RGB object.  Version is a version number of the SWF.
           It must be 6 and above.

       $movie->FrameRate( $rate )
       $movie->FrameSize( $xmin, $ymin, $xmax, $ymax )
       $movie->BackgroundColor( $color )
           sets the property. See SWF::Builder->new.

       $movie->use_namespace( $namespace )
           prepares ActionScript namespace. For example,
           $movie->use_namespace('SWF.Builder') creates movieclip which is
           initialized by

               if (_global.SWF == undefined) {
                   _global.SWF = new Object();
               }
               if (_global.SWF.Builder == undefined) {
                   _global.SWF.Builder = new Object();
               }

           and place the movieclip on the first frame of the root movie.

       $movie->init_action
           returns SWF::Builder::ActionScript object to initialize the root
           movie.

       $movie->no_namer
       $movie->auto_namer
           deactivate/reactivate auto_namer. Default is active.  Auto_namer
           gives a suitable name to characters and display instances
           automatically when their name is referred before being named
           explicitly.

       $movie->save( $filename )
           saves the movie.

   Character constructors
       $mc->new_shape
           returns a new shape (type: Shape).  See
           SWF::Builder::Character::Shape for the detail.

       $mc->new_font( $fontfile [, $fontname] )
           returns a new font (type: Font).  $fontfile is a font file name. It
           should be a TrueType font file (ttf/ttc).  Optional $fontname is a
           font name referred by HTMLs in dynamic texts.  It is taken from the
           TrueType file if not defined.  See SWF::Builder::Character::Font
           for the detail.

       $mc->new_static_text( [$font, $text] )
           returns a new static text (type: Text), which is fixed by authoring
           and cannot be changed at playing time.  See
           SWF::Builder::Character::Text for the detail of a text.

       $mc->new_edit_text( [$font, $text] )
       $mc->new_dynamic_text( [$font, $text] )
       $mc->new_html_text( [$html] )
       $mc->new_text_area( $width, $height )
       $mc->new_input_field( [$length] )
       $mc->new_password_field( [$length] )
           return new dynamic editable text variations (type: EditText).  See
           SWF::Builder::Character::EditText for the detail.

       $mc->new_movie_clip
       $mc->new_mc
           returns a new movie clip (type: MovieClip).  See
           SWF::Builder::Character::MovieClip for the detail.

       $mc->new_gradient
           returns a new gradient object.  See SWF::Builder::Gradient and
           SWF::Builder::Character::Shape for the detail.

       $mc->new_jpeg( ... )
           returns a new JPEG bitmap (type: Bitmap).  See
           SWF::Builder::Character::Bitmap for the detail.

       $mc->new_bitmap( $obj [, $type] )
           returns a new lossless bitmap (type: Bitmap).  See
           SWF::Builder::Character::Bitmap for the detail.

       $mc->import_asset( $url, $name [, $type] )
           returns a character which will be imported from the SWF movie in
           $url by $name.  This method does not actually import a character
           but put an 'ImportAssets' tag on the movie.  $type is a type of the
           character, such as 'Shape', 'Font', 'Text', 'EditText',
           'MovieClip', and 'Bitmap'.  Default is 'MovieClip'.  This method
           does not check whether a character which has $name and $type is
           actually exported.

   Other methods for movies
       Here describe other common methods for root movie and movie clips.

       $mc->frame_action( $frame )
           returns SWF::Builder::ActionScript object for a frame action.

       $mc->frame_label( $frame, $label [, $anchorflag] )
           gives $label to $frame to which ActionScripts can refer.  If the
           $anchorflag is set to 1, it is accessible as an HTML anchor.

   Characters
       Display and export methods of characters are described here.  See
       SWF::Builder::Character::* for details of type-specific methods.

       $disp_i = $char->place( [ MovieClip => $mc, Frame => $frame, above =>
       $another_i, below => $another_i, clip_with => $mask_i ] )
           places the character on $mc and returns the display instance.  It
           can take four optional named parameters.  'MovieClip'(MC) is a
           parent movie clip on which the character is placed.  The movie clip
           must be under the same root movie with the movie clip in which the
           character is defined.  If MC is not set, the character is placed on
           the movie clip in which it is defined.  'Frame' is a first frame
           number on which the character is placed. Default is 1.  You can set
           the relative depth of the new instance by 'above' and 'below'.
           'clip_with' is a mask instance with which the character is clipped.

           Font character can't place itself.

       $mask_i = $char->place_as_mask( [ MovieClip => $mc, Frame => $frame,
       above => $another_i, below => $another_i ] )
           places the character on $mc as the mask object (clipping layer) and
           returns the mask instance.  It can take optional parameters as same
           as 'place' method except 'clip_with'.  You can handle the mask
           instance as same as the display instance.

           Only Shape and Text characters can place_as_mask.

       $char->name( [$name] )
           gives a name to the character, exports the character, and returns
           the name.  ActionScripts can refer the character as $name.  Other
           movies can import the character by $name.  When you call 'name'
           method without a parameter, the method simply returns the name of
           the character. If the character is not named yet and auto_namer is
           active, auto_namer gives a suitable name.

       $char->export_asset( [$name] )
           Same as $char->name.

   Display instances
       It is necessary to get the display instance to show the defined
       character.  Each instance has its own timeline tied to the parent movie
       clip and the current frame to move, to rotate, etc.

       $disp_i->name( [$name] )
           gives a name to the display instance to which ActionScripts can
           refer and returns the name.  When you call 'name' method without a
           parameter, the method simply returns the name of the character. If
           the character is not named yet and auto_namer is active, auto_namer
           gives a suitable name.

       $fobj = $disp_i->frame( $frame )
           gets the specified frame object of the display instance and sets
           the current frame of the display instance to $frame.

           Moving, rotating, scaling, and any other matrix transforming of the
           display instance are handled in a frame by frame via a frame
           object.  When a frame object is not specified, the 'current frame
           object' kept by the display item is used.  The current frame is
           counted up after it is used.

       $fobj/$disp_i->moveto( $x, $y )
           moves the display item to ($x, $y) at the (current) frame.

       $fobj/$disp_i->r_moveto( $dx, $dy )
           moves the display item relatively ( to (former X + $x, former Y +
           $y)).

       $fobj/$disp_i->scale( $xscale [, $yscale] )
           magnifies/reduces the display item at the (current) frame.  The
           scaling effect is accumulative.

       $fobj/$disp_i->rotate( $angle )
           rotates the display item at the (current) frame.  The rotation
           angle is accumulative.

       $fobj/$disp_i->reset
           resets the rotation and scaling at the (current) frame.

       $fobj/$disp_i->remove
           removes the display instance from the parent movie clip at the
           (current) frame.

       $fobj/$disp_i->matrix
           gets the transformation matrix of the display instance at the
           (current) frame.  The result is an SWF::Element::MATRIX object.

       $fobj/$disp_i->frame_action
       $fobj/$disp_i->frame_label( $label [, $anchorflag] )
           same as those for movie clips, setting the frame number to that of
           the frame object.
