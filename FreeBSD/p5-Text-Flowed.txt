NAME
       Text::Flowed - text formatting routines for RFC2646 format=flowed

SYNOPSIS
        use Text::Flowed qw(reformat quote quote_fixed);

        print reformat($text, {
            quote => 1,
            fixed => 1,
            opt_length => 72,
            max_length => 79
        });

        print quote($text);      # alias for quote => 1
        print quote_fixed(text); # alias for quote => 1, fixed => 1

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides functions that deals with formatting data with
       Content-Type 'text/plain; format=flowed' as described in RFC2646
       (http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2646.txt). In a nutshell,
       format=flowed text solves the problem in plain text files where it is
       not known which lines can be considered a logical paragraph, enabling
       lines to be automatically flowed (wrapped and/or joined) as appropriate
       when displaying.

       In format=flowed, a soft newline is expressed as " \n", while hard
       newlines are expressed as "\n". Soft newlines can be automatically
       deleted or inserted as appropriate when the text is reformatted.

       reformat($text [, \%args])
           The reformat() function takes some format=flowed text as input, and
           reformats it. Paragraphs will be rewrapped to the optimum width,
           with lines being split or combined as necessary.

               my $formatted_text = reformat($text, \%args);

           If $args->{quote} is true, a level of quoting will be added to the
           beginning of every line.

           If $args->{fixed} is true, unquoted lines in $text will be
           interpreted as format=fixed (i.e. leading spaces are interpreted
           literally, and lines will not be joined together). (Set it to 2 to
           make all lines interpreted as format=fixed.) This is useful for
           processing messages posted in web-based forums, which are not
           format=flowed, but preserve paragraph structure due to paragraphs
           not having internal line breaks.

           $args->{max_length} (default 79) is the maximum length of line that
           reformat() or quote() will generate. Any lines longer than this
           length will be rewrapped, unless there is an excessively long word
           that makes this impossible, in which case it will generate a long
           line containing only that word.

           $args->{opt_length} (default 72) is the optimum line length. When
           reformat() or quote() rewraps a paragraph, the resulting lines will
           not exceed this length (except perhaps for excessively long words).

           If a line exceeds opt_length but does not exceed max_length, it
           might not be rewrapped.

       quote($text)
           quote($text) is an alias for reformat($text, {quote => 1}).

               my $quoted_text = quote($text);

       quote_fixed($text)
           quote_fixed($text) is an alias for reformat($text, {quote => 1,
           fixed => 1}).

               my $quoted_text = quote_fixed($text);
