NAME
       Paws - A Perl SDK for AWS (Amazon Web Services) APIs

SYNOPSIS
         use Paws;
         my $obj = Paws->service('...');
         my $res = $obj->MethodCall(Arg1 => $val1, Arg2 => $val2);
         print $res->AttributeFromResult;

DESCRIPTION
       Paws is an attempt to develop an always up-to-date SDK that covers all
       possible AWS services.

STATUS
       Please consider the SDK is beta quality. The intention of publishing to
       CPAN is having the community find the SDK, try it, give feedback, etc.
       Some services are still not working, and some heavy refactoring will
       still be done to the internals. The external interface to SDK users
       will try to be kept stable, and changes to it should be notified via
       ChangeLog

SERVICES CLASSES
       Each service in AWS (EC2, CloudFormation, SQS, SNS, etc) has a service
       class. The service class represents the properties that a web service
       has (how to call it, what methods it has, how to authenticate, etc).
       When a service class is instantiated with the right properties (region,
       if needed, credentials, caller, etc), it will be able to make calls to
       the service.

       Service classes are obtained through

         my $service_class = Paws->class_for_service('Service');
         my $service_object = $service_class->new(region => '...', caller => ...)

       Although they are seldom needed. 99% of the time you want service
       objects directly obtained with the ->service method (read next section)
       since you have to write less code.

SERVICE OBJECTS
       Each Service Object represents the ability to call methods on a service
       endpoint. Those endpoints are either global, or bound to a region
       depending on the service. Also, each object can be customized with a
       credential provider, that tells the object where to obtain credentials
       for the call (you can get them from the environment, from the
       filesystem, from the AWS Instance Profile, STS, etc.

       To obtain a service object, call the "->service" method

         use Paws;
         my $service = Paws->service('Service');

       You can pass extra parameters if the service is bound to a region:

         my $service = Paws->service('Service', region => 'us-east-1');

       These parameters are basically passed to the service class constructor

AUTHENTICATION
       Service classes by default try to authenticate with a chained
       authenticator. The chained authenticator tries to first find
       credentials in your environment variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY and
       AWS_SECRET_KEY (note that AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
       are also scanned for compatibility with the official SDKs). Second, it
       will look for credentials in the default profile of the
       ~/.aws/credentials or the file in AWS_CONFIG_FILE env variable (an ini-
       formatted file). Last, if no environment variables are found, then a
       call to retrieve Role credentials is done. If your instance is running
       on an AWS instance, and has a Role assigned, the SDK will automatically
       retrieve credentials to call any services that the instances Role
       permits.

       Please never burn credentials into your code. That's why the methods
       for passing an explicit access key and secret key are not documented.

       So, instantiating a service with

         my $ec2 = Paws->service('EC2', region => 'eu-west-1');

       we get an service object that will try to authenticate with
       environment, credential file, or an instance role.

       When instantiating a service object, you can also pass a custom
       credential provider:

         use Paws::Credential::STS;

         my $cred_provider = Paws::Credential::STS->new(
           Name => 'MyName',
           DurationSeconds => 900,
           Policy => '{"Version":"2012-10-17","Statement":[{"Effect": "Allow","Action":["ec2:DescribeInstances"],"Resource":"*"}]}'
         );
         my $ec2 = Paws->service('EC2', credentials => $cred_provider, region => 'eu-west-1');

       In this example we instance a service object that uses the STS service
       to create temporary credentials that only let the service object call
       DescribeInstances.

       Paws bundles some pre-baked credential providers:

       Paws::Credential::ProviderChain - Gets credentials from a list of
       providers, returning the first provider to return credentials

       Paws::Credential::Environment - Gets credentials from environment
       variables

       Paws::Credential::File - Gets credentials from AWS SDK config files

       Paws::Credential::InstanceProfile - Gets credentials from the
       InstanceProfile (Role) of the running instance

       Paws::Credential::InstanceProfileV2 - Gets credentials from the
       InstanceProfile (Role) of the running instance using IMDSv2 approach

       Paws::Credential::STS - Gets temporary credentials from the Secure
       Token Service

       Paws::Credential::AssumeRole - Gets temporary credentials with
       AssumeRole

       Paws::Credential::AssumeRoleWithSAML - Gets temporary credentials with
       AssumeRoleWithSAML

       Paws::Credential::Explicit - Gets credentials specified in the code

Using Service objects (Calling APIs)
       Each API call is represented as a method call with the same name as the
       API call. The arguments to the call are passed as lists (named
       parameters) to the call. So, to call DescribeInstances on the EC2
       service:

         my $result = $ec2->DescribeInstances;

       The DescribeInstances call has no required parameters, but if needed,
       we can pass them in (you can look them up in Paws::EC2 and see detail
       in Paws::EC2::DescribeInstances

         my $result = $ec2->DescribeInstances(MaxResults => 5);

       If the parameter is an Array:

         my $result = $ec2->DescribeInstances(InstanceIds => [ 'i-....' ]);

       If the parameter to be passed in is a complex value (an object)

         my $result = $ec2->DescribeInstances(Filters => [ { Name => '', Value => '' } ])

RETURN VALUES
       The AWS APIs return nested datastructures in various formats. The SDK
       converts these datastructures into objects that can then be used as
       wanted.

         my $private_dns = $result->Reservations->[0]->Instances->[0]->PrivateDnsName;

CONFIGURATION
       Paws instances have a configuration. The configuration is basically a
       specification of values that will be passed to the service method each
       time it's called

         # the credentials and the caller keys accept an instance or the name of a class as a
         # string (the class will be loaded and the constructor of that class will be automatically called
         my $paws1 = Paws->new(config => { credentials => MyCredProvider->new, region => 'eu-west-1' });
         my $paws2 = Paws->new(config => { caller => 'MyCustomCaller' });

         # EC2 service with MyCredProvider in eu-west-1
         my $ec2 = $paws1->service('EC2');

         # DynamoDB service with MyCustomCaller in us-east-1. region is needed because it's not in the config
         my $ddb = $paws2->service('DynamoDB', region => 'us-east-1');

         # DynamoDB in eu-west-1 with MyCredProvider
         my $other_ddb = $paws1->service('DynamoDB');

       The attributes that can be configured are:

       credentials

       Accepts a string which value is the name of a class, or an already
       instantiated object. If a string is passed, the class will be loaded,
       and the constructor called (without parameters). Also, the resulting
       instance or the already instantiated object has to have the
       Paws::Credential role.

       caller

       Accepts a string which value is the name of a class, or an already
       instantiated object. If a string is passed, the class will be loaded,
       and the constructor called (without parameters). Also, the resulting
       instance or the already instantiated object has to have the
       Paws::Net::CallerRole role.

       region

       A string representing the region that service objects will be
       instantiated with. Most services need a region specified, meaning that
       you will have to specify the desired region every time you call the
       service method.

         my $cfn = Paws->service('CloudFormation', region => 'eu-west-1');

       Some services (like IAM) are global, so they don't need their region
       specified:

         my $iam = Paws->service('IAM');

       A special service is STS, which by default has a global endpoint, but
       you can also specify regional endpoints

         my $global_sts = Paws->service('STS');
         my $regional_sts = Paws->service('STS', region => 'eu-west-1');

       endpoint

       Paws needs to send HTTP requests to different URLS (endpoints)
       depending on the service and the region. URLs are normally
       automatically derived by specifying the region, but for special cases,
       like pointing to "fake-sqs" or "fake-s3" services, you can:

         Paws->service('SQS', endpoint => 'http://localhost:3000', region => 'eu-west-1');

       Some services, like the MachineLearning predictor API want you to
       specify a custom endpoint:

         my $model = $ml->GetMLModel(MLModelId => $model_id);
         my $predictor = Paws->service('ML', endpoint => $model->EndpointInfo->EndpointUrl, region => 'eu-west-1');
         $predictor->...

       max_attempts

       Sets the total number of request attempts to make per API call, by
       retrying after failures. For most services the value defaults to 5 -
       that is, after a failure, up to 4 retries will be made, making a total
       of up to 5 attempts.

         my $sms = Paws->service('SMS', max_attempts => 10);

   Using VPC Endpoints
       If you are going to consume a service behind a VPC Endpoint, you can
       use the "endpoint" and the "region" attributes to configure Paws
       appropiately

         my $svc = $paws->service('...', endpoint => 'https://endpointaddress', region => 'eu-west-1');

Pluggability
   Credential Provider Pluggability
       Credential classes need to have the Role Paws::Credential applied. This
       obliges them to implement access_key, secret_key and session_token
       methods.  The obtention of this data can be customized to be retrieved
       whereever the developer considers useful (files, environment, other
       services, etc). Take a look at the Paws::Credential::XXXX namespace to
       find already implemented credential providers.

       The credential objects' access_key, secret_key and session_token
       methods will be called each time an API call has to be signed.

   Caller Pluggability
       Caller classes need to have the Role Paws::Net::CallerRole applied.
       This obliges them to implement the do_call method. Tests use this
       interface to mock calls and responses to the APIs (without using the
       network).

       The caller instance is responsable for doing the network Input/Output
       with some type of HTTP request library, and returning the Result from
       the API.

       These callers are included and supported in Paws:

       Paws::Net::Caller: Uses HTTP::Tiny. It's the default caller for Paws

       Paws::Net::MojoAsyncCaller: Experimental asyncronous IO caller. Paws
       method calls return futures instead of results

       Paws::Net::LWPCaller: Uses LWP. LWP supports HTTPS proxies, so Paws can
       call AWS from behind an HTTPS proxy.

       Paws::Net::FurlCaller: Uses Furl: a lightning fast HTTP client

Optimization
   Preloading services and operations
         Paws->preload_service($service)
         Paws->preload_service($service, @methods)

       Paws manages a lot of objects that are loaded dynamically as needed.
       This causes high memory consumption if you do operations with Paws in a
       forked environment because each child loads a separate copy of all the
       classes it needs to do the calls. Paws provides the preload_service
       operation. Call it with the name of the service before forking off so
       your server can benefit from copy on write memory sharing. The parent
       class will load all the classes needed so that child processes don't
       need to load them.

       Some classes have lot's of calls, so preloading them can be quite
       expensive. If you call preload_service with a list of the methods you
       will call, it will only load classes needed for those calls. This is
       specially useful for Paws::EC2, for example.

       Preloading doesn't change the usage of Paws. That means that all
       services and methods still work without any change, just that if
       they're not preloaded they'll be loaded at runtime.

   Immutabilizing classes
       Paws objects are programmed with Moose (the Modern Perl Object
       Framework). Moose objects can be immutibilized so that method calls
       perform better, at the cost of startup time. If you deem your usage of
       Paws to be long-lived, you can call

         Paws->default_config->immutable(1);

       as early as possible in the code. Very important that the immutable
       flag be activated before calling preload_service.
