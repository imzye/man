PORTUPDATE-SCAN(8)      FreeBSD System Manager's Manual     PORTUPDATE-SCAN(8)

NAME
     portupdate-scan – scan /usr/ports/UPDATING, showing sections for
     installed ports

SYNOPSIS
     portupdate-scan [-dhmuVv] [-a yyyymmdd date] [-D portdir] [--help]
                     [--version]

DESCRIPTION
     Reads port-related files, including /usr/ports/UPDATING, and outputs
     those sections of UPDATING that might be pertinent to this system.  Only
     sections that apply to recognize ports that are known, and not installed
     are omitted.

     The following options are available:

     -a yyyymmdd date
             only display sections later than the date specified in yyyymmdd
             format

     -D portsdir
             use portsdir as ports directory instead of /usr/ports

     -d      output additional debugging information

     -h, --help
             output command usage information and exit

     -m      for MIXED sections, show breakdown of which ports are installed
             and not installed. The verbose information from the v flag is a
             superset of this.

     -u      output information on uninstalled ports (default: off)

     -v      output more verbose information

     -V, --version
             output version information and exit

EXIT STATUS
     The portupdate-scan utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error
     occurs.

FILES
     /usr/ports/UPDATING  port update news
     /usr/ports/INDEX     port index file
     /usr/ports/MOVED     record of port renames and deletions

BUGS
     The concept of machine-interpreting the AFFECTS: line in
     /usr/ports/UPDATING, which were intended for human consumption, is
     dubious. It would be nice to evolve some more robust method for
     communicating this information.
