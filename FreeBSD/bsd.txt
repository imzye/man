NAME
     bsd.snmpmod.mk – building modules for bsnmpd(1)

SYNOPSIS
     .include <bsd.snmpmod.mk>

DESCRIPTION
     The file <bsd.snmpmod.mk> simplifies the building of modules for the
     Begemot SNMP daemon, bsnmpd(1).  It provides some common functions for
     building a module and relies on <bsd.lib.mk>, which is included by
     <bsd.snmpmod.mk> to actually build the shared library.

     The following make(1) variables control the special functions:

     MOD               The short name of the module.  The name of the shared
                       library will be snmp_${MOD}.so.  There must exist a
                       file ${MOD}_tree.def for compilation with
                       gensnmptree(1) which contains the definition of the MIB
                       tree implemented by the module.

     EXTRAMIBDEFS      A list of extra MIB definition files for
                       gensnmptree(1).  This is optional.  This file list is
                       given to both calls to gensnmptree(1) — the one that
                       extracts the symbols in XSYM from the MIB definitions
                       and the one that generates the table with OIDs served
                       by this module.

     EXTRAMIBSYMS      A list of extra MIB definition files for
                       gensnmptree(1).  This is optional.  This file list is
                       given only to the call to gensnmptree(1) that extracts
                       symbols from MIB definition files.  It is useful if
                       there are dependencies on other MIBs or for extracting
                       global definitions for enumeration constants.

     XSYM              A list of symbols to be extracted from the MIB
                       definition files by gensnmptree(1).  This is optional.

     DEFS              A list of MIB definition files to be installed.  This
                       is optional.

     BMIBS             A list of textual MIBs to be installed.  This is
                       optional.

     Three files are automatically created from the MIB definition files and
     the XSYM variable:

     ${MOD}_tree.c     This contains a table with the tree implemented by the
                       module.  It is automatically included into the SRCS
                       variable.

     ${MOD}_tree.h     This contains preprocessor defines for all the OIDs
                       defined by the module and can be included in the
                       module's source code.

     ${MOD}_oid.h      OID preprocessor definitions for all the symbols listed
                       in XSYMS.  This is to be included into the module's
                       source code.
