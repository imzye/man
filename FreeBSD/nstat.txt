NSTAT(1)                FreeBSD General Commands Manual               NSTAT(1)

NAME
     nstat – Display various stats.

SYNOPSIS
     nstat [-m] [wait]

DESCRIPTION
     The nstat utility will display system stats similar to netstat and
     vmstat.


     The options are as follows: -m run pcm-memory.x and report memory
     bandwidth statistics

     -r Report raw, unscaled, CPU percentage rather than scaling CPU
     percentage by the current CPU clock frequency.

     -s Report network bandwidth statistics in slower units (Mbps rather than
     Gbps and Kpps rather than Mpps).  Repeating the flag reduces units
     further.

     -t Precede each report with a timestamp.

EXAMPLES
     The command:
           netstat -m 10
     will print what the system is doing every 10 seconds, including reporting
     memory bandwith.
