NAME
       Digest::JHash - Perl extension for 32 bit Jenkins Hashing Algorithm

SYNOPSIS
           use Digest::JHash qw(jhash);

           $digest = jhash($data);

           # note that calling jhash() directly like this is the fastest way:

           $digest = Digest::JHash::jhash($data);

DESCRIPTION
       The "Digest::JHash" module allows you to use the fast JHash hashing
       algorithm developed by Bob Jenkins from within Perl programs. The
       algorithm takes as input a message of arbitrary length and produces as
       output a 32-bit "message digest" of the input in the form of an
       unsigned long integer.

       Call it a low calorie version of MD5 if you like.

       See http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/doobs.html for more information.

FUNCTIONS
       jhash($data)
           This function will calculate the JHash digest of the "message" in
           $data and return a 32 bit integer result (an unsigned long in the
           C)

EXPORTS
       None by default but you can have the jhash() function if you ask
       nicely.  See below for reasons not to use Exporter (it is slower than a
       direct call)

SPEED NOTE
       If speed is a major issue it is roughly twice as fast to do call the
       jhash() function like Digest::JHash::jhash('message') than it is to
       import the jhash() method using Exporter so you can call it as simply
       jhash('message').  There is a short script that demonstrates the speed
       of different calling methods (direct, OO and Imported) in
       examples/oo_vs_func.pl
