NAME
       News::Article::NoCeM - a module to generate accurate nocem notices

SYNOPSIS
         use News::Article::NoCeM;
         my $nocem = new News::Article::NoCeM();

         $nocem->hide($type, $spam);
         $nocem->make_notice($type, $name, $issuer, $group, $prefix);
         $nocem->sign($keyid, $passphrase);
         $nocem->issue($conn, $ihave);

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a nocem notice on the Usenet articles, which may be posted
       normally to hide the messages.

USAGE
       use News::Article::NoCeM;

       News::Article::NoCeM is class that inherits News::Article and adds four
       new functions: hide(), make_notice(), sign() and issue(), redefine to
       disable two functions: post() and ihave().

   Article Methods
       hide ( TYPE, ARTICLE, [ARTICLE, ...] )
           Hide one or more articles in the given "TYPE".  "ARTICLE" is an
           News::Article object that going to be hid. hide() will skip the
           articles without Newsgroup or Message-ID and skip the ones already
           hid.

           hide() returns the number of the articles hid.

       post
       ihave
           post() and ihave() is disabled in News::Article::NoCeM.  Please use
           issue() instead.

       make_notice ( TYPE, NAME, GROUP, ISSUER, [ PREFIX ] )
           Retrieve articles marked by hide with "TYPE", and make a notice fot
           them. If there's only one type within a container, then the
           container itself can be a notice. "NAME" is the identifier of the
           issuer. "GROUP" is the newsgroup the you will post nocem notice to.
           "ISSUER" is the email address of the issuer. "PREFIX" is the
           announcement before the nocem notice, which may explain the
           criteria of this notice, or where to find your public key for PGP
           verification.

           make_notice() returns a News::Article::NoCeM object if success, and
           return undef if no article is hid.

       sign ( KEYID, PASSPHRASE )
           Sign the content of the nocem notice with "KEYID" and "PASSPHRASE".
           Please make sure that the issuer's public/secret keyring is ready.

           sign() returns a News::Article::NoCeM object if success, and return
           undef if no article is hid, or pgp_sign failed.

       issue ( [ CONN, IHAVE ] )
           Take optional "CONN" as a Net::NNTP object and issue the nocem
           notice.  "IHAVE" indicates that call Net::NNTP::ihave() for
           submitting the notice, otherwise issue() will call
           News::Article::post() by default.

           issue() return the result of News::Article::post() or issue().

NOTES
       Standard article manipulation information can be read in the
       News::Article manpages.
