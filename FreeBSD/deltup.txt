DELTUP(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              DELTUP(1)

NAME
       deltup - Update a tarballed package

SYNOPSIS
       deltup -m[fvej] [bg #] [[-dD] repository ] package1 package2 patchfile
       #make patch

       deltup -p[fvir] [[-dD] repository ] <patchfiles> #apply patches



DESCRIPTION
       Makes and applies patches to tarballed packages.  edelta is an alias
       which passes -d <portage distfiles dir> to deltup.

OPTIONS
       -f     Force overwrite if output file already exists

       -v     Verbose mode

       -e     This special option tells deltup to test the patch against all
              available compressors and write info about which ones work into
              the patch file

       -j     Use bdelta instead of xdelta when creating the patch.  This
              version of Deltup has built-in support for applying bdelta
              patches, which makes installing xdelta unnecessary.

       -b, -g Filter patch through bzip2 or gzip

       -i     Show what files would be patched without performing any actions.

       -r     Apply series of patches to one package without outputting the
              packages in between.

       -d     Output packages to directory repository

       -d     Find packages to upgrade in directory repository

ENVIORNMENT
       TMPDIR Directory to output temporary files.  If not defined then /tmp
              is used.

EXAMPLES
       Make bzip2'd Gentoo package patch:
              edelta -m -b 9 OldPackage NewPackage PatchFile

       Apply the patch:
              edelta -p PatchFile

       Make verified patch with the -e option:
              edelta -me -b 9 Package-v1.tar.bz2 Package-v2.tar.bz2
              Package_Patch.dtu
