BT3CFW(8)               FreeBSD System Manager's Manual              BT3CFW(8)

NAME
     bt3cfw – firmware download utility for 3Com Bluetooth PC card driver

SYNOPSIS
     bt3cfw [-h] -f Firmware_file_name -n Netgraph_node_name

DESCRIPTION
     The bt3cfw utility connects to the specified Netgraph driver node of type
     BTCCC and downloads the specified firmware file.

     Due to copyright issues, I will no longer provide firmware with the card
     driver.  The firmware can be obtained from the Windows driver package
     that can be downloaded from the 3COM web site at no charge.  The firmware
     name is BT3CPCC.BIN.  I am using the original firmware that came with the
     card on CD-ROM.

           MD5 (BT3CPCC.BIN) = 36170fda56ea9fdbf1702c966f8a97f1

     The options are as follows:

     -f Firmware_file_name
             Specify firmware file name for download.

     -h      Display usage message and exit.

     -n Netgraph_node_name
             Connect to the specified Netgraph driver node of type BTCCC.

EXIT STATUS
     The bt3cfw utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
