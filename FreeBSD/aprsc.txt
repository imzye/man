NAME
       aprsc - An APRS-IS network server

SYNOPSIS
       aprsc [-t chrootdir] [-u setuid_username] [-c config_file_name] [-f]
       [-n logname] [-r log_dir] [-e loglevel_token] [-o logdestination_token]
       [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       The aprsc (pronounced a-purrs-c) is a plain APRS-IS server intended to
       be used on the core and Tier2 APRS-IS servers.  It is written in the C
       language, and it runs on Linux and Unix servers.

       If you need igate or other radio-interfacing features, the aprsc is not
       for you.

OPTIONS
       The aprsc has following runtime options:

       -t chrootdir
              Run the aprsc in a chroot(2) subdirectory.  Use also the -u
              option below.

       -u setuid_username
              When running the aprsc in chroot(2) subdirectory, it should be
              running there with a non-privileged user account.  This option
              defines that account, which must be found at the system account
              database.

       -c config_file_name
              Define explicit configuration file name.  Default is
              "aprsc.conf" in current directory.

       -f
              fork(2) the program ro tun in the background.

       -n logname
              Define a name by which this instance of the aprsc is known in
              the log.  Useful when you have multiple instances running.

       -r log_dir
              For file based logging, do it all in given directory.  There is
              no default log directory.

       -e loglevel_token
              The supported tokens are following with their corresponding
              priority values EMERG(0), ALERT(1), CRIT(2), ERROR(3),
              WARNING(4), NOTICE(5), INFO(6), DEBUG(7).  This option defines a
              logging cutoff where events with higher numeric value than the
              given cutoff are dropped internally.  The default cutoff is
              INFO.

       -o logdestination_token
              The supported tokens are following: none, stderr, syslog, and
              file.

LOGGING
       The logging has multiple options:

       none
              Disable logging completely

       stderr
              Log to stderr of the running users console session Do not use
              this when runtime option -f is being used.

       syslog
              Use syslog(3) mechanism to send logging events to system
              syslogd(8), When running under chroot(2) this may require that
              the syslogd is configured to have log event receiving named
              socket within that chroot area.

       file
              The logging goes to configured directory using file names:
              aprsc.log, and aprsc.access.log.  which autorotate with up to N
              older versions, each with M megabytes of size when the rotation
              happens.  Configuration of N and M is done with aprsc.conf(7).
