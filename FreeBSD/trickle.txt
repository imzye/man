TRICKLE(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             TRICKLE(1)

NAME
     trickle – a lightweight userspace bandwidth shaper

SYNOPSIS
     trickle [-h] [-v] [-V] [-s] [-d rate] [-u rate] [-w length] [-t time]
             [-l length] [-n path] command ...

DESCRIPTION
     trickle is a userspace bandwidth manager.  Currently, trickle supports
     the shaping of any SOCK_STREAM (see socket(2)) connection established via
     the socket(2) interface.  Furthermore, trickle will not work with
     statically linked executables, nor with setuid(2) executables.  trickle
     is highly configurable; download and upload rates can be set separately,
     or in an aggregate fashion.

     The options are as follows:

     -h           Displays help.

     -v           Increases the verbosity level (can be specified multiple
                  times).

     -V           Prints version.

     -s           Runs trickle in standalone mode, independent of trickled(8).

     -d rate      Limit the download bandwidth consumption to rate KB/s.

     -u rate      Limit the upload bandwidth consumption to rate KB/s.

     -w length    Set peak detection window size to length KB.  This
                  determines how aggressive trickle is at eliminating
                  bandwidth consumption peaks.  Lower values will be more
                  aggressive, but may also result in over shaping.  The
                  default value (512 KB) is usually sufficient.

     -t seconds   Set smoothing time to seconds s.  The smoothing time
                  determines with what intervals trickle will try to let the
                  application transcieve data.  Smaller values will result in
                  a more continuous (smooth) session, while larger values may
                  produce bursts in the sending and receiving data.  Smaller
                  values (0.1 - 1 s) are ideal for interactive applications
                  while slightly larger values (1 - 10 s) are better for
                  applications that need bulk transfer.

     -l length    Set smoothing length to length KB.  The smoothing length is
                  a fallback of the smoothing time.  If trickle cannot meet
                  the requested smoothing time, it will instead fall back on
                  sending length KB of data.  The default value is 10 KB.

     -n path      Use trickled(8) socket path to communicate with trickled(8).
                  By default, /tmp/.trickled.sock is used.

EXAMPLES
     trickle -u 10 -d 20 ncftp

     Launch ncftp(1) limiting its upload capacity to 10 KB/s, and download
     capacity at 20 KB/s.

BUGS
     Does not support executables utilizing kqueue(2).  Does not support
     statically linked executables.
