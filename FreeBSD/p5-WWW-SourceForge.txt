   new
        Usage     : my $sfapi = new WWW::SourceForge;
        Returns   : WWW::SourceForge object

       Optionally pass an 'api' argument to select one of the other APIs.

           my $download_api = WWW::SourceForge->new( api => 'download' );

       See
       https://sourceforge.net/p/forge/documentation/Download%20Stats%20API/

   call
        Usage : my $json = $sfapi->call(
                       method => whatever,
                       arg1   => 'value',
                       arg2   => 'another value',
                       format => 'rss',
                       );
        Returns : Hashref, containing a bunch of data. Format defaults to
            'json', but in some cases, you'll want to force rss because that's
            how the return is available. Will try to make this smarter
            eventually.

       Calls a particular method in the SourceForge API. Other args are passed
       as args to that call.
