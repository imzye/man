NAME
       pbm2hp - printer driver of PBM-P4-file for HP Laserjet printers

SYNOPSIS
       pbm2hp infile

DESCRIPTION
       Pbm2hp reads a PBM file in P4 format and produces a HP Laserjet output
       for 300 dpi.  The output is send to stdout.  This tool can be used to
       print out the image produced as export output of the VCG tool from a
       graph.

WARNING
       This utility does not work with the PBM-P1-format !!!  It is not a
       general conversion utility but only a small demonstration how to deal
       with the output of the VCG tool.  There are excellent standard
       utilities for PBM-Files by Jef Poskanzer (pbmtolj) but pbm2hp should be
       much faster on large files.
