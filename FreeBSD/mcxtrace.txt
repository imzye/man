NAME
       mcxtrace - Compiler of the McXrace X-ray trace simulation package

SYNOPSIS
       mcxtrace [-o file][-I dir1 ...][-tv][--verbose] file.instr

DESCRIPTION
       The mcxtrace command is the instrument compiler of the McXtrace
       package.

       McXtrace is a general tool for simulating x-ray scattering instruments
       and experiments. It is actively supported by DTU Physics, ESRF, and
       University of Copenhagen


       McXtrace is based on a compiler [mcxtrace(1)] that reads a high-level
       specification language defining the instrument to be simulated and
       produces C code that performs the Monte Carlo Simulation. The system is
       very fast in use, both when setting up the instrument definition and
       when doing calculations.

       McStas supports all x-ray scattering instruments. It comes with a
       comprehensive manual and a library of well-tested components that
       include most standard elements of x-ray scattering instruments,
       including steady-state and pulsed sources, monochromators/analysers,
       powder samples, choppers, and a variety of detectors.

       To start mcxtrace, use: mxgui(1)

       The package consists of the following user commands:

       mxgui(1)
              is the graphical user interface. Then use the X-ray Site menu to
              select an example instrument, and access the whole documentation
              for the Help menu. It contains an instrument editor, methods to
              plot simulation results, and much more

       mxrun(1)
              is the command-line tool for building and running simulations

       mxplot(1)
              is the simulation results plotting tool

       mxdisplay(1)
              is the instrument geometry and photon trajectory viewer

       mxdoc(1)
              is the documentation tool

       mcxtrace(1)
              is the instrument compiler

       mxformat(1)
              can transform any text data set from one format to an other. It
              does not support conversion from binary data sets. It can also
              merge equivalent results.

       We encourage users to refer to the User and Component Manuals, which
       are available with the command mxdoc

OPTIONS
       -h | --help
              displays the command help

       -t | --trace
              Enable 'trace' mode for instrument display.

       -v | --version
              Prints McXtrace version.

       --verbose
              Display compilation process steps.

INSTRUMENT OPTIONS
       These options apply to the generated instrument code (foo.c and
       foo.out)

       -s SEED | --seed=SEED
              Set random seed (must be non zero)

       -n COUNT | --ncount=COUNT
              Set number of x-rays to simulate

       -d DIR | --dir=DIR
              Put all data files in directory DIR

       -f FILE | --file=FILE
              Put all data in a single file

       -t | --trace
              Enable trace of x-ray through instrument (must have been set
              during code generation with mcxtrace(1)). This is necessary for
              mxdisplay(1) to run

       -a | --data-only
              Do not put any headers in the data files

       --no-output-files
              Do not write any data files

       -h | --help
              Show help message for the instrument

       -i | --info
              Detailed instrument information, including valid parameters

       --format=FORMAT
              Output data files using format FORMAT (format list obtained from
              foo.out -h, e.g. Matlab, Scilab, PGPLOT, HTML, XML, IDL, VRML,
              Python, Octave)

EXAMPLES
       The three following examples are equivalent to the single command:
        mxrun -c foo.instr param1=value1 ...

       Typical usage (creates a C file to be compiled)
              mcxtrace foo.instr

       gcc -O -o foo.out foo.c -lm
              Compile the instrument (with basic optimization and math
              libraries)

       foo.out param1=value1 ...
              Execute instrument simulation

ENVIRONMENT
       The MCXTRACE environment variable may be set to define the McStas
       library location. This is /usr/local/lib/mcstas on Linux systems.
       Executables are usually located in /usr/local/bin.  The default
       McXtrace configuration file is MCXTRACE/tools/perl/mcstas_config.perl,
       but may be overridden on the user level by putting a copy in
       HOME/.mcxtrace/.

       The MCXTRACE_FORMAT environment variable may be set to define the
       default data format used for storing results. This is usually 'PGPLOT'.

BUGS
       McXtrace is a large package, and bugs might be found. If so, please
       report to http://trac.mccode.org and the mailing list
       mcxtrace-users@mcxtrace.org

EXIT STATUS
       mcxtrace returns 1 in case of error, 0 when all went fine
