NG_ETHER_ECHO(4)       FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual       NG_ETHER_ECHO(4)

NAME
     ng_ether_echo – netgraph ether_echo node type

SYNOPSIS
     #include <netgraph/ng_ether_echo.h>

DESCRIPTION
     The ether_echo node type reflects all data and control messages back to
     the sender.  It assumes (and does not check) that the packet is an
     ethernet frame, and swaps the source and destination addresses before
     echoing it.  This node type is used for testing and debugging.

HOOKS
     A ether_echo node accepts any request to connect, regardless of the hook
     name, as long as the name is unique.

CONTROL MESSAGES
     This node type supports only the generic control messages.  Any other
     control messages are reflected back to the sender.

SHUTDOWN
     This node shuts down upon receipt of a NGM_SHUTDOWN control message, or
     when all hooks have been disconnected.

SEE ALSO
     netgraph(4), ng_echo(4), ng_ether(4), ng_hole(4), ngctl(8)

HISTORY
     The ng_ether_echo node type was implemented in FreeBSD 8.0.
