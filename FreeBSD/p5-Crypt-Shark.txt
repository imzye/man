NAME
       Crypt::Shark - Crypt::CBC compliant block cipher

ABSTRACT
       Shark is 64-bit block cipher that accepts a 128-bit key.

SYNOPSIS
           use Crypt::Shark;

           $cipher = new Crypt::Shark $key;
           $ciphertext = $cipher->encrypt($plaintext);
           $plaintext  = $cipher->decrypt($ciphertext);

DESCRIPTION
       Shark is 64-bit block cipher that accepts a 128-bit key. It was
       designed by Vincent Rijmen, Joan Daemen, Bart Preneel, Antoon
       Bosselaers, and Erik De Win.

       This module supports the Crypt::CBC interface, with the following
       functions.

   Functions
       blocksize
           Returns the size (in bytes) of the block (8, in this case).

       keysize
           Returns the size (in bytes) of the key (16, in this case).

       encrypt($data)
           Encrypts 8 bytes of $data and returns the corresponding ciphertext.

       decrypt($data)
           Decrypts 8 bytes of $data and returns the corresponding plaintext.

EXAMPLE 1
           #!/usr/local/bin/perl

           use diagnostics;
           use strict;
           use warnings;
           use Crypt::Shark;

           # key must be 16 bytes long
           my $key = "0123456789abcdef";

           my $cipher = new Crypt::Shark $key;

           print "blocksize = ", $cipher->blocksize, " bytes \n";
           print "keysize = ", $cipher->keysize, " bytes \n";

           # block must be 8 bytes long
           my $plaintext1 = "01234567";

           my $ciphertext = $cipher->encrypt($plaintext1);
           my $plaintext2 = $cipher->decrypt($ciphertext);

           print "Decryption OK\n" if ($plaintext1 eq $plaintext2);

EXAMPLE 2
           #!/usr/local/bin/perl

           use diagnostics;
           use strict;
           use warnings;
           use Crypt::CBC;  # CBC automatically loads Shark for us

           # when using Crypt::CBC, key may be of ANY length
           my $key = "0123456789abcdef";

           # IV must be exactly 16 bytes long
           my $IV = pack "H16", 0;

           my $cipher = Crypt::CBC->new({'key' => $key,
                                         'cipher' => 'Shark',
                                         'iv' => $IV,
                                         'regenerate_key' => 1,
                                         'padding' => 'standard',
                                         'prepend_iv' => 0
                                       });

           # when using Crypt::CBC, plaintext may be of ANY length
           my $plaintext1 = "This is a test";

           my $ciphertext = $cipher->encrypt($plaintext1);
           my $plaintext2 = $cipher->decrypt($ciphertext);

           print "Decryption OK\n" if ($plaintext1 eq $plaintext2);
