NAME
       Encode::Base32::Crockford - encode/decode numbers using Douglas
       Crockford's Base32 Encoding

VERSION
       version 2.112991

DESCRIPTION
       Douglas Crockford describes a Base32 Encoding at
       <http://www.crockford.com/wrmg/base32.html>. He says: "[Base32 Encoding
       is] a 32-symbol notation for expressing numbers in a form that can be
       conveniently and accurately transmitted between humans and computer
       systems."

       This module provides methods to convert numbers to and from that
       notation.

SYNOPSIS
           use Encode::Base32::Crockford qw(:all); # import all methods

       or

           use Encode::Base32::Crockford qw(base32_decode); # your choice of methods

           my $decoded = base32_decode_with_checksum("16JD");
           my $encoded = base32_encode_with_checksum(1234);

METHODS
   base32_encode
           print base32_encode(1234); # prints "16J"

       Encode a base 10 number. Will die on inappropriate input.

   base32_encode_with_checksum
           print base32_encode_with_checksum(1234); # prints "16JD"

       Encode a base 10 number with a checksum symbol appended. See the spec
       for a description of the checksum mechanism. Wraps the previous method
       so will also die on bad input.

   base32_decode
           print base32_decode("16J"); # prints "1234"

           print base32_decode("IO", { mode => "warn"   }); # print "32" but warn
           print base32_decode("IO", { mode => "strict" }); # dies

       Decode an encoded number into base 10. Will die on inappropriate input.
       The function is case-insensitive, and will strip any hyphens in the
       input (see normalize()). A hashref of options may be passed, with the
       only valid option being "mode". If set to "warn", normalization will
       produce a warning; if set to "strict", requiring normalization will
       cause a fatal error.

   base32_decode_with_checksum
           print base32_decode_with_checksum("16JD"); # prints "1234"

       Decode an encoded number with a checksum into base 10. Will die if the
       checksum isn't correct, and die on inappropriate input. Takes the same
       "mode" option as "base32_decode".

   normalize
           my $string = "ix-Lb-Ko";
           my $clean = normalize($string);

           # $string is now '1X1BK0'.

       The spec allows for certain symbols in encoded strings to be read as
       others, to avoid problems with misread strings. This function will
       perform the following conversions in the input string:

       •   "i" or "I" to 1

       •   "l" or "L" to 1

       •   "o" or "O" to 0

       It will also remove any instances of "-" in the input, which are
       permitted by the spec as chunking symbols to aid human reading of an
       encoded string, and uppercase the output.
