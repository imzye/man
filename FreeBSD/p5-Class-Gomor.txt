NAME
       Class::Gomor - another class and object builder

DESCRIPTION
       This module is yet another class builder. This one adds parameter
       checking in new constructor, that is to check for attributes existence,
       and definedness.

       In order to validate parameters, the module needs to find attributes,
       and that is the reason for declaring attributes in global variables
       named @AS, @AA, @AO. They respectively state for Attributes Scalar,
       Attributes Array and Attributes Other. The last one is used to avoid
       autocreation of accessors, that is to let you declare your own ones.

       Attribute validation is performed by looking at classes hierarchy, by
       following @ISA tree inheritance.

       The loss in speed by validating all attributes is quite negligeable on
       a decent machine (Pentium IV, 2.4 GHz) with Perl 5.8.x. But if you want
       to avoid checking, you can do it, see below.

       This class is the base class for Class::Gomor::Array and
       Class::Gomor::Hash, so they will inherite the following methods.

GLOBAL VARIABLES
       $NoCheck
           Import it in your namespace like this:

           use Class::Gomor qw($NoCheck);

           If you want to disable cgCheckParams to improve speed once your
           program is frozen, you can use this variable. Set it to 1 to
           disable parameter checking.

       $Debug
           Import it in your namespace like this:

           use Class::Gomor qw($Debug);

           This variable is used by the cgDebugPrint method.

METHODS
       cgCheckParams (hash ref, array ref)
           The attribute checking method takes two arguments, the first is
           user passed attributes (as a hash reference), the second is the
           list of valid attributes, gathered via cgGetAttributes method (as
           an array ref). A message is displayed if passed parameters are not
           valid.

       cgGetIsaTree (array ref)
           A recursive method. You pass a class in an array reference as an
           argument, and then the @ISA array is browsed, recursively. The
           array reference passed as an argument is increased with new
           classes, pushed into it. It returns nothing, result is stored in
           the array ref.

       cgGetAttributes
           This method returns available attributes for caller's object class.
           It uses cgGetIsaTree to search recursively in class hierarchy. It
           then returns an array reference with all possible attributes.

       cgBuildAccessorsScalar (array ref)
           Accessor creation method. Takes an array reference containing all
           scalar attributes to create. Scalar accessors are stored in a
           global variable names @AS. So you call this method at the beginning
           of your class like that:

           __PACKAGE__->cgBuildAccessorsScalar(\@AS);

       cgBuildAccessorsArray (array ref)
           Accessor creation method. Takes an array reference containing all
           array attributes to create. Array accessors are stored in a global
           variable names @AA. So you call this method at the beginning of
           your class like that:

           __PACKAGE__->cgBuildAccessorsArray(\@AA);

       cgClone [ (scalar) ]
           You can clone one of your objects by calling this method. An
           optional parameter may be used to create multiple clones. Cloning
           will occure only on the first level attributes, that is, if you
           have attributes containing other objects, they will not be cloned.

       cgFullClone [ (scalar) ]
           This method is the same as cgClone, but will clone all attributes
           recursively, but only if they are subclassed from Class::Gomor. So,
           objects created with other modules than Class::Gomor::Array or
           Class::Gomor::Hash will not be cloned.

           Another thing to note, there is no catch for cycling references
           (when you link two objects with each others). You have been warned.

       cgDebugPrint (scalar, scalar)
           First argument is a debug level. It is compared with global $Debug,
           and if it is less than it, the second argument (a message string)
           is displayed. This method exists because I use it, maybe you will
           not like it.
