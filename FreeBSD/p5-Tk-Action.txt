NAME
       Tk::Action - action abstraction for tk

VERSION
       version 1.093390

SYNOPSIS
           my $action = Tk::Action->new(
               window   => $mw,
               callback => \&jfdi,
           );
           $action->add_widget( $menu_entry );
           $action->add_widget( $button );
           $action->add_binding( '<Control-F>' );
           $action->enable;
           ...
           $action->disable;

DESCRIPTION
       Menu entries are often also available in toolbars or other widgets. And
       sometimes, we want to enable or disable a given action, and this means
       having to update everywhere this action is allowed.

       This module helps managing actions in a Tk GUI: just create a new
       object, associate some widgets and bindings with add_widget() and then
       de/activate the whole action at once with enable() or disable().

ATTRIBUTES
   callback
       The callback associated to the action. It is needed to create the
       shortcut bindings. Required, no default.

   window
       The window holding the widgets being part of the action object. It is
       needed to create the shortcut bindings. Required, no default.

METHODS
   $action->add_widget( $widget );
       Associate $widget with $action. Enable or disable it depending on
       current action status.

   $action->rm_widget( $widget );
       De-associate $widget from C$<action>.

   $action->add_binding( $binding );
       Associate $binding with $action. Enable or disable it depending on
       current action status. $binding is a regular binding, as defined by
       Tk::bind.

       It is not possible to remove a binding from an action.

   $action->enable;
       Activate all associated widgets and shortcuts.

   $action->disable;
       De-activate all associated widgets and shortcuts.
