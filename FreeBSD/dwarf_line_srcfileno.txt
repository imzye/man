     descriptor

LIBRARY
     DWARF Access Library (libdwarf, -ldwarf)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <libdwarf.h>

     int
     dwarf_lineaddr(Dwarf_Line ln, Dwarf_Addr *ret, Dwarf_Error *err);

     int
     dwarf_linebeginstatement(Dwarf_Line ln, Dwarf_Bool *ret,
         Dwarf_Error *err);

     int
     dwarf_lineblock(Dwarf_Line ln, Dwarf_Bool *ret, Dwarf_Error *err);

     int
     dwarf_lineendsequence(Dwarf_Line ln, Dwarf_Bool *ret, Dwarf_Error *err);

     int
     dwarf_lineno(Dwarf_Line ln, Dwarf_Unsigned *ret, Dwarf_Error *err);

     int
     dwarf_lineoff(Dwarf_Line ln, Dwarf_Signed *ret, Dwarf_Error *err);

     int
     dwarf_linesrc(Dwarf_Line ln, char **ret, Dwarf_Error *err);

     int
     dwarf_line_srcfileno(Dwarf_Line ln, Dwarf_Unsigned *ret,
         Dwarf_Error *err);

DESCRIPTION
     These functions retrieve specific line information associated with the
     line descriptor specified by argument ln, and stores it in the location
     pointed to by argument ret.  If argument err is not NULL, it will be used
     to store error information in case of an error.

     Function dwarf_lineaddr() stores the program address corresponding to the
     source line specified in argument ln into the location pointed to by
     argument ret.

     Function dwarf_linebeginstatement() sets the location pointed to by
     argument ret to 1 if the source line specified by the line descriptor ln
     is the beginning of a statement, or to 0 otherwise.

     Function dwarf_lineblock() sets the location pointed to by argument ret
     to 1 if the source line specified by the line descriptor ln is the
     beginning of a basic block, or to 0 otherwise.

     Function dwarf_lineendsequence() sets the location pointed to by argument
     ret to 1 if the program address associated with the line descriptor ln is
     the address immediately following the end of a sequence of target machine
     instructions, or to 0 otherwise.

     Function dwarf_lineno() stores the line number of the source line
     associated with the line descriptor ln into the location pointed to by
     argument ret.

     Function dwarf_lineoff() stores the column number within a line
     associated with descriptor ln into the location pointed to by argument
     ret.  The retrieved column numbers are 1-based, with the value -1
     indicating that column number information was not available.

     Function dwarf_linesrc() stores a pointer to a NUL-terminated string
     containing the source file name associated with line descriptor ln into
     the location pointed to by argument ret.  The full path of the source
     file is returned if possible.  The memory used for the source file name
     string is managed by the DWARF(3) library and should not be directly
     freed by application code.  Instead, portable code should use
     dwarf_dealloc(3) to indicate that the string should be freed.

     Function dwarf_line_srcfileno() stores the index of the source file
     associated with the line descriptor ln in the location pointed to by
     argument ret.  The returned value is 1-based index into the array of
     source file names returned by dwarf_srcfiles(3).

RETURN VALUES
     On success, these functions returns DW_DLV_OK.  In case of an error, they
     return DW_DLV_ERROR and set the argument err.

ERRORS
     These functions may fail with the following errors:

     [DW_DLE_ARGUMENT]                Either of the arguments ln or ret was
                                      NULL.

     [DW_DLE_LINE_FILE_NUM_BAD]       The source file name associated with the
                                      line descriptor ln could not be
                                      retrieved by function dwarf_linesrc().
