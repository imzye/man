FCRONDYN(1)                                                        FCRONDYN(1)



NAME
       fcrondyn - dialog dyn-amically with a running fcron daemon

SYNOPSIS
       fcrondyn [ -c file ] [ -i ]


       fcrondyn [ -c file ] -x command


       fcrondyn [ -h ]


DESCRIPTION
       Fcrondyn is a user tool intended to interact with a running fcron
       daemon. It can, for instance, list user's jobs loaded by fcron, run one
       of them, renice a running job, send a signal to a running job, etc.

OPTIONS
       -i     Run fcrondyn in interactive mode. fcrondyn is also run in
              interactive mode when no option is given.

       -x command
              Run command and returns immediately. See below for syntax and a
              list of commands.

       -c file
              Make fcrondyn use config file file instead of default config
              file /usr/local/etc/fcron.conf. To interact with a running fcron
              process, fcrondyn must use the same config file as the process.
              That way, several fcron processes can run simultaneously on an
              only system.

       -d     Run in debug mode. In this mode, many informational messages
              will be output in order to check if anything went wrong.

       -h     Display a brief description of the options.

       -V     Display an informational message about fcrondyn, including its
              version and the license under which it is distributed.

COMMAND DESCRIPTION
       Fcrondyn's command syntax is the following:


              command arg1 arg2 [...]

       An argument of a fcrondyn command is of one of the following type:
       "ARGUMENT TYPES OF FCRONDYN'S COMMANDS"

       user   A valid user name.

       jobid  A job id given by one of fcrondyn's ls* commands (i.e. an
              integer).

       sig    A signal number, or its name (case does not matter).  For
              instance, "term" or "15".

       niceval
              A job priority value. A niceval is an integer from -20 (highest
              priority) to 19 (lowest) (only root is allowed to use a negative
              value with this option).

       Last, but not least, the following commands are recognized (optional
       arguments are between []): "VALID FCRONDYN'S COMMANDS"

       help

       h      Print an help message about fcrondyn's commands.

       quit

       q      In interactive mode, quit fcrondyn.

       ls [user]
              List all jobs of user. When ls is run by root, all users are
              listed unless a user name is given as argument. See below for
              some explanations about the fields used by ls* commands.

       ls_lavgq [user]
              Same as ls, but list only the jobs which are in the load-average
              queue (i.e. which are waiting for a lower load average to be
              run).

       ls_serialq [user]
              Same as ls, but list only the jobs which are in the serial queue
              (i.e. which are waiting for other jobs to be finished).

       ls_exeq [user]
              Same as ls, but list only the jobs which are running.

       detail jobid
              Print details about a job. jobid is the one given by ls.

       runnow jobid
              Instead of waiting for the next scheduled execution time, run
              the job now. The next execution time is changed as if the job
              had run on schedule.

       run jobid
              Run the job now. Its next execution time is not changed.

       kill sig jobid
              Send a signal to a running job.

       renice niceval jobid
              Change the priority of a running job.  "FIELDS USED BY DETAIL
              AND     LS* COMMANDS"

       ID     Job's unique identification number.

       USER   User who owns this job.

       PID    The pid of the running job.

       INDEX  Index of the job in the serial queue (i.e. it will be run when
              all the jobs of an inferior index have been run)

       R&Q    The job has this number instances of the given task which are
              either running or queued in the serial or lavg queue.

       OPTIONS
              List of main options which are set for the task.  L for the jobs
              which run only under a given system Load average (option lavg,
              lavg1, lavg5 and lavg15), LO (Load average Once) if only at most
              one instance of the task can be in the load average queue at a
              given time (option lavgonce), S for serialized jobs (option
              serial), SO for the jobs which will be serialized only for the
              next execution (Serial Once), and ES if several instances of the
              same job can run simultaneously (option exesev).

       LAVG   3 values, corresponding to the 1, 5, and 15-minute (in this
              order) system load average values below which the job will be
              run, otherwise it will be queued until the system load average
              is appropriate (see lavg option).

       UNTIL  Field corresponding to the until option.

       STRICT Field corresponding to the strict option. Y for yes, N for no.

       SCHEDULE
              Next run is scheduled at this time and date. Please note that
              fcrondyn prints the next execution time and date in the time
              zone of the system where fcron is running, and not the time zone
              which can be defined for using option timezone.

       CMD    The command that will be executed.

RETURN VALUES
       Fcrondyn returns 0 on normal exit and 1 on error.

CONFORMING TO
       Should be POSIX compliant.

FILES
       /usr/local/etc/fcron.conf
              Configuration file for fcron, fcrontab and fcrondyn: contains
              paths (spool dir, pid file) and default programs to use (editor,
              shell, etc). See fcron.conf(5) for more details.

       /usr/local/etc/fcron.allow
              Users allowed to use fcrontab and fcrondyn (one name per line,
              special name "all" acts for everyone)

       /usr/local/etc/fcron.deny
              Users who are not allowed to use fcrontab and fcrondyn (same
              format as allow file)

       /usr/local/etc/pam.d/fcron (or /usr/local/etc/pam.conf)
              PAM configuration file for fcron. Take a look at pam(8) for more
              details.

       If you're learning how to use fcron from scratch, I suggest that you
       read the HTML version of the documentation (if your are not reading it
       right now! :) ): the content is the same, but it is easier to navigate
       thanks to the hyperlinks.
