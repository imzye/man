NAME
       ae‐cvs‐ci - checkin a change set to CVS

SYNOPSIS
       ae‐cvs‐ci project‐name change‐number

DESCRIPTION
       The ae‐cvs‐ci command is used to check an Aegis change set into CVS.

       This script is a short wrapper around the ae‐repo‐ci(1) command.

       This is usually used in the integrate pass notify command project
       attribute, as in
              integrate_pass_notify_command =
                  "$bin/ae‐cvs‐ci $project $change";

EXIT STATUS
       The ae‐cvs‐ci command will exit with a status of 1 on any error.  The
       ae‐cvs‐ci command will only exit with a status of 0 if there are no
       errors.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       See aegis(1) for a list of environment variables which may affect this
       command.  See aepconf(5) for the project configuration file's
       project_specific field for how to set environment variables for all
       commands executed by Aegis.
