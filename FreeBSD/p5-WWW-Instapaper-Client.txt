NAME
       WWW::Instapaper::Client - An implementation of the Instapaper client
       API (see <http://www.instapaper.com/api>)

SYNOPSIS
               require WWW::Instapaper::Client;

               my $paper = WWW::Instapaper::Client->new(
                       username        => 'myname@mydomain.com', # E-mail OR username
                       password        => 'SooperSekrit',
               );

               my $result = $paper->add(
                       url   => 'http://some.domain/path/to/page.html',
                       title => "Page Title",  # optional, will try to get automatically if not given
                       selection => 'Some text on the page', #optional
               );

               if (defined $result) {
                       print "URL added: ", $result->[0], "\n";  # http://instapaper.com/go/######
                       print "Title: ", $result->[1], "\n";      # Title of page added
               }
               else {
                       # Must be an error
                       warn "Was error: " . $paper->error . "\n";
               }

DESCRIPTION
       This module is an implementation of the Instapaper API.

       "new"
                       my $paper = WWW::Instapaper::Client->new( %parameters );

               Returns a new instance of this class, configured with the
               appropriate parameters. Dies if invalid parameters are
               provided.

               Possible parameters are:

               user_agent
                       The user agent ("browser") the server will see.
                       Defaults to "WWW-Instapaper-Client/$VERSION".

               username
                       The Instapaper username. Often, but not always, an
                       e-mail address. Defaults to $ENV{instapaper_user}

               password
                       The password for the user's Instapaper account. The
                       user may not have a password, in which case, any value
                       works.  Defaults to $ENV{instapaper_pass}

               api_url The base URL for the Instapaper API. Defaults to
                       "https://www.instapaper.com/api". You shouldn't need to
                       change this unless you're connecting to a non-
                       Instapaper service that uses the same API.

               http_proxy, http_proxyuser, http_proxypass
                       The path to an HTTPS-capable proxy, and the username
                       and password as appropriate. The standard HTTP_PROXY
                       set of environment variables will work here; these are
                       widely documented.  You only need to specify these if
                       you have a proxy AND you don't have the environment
                       variables set.

       "add"
                       my $result = $paper->add(
                               url       =>  'http://path.to/page',  # required
                               title     =>  'Page title',           # optional
                               selection =>  'Text from page',       # optional
                       );

                       if (defined $result) {
                               print "URL added: ", $result->[0], "\n";  # http://instapaper.com/go/######
                               print "Title: ", $result->[1], "\n";      # Title of page added
                       }
                       else {
                               # Must be an error
                               warn "Was error: " . $paper->error . "\n";
                       }

               Adds the specified page URL to Instapaper. If a title is not
               provided, Instapaper will attempt to acquire the title by
               retrieving the page; that is, we set "auto-title = 1" for the
               Instapaper API when a title is not provided.

               You may optionally provide text that represents a selection
               from the page.

               If successful, "add" will return an ARRAYref containing the
               Instapaper "go" URL, and the page title as recorded by
               Instapaper.

               If an error is encountered, "add" returns undefined and the
               error message is available in "$paper-"error()>.

       "authenticate"
                       $paper->authenticate or warn "Could not authenticate: ".$paper->error."\n";

               Authenticates the user to Instapaper. This is useful to check
               that the credentials are valid before e.g. storing them for
               later use.

               If successful, "authenticate" will return a true value.

               If an error is encountered, "authenticate" returns undefined
               and the error message is available in "$paper-"error()>.

CHANGELOG
       Release 0.9_001
           Fixed dependency bug in Build.PL - forgot that Class::Base was
           required.
