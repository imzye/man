NAME
       Devel::Pointer - Fiddle around with pointers

SYNOPSIS
         use Devel::Pointer;
         $a = address_of($b);   # a = &b;
         $b = deref($a);        # b = *a;

         $a = unsmash_sv(0+$scalar_ref);
         @a = unsmash_av(0+$array_ref);
         %a = unsmash_hv(0+$hash_ref);
         &a = unsmash_cv(0+$code_ref);
         # OK, you can't do that, but you get the idea

         $c = deref(-1);        # *(-1), and the resulting segfault.

DESCRIPTION
       The primary purpose of this is to turn a smashed reference address back
       into a value. Once a reference is treated as a numeric value, you can't
       dereference it normally; although with this module, you can.

       Be careful, though, to avoid dereferencing things that don't want to be
       dereferenced.

   EXPORT
       All of the above
