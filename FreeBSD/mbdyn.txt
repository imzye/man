NAME
       mbdyn - MultiBody Dynamics analysis system.

SYNOPSIS
       femgen [-d ] [-o output-file] [-m {xyzc} ] [-h ] [output-file[...]]

DESCRIPTION
       femgen is a command-line utility provided with MBDyn, a multibody
       analysis tool released under GPL
       <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>.  In manipulates the binary
       output of NASTRAN and converts it into a database suitable for
       inclusion with the modal joint element.


OPTIONS
       -d     Skip output of initial modal displacement/velocities.

       -m {cxyz}
              When the argument is any of x, y, z, the corresponding value of
              NASTRAN's nodal mass matrix is used as the nodal mass for all
              nodes.  When the argument is c, all non-zero mass values must be
              identical; the non-zero value is used as the nodal mass for the
              corresponding node.

       -h, --help
              Displays usage information.

       -o <output-file>
              Name of file the database is written to (usually with .fem
              extension).  If not set, the command prompts for it.
