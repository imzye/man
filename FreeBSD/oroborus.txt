OROBORUS(1)             FreeBSD General Commands Manual            OROBORUS(1)

NAME
       oroborus - lightweight themeable window manager for X.

DESCRIPTION
       Oroborus is a small and simple window manager which does exactly what
       it says it does, manage windows. There is no fancy doc, clip, wharf, or
       a root menu for that matter. These utilities can be provided by other
       programs such as "deskmenu". Oroborus has support for Gnome and session
       management, or can be run as a stand-alone window manager.


FILES
       See oroborusrc(5) for details.
