XMTOOLBOX(1)            FreeBSD General Commands Manual           XMTOOLBOX(1)

NAME
       xmtoolbox - application launcher

SYNOPSIS
       xmtoolbox [-rcfile <file>] [-horizontal] [-hotkey [modifier[+...]]+key]

DESCRIPTION
       XmToolbox displays a user defined, multi-level menu of application
       groups and applications. It also interfaces with the xmsm(1) session
       manager to provide screen locking and session commands.

OPTIONS
       -rcfile <full path>
              Specify a configuration file to use. See CONFIGURATION for
              details.

       -title String
              Specify toolbox window title. Default is user's login name and
              the host name.

       -hotkey [Modifier ...] Key
              Hotkey to raise and focus the toolbox window.  See the resource
              description below.

       -horizontal
              Specifies whether the top-level menu should be laid out
              horizontally, rather than vertically.

CONFIGURATION
       XmToolbox reads its menu configuration from text files. If not
       specified on command line with the -rcfile option, its location
       defaults to .toolboxrc in user's home directory and toolboxrc in any of
       system configuration directories e.g. /etc/X11, /usr/lib/X11.

       A menu is defined by specifying the menu title followed by one or more
       menu item definitions enclosed in {...} brackets. Menu items are
       specified one per line, starting with the title string separated by the
       : character from the command† to be executed. A horizontal line may be
       added between menu items with the special identifier SEPARATOR. Any
       character in the title string may be prefixed with the ampersand
       character to specify a mnemonic. Comments may be entered following the
       # character at the beginning of a line. Sub-menus may be defined by
       placing them within the scope of the parent menu. Menu scope {}
       delimiters may only be placed at the beginning of an otherwise empty
       line.

       Literal & and : characters in title strings may be specified by
       prefixing them with the \ escape character. Literal whitespace
       characters in the command string may be specified either by escaping
       them with \, or enclosing the part of the string in quotation marks.

       The command string may contain sh(1) like ($... and ${...}) environment
       variables, which will be expanded accordingly. A literal $ may be
       specified with $$. Undefined variables are not treated as error, and
       expand to nothing, though a warning is printed to stderr.
