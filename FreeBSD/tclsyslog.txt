SYNOPSIS

       syslog ?options? priority message
______________________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
       This command sends message to system syslog facility with given
       priority. Valid priorities are:

       emerg, alert, crit, err, error, warning, notice, info, debug.


       By default, facility user is used and value of tcl variable argv0 is
       used as ident string.  However, any of the following options may be
       specified before priority to control these parameters:

       -facility value     Use specified facility instead of user. Following
                           facility are recognized:

                           authpriv, cron, daemon, kernel, lpr, mail, news,
                           syslog, user, uucp, local0, local1, local2.

       -ident string       Use given string instead of argv0 variable for
                           ident string.

       -options list       Set syslog options such as LOG_CONS, LOG_NDELAY
                           List should contain one or more strings CONS,
                           NDELAY, ODELAY, PERROR, PID, NOWAIT

                           Options NDELAY and ODELAY are effectively no-op,
                           becouse openlog(3) call is only performed upon
                           first message send.

                           Numeric value of options can be specified instead
                           of list for compatibility with older versions.
                           Mixing of numeric and string constants are not
                           allowed.

       If any options are specified, priority and message arguments can be
       omitted. In this case syslog command only sets logging parameters which
       would be used for subsequent calls.
