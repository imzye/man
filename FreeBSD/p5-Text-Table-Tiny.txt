NAME
       Text::Table::Tiny - generate simple text tables from 2D arrays

SYNOPSIS
        use Text::Table::Tiny 1.02 qw/ generate_table /;

        my $rows = [
          [qw/ Pokemon     Type     Count /],
          [qw/ Abra        Psychic      5 /],
          [qw/ Ekans       Poison     123 /],
          [qw/ Feraligatr  Water     5678 /],
        ];

        print generate_table(rows => $rows, header_row => 1), "\n";

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a single function, "generate_table", which formats
       a two-dimensional array of data as a text table.  It handles text that
       includes ANSI escape codes and wide Unicode characters.

       There are a number of options for adjusting the output format, but the
       intention is that the default option is good enough for most uses.

       The example shown in the SYNOPSIS generates the following table:

        +------------+---------+-------+
        | Pokemon    | Type    | Count |
        +------------+---------+-------+
        | Abra       | Psychic | 5     |
        | Ekans      | Poison  | 123   |
        | Feraligatr | Water   | 5678  |
        +------------+---------+-------+

       Support for wide characters was added in 1.02, so if you need that, you
       should specify that as your minimum required version, as per the
       SYNOPSIS.

       The interface changed with version 0.04, so if you use the
       generate_table() function illustrated above, then you need to require
       at least version 0.04 of this module.

       Some of the options described below were added in version 1.00, so your
       best bet is to require at least version 1.00.

   generate_table()
       The "generate_table" function understands a number of arguments, which
       are passed as a hash.  The only required argument is rows.  Where
       arguments were not supported in the original release, the first
       supporting version is noted.

       If you pass an unknown argument, "generate_table" will die with an
       error message.

       •   rows

           Takes an array reference which should contain one or more rows of
           data, where each row is an array reference.

       •   header_row

           If given a true value, the first row in the data will be
           interpreted as a header row, and separated from the rest of the
           table with a ruled line.

       •   header

           Takes an array reference which has the header row to use for the
           table.  You can't use this option together with "header_row".

           Added in 1.03

       •   separate_rows

           If given a true value, a separator line will be drawn between every
           row in the table, and a thicker line will be used for the header
           separator.

       •   top_and_tail

           If given a true value, then the top and bottom border lines will be
           skipped.  This reduces the vertical height of the generated table.

           Added in 0.04.

       •   align

           This takes an array ref with one entry per column, to specify the
           alignment of that column.  Legal values are 'l', 'c', and 'r'.  You
           can also specify a single alignment for all columns.  ANSI escape
           codes are handled.

           Added in 1.00.

       •   style

           Specifies the format of the output table.  The default is
           'classic', but other options are 'boxrule' and 'norule'.

           If you use the "boxrule" style, you'll probably need to run
           "binmode(STDOUT, ':utf8')".

           Added in 1.00.

       •   indent

           Specify an indent that should be prefixed to every line of the
           generated table.  This can either be a string of spaces, or an
           integer giving the number of spaces wanted.

           Added in 1.00.

       •   compact

           If set to a true value then we omit the single space padding on
           either side of every column.

           Added in 1.00.

   EXAMPLES
       If you just pass the data and no other options:

        generate_table(rows => $rows);

       You get minimal ruling:

        +------------+---------+-------+
        | Pokemon    | Type    | Count |
        | Abra       | Psychic | 5     |
        | Ekans      | Poison  | 123   |
        | Feraligatr | Water   | 5678  |
        +------------+---------+-------+

       If you want a separate header, set the header_row option to a true
       value, as shown in the SYNOPSIS.

       To take up fewer lines, you can miss out the top and bottom rules, by
       setting "top_and_tail" to a true value:

        generate_table(rows => $rows, header_row => 1, top_and_tail => 1);

       This will generate the following:

        | Pokemon    | Type    | Count |
        +------------+---------+-------+
        | Abra       | Psychic | 5     |
        | Ekans      | Poison  | 123   |
        | Feraligatr | Water   | 5678  |

       If you want a more stylish looking table, set the "style" parameter to
       'boxrule':

        binmode(STDOUT,':utf8');
        generate_table(rows => $rows, header_row => 1, style => 'boxrule');

       This uses the ANSI box rule characters.  Note that you will need to
       ensure UTF output.

        ┌────────────┬─────────┬───────┐
        │ Pokemon    │ Type    │ Count │
        ├────────────┼─────────┼───────┤
        │ Abra       │ Psychic │ 5     │
        │ Ekans      │ Poison  │ 123   │
        │ Feraligatr │ Water   │ 5678  │
        └────────────┴─────────┴───────┘

       You might want to right-align numeric values:

        generate_table( ... , align => [qw/ l l r /] );

       The "align" parameter can either take an arrayref, or a string with an
       alignment to apply to all columns:

        ┌────────────┬─────────┬───────┐
        │ Pokemon    │ Type    │ Count │
        ├────────────┼─────────┼───────┤
        │ Abra       │ Psychic │     5 │
        │ Ekans      │ Poison  │   123 │
        │ Feraligatr │ Water   │  5678 │
        └────────────┴─────────┴───────┘

       If you're using the boxrule style, you might feel you can remove the
       padding on either side of every column, done by setting "compact" to a
       true value:

        ┌──────────┬───────┬─────┐
        │Pokemon   │Type   │Count│
        ├──────────┼───────┼─────┤
        │Abra      │Psychic│    5│
        │Ekans     │Poison │  123│
        │Feraligatr│Water  │ 5678│
        └──────────┴───────┴─────┘

       You can also ask for a rule between each row, in which case the header
       rule becomes stronger.  This works best when combined with the boxrule
       style:

        generate_table( ... , separate_rows => 1 );

       Which results in the following:

        ┌────────────┬─────────┬───────┐
        │ Pokemon    │ Type    │ Count │
        ╞════════════╪═════════╪═══════╡
        │ Abra       │ Psychic │     5 │
        ├────────────┼─────────┼───────┤
        │ Ekans      │ Poison  │   123 │
        ├────────────┼─────────┼───────┤
        │ Feraligatr │ Water   │  5678 │
        └────────────┴─────────┴───────┘

       You can use this with the other styles, but I'm not sure you'd want to.

       If you just want columnar output, use the "norule" style:

        generate_table( ... , style => 'norule' );

       which results in:

         Pokemon      Type      Count

         Abra         Psychic       5
         Ekans        Poison      123
         Feraligatr   Water      5678

       Note that everywhere you saw a line on the previous tables, there will
       be a space character in this version.  So you may want to combine the
       "top_and_tail" option, to suppress the extra blank lines before and
       after the body of the table.
