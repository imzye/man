NAME
       checkdigits - check or generate check digits

VERSION
       This document describes checkdigits v1.3.3

SYNOPSIS
         checkdigits [Options] command [[number] ...]

         options:

          -algorithm alg - use this algorithm

         commands:

          check           - check validity of number containing checkdigit
          checkdigit      - return checkdigit belonging to number
          complete        - return number completed with checkdigit
          list_algorithms - list all known algorithms
          describe        - describe the given algorithms

DESCRIPTION
       This is a command line program that may be used to compute any
       checkdigit known by the perl module Algorithm::CheckDigits.

OPTIONS AND COMMANDS
   Options
       -algorithm alg

       Compute checkdigits according to algorithm alg. Instead of providing
       the algorithm with this option, you may choose to rename the program to
       the name of the algorithm or to "checkdigits-" followed by the name of
       the algorithm.

       You must provide the algorithm with any of these means or the program
       will not compute any checkdigit.

   Commands
       check

       checkdigit

       complete

       When called with this command, the program will take the number compute
       the appropriate checkdigits and return the complete number with
       checkdigits.

       describe

       Called with this command, the program will list the algorithm handles
       given on the command line with a short description or the word
       "unknown" for any unknown algorithm. See command list_algorithms for a
       list of known algorithms.

       list_algorithms

       Called with this command, the program will list all known algorithms
       together with a short description and then exit.

DIAGNOSTICS
CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
       At the moment the program doesn't recognise any environment variables.

       The algorithm to use may be predefined by renaming the program to the
       name of the algorithm or to "checkdigits-" followed by the name of the
       algorithm.
