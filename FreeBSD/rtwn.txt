RTWN(4)                FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                RTWN(4)

NAME
     rtwn – Realtek IEEE 802.11 wireless network driver

SYNOPSIS
     options RTWN_DEBUG
     options RTWN_WITHOUT_UCODE

     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device rtwn
           device rtwnfw
           device rtwn_usb
           device rtwn_pci
           device wlan
           device firmware

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place
     following lines in loader.conf(5):

           if_rtwn_pci_load="YES"
           if_rtwn_usb_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The rtwn driver provides support for wireless network devices based on
     the Realtek RTL8192C, RTL8188E, RTL8192E, RTL8812A and RTL8821A
     programming APIs.  These APIs are used by a wide variety of chips; most
     chips with USB and some with PCI interface are supported.

     To enable use for PCI/PCIe systems, see the rtwn_pci(4) driver; for USB
     devices, use the rtwn_usb(4) driver.

     The driver supports station, adhoc, hostap and monitor mode operation.
     There are no limitations for number of monitor mode virtual interfaces;
     in addition to any other virtual interface one station interface can be
     added (Note: RTL8821AU supports two non-monitor mode interfaces at the
     same time).

     All chips have hardware support for WEP, AES-CCM and TKIP encryption.

     The rtwn driver can be configured at runtime with ifconfig(8).

FILES

     The driver (if not compiled with options RTWN_WITHOUT_UCODE ) may use
     following firmware files, which are loaded when an interface is brought
     up:
           /boot/kernel/rtwn-rtl8188eefw.ko
           /boot/kernel/rtwn-rtl8188eufw.ko
           /boot/kernel/rtwn-rtl8192cfwE_B.ko
           /boot/kernel/rtwn-rtl8192cfwE.ko
           /boot/kernel/rtwn-rtl8192cfwT.ko
           /boot/kernel/rtwn-rtl8192cfwU.ko
           /boot/kernel/rtwn-rtl8192eufw.ko
           /boot/kernel/rtwn-rtl8812aufw.ko
           /boot/kernel/rtwn-rtl8821aufw.ko

EXAMPLES
     Join an existing BSS network (i.e., connect to an access point):

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev rtwn0 inet 192.168.0.20 \
               netmask 0xffffff00

     Join a specific BSS network with network name “my_net”:

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev rtwn0 ssid my_net up

     Join a specific BSS network with 64-bit WEP encryption:

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev rtwn0 ssid my_net \
                   wepmode on wepkey 0x1234567890 weptxkey 1 up

     Create an IBSS network with 128-bit WEP encryption on the channel 4:

           ifconfig wlan create wlandev rtwn0 wlanmode adhoc ssid my_net \
                   wepmode on wepkey 0x01020304050607080910111213 weptxkey 1 \
                   channel 4

     Join/create an 802.11b IBSS network with network name “my_net”:

           ifconfig wlan0 create wlandev rtwn0 wlanmode adhoc
           ifconfig wlan0 inet 192.168.0.22 netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_net \
                   mode 11b

     Create a host-based access point:

           ifconfig wlan0 create wlandev rtwn0 wlanmode hostap
           ifconfig wlan0 inet 192.168.0.10 netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_ap

LOADER TUNABLES
     Tunables can be set at the loader(8) prompt before booting the kernel or
     stored in loader.conf(5).

     dev.rtwn.%d.hwcrypto
             This tunable controls how key slots are assigned:
             0 - disable h/w crypto support.  Features that require access to
             frame contents (e.g., TCP/UDP/IP Rx checksum validation) will not
             work;
             1 - use h/w crypto support for pairwise keys only;
             2 - use h/w crypto support for all keys; may not work for multi-
             vap configurations.
             By default it is set to 1.

     dev.rtwn.%d.ratectl
             This tunable switches between rate control implementations:
             0 - no rate control;
             1 - driver sends 'tx complete' reports to net80211; algorithm is
             controlled via net80211;
             2 - firmware-based rate control.
             By default it is set to 1; however driver may choose another
             algorithm in case if it is not implemented
             Currently selected algorithm is reported via
             dev.rtwn.%d.ratectl_selected read-only OID.

     dev.rtwn.%d.rx_buf_size
             (USB only) Controls size of temporary Rx buffer; smaller buffer
             size may increase number of interrupts.

DIAGNOSTICS
     rtwn%d: could not read efuse byte at address 0x%x
     rtwn%d: %s: cannot read rom, error %d  There was an error while reading
     ROM; device attach will be aborted.  This should not happen.

     rtwn%d: failed loadfirmware of file %s  For some reason, the driver was
     unable to read the microcode file from the filesystem.  The file might be
     missing or corrupted.  The driver will disable firmware-dependent
     features.

     rtwn%d: wrong firmware size (%zu)
     rtwn%d: %s: failed to upload firmware %s (error %d)
     rtwn%d: timeout waiting for firmware readiness  Firmware upload failed;
     the file might be corrupted.  The driver will disable firmware-dependent
     features.  This should not happen.

     rtwn%d: device timeout  A frame dispatched to the hardware for
     transmission did not complete in time.  The driver will reset the
     hardware.  This should not happen.

     driver first appeared in OpenBSD 5.8.

AUTHORS
     The rtwn driver was initially written by Stefan Sperling
     <stsp@openbsd.org> and ported by Kevin Lo <kevlo@freebsd.org>.  It was
     based on the urtwn driver written by Damien Bergamini
     <damien.bergamini@free.fr>.

BUGS
     The rtwn driver currently does not implement firmware-based rate control.
