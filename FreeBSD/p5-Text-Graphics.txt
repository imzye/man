NAME
       Text::Graphics -- A text graphics rendering toolkit

DESCRIPTION
       This is a toolkit for rendering plain text via an API like that used
       for graphics rendering in GUI toolkits.  This package might be used
       when you want to do sophisticated rendering of plain text, e.g., for
       graphing, creating of complex forms for email and fax, and so on.

SYNOPSIS
        use Text::Graphics;
        my $text = "A text graphics rendering toolkit.\n";
        my $page = Text::Graphics::Page->new( 20, 10);
        my $panel0 = Text::Graphics::BorderedPanel->new( 20, 10);
        my $panel1 =
         Text::Graphics::FilledBorderedTextPanel->new($text x 3, 25, 12);
        $panel0->setBackground("#");
        $panel1->setBackground(" ");
        $page->add($panel0);
        $page->add($panel1, 5, 2);
        $page->render();

User API
   "Text::Graphics::Page"
       Class to represent a page.

       "new (width, height)"
           Construct a new page with the specified width and height.

       "add (Panel, x_offset, y_offset)"
           Add a Panel at the specified offset.

       "render ( [ scalar_reference ] )"
           Render the page.  If an argument is given, it is assumed to be a
           SCALAR REFERENCE, and rendering will be done to such reference.
           e.g., if you want to render to $buf, you might do

            $w->render(\ $buf);

           If no argument to render() is provided, then rendering is simply
           done to STDOUT using "print".

   "Text::Graphics::Panel"
       Class to represent a panel.

       "new (width, height)"
           Construct a new panel with the specified width and height.

       "add (Panel, x_offset, y_offset)"
           Add a Panel at the specified offset.  This child panel is contained
           within its parent and will not extend beyond the parents
           boundaries.

       "setBackground ( background )"
           Set the background on the panel to the specified char.

       "getSize ()"
           Get the size of a panel.  This method is a hook for layout
           managers.  E.g., If you set up a wrapped text panel with height 0,
           then call getSize(), then it will return the same width but the new
           "desired" height.  (If you are interested in how to write a layout
           manager on top of this code, please contact me (SF) as I have done
           so but have not released it.)

       "setSize (width, height)"
           Set the size of a panel.  This method is a hook for layout
           managers.

       "getOffset ()"
           get the offset of a panel.  This method is a hook for layout
           managers.

       "setOffset (x_offset, y_offset)"
           set the offset of a panel.  This method is a hook for layout
           managers.

Subclassing
       Most of the work you might do with this module will be by subclassing
       panel.  The idea is you make a new panel, like LinePanel, that has a
       constructor setting character to draw and the start and end coordinates
       for the line.  Then, in the LinePanels _drawSelf(gc) routine, it calls
       on the gc to draw a line:

        package LinePanel;
        use vars qw (@ISA);
        @ISA = qw (Panel);

        sub new {
         my $this = {};
         bless $this, shift;
         $this->{char} = shift;
         $this->{startx} = shift;
         $this->{starty} = shift;
         $this->{endx} = shift;
         $this->{endy} = shift;
         return $this;
        }

        sub _drawSelf {
         my $this = shift;
         my $gc = shift;

         $gc->drawLine($this->{char},
                       $this->{startx}, $this->{starty},
                       $this->{endx}, $this->{endy});

        }

       There are some other subclasses included, particularly those for text
       handling.

       Actually the drawLine() method for the GraphicsContext is not included
       b/c I just do not need it, though I have a mostly working version if
       anyone is interested (it is not complicated =).

       GraphicsContext does include the following methods, however:

       "drawBorder(x_offset, y_offset, width, height)"
           Draw a border with the specified coordinates.

       "fillRect(char, x_offset, y_offset, width, height)"
           Fill the specified rectangle with the specified character.  Note
           that filling with " " is a good way to get an "opaque" panel.

       "drawString(string, x_offset, y_offset)"
           Draw the specified string at the specified offset.  If you want to
           control the width then you probably want to look at
           FilledTextPanel.
