GSS_INQUIRE_MECHS_FOR_NAME(3)           FreeBSD Library Functions Manual (prm)

NAME
     gss_inquire_mechs_for_name – List mechanisms that support the specified
     name-type

SYNOPSIS
     #include <gssapi/gssapi.h>

     OM_uint32
     gss_inquire_mechs_for_name(OM_uint32 *minor_status,
         const gss_name_t input_name, gss_OID_set *mech_types);

DESCRIPTION
     Returns the set of mechanisms supported by the GSS-API implementation
     that may be able to process the specified name.

     Each mechanism returned will recognize at least one element within the
     name.  It is permissible for this routine to be implemented within a
     mechanism-independent GSS-API layer, using the type information contained
     within the presented name, and based on registration information provided
     by individual mechanism implementations.  This means that the returned
     mech_types set may indicate that a particular mechanism will understand
     the name when in fact it would refuse to accept the name as input to
     gss_canonicalize_name(), gss_init_sec_context(), gss_acquire_cred() or
     gss_add_cred() (due to some property of the specific name, as opposed to
     the name type).  Thus this routine should be used only as a pre-filter
     for a call to a subsequent mechanism-specific routine.

PARAMETERS
     minor_status      Mechanism specific status code.

     input_name        The name to which the inquiry relates.

     mech_types        Set of mechanisms that may support the specified name.
                       The returned OID set must be freed by the caller after
                       use with a call to gss_release_oid_set().

RETURN VALUES
     GSS_S_COMPLETE      Successful completion

     GSS_S_BAD_NAME      The input_name parameter was ill-formed
