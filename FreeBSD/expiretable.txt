EXPIRETABLE(1)          FreeBSD General Commands Manual         EXPIRETABLE(1)

NAME
     expiretable – removes PF table entries based on age

SYNOPSIS
     expiretable [-dnvp] [-a anchor] [-t age] table

DESCRIPTION
     expiretable is used to remove entries from the pf table specified by
     table with an age greater than that specified by -t age.  The age in
     question being the amount of time that has passed since the statistics
     for the respective entry in the target table was last cleared.

     The options:

     -a anchor
             Specify the anchor containing the (private) table.

     -d      Daemonize. Detach from terminal and run in the background. The -p
             flag is implied.

     -n      Dry-run. Go through the motions, but don't actually delete
             anything.

     -p      Will cause expiretable to poll for expired entries instead of
             exiting.

     -t age  Specify the maximum age of a table-entry.  age can be specified
             as a positive integer, in seconds, or as a series of positive
             integers with suffixes. Valid suffixes are d (days), h (hours), m
             (minutes), s (seconds). The total number of seconds must be less
             than 100 million.

     -v      Verbose output. Use twice for even more verbose output.

EXAMPLES
     The following removes any entries in table int.users older than one hour:

           # expiretable -v -t 3600 int.users

     This example removes any entries in table int.users older than one and a
     half hour:

           # expiretable -v -t 1h30m int.users
