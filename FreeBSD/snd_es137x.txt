SND_ES137X(4)          FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual          SND_ES137X(4)

NAME
     snd_es137x – Ensoniq AudioPCI ES137x bridge device driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device sound
           device snd_es137x

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           snd_es137x_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The snd_es137x bridge driver allows the generic audio driver sound(4) to
     attach to the Ensoniq 137x audio cards.

   Runtime Configuration
     The following sysctl(8) variables are available in addition to those
     available to all sound(4) devices:

           hw.snd.pcm%d.latency_timer      Controls the PCI latency timer
                                           setting.  Increasing this value
                                           will solve most popping and
                                           crackling issues (especially on VIA
                                           motherboards).

           hw.snd.pcm%d.spdif_enabled      Enables S/PDIF output on the
                                           primary playback channel.  This
                                           sysctl(8) variable is available
                                           only if the device is known to
                                           support S/PDIF output.

           dev.pcm.%d.polling              Experimental polling mode, where
                                           the driver operates by querying the
                                           device state on each tick using
                                           callout(9).  Polling is disabled by
                                           default.  Do not enable it unless
                                           you are facing weird interrupt
                                           problems or if the device cannot
                                           generate interrupts at all.
