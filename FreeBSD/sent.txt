NAME
     sent – simple plaintext presentation tool

SYNOPSIS
     sent [-v] [file]

DESCRIPTION
     sent is a simple plain text presentation tool for X. sent does not need
     LaTeX, LibreOffice or any other fancy file format. Instead, sent reads
     plain text describing the slides. sent can also draw images.

     Every paragraph represents a slide in the presentation. Especially for
     presentations using the Takahashi method this is very nice and allows you
     to write the presentation for a quick lightning talk within a few
     minutes.

OPTIONS
     -v      Print version information to stdout and exit.

USAGE
     Mouse commands

             Button1 | Button5
                     Go to next slide, if existent.

             Button3 | Button4
                     Go to previous slide, if existent.

     Keyboard commands

             Escape | q
                     Quit.

             r       Reload the slides. Only works on file input.

             Right | Return | Space | l | j | Down | Next | n
                     Go to next slide, if existent.

             Left | Backspace | h | k | Up | Prior | p
                     Go to previous slide, if existent.

FORMAT
     The presentation file is made up of at least one paragraph, with an empty
     line separating two slides.  Each input line is interpreted literally,
     except from control characters at the beginning of lines described as
     follows:

     @       Create individual slide containing the image pointed to by the
             filename following the @.

     #       Ignore this input line.

     \       Create input line using the characters following the \ without
             interpreting them.

CUSTOMIZATION
     sent can be customized by creating a custom config.h and (re)compiling
     the source code. This keeps it fast, secure and simple.
