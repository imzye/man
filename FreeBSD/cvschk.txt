CVSCHK(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              CVSCHK(1)

NAME
     cvschk – Quick offline CVS status checker

SYNOPSIS
     cvschk [-adhlrtV] [--all] [--debug] [--help] [--local] [--restrict]
            [--tabular] [--version]

DESCRIPTION
     The cvschk utility is a perl program which checks the status of the CVS
     controlled files and gives an ASCII table sorted after the status of
     files. It works offline, without access to the CVS repository.

     The options are:

     -a, --all
             Show all statistics, including the names of files that are up to
             date, used tags, ignored patterns and more.

     -d, --debug
             Show debug information.

     -h, --help
             Print a short usage help.

     -l, --local
             Do not descend into sub-directories.

     -r, --restrict
             Do not show the names of unknown files (useful in directories
             with lots of temporary files).

     -t, --tabular
             Show one file per line, preceded with a status word, sorted by
             filename.

     -V, --version
             Print the version and exit.
