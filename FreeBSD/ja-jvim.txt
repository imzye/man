NAME
       vim - Vi IMproved, a programmers text editor

SYNOPSIS
       vim [options] [file ..]
       vim [options] -t tag
       vim [options] -e [errorfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Vim is a text editor that is upwards compatible to vi. It can be used
       to edit any ASCII text. It is especially useful for editing programs.

       There are a lot of enhancements above vi: multi level undo, multi
       windows and buffers, command line editing, filename completion, on-line
       help, visual selection, etc..  Read difference.doc for a summary of the
       differences between vi and Vim.

       Most often Vim is started to edit a single file with the command

            vim file

       More generally VIM is started with:

            vim [options] [filelist]

       If the filelist is missing, the editor will start with an empty buffer.
       Otherwise exactly one out of the following three may be used to choose
       one or more files to be edited.

       file ..     A list of file names. The first one (alphabetically) will
                   be the current file and read into the buffer. The cursor
                   will be positioned on the first line of the buffer. You can
                   get to the other files with the ":next" command.

       -t {tag}    The file to edit and the initial cursor position depends on
                   a "tag", a sort of goto label. {tag} is looked up in the
                   tags file, the associated file becomes the current file and
                   the associated command is executed. Mostly this is used for
                   C programs. {tag} then should be a function name. The
                   effect is that the file containing that function becomes
                   the current file and the cursor is positioned on the start
                   of the function (see reference.doc, section "tag
                   searches").

       -e [errorfile]
                   Start in quickFix mode. The file [errorfile] is read and
                   the first error is displayed. If [errorfile] is omitted the
                   file name is obtained from the 'errorfile' option (defaults
                   to "AztecC.Err" for the Amiga, "errors" on other systems).
                   Further errors can be jumped to with the ":cn" command. See
                   reference.doc section 5.5.

OPTIONS
       The options, if present, must precede the filelist. The options may be
       given in any order.

       -r          Recovery mode. The swap file is used to recover a crashed
                   editing session. The swap file is a file with the same file
                   name as the text file with ".swp" appended. See
                   reference.doc, chapter "Recovery after a crash".

       -v          View mode. The 'readonly' option will be set. You can still
                   edit the buffer, but will be prevented from accidently
                   overwriting a file. If you do want to overwrite a file, add
                   an exclamation mark to the Ex command, as in ":w!".  The -v
                   option also implies the -n option (see below).  The
                   'readonly' option can be reset with ":set noro" (see
                   reference.doc, options chapter).

       -b          Binary. A few options will be set that makes it possible to
                   edit a binary or executable file.

       +[num]      For the first file the cursor will be positioned on line
                   "num". If "num" is missing, the cursor will be positioned
                   on the last line.

       +/pat       For the first file the cursor will be positioned on the
                   first occurrence of "pat" (see reference.doc, section
                   "pattern searches" for the available search patterns).

       +{command}

       -c {command}
                   {command} will be executed after the first file has been
                   read. {command} is interpreted as an Ex command. If the
                   {command} contains spaces it must be enclosed in double
                   quotes (this depends on the shell that is used).  Example:
                   Vim "+set si" main.c

       -x          (Amiga only) Vim is not restarted to open a new window.
                   This option should be used when Vim is executed by a
                   program that will wait for the edit session to finish (e.g.
                   mail). The ":sh" and ":!" commands will not work.

       -o[N]       Open N windows. When N is omitted, open one window for each
                   file.

       -n          No swap file will be used. Recovery after a crash will be
                   impossible. Handy if you want to edit a file on a very slow
                   medium (e.g. floppy). Can also be done with ":set uc=0".
                   Can be undone with ":set uc=200".

       -s {scriptin}
                   The script file {scriptin} is read. The characters in the
                   file are interpreted as if you had typed them. The same can
                   be done with the command ":source! {scriptin}". If the end
                   of the file is reached before the editor exits, further
                   characters are read from the keyboard.

       -w {scriptout}
                   All the characters that you type are recorded in the file
                   {scriptout}, until you exit VIM. This is useful if you want
                   to create a script file to be used with "vim -s" or
                   ":source!".

       -T terminal Tells Vim the name of the terminal you are using. Should be
                   a terminal known to Vim (builtin) or defined in the termcap
                   file.

       -d device   Open "device" for use as a terminal. Only on the Amiga.
                   Example: "-d con:20/30/600/150".
