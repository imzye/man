RDMA_POST_UD_SEND(3)     Librdmacm Programmer's Manual    RDMA_POST_UD_SEND(3)



NAME
       rdma_post_ud_send - post a work request to send a datagram.

SYNOPSIS
       #include <rdma/rdma_verbs.h>

       int rdma_post_ud_send (struct rdma_cm_id *id, void *context, void
       *addr, size_t length, struct ibv_mr *mr, int flags, struct ibv_ah *ah,
       uint32_t remote_qpn);

ARGUMENTS
       id          A reference to a communication identifier where the message
                   buffer will be posted.

       context     User-defined context associated with the request.

       addr        The address of the memory buffer to post.

       length      The length of the memory buffer.

       mr          Optional registered memory region associated with the
                   posted buffer.

       flags       Optional flags used to control the send operation.

       ah          An address handle describing the address of the remote
                   node.

       remote_qpn  The number of the destination queue pair.

DESCRIPTION
       Posts a work request to the send queue of the queue pair associated
       with the rdma_cm_id.  The contents of the posted buffer will be sent to
       the specified destination queue pair.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error.  If an error occurs, errno will
       be set to indicate the failure reason.

NOTES
       The user is responsible for ensuring that the destination queue pair
       has queued a receive request before issuing the send operations.  For a
       list of supported flags, see ibv_post_send.  Unless the send request is
       using inline data, the message buffer must have been registered before
       being posted, with the mr parameter referencing the registration.  The
       buffer must remain registered until the send completes.

       The user-defined context associated with the send request will be
       returned to the user through the work completion wr_id, work request
       identifier, field.
