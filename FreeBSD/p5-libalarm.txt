NAME
       Alarm::_TieSIG - Module handling tying of %SIG for alarm extensions.

DESCRIPTION
       This is an internal utility module for use with the Alarm::* alarm
       extensions, that handles tying of the Perl built-in variable %SIG.
       This is deep magic and you use this module at your own risk.

       To use this class, simply "use" it and then call the
       Alarm::_TieSIG::tiesig() function.  This replaces %SIG with a dummy
       tied hash.

       Whenever the new %SIG is accessed, this class checks to see if the
       requested key is ALRM.  If so, it calls sethandler() for STORE's, and
       gethandler() for FETCHes.  You must provide both of these methods in
       your package.

       All other operations are passed on to the original, magic %SIG.

       Note: Do not call tiesig() more than once.  Doing so produces a warning
       and no other effects.

EXAMPLE
       The following code will disable, with warnings, attempts to set SIGALRM
       handlers in your program (although it's not impossible to get past if
       someone really wanted to):

         use Alarm::_TieSIG;
         Alarm::_TieSIG::tiesig();

         sub sethandler {
           warn "\$SIG{ALRM} has been disabled.\n";
         }

         sub gethandler {
           warn "\$SIG{ALRM} has been disabled.\n";
         }

DISCLAIMER
       This module is not guaranteed to work.  In fact, it will probably break
       at the most inconvient time.  If this module breaks your program,
       destroys your computer, ruins your life, or otherwise makes you
       unhappy, do not complain (especially not to me).  It's your own fault.
