DESCRIPTION
     FreedroidRPG tells the story of a world destroyed by a conflict between
     robots and their human masters.  Play as Tux in a quest to save the world
     from the murderous rebel bots who know no mercy.  You get to choose which
     path you wish to follow, and freedom of choice is everywhere in the game.

     FreedroidRPG features a real time combat system with melee and ranged
     weapons, fairly similar to the proprietary game Diablo.  There is an
     innovative system of programs that can be run in order to take control of
     enemy robots, alter their behavior, or improve one's characteristics.
     You can use over 150 different kinds of items and fight countless enemies
     on your way to your destiny.  An advanced dialog system provides story
     background and immersive role playing situations.

   Gameplay
     Please see the README or the tutorial in the game for more details.
