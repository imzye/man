GSS_RELEASE_BUFFER(3)                   FreeBSD Library Functions Manual (prm)

NAME
     gss_release_buffer – Discard a buffer

SYNOPSIS
     #include <gssapi/gssapi.h>

     OM_uint32
     gss_release_buffer(OM_uint32 *minor_status, gss_buffer_t buffer);

DESCRIPTION
     Free storage associated with a buffer.  The storage must have been
     allocated by a GSS-API routine.  In addition to freeing the associated
     storage, the routine will zero the length field in the descriptor to
     which the buffer parameter refers, and implementations are encouraged to
     additionally set the pointer field in the descriptor to NULL.  Any buffer
     object returned by a GSS-API routine may be passed to
     gss_release_buffer() (even if there is no storage associated with the
     buffer).

PARAMETERS
     minor_status      Mechanism specific status code.

     buffer            The storage associated with the buffer will be deleted.
                       The gss_buffer_desc object will not be freed, but its
                       length field will be zeroed.

RETURN VALUES
     GSS_S_COMPLETE      Successful completion
