NAME
       rcpd - remote file copy daemon

SYNOPSIS
       rcpd [ -a -n ]

DESCRIPTION
       The Rcpd exists to copy files between machines. It listens for service
       requests at the port indicated by the shell services specification; see
       services(5).

       Rcpd offers up files from the /tftpboot directory (or another build-
       time configured directory), optionally prepending the source IP address
       (followed by a /) to the filename specified (again, optionally
       configured at build-time. The default is not to do this).

       Rcpd tries to offer the same security model as tftpd by only writing to
       files that exist and are writable by user nobody and only reading from
       files that are readably by user nobody.

       If the -a option is specified, hostnames are reverse-resolved and
       connections are aborted if addresses and names are not consistent.

       Transport-level keepalive messages are enabled unless the -n option is
       present. This is probably entirely irrelevent for rcpd.

HISTORY
       The rcp utility appeared in 4.2BSD. The rcpd utility is based on the
       4.4BSD (Lite) versions of rcp and rshd.  rcpd was written by John
       Hawkinson; the idea for this came from a discussion with Bill Fenner.

BUGS
       Prevents you from running an rshd.

       Doesn't have very elaborate negotiation, but it's a damn sight better
       than tftp.
