NAME
       Markapl - Markup as Perl

VERSION
       This document describes Markapl version 0.08

SYNOPSIS
           package MyView;
           use Markapl;

           template '/a/page.html' => sub {
               h1("#title") { "Hi" };
               p(".first") { "In the begining, lorem ipsum...." };
               p(style => "color: red;") { "But...." };
           }

           package main;
           my $output = MyView->render("/a/page.html");

TUTORIAL
       Here's a short guide how to use this module. You can skip this tutorial
       section if you're already using Template::Declare, since it's exactly
       the same.

       First of all, you need a sole package for defining your templates,
       let's call it "MyView" in the example.  Then you "use Markapl" (but not
       use base), which installs many helper subroutines into your "MyView"
       package for declaring and rendering templates:

           package MyView;
           use Markapl;

       To define a template, use "template" function like this:

           template '/page.html' => sub {
               h1("#title") { "Hi" };
               p(".first") { "In the begining, lorem ipsum...." };
               p(style => "color: red;") { "But...." };
           }

       To render it, call "render" function:

           my $out = MyView->render("/page.html");

       Besides these two functions, "Markapl" also exports about another 120
       tag functions that are named after HTML tags, for exapmle, h1, h2, h3,
       div, p, and span. Almost all HTML tags are defined as a function.

       In your template, if you say:

           h1 { "Hi" };

       It'll be rendered as:

           <h1>Hi</h1>

       The block after "h1" is an anonymous sub-routine, and the return value
       of which will become the content of the "h1" tag.

       If you want to add attributes to the tag, do it like this:

           div(id => "example", class => "lipsum") { "Lorem ipsum" };

       Alternatively, you can use CSS selector syntax to quickly defined id
       and class attribute:

           div("#example") { "Lorem ipsum" };

       That only works when the attribute list contain exactly one string
       inside.

       A special function "outs" need to be used to concatenate strings with
       inline elements:

           p {
               outs "Hello, ";
               a(href => "/users/gugod") { "gugod" };
           }

DESCRIPTION
       This is a new try to use Devel::Declare to change the Perl5 language.
       It learns pretty much everything from Template::Declare, and has
       similar interface. With only one difference: how element attributes are
       defined.

       In Template::Declare, it goes like:

           h1 {
               id is "title";
               outs "Hi";
           };

       In here, it is:

           h1(id => "title") { "Hi" };

       Or a shorthand for "id" attribute:

           h1("#title") { "Hi" };

       However, there are conflict between HTML tag names and perl builtin
       function / ops, and the behaviour of which cannot (and better not) be
       altered by Markapl:

           link map q s sub tr

       To generate markup with these tags, and "html_" prefix to them, for
       instance:

           html_q { "I a quotation, but this tag is not supported by IE." }

       It'll produce:

           <q>I a quotation, but this tag is not supported by IE.</q>

       For tables, since there's absolutely no way to clobber "tr" in Perl
       AFAIK (not without using source filter,) tr and td are both renamed to
       row and cell, correspondly:

           table {
             row {
               cell { "gugod" };
               cell { "170cm" };
               cell { "100kg" };
             }
           }

       It actually makes more sense. This idea is borrowed from
       Template::Declare

       Several helper methods are defined in Markapl::Helpers. Read the
       documentation there too.

       Smoe HTML5 tags allow value-less attributes like:

           <script async src="foo.js"></script>

       To generate those, pass <undef> as the attribute value:

           script(src => "foo.js", async => undef);

INTERFACE
       template($name, $code);
           Defines a template.

       render($name)
           You need to call it as class method like,

              MyView->render("/foo.html");

           Or

              render MyView, "/foo.html";

           If you happen to like this style.

           Doesn't support template variables yet. Stay tuned.

       outs($str);
           Should only be used inside a template body. It appends $str to
           current output buffer frame.

       set($name, $value)
           Store a value under given name in your view package stash. Should
           be used as a class method like:

               MyView->set(title => "Greeting");

           Think of it is assigning values to global template variables. $name
           must be a string and $value can be any scalar. It could be a
           reference to other structured data.

       get($name)
           Retriving a named value from the view package stash. This should
           only be used in template as a function call, like:

               template 'index.html' => sub {
                   h1 { get("title") }
               }

           If you call it as a class method, it will still work:

               MyView->get("title")
