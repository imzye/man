NAME
       Geo::Gpx - Create and parse GPX files

SYNOPSIS
           my ($gpx, $waypoints, $tracks);

           # From a filename, an open file, or an XML string:

           $gpx = Geo::Gpx->new( input => $fname );
           $gpx = Geo::Gpx->new( input => $fh    );
           $gpx = Geo::Gpx->new(   xml => $xml   );

           my $waypoints = $gpx->waypoints();
           my $tracks    = $gpx->tracks();

DESCRIPTION
       "Geo::Gpx" supports the parsing and generation of GPX data.

   Constructor
       new( input => ($fname | $fh) or xml => $xml [, work_dir =>
       $working_directory ] )
           Create and return a new "Geo::Gpx" instance based on a *.gpx file
           ($fname), an open filehandle ($fh), or an XML string ($xml). GPX
           1.0 and 1.1 are supported.

           The optional "work_dir" (or "wd" for short) specifies where to save
           any working files, such as with the save() method. It can be
           supplied as a relative path or as an absolute path. If "work_dir"
           is omitted, it is set based on the path of the $fname supplied or
           the current working directory if the constructor is called with an
           XML string or a filehandle (see set_wd() for more info).

       clone()
           Returns a deep copy of a "Geo::Gpx" instance.

             $clone = $self->clone;

   Methods
       waypoints( $int or name => $name )
           Without arguments, returns the array reference of waypoints.

           With an argument, returns a reference to the waypoint whose "name"
           field is an exact match with $name. If an integer is specified
           instead of the "name" key/value pair, returns the waypoint at
           position $int in the array reference (1-indexed with negative
           integers also counting from the end of the array).

           Returns "undef" if no corresponding waypoints are found such that
           this method can be used to check if a specific point exists (i.e.
           no exception is raised if $name or $int do not exist) .

       waypoints_add( $point or \%point [, $point or \%point, … ] )
           Add one or more waypoints. Each waypoint must be either a
           Geo::Gpx::Point or a hash reference with fields that can be parsed
           by Geo::Gpx::Point's new() constructor. See the later for the
           possible fields.

             %point = ( lat => 54.786989, lon => -2.344214, ele => 512, name => 'My house' );
             $gpx->waypoints_add( \%point );

               or

             $pt = Geo::Gpx::Point->new( %point );
             $gpx->waypoints_add( $pt );

       waypoints_search( $field => $regex )
           returns an array of waypoints whose $field (e.g. "name", "desc", …)
           matches $regex. By default, the regex is case-sensitive; specify
           "qr/(?i:search_string_here)/" to ignore case.

       waypoints_clip( $name | $regex | LIST )
       way_clip( )
           Sends the coordinates of the waypoint(s) whose name is either $name
           or matches $regex to the clipboard (all points found are sent to
           the clipboard) and returns an array of points found. By default,
           the regex is case-sensitive; specify "qr/(?i:...)/" to ignore case.

           Alternatively, an array of "Geo::GXP::Points" can be provided.
           way_clip() is a short-hand for this method (convenient when used
           interactively in the debugger).

           This method is only supported on unix-based systems that have the
           "xclip" utility installed (see DEPENDENCIES).

       waypoints_delete_all()
           delete all waypoints. Returns true.

       waypoint_delete( $name )
           delete the waypoint whose "name" field is an exact match for $name
           (case sensitively). Returns true if successful, "undef" if the name
           cannot be found.

       waypoint_rename( $name, $new_name )
           rename the waypoint whose "name" field is an exact match for $name
           (case sensitively) to $new_name. Returns the point's new name if
           successful, "undef" otherwise.

       waypoints_merge( $gpx, $regex )
           Merge waypoints with those contained in the Geo::Gpx instance
           provide as argument. Waypoints are compared based on their
           respective "name" fields, which must exist in $gpx (if names are
           missing in the current instance, all points will be merged).

           A $regex may be provided to limit the merge to a subset of
           waypoints from $gpx.

           Returns the number of points successfully merged (i.e. the
           difference in "$gps->waypoints_count" before and after the merge).

       waypoint_closest_to( $point or $tcx_trackpoint )
       trackpoint_closest_to( … )
       routepoint_closest_to( … )
       point_closest_to( … )
           From any Geo::Gpx::Point or Geo::TCX::Trackpoint object, return the
           Geo::Gpx::Point that is closest to it. If called in list context,
           returns a two-element array consisting of that point, and the
           distance from the coordinate (in meters).

       waypoints_print()
           print the list of waypoints to screen, along with their names and
           descriptions if defined. Returns true.

       waypoints_count()
           returns the number of waypoints in the object.

       routes( integer or name => 'name' )
           Returns the array reference of routes when called without argument.
           Optionally accepts a single integer referring to the route number
           from routes aref (1-indexed with negative integers also counting
           from the end of the array) or a key value pair with the name of the
           route to be returned.

       routes_add( $route or $points_aref [, name => $route_name )
           Add a route to a "Geo::Gpx" object. The $route is expected to be an
           existing route (i.e. a hash ref). Returns true. A new route can
           also be created based an array reference(s) of Geo::Gpx::Point
           objects and added to the "Geo::Gpx" instance.

           "name" and all other meta fields supported by routes can be
           provided and will overwrite any existing fields in $route.

       routes_delete_all()
           delete all routes. Returns true.

       routes_count()
           returns the number of routes in the object.

       tracks( integer or name => 'name' )
           Returns the array reference of tracks when called without argument.
           Optionally accepts a single integer referring to the track number
           from the tracks aref (1-indexed with negative integers also
           counting from the end of the array) or a key value pair with the
           name of the track to be returned.

       tracks_add( $track or $points_aref [, $points_aref, … ] [, name =>
       $track_name ] )
           Add a track to a "Geo::Gpx" object. The $track is expected to be an
           existing track (i.e. a hash ref). Returns true.

           If $track has no "name" field and none is provided, the timestamp
           of the first point of the track will be used (this is experimental
           and may change in the future). All other fields supported by tracks
           can be provided and will overwrite any existing fields in $track.

           A new track can also be created based an array reference(s) of
           Geo::Gpx::Point objects and added to the "Geo::Gpx" instance. If
           more than one array reference is supplied, the resulting track will
           contain as many segments as the number of aref's provided.

       tracks_delete_all()
           delete all tracks. Returns true.

       track_delete( $name )
           delete the track whose "name" field is an exact match for $name
           (case sensitively). Returns true if successful, "undef" if the name
           cannot be found.

       track_rename( $name, $new_name )
           rename the track whose "name" field is an exact match for $name
           (case sensitively) to $new_name. Returns the track's new name if
           successful, "undef" otherwise.

           Alternatively, an integer may be specified as the first argument,
           referring to the track number from tracks aref (1-indexed). This is
           a convenience as it is quite common for tracks to be named with the
           timestamp fo the first point.

       tracks_print()
           print the list of tracks to screen, by their "name" field. Returns
           true.

       tracks_count()
           returns the number of tracks in the object.

       iterate_waypoints()
       iterate_trackpoints()
       iterate_routepoints()
           Get an iterator for all of the waypoints, trackpoints, or
           routepoints in a "Geo::Gpx" instance, as per the iterator chosen.

       iterate_points()
           Get an iterator for all of the points in a "Geo::Gpx" instance,
           including waypoints, trackpoints, and routepoints.

               my $iter = $gpx->iterate_points();
               while ( my $pt = $iter->() ) {
                   print "Point: ", join( ', ', $pt->{lat}, $pt->{lon} ), "\n";
               }

       bounds( $iterator )
           Compute the bounding box of all the points in a "Geo::Gpx"
           returning the result as a hash reference.

             my $gpx = Geo::Gpx->new( xml => $some_xml );
             my $bounds = $gpx->bounds();

           returns a structure like this:

             $bounds = {
               minlat => 57.120939,
               minlon => -2.9839832,
               maxlat => 57.781729,
               maxlon => -1.230902
             };

           $iterator defaults to "$self->iterate_points" if not specified.

       xml( key/values )
           Generate and return an XML string representation of the instance.

           key/values are (all optional):

               "version":        specifies the GPX XML version scheme to use
           (defaults to 1.0).
               "unsafe_chars":   the set of characters to be considered unsafe
           for the XML mark-up and encoded as an entity.

           If "version" is omitted, it defaults to the value of the "version"
           attribute. Parsing a GPX document sets the version. If the
           "version" attribute is unset defaults to 1.0.

           "unsafe_chars" can be provided to specify which characters to
           consider unsafe in generating the XML mark-up. This field is then
           passed through to HTML::Entities function calls whose documentation
           describes that this field is "specified using the regular
           expression character class syntax (what you find within brackets in
           regular expressions)".

           As of version 1.11 of "Geo::Gpx", the default set of characters are
           the '<', '&', '>', '"' characters. To revert to the pre-version
           1.11 default, which is equivalent to that in <"HTML::Entities",
           explicitely specify "unsafe_chars => undef". This will encode as
           the latter module describes the "control chars, high-bit chars, and
           the '<', '&', '>', "'", '"' characters".

       TO_JSON
           For compatibility with JSON modules. Convert this object to a hash
           with keys that correspond to the above methods. Generated ala:

               my %json = map { $_ => $self->$_ }
                   qw( name desc author keywords copyright
                       time link waypoints tracks routes version );
               $json{bounds} = $self->bounds( $iter );

           With one difference: the keys will only be set if they are defined.

       save( filename => $fname, key/values )
           Saves the "Geo::Gpx" instance as a file.

           The filename field is optional unless the instance was created
           without a filename (i.e with an XML string or a filehandle) and
           set_filename() has not been called yet. If the filename is a
           relative path, the file will be saved in the instance's working
           directory (not the caller's, "Cwd").

           key/values are (all optional):

               "force":      overwrites existing files if true, otherwise it
           won't.
               "extensions": save "<extensions>…</extension>" tags if true
           (defaults to false).
               "meta_time":  save the "<time>…</time>" tag in the file's meta
           information tags if true (defaults to false). Some applications
           like MapSource return an error if this tags is present. (All other
           time tags elsewhere are kept.)
               "unsafe_chars":   see the documentation for xml() above.

       set_filename( $filename )
           Sets/gets the filename. Returns the name of the file with the
           complete path.

       set_wd( $folder )
           Sets/gets the working directory for any eventual saving of the
           *.gpx file and checks the validity of that path. It can be set as a
           relative path (i.e. relative to the actual Cwd) or as an absolute
           path, but is always returned as a full path.

           This working directory is always defined. The previous one is also
           stored in memory, such that set_wd('-') switches back and forth
           between two directories. The module never actually "chdir"'s, it
           just keeps track of where the user wishes to save files.

   Accessors
       name( $str )
       desc( $str )
       copyright( $str )
       keywords( $aref )
           Accessors to get or set the "name", "desc", "copyright", or
           "keywords" fields of the "Geo::Gpx" instance.

       author( $href )
           The author information is stored in a hash that reflects the
           structure of a GPX 1.1 document. To set it, supply a hash reference
           as ("link" and "email" are optional):
             {
               link  => { text => 'Hexten', href => 'http://hexten.net/' },
               email => { domain => 'hexten.net', id => 'andy' },
               name  => 'Andy Armstrong'
             },

       link( $href )
           The link is stored similarly to the author information, it can be
           set by supplying a hash reference as:
             { link  => { text => 'Hexten', href => 'http://hexten.net/' } }

       time( $epoch )
           Accessor for the <time> element of a GPX. The time is converted to
           a Unix epoch time when a GPX document is parsed, therefore only
           epoch time is supported for setting.

       version()
           Returns the schema version of a GPX document. Versions 1.0 and 1.1
           are supported.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       Prior to version 1.11, xml() and save() encoded "unsafe characters" as
       per the default in HTML::Entities which resulted in erroneous codes for
       some multi-byte unicode characters. The current default is to only
       encode a short list of characters -- see xml() above. This change is
       motivated by the now prevalent use of unicode as the default encoding
       in many applications that read XML markup and *.gpx files.
