NAME
       fselect - find files with SQL-like queries

SYNOPSIS
       fselect [ARGS] COLUMN [, COLUMN ...] [ from ROOT [, ROOT...] ] [where
       EXPR] [group by COLUMNS] [order by COLUMNS] [limit N] [into FORMAT]

DESCRIPTION
       fselect is a simple utility with a SQL-like query for finding files.

       You write SQL-like query, that's it.

       fselect command itself is like a first keyword (select, i.e., file
       select).  But if you'll put one more select behind occasionally, that's
       not a problem.

       Next you put columns you are interested in.  It could be file name or
       path, size, modification date, etc.  See full list of possible columns.
       You can add columns with arbitrary text (put in quotes if it contains
       spaces).  A few functions (aggregating and formatting) are there for
       your service.  You can use arithmetic expressions when it makes sense.

       Where to search? Specify with from keyword. You can list one or more
       directories separated with comma.  If you leave the from, then current
       directory will be processed.

       What to search? Use where with any number of conditions.

       Order results like in real SQL with order by.  All columns are
       supported for ordering by, as well as asc/desc parameters and
       positional numeric shortcuts.

       Limiting search results is possible with limit. Formatting options are
       supported with into keyword.

       If you want to use operators containing > or <, put the whole query
       into double quotes.  This will protect query from the shell and output
       redirection.  The same applies to queries with parentheses or *, ? and
       other special symbols that are shell metacharacters

ENVIRONMENT
       LS_COLORS
              Determines how to colorize search results, see dircolors(1).

EXIT STATUS
       The fselect utility exists with status 0 as long as the provided query
       parses correctly.

EXAMPLES
       Find files and directories that match the pattern 'needle':
              $ fselect name WHERE name =~ "needle"

       Start a search in a given directory (/var/log):
              $ fselect name FROM /var/log
