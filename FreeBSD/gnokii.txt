NAME
       gnokii - tool suite for mobile phones

SYNOPSIS
       gnokii [CONFIG OPTIONS] [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       gnokii is a multiple systems tool suite and driver for mobile phones.

       gnokii supports the AT protocol defined by the GSM standard (with
       workarounds for some vendor's quirks), some proprietary protocols of
       Nokia phones (the so called FBUS and FBUS2) and SIM cards in PC/SC
       compatible Smart Card readers.  Limited support for the older and slow
       Nokia MBUS protocol is also available.

       You can assume that your phone will work with gnokii when using the AT
       protocol, however some phones implement only a subset of the protocol
       and in those cases you will get very limited functionality.  The
       recommended model setting for your config file are:
        - model = series40, if you have a fairly recent Nokia phone except
       Symbian phones prior to Series60 3rd Edition
        - model = gnapplet, if you have a Nokia Symbian Series60 prior to 3rd
       Edition phone
        - model = AT, for all other phones of any brand
        - if you have some older Nokia phone that doesn't work with model =
       series40 you may try using its brand name, eg. for Nokia 6210 use model
       = 6210.

       The recommended connection and port settings for your config file are:
        - connection = bluetooth and port = phone address, for Bluetooth
       connections
        - connection = dku2libusb and port = 1, for most Nokia USB cables
        - connection = serial and port = /dev/..., for all other cables

       See also the sample gnokiirc for a description of all configuration
       parameters and our <http://wiki.gnokii.org/index.php/Config> for
       configurations known to work.

       Symbian series60 3rd edition and later (most Nokia N and E series) are
       not supported by the gnapplet driver due to changes in Symbian API. For
       now you can get some functionality using the AT driver (with all
       connection types supported by the phone) or using the series40 driver
       (only with connection = dku2libusb).

       Please note that currently there are Nokia models with almost the same
       names as the old ones, like 6110c vs 6110 or 3110c vs 3110. They are
       completly incompatible. DO NOT use model = 6110 or model = 3110 setting
       for them, use model = series40 instead.


CONFIG OPTIONS
       --config filename
              reads configuration from filename instead of trying default
              locations.  Normally gnokii looks for config file in
              $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gnokii/config (which is usually
              $HOME/.config/gnokii/config), $HOME/.gnokiirc (legacy),
              $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/gnokii/config (which is usually
              /etc/xdg/gnokii/config) and /etc/gnokiirc (legacy).

       --phone name
              usees parameters from the given phone section of your config
              file. A phone section named 'foo' starts with [phone_foo] and is
              used as --phone foo


OPTIONS
       The options that are recognized by gnokii can be divided into several
       different groups.


   GENERAL
       --help displays usage information.

       --version
              displays version and copyright information.

       --monitor [delay|once]
              continually updates phone status to stderr. Optional delay
              parameter sets the refresh interval to delay seconds. Default is
              1.  once means the output will be printed only once.

       --shell
              runs interactive session that will allow to run sequent gnokii
              commands without a need to reconnect for the sequent commands.


   DIALING
       --getspeeddial location
              reads speed dial from the specified location.

       --setspeeddial number memory_type location
              specify speed dial.  location number 1 is usually reserved for
              voice mailbox number and it is unavailable as speed dial.

       --dialvoice number
              initiate voice call.  On success print the callid identifier to
              be used with the --hangup command.  The --monitor command can be
              used to show the callid.

              With model = AT direct dialing from phonebooks is supported with
              careful use of shell quoting, for example:
               gnokii --dialvoice ">SM42"   # dial the number in location 42
              of SM memory
               gnokii --dialvoice '>"Home"' # dial the number if string
              matches exactly a contact name (note the use of single and
              double quotes)

       --senddtmf string
              send DTMF sequence.

       --answercall callid
              answer an incoming call.  callid is a small integer number used
              to identify one of the incoming calls.  The --monitor command
              can be used to show the callid.

       --hangup callid
              hangup an incoming call or an already established call.  callid
              is a small integer number used to identify one of the incoming
              calls.  If you initiated the call with --dialvoice this is the
              number printed by that command.  The --monitor command can be
              used to show the callid.

       --divert {--op|-o} {register|enable|query|disable|erasure} {--type|-t}
       {all|busy|noans|outofreach|notavail} {--call|-c} {all|voice|fax|data}
       [{--timeout|-m} time_in_seconds] [{--number|-n} number]
              Manage call diverting/forwarding.

              --op specifies one of the operations: register enable query
              disable erasure

              --type specifies one of the event types: busy noans outofreach
              notavail unconditional all

              --call specifies one of the call types: voice fax data all

              --timeout is the number of seconds an incoming call will ring
              before being forwarded to the registered number (use with --type
              noans)

              --number is the phone number to which calls are to be forwarded


   PHONE SETTINGS
       --getdisplaystatus
              shows what icons are displayed.

       --displayoutput
              show texts displayed in phone's screen.

       --getprofile [number]
              show settings for selected(all) profile(s).

       --setprofile
              sets settings for selected(all) profile(s).

       --getactiveprofile
              reads the active profile.

       --setactiveprofile profile_no
              sets active profile to the profile number profile_no.

       --netmonitor {reset|off|field|devel|next|nr}
              setting/querying netmonitor mode.

       --reset [soft|hard]
              resets the phone. By default a soft reset is performed.
              Depending on phone, the hard option also deletes everything in
              the internal memory and restores the factory settings.


   TODO
       --gettodo start_number [end_number|end] [-v|--vCal]
              get the notes with numbers from start_number to end_number from
              ToDo list.  end is a keyword that denotes 'everything till the

              -v | --vCal - output in vCalendar 1.0 format

       --writetodo vcalfile start_number [end_number|end]
              write the notes with numbers from start_number to end_number
              from vCalendar file vcalfile to ToDo list.  More than one note a
              time can be saved.  end is a keyword that denotes 'everything
              till the end'.

              number - location of the note in the vCalendar file

       --deletealltodos
              delete all notes from the ToDo list.

   SMS
       --getsms memory_type start [end] [-f|--file file] [-F|--force-file
       file] [-a|--append-file file] [-d|--delete]
              gets SMS messages from specified memory type starting at entry
              start and ending at end and print them to stdout by default.
              end can be a number or the string 'end'.  If end is not
              specified only one location - start is read.

              For the memory types you usually use IN (Inbox) and OU (Outbox)
              for Nokias and SM (SIM card) and ME (phone memory) for other
              brands, except for modern Motorolas that prefer MT (combined SIM
              and phone memory); in any case the --showsmsfolderstatus command
              shows the list of memory types available in your phone with
              their descriptions and message counts (each part of multipart
              messages is counted separately).

              -f | --file file - save messages to file in mbox format. If file
              already exists, user is prompted whether to overwrite it

              -F | --force-file file - save messages to file in mbox format.
              If file already exists, it is overwritten without asking

              -a | --append-file file - save messages to file in mbox format.
              If file already exists, messages are added to the end

              -d | --delete - delete message after reading.

       --deletesms memory_type start [end]
              deletes SMS messages from specified memory type starting at
              entry start and ending at end.  If end is not specified only one
              location - start is deleted.

       --sendsms destination [--smsc message_center_number | --smscno
       message_center_index] [-r|--report] [-8|--8bit] [-C|--class n]
       [-v|--validity n] [-i|--imelody] [-a|--animation file;file;file;file]
       [-o|--concat this;total;serial] [-w|--wappush url]
              sends an SMS message to destination via message_center_number or
              SMSC number taken from phone memory from address
              message_center_index.  If this argument is omitted SMSC number
              is taken from phone memory from location 1.  Message text is
              taken from STDIN.  Meaning of other optional parameters:

              -r | --report - request for delivery report

              -8 | --8bit - set 8bit coding

              -C | --class n - Class Message n, where n can be 0..3

              -v | --validity n - validity in minutes

              -i | --imelody - send iMelody within SMS

       --getmms memory_type start [end] [{--pdu|--raw} file] [-o|--overwrite]
              gets MMS messages from specified memory type starting at entry
              start and ending at end.  Default output format is human
              readable, alternative output formats are --pdu which is the
              binary format of MMS as received by the phone from the network
              and --raw which saves the data as read from the phone.

              When the -o or --overwrite option is used, existing files are

              detected are: NOL, NGG, NSM, NLM, BMP, I61, GGP, XPM. The OTA
              format can be used only if the filename ends with the .otb
              extension.

       Format of network_code parameter is 3 digits MCC, a space, 2 digits MNC
       surrounded by single or double quotes, eg. "123 45".


   RINGTONES

       --setringtone rtttlfile
              set the rtttlfile as ringtone (on 6110).


   PHONEBOOK
       --getphonebook memory_type start_number [end_number|end]
       [[-r|--raw]|[-v|--vcard]|[-l|--ldif]]
              reads specified memory location from phone.  If end_number is
              not specified only one location - start is read.  If instead of
              end_number the text end is specified then gnokii will read from
              start_number until it encounters a non-existant location.  Valid
              memory types are ME, SM, FD, ON, EN, DC, RC, MC, LD:

              ME Internal memory of the mobile equipment

              SM SIM card memory

              FD Fixed dial numbers

              ON Own numbers

              EN Emergency numbers

              DC Dialled numbers

              RC Received calls

              MC Missed calls

              LD Last dialed numbers

       Normally you get human readable output. Please note, that it is not
       compatible with expected input by --writephonebook.  You can use -v or
       --vcard switch to get output in vCard format or -l or --ldif switch to
       get output in ldif format or -r or --raw switch to get the raw output
       which is explained below.  You can use it then with --writephonebook.

       --writephonebook [-o|--overwrite] [-f|--find-free]
       [-m|--memory-type|--memory memory_type]
       [-n|--memory-location|--location number] [[-v|--vcard]|[-l|--ldif]]
              reads data from stdin and writes to phonebook.  Uses the format
              as provided by the output of the getphonebook command using
              --raw or --vcard or --ldif.  Default is raw format (see below
              for details) and alternate formats are vCard and ldif.  Default
              --getphonebook output format is not compatible with
              --writephonebook.

       With --memory-type memory_type and --memory-location number you can set
       a memory type and a location if the input data doesn't specify them.

       When the -o or --overwrite option is used, existing entries at a given
       location are overwritten.

       When the -f or --find-free option is given, gnokii tries to find a free
       location.  In this case, you can omit the location field in the input
       data.

       The raw phonebook format is very simple.  Each line represents one
       entry.  Fields are separated by semicolons.  Semicolons aren't allowed
       inside a field.  The fields have to be in this order (the subentries
       are optional, ie. you can repeat all subentry field multiple times, but
       they have to be alltogether in the given order):


            name


            number


            memory_type


            entry_location


            caller_group_number


            subentry_type


            subentry_number_type


            subentry_id


            subentry_text

       Possible values of caller_group_number and the corresponding caller
       groups are (these are defaults, you are able to change these manually
       in your phone):

              0 Family

              1 VIP

              2 Friends

              3 Colleagues

              4 Other

              5 No group

       Possible subentry types are described in the gnokii/common.h file:

              7 subentry is the name

              8 subentry is the email address

              9 subentry is the postal address (snail mail)

              10 subentry is the note (text field)

              11 subentry is the number

              12 subentry is the ringtone

              19 subentry is the date (used for DC, RD, LD)

              26 subentry is the pointer (pointer to the other memory)

              27 subentry is the logo (bitmap)

              28 subentry is the logo switch

   FILE
       Note that some phones (like Nokia 6610i) support only id based
       operations (gnokii options with "byid" suffix). Use gnokiifs for the
       transparent support.

       --getfilelist remote_path
              lists files from the given directory. Use A:\* or B:\* to get

   MISC
       --keysequence
              emulates pressing keys on phone keyboard.  Input is read from
              stdin.

              Supported keys (any other char is ignored):

                   M menu

                   N names

                   P power

                   G green phone

                   R red phone

                   U up

                   D down

                   + increase volume

                   - decrease volume

                   0123456789#* as is

              Example: to increase volume

                echo "+" | gnokii --keysequence

              Note: this command isn't supported by all phones/drivers.


       --enterchar
              emulates typing a character on phone keyboard.  By emulating
              multiple pressions of keys, it can input all characters
              supported by the phone in use, but to input an SMS predictive
              text should be disabled.  Input is read from stdin, with newline
              interpreted as the "Menu" key and escape interpreted as the
              "Names" key.

              Note: this command isn't supported by all phones/drivers.


       --listnetworks
              prints a list of cellular network operators with their 3-digits
              MCC (Mobile country code) and 2-digits MNC (Mobile Network
              Code).

              Note: this command doesn't need a valid config or a phone to
              work.


       --getnetworkinfo
              prints information about the network currently in use.


DIAGNOSTICS
       Various error messages are printed to standard error.  The exit code is
       0 for correct functioning.  Errors which appear to be caused by invalid
       or abused command line parameters cause an exit code of 2, and other
       errors cause an exit code of 1.


BUGS
       We write quality software here ;) but see KNOWN_BUGS just in case. If
       you'd like to send us the bugreport please read the README and Bugs
