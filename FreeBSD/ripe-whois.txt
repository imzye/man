NAME
       whois3 - query RIPE Whois server

SYNOPSIS
       whois3 [-h host | --host= host ] [-p port | --port= port ]
       [whois_options] [whois_query]

       whois3 [-h host | --host= host ] [-p port | --port= port ] -k

DESCRIPTION
       whois3 allows you to query the RIPE Whois server, whois.ripe.net.  Most
       options specified are passed through unchanged to the Whois server.
       You can specify an alterate server name and port through the host and
       port options.

       To perform a single query, specify any desired flags and the query as
       arguments to whois3 .  The query will be performed and the results
       displayed.

       To perform multiple queries, use the -k option.  Then each query is
       read from input, sent to the server, and the result displayed.
       Standard input redirection operators work as expected, allowing you to
       perform batches of queries by redirecting input from a file or another
       program.

OPTIONS
       -h host | --host=host
              Query the server host instead of the default server,
              whois.ripe.net.  You may specify either the host name or IP
              address.

       -p port | --port=port
              Use the port port.  If not specified, then the system default
              port is used if defined, otherwise port 43 is used.

       -4     Send query using ipv4 interface(s).

       -6     Send query using ipv6 interface(s).

       -k     Send multiple queries to the server.  Each line of standard
              input is read and sent as a query to the server.  Note that if
              this option is specified then no query can be specified on the
              command line.  Also, this option only works with servers that
              implement the RIPE extensions to the Whois query protocol.

DETAILS ABOUT THE RIPE WHOIS SERVER
       The RIPE Whois server responds to queries based on their format, as
       documented in the following sections.  These queries and options only
       apply to the RIPE Whois server.

QUERIES USING PRIMARY AND LOOKUP KEYS
       <ip-lookup> (IPv4 address prefix, range or single address)
              Returns inetnum, route objects with exact match on a specified
              key. If the exact match does not exist, the objects with the
              smallest less specific match. When single address is specified,
              an inet-rtr object is also returned whose ifaddr attribute
              matches the query argument.

       <ip-lookup> (IPv6 address or IPv6 prefix)
              Returns inet6num object with exact match on a specified key. If
              the exact match does not exist, the object with the smallest
              less specific match is returned.

       <as-number>
              Returns an aut-num object whose aut-num attribute matches the
              query argument and as-block object with the range containing the
              aut-num object, if it exists.

       <as-number> - <as-number> (range of <as-number> separated by '-')
              Returns an as-block object whose primary key defines a range
              that matches or fully contains the range specified in the query
              argument.

       <domain-name>
              Returns domain and inet-rtr objects whose primary keys match the
              query argument. For domains a referral query may be performed.
              In such case the actual query is performed by the referred
              server and the results are transparently passed to the client.
              See the RIPE Database Reference Manual section 2.7 "Referral
              mechanism for domains" for more information.

       <person-name>
              Returns all person and role objects whose person or role
              attribute contains the name specified in the query argument.

       <set-name>
              Returns a set whose primary key matches the query argument.

       <nic-handle>
              Returns a person or role object whose nic-hdl attribute matches
              the query argument.

       <mntner-name>
              Returns a mntner object whose primary key matches the query
              argument.

IP ADDRESS LOOKUPS
       -l <ip-lookup>
              Returns first level less specific inetnum, inet6num or route
              objects, excluding exact matches.

       -L <ip-lookup>
              Returns all level less specific inetnum, inet6num or route
              objects, including exact matches.

       -m <ip-lookup>
              Returns first level more specific inetnum, inet6num or route
              objects, excluding exact matches.

       -M <ip-lookup>
              Returns all level more specific inetnum, inet6num or route
              objects, excluding exact matches.

       -x <ip-lookup>
              Requests that only an exact match on a prefix be performed. If
              no exact match is found no objects are returned.

       -d <ip-lookup>
              Enables use of the -m, -M, -l and -L flags for lookups on
              reverse delegation domains.

INVERSE QUERIES
       -i ac (-i admin-c) <nic-hanlde> or <person-name>
              Returns all objects whose admin-c attribute matches the query
              argument.

              the query argument.

       -i pn <nic-hanlde> or <person-name>
              Returns all objects whose admin-c, tech-c, zone-c, author or
              cross-nfy attribute matches the query argument.

              attribute of the set.  Absence of mbrs-by-ref attribute means
              that the membership is only defined by members attribute of the
              set.

       -i mb (-i mnt-by) <mntner-name>

              argument.

QUERY SUPPORT FOR TOOLS
       -F     Produce output using short hand notation for attribute names.

       -K     Requests that only the primary keys of an object to be returned.
              The exceptions are set objects, where the members attributes
              will also be returned. This flag does not apply to person and
              role objects.

       -k (optional normal query)
              Requests a persistent connection. After returning the result the
              connection will not be closed by the server and a client may
              issue multiple queries on the same connection. Note, that server
              implements 'stop-and-wait' protocol, when no next query can be
              sent before receiving a reply for the previous one. Except the
              first -k query, -k without an argument closes the persistent
              connection.

       -g (mirroring request)
              Request a NRTM stream from the server. See the RIPE Database
              Reference Manual section 4. "Mirroring the RIPE Database" for
              more information".

MISCELLANEOUS QUERIES
       -R     Switches off use referral mechanism for domain lookups, so that
              the database returns an object in the RIPE database with the
              exact match with the lookup argument, rather than doing a
              referral lookup.

       -r     Switches off recursion for contact information after retrieving
              the objects that match the lookup key.

       -T (comma separated list of object types, no white space is allowed)
              Restricts the types of objects to lookup in the query.

       -a     Specifies that the server should perform lookups in all
              available sources.  See also "-q sources" query.

       -s (comma separated list of sources, no white space is allowed)
              Specifies which sources and in which order are to be looked up
              when performing a query.

INFORMATIONAL QUERIES
       -q sources
              Returns the current set of sources along with the information
              required for mirroring. See the RIPE Database Reference Manual
              section 2.9 "Other server features" for more information.

       -q version
              Displays the current version of the server.

       -t <object-type>
              Requests a template for the specified object type.

       -V<client-tag>
              Sends information about the client to the server.

       -v <object-type>
              Requests a verbose template for the specified object type.
