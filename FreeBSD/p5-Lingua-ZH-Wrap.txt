NAME
       Lingua::ZH::Wrap - Wrap Chinese text

VERSION
       This document describes version 0.03 of Lingua::ZH::Wrap, released July
       25, 2004.

SYNOPSIS
   Example 1
           use Lingua::ZH::Wrap;

           $initial_tab = "\t";        # Tab before first line
           $subsequent_tab = "";       # All other lines flush left

           print wrap( $initial_tab, $subsequent_tab, @lines );

   Example 2
           use Lingua::ZH::Wrap qw(wrap $columns $overflow);

           $columns  = 75;             # Change columns
           $overflow = 1;              # Chinese char may occupy 76th col

           print wrap( '', '', @lines );

DESCRIPTION
       Lingua::ZH::Wrap::wrap() is a very simple paragraph formatter.  It
       formats a single paragraph at a time by breaking lines at Chinese
       character boundries.

       Indentation is controlled for the first line ($initial_tab) and all
       subsequent lines ($subsequent_tab) independently.  Please note:
       $initial_tab and $subsequent_tab are the literal strings that will be
       used: it is unlikely you would want to pass in a number.

OVERRIDES
       Lingua::ZH::Wrap::wrap() has a number of variables that control its
       behavior.

       Lines are wrapped at $Lingua::ZH::Wrap::columns columns; if a Chinese
       character just extends columns by one byte, it will be wrapped into the
       next line, unless $Lingua::ZH::Wrap::overflow is set to a true value.

CAVEATS
       The algorithm doesn't care about breaking non-Chinese words.  Also, if
       you pass in strings encoded unicode, it will currently first decode
       into "Big5", do the conversion, then convert back.

       Patches are, of course, very welcome; in particular, I'd like to use
       Lingua::ZH::TaBE to avoid beginning-of-line punctuations, as well as
       employing other semantic-sensitive formatting techniques.
