NAME
       Math::Geometry::Voronoi - compute Voronoi diagrams from sets of points

SYNOPSIS
           use Math::Geometry::Voronoi;

           # load a set of points
           my @points = ([1,   2],
                         [1,   3],
                         [2,   2],
                         [0,   1],
                         [0,   10],
                         [0.5, 11]);
           my $geo = Math::Geometry::Voronoi->new(points => \@points);

           # compute your diagram
           $geo->compute;

           # extract features
           my $lines    = $geo->lines;
           my $edges    = $geo->edges;
           my $vertices = $geo->vertices;

           # build polygons
           my @polygons = $geo->polygons;

DESCRIPTION
       This module computes Voronoi diagrams from a set of input points.  Info
       on Voronoi diagrams can be found here:

         http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram

       This module is a wrapper around a C implementation found here:

         http://www.derekbradley.ca/voronoi.html

       Which is itself a modification of code by Steve Fortune, the inventor
       of the algorithm used (Fortune's algorithm):

         http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/sjf/

       I made changes to the C code to allow reading input and writing output
       to/from Perl data-structures.  I also modified the memory allocation
       code to use Perl's memory allocator.  Finally, I changed all floats to
       doubles to provide better precision and to match Perl's NVs.

INTERFACE
   new
           my @points = ([1,   2],
                         [1,   3],
                         [2,   2],
                         [0,   1],
                         [0,   10],
                         [0.5, 11]);
           my $geo = Math::Geometry::Voronoi->new(points => \@points);

       Create a new object, passing in a single required parameter called
       'points'.  This must be an array or arrays containing at least two
       values each, the X,Y values for your points.  Any extra data will be
       ignored.

   points
       Returns the sorted set of points used by the voronoi algorithm.  This
       is the ordering refered to by the lines() output below.

   compute
       Call this to build the diagram.  Returns nothing.

   lines
       Returns an array ref containing arrays of lines in the output diagram.
       The data by index:

         0: the a value in the ax + by = c equation for the line
         1: the b value
         2: the c value
         3: the index of one point for which this line is the bisector.
         4: the index of the other point for which this line is the bisector.

       Note that 3 and 4 are not the end-points of the line - they are points
       perpendicular to the line.  Either 3 or 4 may be -1 meaning no point.

   vertices
       Returns an array ref containing arrays of vertices in the output
       diagram.  These are the points which connect edges running along the
       lines.  The data by index:

         0: the x value
         1: the y value

   edges
       Returns an array ref containing arrays of edges in the output diagram.
       An edge is defined as a segment of a line running between two vertices.
       The data by index:

         0: the index of the line
         1: the index of vertex 1
         2: the index of vertex 2

       Either 1 or 2 can be -1 meaning "infinite".

   polygons
         @polys = $geo->polygons();

       This method attempts to assemble polygons from non-infinite edges in
       the diagram.  This part of the code is written in Perl and is of my own
       invention.  I needed this facility in order to color the diagrams
       created by this module.  It seems to work reasonably well for my uses
       but I'm sure it's nowhere near the quality of Steve Fortune's code!
       Feedback welcome.

       This method returns a reference to an array containing first a point
       index and then a list of vertex coordinates.  The point is the point
       inside the polygon and the vertices are in drawing order for the closed
       polygon surrounding the point.  For example:

         @polys = ( $point_index, [$lat1, $lon1], [$lat2, $lon2], ... );

       One optional parameter is available - normalize_vertices.  This option
       is necessary because the algorithm used needs to match up points from
       one edge to another and doing that with floating point numbers requires
       some kind of normalization (otherwise 1.1 != 1.10001).  For example, if
       your coordinates are on an integer grid you might do:

         @polys = $geo->polygons(normalize_vertices => sub { int($_[0]) });

       Or if you're using floating point and your coordinates are useful down
       to 2 decimal places:

         @polys = $geo->polygons(normalize_vertices => sub { sprintf("%.2f", $_[0]) });

       The point is to produce coordinates in a format where they will compare
       as equal textually, side-stepping the problem of comparing floats
       numerically.

TODO
       Possible projects, if you're in the mood to help out:

         - Add the ability to combine polygons based on a mapping of
           same-type points.  Map overlays get cluttered by internal lines
           with you're coloring multiple polygons the same.  All edges
           connect exactly two polygons, so this should be relatively easy.
           Sadly, my limited math skills have thwarted me on this one - I
           spent several days but ultimately couldn't get it working reliably
           on all possible shapes.

         - Remove the need for the normalize_vertices option to polygons(),
           somehow (fuzzy matching?).

         - Setup a site where people can play with the module visually and
           see purty colors.  Could be an excuse to play with the new canvas
           stuff in modern browsers.

         - Add tests that actually examine the output for sanity. So far the
           tests just look at the format and range of the output data - to
           see if it's actually doing a decent diagram I look at graphical
           output.
