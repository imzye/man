NAME
       MooX::Thunking - Allow Moo attributes to be "thunked"

SYNOPSIS
         package Thunking;
         use Moo;
         use MooX::Thunking;
         use Types::TypeTiny -all;
         use Types::Standard -all;
         has children => (
           is => 'thunked',
           isa => ArrayRef[InstanceOf['Thunking']],
           required => 1,
         );

         package main;
         my $obj;
         $obj = Thunking->new(children => sub { [$obj] });

DESCRIPTION
       This is a Moo extension. It allows another value for the "is" parameter
       to "has" in Moo: "thunked". If used, this will allow you to
       transparently provide either a real value for the attribute, or a
       "CodeLike" in Types::TypeTiny that when called will return such a real
       value.

       Note that in earlier versions of this module (up to 0.06), any "isa"
       had to pass a "CodeLike". This is now taken care of by this module. It
       will continue to do the right thing if no "isa" is supplied.
