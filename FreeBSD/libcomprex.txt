NAME
       comprex-config - Get information about a libcomprex installation

SYNOPSIS
       comprex-config [options]

DESCRIPTION
       comprex-config displays information about a previous libcomprex
       installation.

OPTIONS
       --help Displays the available options.

       --version
              Outputs version information about the installed libcomprex.

       --cflags
              What set of CFLAGS that was used when libcomprex was built. This
              is mostly a debug option that serves no particular use to most
              people.

       --libs Shows the complete set of libs and other linker options you will
              need in order to link your application with libcomprex.

       --prefix[=DIR]
              If specified, use DIR instead of the installation prefix that
              libcomprex was built with when computing the output for the
              --cflags and --libs options.  This option is also used for the
              exec prefix if --exec-prefix was not specified.

       --exec-prefix[=DIR]
              If specified, use DIR instead of the installation exec prefix
              that libcomprex was built with when computing the output for the
              --cflags and --libs options.
