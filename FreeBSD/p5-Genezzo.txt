NAME
       Genezzo - an extensible database with SQL and DBI

SYNOPSIS
         # partial DBI interface
         use Genezzo::GenDBI;

         # Users can directly create and manipulate database tables using
         # gendba.pl, an interactive line-mode tool.

DESCRIPTION
         The Genezzo modules implement a hierarchy of persistent hashes using
         a fixed amount of memory and disk.  This system is designed to be
         easily configured and extended with custom functions, persistent
         storage representations, and novel data access methods.  In its
         current incarnation it supports a subset of SQL and a partial
         DBI interface.

GETTING STARTED
         The simplest way to create an instance of a Genezzo database is to use:

           gendba.pl -init

         This command will create a new database and login to the
         command-line.  Typing "help" on the command line will list the
         available commands.  Additional help for gendba.pl is available via
         "gendba.pl -help".
