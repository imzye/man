Term::Bash::Completion::Generator(3)       User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Term::Bash::Completion::Generator - Generate bash completion scripts

SYNOPSIS
         # use default bash completion options
         generate_bash_completion_function('my_command', ['option1', ''option2']) ;

         # fine tune with the bash completion options
         generate_bash_completion_function('my_command', ['option1', ''option2'], '-*', 0, '-o plusdirs')

DESCRIPTION
       Generate bash completion functions or perl scripts to dynamically
       provide completion for an application.

DOCUMENTATION
       If you application or scripts have more than one or two options and you
       run a bash shell, it is advisable you provide a completion file for
       your application.

       A completion file provides information to bash so when your user
       presses [tab], on the command line, possible completion is provided to
       the user.

       This module provide you with subroutines to create the completion
       scripts. The completion scripts are either simple bash functions or
       scripts that allow you to dynamically generate completion. The scripts
       can be written in any language. This module generate scripts that are
       written in perl.

       The perl scripts can be generated  by calling the subroutine i this
       module or by running the generate_perl_completion_script script
       installed with this module.

       The generated scripts can provide completion for applications written
       in any language. A good place to generate completion is in your
       Build.PL or Makefile.PL. Remember to test your completions too.

BASH COMPLETION DOCUMENTATION
       Run 'man bash' on your prompt and search for 'Programmable Completion'.

       bash-completion-20060301.tar.gz library, an older but useful archive of
       completion functions for common commands.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
   generate_perl_completion_script($command, \@completion_list)
       Generates a perl script that can be used to dynamically generate
       completion for the bash command line.

       Tree::Trie is used in the script to do the basic look-up. Tree::Trie
       was installed as dependency to this module. Modify the generated script
       to implement your completion logic.

       You can also use the generate_perl_completion_script script to create
       the perl completion script from the command line.

       Arguments

       • $command - a string containing the command name

       • \@completion_list - list of options to create completion for

         the options can be simple strings or a Getopt::Long specifications

       Returns - an array containing:

       • a string containing the bash completion command

       • a string containing the perl script

       Exceptions - carps if $command is not defined

       source the following line in your ~/.bashrc:

       EOC

       $perl_completion_script .= <<"EOC" ; complete
       $bash_completion_arguments

       EOC

       $perl_completion_script .= <<'EOC' ; Replace perl_completion_script
       with the name you saved the script under. The script has to be
       executable and somewhere in the path.

       The script will receive these arguments from bash:

       @ARGV |- 0 = command |- 1 = word_to_complete `- 2 =
       word_before_the_word_to_complete

       You return possible completion you want separated by \n. Return nothing
       if you want the default bash completion to be run which is possible
       because of the <-o defaul> passed to the complete command.

       Note! You may have to re-run the complete command after you modify your
       perl script.

   generate_bash_completion_function($command, \@completion_list,
       $completion_prefix, $single_and_double_dash, $complete_options)
       Generates a bash function that provides completion for the options
       passed as parameter.  The options can be simple strings like
       'output_directory' or 'a' or Getopt::Long specifications like
       'j|jobs=i', 'd|display_documentation:s', or 'o'.

       Note that the options do not have any dash at the start.

       Arguments

       • $command - a string containing the command name

       • \@completion_list - list of options to create completion for

         the options can be simple strings or a Getopt::Long specifications

       • $completion_prefix - see bash manual ; default is '-*'

       • $single_and_double_dash - boolean variable ; default is 1

         0 - single dash for single letter options, double dash for multiple
         letters options 1 - all options have single and double dash

       • $complete_options - string containing the options passed to complete
         ; default is '-o default'

       Returns - a string containing the bash completion script

       Exceptions - carps if $command is not defined

   de_getop_ify_list(\@completion_list)
       Split Getopt::Long option definitions and remove type information

       Arguments

       • \@completion_list - list of options to create completion for

         the options can be simple strings or a Getopt::Long specifications

       Returns - an array reference

       Exceptions - carps if $completion_list is not defined
