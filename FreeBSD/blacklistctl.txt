BLACKLISTCTL(8)         FreeBSD System Manager's Manual        BLACKLISTCTL(8)

NAME
     blacklistctl – display and change the state of blacklistd

SYNOPSIS
     blacklistctl dump [-abdnrw]

DESCRIPTION
     blacklistctl is a program used to display the state of blacklistd(8)

     The following options are available:

     -a      Show all database entries, by default it shows only the embryonic
             ones.

     -b      Show only the blocked entries.

     -d      Increase debugging level.

     -n      Don't display a header.

     -r      Show the remaining blocked time instead of the last activity
             time.

     -w      Normally the width of addresses is good for IPv4, the -w flag,
             makes the display wide enough for IPv6 addresses.

NOTES
     Sometimes the reported number of failed attempts can exceed the number of
     attempts that blacklistd(8) is configured to block.  This can happen
     either because the rule has been removed manually, or because there were
     more attempts in flight while the rule block was being added.  This
     condition is normal; in that case blacklistd(8) will first attempt to
     remove the existing rule, and then it will re-add it to make sure that
     there is only one rule active.

HISTORY
     blacklistctl first appeared in NetBSD 7.  FreeBSD support for
     blacklistctl was implemented in FreeBSD 11.
