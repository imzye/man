NAME
       File::Slurp::Tiny - A simple, sane and efficient file slurper
       [DISCOURAGED]

VERSION
       version 0.004

SYNOPSIS
        use File::Slurp::Tiny 'read_file';
        my $content = read_file($filename);

DISCOURAGED
       This module is discouraged in favor of File::Slurper. While a useful
       experiment, it turned out to be both too similar to File::Slurp (still
       containing most problematic features of File::Slurp's interface) and
       yet not similar enough to be a true drop-in replacement.

       Bugs will still be fixed, but new features will probably not be added.

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides functions for fast and correct slurping and
       spewing. All functions are optionally exported.

FUNCTIONS
   read_file($filename, %options)
       Reads file $filename into a scalar. By default it returns this scalar.
       Can optionally take these named arguments:

       •   binmode

           Set the layers to read the file with. The default will be something
           sensible on your platform.

       •   buf_ref

           Pass a reference to a scalar to read the file into, instead of
           returning it by value. This has performance benefits.

       •   scalar_ref

           If set to true, "read_file" will return a reference to a scalar
           containing the file content.

   read_lines($filename, %options)
       Reads file $filename into a list/array. By default it returns this
       list. Can optionally take these named arguments:

       •   binmode

           Set the layers to read the file with. The default will be something
           sensible on your platform.

       •   array_ref

           Pass a reference to an array to read the lines into, instead of
           returning them by value. This has performance benefits.

       •   chomp

           "chomp" the lines.

   write_file($filename, $content, %options)
       Open $filename, and write $content to it. Can optionally take this
       named argument:

       •   binmode

           Set the layers to write the file with. The default will be
           something sensible on your platform.

   read_dir($dirname, %options)
       Open "dirname" and return all entries except "." and "..". Can
       optionally take this named argument:

       •   prefix

           This will prepend $dir to the entries

SEE ALSO
       •   Path::Tiny

           A minimalistic abstraction not only around

       •   File::Slurp

           Another file slurping tool.
