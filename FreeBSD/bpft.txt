SYNOPSIS
     traflog [-V]
     traflog -l [-i iface | file] [-b num] [-e num] [-r]
     traflog -d [-i iface | file] [-fnN] [pattern | -F file]
     traflog [-aAfnNrs] [-i iface | file] [-b num] [-e num] [-o format]

DESCRIPTION
     traflog show traffic statistic from trafd statistics file (see trafd(8)).

     There need write detailed description...


     Default output formatted to 7 columns:

     (to) Port    packet's destination port (for tcp or udp)

     -b        Begin record number (-b "#24") or time (-b yymmddhhmm).

     -d        Print pattern table (use for test pattern).

               f, from

               t, to

               b, bytes

               s, srcport

               d, dstport

     -V        Print version number and exit.

     -w file   Binary output to file

     pattern   Filter expression (see later).


USAGE
     Traflog output details:

     From      Source IP address (numeric) or domain name (FQDN)

     Srcport   Source IP port (number or name from /etc/services)

     To        Destination IP address (numeric) or domain name (FQDN)

     Dstport   Destination IP port (number or name from /etc/services)

     Data      IP data frame summary sizes for this line (sub-protocol datagra
               sizes summ)

     All       IP datagram summary sizes for this line (IP traffic value)


     To display all possible protocol names edit /etc/protocols (or take new
     file from IANA http/ftp server) please.
