NAME
       pwm - an X11 window manager

SYNOPSIS
       pwm [options]

DESCRIPTION
       PWM is a rather lightweight window manager that can have multiple
       client windows attached to a single frame. This feature helps keeping
       windows, especially the numerous xterms, organized.

              X display to manage

       -cfgfile configfile
              Config file to use instead of default

       -onescreen
              On X servers with multiple screens, manage only default screen,
              not all.

       -help  Show help on command line options

       -version
              Show version

       -about Show about text
