NAME
       Astro::SIMBAD - An object orientated interface to CDS' SIMBAD database

DESCRIPTION
       This module does nothing, and is here as a placeholder in case of need.
       The user interface to the goodness wrapped in the SIMBAD package can be
       found in the Astro::SIMBAD::Query module.

       $Id: SIMBAD.pm,v 1.4 2005/06/08 01:43:04 aa Exp $

METHODS
       The Astro::SIMBAD module itself has no methods, and is just a
       placeholder module, see Astro::SIMBAD::Query for the actual interface.
