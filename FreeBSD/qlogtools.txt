multipipe(1)            FreeBSD General Commands Manual           multipipe(1)

NAME
       multipipe - supervise an pipeline of commands

SYNOPSIS
       multipipe [ directory ]

DESCRIPTION
       multipipe starts one supervise process for each subdirectory of the
       current directory.  multipipe skips subdirectory names starting with
       dots.  Each supervised processes is piped a copy of standard input sent
       to multipipe.

       Every five seconds, multipipe checks for subdirectories again.  If it
       sees a new subdirectory, it starts a new supervise process.  If a
       subdirectory is removed, it closes the pipe to that supervise process.
       Directory named supervise or with names starting with a period are
       ignored.

       If multipipe is given a command-line argument, it switches to that
       directory when it starts.

       If multipipe is sent either the INT, QUIT, or the TERM signal, or it
       reaches end of file on standard input, it runs svc -dx on each command
       to shut it down, and waits for it to exit.

RETURN VALUE
       Exits 0 when all the commands are shut down.
