NAME
       Sys::Trace - Interface to system call tracing interfaces

SYNOPSIS
         use Sys::Trace;

         my $trace = Sys::Trace->new(exec => [qw(ls foo)]);

         $trace->start; # Returns a PID which you can watch
         $trace->wait;  # Alternatively call this to wait on the PID

         my $result = $trace->results; # Returns a Sys::Trace::Results object

         use Cwd;
         print $result->files(getcwd . "/"); # Should show an attempt to look at "foo"
                                             # in the current directory (i.e. "ls
                                             # foo", above)

DESCRIPTION
       Provides a way to programmatically run or trace a program and see the
       system calls it makes.

       This can be useful during testing as a way to ensure a particular file
       is actually opened, or another hard to test interaction actually
       occurs.

       Currently supported tracing mechanisms are ktrace, strace and truss.

METHODS
   new(%args)
       Keys in %args can be:

       •   exec: Program and arguments to execute

       •   pid: PID of program to trace

       •   follow_forks: Follow child processes too (default is 1, set to 0 to
           disable)

       Only one of exec or pid must be provided.

   start
       Start running the trace.

   wait
       Wait for the trace to finish

   results
       Return a Sys::Trace::Results object populated with the results of the
       trace.

BUGS
       This does what I wanted, it is probably woefully incomplete in places.
