MUTTPRINT(1)                Muttprint Short Manual                MUTTPRINT(1)


NAME
       muttprint - pretty printing of mails with Mutt

SYNOPSIS
       muttprint [options]... [-f file]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the Muttprint utility. This manual
       page was written originally written for the Debian GNU/Linux
       distribution because the original program did not have a manual page,
       but now I took over this man page in POD-format.

       Muttprint is a utility that formats the printing of Mutt and other mail
       clients like XFMail or PINE to be like the printing of Netscape
       Messenger or Kmail. It can print a little penguin on the first page and
       a headline on every page. Furthermore, it only prints the most
       important headers, but not the whole plethora of them.

       For detailed information about Muttprint look read the User's guide in
       PDF and HTML format at /usr/local/share/doc/muttprint/.

       Anyway, you have to put the following line in your
       /usr/local/etc/Muttrc or ~/.muttrc:

               set print_command="muttprint"

       If you want to customize the settings of Muttprint, just copy
       /usr/local/share/doc/muttprint/sample-muttprintrc-en to
       /usr/local/etc/Muttprintrc or ~/.muttprintrc in reliance if you want
       change the settings for the whole system or one user.

       Muttprint defaults to English language settings if the environment
       variable LANG is not set.  For example in a German environment you
       should set:

               export LANG=de_DE

       This can for instance be done in in your local ~/.bashrc. For a more
       detailed information about localization of Muttprint read the User's
       guide.

OPTIONS
       PLEASE NOTICE: This options override the corresponding settings in
       ~/.muttprintrc and /usr/local/etc/Muttprintrc.

       And here's the description of all command line options (a descriptions
       of the settings in the rcfile is included in the sample-muttprintrc-en
       distributed with Muttprint):

       -h, --help
              Prints a list of all possible options.

       -v, --version
              Prints the current version of Muttprint.

       --print-locale
              Prints out information about the current locale environment and
              exits.

       -f file, --file file
              Reads from file instead of STDIN. Useful for some mail clients
              as XFMail.  If file is -, Muttprint reads from STDIN.

       -p printername, --printer printername
              Uses another printer than the default printer or the setting in
              the rcfile.  You can also print in file using
              TO_FILE:/path/to/file as printer name. If you would like to have
              the result in STDOUT, set the printer name to -.

       -C print command, --printcommand print command
              Sets the command which is used for printing to print command.
              Thereby the string $PRINTER is replaced by the specified printer
              name.  CUPS support could be activated by CUPS; alternatively
              you can specify any command that contains the string
              $CUPS_OPTIONS which is replaced by the options used for CUPS.

       -i file, --penguin file
              Takes file as picture printed on the right top of the sheet.
              file must contain the full path. Set file to off if you wouldn't
              like to print a picture.

       -x, --x-face | -nox, --nox-face
              Turns on or off the printing of the picture which was
              transmitted in the X-Face: header. Read the documentation for a
              detailed explanation.

       -t number, --speed number
              This is the amount of time in seconds which your printer needs
              to print one page. It is only necessary if you use duplex
              printing.  Default is 30 (seconds).

       -w number, --wait number
              Amount of time in seconds which Muttprint should wait between
              printing odd and even pages for duplex printing.

       -F fontname, --font fontname
              Here you can choose a nice font family for your printing.
              Possible are: Latex, Latex-bright, Latin-modern, Times, Utopia,
              Palatino, Charter, Bookman, CentSchool, Chancery, Helvetica and
              AvantGarde.  If all fonts are available on your system depends
              of your installed LaTeX-system. Default is Latex.

       -H, --headrule | -noH, --noheadrule
              Here you can choose whether it should be printed a rule after
              the top line on pages greater than 2 or not.

       -b, --footrule | -nob, --nofootrule
              Here you can choose whether it should be printed a rule over the
              foot line or not.

       -S style, --frontstyle style
              Choose a style for the printing of the mail headers on the first
              page: plain, border (default), Border, fbox, shadowbox, ovalbox,
              Ovalbox, doublebox, grey, greybox. Read the manual for a
              detailed description of this values.

       -a headers, --printed-headers headers
              Specify the headers that should be printed. Separate each header
              with "_". Headers that are embedded in * are printed bold; use /
              for italic printing. If a header does not exist, it will be
              omitted.  The given order is the same as on the printing.

              Two examples:

                      Date_To_From_CC_Newsgroups_*Subject*   (default)
                      /Date/_To_From_X-Mailer_*/Subject/*

       -P paperformat, --paper paperformat
              Choose your paper format: A4 in most countries ("DIN A4" in
              Germany) and letter in the U.S.

       -e String, --date String
              This option accepts two settings: original and local. If you use
              original, the date will be printed unchanged as it appears in
              the mail header, i. e. in English and in the sender's time zone.
              If set to local, the date will be printed in the local language
              and in the system's time zone. See the options --date-format and
              --lang.

              Examples:

                      original: Tue, 15 Jan 2002 21:43:49 +0100
                      local:    Dienstag, 15. Januar 2002 21:43:49
                                        (German locale)

       -E String, --date-format String
              This options allows you to change the date format (if you've
              chosen local before). The argument is a format string according
              to strftime(3), e. g.:

                      "%A, %d. %B %Y %H:%M:%S" (standard in Germany)
                      "%a, %d.%m.%y %H:%M"     (shorten form)
                      "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"      (ISO format)

       -A String, --addressformat String
              With this option you can set how mail addresses are printed. The
              value original does not change the header. Otherwise you have to
              specify a format string; following substitutions are done:

                      %r              name ("real name")
                      %a              mail address
                      \n              newline

              The default setting is %r <%a>,\n. Moreover, you can emphasize
              some parts with bold or italic printing. You have to enclose
              these parts with stars ("*") for bold or with slashes ("/") for
              italics.

              Example:

                      "/%r/ (%a),"

              The quotes are necessary because the string contains spaces.
              Otherwise the shell splits the string into two parts.

       -n String, --verbatimnormal String
              This sets the options which are passed to the Verbatim
              environment that is necessary to print the normal mail text.
              Detailed explanations are in the user's guide. Some examples:

                      fontshape=it           italic fonts
                      frame=topline          border above the block
                      fontfamily=helvetica   Helvetica font
                      fontsize=\Huge         huge font

              To combine options, you have to separate each option with a
              comma, e. g.  fontshape=it,fontseries=b.

       -V String, --verbatimsig String
              Same as --verbatimnormal, but this sets how the signature is
              printed. If the argument is raw, there is now discrimination
              between normal text and signature.

       -D, --debug | -noD, --nodebug
              Choose whether Muttprint writes to a log file
              /tmp/muttprint.log.  Useful to ask some other about help if
              Muttprint doesn't work.

       -B, --background | -noB, --nobackground
              After reading from standard input, Muttprint runs in the
              background.  The advantage is that the you can use mail client
              immediately after start printing. The disadvantage is that error
              message could not be printed anymore. So use this option only if
              Muttprint works error-free on your system.

       -d, --duplex | -nod, --noduplex
              Enables or disables duplex printing. If enabled, Muttprint
              prints only odd pages and waits some time before it prints even
              pages.

       -2 | -1
              Prints two pages on one sheet as shown here:

                      +----------+----------+
                      |          |          |
                      |          |          |
                      |    1     |     2    |
                      |          |          |
                      |          |          |
                      |          |          |
                      +----------+----------+

              This feature is called papersave mode in the manual and in the
              rcfile.

       -g number, --topmargin number
              Sets the top margin in millimeters.

       -G number, --bottommargin number
              Sets the bottom margin in millimeters.

       -j number, --leftmargin number
              Sets the left margin in millimeters.

       -J number, --rightmargin number
              Sets the right margin in millimeters.

       -s, --rem_sig | -nos, --norem_sig
              Removes the signature (separated by "-- ") in the printing. This
              is useful for very long signatures. But more and more people (or
              mail clients) doesn't separate the signature correctly so this
              feature works not always, see also the next option.

       --sig_regexp Regular Expression
              Sets the regular expression (in Perl syntax) used to recognize
              signatures.  The default is ^-- $.

       -q, --rem_quote | -noq, --norem_quote
              Remove the quoted paragraph from the printing.

              Muttprint detects the quoting with the same regular expression
              as Mutt, so it should work.

       -z size, --fontsize size
              Specifies the font size. Possible values are 10pt, 11pt and
              12pt.

       -W number, --wrapmargin number
              Controls how long the longest line could be. Longer lines are
              wrapped automatically and the paragraph will be reformatted.

       -r file, --rcfile file
              Specifies another configuration file, which is read additionally
              to /usr/local/etc/Muttprintrc and ~/.muttprintrc. This file
              overwrites all other settings, including this one which are done
              by command line parameters. (It makes no sense to include other
              options despite -f if you use this option.)
