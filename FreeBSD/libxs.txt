XS_BIND(3)                   Crossroads I/O Manual                  XS_BIND(3)



NAME
       xs_bind - accept connections on a socket

SYNOPSIS
       int xs_bind (void *socket, const char *endpoint);

DESCRIPTION
       The xs_bind() function shall create an endpoint for accepting
       connections and bind it to the socket referenced by the socket
       argument.

       The endpoint argument is a string consisting of two parts as follows:
       transport://address. The transport part specifies the underlying
       transport protocol to use. The meaning of the address part is specific
       to the underlying transport protocol selected.

       The following transports are defined:

       inproc
           local in-process (inter-thread) communication transport, see
           xs_inproc(7)

       ipc
           local inter-process communication transport, see xs_ipc(7)

       tcp
           unicast transport using TCP, see xs_tcp(7)

       pgm, epgm
           reliable multicast transport using PGM, see xs_pgm(7)

       With the exception of XS_PAIR sockets, a single socket may be connected
       to multiple endpoints using xs_connect(), while simultaneously
       accepting incoming connections from multiple endpoints bound to the
       socket using xs_bind(). Refer to xs_socket(3) for a description of the
       exact semantics involved when connecting or binding a socket to
       multiple endpoints.

RETURN VALUE
       The xs_bind() function shall return endpoint ID if successful.
       Otherwise it shall return -1 and set errno to one of the values defined
       below.

ERRORS
       EINVAL
           The endpoint supplied is invalid.

       ENAMETOOLONG
           The supplied name was too long.

       EPROTONOSUPPORT
           The requested transport protocol is not supported.

       ENOCOMPATPROTO
           The requested transport protocol is not compatible with the socket
           type.

       EADDRINUSE
           The requested address is already in use.

       EADDRNOTAVAIL
           The requested address was not local.

       ENODEV
           The requested address specifies a nonexistent interface.

       ETERM
           The context associated with the specified socket was terminated.

       ENOTSOCK
           The provided socket was invalid.

EXAMPLE
       Binding a publisher socket to an in-process and a TCP transport.

           /* Create a XS_PUB socket */
           void *socket = xs_socket (context, XS_PUB);
           assert (socket);
           /* Bind it to a in-process transport with the address 'my_publisher' */
           int rc = xs_bind (socket, "inproc://my_publisher");
           assert (rc != -1);
           /* Bind it to a TCP transport on port 5555 of the 'eth0' interface */
           rc = xs_bind (socket, "tcp://eth0:5555");
           assert (rc != -1);
