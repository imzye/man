NAME
       ad - AppleDouble file utility suite

SYNOPSIS
       ad {ls | cp | mv | rm} [...]

DESCRIPTION
       ad is an AppleDouble file utility suite with Netatalk compatibility.
       AppleDouble data (extended attributes of files, ._files in same
       directories or files in .AppleDouble directories) and the CNID
       databases are updated as appropriate when files in a shared Netatalk
       volume are modified.

           FinderFlags (valid for (f)iles and/or (d)irectories):

             d = On Desktop                      (f/d)
             e = Hidden extension                (f/d)
             m = Shared (can run multiple times) (f)
             n = No INIT resources               (f)
             i = Inited                          (f/d)
             c = Custom icon                     (f/d)
             t = Stationery                      (f)
             s = Name locked                     (f/d)

           AFP Attributes:

             y = System                          (f/d)
             w = No write                        (f)
             p = Needs backup                    (f/d)
             r = No rename                       (f/d)
             l = No delete                       (f/d)
             o = No copy                         (f)

           Note: any letter appearing in uppercase means the flag is set but it's a directory for which the flag is not allowed.

AD CP
       Copy files and directories.

       In the first synopsis form, the cp utility copies the contents of the
       src_file to the dst_file. In the second synopsis form, the contents of
       each named src_file is copied to the destination dst_directory. The
       names of the files themselves are not changed. If cp detects an attempt
       to copy a file to itself, the copy will fail.

       When a copy targeting an AFP volume is detected, its CNID database
       daemon is connected and all copies will also go through the CNID
       database. AppleDouble data are also copied and created as needed when
       the target is an AFP volume.

       Options:

       -a
           Archive mode. Same as -Rp.

       -f
           For each existing destination pathname, remove it and create a new
           file, without prompting for confirmation regardless of its
           permissions. (The -f option overrides any previous -i or -n
           options.)

       -i
           Cause cp to write a prompt to the standard error output before
           copying a file that would overwrite an existing file. If the
           response from the standard input begins with the character 'y' or
           'Y', the file copy is attempted. (The -i option overrides any
           previous -f or -n options.)

       -n
           Do not overwrite an existing file. (The -n option overrides any
           previous -f or -i options.)

       -p
           Cause cp to preserve the following attributes of each source file
           in the copy: modification time, access time, file flags, file mode,
           user ID, and group ID, as allowed by permissions. If the user ID
           and group ID cannot be preserved, no error message is displayed and
           the exit value is not altered.

       -R
           If src_file designates a directory, cp copies the directory and the
           entire subtree connected at that point. If the src_file ends in a
           /, the contents of the directory are copied rather than the
           directory itself.

       -v
           Cause cp to be verbose, showing files as they are copied.

       -x
           File system mount points are not traversed.

AD MV
       Move files and directories.

       Move files around within an AFP volume, updating the CNID database as
       needed. If either:

       •   source or destination is not an AFP volume

       •   source AFP volume != destination AFP volume

       the files are copied and removed from the source.

       Options:

       -f
           Do not prompt for confirmation before overwriting the destination
           path. (The -f option overrides any previous -i or -n options.)

       -i
           Cause mv to write a prompt to standard error before moving a file
           that would overwrite an existing file. If the response from the
           standard input begins with the character `y' or `Y', the move is
           attempted. (The -i option overrides any previous -f or -n options.)

       -n
           Do not overwrite an existing file. (The -n option overrides any
           previous -f or -i options.)

       -v
           Cause mv to be verbose, showing files after they are moved.

AD RM
       Remove files and directories.

       The rm utility attempts to remove the non-directory type files
       specified on the command line. If the files and directories reside on
       an AFP volume, the corresponding CNIDs are deleted from the volumes
       database.

       The options are as follows:

       -R
           Attempt to remove the file hierarchy rooted in each file argument.

       -v
           Be verbose when deleting files, showing them as they are removed.
