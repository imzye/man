DIGITEMP(1)             FreeBSD General Commands Manual            DIGITEMP(1)

NAME
       digitemp - program to read from 1-wire temperature sensors.

SYNOPSIS
       digitemp [options]

DESCRIPTION
       DigiTemp uses the Dallas 1-wire bus to read temperatures from digital
       sensors attached to a serial port adapter. It handles initializing the
       bus, searching for attached devices, reading devices and custom log
       strings. It supports the following temperature devices: DS1820,
       DS18S20, DS18B20, DS1822

       It also handles the DS2406 1-wire hub switches, and DS2422 and DS2423
       counters.

       DigiTemp uses either the DS9097 passive serial port adapter, or the
       DS2480B based DS9097U adapter. 1-wire adapters from ibuttonlink.com,
       such as the Link45 are also supported.

OPTIONS
       At least 1 action must be given, along with some optional arguments.
       Actions are one (and only on) of the -w -t -a -w options

       -h, -? Show summary of options.

       -v     Show verbose output.

       -i     Initialize .digitemprc file, search the bus for all supported
              devices.

       -I     Initialize .digitemprc file, search the bus for all supported
              devices, store devices in sorted serial # order.

       -w     Walk the full device tree and display the serial number and type
              of all devices detected on the bus.

       -s /dev/cuau0
              Set serial port to use. Make sure you have permission to access
              this port. For USB operation pass USB instead of /dev/cuauX

       -l /var/log/temperature
              Send output to logfile, the output format is defined by the .B
              -o command

       -c digitemp.conf
              Set digitemp configuration file. The default is .digitemprc in
              the current directory.

       -r 1000
              Read delay in ms. This sets the amount of time to wait between
              sending the temperature conversion command and reading the
              result. The DS18S20 takes about 750mS to do the temperature
              conversion. Default is 1000mS (1 sec).

       -t #   Read sensor number #, the # depends on the order of the sensors
              in the .digitemprc file.

       -q     Quiet output, no copyright banner.

       -a     Read all sensors.

       -A     Treat DS2438 as A/D converter, output raw voltages and currents.

       -d 5   Delay between samples (in seconds).

       -n 50  Number of times to repeat the command.

       -O"counter format string"
              See Counter Format below.

       -o [1..3] ["output format string"]
              See Temperature Format below.

       -H"Humidity format string"
              See Humidity Format below.

Temperature Format
       The temperature format can be either a numeric value, or a string. The
       numeric values select pre-configured output formats:

           1 = One line per sensor, time, C, F (default)
           2 = One line per sample, elapsed time, temperature in C
           3 = Same as #2, except temperature is in F

       #2 and #3 have the data separated by tabs, suitable for import into a
       spreadsheet or other graphing software.

       The format string uses strftime tokens plus 5 special ones for
       DigiTemp:

       %s     for sensor #

       %C     for centigrade

       %F     for fahrenheit

       %R     to output the hex serial number

       %N     for seconds since Epoch.

       The case of the token is important! The default format string is: "%b
       %d %H:%M:%S Sensor %s C: %.2C F: %.2F" which gives you an output of:
       May 24 21:25:43 Sensor 0 C: 23.66 F: 74.59

       The DS2438 sensor can be used for a variety of things. It includes a
       temperature sensor and A/D converter. DigiTemp defaults to using it as
       a humidity sensor. The raw voltages and currents can be displayed by
       passing the -A argument

       When the -o2 or -o3 log options are used the attached DS2438's
       temperatures will be output without the humidity.

Counter Format String
       The counter format string is similar, adding these tokens:

       %n     is the counter #, which depends on its position in the
              .digitemprc file

       %C     is the count in decimal.

Humidity Format String
       The Humidity format string is the same as the temperature format string
       with the addition of this format specifier:

       %h     is the humidity in 0-100%
