NAME
       pmath - simple command line interface to Math::Cephes

SYNOPSIS
         bash> pmath

        Interactive interface to the Math::Cephes module.
        TermReadLine enabled. Type 'help' or '?'  for help.

        pmath> setprec 4
                display set to 4 decimal places
        pmath> cos($PI)
                -1.0000
        pmath> acos(%)
                 3.1416
        pmath> q
        bash>

DESCRIPTION
       This script provides a simple command line interface to the
       "Math::Cephes" module. If available, it will use the "Term::ReadKey"
       and "Term::ReadLine::Perl" or "Term::ReadLine::GNU" modules to provide
       command line history and word completion.

       Typing "help" or "?" alone will provide a list of help topics grouped
       by major category name. "help category" will provide a listing and
       short description of each function within the named category. "help
       function" will provide a description and synopsis of the named
       function.

       Entering an expression that returns a single value, such as sin($x), or
       one that returns multiple values, such as airy($x), will result in all
       return values being printed.  The last (successful) single value
       returned is saved as the "%" symbol (as in Maple), so that one can do

            pmath> sin($PI/2)
                   1
            pmath> asin(%)
                   1.570796
            pmath>

       The number of decimal places displayed can be set to "j" using "setprec
       j":

            pmath> setprec 8
                    display set to 8 decimal places
            pmath> $PI
                    3.14159265
            pmath>

       Multiple statements can be entered on a line, such as
            pmath> $x=1; $y=exp($x); printf("\texp(%5.2f)=%5.2f\n",$x,$y);
                    exp( 1.00)= 2.72
            pmath>

       or on multiple lines using "\" as a continuation signal:

           pmath> $x = 1; \
                  $y = exp($x); \
                   printf("exp(%5.2f)=%5.2f\n", $x, $y);
                    exp( 1.00)= 2.72
           pmath>

       To quit the program, enter "q", "quit", or "exit".

       The "Math::Cephes" module has some support for handling fractions and
       complex numbers through the "Math::Cephes::Fraction" and
       "Math::Cephes::Complex" modules. For fractions, one can use the fract()
       function to create a fraction object, and then use these in a fraction
       routine:

           pmath> $f=fract(1,3); $g=fract(4,3); $f->radd($g);
                   5/3
           pmath> mixed(%)
                   1 2/3
           pmath>

       Similarly, for complex numbers one can use the cmplx() function to
       create a complex number object, and then use these in a complex number
       routine:

           pmath> $f=cmplx(1,3); $g=cmplx(4,3); $f->cadd($g);
                   5+6 i
           pmath>

       See Math::Cephes::Polynomial for an interface to some polynomial
       routines, and Math::Cephes::Matrix for some matrix routines.
