NEWKEY(8)               FreeBSD System Manager's Manual              NEWKEY(8)

NAME
     newkey – create a new key in the publickey database

SYNOPSIS
     newkey -h hostname
     newkey -u username

DESCRIPTION
     The newkey utility is normally run by the network administrator on the
     Network Interface Service (NIS) master machine in order to establish
     public keys for users and super-users on the network.  These keys are
     needed for using secure RPC or secure NFS .

     The newkey utility will prompt for the login password of the given
     username and then create a new public/secret key pair in /etc/publickey
     encrypted with the login password of the given user.

     Use of this program is not required: users may create their own keys
     using chkey(1).

OPTIONS
     -h hostname
             Create a new public key for the super-user at the given hostname.
             Prompts for the root password of the given hostname.

     -u username
             Create a new public key for the given username.  Prompts for the
             NIS password of the given username.

SEE ALSO
     chkey(1), keylogin(1), publickey(5), keyserv(8)

NOTES
     The Network Information Service (NIS) was formerly known as Sun Yellow
     Pages (YP).  The functionality of the two remains the same; only the name
     has changed.
