send_nsca.cfg(5)              The NSCA-ng Manual              send_nsca.cfg(5)

NAME
       send_nsca.cfg - NSCA-ng client configuration file

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/local/etc/send_nsca.cfg

DESCRIPTION
       The send_nsca(8) process reads configuration data from the file
       specified with -c on the command line or from
       /usr/local/etc/send_nsca.cfg.

   File Format
       Configuration settings are defined by specifying a variable name
       followed by an equals sign (“=”) and a value, one setting per line.
       Values can be strings or integers.  Strings have to be enclosed in
       single or double quotes if they contain whitespace characters, hash
       mark characters, or literal quotation marks.  Otherwise, quoting is
       optional.  To specify a literal single or double quote in a string,
       either escape it by preceding it with a backslash (“\”) or quote the
       string using the other quote character.  A literal backslash must be
       preceded with a second backslash.

       Any whitespace surrounding tokens is ignored.  Empty lines and comments
       are also ignored.  Comments are introduced with a hash mark character
       (“#”) and span to the end of the line.  If the last character of a line
       is a backslash (“\”), the subsequent line is treated as a continuation
       of the current line (and the backslash is otherwise ignored).

   Settings
       The send_nsca(8) client recognizes the following variables.  They may
       appear in arbitrary order.  The type of each value is denoted after an
       equals sign in angle brackets.

       delay = <integer>
              Wait for a random number of seconds between 0 and the specified
              delay before contacting the server.  This might be useful to
              reduce the server load if many send_nsca(8) clients are invoked
              simultaneously.  The default setting is 0, which tells
              send_nsca(8) to connect to the server immediately.  The
              specified value will be ignored if send_nsca(8) is called with
              the -D option.

       encryption_method = <string>
              This setting is ignored.  It is accepted for compatibility with
              NSCA 2.x.

       identity = <string>
              Send the specified client identity to the server.  The client
              identity is used for authentication and authorization.  The same
              identity may be provided by multiple clients.  By default, the
              local host name will be used.

       password = <string>
              Use the specified passphrase for authentication and encryption.
              The default password is “change-me”.  Change it!

       port = <string>
              Connect to the specified service name or port number on the
              server instead of using the default port (5668).  The specified
              value will be ignored if send_nsca(8) is called with the -p
              option.

       server = <string>
              Connect and talk to the specified server address or host name.
              The default server is “localhost”.  The specified value will be
              ignored if send_nsca(8) is called with the -H option.

       timeout = <integer>
              Close the connection if the server didn't respond for the
              specified number of seconds.  If the timeout is set to 0,
              send_nsca(8) won't enforce connection timeouts.  The default
              timeout is 15 seconds.  The specified value will be ignored if
              send_nsca(8) is called with the -o option.

       tls_ciphers = <string>
              Limit the cipher suites offered during the TLS negotiation to
              the specified list of ciphers.  The format of the string is
              described in the ciphers(1) manual.  By default, the ciphers in
              the list
              PSK-AES256-CBC-SHA:PSK-AES128-CBC-SHA:PSK-3DES-EDE-CBC-SHA:PSK-RC4-SHA
              will be offered.

EXAMPLES
       The /usr/local/etc/send_nsca.cfg file might look similar to the
       following example.

              identity = "web-checker"
              password = "djMKCIcurJJLSQGT5qIhCfqCHQLTcvp9"
              server = "monitoring.example.com"
              tls_ciphers = "PSK-AES256-CBC-SHA"
              delay = 2
              port = 5668
              timeout = 10

CAVEATS
       Please set the permissions appropriately to make sure that only
       authorized users can access the /usr/local/etc/send_nsca.cfg file.
