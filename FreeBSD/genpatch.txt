DUPE(1)                 FreeBSD General Commands Manual                DUPE(1)

NAME
     dupe – duplicate a file quickly

SYNOPSIS
     dupe original

DESCRIPTION
     This utility is always called by portfix(1), but sometimes it is useful
     in its own right.

     dupe takes exactly one argument, a path to a file.  It will duplicate the
     [original] file to "<original>.orig" unless there is already an existing
     file with this exact name.  In that case, the target file name will be
     "<original>.intermediate" and any existing file of that name will be
     unconditionally overwritten.

ERRORS
     dupe will abort if zero or more than one argument is given, or if
     [original] is not a path to a valid regular file.
