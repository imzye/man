GPSCORRELATE(1)                                                GPSCORRELATE(1)

NAME
       gpscorrelate - correlates digital photos with GPS data filling EXIF
       fields

SYNOPSIS
       gpscorrelate [-g file.gpx] [option...]

       gpscorrelate-gui

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the gpscorrelate and
       gpscorrelate-gui commands.

       This manual page was written for the Debian(TM) distribution because
       the original programs do not have a manual page. Instead, they have
       documentation in HTML format; see below.

       gpscorrelate is a program that acts on digital photo in JPEG format
       filling EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) fields related to GPS
       (Global Positioning System) information. Source for the GPS data is a
       record of GPS information encoded in GPX (GPS Exchange Format) Format.
       The act of filling those fields is referred to as correlation.

       If GPS data are available at the precise moment the photo was taken
       (with a 1-second granularity) the GPS data are stored unmodified in
       EXIF fields. If they are not linear interpolation of GPS data available
       at moments before and after the photo was taken can be used.

       gpscorrelate is a command line tool implementing correlation whereas
       gpscorrelate-gui is the corresponding GTK+ graphical user interface.

OPTIONS
       These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
       options starting with two dashes (`-'). A summary of options is
       included below. For a complete description, see the HTML documentation.

       -g, --gps
          required, specifies GPX file with GPS data

       -z, --timeadd +/-XX[:XX]
          time to add to GPS data to make it match photos. GPS data is in UTC;
          photos are not likely to be in UTC. Enter the timezone used when
          taking the photos: eg, +8 for Perth

       -i, --no-interpolation
          disable interpolation between points. Interpolation is linear,
          points are rounded if disabled

       -v, --verbose
          show what has been selected

       -d, --datum datum
          specify measurement datum. If not set, WGS-84 used

       -n, --no-write
          do not write the exif data. Useful with --show

       -m, --max-dist time
          max time outside points that photo will be matched. Time is in
          seconds

       -s, --show
          Just show the GPS data from the given files, if it exists

       -o, --machine
          Just show the GPS data from the given files, machine readable output

       -r, --remove
          Strip GPS tags from the given files, and then quit

       -t, --ignore-tracksegs
          Interpolate between track segments too

       -M, --no-mtime
          Do not change mtime of modified files

       -h, --help
          Show summary of options.
