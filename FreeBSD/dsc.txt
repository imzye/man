NAME
       dsc - DNS Statistics Collector

SYNOPSIS
       dsc [ -dfpmiTv ] dsc.conf

DESCRIPTION
       DNS Statistics Collector (dsc) is a tool used for collecting and
       exploring statistics from busy DNS servers.  It can be set up to run on
       or near nameservers to generate aggregated data that can then be
       transported to central systems for processing, displaying and
       archiving.

       Together with dsc-datatool the aggregated data can be furthur enriched
       and converted for import into for example InfluxDB which can then be
       accessed by Grafana for visualzation, see this wiki on how to set up
       that:

              https://github.com/DNS-OARC/dsc-datatool/wiki/Setting-up-a-test-
              Grafana

       dsc will chroot to a directory on startup and output statistics into
       files in various formats.

       See dsc.conf(5) on how to configure dsc, what formats exists, their
       structure and output filenames.

KNOWN ISSUES
       This program and/or components uses select(2) to wait for packets and
       there may be an internal delay within that call during startup that
       results in missed packets.  As a workaround, set pcap_thread_timeout (
       see dsc.conf(5) ) to a relevant millisecond timeout with regards to the
       queries per second (QPS) received.  For example if your receiving 10
       QPS then you have 20 packets per second (PPS) and if spread out equally
       over a second you have a packet per 50 ms which you can use as timeout
       value.  Since version 2.4.0 the default is 100 ms.
