NAME
       snort-rep - snort-reporting tool

SYNOPSIS
       snort-rep [OPTIONS] [syslog-file]

DESCRIPTION
       snort-rep is a Snort reporting tool that can produce text or HTML
       output from a syslog file. If syslog-file is not specified, it will use
       standard-input. The reports contain:

       •   Portscan summary

       •   Alert Summary by ID

       •   Alert summary by remote host and ID

       •   Alert summary by local host and ID

       •   Alert summary by local port and ID

       It is designed to be used for daily e-mail reports to the system
       administrators (see snort-rep-mail for an example script that generates
       daily e-mails). All reports contain priority information (if used with
       Snort 1.8+) and the HTML output contains direct links to the IDS
       descriptions of whitehats.com.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           Print usage.

       -r, --resolve
           Resolve host names.

       -s, --source=SOURCE[,SOURCE...]
           Read information from SOURCE (in addition to syslog-file). This
           option can be specified multiple times. If syslog-file is not
           specified and no --sources option is used, standard input will be
           read in syslog format.

           SOURCE is a comma separated list of sources which may be:

           syslog:FILE
               Syslog file FILE

           fast:FILE
               Snort "fast-alert" file FILE

       -t, --text
           Print text report (default). If both --text and --html are
           specified, both will be printed, separated by a line like '<<<<<'
           (79 times '<').

       --text-width=n
           Try to fit the text report to n columns. Default: 79.

       -H, --html
           Print HTML report.

       -l, --local=NET[,NET...]
           NET is a local network. This options can be specified more than
           once and can contain more than one network (comma-separated). NET
           must be specified as "network/mask", for example "192.168.1.0/24".

       -F, --local-file=FILE
           FILE contains list of local networks, as given in -l (one network
           per line).  FILE can contain hash comments and empty lines.

       -R, --remove-name=REGEX
           Remove REGEX from host names. This option is useful to make nicer
           host names for local hosts.

       --priority-med=N
           Priorities greater or equal N will be considered "medium priority"
           (default: 7).

       --priority-high=N
           Priorities greater or equal N will be considered "high priority"
           (default: 16). High-priority alerts will be pushed on the top of
           the reports.

       -N, --narrow
           Try to make the reports better fit on the screen by trimming too
           long host-names and placing spaces in the alert descriptions so
           that they can be word-wrapped.
