Object::Tiny::Lvalue(3)                    User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Object::Tiny::Lvalue - minimal class builder with lvalue accessors

SYNOPSIS
       Define a class:

         package Foo;
         use Object::Tiny::Lvalue qw( bar baz );
         1;

       Use the class:

         my $object = Foo->new( bar => 1 );
         printf "bar is %s\n", $object->bar;
         $object->bar = 2;
         printf "bar is now %s\n", $object->bar;

DESCRIPTION
       This is a clone of Object::Tiny, but adjusted to create accessors that
       return lvalues.

       You probably want to use Object::Properties instead.
