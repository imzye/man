NAME
       ghosts - provides a wrapper for the routines in
       SystemManagement::Ghosts

SYNOPSIS
       ghosts [OPTIONS] SYSTEMS

        SYSTEMS is a combination of ghost macros.  See --help for more details.

        -h, --help            Display full help

DESCRIPTION
       Parses the /etc/ghosts file for matching hosts.  The first word of each
       line is the "hostname", and each other word on the line represents that
       host's membership in a given group.  In the example below, there are
       two machines ("bilbo", "baggins") in the "prod" group, one ("tolkien")
       in the "e450" group, etc:

               # Macros
               sunprod=solaris^e450
               # Machines
               #
               # Name          Group           Hardware        OS
               bilbo           prod            intel           linux
               baggins         prod            e4500           solaris
               tolkien         devel           e450            solaris

       Machine groups can be combined logically with the "+" and "^"
       characters to produce composite groups.  For example:

               $ ghosts intel+e450
               bilbo tolkien
               $ ghosts prod^intel
               baggins

       The gsh(1) command can be used to run remote SSH connections to hosts.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
               Displays this full help.

       -g, --ghosts CONFIG_FILE
               Uses the provided ghosts configuration file, instead of
               /etc/ghosts. This means /etc/ghosts will not be read at all.
