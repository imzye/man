MooseX::Types::DateTime::MoreCoercions(3)  User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       MooseX::Types::DateTime::MoreCoercions - Extensions to
       MooseX::Types::DateTime

VERSION
       version 0.15

SYNOPSIS
           package MyApp::MyClass;

           use MooseX::Types::DateTime::MoreCoercions qw( DateTime );

           has created => (
               isa => DateTime,
               is => "rw",
               coerce => 1,
           );

           my $instance = MyApp::MyClass->new(created=>'January 1, 1980');
           print $instance->created->year; # is 1980

           ## Coercions from the base type continue to work as normal.
           my $instance = MyApp::MyClass->new(created=>{year=>2000,month=>1,day=>10});

       Please see the test case for more example usage.

DESCRIPTION
       This module builds on MooseX::Types::DateTime to add additional custom
       types and coercions.  Since it builds on an existing type, all
       coercions and constraints are inherited.

SUBTYPES
       This module defines the following additional subtypes.

   DateTime
       Subtype of "DateTime" in MooseX::Types::DateTime.  Adds an additional
       coercion from strings.

       Uses DateTimeX::Easy to try and convert strings, like "yesterday" into
       a valid DateTime object.  Please note that due to ambiguity with how
       different systems might localize their timezone, string parsing may not
       always return the most expected value.  IN general we try to localize
       to UTC whenever possible.  Feedback welcomed!

   Duration
       Subtype of "Duration" in MooseX::Types::DateTime that coerces from a
       string.  We use the module Time::Duration::Parse to attempt this.

CAVEATS
       Firstly, this module uses DateTimeX::Easy which is way more DWIM than
       any sane person would desire. DateTimeX::Easy works by falling back
       until something makes sense, this is variable. Furthermore, all the
       modules that DateTimeX::Easy *can* use aren't required for "proper"
       function of DateTimeX::Easy. What does this mean? Simple, your mileage
       may vary in your coercions because DateTimeX::Easy is installation
       specific.
