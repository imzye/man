NAME
       ctmconv - file format converter for 3D models

SYNOPSIS
       ctmconv infile outfile [options]

DESCRIPTION
       ctmconv is a 3D file converter that can convert 3D model files to and
       from several different formats.

       The file infile is loaded, and then saved as outfile in the target file
       format.

       The input and output file formats are determined from the file endings.

OPTIONS
       The following options are available:

       --scale arg     Scale the mesh by a scalar factor.

       --upaxis arg    Set up axis (X, Y, Z, -X, -Y, -Z). If != Z, the mesh
                       will be flipped.

       --flip          Flip triangle orientation.

       --calc-normals  If the source file does not contain any normals,
                       calculate them.

       --no-normals    Do not export normals.

       --no-texcoords  Do not export texture coordinates.

       --no-colors     Do not export vertex colors.

       --comment arg   Set the file comment (default is to use the comment
                       from the input file, if any).

       --texfile arg   Set the texture file name reference for the texture
                       (default is to use the texture file name reference from
                       the input file, if any).

       When exporting an OpenCTM file, the following options are also
       available:

       --method arg    Select compression method (RAW, MG1, MG2).

       --level arg     Set the compression level (0 - 9).

       --vprec arg     Set vertex precision (only for MG2).

       --vprecrel arg  Set vertex precision, relative method (only for MG2).

       --nprec arg     Set normal precision (only for MG2).

       --tprec arg     Set texture map precision (only for MG2).

       --cprec arg     Set color precision (only for MG2).

FILE FORMATS
       The following 3D model file formats are supported: OpenCTM (.ctm),
       Stanford triangle format (.ply), Stereolitography (.stl), 3D Studio
       (.3ds), COLLADA 1.4/1.5 (.dae), Wavefront geometry file (.obj),
       LightWave object (.lwo), Geomview object file format (.off), VRML 2.0 -
       export only (.wrl).

AVAILABILITY
       ctmconv is designed to be portable, and is available for several
       different systems, including (but not limited to): Windows, Mac OS X
       (10.3+), Linux and OpenSolaris.
