VOP_GETACL(9)          FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual         VOP_GETACL(9)

NAME
     VOP_GETACL – retrieve access control list for a vnode

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <sys/vnode.h>
     #include <sys/acl.h>

     int
     VOP_GETACL(struct vnode *vp, acl_type_t type, struct acl *aclp,
         struct ucred *cred, struct thread *td);

DESCRIPTION
     This vnode call may be used to retrieve the access control list (ACL)
     from a file or directory.

     Its arguments are:

     vp    The vnode of the file or directory.

     type  The type of ACL to retrieve.

     aclp  A pointer to an ACL structure to receive the ACL data.

     cred  The user credentials to use in authorizing the request.

     td    The thread requesting the ACL.

     The cred pointer may be NULL to indicate that access control checks are
     not to be performed, if possible.  This cred setting might be used to
     allow the kernel to authorize ACL retrieval that the active process might
     not be permitted to do.

     The vnode ACL interface defines the syntax, and not semantics, of file
     and directory ACL interfaces.  More information about ACL management in
     kernel may be found in acl(9).

LOCKS
     The vnode will be locked on entry and should remain locked on return.

RETURN VALUES
     If the aclp pointer will point to a valid ACL, then zero is returned.
     Otherwise, an appropriate error code is returned.

ERRORS
     [EINVAL]           The ACL type passed is invalid for this vnode.

     [EACCES]           The caller does not have the appropriate privilege.

     [ENOMEM]           Sufficient memory is not available to fulfill the
                        request.

     [EOPNOTSUPP]       The file system does not support VOP_GETACL().
