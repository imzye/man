DESCRIPTION
       The jitterentropy library provides a source of good entropy by
       collecting CPU executing time jitter. The entropy in the CPU execution
       time jitter is magnified by the CPU Jitter Random Number Generator.
       The CPU Jitter Random Number Generator uses the CPU execution timing
       jitter to generate a bit stream which complies with different
       statistical measurements that determine the bit stream is random.

       The CPU Jitter Random Number Generator delivers entropy which follows
       information theoretical requirements. Based on these studies and the
       implementation, the caller can assume that one bit of data extracted
       from the CPU Jitter Random Number Generator holds one bit of entropy.

       The CPU Jitter Random Number Generator provides a decentralized source
       of entropy where the caller does not need to rely on a centrally
       maintained source of entropy like /dev/random or /dev/urandom.

       jent_entropy_switch_notime_impl() allows the caller to set a thread
       handler that is used by the Jitter RNG if it operates in the timer-less
       mode. See jitterentropy.h for a documentation of new_thread.  This
       function must be called before jent_entropy_init() as after this call,
       the change of the thread handler is denied.

       jent_set_fips_failure_callback() allows the caller to set a callback
       that is invoked by the Jitter RNG when a health test failure is
       detected. The callback specified with the parameter cb to the API
       function receives the Jitter RNG state with the parameter ec and the
       FIPS health test failure with the parameter health_failure.  his
       function must be called before jent_entropy_init() as after this call,
       the change of the callback is denied.

       jent_entropy_init() initializes the CPU Jitter Random Number Generator.
       The function performs statistical tests to verify that the underlying
       system offers the properties needed for measuring and collecting
       entropy.  If the initialization is successful, which implies that the
       statistical tests indicate the underlying system is appropriate, the
       call returns with 0.  A return code other than 0 indicates a failure
       where the calling application MUST NOT use the CPU Jitter Random Number
       Generator.

       jent_entropy_init_ex() behaves identically to jent_entropy_init()
       except that it allows the caller to provide the osr and flags
       parameters which should be identical to the subsequent invocation of
       jent_entropy_collector_alloc().  When specifying an oversampling rate
       osr different than the default, the startup test honor this value and
       adjust the self-test cut-off thresholds to the same values as used at
       runtime.

       jent_entropy_collector_alloc() allocates a CPU Jitter entropy collector
       instance and returns the handle to the caller. If the allocation fails,
       including memory constraints, the call returns NULL.  The function
       requires two arguments, the oversampling rate osr and a set of flags
       with flags.  The osr value defines the amount of oversampling performed
       by the entropy collector. Usually, a caller wants to provide the value
       0 here to apply the default oversampling. The call ensures that any
       value lower than JENT_MIN_OSR is converted to JENT_MIN_OSR
       automatically.

       The flags value is either zero or one or more of the following flags.

       JENT_DISABLE_MEMORY_ACCESS
              If the system is constrained with memory, this flag disables the
              allocation of that memory and therefore memory accesses. But
              that also implies that the entropy collection process only
              relies on the complexity of the CPU. Note, if somebody knows all
              details of that CPU complexity, that person may potentially
              reduce the entropy delivered by the CPU complexity. If that
              person can push the generated entropy below a threshold, the CPU
              Jitter random number generator starts overestimating entropy
              from the noise source. Thus, disabling memory accesses and
              relying only on the CPU complexity should only be done if you
              really know what you are doing.

       JENT_FORCE_INTERNAL_TIMER
              This flag can be used to force the Jitter RNG to use the
              internal high-resolution timer instead of using the hardware
              time stamp. Commonly, the startup self test performed with
              jent_entropy_init() uses the hardware timer with precedence if
              it is identified to be appropriate for entropy collection. If
              the internal timer is not compiled, requesting this flag returns
              an error. Even though a separate thread is spawned to provide a
              high-resolution time stamp, this entire operation is completely
              thread-safe as all relevant data is maintained as part of the
              entropy_collector data structure.

       JENT_DISABLE_INTERNAL_TIMER
              This flag can be used to ensure that the internal timer is not
              used.  If this flag is used together with
              JENT_FORCE_INTERNAL_TIMER this is treated as an error and the
              allocation returns NULL. Also, in case jent_entropy_init()
              detects that the internal timer shall be used but the disable
              flag is set, the allocation returns NULL.

       JENT_FORCE_FIPS
              Force full FIPS 140 and SP800-90B compliance irrespective of the
              FIPS setting of the underlying operating system.

       JENT_MAX_MEMSIZE_*
              Define the maximum amount of memory that the Jitter RNG will use
              for its operation supporting the collection of raw noise.
              Without using one of these flags, the Jitter RNG uses a built-in
              limit.  The larger the amount of memory is the more entropy is
              collected.  Yet, the default value is safe on most CPUs. If you
              have memory pressure but the entropy rate of your CPU is
              sufficient a lower memory size may be used. Contrary when having
              sufficient memory but insufficient entropy, larger memory sizes
              may be specified.  In any case, the Jitter RNG uses at most as
              much memory as the sum of the CPU's data caches.

       jent_entropy_collector_free() zeroizes and frees the given CPU Jitter
       entropy collector instance.

       jent_read_entropy() generates a random bit stream and returns it to the
       caller.  entropy_collector is the CPU Jitter entropy collector instance
       which shall be used to obtain random numbers.  data is the destination
       memory location where the random bit stream is written to. The memory
       must have already been allocated by the caller.  len is a length value
       provided by the caller indicating the number of bytes the CPU Jitter
       Random Number Generator shall generate.  The caller can provide any
       value greater than 0. The caller must ensure that data is at least als
       big as len indicates. The function returns the number of bytes
       generated when the request is successfully completed. If the function
       returns the error code -1 then the caller handed in a non-initialized
       (i.e. NULL value) for the entropy collector. The return code of -2
       indicates the SP800-90B repetition count online health test failed.
       The error code of -3 specifies that the SP800-90B adaptive proportion
       online health test failed.  -4 marks that the internal timer generator
       cannot be initialized.  -5 specifies that the LAG predictor health test
       failed.  -6 indicates that the Repetitive Count Test (RCT) failed
       permanently.  -7 indicates that the Adaptive Proportion Test (APT)
       failed permanently.  -8 indicates that the LAG prediction test failed
       permanently.

       When either online health test fails the Jitter RNG will not have any
       data provided in data.  The entropy collector instance will remain in
       error state. To recover, the entropy collector instance MUST be
       deallocated and a fresh instance must be allocated. It is recommended
       that you increase the osr value at least by one when newly allocating
       the Jitter RNG with jent_entropy_collector_alloc() which implies that
       the health tests are less sensitive due to the fact that the assumed
       entropy rate of the noise source is lower.

       jent_read_entropy_safe() is a service function to and therefore
       operates identically to jent_read_entropy() with the exception that it
       automatically re-allocates the entropy collector if a health test
       failure is observed. Before reallocation, a new power-on health test is
       performed. The allocation of the new entropy collector automatically
       increases the OSR by one. This is done based on the idea that a health
       test failure indicates that the assumed entropy rate is too high.

       Note the function returns with an health test error if the OSR is
       getting too large. If an error is returned by this function, the Jitter
       RNG is not safe to be used on the current system.

       The function jent_read_entropy_safe() has the same error codes as
       jent_read_entropy().

       JENT_MAJVERSION indicates API / ABI incompatible changes, functional
       changes that require consumer to be updated.

       JENT_MINVERSION indicates API compatible, ABI may change, functional
       enhancements only, consumer can be left unchanged if enhancements are
       not considered.

       JENT_PATCHLEVEL indicates API / ABI compatible, no functional changes,
       no enhancements, bug fixes only. Also, the entropy collection is not
       changed in any way that would necessitate a re-assessment.

       JENT_VERSION the version number of the library as an integer value that
       is monotonically increasing. The version numbers are multiples of 100.
       For example, version 1.2.3 is converted to 1020300 -- the last two
       digits are reserved for future use.

       jent_version() returns JENT_VERSION.

FIPS 140-3 Considerations
       In order for the Jitter RNG to execute compliant to FIPS 140-3 and by
       extension also SP800-90B and SP800-90C compliant, the following
       considerations must be applied:

       Enable FIPS mode
              The FIPS mode is enabled by using the JENT_FORCE_FIPS flag
              during initialization of the Jitter RNG library. On Linux, the
              the FIPS mode is transparently enabled if the entire operating
              system was booted in FIPS mode, usually by using the "fips=1"
              Linux kernel command line parameter.

       Perform heursitic entropy analysis
              The test tool set provided as part of the Jitter RNG library
              source distribution contains the helper to obtain raw noise data
              at runtime as well as at initialization time to calculate the
              SP800-90B entropy rate.  This rate must be above 0.333, the
              implied heuristic minimum by the Jitter RNG library.

       Resolve insufficient entropy
              If insufficient entropy is found during the aforementioned
              SP800-90B analysis, the test tool set provides a helper to
              analyze optimal settings - see the test tool set for raw entropy
              for details. The resulting configuration values are expected to
              be used with the flags parameter of the calls
              jent_entropy_collector_alloc() and jent_entropy_init_ex().  It
              is recommended that the function jent_read_entropy_safe() API
              call is used for generating random numbers.

NOTES
       In addition to use the generated random bit stream directly for
       cryptographic operations, the output of jent_read_entropy() can be used
       for seeding a deterministic random number generator.
