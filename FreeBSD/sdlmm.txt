SDLmm(3)               FreeBSD Library Functions Manual               SDLmm(3)

NAME
       SDLmm - The namespace for the SDLmm library.

SYNOPSIS
   Compounds
       class SDLmm::Audio
       class SDLmm::BaseSurface
           An abstract base class for graphical surfaces.
       class SDLmm::CD
       class SDLmm::ColorRGB
           A small usefull class representing an RGB color.
       class SDLmm::ColorRGBA
           A small usefull class representing an RGBA color.
       class SDLmm::Display
           The video frame buffer surface.
       class SDLmm::Event
           The general Event class.
       class SDLmm::EventHandler
           The base class used for custom Event handlers.
       class SDLmm::Joystick
       class SDLmm::PixelFormat
       class SDLmm::SPoint
           A small usefull class representing a point in 2 dimensional space.
       class SDLmm::SRect
           This enhanced version of SDL_Rect includes a number of handy
           short-hand constructors. Since the class is derived from the
           SDL_Rect struct, it can be used in any context where an SDL_Rect is
           valid.
       class SDLmm::Surface
           A graphical surface structure which is used to store graphical
           data.
       class SDLmm::Timer
       class SDLmm::VideoInfo
           Video target information.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
       The namespace for the SDLmm library.

TYPEDEF DOCUMENTATION
   typedef Uint32 SDLmm::Color

FUNCTION DOCUMENTATION
   const char * SDLmm::GetError ()
       Get the latest error message.

       Returns:
           The error message for the last SDL function that failed.

   bool SDLmm::Init (Uint32 flags)
       Initializes SDL.

       This method should be called before utilizing any other SDL or SDLmm
       functionality. The flags parameter specifies what part(s) of SDL to
       initialize (see the SDL documentation for details).

       Parameters:

       flags  the subsystems to initalize

       Returns:
           true on success, false on error

       Note:
           In SDLmm the preferred way of initiating subsystem is to use the
           Init() function in the subsystem classes. I.e to initialize audio
           and video, run Display::Init() and Audio::Init(). Also note that
           instantiating an object might be enough (for example creating a
           VideoInfo instance will initialize the video subsystem).

   void SDLmm::Quit ()
       Shut down SDL.

       Quit() shuts down all SDL subsystems and frees the resources allocated
       to them. This should always be called before you exit. For the sake of
       simplicity you can set Quit() as your atexit call, like this:

           SDLmm::Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO|SDL_INIT_AUDIO);
           atexit(SDLmm::Quit);


   Uint32 SDLmm::WasInit (Uint32 flags)
       Check which subsystems are initialized.

       This allows you to see which SDL subsytems have been initialized.

       Parameters:

       flags  bitwise OR'd combination of the subsystems you wish to check

       Returns:
           A bitwised OR'd combination of the initialized subsystems.

   const char * SDLmm::version ()
       Return the SDLmm library version.
