zzcat(1)                FreeBSD General Commands Manual               zzcat(1)

NAME
       zzcat - concatenate files using different instruction sequences

SYNOPSIS
       zzcat [-AbdeEntTv] [-r loops] [-x sequence] [FILE]...
       zzcat -l | --list
       zzcat -h | --help
       zzcat -V | --version

DESCRIPTION
       The zzcat utility reads files sequentially, writing them to the
       standard output. The user can decide which sequence of library calls is
       used to seek and read data.

       zzcat is primarily used as a debugging tool for zzuf, because it can
       emulate different programs' ways to read files.

OPTIONS
       -A, --show-all
              Equivalent to -vET.

       -b, --number-nonblank
              Number nonempty output lines.

       -d, --debug
              Output debugging information.

       -e     Equivalent to -vET.

       -E, --show-ends
              Display $ at end of each line.

       -n, --number
              Number all output lines.

       -r, --repeat=loops
              Concatenate all files loops times.

       -t     Equivalent to -vT.

       -T, --show-tabs
              Display TAB characters as ^I.

       -v, --show-nonprinting
              Use ^ and M- notation, except for LFD and TAB.

       -x, --execute=sequence
              Read a file or a stream using the instruction sequence specified
              in sequence.

              Instructions are executed sequentially until the end of the
              program.  End-of-file is not an exit condition, except where the
              feof keyword is used:

                  fread(1,10); feof(1); fread(1,10)

              Loops are permitted using the repeat keyword. Again, feof can be
              used to prematurely break out of a loop:

                  repeat(10000, fgetc() feof(1))

              Instructions can be separated by spaces, commas or semicolons.
              A list of all available instructions and control keywords can be
              obtained using this command:

                  zzcat -l

              If no sequence is specified, the following default sequence is
              used:

                  repeat(-1, fread(1,32768), feof(1))


       -l, --list
              Display the list of supported keywords and functions and exit.

       -h, --help
              Display a short help message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Output version information and exit.

EXAMPLES
       Read the first 1000 bytes of f, then exit:

           zzcat -x 'fread(1,1000)' f

       Read the first four bytes of f, using four different instructions:

           zzcat -x 'getc(),fgetc(),getc_unlocked(),_IO_getc()' f

       Read f entirely, by calling getc() repeatedly until end-of-file is
       reached:

           zzcat -x 'repeat(-1, getc(), feof(1))' f

       Read f entirely, in chunks of 32768 bytes until end-of-file is reached:

           zzcat -x 'repeat(-1, fread(1,32768), feof(1))' f
