Danga::Socket::Callback(3)                 User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Danga::Socket::Callback - Use Danga::Socket From Callbacks

SYNOPSIS
         my $danga = Danga::Socket::Callback->new(
           handle         => $socket,
           context        => { ... },
           on_read_ready  => sub { ... },
           on_write_ready => sub { ... },
           on_error       => sub { ... },
           on_signal_hup  => sub { ... },
         );

         Danga::Socket->EventLoop();

DESCRIPTION
       Love the fact that Perlbal, Mogilefs, and friends all run fast because
       of Danga::Socket, but despise it because you need to subclass it every
       time?  Well, here's a module for all you lazy people.

       Danga::Socket::Callback is a thin wrapper arond Danga::Socket that
       allows you to set callbacks to be called at various events. This allows
       you to define multiple Danga::Socket-based sockets without defining
       multiple classes:

         my $first = Danga::Socket::Callback->new(
           hadle => $sock1,
           on_read_ready => \&sub1
         );

         my $second = Danga::Socket::Callback->new(
           hadle => $sock2,
           on_read_ready => \&sub2
         );

         Danga::Socket->EventLoop();

METHODS
   new
       Creates a new instance of Danga::Socket::Callback. Takes the following
       parameters:

       handle
           The socket/handle to read from.

       context
           Arbitrary data to be shared between your app and
           Danga::Socket::Callback.

       on_read_ready
           Specify the code reference to be fired when the socket is ready to
           be read

       on_write_ready
           Specify the code reference to be fired when the socket is ready to
           be written

       on_error
           Specify te code reference to be fired when there was an error

       on_signal_hup
           Specify the code reference to be fired when a HUP signal is
           received.

   event_read
   event_write
   event_err
   event_hup
       Implements each method available from Danga::Socket. If the
       corresponding callbacks are available, then calls the callback. Each
       callback receives the Danga::Socket::Callback object.

       For event_write, if no callback is available, then the default
       event_write method from Danga::Socket is called.

BUGS
       Possibly. I don't claim to use 100% of Danga::Socket. If you find any,
       please report them (preferrably with a failing test case)
