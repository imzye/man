NAME
       Math::Interpolate - Interpolate the value Y from X using a list of (X,
       Y) pairs

SYNOPSIS
        use Math::Interpolate qw(derivatives constant_interpolate
                                 linear_interpolate robust_interpolate);
        my @x = (1..5);
        my @y = (5, 10, 13, -4.5, 3);
        my @dy = derivatives(\@x, \@y);
        my ($l_y, $l_dy) = linear_interpolate(3.4, \@x, \@y);
        my ($r_y, $r_dy) = robust_interpolate(3.4, \@x, \@y);
        ($r_y, $r_dy) = robust_interpolate(3.4, \@x, \@y, [-2, 3, 4, -1, 4]);

DESCRIPTION
SUBROUTINES
       derivatives x_sequence y_sequence
           Given a reference to an array of x values in x_sequence and a
           reference to an array of y values in y_sequence, return an array of
           reasonable derivatives.  The x_sequence values are presumed to be
           sorted in increasing numerical order.

           If there is an error in the input, such as x_sequence and
           y_sequence containing a different number of elements, then the
           subroutine returns an empty list in list context, an undefined
           value in scalar context, or nothing in a void context.

       constant_interpolate x x_sequence y_sequence
           Given a reference to an array of x values in x_sequence and a
           reference to an array of y values in y_sequence, return the y value
           associated with the first x value less than or equal to x.  In
           other words, if
              x_sequence->[i] <= x < x_sequence->[i+1]

           then return
              y_sequence->[i]

           If x is less than x_sequence->[0], then return y_sequence->[0].  If
           x is greater than x_sequence-[-1], then return y_sequence->[-1].

           If there is an error in the input, such as x_sequence and
           y_sequence containing a different number of elements, then the
           subroutine returns an empty list in list context, an undefined
           value in scalar context, or nothing in a void context.

       linear_interpolate x x_sequence y_sequence
           Given a reference to an array of x values in x_sequence and a
           reference to an array of y values in y_sequence, calculate the
           interpolated value y that corresponds to the value x.  The returned
           value y lies on the straight line between the two points
           surrounding x.  If <x> lies outside of the range of values spanned
           by x_sequence then a linear extrapolation will be done.

           In an array context, linear_interpolate will return an array
           containing the y value and and slope between the two nearest
           surrounding points.

           If there is an error in the input, such as x_sequence and
           y_sequence containing a different number of elements, then the
           subroutine returns an empty list in list context, an undefined
           value in scalar context, or nothing in a void context.

       robust_interpolate value x_sequence y_sequence [dy_sequence]
           Given a reference to an array of x values in x_sequence and a
           reference to an array of y values in y_sequence, calculate the
           interpolated value y that corresponds to the value x.  The
           interpolated curve generated by robust_interpolate is smooth and
           even the derivatives of the curve are smooth with only a few
           exceptions.

           The returned value y lies on the curve between the two points
           surrounding x.  If <x> lies outside of the range of values spanned
           by x_sequence then a linear extrapolation will be done.

           In an array context, linear_interpolate will return an array
           containing the y value and and slope between the two nearest
           surrounding points.

           If there is an error in the input, such as x_sequence and
           y_sequence containing a different number of elements, then the
           subroutine returns an empty list in list context, an undefined
           value in scalar context, or nothing in a void context.
