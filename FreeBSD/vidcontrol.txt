NAME
     vidcontrol – system console control and configuration utility

SYNOPSIS
     vidcontrol [-CdLHPpx] [-b color] [-c appearance] [-f [[size] file]]
                [-g geometry] [-h size] [-i active | adapter | mode]
                [-l screen_map] [-M char] [-m on | off]
                [-r foreground background] [-S on | off] [-s number]
                [-T xterm | cons25] [-t N | off] [mode]
                [foreground [background]] [show]

DESCRIPTION
     The vidcontrol utility is used to set various options for the syscons(4)
     or vt(4) console driver, such as video mode, colors, cursor shape, screen
     output map, font and screen saver timeout.  Only a small subset of
     options is supported by vt(4).  Unsupported options lead to error
     messages, typically including the text "Inappropriate ioctl for device".

     The following command line options are supported:

     mode    Select a new video mode.  The modes currently recognized are:
             80x25, 80x30, 80x43, 80x50, 80x60, 132x25, 132x30, 132x43,
             132x50, 132x60, VGA_40x25, VGA_80x25, VGA_80x30, VGA_80x50,
             VGA_80x60, VGA_90x25, VGA_90x30, VGA_90x43, VGA_90x50, VGA_90x60,
             EGA_80x25, EGA_80x43, VESA_132x25, VESA_132x43, VESA_132x50,
             VESA_132x60.  The raster text mode VESA_800x600 can also be
             chosen.  Alternatively, a mode can be specified with its number
             by using a mode name of the form MODE_⟨NUMBER⟩.  A list of valid
             mode numbers can be obtained with the -i mode option.  See Video
             Mode Support below.

     foreground [background]
             Change colors when displaying text.  Specify the foreground color
             (e.g. “vidcontrol white”), or both a foreground and background
             colors (e.g. “vidcontrol yellow blue”).  Use the show command
             below to see available colors.

     show    See the supported colors on a given platform.

     -b color
             Set border color to color.  This option may not be always
             supported by the video driver.

     -C      Clear the history buffer.

     -c setting[,setting ...]
             Change the cursor appearance.  The change is specified by a non-
             empty comma-separated list of settings.  Each setting overrides
             or modifies previous ones in left to right order.

             The following override settings are available:

             normal  Set to a block covering 1 character cell, with a
                     configuration-dependent coloring that should be at worst
                     inverse video.

             destructive
                     Set to a blinking sub-block with height scanlines
                     starting at base.  The name “destructive” is bad for
                     backwards compatibility.  This setting should not force
                     destructiveness, and it now only gives destructiveness in
                     some configurations (typically for hardware cursors in
                     text mode).  Blinking limits destructiveness.  This
                     setting should now be spelled normal,blink,noblock.  A
                     non-blinking destructive cursor would be unusable, so old
                     versions of vidcontrol didn't support it, and this
                     version doesn't have an override for it.

             base=value, height=value
                     Set the specified scanline parameters.  These parameters
                     are only active in noblock mode.  value is an integer in
                     any base supported by strtol(3).  Setting height to 0
                     turns off the cursor in noblock mode.  Negative values
                     are silently ignored.  Positive values are clamped to fit
                     in the character cell when the cursor is drawn.

             The following modifier settings are available:

             blink, noblink
                     Set or clear the blinking attribute.  This is not quite
                     backwards compatible.  In old versions of vidcontrol,
                     blink was an override to a blinking block.

             block, noblock
                     Set or clear the block attribute.  This attribute is the
                     inverse of the flag CONS_CHAR_CURSOR in the
                     implementation.  It deactivates the scanline parameters,
                     and expresses a preference for using a simpler method of
                     implementation.  Its inverse does the opposite.  When the
                     scanline parameters give a full block, this attribute
                     reduces to a method selection bit.  The block method
                     tends to give better coloring.

             hidden, nohidden
                     Set or clear the hidden attribute.

             The following (non-sticky) flags control application of the
             settings:

             charcolors
                     Apply base and height to the (character) cursor's list of
                     preferred colors instead of its shape.  Beware that the
                     color numbers are raw VGA palette indexes, not ANSI color
                     numbers.  The indexes are reduced mod 8, 16 or 256, or
                     ignored, depending on the video mode and renderer.

             mousecolors
                     Colors for the mouse cursor in graphics mode.  Like
                     charcolors, except there is no preference or sequence;
                     base gives the mouse border color and height gives the
                     mouse interior color.  Together with charcolors, this
                     gives 2 selection bits which select between only 3 of 4
                     sub-destinations of the 4 destinations selected by
                     default and local (by ignoring mousecolors if charcolors
                     is also set).

             default
                     Apply the changes to the default settings and then to the
                     active settings, instead of only to the active settings.
                     Together with local, this gives 2 selection bits which
                     select between 4 destinations.

             shapeonly
                     Ignore any changes to the block and hidden attributes.

             local   Apply the changes to the current vty.  The default is to
                     apply them to a global place and copy from there to all
                     vtys.

             reset   Reset everything.  The default is to not reset.  When the
                     local parameter is specified, the current local settings
                     are reset to default local settings.  Otherwise, the
                     current global settings are reset to default global
                     settings and then copied to the current and default
                     settings for all vtys.

             show    Show the current changes.

     -d      Print out current output screen map.

     -f [[size] file]
             Load font file for size (currently, only 8x8, 8x14 or 8x16).  The
             font file can be either uuencoded or in raw binary format.  You
             can also use the menu-driven vidfont(1) command to load the font
             of your choice.

             Size may be omitted, in this case vidcontrol will try to guess it
             from the size of font file.

             When using vt(4) both size and font can be omitted, and the
             default font will be loaded.

             Note that older video cards, such as MDA and CGA, do not support
             software font.  See also Video Mode Support and EXAMPLES below
             and the man page for either syscons(4) or vt(4) (depending on
             which driver you use).

     -g geometry
             Set the geometry of the text mode for the modes with selectable
             geometry.  Currently only raster modes, such as VESA_800x600,
             support this option.  See also Video Mode Support and EXAMPLES
             below.

     -h size
             Set the size of the history (scrollback) buffer to size lines.

     -i active
             Shows the active vty number.

     -i adapter
             Shows info about the current video adapter.

     -i mode
             Shows the possible video modes with the current video hardware.

     -l screen_map
             Install screen output map file from screen_map.  See also
             syscons(4) or vt(4) (depending on which driver you use).

     -L      Install default screen output map.

     -M char
             Sets the base character used to render the mouse pointer to char.

     -m on | off
             Switch the mouse pointer on or off.  Used together with the
             moused(8) daemon for text mode cut & paste functionality.

     -p      Capture the current contents of the video buffer corresponding to
             the terminal device referred to by standard input.  The
             vidcontrol utility writes contents of the video buffer to the
             standard output in a raw binary format.  For details about that
             format see Format of Video Buffer Dump below.

     -P      Same as -p, but dump contents of the video buffer in a plain text
             format ignoring nonprintable characters and information about
             text attributes.

     -H      When used with -p or -P, it instructs vidcontrol to dump full
             history buffer instead of visible portion of the video buffer
             only.

     -r foreground background
             Change reverse mode colors to foreground and background.

     -S on | off
             Turn vty switching on or off.  When vty switching is off,
             attempts to switch to a different virtual terminal will fail.
             (The default is to permit vty switching.)  This protection can be
             easily bypassed when the kernel is compiled with the DDB option.
             However, you probably should not compile the kernel debugger on a
             box which is supposed to be physically secure.

     -s number
             Set the active vty to number.

     -T xterm | cons25
             Switch between xterm and cons25 style terminal emulation.

     -t N | off
             Set the screensaver timeout to N seconds, or turns it off.

     -x      Use hexadecimal digits for output.

   Video Mode Support
     Note that not all modes listed above may be supported by the video
     hardware.  You can verify which mode is supported by the video hardware,
     using the -i mode option.

     The VESA BIOS support must be linked to the kernel or loaded as a KLD
     module if you wish to use VESA video modes or 132 column modes (see
     vga(4)).

     You need to compile your kernel with the VGA_WIDTH90 option if you wish
     to use VGA 90 column modes (see vga(4)).

     Video modes other than 25 and 30 line modes may require specific size of
     font.  Use -f option above to load a font file to the kernel.  If the
     required size of font has not been loaded to the kernel, vidcontrol will
     fail if the user attempts to set a new video mode.

     Modes            Font size
     25 line modes    8x16 (VGA), 8x14 (EGA)
     30 line modes    8x16
     43 line modes    8x8
     50 line modes    8x8
     60 line modes    8x8

     It is better to always load all three sizes (8x8, 8x14 and 8x16) of the
     same font.

     You may set variables in /etc/rc.conf or /etc/rc.conf.local so that
     desired font files will be automatically loaded when the system starts
     up.  See below.

     If you want to use any of the raster text modes you need to recompile
     your kernel with the SC_PIXEL_MODE option.  See syscons(4) or vt(4)
     (depending on which driver you use) for more details on this kernel
     option.

   Format of Video Buffer Dump
     The vidcontrol utility uses the syscons(4) or vt(4) CONS_SCRSHOT ioctl(2)
     to capture the current contents of the video buffer.  The vidcontrol
     utility writes version and additional information to the standard output,
     followed by the contents of the video buffer.

     VGA video memory is typically arranged in two byte tuples, one per
     character position.  In each tuple, the first byte will be the character
     code, and the second byte is the character's color attribute.

     The VGA color attribute byte looks like this:

     bits#                width    meaning
     7      <X0000000>    1        character blinking
     6:4    <0XXX0000>    3        background color
     3      <0000X000>    1        bright foreground color
     2:0    <00000XXX>    3        foreground color

     Here is a list of the three bit wide base colors:

           0       Black
           1       Blue
           2       Green
           3       Cyan
           4       Red
           5       Magenta
           6       Brown
           7       Light Grey

     Base colors with bit 3 (the bright foreground flag) set:

           0       Dark Grey
           1       Light Blue
           2       Light Green
           3       Light Cyan
           4       Light Red
           5       Light Magenta
           6       Yellow
           7       White

     For example, the two bytes

           65 158

     specify an uppercase A (character code 65), blinking (bit 7 set) in
     yellow (bits 3:0) on a blue background (bits 6:4).

     The vidcontrol output contains a small header which includes additional
     information which may be useful to utilities processing the output.

     The first 10 bytes are always arranged as follows:

           Byte Range    Contents
           1 thru 8      Literal text “SCRSHOT_”
           9             File format version number
           10            Remaining number of bytes in the header

     Subsequent bytes depend on the version number.

           Version    Byte         Meaning
           1          11           Terminal width, in characters
                      12           Terminal depth, in characters
                      13 and up    The snapshot data

     So a dump of an 80x25 screen would start (in hex)

           53 43 52 53 48 4f 54 5f 01 02 50 19
           ----------------------- -- -- -- --
                     |              |  |  |  ` 25 decimal
                     |              |  |  `--- 80 decimal
                     |              |  `------ 2 remaining bytes of header data

                     `------------------------ Literal "SCRSHOT_"

VIDEO OUTPUT CONFIGURATION
   Boot Time Configuration
     You may set the following variables in /etc/rc.conf or /etc/rc.conf.local
     in order to configure the video output at boot time.

     blanktime    Sets the timeout value for the -t option.
     font8x16, font8x14, font8x8
                  Specifies font files for the -f option.
     scrnmap      Specifies a screen output map file for the -l option.

     See rc.conf(5) for more details.

   Driver Configuration
     The video card driver may let you change default configuration options,
     such as the default font, so that you do not need to set up the options
     at boot time.  See video card driver manuals, (e.g. vga(4)) for details.

FILES
     /usr/share/syscons/fonts/*
     /usr/share/vt/fonts/*                font files.
     /usr/share/syscons/scrnmaps/*        screen output map files (relevant
                                          for syscons(4) only).

EXAMPLES
     If you want to load /usr/share/syscons/fonts/iso-8x16.fnt to the kernel,
     run vidcontrol as:

           vidcontrol -f 8x16 /usr/share/syscons/fonts/iso-8x16.fnt

     So long as the font file is in /usr/share/syscons/fonts (if using
     syscons) or /usr/share/vt/fonts (if using vt), you may abbreviate the
     file name as iso-8x16:

           vidcontrol -f 8x16 iso-8x16

     Furthermore, you can also omit font size “8x16”:

           vidcontrol -f iso-8x16

     Moreover, the suffix specifying the font size can be also omitted; in
     this case, vidcontrol will use the size of the currently displayed font
     to construct the suffix:

           vidcontrol -f iso

     Likewise, you can also abbreviate the screen output map file name for the
     -l option if the file is found in /usr/share/syscons/scrnmaps.

           vidcontrol -l iso-8859-1_to_cp437

     The above command will load
     /usr/share/syscons/scrnmaps/iso-8859-1_to_cp437.scm.

     The following command will set-up a 100x37 raster text mode (useful for
     some LCD models):

           vidcontrol -g 100x37 VESA_800x600

     The following command will capture the contents of the first virtual
     terminal video buffer, and redirect the output to the shot.scr file:

           vidcontrol -p < /dev/ttyv0 > shot.scr

     The following command will dump contents of the fourth virtual terminal
     video buffer to the standard output in the human readable format:

           vidcontrol -P < /dev/ttyv3
