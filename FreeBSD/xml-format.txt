NAME
       XML-FORMAT - XML beautifier




SYNOPSIS
       xml-format filename



DESCRIPTION
       xml-format is an XML beautifier that indents and formats XML files for
       consistent line length.

       As with all file beautifiers, its primary purpose is to take a document
       created by someone with a perplexing lack of self-discipline and
       aesthetic sensibility and make it readable.

       The XML file is modified in place, and the original document is saved
       to filename.bak, in case you don't like the results.

       Since XML is a class of markup languages, not a markup language, the
       type of each tag encountered is determined from the type of XML file
       (DocBook, XHTML, etc.), which, in turn, is inferred from the filename
       extension (".dbk" for DocBook, ".xhtml" for XHTML, etc.)

       There are four types of tags:

       Block tags denote blocks of content that should be visually separated
       from others in the XML source, and often require multiple lines, such
       as paragraphs, captions, and programlistings.  Blocks are separated
       from other content by a blank line.  Content within a block is indented
       the same as the block tags.

           <para>
           The large forest planet Oglaroon is home to the Oglaroonians,
           an "intelligent" species who maintain an entire civilisation,
           including some extremely small wars, in one small nut tree,
           believing it to be the entire universe, and other trees to be
           merely Oglanut-induced illusions.
           </para>

       Line tags denote small but important content items that should be
       highlighted, but not necessarily use multiple lines, such as titles and
       index terms.  xml-format attempts to keep line tag items to a single,
       separate line line.

           <title>So Long, and Thanks for all the Fish</title>

       Sectioning tags denote structural components of a document, such as
       chapters, sections, figures, and lists.  Opening and closing sectioning
       tags are placed alone on separate lines.  Content between sectioning
       tags is indented one more level beyond the tags themselves.

       <chapter>
           <title>Construction of Earth</title>

           <para>
           For a time in the distant past, fjords were fashionable...
           </para>
       </chapter>

       All other tags that do not fall into the first three categories are
       considered in-line, and are treated essentially as text, except that
       they are nestled against the text they surround.

           People were described as daring <emphasis>to boldly split
           infinitives that no man had split before</emphasis>. However,

       The type of each tag is determined from simple text files containing
       lists of each tag name, on per line, in
       DATADIR/Config/language/<type>-tags.txt.

       For example, the tags for DocBook XML are found in:

       DATADIR/Config/dbk/block-tags.txt
       DATADIR/Config/dbk/line-tags.txt
       DATADIR/Config/dbk/sectioning-tags.txt


FILES
       DATADIR/Config/*/*.txt
