POE::Session::Irssi(3)                     User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       POE::Session::Irssi - emit POE events for Irssi signals

SYNOPSIS
         use Irssi;
         use Glib;
         use POE qw(Loop::Glib);
         use POE::Session::Irssi;

         %IRSSI = ( ... fill in the usual stuff for scripts here ... );

         POE::Session::Irssi->create (
             irssi_commands => {
                 hello => sub {
                   my $args = $_[ARG1];
                   my ($data, $server, $witem) = @$args;

                   $server->command("MSG $witem->{name} Hello $data!");
                 },
               },
             irssi_signals => {
                 "message join" => sub {
                   my $args = $_[ARG1];
                   my ($server, $channel, $nick, $address) = @$args;
                   my $me = $server->{nick};

                   if ($nick eq $me) {
                     $server->command("MSG $channel Hello World!");
                   } else {
                     $server->command("MSG $channel Hi there, $nick");
                   }
                 },
               },
             # Other create() args here..
         );

DESCRIPTION
       This POE::Session subclass helps you integrate POE and Irssi scripting.
       It connects the signals and commands handlers you define as POE events
       with the Irssi machinery. It also tries to clean up as much as possible
       when the script gets unloaded, by removing all the alarms your session
       has running.

       It does this cleaning up by installing an UNLOAD handler that will send
       an unload signal. See SIGNALS below for more information.

CONSTRUCTOR
   create (%args)
       Apart from the normal arguments POE::Session create() supports, there
       are two more arguments.

       • irssi_commands

           irssi_commands => {
               command_name => \&handler_sub,
           }

         As you can see in the example above, this expects a hashref, with the
         keys holding the /command you use in Irssi, and the values being
         references to the handler function. Because POE::Session::Irssi
         creates a postback behind the scenes for each command, your handler
         sub will get two arguments in ARG0 and ARG1. These are the normal
         postback lists, and the arguments you would normally receive in an
         Irssi handler are in the list in ARG1.

         Currently, only this inline_state like syntax is supported. Allowing
         for object/package states is on the TODO list.

       • irssi_signals

           irssi_signals => {
               "signal name" => \&handler_sub,
           }

         This is much the same as for the irssi_commands. One thing to
         remember is that lots of Irssi signals have spaces in their names, so
         don't forget to put them inside quotes.

SIGNALS
       POE allows you to define your own signals, which are handled the same
       as system signals. See POE::Kernel for more information.
       POE::Session::Irssi defines one such signal:

   unload $package
       This signal is sent when irssi tries to unload a script. ARG1 contains
       the package name of the script that is being unloaded.
       POE::Session::Irssi also creates a handler for this signal that does
       its best to clean up for the session by removing any aliases set and
       removing the signal handler

NOTES
       Since you don't need to call POE::Kernel->run() in Irssi scripts
       (because the Glib mainloop is already running), it is no problem at all
       to have more than one Irssi script contain a POE::Session. They will
       all use the same POE::Kernel and POE::Loop.

TODO
       • Allow object/package states

       • Maybe put a list of session aliases in an Irssi setting somewhere
         This would allow discovery of what other sessions we can talk to.
