DESCRIPTION
       The original puzzle has 9 triangles per face (size = 3) and has period
       3 turning (i.e. the face or points turn in 120 degree intervals).  The
       puzzle was designed by Uwe Meffert and called the Pyraminx.  This has
       2^5*3^8*6!/2 or 75,582,720 different comibinations.

       Another puzzle Senior Pyraminx 3x3x3 exists only on paper, it has
       period 2 turning (i.e.  edges turn with 180 degree intervals) but the
       corners would fall off unless it had some tricky mechanism.  (This may
       be the same as the Master Pyraminx which has 446,965,972,992,000
       different combinations).

       Another puzzle (which was not widely distributed), the Junior Pyraminx
       (and similarly the Junior Pyraminx Star, a octahedron formed by two
       tetrahedra, this has 7!*3^6 or 3,674,160 different combinations), has 4
       triangles (size = 2) per face and at the time I designed this computer
       puzzle thought that it had only period 2 turning (i.e the edges
       rotate).  It turns out the puzzle has a period 4 turning (edges turn
       with 90 degree intervals) which makes it analogous to the 2x2x2 Rubik's
       cube.  This puzzle makes various non-tetrahedral shapes.  The puzzle
       contained here has no period 4 turning flexability.

       One is able to simulate Halpern's Tetrahedron or Pyraminx Tetrahedron
       (period 3 turning and sticky mode).   Also one is able to simulate one
       with variant turning (period 2 turning and sticky mode).

FEATURES
       Press "mouse-left" button to move a piece.  Release "mouse-left" button
       on a piece on the same face and in the same row (but not an adjacent
       piece or the move is ambiguous).  The pieces will then turn towards
       where the mouse button was released.

       Click "mouse-center", or press "P" or "p" keys to toggle the practice
       mode (in practice mode the record should say "practice").  One must
       double click on "mouse-center" if the puzzle is being worked on.  This
       is good for learning moves and experimenting.

       Click "mouse-right", or press "R" or "r" keys to randomize (this must
       be done first to set a new record).  One must double click on "mouse-
       right" if the puzzle is being worked on.

       Press "I" or "i" keys to increase the number of "tetras".

       Press "D" or "d" keys to decrease the number of "tetras".

       Press "O" or "o" keys to toggle the orient mode.  One has to orient the
       faces in orient mode, besides getting all the faces to be the same
       color.  To do this one has to get the lines to be oriented in the same
       direction, this only matters with center "tetras", if at all (i.e.
       those "tetras" not on a corner or edge).  This does add complexity so
       there are 2 sets of records.

       Press "2", "3", "B", or "b" keys (not the keypad 2, 3) to change modes
       to Period 2, Period 3, or Both.

       Press "Y" or "y" to toggle sticky mode (increase/decrease is disabled
       here if sticky mode is on).
       "Sticky" and "Period 2" turning allows only the edges to turn, and the
       2 center rows turn together. It is as if the middle cut of the three
       cuts did not exist.
       "Sticky" and "Period 3" turning allows only the faces to turn, it is as
       if the middle cut of the three cuts did not exist.
       Beware, the "Sticky" mode is a hack and much could be done to improve
       its look.

       "S" or "s" keys reserved for the auto-solver (unimplemented).

       Press "U" or "u" keys to undo move.

       Press "G" or "g" keys to get a saved puzzle.

       Press "W" or "w" keys to write or save a puzzle.

       Press "Q", "q", or "CTRL-C" keys to kill program.

       Use the key pad, "R" keys, or arrow keys to move without mouse clicks.
       Key pad is defined for Pyraminx as:
         /     Counterclockwise

         8 9   Up, Upper Right
         ^
       4<5>6   Left, Clockwise, Right
         v
       1 2     Lower Left, Down

       Use the shift keys to access "Period 3" turns from "Both" mode,
       otherwise it assumes "Period 2" turning.  Faces and points turn in
       "Period 3" and edges (2 points) turn in "Period 2".

       Use the control key and the left mouse button, keypad, or arrow keys to
       move the whole tetrahedron.  This is not recorded as a turn.

       The title is in the following format (non-motif version):
              xpyraminx.{2|3|both<turning modes>}:
              {1|2|3|4|5|6|7|sticky<number of "tetras" per edge>} @ (<Number
              of moves>/{<Record number of moves> <username>|"NEVER
              noaccess"|"practice"}) - <Comment>
       If there is no record of the current puzzle, it displays "NEVER
       noaccess".

OPTIONS
       -geometry {+|-}X{+|-}Y
               This option sets the initial position of the pyraminx window
               (resource name "geometry").

       -display host:dpy
               This option specifies the X server to contact.

       -[no]mono
               This option allows you to  display on a color screen as if
               monochrome (resource name "mono").

       -[no]{reverse|rv}
               This option allows you to see the pyraminx window in reverse
               video (resource name "reverse").

       -{foreground|fg} color
               This option specifies the foreground of the pyraminx window
               (resource name "foreground").

       -{background|bg} color
               This option specifies the background of the pyraminx window
               (resource name "background").

       -{border|bd} color
               This option specifies the border color of the tetras in the
               pyraminx window (resource name "borderColor").

       -face{0|1|2|3} <color>
               This option allows you to change the color of a face (resource
               name "faceColorN"). In mono-mode, color is represented as the
               first letter of the color name. The faces are ordered top to
               bottom and left to right.  If you has two colors that begin
               with the same letter you should have one in uppercase and one
               in lowercase to distinguish them in mono-mode. You can change
               the colors of the faces to make a stupid pyraminx (i.e. all
               White or in mono-mode all "W").  Unfortunately, it will not
               normally say its solved when its randomized.  This would be
               cheating.

       -size <int>
               This option allows you to change the number of tetras on a edge
               (resource name "size").

       -sticky This option allows you to set the sticky mode (resource name
               "sticky").

       -mode <int>
               This option allows you to set the turning mode (resource name
               "mode").

       -both   This option allows you to set the turning mode to both period 2
               and period 3 (resource name "mode" set at 4).

       -[no]orient
               This option allows you to access the orient mode (resource name
               "orient").

       -[no]practice
               This option allows you to access the practice mode (resource
               name "practice").

       -username string
               This option specifies the user name for any records made or
               else it will get your login name (resource name "userName").

SAVE FORMAT
       The format is not standard.  The reason for this is that this is simple
       to produce and the standard notation is no good for variable number of
       "tetras" and turning modes.

       Pyraminx with default colors, not randomized:
       0     B     Blue
         1     R   Red
       2     Y     Yellow
         3     G   Green

              size: 1-7 <number of triangles in the same orientation as the
              face per row>
              mode: 2-4 <period 2 turning, period 3 turning, or both (4)>
              orient: 0-1 <0 false, 1 true; if 1 then lines on "tetras" to be
              oriented>
              sticky: 0-1 <0 false, 1 true; if 1 then some "tetras" move
              together>
              practice: 0-1 <0 false, 1 true>
              moves: 0-MAXINT <total number of moves>

              startingPosition: <2 dimensional array of face "tetra" position,
              each face has size * size "tetras", if orient mode then
              orientation number follows face number: 0 up, 1 upper right, 2
              right, 3 down, 4 lower left, and 5 left>

       This is then followed by the moves, starting from 1.
              move #: <face> <position> <direction> <control>
       Each turn is with respect to a face and position.
       Position is 0 to size * size - 1.  Position 0 is the triangle furthest
       from the center, increasing clockwise.
       Direction is represented 0 up, 1 upper right, 2 right, 3 down, 4 lower
       left, 5 left, 9 clockwise, and 15 counterclockwise.
       Control is represented as 0 or 1, 1 if the whole tetrahedron is moved
       at once (here position does not matter), 0 if not.  The xpyraminx
       record keeper does not count a control move as a move, but here we do.

       Caution: the program may crash on corrupted input.
