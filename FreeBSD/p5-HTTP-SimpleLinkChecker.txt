HTTP_STATUS(1)        User Contributed Perl Documentation       HTTP_STATUS(1)


NAME
       http_status - check the HTTP status of a URL

SYNOPSIS
               % http_status URL [URL ...]

DESCRIPTION
       http_status gets the HTTP status of a URL as returned by the server. It
       actually works with more than HTTP links since it uses the "LWP" Perl
       module which treats all URLs the same.  This works too:

               % perl script/http_status file:///Users/brian/.login

       If you have "Term::ANSIColor", it will color the output. If you have
       "HTML::SimpleLinkExtor", it will parse the HTML of the resource and
       then check all of those links.

       If, for some reason, I disappear from the world, one of the other
       members of the project can shepherd this module appropriately.
