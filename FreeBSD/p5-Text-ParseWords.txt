NAME
       Text::ParseWords - parse text into an array of tokens or array of
       arrays

SYNOPSIS
         use Text::ParseWords;
         @lists = nested_quotewords($delim, $keep, @lines);
         @words = quotewords($delim, $keep, @lines);
         @words = shellwords(@lines);
         @words = parse_line($delim, $keep, $line);
         @words = old_shellwords(@lines); # DEPRECATED!

DESCRIPTION
       The nested_quotewords() and quotewords() functions accept a delimiter
       (which can be a regular expression) and a list of lines and then breaks
       those lines up into a list of words ignoring delimiters that appear
       inside quotes.  quotewords() returns all of the tokens in a single long
       list, while nested_quotewords() returns a list of token lists
       corresponding to the elements of @lines.  parse_line() does tokenizing
       on a single string.  The *quotewords() functions simply call
       parse_line(), so if you're only splitting one line you can call
       parse_line() directly and save a function call.

       The $keep controls what happens with delimters and special characters:

       true
           If true, then the tokens are split on the specified delimiter, but
           all other characters (including quotes and backslashes) are kept in
           the tokens.

       false
           If $keep is false then the *quotewords() functions remove all
           quotes and backslashes that are not themselves backslash-escaped or
           inside of single quotes (i.e., quotewords() tries to interpret
           these characters just like the Bourne shell).  NB: these semantics
           are significantly different from the original version of this
           module shipped with Perl 5.000 through 5.004.

       "delimiters"
           As an additional feature, $keep may be the keyword "delimiters"
           which causes the functions to preserve the delimiters in each
           string as tokens in the token lists, in addition to preserving
           quote and backslash characters.

       shellwords() is written as a special case of quotewords(), and it does
       token parsing with whitespace as a delimiter-- similar to most Unix
       shells.

EXAMPLES
       The sample program:

         use Text::ParseWords;
         @words = quotewords('\s+', 0, q{this   is "a test" of\ quotewords \"for you});
         $i = 0;
         foreach (@words) {
             print "$i: <$_>\n";
             $i++;
         }

       produces:

         0: <this>
         1: <is>
         2: <a test>
         3: <of quotewords>
         4: <"for>
         5: <you>

       demonstrating:

       0   a simple word

       1   multiple spaces are skipped because of our $delim

       2   use of quotes to include a space in a word

       3   use of a backslash to include a space in a word

       4   use of a backslash to remove the special meaning of a double-quote

       5   another simple word (note the lack of effect of the backslashed
           double-quote)

       Replacing "quotewords('\s+', 0, q{this   is...})" with
       "shellwords(q{this   is...})" is a simpler way to accomplish the same
       thing.

AUTHORS
       The original author is unknown, but presumably this evolved from
       "shellwords.pl" in Perl 4.

       Much of the code for parse_line() (including the primary regexp) came
       from Joerk Behrends <jbehrends@multimediaproduzenten.de>.
