DEVICE_DETACH(9)       FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual      DEVICE_DETACH(9)

NAME
     DEVICE_DETACH – detach a device

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <sys/bus.h>

     int
     DEVICE_DETACH(device_t dev);

DESCRIPTION
     Detach a device.  This can be called if the user is replacing the driver
     software or if a device is about to be physically removed from the system
     (e.g. for pccard(4) devices).

     The method should deallocate any system resources allocated during the
     DEVICE_ATTACH(9) method and reset the hardware to a sane state (i.e.,
     disable interrupts etc.)

RETURN VALUES
     Zero is returned on success, otherwise an appropriate error is returned.
