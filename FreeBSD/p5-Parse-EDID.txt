       data structure, as an hashref.

   check_parsed_edid($edid)
       Check the data structure, and return an error message if anything is
       wrong,  an empty string otherwise.

   find_edid_in_string($string)
       Extract raw binary edid data from another tool text output, such as
       xrandr --prop.
