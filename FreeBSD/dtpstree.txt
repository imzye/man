NAME
       dtpstree - display a tree of processes

SYNOPSIS
       dtpstree [options] [PID|USER]

DESCRIPTION
       dtpstree shows running processes as a tree. It is a reimplementation of
       pstree from PSmisc for FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFly BSD, and
       possibly other modern BSD variants. It also works without /proc and
       will show the full set of processes in a jail even if init is not
       present.
