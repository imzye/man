NAME
     dwarf_formexprloc – return information about a location expression

LIBRARY
     DWARF Access Library (libdwarf, -ldwarf)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <libdwarf.h>

     int
     dwarf_formexprloc(Dwarf_Attribute attr, Dwarf_Unsigned *retlen,
         Dwarf_Ptr *retexpr, Dwarf_Error *err);

DESCRIPTION
     Function dwarf_formexprloc() allows an application to retrieve the length
     and the bytes of a DWARF location expression.

     Argument attr should reference a DWARF attribute of the form
     DW_FORM_exprloc.  Argument retlen should point to a location that will be
     set to the length of the location expression.  Argument retexpr should
     point to a location that will be set to a pointer to the content of the
     location expression itself.

     If argument err is not NULL, it will be used to return an error
     descriptor in case of an error.

   Memory Management
     The application should not attempt to free the memory area referenced by
     the pointer returned in argument retexpr.

RETURN VALUES
     Function dwarf_formexprloc() returns DW_DLV_OK on success.  In case of an
     error, it returns DW_DLV_ERROR and sets argument err.

ERRORS
     Function dwarf_formexprloc() may fail with the following errors:

     [DW_DLE_ARGUMENT]            One of arguments attr, retlen or retexpr was
                                  NULL.

     [DW_DLE_ATTR_FORM_BAD]       The attribute referenced by argument attr
                                  was not of form DW_FORM_exprloc.
