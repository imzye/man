DESCRIPTION
       void is an dummy/null Xorg input driver.  It doesn't connect to any
       physical device, and it never delivers any events.  It functions as
       both a pointer and keyboard device, and may be used as X server's core
       pointer and/or core keyboard.  It's purpose is to allow X servers pre
       version 1.4 to operate without a core pointer and/or core keyboard.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for general configuration details and for
       options that can be used with all input drivers.  This driver doesn't
       have any configuration options in addition to those.
