NAME
     amdpm – AMD 756/766/768/8111 Power Management controller driver

SYNOPSIS
     device smbus
     device smb
     device amdpm

DESCRIPTION
     This driver provides access to AMD 756/766/768/8111 Power management
     controllers.  Currently, only the SMBus 1.0 controller function is
     implemented.  The SMBus 2.0 functionality of the AMD 8111 controller is
     supported via the amdsmb(4) driver.

     The embedded SMBus controller of the AMD 756 chipset may give you access
     to the monitoring facilities of your mainboard.  See smb(4) for writing
     user code to fetch voltages, temperature and so on from the monitoring
     chip of your mainboard.
