Math::SymbolicX::ParserExtensionFactory(3) User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Math::SymbolicX::ParserExtensionFactory - Generate parser extensions

SYNOPSIS
         use Math::Symbolic qw/parse_from_string/;

         # This will extend all parser objects in your program:
         use Math::SymbolicX::ParserExtensionFactory (

           functionname => sub {
             my $argumentstring = shift;
             my $result = construct_some_math_symbolic_tree( $argumentstring );
             return $result;
           },

           anotherfunction => sub {
             ...
           },

         );

         # ...
         # Later in your code

         my $formula = parse_from_string('variable * 4 * functionname(someargument)');

         # use $formula as a Math::Symbolic object.
         # Refer to Math::SymbolicX::BigNum (arbitrary precision arithmetic
         # support through the Math::Big* modules) or to
         # Math::SymbolicX::ComplexNumbers (complex number support) for examples.


         # Alternative: modify a single parser object only:
         my $parser = Math::Symbolic::Parser->new();

         Math::SymbolicX::ParserExtensionFactory->add_private_functions(
           $parser,
           fun_function => sub {...},
           my_function  => sub {...},
           ...
         );

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a simple way to extend the Math::Symbolic parser
       with arbitrary functions that return any valid Math::Symbolic tree.
       The return value of the function call is inserted into the complete
       parse tree at the point at which the function call is parsed.
       Familiarity with the Math::Symbolic module will be assumed throughout
       the documentation.

       This module is not object oriented. It does not export anything. You
       should not call any subroutines directly nor should you modify any
       class data directly. The complete interface is the call to "use
       Math::SymbolicX::ParserExtensionFactory" and its arguments. The reason
       for the long module name is that you should not have to call it
       multiple times in your code because it modifies the parser for good. It
       is intended to be a pain to type. :-)

       The aim of the module is to allow for hooks into the parser without
       modifying the parser yourself because that requires rather in-depth
       knowledge of the module code. By specifying key => value pairs of
       function names and function implementations (code references) as
       arguments to the use() call of the module, this module extends the
       parser that is stored in the $Math::Symbolic::Parser variable with the
       specified functions and whenever ""yourfunction(any argument string
       with balanced parenthesis)"" occurs in the code, the subroutine
       reference is called with the argument string as argument.

       The subroutine is expected to return any Math::Symbolic tree. That
       means, as of version 0.506 of Math::Symbolic, a
       Math::Symbolic::Operator, a Math::Symbolic::Variable, or a
       Math::Symbolic::Constant object. The returned object will be
       incorporated into the Math::Symbolic tree that results from the parse
       at the exact position at which the custom function call was parsed.

       Please note that the usage of this module will be quite slow at compile
       time because it has to regenerate the complete Math::Symbolic parser
       the first time you use this module in your code. The run time
       performance penalty should be low, however.

FUNCTIONS
   add_private_functions
       Callable as class method or function. First argument must be the parser
       object to modify (either a Parse::RecDescent or a Parse::Yapp based
       Math::Symbolic parser), followed by key/value pairs of function names
       and code refs (implementations).

       Modifies only the parser passed in as first argument. For an example,
       see synopsis above.

CAVEATS
       Since version 2.00 of this module, the old, broken parsing of the
       argument string which would fail on nested, unescaped parenthesis was
       replaced by a better routine which will correctly parse nested pairs of
       parenthesis.

       On the flip side, if the argument string contains unmatched
       parenthesis, the parse will fail. Examples:

         "myfunction(foo(bar)" # fails because missing closing parenthesis

       Escaping of parenthesis in the argument string is no longer supported.
