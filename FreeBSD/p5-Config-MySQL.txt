NAME
       Config::MySQL - Read and write MySQL-style configuration files

VERSION
       Version 0.01

DESCRIPTION
       This module extends Config::INI to support reading and writing MySQL-
       style configuration files.  Although deceptively similar to standard
       ".INI" files, they can include bare boolean options with no value
       assignment and additional features like "!include" and "!includedir".
