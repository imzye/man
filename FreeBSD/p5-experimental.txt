NAME
       experimental - Experimental features made easy

VERSION
       version 0.035

SYNOPSIS
        use experimental 'lexical_subs', 'signatures';
        my sub plus_one($value) { $value + 1 }

DESCRIPTION
       This pragma provides an easy and convenient way to enable or disable
       experimental features.

       Every version of perl has some number of features present but
       considered "experimental."  For much of the life of Perl 5, this was
       only a designation found in the documentation.  Starting in Perl
       v5.10.0, and more aggressively in v5.18.0, experimental features were
       placed behind pragmata used to enable the feature and disable
       associated warnings.

       The "experimental" pragma exists to combine the required incantations
       into a single interface stable across releases of perl.  For every
       experimental feature, this should enable the feature and silence
       warnings for the enclosing lexical scope:

         use experimental 'feature-name';

       To disable the feature and, if applicable, re-enable any warnings, use:

         no experimental 'feature-name';

       The supported features, documented further below, are:

       •   "args_array_with_signatures" - allow @_ to be used in signatured
           subs.

           This is supported on perl 5.20.0 and above, but is likely to be
           removed in the future.

       •   "array_base" - allow the use of $[ to change the starting index of
           @array.

           This was removed in perl 5.30.0.

       •   "autoderef" - allow push, each, keys, and other built-ins on
           references.

           This was added in perl 5.14.0 and removed in perl 5.24.0.

       •   "bitwise" - allow the new stringwise bit operators

           This was added in perl 5.22.0.

       •   "builtin" - allow the use of the functions in the builtin::
           namespace

           This was added in perl 5.36.0

       •   "const_attr" - allow the :const attribute on subs

           This was added in perl 5.22.0.

       •   "declared_refs" - enables aliasing via assignment to references

           This was added in perl 5.26.0.

       •   "defer" - enables the use of defer blocks

           This was added in perl 5.36.0

       •   "extra_paired_delimiters" - enables the use of more paired string
           delimiters than the traditional four, "<  >", "( )", "{ }", and
           "[ ]".

           This was added in perl 5.36.

       •   "for_list" - allows iterating over multiple values at a time with
           "for"

           This was added in perl 5.36.0

       •   "isa" - allow the use of the "isa" infix operator

           This was added in perl 5.32.0.

       •   "lexical_topic" - allow the use of lexical $_ via "my $_".

           This was added in perl 5.10.0 and removed in perl 5.24.0.

       •   "lexical_subs" - allow the use of lexical subroutines.

           This was added in 5.18.0, and became non-experimental (and always
           enabled) in 5.26.0.

       •   "postderef" - allow the use of postfix dereferencing expressions

           This was added in perl 5.20.0, and became non-experimental (and
           always enabled) in 5.24.0.

       •   "postderef_qq" - allow the use of postfix dereferencing expressions
           inside interpolating strings

           This was added in perl 5.20.0, and became non-experimental (and
           always enabled) in 5.24.0.

       •   "re_strict" - enables strict mode in regular expressions

           This was added in perl 5.22.0.

       •   "refaliasing" - allow aliasing via "\$x = \$y"

           This was added in perl 5.22.0.

       •   "regex_sets" - allow extended bracketed character classes in
           regexps

           This was added in perl 5.18.0, and became non-experimental (and
           always enabled) in 5.36.0.

           This is documented at "Extended Bracketed Character Classes" in
           perlrecharclass.

       •   "signatures" - allow subroutine signatures (for named arguments)

           This was added in perl 5.20.0.

       •   "smartmatch" - allow the use of "~~"

           This was added in perl 5.10.0, but it should be noted there are
           significant incompatibilities between 5.10.0 and 5.10.1.

           The feature was deprecated in perl 5.38.0, and undeprecated in
           5.42.0.

       •   "switch" - allow the use of "~~", given, and when

           This was added in perl 5.10.0.

           The feature was deprecated in perl 5.38.0, and undeprecated in
           5.42.0.

       •   "try" - allow the use of "try" and "catch"

           This was added in perl 5.34.0

       •   "win32_perlio" - allows the use of the :win32 IO layer.

           This was added on perl 5.22.0.

   Ordering matters
       Using this pragma to 'enable an experimental feature' is another way of
       saying that this pragma will disable the warnings which would result
       from using that feature.  Therefore, the order in which pragmas are
       applied is important.  In particular, you probably want to enable
       experimental features after you enable warnings:

         use warnings;
         use experimental 'smartmatch';

       You also need to take care with modules that enable warnings for you.
       A common example being Moose.  In this example, warnings for the
       'smartmatch' feature are first turned on by the warnings pragma, off by
       the experimental pragma and back on again by the Moose module (fix is
       to switch the last two lines):

         use warnings;
         use experimental 'smartmatch';
         use Moose;

   Disclaimer
       Because of the nature of the features it enables, forward compatibility
       can not be guaranteed in any way.
