NAME
       icpld - Internet Connection Performance Logging Daemon


SYNOPSIS
       icpld -ip <ip> [OPTIONS]

       or

       icpld -ip6 <ip> [OPTIONS]

       alternatively a mixture of both

DESCRIPTION
       icpld forks into the background and checks for downtime in a network
       connection.

       You can set it to try against any ip, either on the internet, or on
       your local network in different intervals. As from version 0.6.0 icpld
       also supports IPv6 addresses.

       ICPLD can monitor two connection at once, one IPv4 connection, and an
       IPv6 one.  You can also limit the use to one connection only, by not
       specifying an ip.  If you only want to monitor an IPv6 connection, you
       simply do not specify an IPv4 ip. In case you have both an IPv4 and an
       IPv6 ip specified in the configuration file, you may override this by
       specifying the -4 or the -6 switch. Giving one of these tells icpld to
       only monitor this. Hence -6 only monitors an IPv6 connection, even
       though there is an IPv4 ip specified in the configuration file.

       As the name implies, icpld writes a log as it is running. This logfile
       is by default located in ~/.icpld and is called 'log'. If you want to
       specify another location for your logfile, you can do this by either
       edit the post logFile in the configuration file, or specify one using
       the -logfile option. Normally, when you monitor two connections, they
       are both logged into this default file, but you can however specify a
       special log file for your IPv6 connection, using the -logfile6 switch.

       See below for more options

OPTIONS
         Note that some of these options are only available when
         icpld has been compiled with IPv6 support.

       -h, --help
              Shows the help section and exits -ip This switch is required
              unless there is an IPv6 address specified, and decides which ip
              ICPLD will probe for ICMP replies

       -ip6   This specifies which IPv6 ip icpld will probe for ICMP replies.
              This is optional unless the -6 switch is used. Note that the use
              of one, does not exclude the other. In other words; you can
              monitor both an IPv6 and an IPv4 connection with the same icpld
              process

       -fbip  Fallback ip. This is the ip ICPLD will double check against if
              the ip specified with -ip is not responding

       -fbip6 Same as fbip, but for the IPv6 monitoring.

       -detach
              Giving this argument to icpld will daemonize a process that is
              currently running in the foreground. Useful if you want to
              monitor icpld for a while, and then fork it without having to
              restart icpld and "pollute" the log files

       -6     This option will tell icpld to use IPv6 only. Mainly used to
              ignore IPv4 entries in the configuration file

       -4     This option is used to ignore IPv6 entries in the configuration
              file

       -nd    Prevent ICPLD from daemonizing

       -d     Force ICPLD to damonize (this is default, but can be used to
              override a configuration file setting)

       -s     Silent. Produces no output what so ever. Has no effect in
              combination  with -nd (naturally)

       -m     This option is only useful in combination with -logfile at which
              point -m tells icpld to output the whole logfile at once,
              without breaks. Virtually the same as cat ~/.icpld/log

       -status
              Shows the current state of icpld and the connection

       -log   Displays the performance log

       -turn  Turns the log file over. Old one is saved as ~/.icpld/log.n
              where n is the next available number. A stamp is put in the new
              log, telling you when it was turned

       -reset Resets ICPLD state and log and quit a current ICPLD process

       -quit  Terminates a running ICPLD process. Use this at all times,
              rather than sending signals manually

       -interval
              Sets the interval in which ICPLD will check for an available
              connection (default 10 seconds)

       -dinterval
              Sets the interval with which icpld will check for an available
              connection, once it has been marked as unavailable. Will
              override -interval in case of downtime. The default is 6 seconds

       -pint  Tells icpld how frequent it should send ICMP-packets once it is
              in a checking cycle. This option is equivalent to ping -i
              <double> and should not be confused with -interval Default is
              one packet per second

       -nobeep
              Do not generate a beep when the connection comes back up
              (beeping is only activated when combined with the -nd switch)

       -logfile
              Specifies which logfile to use rather than the default
              ~/.icpld/log Note that this has an impact on -log as well as
              -turn, if you use icpld with different -log options. A log which
              is located in another place than what -logfile says, will not be
              turned.

       -logfile6
              Same as above, but for the IPv6 log. Note that the same file can
              be used for both connections.

       -htmlfile
              ICPLD can, if you want, duplicate the log file into HTML format.
              This switch tells ICPLD where to put the html output.

       -htmlfile6
              Same as above, but for the duplication of the IPv6 log either
              specified by -logfile6 or within the configuration file

       -errfile
              This option tells icpld where to save the log which contains the
              output of ping. The output is only written if the ping failed.
              This is useful for debugging since you can not only see when the
              connection was broken, but also what caused the downtime.

       -errfile6
              Same as the above, but for the IPv6 connection

       -err   Displays the contents of the errors file (default:
              ~/.icpld/errors)

       -err6  Same as the above, but for the IPv6 errors file

       -config
              Specifies which config file to use. The default is
              /usr/local/etc/icpld.conf Usage of the config file at all is
              optional as ICPLD can be operated throughoutly by command line
              as well.

       -iface Specifies which source interface or (on some platforms) address
              to use for the checking

       -v, --version
              Display version info and exits

CONFIG FILE
       ICPLD automatically looks for a configuration file in
       /usr/local/etc/icpld.conf If none is to be found, it will use the
       command line arguments, hence the configuration file is not necessary,
       but may be handy and helpful.

       The location of the config file may be altered by supplying the -config
       switch at command line.

       Note that all command line arguments overrides the values in the
       configuration file.

       Available config options:


       ip     This is the target machine, which we will try to establish
              contact with
              Example: ip=192.168.0.1

       ip6    This is the target machine, which we will check an IPv6
              connection against.
              Example: ip6=3ffe::1

       fbip   Fallback ip. ICPLD will double check the connection status if
              the first ip is not responding, by probing this ip Example:
              ip=192.168.0.2

       fbip6  Same as above, but for the IPv6 connection monitoring
              Example: fbip6=3ffe::2

       interval
              Will determine how often we will check for response from the
              machine specified with ip. The unit is seconds
              Example: interval=10

       dinterval
              Determines how often we will check for an available connection
              after it has been marked as unavailable. The unit is seconds
              Example: dinterval=5

       pint   Tells icpld how frequent it should send ICMP-packets once it is
              in a checking cycle. This option is equivalent to ping -i
              <double> and should not be confused with -interval Default is
              one packet per second.
              Example: pint=1.2

       iface  Specifies which interface or (on some platforms) address to use
              for the checking. This is optional, and if excluded or left
              blank, the kernel default will be used. This only is useful for
              determining which trunk is down if you are on a multi-connected
              system.  logFile Specifies the location of the log file we will
              be stamping.
              Example: logFile=~/.icpld/log

       logFile6
              Same as above, but for the IPv6 log. Note that this option may
              be set identicaly to logFile
              Example: logFile6=~/.icpld/log

       htmlFile
              Same as logFile, but the HTML formatted log.
              Example: htmlFile=~/public_html/icpld.html

       htmlFile6
              Same as above, but the IPv6 log duplication. Note that this may
              be set identicaly to the htmlFile option
              Example: htmlFile6=~/public_html/icpld.html

       daemonize
              ICPLD will either stay in the foreground, or fork to the
              background depending on the value of daemonize. daemonize is of
              boolean type, meaning it is either 'true' or 'false'.
              Example: daemonize=false

       nobeep If ICPLD is active in the foreground, it will generate a beep
              once the connection is back up after downtime. To disable this,
              set nobeep to true. nobeep is of boolean type, meaning it is
              either 'true' or 'false'
              Example: nobeep=true

       cmd4dn This is a system command which will be executed whenever the
              IPv4 connection drops. This can be useful when you wish to be
              alerted whenever your connection goes down.

       cmd4up Same as above, but when the connection comes back up from
              downtime

       cmd6dn This is the same as cmd4dn but for the IPv6 connection

       cmd6up Same as cmd4up but for the IPv6 connection

       errfile
              This option tells icpld where to save the log which contains the
              output of ping. The output is only written if the ping failed.

       errfile6
              Same as the above, but for the IPv6 connection

       Example of a valid and acceptable configuration file
              for users which does not have an IPv6 connection to monitor :

              # ICPLD config file (/etc/icpld.conf)

              ip=192.168.0.1

              fbip=192.168.0.2

              interval=9

              dinterval=5

              pint=1.0

              daemonize=true

              logFile=~/.icpld/log

              htmlFile=~/public_html/icpld.html

              errfile=~/.icpld/errors

              nobeep=false

              cmd4dn=play ~/mysounds/awwww.wav

              cmd4up=play ~/mysounds/yipee.wav


       Example of a valid configuration file for
              monitoring both an IPv4 and an IPv6 connection:


              ip=192.168.0.1

              ip6=3ffe::1

              fbip=192.168.0.2

              fbip6=3ffe::2

              interval=9

              dinterval=5

              pint=1.0

              daemonize=true

              logFile=~/.icpld/log

              logFile6=~/.icpld/log

              htmlFile=~/public_html/icpld.html

              htmlFile=~/public_html/icpld-v6.html

              errfile=~/.icpld/errors

              errfile6=~/.icpld/errors

              nobeep=false

              cmd4dn=play ~/mysounds/awwww.wav

              cmd4up=play ~/mysounds/yipee.wav

              cmd6dn=play ~/mysounds/awwww.wav

              cmd6up=play ~/mysounds/yipee.wav
