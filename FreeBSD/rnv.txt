NAME
       rnv - Relax NG Compact Syntax validator

SYNOPSIS
       rnv [OPTIONS] grammar.rnc [document_1.xml ..]

DESCRIPTION
       RNV uses Relax NG compact syntax schemas to check if a give XML file is
       valid in respect to the language defined by the Relax NG schema. RNV
       uses Expat for XML parsing.

       If you intend to validate against Relax NG schemas in XML syntax
       instead have a look at xmllint (of libxml2) or xmlstarlet. Also trang
       can convert Relax NG schemas from XML to compact syntax and back.

OPTIONS
       If no documents are specified, RNV attempts to read the XML document
       from the standard input. The options are:

       -q     names of files being processed are not printed; in error
              messages, expected elements and attributes are not listed;

       -n number
              sets the maximum number of reported expected elements and
              attributes, -q sets this to 0 and can be overriden;

       -p     copies the input to the output;

       -c     if the only argument is a grammar, checks the grammar and exits;

       -s     uses less memory and runs slower;

       -e library.scm
              uses Scheme datatype library from file library.scm;

       -v     prints version number;

       -h     displays usage summary and exits.
