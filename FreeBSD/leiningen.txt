NAME
       lein - Automate Clojure projects


SYNOPSIS
       lein [-o] [-U] [TASK [ARGS]]
       lein [-h|--help]
       lein [-v|--version]


DESCRIPTION
       Leiningen is for automating Clojure projects without setting your hair
       on fire.

       Working on Clojure projects with tools designed for Java can be an
       exercise in frustration. With Leiningen, you just write Clojure.


TASKS
       lein help will show the complete list of tasks, while lein help TASK
       shows usage for a specific one.

CONFIGURATION
       Leiningen reads its configuration from the project.clj file in your
       project root. Either use lein new to create a fresh project from which
       to work, or see the exhaustive list of configuration options with lein
       help sample.

       You can customize your project map further with profiles; see lein help
       profiles.
