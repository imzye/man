PADLOCK(4)             FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual             PADLOCK(4)

NAME
     padlock – driver for the cryptographic functions and RNG in VIA C3, C7
     and Eden processors

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device crypto
           device padlock

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           padlock_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The C3 and Eden processor series from VIA include hardware acceleration
     for AES.  The C7 series includes hardware acceleration for AES, SHA1,
     SHA256 and RSA.  All of the above processor series include a hardware
     random number generator.

     The padlock driver registers itself to accelerate AES operations and, if
     available, HMAC/SHA1 and HMAC/SHA256 for crypto(4).  It also registers
     itself to accelerate other HMAC algorithms, although there is no hardware
     acceleration for those algorithms.  This is only needed so padlock can
     work with ipsec(4).

     The hardware random number generator supplies data for the kernel
     random(4) subsystem.

HISTORY
     The padlock driver first appeared in OpenBSD.  The first FreeBSD release
     to include it was FreeBSD 6.0.

AUTHORS
     The padlock driver with AES encryption support was written by Jason
     Wright <jason@OpenBSD.org>.  It was ported to FreeBSD and then extended
     to support SHA1 and SHA256 by Pawel Jakub Dawidek <pjd@FreeBSD.org>.
