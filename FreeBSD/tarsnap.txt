TARSNAP-KEYGEN(1)       FreeBSD General Commands Manual      TARSNAP-KEYGEN(1)

NAME
     tarsnap-keygen – generate a key file for use with tarsnap(1)

SYNOPSIS
     tarsnap-keygen --keyfile key-file --user user-name --machine machine-name
                    [--passphrased] [--passphrase-mem maxmem]
                    [--passphrase-time maxtime]
     tarsnap-keygen --version

DESCRIPTION
     tarsnap-keygen generates cryptographic keys, registers with the tarsnap
     server, and writes a key file for use with tarsnap(1).

     The --keyfile key-file option specifies the name of the file in which to
     write the newly-generated keys.  The --user user-name option specifies
     the name (i.e. email address) of the Tarsnap account.  The --machine
     machine-name option specifies a name which will be displayed in
     accounting reports so that you can see how much data each machine is
     storing.

     If the --passphrased option is specified, the user will be prompted to
     enter a passphrase (twice) to be used to encrypt the key file.

     If the --passphrase-mem maxmem option is specified, a maximum of maxmem
     bytes of RAM will be used in the scrypt key derivation function to
     encrypt the key file; it may be necessary to set this option if a key
     file is being generated on a system with far more RAM than the system on
     which the key file will be used.

     If the --passphrase-time maxtime option is specified, a maximum of
     approximately maxtime seconds will be used in the scrypt key derivation
     function to encrypt the key file.

     The --version option prints the version number of tarsnap-keygen, then
     exits.
