SHOWMOUNT(8)            FreeBSD System Manager's Manual           SHOWMOUNT(8)

NAME
     showmount – show remote nfs mounts on host

SYNOPSIS
     showmount [-a | -d] [-E] [-e] [-1] [-3] [host]

DESCRIPTION
     The showmount utility shows status information about the NFS server on
     host.  By default it prints the names of all hosts that have NFS file
     systems mounted on the host.  See NFS: Network File System Protocol
     Specification, RFC 1094, Appendix A, and NFS: Network File System Version
     3 Protocol Specification, Appendix I, for a detailed description of the
     protocol.

     The following options are available:

     -a, --all
             List all mount points in the form:
                   host:dirpath.

     -d, --directories
             List directory paths of mount points instead of hosts.

     -E, --exports-script
             Show the host's exports list in a script-friendly format.  Client
             addresses and the header are not shown, and special characters
             are escaped.

     -e, --exports
             Show the host's exports list.

     -1      Use mount protocol Version 1, compatible with legacy servers.

     -3      Ignored for backwards compatibility.

SEE ALSO
     mount(8), mount_nfs(8), mountd(8)

HISTORY
     The showmount utility first appeared in 4.4BSD.

BUGS
     The mount daemon running on the server only has an idea of the actual
     mounts, since the NFS server is stateless.  The showmount utility will
     only display the information as accurately as the mount daemon reports
     it.
