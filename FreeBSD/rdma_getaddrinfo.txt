RDMA_GETADDRINFO(3)      Librdmacm Programmer's Manual     RDMA_GETADDRINFO(3)



NAME
       rdma_getaddrinfo - Provides transport independent address translation.

SYNOPSIS
       #include <rdma/rdma_cma.h>

       int rdma_getaddrinfo (const char *node, const char *service, const
       struct rdma_addrinfo *hints, struct rdma_addrinfo **res);

ARGUMENTS
       node        Optional, name, dotted-decimal IPv4, or IPv6 hex address to
                   resolve.

       service     Service name or port number of address.

       hints       Reference to an rdma_addrinfo structure containing hints
                   about the type of service the caller supports.

       res         A pointer to a linked list of rdma_addrinfo structures
                   containing response information.

DESCRIPTION
       Resolves the destination node and service address and returns
       information needed to establish communication.  Provides the RDMA
       functional equivalent to getaddrinfo.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error.  If an error occurs, errno will
       be set to indicate the failure reason.

NOTES
       Either node, service, or hints must be provided.  If hints are
       provided, the operation will be controlled by hints.ai_flags.  If
       RAI_PASSIVE is specified, the call will resolve address information for
       use on the passive side of a connection.  If node is provided,
       rdma_getaddrinfo will attempt to resolve the RDMA address, route, and
       connection data to the given node.  The hints parameter, if provided,
       may be used to control the resulting output as indicated below.  If
       node is not given, rdma_getaddrinfo will attempt to resolve the RDMA
       addressing information based on the hints.ai_src_addr,
       hints.ai_dst_addr, or hints.ai_route.

rdma_addrinfo
       ai_flags    Hint flags that control the operation.  Supported flags
                   are:

       RAI_PASSIVE Indicates that the results will be used on the
                   passive/listening side of a connection.

       RAI_NUMERICHOST
                   If specified, then the node parameter, if provided, must be
                   a numerical network address.  This flag suppresses any
                   lengthy address resolution.

       RAI_NOROUTE If set, this flag suppresses any lengthy route resolution.

       RAI_FAMILY  If set, the ai_family setting should be used as an input
                   hint for interpretting the node parameter.

       ai_family   Address family for the source and destination address.
                   Supported families are: AF_INET, AF_INET6, and AF_IB.

       ai_qp_type  Indicates the type of RDMA QP used for communication.
                   Supported types are: IBV_UD (unreliable datagram) and
                   IBV_RC (reliable connected).

       ai_port_space
                   RDMA port space in use.  Supported values are: RDMA_PS_UDP,
                   RDMA_PS_TCP, and RDMA_PS_IB.

       ai_src_len  The length of the source address referenced by ai_src_addr.
                   This will be 0 if an appropriate source address could not
                   be discovered for a given destination.

       ai_dst_len  The length of the destination address referenced by
                   ai_dst_addr.  This will be 0 if the RAI_PASSIVE flag was
                   specified as part of the hints.

       ai_src_addr If provided, the address for the local RDMA device.

       ai_dst_addr If provided, the address for the destination RDMA device.

       ai_src_canonname
                   The canonical for the source.

       ai_dst_canonname
                   The canonical for the destination.

       ai_route_len
                   Size of the routing information buffer referenced by
                   ai_route.  This will be 0 if the underlying transport does
                   not require routing data, or none could be resolved.

       ai_route    Routing information for RDMA transports that require
                   routing data as part of connection establishment.  The
                   format of the routing data depends on the underlying
                   transport.  If Infiniband transports are used, ai_route
                   will reference an array of struct ibv_path_data on output,
                   if routing data is available.  Routing paths may be
                   restricted by setting desired routing data fields on input
                   to rdma_getaddrinfo.  For Infiniband, hints.ai_route may
                   reference an array of struct ibv_path_record or struct
                   ibv_path_data on input.

       ai_connect_len
                   Size of connection information referenced by ai_connect.
                   This will be 0 if the underlying transport does not require
                   additional connection information.

       ai_connect  Data exchanged as part of the connection establishment
                   process.  If provided, ai_connect data must be transferred
                   as private data, with any user supplied private data
                   following it.

       ai_next     Pointer to the next rdma_addrinfo structure in the list.
                   Will be NULL if no more structures exist.
