       Template::Plugin::Lingua::EN::Inflect - Interface to
       Lingua::EN::Inflect module

SYNOPSIS

         [% FILTER inflect(number => 42); -%]
           There PL_V(was) NO(error).
           PL_ADJ(This) PL_N(error) PL_V(was) fatal.
         [% END; -%]

         [% "... and "; infl.ORD(9); "ly..." %]

         # Output:
         #   There were 42 errors.
         #   These errors were fatal.
         #   ... and 9thly...

DESCRIPTION
       The Lingua::EN::Inflect is an interface to Damian Conway's
       Linua::EN::Inflect Perl module, which provides plural inflections,
       "a"/"an" selection for English words, and manipulation of numbers as
       words.

       The plugin provides an 'inflect' filter, which can be used to
       interpolate inflections in a string.  The NUM() function sets a
       persistent default value to be used whenever an optional number
       argument is omitted.  The number to be used for a particular invocation
       of 'inflect' can also be specified with a 'number' option.

       For the full gory details of the inflection functionality refer to the
       Lingua::EN::Inflect manual.

OBJECT METHODS
       "infl.A($string, $opt_number)"
           prepends the appropriate indefinite article to a word, depending on
           its pronunciation.  If the second argument is provided and its
           value is numeric and not 1 then the value of the second argument is
           used instead.

           e.g. "infl.A("idea")" returns "an idea"

       "AN($string, $opt_number)"
           synonym for A()

       "NO($string, $opt_arg)"
           given a word and an optional count, returns the count followed by
           the correctly inflected word

       "NUM($string, $opt_arg)"
           sets a persistent default number value, which is subsequently used
           whenever an optional second number argument is omitted.  The
           default value thus set can subsequently be removed by calling NUM()
           with no arguments.  NUM() normally returns its first argument,
           however if NUM() is called with a second argument that is defined
           and evaluates to false then NUM() returns an empty string.

       "NUMWORDS($string, $opt_arg)"
           takes a number (cardinal or ordinal) and returns an English
           represen- tation of that number. In a scalar context a string is
           returned. In a list context each comma-separated chunk is returned
           as a separate element.

       ORD($number)
           takes a single argument and forms its ordinal equivalent.  If the
           argument isn't a numerical integer, it just adds "-th".

       "PART_PRES($string, $opt_arg)"
           returns the present participle for a third person singluar verb

               PART_PRES("runs");          # returns "running"

       "PL($string, $opt_arg)"
           returns the plural of a singular English noun, pronoun, verb or
           adjective.

       "PL_N($string, $opt_arg)"
           returns the plural of a singular English noun or pronoun.

       "PL_V($string, $opt_arg)"
           returns the plural conjugation of the singular form of a conjugated
           verb.

       "PL_ADJ($string, $opt_arg)"
           returns the plural form of a singular form of certain types of
           adjectives.

       "PL_eq($string, $opt_arg)"
       "PL_N_eq($string, $opt_arg)"
       "PL_V_eq($string, $opt_arg)"
       "PL_ADJ_eq($string, $opt_arg)"
       "classical($string, $opt_arg)"
       "def_noun($string, $opt_arg)"
       "def_verb($string, $opt_arg)"
       "def_adj($string, $opt_arg)"
       "def_a($string, $opt_arg)"
       "def_an($string, $opt_arg)"

INTERNAL METHODS
       "tt_inflect($string, $opt_arg)"
           The underlying inflect filter.

TODO
       Finish off documenting the object methods.

       Provide tests for all methods in the test suite.

       It would also be nice to have methods that spelled out numbers that
       were less than a certain threshold and that formatted large numbers
       with commas, for example:

            inflect("There PL_V(was) NO(error).", number => 0);
            # outputs: "There were no errors."

            inflect("There PL_V(was) NO(error).", number => 1);
            # outputs: "There was one errors."

            inflect("There PL_V(was) NO(error).", number => 3);
            # outputs: "There were three errors."

            inflect("There PL_V(was) NO(error).", number => 1042);
            # outputs: "There were 1,042 errors."

       This would require changes to the Lingua::EN::Inflect module.
