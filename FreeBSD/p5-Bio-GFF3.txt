Bio::GFF3::LowLevel(3)                     User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Bio::GFF3::LowLevel - fast, low-level functions for parsing and
       formatting GFF3

SYNOPSIS
         use Bio::GFF3::LowLevel qw/ gff3_parse_feature /;

         open my $gff3_fh, 'myfile.gff3' or die;
         while( <$gff3_fh> ) {
           next if /^#/;
           my $feat = gff3_parse_feature( $_ );
         }

DESCRIPTION
       These are low-level, fast functions for parsing GFF version 3 files.
       All they do is convert back and forth between low-level Perl data
       structures and GFF3 text.

       Sometimes this is what you need when you are just doing simple
       transformations on GFF3.  I found myself writing these functions over
       and over again, until I finally got fed up enough to just package them
       up properly.

       These functions do no validation, do not reconstruct feature
       hierarchies, or anything like that.  If you want that, use
       Bio::FeatureIO.

       All of the functions in this module are EXPORT_OK, meaning that you can
       add their name after using this module to make them available in your
       namespace.

FUNCTIONS
   gff3_parse_feature( $line )
       Given a string containing a GFF3 feature line (i.e. not a comment),
       parses it and returns a hashref of its information, of the form:

           {
               seq_id => 'chr02',
               source => 'AUGUSTUS',
               type   => 'transcript',
               start  => '23486',
               end    => '48209',
               score  => '0.02',
               strand => '+',
               phase  => undef,
               attributes => {
                   ID => [
                       'chr02.g3.t1'
                     ],
                   Parent => [
                       'chr02.g3'
                     ],
                 },
           }

       Note that all values are simple scalars, except for "attributes", which
       is a hashref as returned by "gff3_parse_attributes" below.

       Unescaping is performed according to the GFF3 specification.

   gff3_parse_attributes( $attr_string )
       Given a GFF3 attribute string, parse it and return a hashref of its
       data, of the form:

           {
             'attribute_name' => [ value, value, ... ],
             ...
           }

       Always returns a hashref.  If the passed attribute string is undefined,
       or ".", the hashref returned will be empty.  Attribute values are
       always arrayrefs, even if they have only one value.

   gff3_parse_directive( $line )
       Parse a GFF3 directive/metadata line.  Returns a hashref as:

         {  directive => 'directive-name',
            value     => 'the contents of the directive'
         }

       Or nothing if the line could not be parsed as a GFF3 directive.

       In addition, "sequence-region" and "genome-build" directives are parsed
       further.  "sequence-region" hashrefs have additional "seq_id", "start",
       and "end" keys, and "genome-build" hashrefs have additional "source"
       and "buildname" keys

   gff3_format_feature( \%fields )
       Given a hashref of feature information in the same format returned by
       "gff3_parse_feature" above, constructs a correctly-escaped line of GFF3
       encoding that information.

       The line ends with a single newline character, a UNIX-style line
       ending, regardless of the local operating system.

   gff3_format_attributes( \%attrs )
       Given a hashref of GFF3 attributes in the same format returned by
       "gff3_parse_attributes" above, returns a correctly formatted and
       escaped GFF3 attribute string (the 9th column of a GFF3 feature line)
       encoding those attributes.

       For convenience, single-valued attributes can have simple scalars as
       values in the passed hashref.  For example, if a feature has only one
       "ID" attribute (as it should), you can pass "{ ID => 'foo' }" instead
       of "{ ID => ['foo'] }}".

   gff3_escape( $string )
       Given a string, escapes special characters in that string according to
       the GFF3 specification.

   gff3_unescape( $string )
       Unescapes a GFF3-escaped string.
