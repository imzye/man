DBIx::DisconnectAll(3)                     User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       DBIx::DisconnectAll - disconnect all databases

SYNOPSIS
         use DBIx::DisconnectAll;

         dbi_disconnect_all();

DESCRIPTION
       DBIx::DisconnectAll is utility module to disconnect all connected
       databases

       DBI has DBI->disconnect_all methods, but some DBD modules does not
       support it, so DBI->disconnect_all is undocumented yet and unusable.

       DBIx::DisconnectAll realizes disconnect_all from DBI's public API.
