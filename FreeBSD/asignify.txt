NAME
       asignify - cryptographically sign, verify, encrypt or decrypt files.

SYNOPSIS
       asignify [-q] verify pubkey signature

       asignify [-q] check pubkey signature file [file...]

       asignify [-q] sign [-n] [-d digest] [-s sshkey] secretkey signature
       [file1 [file2...]]

       asignify [-q] generate [-n] [-r rounds] secretkey [publickey]

       asignify [-q] encrypt [-d] secretkey publickey infile outfile

       asignify [-q] decrypt secretkey publickey infile outfile

DESCRIPTION
       The asignify utility creates and verifies cryptographic signatures. A
       signature is stamped on a digests file that contains hash digests of
       files using various hash functions (namely, sha256, sha512 and
       blake2b).

       The mode of operation is selected with the following options:

       -q      Quiet mode. Suppress informational output.

       verify  Verify signarure for a digests file (but do not verify digests
               themselves):

               pubkey      Name of the file with a public key.

               signature   Name of signature file.

       check   Verify a signed digests list, and then verify the checksum for
               each file listed in the arguments and specified in the digests
               list:

               pubkey      Name of the file with a public key.

               signature   Name of a signature file.

               file        List of files whose digests need to be verified.

       generate
               Generate a new key pair of secret and public keys:

               -n, --no-password
                           Do not ask for a passphrase during key generation.
                           Otherwise, asignify will prompt the user for a
                           passphrase to encrypt the secret key with.

               -r, --rounds
                           Indicate a number of iterations (rounds) used by
                           PBKDF algorithm (default number of rounds: 10000).

               -s, --ssh   Convert unencrypted ed25519 private key generated
                           by openssh to the native asignify format. The
                           target key could be encrypted as usually.

               secretkey   Mandatory path to file where secret key will be
                           writen.

               pubkey      Optional path to file where public key will be
                           writed and by default will be generated from as
                           [secretkey].pub. This option is not used with ssh
                           keys.

       sign    Calculate digests for the files specified and create a signed
               digests file:

               -n, --no-size
                           Do not record files sizes in signature file.

               -d, --digest
                           Indicate a hash function which will be used for
                           singing. Currently the asignify has support of
                           following hashes: sha256(1), sha512(1), blake2
                           (default if none is defined). It is possible to
                           specify multiple -d options to calculate multiple
                           checksums for each file.

               secretkey   Name of the file with a secret key.

               signature   Name of file where signed digests will be stored.

               file        List of file(s) to calculate digests for.

       encrypt Encrypt a file using local private key and remote public key
               (and vice-versa for decryption):

               -d, --decrypt
                           Decrypt using remote privkey and local pubkey (that
                           is same as invoking this command as decrypt)

               secretkey   Name of the file with a secret key: local for
                           encryption and remote for decryption.

               publickey   Name of the file with a public key: remote for
                           encryption and local for decryption.

               in          The name of input file.

               out         The name of output file.

EXIT STATUS
       The asignify return zero exit code on success, and non-zero if an error
       occurs.  It may  fail because of one of the following reasons:

       - Some files requested are absent.
       - Passphrase is incorrect (or passphrase and verification are not
       equal).
       - The message file has been corrupted and its signature is no longer
       valid.

EXAMPLES
       Create a new key pair:

        $ asignify generate keys/key.secret keys/key.public

       Sign a file, specifying a signature name:

        $ asignify sign -d blake2 keys/key.secret motd.sig /etc/motd

       Verify a signature:

        $ asignify verify keys/key.public motd.sig

       Verify a signed digest list:

        $ asignify check keys/key.public motd.sig /etc/motd
