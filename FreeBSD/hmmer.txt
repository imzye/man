NAME
       alimask - calculate and add column mask to a multiple sequence
       alignment


SYNOPSIS
       alimask [options] msafile postmsafile



DESCRIPTION
       alimask is used to apply a mask line to a multiple sequence alignment,
       based on provided alignment or model coordinates.  When hmmbuild
       receives a masked alignment as input, it produces a profile model in
       which the emission probabilities at masked positions are set to match
       the background frequency, rather than being set based on observed
       frequencies in the alignment.  Position-specific insertion and deletion
       rates are not altered, even in masked regions.  alimask autodetects
       input format, and produces masked alignments in Stockholm format.
       msafile may contain only one sequence alignment.


       A common motivation for masking a region in an alignment is that the
       region contains a simple tandem repeat that is observed to cause an
       unacceptably high rate of false positive hits.


       In the simplest case, a mask range is given in coordinates relative to
       the input alignment, using --alirange <s>.  However it is more often
       the case that the region to be masked has been identified in
       coordinates relative to the profile model (e.g. based on recognizing a
       simple repeat pattern in false hit alignments or in the HMM logo).  Not
       all alignment columns are converted to match state positions in the
       profile (see the --symfrac flag for hmmbuild for discussion), so model
       positions do not necessarily match up to alignment column positions.
       To remove the burden of converting model positions to alignment
       positions, alimask accepts the mask range input in model coordinates as
       well, using --modelrange <s>.  When using this flag, alimask determines
       which alignment positions would be identified by hmmbuild as match
       states, a process that requires that all hmmbuild flags impacting that
       decision be supplied to alimask.  It is for this reason that many of
       the hmmbuild flags are also used by alimask.




OPTIONS
       -h     Help; print a brief reminder of command line usage and all
              available options.


       -o <f> Direct the summary output to file <f>, rather than to stdout.



OPTIONS FOR SPECIFYING MASK RANGE
       A single mask range is given as a dash-separated pair, like
       --modelrange 10-20 and multiple ranges may be submitted as a comma-
       separated list, --modelrange 10-20,30-42.



       --modelrange <s>
              Supply the given range(s) in model coordinates.


       --alirange <s>
              Supply the given range(s) in alignment coordinates.


       --appendmask
              Add to the existing mask found with the alignment.  The default
              is to overwrite any existing mask.


       --model2ali <s>
              Print model range(s) and the corresponding alignment range(s).
              No masked alignment is produced.  The output is a single line
              for each input range, of the form
                 i..j -> m..n
              with i & j representing model range values, and m & n
              representing alignment range values.


       --ali2model <s>
              Print alignment range(s) and the corresponding model range(s).
              No masked alignment is produced.  Because some alignment
              positions may not map to model positions, the range(s) produced
              will begin with the first alignment position between <from> and
              <to> (inclusive) that maps to a model position, and end with the
              final alignment position in that range that maps to a model
              position.  The output is a single line for each input range, of
              the form
                i..j -> m..n
              with i & j representing alignment range values, and m & n
              representing model range values.  If no alignment positions in
              the range <from>..<to> map to a model position, the output
              prints the input <from> and <to> mapping to nothing, with the
              format:
               i..j  ->   -..-  (no map) .



OPTIONS FOR SPECIFYING THE ALPHABET
       --amino
              Assert that sequences in msafile are protein, bypassing alphabet
              autodetection.


       --dna  Assert that sequences in msafile are DNA, bypassing alphabet
              autodetection.


       --rna  Assert that sequences in msafile are RNA, bypassing alphabet
              autodetection.




OPTIONS CONTROLLING PROFILE CONSTRUCTION
       These options control how consensus columns are defined in an
       alignment.


       --fast Define consensus columns as those that have a fraction >=
              symfrac of residues as opposed to gaps. (See below for the
              --symfrac option.) This is the default.


       --hand Define consensus columns in next profile using reference
              annotation to the multiple alignment.  This allows you to define
              any consensus columns you like.


       --symfrac <x>
              Define the residue fraction threshold necessary to define a
              consensus column when using the --fast option. The default is
              0.5. The symbol fraction in each column is calculated after
              taking relative sequence weighting into account, and ignoring
              gap characters corresponding to ends of sequence fragments (as
              opposed to internal insertions/deletions).  Setting this to 0.0
              means that every alignment column will be assigned as consensus,
              which may be useful in some cases. Setting it to 1.0 means that
              only columns that include 0 gaps (internal insertions/deletions)
              will be assigned as consensus.


       --fragthresh <x>
              We only want to count terminal gaps as deletions if the aligned
              sequence is known to be full-length, not if it is a fragment
              (for instance, because only part of it was sequenced). HMMER
              uses a simple rule to infer fragments: if the sequence length L
              is less than or equal to a fraction <x> times the alignment
              length in columns, then the sequence is handled as a fragment.
              The default is 0.5.  Setting --fragthresh 0 will define no
              (nonempty) sequence as a fragment; you might want to do this if
              you know you've got a carefully curated alignment of full-length
              sequences.  Setting --fragthresh 1 will define all sequences as
              fragments; you might want to do this if you know your alignment
              is entirely composed of fragments, such as translated short
              reads in metagenomic shotgun data.



OPTIONS CONTROLLING RELATIVE WEIGHTS
       HMMER uses an ad hoc sequence weighting algorithm to downweight closely
       related sequences and upweight distantly related ones. This has the
       effect of making models less biased by uneven phylogenetic
       representation. For example, two identical sequences would typically
       each receive half the weight that one sequence would.  These options
       control which algorithm gets used.


       --wpb  Use the Henikoff position-based sequence weighting scheme
              [Henikoff and Henikoff, J. Mol. Biol. 243:574, 1994].  This is
              the default.


       --wgsc Use the Gerstein/Sonnhammer/Chothia weighting algorithm
              [Gerstein et al, J. Mol. Biol. 235:1067, 1994].


       --wblosum
              Use the same clustering scheme that was used to weight data in
              calculating BLOSUM substitution matrices [Henikoff and Henikoff,
              Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci 89:10915, 1992]. Sequences are single-
              linkage clustered at an identity threshold (default 0.62; see
              --wid) and within each cluster of c sequences, each sequence
              gets relative weight 1/c.


       --wnone
              No relative weights. All sequences are assigned uniform weight.


       --wid <x>
              Sets the identity threshold used by single-linkage clustering
              when using --wblosum.  Invalid with any other weighting scheme.
              Default is 0.62.






OTHER OPTIONS
       --informat <s>
              Assert that input msafile is in alignment format <s>, bypassing
              format autodetection.  Common choices for <s> include:
              stockholm, a2m, afa, psiblast, clustal, phylip.  For more
              information, and for codes for some less common formats, see
              main documentation.  The string <s> is case-insensitive (a2m or
              A2M both work).



       --outformat <s>
              Write the output postmsafile in alignment format <s>.  Common
              choices for <s> include: stockholm, a2m, afa, psiblast, clustal,
              phylip.  The string <s> is case-insensitive (a2m or A2M both
              work).  Default is stockholm.



       --seed <n>
              Seed the random number generator with <n>, an integer >= 0.  If
              <n> is nonzero, any stochastic simulations will be reproducible;
              the same command will give the same results.  If <n> is 0, the
              random number generator is seeded arbitrarily, and stochastic
              simulations will vary from run to run of the same command.  The
              default seed is 42.
