NAME
       DateTime::Fiscal::Year - Calculate the day or week of the Fiscal Year
       with an arbitrary start date

SYNOPSIS
         use DateTime;
         use DateTime::Fiscal::Year;

         my $dt = DateTime->new(year=>2003, month=>02, day=>01);
         my $dt2 = DateTime->new(year=>2003, month=>03, day=>01);

         my $fiscal = DateTime::Fiscal::Year->new( start => $dt );

         $fiscal->day_of_fiscal_year( $dt2 );

               or

         $fiscal->week_of_fiscal_year( $dt2 );

               or

         $fiscal->period_of_fiscal_year( 12, $dt2 );

               or

         $fiscal->quarter_fiscal_year( 13, $dt2 );

DESCRIPTION
       This module allows you to calulate the day, week, period or quarter of
       a date in a fiscal year, given a start date and either a target date or
       number of periods and target date. This is often needed in business,
       where the fiscal year begins and ends on different days than the
       calendar year. This module is based on the Gregorian calendar. Using
       other DT calendar objects will return results, but the behavior is
       unpredicatable for calendars that have more than 365 or 366 days.

USAGE
       This module implements the following methods:

       •   new(start => $dt)

           The new() method has one named parameter start. The argument to
           start is a valid DateTime object. This date is the first day of the
           fiscal year and is used to calculate the offset for the target
           date.

       •   day_of_fiscal_year( $dt2 )

           Returns the day of the fiscal year as calculated from the start
           date given $dt2 is a valid DateTime object.

             my $dt = DateTime->new(year=>2003, month=>02, day=>01);
             my $dt2 = DateTime->new(year=>2003, month=>03, day=>01);

             my $fiscal = DateTime::Fiscal::Year->new( start => $dt );

             my $dofy = $fiscal->day_of_fiscal_year( $dt2 );

           Day of fiscal year ($dofy) is 29. If given the same day for start
           and target, the value is 1.

       •   week_of_fiscal_year( $dt2 )

           Returns the week of the fiscal year as calculated from the start
           date given $dt2 is a valid DateTime object.

             my $dt = DateTime->new(year=>2003, month=>02, day=>01);
             my $dt2 = DateTime->new(year=>2003, month=>03, day=>01);

             my $fiscal = DateTime::Fiscal::Year->new( start => $dt );

             my $wofy = $fiscal->week_of_fiscal_year( $dt2 );

           Week of fiscal year ($wofy) is 5. There is not a week 0 or 53. This
           module was built to assist in financial applications not to satisfy
           the ISO.

       •   period_of_fiscal_year( <number of periods> , $dt2 )

           Returns the period of the fiscal year given the first argument is
           the number of fiscal periods and the second argument is a valid
           DateTime object. Right now the only acceptable number of periods is
           either 12 or 13.

       •   quarter_of_fiscal_year( <number of periods>, $dt2 )

           Returns the quarter of the fiscal year given the first argument is
           the number of fiscal periods and the second argument is a valid
           DateTime object. Right now the only acceptable number of periods is
           either 12 or 13.
