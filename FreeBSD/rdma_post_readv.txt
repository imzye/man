RDMA_POST_READV(3)       Librdmacm Programmer's Manual      RDMA_POST_READV(3)



NAME
       rdma_post_readv - post an RDMA read work request.

SYNOPSIS
       #include <rdma/rdma_verbs.h>

       int rdma_post_readv (struct rdma_cm_id *id, void *context, struct
       ibv_sge *sgl, int nsge, int flags, uint64_t remote_addr, uint32_t
       rkey);

ARGUMENTS
       id          A reference to a communication identifier where the request
                   will be posted.

       context     User-defined context associated with the request.

       sgl         A scatter-gather list of the destination buffers of the
                   read.

       nsge        The number of scatter-gather array entries.

       flags       Optional flags used to control the read operation.

       remote_addr The address of the remote registered memory to read from.

       rkey        The registered memory key associated with the remote
                   address.

DESCRIPTION
       Posts a work request to the send queue of the queue pair associated
       with the rdma_cm_id.  The contents of the remote memory region will be
       read into the local data buffers.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error.  If an error occurs, errno will
       be set to indicate the failure reason.

NOTES
       For a list of supported flags, see ibv_post_send.  Both the remote and
       local data buffers must have been registered before the read is issued,
       and the buffers must remain registered until the read completes.

       Read operations may not be posted to an rdma_cm_id or the corresponding
       queue pair until it has been connected.

       The user-defined context associated with the read request will be
       returned to the user through the work completion wr_id, work request
       identifier, field.
