Test2::Tools::Explain(3)                   User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Test2::Tools::Explain -- Explain tools for Perl's Test2 framework

VERSION
       Version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
       Test2::Suite dropped the explain() function that had been part of
       Test::More.  For those who miss it in Test2, you can use
       Test2::Tools::Explain.

           use Test2::Tools::Explain;

           my $errors = fleeble_the_whatzit();
           is( $errors, [], 'Should have no errors from fleebling' ) or diag explain( $errors );

EXPORTS
       All functions in this module are exported by default.

SUBROUTINES
   explain( @things_to_explain )
       Will convert the contents of any references in a human readable format,
       and return them as strings.  Usually you want to pass this into "note"
       or "diag".

       Handy for things like:

           is( $errors, [], 'Should have no errors' ) or diag explain( $errors );

       Note that "explain" does NOT output anything.
