NAME
     emu803 – Elliott 803 emulator

SYNOPSIS
     emu803 [-V] command_file [file ...]
     emu803 [-i] [-e command_file]

DESCRIPTION
     The emu803 is an emulator for the Elliott 803 Computer. It emulates all
     arithmetic and logic operations and some of the peripherals.

     A single script may be specified using the -e option.

     The following options are available:

     -V      Display the program version on stdout and exit.

     -i      Enter interactive mode after all commands have been processed,
             this is the default if no other arguments are specified.

     -e command_file
             Append the commands commands found in the file command_file to
             the list of commands to be executed at startup.  The commands
             must each be listed on a separate line.

Output Window
     The output window is selected by using one of the function keys listed
     below:

     [F1] Punch 1       Display the output of Punch 1 using Elliott to UTF-8
                        conversion.

     [F2] Punch 1       Display the output of Punch 2 using Elliott to UTF-8
                        conversion.

     [F3] Teleprinter   Display the output of the teleprinter Elliott to UTF-8
                        conversion.

     [F4] Console       Display the results of console commands.

Console Commands
     The following commands can be typed in the console window.  Output is
     only visible if the Console Window [F4] is selected.

     help
     ()?                    Display the list of console commands.

     exit
     (x)                    Exit emulation.

     list [ADDR [COUNT]]
     (l)                    Display “COUNT” memory words starting at “ADDR”

     mw ADDR CODE|±DEC      Write memory word to “ADDR”

     reset                  Reset all registers and stop execution.

     reset run              Reset all registers and restart from location
                            zero.

     run [ADDR]             start running from “ADDR” or continue after a
                            stop.

     stop                   Stop execution.

     regs
     (r)                    Display registers and and current execution
                            status.

     hello [ADDR [1|2|3]]   Load a simple hello world machine code program
                            [4096 1]

     reader 1|2 [MODE] FILE
                            Attach an existing file to a reader. Default mode
                            is hex5.

     punch 1|2 [MODE] FILE  Create a new file and attach to a punch. Default
                            mode is hex5.

     wg [msb|o2l|lsb|CODE|±N]
                            Set or display word generator.

     wait N                 Wait up to N seconds or for either a stop
                            condition or for word generator polling.

     screen 1|2|3|4         Switch screen (as F1…F4) for use in scripts

ENVIRONMENT
     The following environment variables affect the execution of emu803:

     E803_TAPE_DIR  A colon separated string of directories that are searches
                    for tape files for the “reader” command.

     LANG           The locale to use when for curses output must be set to
                    UTF-8 to support the wide characters used in this program.
                    See environ(7) for more information.

     TERM           The terminal specified need to be one that is supported by
                    the wide character version of the ncurses library.

EXIT STATUS
     The emu803 utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Load the internal machine code hello program:

           reset

BUGS
     Function 56 “Divide A/AR by N” is not fully tested and its overflow
     conditions is not likely to be correct.  Currently it will only overflow
     on division by zero.

     The plotter is not implemented.

     The Film Handlers are not implemented.

     The teleprinter input is not implemented.
