DESCRIPTION
       man2web outputs man pages and keyword (apropos) searches in HTML, and
       generates HTML indexes of man page sections.
       man2web's main purpose is as a CGI program, taking arguments from the
       environment (see ENVIRONMENT below), but it can also be used on the
       command line to generate static HTML pages.

OPTIONS
       -s section
       --section=section
           Specifiy the section of the manual to search in.

       -a, --apropos keyword
       -k, --keyword keyword
           Do a keyword (apropos) search for keyword.

       -i, --index section
           Generate and print an index for section.

       -r, --raw
           Do not convert the file, print the raw man output.

       -l, --lynx
           Display the output in Lynx.

       -p, --print-config
           Print out the current configuration, suitable for saving as a
           man2web.conf(5) config file.

       -h, --help
           Print a help message with a list of options.

       -v, --version
           Print the version number and exit.

EXAMPLES
       Command Line


           man2web name > outfile.html
               This would output the man page for name and and save it to a
               file.

           man2web --print-config > man2web.conf
               This would print out the current configuration, saving it to
               man2web.conf.

       CGI

           This is the most common use for man2web.  The web server calls the
           man2web setting the QUERY_STRING and SCRIPT_NAME environment
           variables (see ENVIRONMENT below).  Query string examples follow:

           program=intro&section=1
               This would return the intro man page from section 1.

           program=section-index&section=2
               This would generate a section index for section 2.

           program=groff&section=apropos
               This would return the results of a keyword (apropos) search for
               groff.

ENVIRONMENT
       QUERY_STRING
           This is passed by the web server to the program specifying the type
           of action to be performed, and any parameters,  See EXAMPLES above
           for examples of what this looks like.

       SCRIPT_NAME
           This specifies the way the program is referenced by the web server,
           and how to write out self referencing URLs (links to other man
           pages, or the cover/search page.)  If this is set, the command line
           is disabled, and options must be specified in the QUERY_STRING
           environment variable.
