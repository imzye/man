JEXEC(8)                FreeBSD System Manager's Manual               JEXEC(8)

NAME
     jexec – execute a command inside an existing jail

SYNOPSIS
     jexec [-l] [-u username | -U username] jail [command ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The jexec utility executes command inside the jail identified by its jid
     or name.  If command is not specified then the user's shell is used.

     The following options are available:

     -l      Execute in a clean environment.  The environment is discarded
             except for HOME, SHELL, TERM, USER, and anything from the login
             class capability database for the user.

     -u username
             The user name from host environment as whom the command should
             run.  This is the default.

     -U username
             The user name from jailed environment as whom the command should
             run.

SEE ALSO
     jail_attach(2), jail(8), jls(8)

HISTORY
     The jexec utility was added in FreeBSD 5.1.

BUGS
     If the jail is not identified by jid there is a possible race in between
     the lookup of the jail and executing the command inside the jail.  Giving
     a jid has a similar race as another process can stop the jail and start
     another one after the user looked up the jid.
