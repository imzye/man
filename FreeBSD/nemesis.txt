NAME
     nemesis-arp – ARP/RARP Protocol (The Nemesis Project)

SYNOPSIS
     nemesis-arp [-rsTRvZ?] [-d IFNAME] [-D ADDR] [-h MAC] [-H MAC] [-m MAC]
                 [-M MAC] [-P FILE] [-S ADDR]

DESCRIPTION
     nemesis is designed to be a command line-based, portable human IP stack
     for UNIX-like and Windows systems.  The suite is broken down by protocol,
     and should allow for useful scripting of injected packets from simple
     shell scripts.

     nemesis-arp provides an interface to craft and inject ARP frames allowing
     the user to specify any portion of an ARP frame.

ARP/RARP OPTIONS
     -D ADDR
             Specify the destination IP address of the injected ARP frame.

     -h MAC  Specify the sender hardware address within the ARP frame only.

     -m MAC  Specify the target hardware address within the ARP frame only.

     -P FILE
             This will cause nemesis-arp to use the specified payload FILE as
             the payload when injecting ARP/RARP frames.  The maximum payload
             size is 1472 bytes in order to account for the maximum Ethernet
             frame size.  Payloads can also be read from stdin by specifying
             -P- instead.

     -r      Enables ARP/RARP replies.

     -R      Enables RARP mode.

     -s      When performing ARP requests, rather than zero out the 6 byte
             target hardware address field within the ARP frame, Solaris
             systems copy the target hardware address from the Ethernet header
             into this field.  This option emulates Solaris systems by setting
             the target hardware address within ARP frame to ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
             rather than the standard 00:00:00:00:00:00.

     -S ADDR
             Specify the source IP address of the injected ARP frame.

     -v      Display the injected packet in human readable form.  Use twice to
             see a hexdump of the injected packet with printable ASCII
             characters on the right.  Use three times for a hexdump without
             decoded ASCII.

DATA LINK OPTIONS
     -d IFNAME
             Specify the name (for UNIX-like systems) or the number (for
             Windows systems) of the IFNAME to use (eg. fxp0, eth0, hme0, 1).

     -H MAC  Specify the source MAC address (XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX).

     -M MAC  Specify the destintion MAC address (XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX).

     -Z      Lists the available network interfaces by number for use in link-
             layer injection.

             NOTE: This feature is only relevant to Windows systems.

DIAGNOSTICS
     nemesis-arp returns 0 on a successful exit, 1 if it exits on an error.
