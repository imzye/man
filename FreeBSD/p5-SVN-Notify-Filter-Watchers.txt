SVN::Notify::Filter::Watchers(3)           User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       SVN::Notify::Filter::Watchers - Subscribe to SVN::Notify commits with a
       Subversion property.

VERSION
       Version 0.09

SYNOPSIS
       Use svnnotify in post-commit:

         svnnotify --p "$1" --r "$2" --to you@example.com --handler HTML \
         --filter Watchers

       Use the class in a custom script:

         use SVN::Notify;

         my $notifier = SVN::Notify->new(
             repos_path => $path,
             revision   => $rev,
             to         => 'you@example.com',
             handler    => 'HTML::ColorDiff',
             filters    => [ 'Watchers' ],
         );
         $notifier->prepare;
         $notifier->execute;

DESCRIPTION
       This SVN::Notify::Filter will allow you to add additional recipients to
       an email by checking a Subversion property (default of "svnx:watchers",
       and can be overridden with "watcher_property" (or "--watcher-property"
       option for "svnnotify"). The value of the watcher property is a new
       line and/or space separated list of email addresses.

       This filter will walk up the path to root for each path entry that has
       changed and add recipients if the watcher property has been set. This
       way you can in effect set the property on "/trunk" and get ALL commits
       that happen below "/trunk". When an path has been deleted it will check
       the previous revision for the watcher property. You can also set
       "skip_walking_up" ("--skip-walking-up") to stop this behavior.

       By default the filter will then walk down the path of a deleted path
       and check for recipients to add. This behavior can be changed by adding
       setting "skip_deleted_paths" (or "--skip-deleted-paths").

       Since this is just a filter, there are certain behaviors we can't
       control, such as not requiring at least on "--to" address. Unless you
       have some addresses that should get all commits, regardless of the
       watcher property, you may want to set the "--to" to some address that
       goes to "/dev/null" or does not bounce.  However, if you set
       "trim_original_to" ("--trim-original-to"), it will remove the "--to"
       addresses before it finds all the watcher properties.
