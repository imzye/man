NOATTACH(8)             FreeBSD System Manager's Manual            NOATTACH(8)

NAME
     noattach – scan email messages for bad attachments

SYNOPSIS
     noattach [-hn] [-p portinfo]

DESCRIPTION
     Noattach is a milter that parses the body of email messages from
     sendmail(8) and checks if the filename of attachments matches one of the
     regular expressions in a given pattern file and rejects those emails that
     match.

     Filenames are rfc2047 or rfc2231 decoded if needed.

     The options are as follows:

     -h          Display a short help with commandline options.

     -n          Makes the program stay in foreground, i.e. don't fork into
                 the background and don't update the pid file

     -p portinfo
                 The port to listen to

EXAMPLES
     Listen to ipv4 port 26 on localhost:

     noattach -p inet:26@localhost

     Listen on a unix socket:

     noattach -p local:/var/run/f1.sock

     You also need to add INPUT_MAIL_FILTER to the .mc file you use to make
     the sendmail.cf.

     Information about the parameters for INPUT_MAIL_FILTER is in the
     README.libmilter file wich is in the source tree.

FILES
     These pathnames are set at complie time.

     /usr/local/etc/noattach.patterns
