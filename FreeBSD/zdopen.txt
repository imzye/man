ZOPEN(3)               FreeBSD Library Functions Manual               ZOPEN(3)

NAME
     zopen – open a gzip compressed stream

LIBRARY
     Compression Library (libz, -lz)

SYNOPSIS
     FILE *
     zopen(const char *path, const char *mode);

     FILE *
     zdopen(int fd, const char *mode);

DESCRIPTION
     The zopen() function opens a gzip file whose name is the string pointed
     to by path and returns a stream which can be used to access the
     uncompressed contents of the file.  The zdopen() variant takes a gzip
     file referenced by the file descriptor fd, analogous to fdopen(3).  They
     are wrappers around zlib(3) and the standard stream I/O APIs.

     The argument mode has the same meaning as it does in fopen(3).

     The zopen() and zdopen() functions will associate the read, write, seek
     and close functions of zlib(3) with the returned stream.

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion zopen() and zdopen() return a FILE pointer.
     Otherwise, NULL is returned and the global variable errno is set to
     indicate the error.

ERRORS
     In addition to the errors documented for fopen(3) and fdopen(3), the
     functions may also fail for:

     [ENOMEM]           Insufficient memory is available.

COMPATIBILITY
     The implementation of zopen() function first appeared in NetBSD 1.6 and
     FreeBSD 4.5.  zdopen() first appeared in FreeBSD 13.0.  These functions
     may not be portable to systems other than FreeBSD.
