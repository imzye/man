JLog(3)               User Contributed Perl Documentation              JLog(3)


NAME
       JLog - Perl extension for the jlog journaled queueing system

DESCRIPTION
       Parent class for JLog::Reader and JLog::Writer.  You probably want to
       be looking at those instead.  JLog is a durable, reliable, publish-and-
       subscribe queueing system.

INTERFACE
   Subscriber Management
       A JLog must have subscribers to be functional.  Without a subscriber, a
       queue may be purged, as there are no interested readers.  For this
       reason it is highly recommended that you add a subscriber before
       writing to a log.

       add_subscriber

         $w->add_subscriber( $name, [ $flag ] );

       Add a subscriber to the JLog queue.

       $name
           The name of the subscriber.

       $flag
           An optional flag dictating where the subscriber should be marked
           interested from.  The default is JLog::JLOG_BEGIN.  The other
           available option is JLog::JLOG_END.

       remove_subscriber

         $w->remove_subscriber ( $name );

       Remove a subscriber to the JLog queue.

       $name
           The name of the subscriber.

       list_subscribers

         @subscribers = $w->list_subscribers;

       Return a list of all the subscribers to a JLog queue.

   Internals
       alter_journal_size

       This function is a stub provided for backwards compatibility. It will
       always return false.

       $size
           The desired size in bytes.

       raw_size

         $size = $w->raw_size;

       The size of the existing journal (including checkpointed but unpurged
       messages in the current journal file), in bytes.
