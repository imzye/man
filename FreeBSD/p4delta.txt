NAME
       p4delta - Summarize the differences between a Perforce project and
       local files.

SYNOPSIS
       p4delta [options] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Summarizes the differences between a Perforce project and local files,
       showing the changes of the files themselves and of their contents.
       Added, changed, and deleted files are denoted with `+', `*', and `-'
       respectively. The number of lines are displayed.

OPTIONS
       -c, --confirm
           Confirm deleted files with the user before removing them from
           Perforce. The default is simply to execute the remove command for
           relevant files. This option is valid only with the --execute
           option.

       -e, --execute
           Execute the associated Perforce commands ("add", "edit", and
           "remove") for the added, edited and deleted files.

       -f, --force
           Compare all local files against those in Perforce. The default is
           to compare only the local files that are opened.

       -h, --help
           Display a help message.

       -q, --quiet
           Run with minimum output.

       -v, --version
           Display the version and exit.

       -V, --verbose
           Run with maximum output.

ARGUMENTS
       Arguments may be either files or directories.

       File
           If a file is provided, it is compared against the equivalent in
           CVS, if any. The .cvsignore files are applied, so that although the
           file was explicitly provided, it may be ignored.

       Directory
           Directories are processed recursively for files that are not
           filtered out by .cvsignore files.

       File
           If a file is provided, it is compared against the equivalent in
           Perforce, if any. .p4ignore files are applied, so that although the
           file was explicitly provided, it may be ignored.

       Directory
           Directories are processed recursively for files that are not
           filtered out by .p4ignore files.

EXAMPLES
           % p4delta

       Lists the changed files.

           % p4delta --execute

       Lists the changed files, and executes the associated add, edit and
       remove commands.

           % p4delta --execute --confirm

       Add, edit and remove the appropriate files, but get confirmation from
       the user before removing any files.

ENVIRONMENT
       $HOME/.p4ignore, .../project/.p4ignore
           Files and directories may be filtered by .p4ignore files, locate
           both in the user's home directory and locally, in each directory.
           For example:

               *.bak
               *.class
               *.o
               *.out
               *~
               .libs
               logs
               core

           See http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs/doc/cvs_18.html#SEC170 for how
           this is used in CVS, from which this idea was taken.

       $HOME/.p4deltarc, .../project/.p4deltarc
           Resource files containing name/value pairs, separated by either ':'
           or '='. The valid fields of a .p4deltarc file are as follows, with
           their default values:

               quiet:   false
               verbose: false
               execute: false
               force:   false

           "yes" and "on" are synonymnous with "true". "no" and "off" signify
           "false".

           The values in the project .p4deltarc file will override those in
           the user's .p4deltarc file. The project .p4deltarc is searched from
           the current directory up through each parent directory that is in
           Perforce.

       P4DELTAOPTS
           A string of whitespace-delimited options, the same as listed above.
           These values override those of the resource files.

NOTES
       If a file exists in the Perforce project but not locally, it is assumed
       that the file has been deleted, not that it may have been recently
       added by another user. The --confirm option can be used to deal with
       this situation.
