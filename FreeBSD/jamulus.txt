DESCRIPTION
     Jamulus, a low-latency audio client and server, enables musicians to
     perform real-time “jam” sessions over the internet.  It is available
     across multiple platforms, so participants of any field can communicate
     without specialist setup requirements.  This is not restricted to music,
     of course; other use (perhaps conferencing?) is also possible.

     One participant starts Jamulus in Server mode, ideally on a dedicated
     server (virtual) machine; all participants start the (graphical) Client
     which transmits audio to the Server, receiving back a mixed stream.  Use
     of a metronome is recommended.  Clients should be connected using
     ethernet, not wireless, and use proper headphone and microphone
     connections, not Bluetooth.  The Server should run on a low-latency
     system, ideally not a VM.

     Running Jamulus without any extra options launches the full graphical
     Client.

     The options are as follows:

     -6 | --enableipv6
             enable IPv6 support

     -c | --connect address
             (Client mode only) connect to the given Server address
             (hostname[:port]) at startup

     -d | --discononquit
             (Server mode only) disconnect all Clients on quit

     -e | --directoryaddress hostname
             (Server mode only) Register the Server with the given Directory
             by setting the Directory Server Address to use to hostname; see
             also -o; to be a Directory Server, use “localhost”

     -F | --fastupdate
             (Server mode only) use 64 samples frame size mode, which reduces
             latency if Clients connect with “enable small network buffers”
             turned on; requires a faster CPU to avoid dropouts and uses more
             bandwidth to connected Clients

     --jsonrpcsecretfile file
             (Server mode only) Set the path to a text file containing an
             authentication string for obtaining access to the JSON-RPC API.
             This option is required when --jsonrpcport is used.

     --jsonrpcport port
             (Server mode only) Enables JSON-RPC API server to control the
             application, set the TCP port number.  This API is experimental
             and may change.  It is only accessible from localhost.  Please
             refer to the JSON-RPC API Documentation.

     -f | --listfilter filter
             (Directory mode only) whitelist which Servers are allowed to
             register on the server list; filter must consist of semicolon-
             separated IP addresses

     -h | -? | --help
             display a short help text and exit immediately

     -i | --inifile file
             (Client and non-headless Server mode only) override default
             initialisation file with file

     -j | --nojackconnect
             (Client mode only) do not automatically connect to JACK

     -L | --licence
             (Server mode only) require Clients to accept the agreement shown
             in the welcome message (use -w to set the text) before they are
             allowed joining

     -l | --log file
             (Server mode only) enable logging to file

     -M | --mutestream
             (Client mode only) start in muted state

     -m | --htmlstatus file
             (Server mode only) write Server status and list of connected
             Clients, in HTML format, to file periodically

     -n | --nogui
             disable the GUI

     -o | --serverinfo info
             (Registered Servers only) set Server location details, formatted
             as name;city;locale where locale is the numeric value of a
             QLocale; see https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qlocale.html#Country-enum for
             a list

     -P | --delaypan
             (Server mode only) start with delay panning enabled

     -p | --port number
             set the local UDP port to use to number (default: 22124)

     -Q | --qos value
             set QoS value (iptos byte) to use (default: 128)

     -R | --recording Directory
             (Server mode only) enable recording (but see --norecord) storing
             tracks in Directory

     -s | --server
             start in Server mode

     -T | --multithreading
             (Server mode only) use multithreading to make better use of
             multi-core CPUs and support more Clients

     -t | --notranslation
             disable translations, use built-in English strings

     -u | --numchannels
             (Server mode only) set maximum number of channels (and,
             therefore, users); default is 10, maximum is 150

     -v | --version
             display version information and exit immediately

     -w | --welcomemessage message
             (Server mode only) show message (may contain HTML and inline CSS)
             to users on connect

     -z | --startminimized
             (Server mode only) start with minimised window

     --centralserver hostname
             (Server mode only) deprecated alias for --directoryaddress

     --clientname name
             (Client mode only) set window title and JACK client name

     --ctrlmidich MIDISetup
             (Client mode only) set MIDI controller channel to listen on,
             control number offset and consecutive CC numbers (channels);
             format:
             channel[;foff*nchans][;poff*nchans][;soff*nchans][;moff*nchans]

             The first semicolon-separated element sets the MIDI channel
             Jamulus listens on for control messages.  The other elements
             specify the items to control by their first literal letter
             (f = volume fader, p = pan, m = mute, s = solo) directly followed
             by the offset (CC number) to start from, a literal asterisk, and
             the amount of consecutive CC numbers to assign.  Fader strips in
             the mixer window are controlled in ascending order from left to
             right.  Jamulus does not provide feedback as to the current state
             of the Solo and Mute buttons so the controller must track and
             signal their state locally.

     --directoryfile file
             (Directory mode only) remember registered Servers even if the
             Directory is restarted

     --mutemyown
             (headless Client only) mute my channel in my personal mix

     --norecord
             (Server mode only) do not automatically start recording even if
             configured with -R

     --serverbindip ip
             (Server mode only) configure Legacy IP address to bind to

     --serverpublicip ip
             (Server mode only) configure public legacy IP address when both
             the Directory Server and the actual Server are situated behind
             the same NAT, so that Clients can connect

     --showallservers
             (Client mode only) show all registered Servers in the serverlist
             regardless whether a ping to the Server is possible or not
             (debugging command)

     --showanalyzerconsole
             (Client mode only) show analyser console to debug network buffer
             properties (debugging command)

     Note that the debugging commands are not intended for general use.

     Jamulus knows four modes of operation: Client mode and three kinds of
     Server (Unregistered, Registered, Directory.) A Unregistered Server is
     unlisted, Clients can only connect if given the address (IP address and
     port).  A Registered Server will contact a Directory (whose address must
     be given at Server startup) and show up in that Server's list; Clients
     can retrieve a list of Registered Servers from the Directory Server.
     Several Registered Directories are operated by the Jamulus project; there
     is a Directory for each genre, which is how Registered Jamulus Servers
     are categorised into genres.
