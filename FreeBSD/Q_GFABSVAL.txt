Q_FRAWMASK(3)          FreeBSD Library Functions Manual          Q_FRAWMASK(3)

NAME
     Q_FRAWMASK, Q_GFRAW, Q_GFABSVAL, Q_GFVAL, Q_SFVAL – fixed-point math
     functions which manipulate the fractional data bits

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/qmath.h>

     ITYPE
     Q_FRAWMASK(QTYPE q);

     ITYPE
     Q_GFRAW(QTYPE q);

     ITYPE
     Q_GFABSVAL(QTYPE q);

     ITYPE
     Q_GFVAL(QTYPE q);

     QTYPE
     Q_SFVAL(QTYPE q, ITYPE fv);

DESCRIPTION
     Q_FRAWMASK() returns a q-specific bit mask for q's fractional data bits.

     Q_GFRAW() returns q's raw masked fractional data bits.

     Q_GFABSVAL() and Q_GFVAL() return the absolute and real values of q's
     fractional data bits respectively.

     Q_SFVAL() sets q's fractional data bits to the value fv.

     All of those functions operate on the following data types: s8q_t, u8q_t,
     s16q_t, u16q_t, s32q_t, u32q_t, s64q_t, and u64q_t, which are referred to
     generically as QTYPE.  The ITYPE refers to the stdint(7) integer types.

     For more details, see qmath(3).

RETURN VALUES
     Q_FRAWMASK(), Q_GFRAW(), Q_GFABSVAL() and Q_GFVAL() return their
     respective values as integers of the same underlying ITYPE as q.

     Q_SFVAL() returns the value of q post set.
