NAME
       Array::PrintCols - Print or format array elements in vertically sorted
       columns.

SYNOPSIS
       "use Array::PrintCols;"

       "print_cols \@array;"

       "print_cols \@array, $colspec;"

       "print_cols \@array, $colspec, $total_width;"

       "print_cols \@array, $colspec, $total_width, $indent;"

                    \@I<array> may also be an ARRAYREF, HASH, or HASHREF.

       $output = "format_cols" <same arguments as "print_cols">;

       "$Array::PrintCols::PreSorted = 0;"

DESCRIPTION
       This module exports two subroutine names: "print_cols" and
       "format_cols".

       The "print_cols" subroutine prints the items of "@array" in multiple,
       alphabetically & vertically sorted columns.  In the case of the first
       argument being a HASH or HASHREF, only the keys of the hash are
       considered.

       One, two, or three optional arguments may be given to "print_cols" to
       control the width and number of the columns, the total width of the
       output, and indentation.  Reasonable defaults apply in the absence of
       the optional arguments (or when given as the empty string or zero).
       Generally, the minimum width column is used when possible.

       If "$colspec" is given as a non-negative number, it is treated as the
       minimum width of the column; the actual width will be the maximum of
       this value and the lengths of all array items.

       If "$colspec" is given as a negative number, its absolute value value
       is used to determine the total number of columns.  However, it cannot
       exceed the total number of columns possible based on the maximum length
       of all the array elements.

       If a third argument is supplied, it is used as the total width of the
       output.  The default for this value is the value of the environment
       variable $ENV{'COLUMNS'}, if defined, or 80.

       If the fourth argument is given, it is used as the indent for all lines
       printed, which subtracts from the total width of the output.  This
       value defaults to zero (ie: no indention of the output).

       The variable $Array::PrintCols::PreSorted controls whether or not the
       "print_cols" subroutine will expect its array argument to already be
       sorted.  If this variable is nil or zero, "print_cols" will cause print
       out a sorted copy of the input array.

       The routine "format_cols" is called exactly like "print_cols" but
       returns the formatted result as a string, rather than printing it.
       "print_cols" actually invokes "format_cols", which does the real work.

EXAMPLES
           use Array::PrintCols;

           @commands = sort qw( use list put get set quit help server );

           # print in three columns with an indention of 1.
           print_cols \@commands, -3, 0, 1;

           # print the formatted result data to the result file
           print RESULTFILE format_cols(\@result_data);
