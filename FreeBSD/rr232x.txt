HPTRR(4)               FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual               HPTRR(4)

NAME
     hptrr – HighPoint RocketRAID device driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following line in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device hptrr
           device scbus
           device da

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           hptrr_load="YES"

     The following tunables are settable from the loader:

     hw.hptrr.attach_generic
     set to 1 to permit driver attach to chips with generic Marvell (non-
     HighPoint) PCI identification.  These chips are also supported by ata(4)
     and mvs(4).  Some vendors are using same chips, but without providing
     RAID BIOS.

DESCRIPTION
     The hptrr driver provides support for HighPoint's RocketRAID based RAID
     controllers.

     These devices support SATA/ATA disk drives and provide RAID0 (striping),
     RAID1 (mirroring), and RAID5 functionality.

HARDWARE
     The hptrr driver supports the following RAID controllers:

     •   RocketRAID 172x series
     •   RocketRAID 174x series
     •   RocketRAID 2210
     •   RocketRAID 222x series
     •   RocketRAID 2240
     •   RocketRAID 230x series
     •   RocketRAID 231x series
     •   RocketRAID 232x series
     •   RocketRAID 2340
     •   RocketRAID 2522

NOTES
     The hptrr driver only works on the i386 and amd64 platforms as it
     requires a binary blob object from the manufacturer which they only
     supply for these platforms.  The hptrr driver does not work on i386 with
     pae(4) enabled.

     This driver does not support the RR182x series controller.  See the
     hptmv(4) manual page for details on support.

     This driver supersedes the older rr232x driver.

SEE ALSO
     ata(4), cam(4), hptmv(4), mvs(4), loader(8)

HISTORY
     The hptrr device driver first appeared in FreeBSD 6.3.

AUTHORS
     The hptrr device driver was written by HighPoint Technologies, Inc., and
     ported to FreeBSD by Scott Long.  This manual page was written by David
     E. O'Brien.

BUGS
     The hptrr driver does not support manipulating the RAID from the OS,
     RAIDs need to be set up from the on-board BIOS.
