NAME
       Iodef::Pb - Perl extension for formatting an array of IODEFDocumentType
       (IODEF protocol buffer objects) messages into things like tab-delmited
       tables, csv and snort rules

SYNOPSIS
         use Iodef::Pb::Simple;
         use Iodef::Pb::Format;

         my $i = Iodef::Pb::Simple->new({
           address         => '1.2.3.4',
           confidence      => 50,
           severity        => 'high',
           restriction     => 'need-to-know',
           contact         => 'Wes Young',
           assessment      => 'botnet',
           description     => 'spyeye',
           alternativeid   => 'example2.com',
           id              => '1234',
           portlist        => '443,8080',
           protocol        => 'tcp',
           asn             => '1234',
         });

         my $ret = Iodef::Pb::Format->new({
           driver  => 'Table', # or 'Snort'
           data    => $i,
         });

         warn $ret;

DESCRIPTION
       This is a helper library for Iodef::Pb. It'll take a single (or array
       of) IODEFDocumentType messages and transform them to a number of
       different outputs (Table, Snort, etc).

   EXPORT
       None by default. Object Oriented.
