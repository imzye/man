DESCRIPTION
       XSkat lets you play the card game Skat as defined by the official Skat
       Order.

       Up to 3 players may be simulated by the computer.

       After starting the game a mouse click or ESC/F1 will bring up a menu.
       Other useful keys are: Space, Return, Tab, Cursor left/right/up/down.
       The rest of the game controls should be fairly obvious.

       An introduction to Skat can be found at
       http://www.xskat.de/xskat.html

       -dolog Turn on automatic logging (default file: $HOME/.xskat.log or
              ./xskat.log).

       -nolog Turn off automatic logging (default).  Logs of individual games
              may still be saved during the game.

              and boldface.

       -unfmt Write unformatted log files (default).

       -game filename

              Currently available: English and German (default:
              $LANG/$LANGUAGE is tried first. Then: see Imakefile/Makefile).

       -start number
              The player who starts dealing cards (default: 2).

       -s1 number
       -s2 number
       -s3 number

              the one and only computer in two player mode.
              s2 corresponds to the right computer in single player mode.
              s3 is only useful with -auto.
              The number must be between -4 (weak) and 0 (default).

       -ramsch
              Play a game of Ramsch when all players pass.
              The following rules are currently implemented:
              The Skat remains face down until it goes to the winner of the
              last trick (or to the loser of the game, s.b.).  The amount lost
              is the number of card points taken.  If two players tie for most
              card points, they both lose.  If all tie, the score is 0.  If
              one player takes no tricks (a virgin) the amount lost by the
              loser is doubled.  Someone taking all the tricks (forced march)
              wins 120 points.

       -noramsch
              Don't play Ramsch (default).

       -ramschonly
              Play Ramsch each game.

       -sramsch
              Play Schieberamsch instead of simple Ramsch.
              The rules are:
              Each player in turn, starting with Forehand, may pick up the
              Skat and discard two cards face down.  It's not allowed to pass
              on jacks.  The score is doubled each time a player doesn't pick
              up the Skat.

       -nosramsch
              Don't play Schieberamsch (default).

       -skattoloser
              At the end of a Ramsch game the Skat is awarded to the loser(s).
              This will increase the loss.

       -skattolast
              The Skat goes to the winner of the last trick (default).

       -kontra
              Allow opponents to say 'Kontra' which doubles the score of the
              game.  The Soloist may reply 'Re' to double the score again.

       -nokontra
              Disallow Kontra (default).

       -kontra18
              Only an opponent who said at least 18 may say 'Kontra'.

       -bock  Play a Bockround after some special event.  The score is doubled
              in the next 3 games.  If an event causing a new Bockround
              happens before the current Bockround is over or several
              Bockround events happen at the same time, the number of
              Bockrounds still to play is increased appropriately.

       -nobock
              Don't play Bockrounds (default).

       -bockramsch
              Play a round of compulsory Ramsch after each Bockround.  Before
              a game of Ramsch begins, each player in turn, starting with
              Forehand, may declare to play Grand Hand instead.  After a Grand
              Hand the same player deals again because this game does not
              count towards completing the Ramschround.

       -bockevents number
              Specify the events that cause a Bockround.
              (1) A game is lost with 60 points.
              (2) A successful Grand Hand.
              (4) A successful Kontra (opponents win).
              (8) A game with Kontra & Re.
              (16) A player's score ends in 3 equal digits.
              (32) A player's score is a multiple of 100.
              (64) A game value of +72 or more.
              (128) A game value of +96 or more.
              Add up the numbers in parentheses to specify the desired events
              (default: 0).
              Notes:
              A Kontra where the Soloist said Re but lost counts as one event
              not two (events 4 and 8).
              To check a player's score, the current listing options of
              player1 are used (events 16 and 32).  A score that is a multiple
              of 1000 counts as one event.
              The game value (events 64 and 128) is the normal value without
              considering any doubling caused by Ramsch, Kontra or Bock.

       -resumebock
              Resume unfinished Bockrounds after quitting and restarting
              XSkat.  The number of games to play is read from the game list
              file.

       -noresumebock
              Don't resume Bockrounds (default).

       -spitze
              Allow the Soloist to declare Spitze.  This means that the last
              trick must be made with the lowest trump to win the game.  This
              will be indicated to the other players by displaying the lowest
              trump.  The game multiplier is increased by 1.  It's not allowed
              to say Spitze in a Grand with 4 jacks.

       -spitze2
              Declaring Spitze increases the multiplier by 2.

       -nospitze
              Don't allow Spitze (default).

       -revolution
              Enable a special variation of Null ouvert.  After the Soloist's
              cards are exposed the opponents can look at each other's cards
              and rearrange the cards between their two hands in any way they
              wish before the start of the play.  Revolution is worth 92
              points.

       -norevolution
              Don't allow Revolution (default).

       -klopfen
              During a Ramschround you may knock (klopfen) at the beginning of
              a game to indicate that you think you won't lose.  This will
              double the score of the game.  Klopfen is not possible if you
              don't pick up the Skat in Schieberamsch.

       -noklopfen
              Don't allow Klopfen (default).

       -schenken
              If the opponents decide at the start of the play that they
              cannot defeat the Soloist, they can give up.  This is done by
              selecting Schenken from the main menu during the first trick
              when it's your turn.  If the Soloist accepts, the score is as
              though the game was won simply.  The Soloist can insist on
              playing on, but in that case has to make the opponents Schneider
              to win.  The score in this case is as for an announced Schneider
              (the multiplier is increased by 2).  If the Soloist goes on the
              opponents can schenken again, giving the Soloist the Schneider.
              The Soloist can accept Schneider or insist on playing on for
              Schwarz.

       -noschenken
              Don't allow Schenken (default).

       -hint  Put a mark over the card the computer would play.

       -nohint
              Don't show computer hints (default).

       -newrules
              Use the official rules of 01/01/1999:
              Lost Hand games count double.
              The Grand Ouvert multiplier is 24.
              (default)

       -oldrules
              Lost Hand games count simple.
              The Grand Ouvert multiplier is 36.

       -shortcut
              Always finish the game when the remaining tricks will all go to
              one side.

       -noshortcut
              Play each trick.

       -askshortcut
              Ask whether a shortcut should be taken (default).

       -irc   Play via Internet Relay Chat.  This option will establish a
              connection to an IRC server where you can join other people for
              a game of Skat.
              How it works:
              Start XSkat from an xterm. Wait until the server has printed the
              welcome message.  You are now on channel #xskat where new games
              should be planned.  Everything you type into the xterm will be
              sent to everyone else on this channel. After you have found one
              or two other players and agreed upon the name of a new channel
              (say #xskat123), you should type /join #xskat123.  When all
              players are on the new channel, exactly one player has to type
              /go (or /go2 if there are only 2 players) to start the game. Now
              you can play and talk.

       -noirc Don't use IRC (default).

       -irctelnet program
              Specify the program that will be used to connect to the IRC
              server.  If you are sitting behind a firewall, a program like
              rtelnet must be used and you may have to set $SOCKS_SERVER to
              the name of your firewall host (default: telnet).

       -ircserver host-name
              Select an IRC server near you! (default: $IRCSERVER or irc.fu-
              berlin.de, if not changed in the Imakefile/Makefile)

       -ircport number
              The port of the IRC server to connect to (default: $IRCPORT or
              6667).

       -ircchannel name
              The channel to join initially (default: #xskat).

       -ircnick name
              Your IRC nickname. If your nick is already used by someone else,
              a different nick will be generated automatically.  Some servers
              allow a nick length of 30, others limit it to 9 characters.
              (default: $IRCNICK or $IRCUSER or $LOGNAME or xskatNNNN).

       -ircuser name
              Your user/login name. Note: most servers don't like faked user
              names (default: $IRCUSER or $LOGNAME).

       -ircrealname name
              Your real name (default: $IRCNAME or the entry from the passwd
              file or 'XSkat player').

       -ircpos number
              Select your position relative to the other players. Positions
              are numbered clockwise 1, 2 and 3. Player 2 will start dealing
              if not specified otherwise with -start or /start.  If you don't
              specify your position or there is a conflict with someone else's
              choice or you give an invalid number (3 in a 2 player game),
              this will be fixed automatically. Choosing the right positions
              is important if you want to continue with a saved game list
              (default: 0 = I don't care).

       -irclog file
              Everything sent to or received from the IRC server is saved to
              this file (- means stdout).  It may be useful for debugging
              (default: $HOME/.xskat.ilg or ./xskat.ilg).

       -irclogappend
              Append output to the log file.

       -irclogoverwrite
              Overwrite existing log file (default).

       IRC commands:
              /nick name, /nick - change or display your nickname.
              /who - is on the current channel ?
              /list, /list string - show all channels that match the word
              xskat or the specified string.  This will take some time on
              networks with a large number of channels.  Trying to stop the
              listing will terminate the program.
              /pos number - see -ircpos.
              /bell - toggle the alarm bell. When on, the bell will ring each
              time someone joins your channel or sends a message to you.  The
              bell is off initially.
              /quit - terminate XSkat.
              /sync - if messages get lost due to a net-split (or because
              someone left the channel during play), XSkat will detect this
              and in most cases should be able to synchronize automatically
              (within 30 seconds) after the connection is reestablished.
              Typing /sync will try this immediately.
              /quote command args - for those who know what they are doing.
              The following commands are only useful for the player who will
              start the game by typing /go because that player will determine
              the rules of the game.
              /default - set the official rules.
              /ramsch, /sramsch, /skattoloser, /kontra, /bock, /resumebock,
              /spitze, /revolution, /klopfen, /schenken, /oldrules,
              /bockevents, /alist, /tlist, /start, /s1 - change the rules of
              the game.  All of these require an argument (a number or
              True/False) just like the resources with the same name.
              /rules - show the current rules to everyone on your channel.

       Notes: The version numbers of all participating programs must be equal.
              Most options cannot be changed during the game.  Options that
              can be changed are not saved to a file.
              The game list can only be cleared during bidding or when it's
              your turn to play a card.  There is a different default game
              list for IRC games (see -list).
              It's possible to type into the xterm or the game window (which
              is recommended), but changing input sources in the middle of a
              line won't work.
              If you want better input line editing and a split screen try the
              program ssfe.  It is used like this: ssfe -raw xskat -irc
              You can omit -irc when you specify any of the other IRC options.

       -auto #ofgames
              Three computers play the specified number of games without human
              interaction.  The resulting scores are printed.
              With this option, no resources are read, and the game list is
              saved only if -list is specified.

       -opt filename
              The file for saving/restoring all interactively changeable
              options of all players (default: $HOME/.xskat.opt or
              ./xskat.opt).  Command line options take precedence over options
              specified in this file which in turn override resource
              specifications.  This may be changed with the useoptfile
              resource.

       -pk    If you want the computer to deal a Good Hand every time.  (as
              requested by Petra K.)  Alternatively, pressing F6 three times
              will result in a Good Hand for the next game.  Does not work in
              multiplayer mode.

       player@display
              Specifies the display of the second and third player (but is
              ignored for IRC games).  The player@ part may be omitted if the
              alias resource is set on display.

              multiplayer mode (but not for IRC).  It is ignored for player1.
              If set to True, the contents of the option file, which is owned
              by player1, are used.  This means that you may end up with
              someone else's preferred settings if player1 used this file in a
              different multiplayer game.

       alias  The player's real name (max. 2 words of 9 characters, default:
              $LOGNAME).

       Only player1 may specify the resources marked with (#).

       Filenames starting with ~/ are interpreted correctly if HOME is set.

FILES
       An example of a file specifying predefined games:

       # The following block specifies the distribution
       # of cards for player1, 2, 3 and Skat(0).
       # A 10  K  Q  J  9  8  7
         2  2  2  2  2  0  3  3  # Diamond
         2  2  2  2  2  3  3  3  # Heart
         1  1  1  1  1  3  3  3  # Spade
         1  1  1  1  1  0  3  3  # Club
       # The following is not the same game !
       # Player numbers rotate 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3
       # (and depend on the start option).
         2  2  2  2  2  0  3  3
         2  2  2  2  2  3  3  3

         1  1  1  1  1  0  3  3
       repeat
       # Repeat the above games forever.
       # The following lines take effect only
       # when you delete the 'repeat'.
       random_seed 123456 0 2
       # Specifies the random number which determines
       # card distribution for all following games.
       # The second number lets you skip that many
       # games in the sequence.
       # The third (optional) number defines
       # who will start dealing cards (see -start).
       # An additional L or R following this number will
       # rotate the cards left or right.
       # The random_seed will be shown in game logs
       # to allow easy replay. Just type:
       # echo random_seed 123456 0 2 | xskat -game -

NOTES
       There are no official rules for the variations Ramsch, Kontra, Bock,
       Spitze, Revolution, Klopfen and Schenken.

       If executing xskat player@otherhost:0 on yourhost gives an error
       message you could try the command xhost yourhost on otherhost to grant
       yourhost access to otherhost's  display.

       If you replay a game with your own cards, it doesn't matter whether
       'Forehand changes' is set to 'yes' or 'no'.

       Some versions of telnet have a bug, that prevents them from reading
       input from a pipe correctly.  See README.IRC for a fix or put this into
       your ~/.telnetrc:

       irc.fu-berlin.de
        set echo off
        set escape off
        set rlogin off
        set flushoutput off
        set interrupt off
        set quit off
        set eof off
        set erase off
        set kill off
        set lnext off
        set susp off
        set reprint off
        set worderase off
        set start off
        set stop off
        set forw1 off
        set forw2 off
        set ayt off

       Leading blanks are important!  Change the irc server line
       appropriately.
