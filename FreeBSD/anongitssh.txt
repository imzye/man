ANONGITSSH(1)           FreeBSD General Commands Manual          ANONGITSSH(1)

NAME
     anongitssh – restricted shell for git-upload-pack over SSH

SYNOPSIS
     anongitssh -c git-upload-pack repodir

DESCRIPTION
     The anongitssh utility is a restricted shell which invokes
     git-upload-pack(1) utility included in the git(1) suite.  It is designed
     to be a non-interactive login shell of a user on the system which accepts
     read-only remote access via SSH protocol.

     The anongitssh has a database of login names, git(1) repository prefixes,
     and chroot(8) directories which is configurable at compile time.  When
     the anongitssh is invoked as a login shell, it will check validity of the
     login name and the uid using the database, do chroot(8) to the directory
     specified in the database, prepend a prefix to the pathname specified in
     repodir, and finally invoke git-upload-pack with the complete pathname
     for the repository.

     All of the option flags passed from the client and environment variables
     will be removed.  When an invalid access is detected, a predefined
     message will be sent to the client.

LOGGING
     The anongitssh records all of the access via syslog(3) API.
