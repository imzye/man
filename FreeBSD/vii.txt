vii(1)                  FreeBSD General Commands Manual                 vii(1)

NAME
       vii - buffer and display output

SYNOPSIS
       vii [ option...  ]
       vii -Help
       vii -VERSion

DESCRIPTION
       The vii command accepts input from the standard input and displays
       pages of the input on the crt.  These pages are delimited by form-feeds
       (or EOF) and only as much as will fit on the screen will be displayed.

       The vii command can also repeatedly execute a command, and the most
       recent output is displayed.

OPTIONS
       The following options are understood:

       -Execute string
               The given string is executed.  The command should be in quotes.

       -Interval number
               Commands executed with the -Execute option will be reexecuted
               after the given interval in seconds.

       -Terminal string
               Use the terminal type given, rather than the type given in the
               TERM environment variable.

       -Help   Display some help on how to used the vii(1) command.

       -VERSion
               Display the versin of the vii(1) command.

               See the file man/man1/o__rules.so.


COMMANDS
       The following commands may be used to navigate the displayed text

       q Q     Quit out of vii(1).  As much of possible of the display is
               preserved.  The interrupt key (usually ^C) will also cause
               vii(1) to quit.

       ^L ^R   Redraw the screen.  This can be useful if a background process
               has overwritten the display.

       j ^E CR Scroll down one line.

       k ^Y    Scroll up one line.

       J ^F SP Scroll down one screen of text.

       K ^B    Scroll up one screen of text.

       c C ^C  Show the date and time in the top right corner of the screen.

       t T ^T  Show the time in the top right corner of the screen.

       d D ^D  Show the date in the top right corner of the screen.

       p P ^P  Show the line position in the top right corner of the screen.

EXAMPLES
       To display the process state every 15 seconds,
        use the following command:
              vii -e "ps axu" -i 15
       If your shell does not have aliases, this shell script will do much the
       same thing:
              #!/bin/sh
              while :
              do
                      ps axu
                      echo | tr '\12' '\14'
                      sleep 15
              done | vii
       If you don't have a Berkeley style ps(1) command, you will need to
       supply options as appropriate.
