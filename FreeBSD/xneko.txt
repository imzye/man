NAME
       xneko - cat-and-mouse chase in an X window

SYNOPSIS
       xneko [ -display display ] [ -geometry geometry ] [ -title title ] [
       -name name ] [ -iconic ] [ -speed speed ] [ -time time ] [ -help ]

DESCRIPTION
       Xneko displays a window in which a cat chases your "mouse" cursor.  Try
       moving the mouse inside and outside the xneko window, leaving it
       stationary, moving it slowly and quickly, etc., and watch the cat
       respond.

       All options except the last three above behave in the standard manner
       for X applications (see X(1)).  The -speed option controls the speed of
       the cat (the default is 16).  The -time option controls the interval
       (in microseconds) between updates of the xneko window (the default is
       125000).  The -help option provides a usage message and exits.

       The program was originally written by a Japanese author as a Macintosh
       desktop accessory (The word "neko" means "cat" in Japanese).
