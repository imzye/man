NAME
     freebee – Free Bee spelling bee game

SYNOPSIS
     freebee

DESCRIPTION
     freebee is a game where the player creates anagrams.  The goal of freebee
     is to make as many words as possible with the seven provided letters.
     The player does not have to use every letter and can use letters more
     than once.  The only requirements are that the center letter must be used
     at least once in every word and words must be at least four letters long.

     Four letter words are worth one point.  Words longer than four letters
     are worth one point per letter.  Pangrams, words that use all seven
     letters, are worth one point per letter plus an additional seven points.
     All games have at least one pangram and many games have multiple.

     The game is won when enough points are earned to become the Queen Bee.

     There are two types of games, daily and random.  Daily games are updated
     once per day and are downloaded from the Free Bee website at
     https://freebee.fun. Random games are generated on-the-fly whenever
     desired.
