END(3)                 FreeBSD Library Functions Manual                 END(3)

NAME
     end, etext, edata – end boundaries of image segments

SYNOPSIS
     extern end;
     extern etext;
     extern edata;

DESCRIPTION
     The globals end, etext and edata are program segment end addresses.

     etext is the first address after the end of the text segment.

     edata is the first address after the end of the initialized data segment.

     end is the first address after the end of the data segment (BSS) when the
     program is loaded.  Use the sbrk(2) system call with zero as its argument
     to find the current end of the data segment.

SEE ALSO
     sbrk(2), malloc(3), a.out(5)

HISTORY
     An end manual page appeared in Version 6 AT&T UNIX.

BUGS
     Traditionally, no variable existed that pointed to the start of the text
     segment because the text segment always started at address zero.
     Although it is no longer valid to make this assumption, no variable
     similar to the ones documented above exists to point to the start of the
     text segment.
