NAME
       Class::Hook - Add hooks on methods from other classes

SYNOPSIS
         use Class::Hook;

         Class::Hook->before(\&sub1);
         Class::Hook->after(\&sub2);
         Class::Hook->activate();
         # or
         Class::Hook->new(\&sub1, \&sub2);

         # and then
         Anotherclass->aMethod($someParam); # Hooked class

DESCRIPTION
       Class::Hook enables you to trace methods calls from your code to other
       classes.

       Instead of putting 'use Foo;' in your code, simply type 'use
       Class::Hook;'.  The class Foo is unknown in your code.  It will be
       magically caught by Class::Hook which will call Foo itself.  You can
       see Class::Hook as a kind of relay.

       You can setup a subroutine to be called before any call to
       "<Foo->amethod"> and a subroutine to be called after the call. Your
       subs will receive all the information that "<Foo->amethod"> will
       receive, so you can trace everything between your code and Foo.

METHODS
   new($subref_before, $subref_after, $param)
       Install subroutines to be called whenever a method from an unknown
       class is called. It is equivalent to the following code:

         Class::Hook->before($subref_before, $param);
         Class::Hook->after($subref_after, $param);
         Class::Hook->activate();

   before($subref, $param)
       Install subroutine to be called whenever a call to an unknown class is
       made.  $param will be sent to your $subref if specified &$subref will
       receive the following parameters:

         ( $param, { class   => $class_or_object,
                     method  => $method_called,
                     param   => [@params_sent],
                     counter => $no_calls_for_this_method } )
       or the following parameters if $param undefined

         ({ class   => $class_or_object,
            method  => $method_called,
            param   => [@params_sent],
            counter => $no_calls_for_this_method } )

   after($subref, $param)
       Install subroutine to be called whenever a call to an unknown class
       returns.  $param will be sent to your $subref if specified. &$subref
       will receive the following parameters

         ( $param, { class    => $class_or_object,
                     method   => $method_called,
                     param    => [@params_sent],
                     counter  => $no_calls_for_this_method,
                     'return' => [@return_values],
                     duration => $duration in seconds } )
       or the following parameters if $param undefined

         ( { class    => $class_or_object,
             method   => $method_called,
             param    => [@params_sent],
             counter  => $no_calls_for_this_method,
             'return' => [@return_values],
             duration => $duration in seconds } )

   activate()
       Activates the hooks on methods calls to unknown classes. Your subs
       "before" and "after" will be called at each call to an unknown package.

   deactivate()
       Stops hooks.

EXAMPLES
         You want to study calls to a class 'Foo'
         ========================================
         main.pl
         =======
         # Don't write 'use Foo;'!
         use Data::Dumper;
         use Class::Hook;
         Class::Hook->new(\&mybefore, \&myafter);

         Foo->new('bla', 'blu');
         Foo->bar( { key1 => 'value1',
                     key2 => 'value2'} );
         Foo->xxxx(); # Non existing method

         sub mybefore {
             print "Before called: ".Dumper(\@_);
         }

         sub myafter {
             print "After called: ".Dumper(\@_);
         }


         Foo.pm
         ======
         package Foo;
         sub new {
             my ($class, @param) = @_;
             warn "Foo->new called";
             return bless { 'something' => 'whatever',
                            'init'      => \@param }
                            => $class;
         }

         sub bar {
             warn "Foo->bar called";
             return "Hello from bar";
         }

         1;

CAVEATS
       It works only with method calls, not with subroutine calls.
       Foo->method will work Foo::method will NOT work.  UNIVERSAL::AUTOLOAD
       is overriden after Class::Hook->activate() has been called. Expect some
       strange behaviors if the module you use plays with it.

BUGS
       Don't rely on it for production purpose.  Has been tested on perl 5.6.0
       only and probably will need some update with later perl versions.
