FWIP(4)                FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                FWIP(4)

NAME
     fwip – IP over FireWire driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device firewire
           device fwip

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following lines in loader.conf(5):

           firewire_load="YES"
           if_fwip_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The fwip driver provides standard IP over FireWire (IEEE 1394) based on
     the protocols described in RFC 2734 and RFC 3146.

     The firewire(4) and fwohci(4) drivers must be configured in the kernel as
     well.

     This driver supports polling(4) as well if it is compiled with the
     DEVICE_POLLING option.

SEE ALSO
     arp(4), firewire(4), fwe(4), fwohci(4), netintro(4), polling(4),
     ifconfig(8), kldload(8), sysctl(8)

HISTORY
     The fwip device driver first appeared in FreeBSD 5.3.

AUTHORS
     The fwip driver and this manual page were written by Doug Rabson, based
     on earlier work by Hidetoshi Shimokawa.

BUGS
     This driver currently does not support the MCAP protocol for multicast IP
     over FireWire.  Multicast packets are treated as broadcast packets which
     is sufficient for most trivial uses of multicast.
