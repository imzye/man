PSTACK(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              PSTACK(1)

NAME
     pstack – get stack traces of threads in a running process

SYNOPSIS
     pstack [-a arg-count] [-e executable-file] [-f frame-count] [-o] [-O]
            [-t] [-v] pid | core
     pstack [-d elf-file]

DESCRIPTION
     Displays the stack traces of each thread in the running process with
     process id pid or from the core file core

     Options are as follows:

     -a arg-count
                 Attempt to read arg-count word-size arguments from the stack
                 for each frame.

     -f frame-count
                 Do not attempt to read any more than frame-count stack frames
                 for each stack.

     -d elf-file
                 Causes pstack to print a dump of the ELF information in an
                 object file, and exit.

     -e file     Specify an alternate executable to use for locating symbols
                 in the process.  This is useful if the process was started
                 from a stripped version of an executable, and you have the
                 unstripped version available. If examining a corefile, this
                 argument is required.

     -o          For each stack frame, display the name of the object in which
                 the current function lies

     -O          For each stack frame, display the full path to the object in
                 which the current function lies

     -t          Display the amount of time that the process was suspended by
                 pstack

     -v          verbose. Display debugging and diagnostics.

BUGS
     pstack works only for x86 32/64-bit ELF executables at the moment. (ie,
     no a.out support, and no Alpha support).  It is also very dependent on
     the current FreeBSD threads implementation.
