NAME
       ascii2uni - convert 7-bit ASCII representations to UTF-8 Unicode

SYNOPSIS
       ascii2uni [options] (<input file name>)

DESCRIPTION
       ascii2uni converts various 7-bit ASCII representations to UTF-8.  It
       reads from the standard input and writes to the standard output. The
       representations understood are listed below under the command line
       options. If no format is specified, standard hexadecimal format (e.g.
       0x00e9) is assumed.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
       -a <format> Convert from the specified format. Formats may be specified
       by means of the following arbitrary single character codes, by means of
       names such as "SGML_decimal", and by examples of the desired format.

              A Convert hexadecimal numbers with prefix U in angle-brackets
              (<U00E9>).

              B Convert \x-escaped hex (e.g. \x00E9)

              C Convert \x escaped hexadecimal numbers in braces (e.g.
              \x{00E9}).

              D Convert decimal HTML numeric character references (e.g.
              &#0233;)

              E Convert hexadecimal with prefix U (U00E9).

              F Convert hexadecimal with prefix u (u00E9).

              G Convert hexadecimal in single quotes with prefix X (e.g.
              X'00E9').

              H Convert hexadecimal HTML numeric character references (e.g.
              &#x00E9;)

              I Convert hexadecimal UTF-8 with each byte's hex preceded by an
              =-sign (e.g. =C3=A9) . This is the Quoted Printable format
              defined by RFC 2045.

              J Convert hexadecimal UTF-8 with each byte's hex preceded by a
              %-sign (e.g.  %C3%A9). This is the URIescape format defined by
              RFC 2396.

              K Convert octal UTF-8 with each byte escaped by a backslash
              (e.g.  \303\251)

              L Convert \U followed by eight hex digits or \u followed by four
              hex digits. \UXXXXXXXX encoding a character within the BMP
              (U+0000-U+FFFF) is converted but a warning is issued since this
              violates the WWW specification.

              M Convert hexadecimal SGML numeric character references (e.g.
              \#xE9;)

              N Convert decimal SGML numeric character references (e.g.
              \#233;)

              O Convert octal escapes for the three low bytes in big-endian
              order(e.g. \000\000\351))

              P Convert hexadecimal numbers with prefix U+ (e.g. U+00E9)

              Q Convert HTML character entities (e.g. &eacute;).

              R Convert raw hexadecimal numbers (e.g. 00E9). Requires the -p
              flag.

              S Convert hexadecimal escapes for the three low bytes in big-
              endian order (e.g. \x00\x00\xE9)

              T Convert decimal escapes for the three low bytes in big-endian
              order (e.g. \d000\d000\d233)

              U Convert \u-escaped hexadecimal numbers (e.g. \u00E9).

              V Convert \u-escaped decimal numbers (e.g. \u00233).

              X Convert standard hexadecimal numbers (e.g. 0x00E9).

              Y Convert all three types of HTML escape: hexadecimal and
              decimal character references and character entities.

              0 Convert hexadecimal UTF-8 with each byte's hex enclosed within
              angle brackets (e.g.  <C3><A9>).

              1 Convert Common Lisp format hexadecimal numbers (e.g. #x00E9).

              2 Convert Perl format decimal numbers with prefix v (e.g. v233).

              3 Convert hexadecimal numbers with prefix $ (e.g. $00E9).

              4 Convert Postscript format hexadecimal numbers with prefix 16#
              (e.g. 16#00E9).

              5 Convert Common Lisp format hexadecimal numbers with prefix
              #16r (e.g. #16r00E9).

              6 Convert ADA format hexadecimal numbers with prefix 16# and
              suffix # (e.g. 16#00E9#).

              7 Convert Apache log format hexadecimal UTF-8 with each byte's
              hex preceded by a backslash-x (e.g.  \xC3\xA9).

              8 Convert Microsoft OOXML format hexadecimal numbers with prefix
              _x and suffix _ (e.g. _x00E9_).

              9 Convert %\u-escaped hexadecimal numbers (e.g. %\u00E9).

       -h     Help. Print the usage message and exit.

       -v     Print program version information and exit.

       -m     Accept deprecated HTML entities lacking final semicolon, e.g.
              "&#x00E9" in place of "&#x00E9;".

       -p     Pure. Assume that the input consists entirely of escapes except
              for arbitrary (but non-null) amounts of separating whitespace.

       -q     Be quiet. Do not chat unnecessarily.


       -Z <format>
              Convert input using the supplied format. The format specified
              will be used as the format string in a call to sscanf(3) with a
              single argument consisting of a pointer to an unsigned long
              integer. For example, to obtain the same results as with the -U
              flag, the format would be: \u%04X.

       If the format is Quoted-Printable, although it is not strictly speaking
       conversion of an ASCII escape to Unicode, in accordance with RFC 2045,
       if an equal-sign occurs at the end of an input line, both the equal-
       sign and the immediately following newline are skipped.

       All options that accept hexadecimal input recognize both upper- and
       lower-case hexadecimal digits.


EXIT STATUS
       The following values are returned on exit:


       0 SUCCESS
              The input was successfully converted.


       3 INFO The user requested information such as the version number or
              usage synopsis and this has been provided.


       5 BAD OPTION
              An incorrect option flag was given on the command line.


       7 OUT OF MEMORY
              Additional memory was unsuccessfully requested.


       8 BAD RECORD
              An ill-formed record was detected in the input.
