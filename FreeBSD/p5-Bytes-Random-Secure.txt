Bytes::Random::Secure(3)                   User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Bytes::Random::Secure - Perl extension to generate
       cryptographically-secure random bytes.

SYNOPSIS
           use Bytes::Random::Secure qw(
               random_bytes random_bytes_base64 random_bytes_hex
           );

           my $bytes = random_bytes(32); # A string of 32 random bytes.

           my $bytes = random_string_from( 'abcde', 10 ); # 10 random a,b,c,d, and e's.

           my $bytes_as_base64 = random_bytes_base64(57); # Base64 encoded rand bytes.

           my $bytes_as_hex = random_bytes_hex(8); # Eight random bytes as hex digits.

           my $bytes_as_quoted_printable = random_bytes_qp(100); # QP encoded bytes.


           my $random = Bytes::Random::Secure->new(
               Bits        => 64,
               NonBlocking => 1,
           ); # Seed with 64 bits, and use /dev/urandom (or other non-blocking).

           my $bytes = $random->bytes(32); # A string of 32 random bytes.
           my $long  = $random->irand;     # 32-bit random integer.

DESCRIPTION
       Bytes::Random::Secure provides two interfaces for obtaining crypto-
       quality random bytes.  The simple interface is built around plain
       functions.  For greater control over the Random Number Generator's
       seeding, there is an Object Oriented interface that provides much more
       flexibility.

       The "functions" interface provides functions that can be used any time
       you need a string of a specific number of random bytes.  The random
       bytes are available as simple strings, or as hex-digits, Quoted
       Printable, or MIME Base64.  There are equivalent methods available from
       the OO interface, plus a few others.

       This module can be a drop-in replacement for Bytes::Random, with the
       primary enhancement of using a cryptographic-quality random number
       generator to create the random data.  The "random_bytes" function
       emulates the user interface of Bytes::Random's function by the same
       name.  But with Bytes::Random::Secure the random number generator comes
       from Math::Random::ISAAC, and is suitable for cryptographic purposes.
       The harder problem to solve is how to seed the generator.  This module
       uses Crypt::Random::Seed to generate the initial seeds for
       Math::Random::ISAAC.

       In addition to providing random_bytes(), this module also provides
       several functions not found in Bytes::Random: "random_string_from",
       random_bytes_base64(), "random_bytes_hex", and "random_bytes_qp".

       And finally, for those who need finer control over how
       Crypt::Random::Seed generates its seed, there is an object oriented
       interface with a constructor that facilitates configuring the seeding
       process, while providing methods that do everything the "functions"
       interface can do (truth be told, the functions interface is just a thin
       wrapper around the OO version, with some sane defaults selected).  The
       OO interface also provides an "irand" method, not available through the
       functions interface.

RATIONALE
       There are many uses for cryptographic quality randomness.  This module
       aims to provide a generalized tool that can fit into many applications
       while providing a minimal dependency chain, and a user interface that
       is simple.  You're free to come up with your own use-cases, but there
       are several obvious ones:

       •   Creating temporary passphrases (random_string_from()).

       •   Generating per-account random salt to be hashed along with
           passphrases (and stored alongside them) to prevent rainbow table
           attacks.

       •   Generating a secret that can be hashed along with a cookie's
           session content to prevent cookie forgeries.

       •   Building raw cryptographic-quality pseudo-random data sets for
           testing or sampling.

       •   Feeding secure key-gen utilities.

       Why use this module?  This module employs several well-designed CPAN
       tools to first generate a strong random seed, and then to instantiate a
       high quality random number generator based on the seed.  The code in
       this module really just glues together the building blocks.  However,
       it has taken a good deal of research to come up with what I feel is a
       strong tool-chain that isn't going to fall back to a weak state on some
       systems.  The interface is designed with simplicity in mind, to
       minimize the potential for misconfiguration.

EXPORTS
       By default "random_bytes" is the only function exported.  Optionally
       "random_string_from", "random_bytes_base64", "random_bytes_hex", and
       "random_bytes_qp" may be exported.

FUNCTIONS
       The functions interface seeds the ISAAC generator on first use with a
       256 bit seed that uses Crypt::Random::Seed's default configuration as a
       strong random seed source.

   random_bytes
           my $random_bytes = random_bytes( 512 );

       Returns a string containing as many random bytes as requested.
       Obviously the string isn't useful for display, as it can contain any
       byte value from 0 through 255.

       The parameter is a byte-count, and must be an integer greater or equal
       to zero.

   random_string_from
           my $random_bytes = random_string_from( $bag, $length );
           my $random_bytes = random_string_from( 'abc', 50 );

       $bag is a string of characters from which "random_string_from" may
       choose in building a random string.  We call it a 'bag', because it's
       permissible to have repeated chars in the bag (if not, we could call it
       a set).  Repeated digits get more weight.  For example,
       "random_string_from( 'aab', 1 )" would have a 66.67% chance of
       returning an 'a', and a 33.33% chance of returning a 'b'.  For
       unweighted distribution, ensure there are no duplicates in $bag.

       This isn't a "draw and discard", or a permutation algorithm; each
       character selected is independent of previous or subsequent selections;
       duplicate selections are possible by design.

       Return value is a string of size $length, of characters chosen at
       random from the 'bag' string.

       It is perfectly legal to pass a Unicode string as the "bag", and in
       that case, the yield will include Unicode characters selected from
       those passed in via the bag string.

       This function is useful for random string generation such as temporary
       random passwords.

   random_bytes_base64
           my $random_bytes_b64           = random_bytes_base64( $num_bytes );
           my $random_bytes_b64_formatted = random_bytes_base64( $num_bytes, $eol );

       Returns a MIME Base64 encoding of a string of $number_of_bytes random
       bytes.  Note, it should be obvious, but is worth mentioning that a
       base64 encoding of base256 data requires more digits to represent the
       bytes requested.  The actual number of digits required, including
       padding is 4(n/3).  Furthermore, the Base64 standard is to add padding
       to the end of any string for which "length % 57" is a non-zero value.

       If an $eol is specified, the character(s) specified will be used as
       line delimiters after every 76th character.  The default is "qq{\n}".
       If you wish to eliminate line-break insertions, specify an empty
       string: "q{}".

   random_bytes_hex
           my $random_bytes_as_hex = random_bytes_hex( $num_bytes );

       Returns a string of hex digits representing the string of
       $number_of_bytes random bytes.

       It's worth mentioning that a hex (base16) representation of base256
       data requires two digits for every byte requested. So "length(
       random_bytes_hex( 16 ) )" will return 32, as it takes 32 hex digits to
       represent 16 bytes.  Simple stuff, but better to mention it now than
       forget and set a database field that's too narrow.

   random_bytes_qp
           my $random_bytes_qp           = random_bytes_qp( $num_bytes );
           my $random_bytes_qp_formatted = random_bytes_qp( $num_bytes, $eol );

       Produces a string of $num_bytes random bytes, using MIME Quoted
       Printable encoding (as produced by MIME::QuotedPrint's "encode_qp"
       function.  The default configuration uses "\n" as a line break after
       every 76 characters, and the "binmode" setting is used to guarantee a
       lossless round trip.  If no line break is wanted, pass an empty string
       as $eol.

METHODS
       The Object Oriented interface provides methods that mirror the
       "functions" interface.  However, the OO interface offers the advantage
       that the user can control how many bits of entropy are used in seeding,
       and even how Crypt::Random::Seed is configured.

   new
           my $random = Bytes::Random::Secure->new( Bits => 512 );
           my $bytes  = $random->bytes( 32 );

       The constructor is used to specify how the ISAAC generator is seeded.
       Future versions may also allow for alternate CSPRNGs to be selected.
       If no parameters are passed the default configuration specifies 256
       bits for the seed.  The rest of the default configuration accepts the
       Crypt::Random::Seed defaults, which favor the strongest operating
       system provided entropy source, which in many cases may be "blocking".

       CONSTRUCTOR PARAMETERS

       Bits

           my $random = Bytes::Random::Secure->new( Bits => 128 );

       The "Bits" parameter specifies how many bits (rounded up to nearest
       multiple of 32) will be used in seeding the ISAAC random number
       generator.  The default is 256 bits of entropy.  But in some cases it
       may not be necessary, or even wise to pull so many bits of entropy out
       of "/dev/random" (a blocking source).

       Any value between 64 and 8192 will be accepted. If an out-of-range
       value is specified, or a value that is not a multiple of 32, a warning
       will be generated and the parameter will be rounded up to the nearest
       multiple of 32 within the range of 64 through 8192 bits.  So if 16384
       is specified, you will get 8192.  If 33 is specified, you will get 64.

       Note: In the Perlish spirit of "no arbitrary limits", the maximum
       number of bits this module accepts is 8192, which is the maximum number
       that ISAAC can utilize.  But just because you can specify a seed of
       8192 bits doesn't mean you ought to, much less need to.  And if you do,
       you probably want to use the "NonBlocking" option, discussed below.
       8192 bits is a lot to ask from a blocking source such as "/dev/random",
       and really anything beyond 512 bits in the seed is probably wasteful.

       PRNG

       Reserved for future use.  Eventually the user will be able to select
       other RNGs aside from Math::Random::ISAAC.

       Unique

       Reserved for future use.

       Other Crypt::Random::Seed Configuration Parameters

       For additional seeding control, refer to the POD for
       Crypt::Random::Seed.  By supplying a Crypt::Random::Seed parameter to
       Bytes::Random::Secure's constructor, it will be passed through to
       Crypt::Random::Seed.  For example:

           my $random = Bytes::Random::Secure->new( NonBlocking => 1, Bits => 64 );

       In this example, "Bits" is used internally, while "NonBlocking" is
       passed through to Crypt::Random::Seed.

   bytes
           my $random_bytes = $random->bytes(1024);

       This works just like the "random_bytes" function.

   string_from
           my $random_string = $random->string_from( 'abcdefg', 10 );

       Just like "random_string_from": Returns a string of random octets
       selected from the "Bag" string (in this case ten octets from
       'abcdefg').

   bytes_hex
           my $random_hex = $random->bytes_hex(12);

       Identical in function to "random_bytes_hex".

   bytes_base64
           my $random_base64 = $random->bytes_base64( 32, EOL => "\n" );

       Identical in function to "random_bytes_base64".

   bytes_qp
           my $random_qp = $random->bytes_qp( 80 );

       You guessed it: Identical in function to "random_bytes_qp".

   irand
           my $unsigned_long = $random->irand;

       Returns a random 32-bit unsigned integer.  The value will satisfy "0 <=
       x <= 2**32-1".  This functionality is only available through the OO
       interface.

   shuffle
           my $aref_shuffled = $random->shuffle($aref);

       Shuffles the contents of a reference to an array in sitiu, and returns
       the same reference.

       List::Util, which ships with Perl, includes "shuffle" function. But
       that function is flawed in two ways. First, from a cryptographic
       standpoint, it uses Perl's "rand", which is not a CSPRNG, and therefore
       is inadequate.

       Second, because Perl's rand has an internal state of just 32 bits, it
       cannot possibly generate all permutations of arrays containing 13 or
       more elements.

       This module's "shuffle" uses a CSPRNG, and also benefits from large
       seeds and a huge internal state. ISAAC can be seeded with up to 8192
       bits, yielding 2^8192 possible initial states, and 2^8288 possible
       internal states. A seed of 8192 bits will assure that for arrays of up
       to 966 elements every permutation is accessible.

CONFIGURATION
       Bytes::Random::Secure's interface tries to keep it simple.  There is
       generally nothing to configure.  This design, eliminates much of the
       potential for diminishing the quality of the random byte stream through
       misconfiguration.  The ISAAC algorithm is used as our factory, seeded
       with a strong source.

       There may be times when the default seed characteristics carry too
       heavy a burden on system resources.  The default seed for the functions
       interface is 256 bits of entropy taken from /dev/random (a blocking
       source on many systems), or via API calls on Windows.  The default seed
       size for the OO interface is also 256 bits. If /dev/random should
       become depleted at the time that this module attempts to seed the ISAAC
       generator, there could be delay while additional system entropy is
       generated.  If this is a problem, it is possible to override the
       default seeding characteristics using the OO interface instead of the
       functions interface.  However, under most circumstances, this
       capability may be safely ignored.

       Beginning with Bytes::Random::Secure version 0.20, Crypt::Random::Seed
       provides our strong seed (previously it was Crypt::Random::Source).
       This module gives us excellent "strong source" failsafe behavior, while
       keeping the non-core dependencies to a bare minimum.  Best of all, it
       performs well across a wide variety of platforms, and is compatible
       with Perl versions back through 5.6.0.

       And as mentioned earlier in this document, there may be circumstances
       where the performance of the operating system's strong random source is
       prohibitive from using the module's default seeding configuration.  Use
       the OO interface instead, and read the documentation for
       Crypt::Random::Seed to learn what options are available.

       Prior to version 0.20, a heavy dependency chain was required for
       reliably and securely seeding the ISAAC generator.  Earlier versions
       required Crypt::Random::Source, which in turn required Any::Moose.
       Thanks to Dana Jacobsen's new Crypt::Random::Seed module, this
       situation has been resolved.  So if you're looking for a secure random
       bytes solution that "just works" portably, and on Perl versions as far
       back as 5.6.0, you've come to the right place.  Users of older versions
       of this module are encouraged to update to version 0.20 or higher to
       benefit from the improved user interface and lighter dependency chain.

   OPTIONAL (RECOMMENDED) DEPENDENCY
       If performance is a consideration, you may also install
       Math::Random::ISAAC::XS. Bytes::Random::Secure's random number
       generator uses Math::Random::ISAAC.  That module implements the ISAAC
       algorithm in pure Perl.  However, if you install
       Math::Random::ISAAC::XS, you get the same algorithm implemented in
       C/XS, which will provide better performance.  If you need to produce
       your random bytes more quickly, simply installing
       Math::Random::ISAAC::XS will result in it automatically being used, and
       a pretty good performance improvement will coincide.

CAVEATS
   FORK AND THREAD SAFETY
       When programming for parallel computation, avoid the "functions"
       interface do use the Object Oriented interface, and create a unique
       "Bytes::Random::Secure" object within each process or thread.
       Bytes::Random::Secure uses a CSPRNG, and sharing the same RNG between
       threads or processes will share the same seed and the same starting
       point.  This is probably not what one would want to do. By
       instantiating the B::R::S object after forking or creating threads, a
       unique randomness stream will be created per thread or process.

   STRONG RANDOMNESS
       It's easy to generate weak pseudo-random bytes.  It's also easy to
       think you're generating strong pseudo-random bytes when really you're
       not.  And it's hard to test for pseudo-random cryptographic acceptable
       quality.  There are many high quality random number generators that are
       suitable for statistical purposes, but not necessarily up to the rigors
       of cryptographic use.

       Assuring strong (ie, secure) random bytes in a way that works across a
       wide variety of platforms is also challenging.  A primary goal for this
       module is to provide cryptographically secure pseudo-random bytes.  A
       secondary goal is to provide a simple user experience (thus reducing
       the propensity for getting it wrong).  A tertiary goal is to minimize
       the dependencies required to achieve the primary and secondary goals,
       to the extent that is practical.

   ISAAC
       The ISAAC algorithm is considered to be a cryptographically strong
       pseudo-random number generator.  There are 1.0e2466 initial states.
       The best known attack for discovering initial state would theoretically
       take a complexity of approximately 4.67e1240, which has no practical
       impact on ISAAC's security.  Cycles are guaranteed to have a minimum
       length of 2**40, with an average cycle of 2**8295.  Because there is no
       practical attack capable of discovering initial state, and because the
       average cycle is so long, it's generally unnecessary to re-seed a
       running application.  The results are uniformly distributed, unbiased,
       and unpredictable unless the seed is known.

       To confirm the quality of the CSPRNG, this module's test suite
       implements the FIPS-140-1
       <http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips1401.htm> tests for strong
       random number generators.  See the comments in "t/27-fips140-1.t" for
       details.

   DEPENDENCIES
       To keep the dependencies as light as possible this module uses some
       ideas from Math::Random::Secure.  That module is an excellent resource,
       but implements a broader range of functionality than is needed here.
       So we just borrowed from it.

       The primary source of random data in this module comes from the
       excellent Math::Random::ISAAC.  To be useful and secure, even
       Math::Random::ISAAC needs a cryptographically sound seed, which we
       derive from Crypt::Random::Seed.  There are no known weaknesses in the
       ISAAC algorithm.  And Crypt::Random::Seed does a very good job of
       preventing fall-back to weak seed sources.

       This module requires Perl 5.6 or newer.  The module also uses a number
       of core modules, some of which require newer versions than those
       contemporary with 5.6.  Unicode support in "random_string_from" is best
       with Perl 5.8.9 or newer.  See the INSTALLATION section in this
       document for details.

       If Test::Warn is installed, test coverage is 100%.  For those who don't
       want to bother installing Test::Warn, you can just take our word for
       it.  It's an optional installation dependency.

   BLOCKING ENTROPY SOURCE
       It is possible (and has been seen in testing) that the system's random
       entropy source might not have enough entropy in reserve to generate the
       seed requested by this module without blocking.  If you suspect that
       you're a victim of blocking from reads on "/dev/random", one option is
       to manipulate the random seed configuration by using the object
       oriented interface.

       This module seeds as lazily as possible so that using the module, and
       even instantiating a Bytes::Random::Secure object will not trigger
       reads from "/dev/random".  Only the first time the object is used to
       deliver random bytes will the RNG be seeded.  Long-running scripts may
       prefer to force early seeding as close to start-up time as possible,
       rather than allowing it to happen later in a program's run-time.  This
       can be achieved simply by invoking any of the functions or methods that
       return a random byte.  As soon as a random byte is requested for the
       first time, the CSPRNG will be seeded.

   UNICODE SUPPORT
       The "random_string_from" function, and "string_from" method permit the
       user to pass a "bag" (or source) string containing Unicode characters.
       For any modern Perl version, this will work just as you would hope.
       But some versions of Perl older than 5.8.9 exhibited varying degrees of
       bugginess in their handling of Unicode.  If you're depending on the
       Unicode features of this module while using Perl versions older than
       5.8.9 be sure to test thoroughly, and don't be surprised when the
       outcome isn't as expected.  ...this is to be expected.  Upgrade.

       No other functions or methods in this module get anywhere near Perl's
       Unicode features.  So as long as you're not passing Unicode source
       strings to "random_string_from", you have nothing to worry about, even
       if you're using Perl 5.6.0.

   MODULO BIAS
       Care is taken so that there is no modulo bias in the randomness
       returned either by "random_bytes" or its siblings, nor by
       "random_string_from".  As a matter if fact, this is exactly why the
       "random_string_from" function is useful.  However, the algorithm to
       eliminate modulo bias can impact the performance of the
       "random_string_from" function. Any time the length of the bag string is
       significantly less than the nearest greater or equal factor of 2**32,
       performance will degrade.  Unfortunately there is no known algorithm
       that improves upon this situation.  Fortunately, for sanely sized
       strings, it's a minor issue.  To put it in perspective, even in the
       case of passing a "bag" string of length 2**31 (which is huge), the
       expected time to return random bytes will only double.  Given that the
       entire Unicode range is just over a million possible code-points, it
       seems unlikely that the normal use case would ever have to be concerned
       with the performance of the "random_string_from" function.

INSTALLATION
       This module should install without any fuss on modern versions of Perl.
       For older Perl versions (particularly 5.6 and early 5.8.x's), it may be
       necessary to update your CPAN installer to a more modern version before
       installing this this module.

       Another alternative for those with old Perl versions who don't want to
       update their CPAN installer (You must know you're crazy, right?):
       Review "Makefile.PL" and assure that you've got the dependencies listed
       under "PREREQ_PM" and "BUILD_REQUIRES", in at least the minimum
       versions specified.  Then proceed as usual.

       This module only has two non-Core dependencies.  But it does expect
       that some of the Core dependencies are newer than those supplied with
       5.6 or early 5.8's.  If you keep your CPAN installer up-to-date, you
       shouldn't have to think about this, as it will usually just "do the
       right thing", pulling in newer dependency versions as directed by the
       module's META files.

       Test coverage for Bytes::Random::Secure is 100% (per Devel::Cover) on
       any system that has Test::Warn installed.  But to keep the module
       light-weight, Test::Warn is not dragged in by default at installation
       time.

SEE ALSO
       Math::Random::Secure and Crypt::Random provide strong CSPRINGs and even
       more configuration options, but come with hefty toolchains.

       Bytes::Random::Secure::Tiny is a stand-alone adaptation of
       Bytes::Random::Secure with no dependencies. It will, however, detect if
       Math::Random::ISAAC, Math::Random::ISAAC::XS, and Crypt::Random::Seed
       are installed on the target system, and if they are, it quietly
       upgrades to using them.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
       Dana Jacobsen ( <dana@acm.org> ) for his work that led to
       Crypt::Random::Seed, thereby significantly reducing the dependencies
       while improving the portability and backward compatibility of this
       module.  Also for providing a patch to this module that greatly
       improved the performance of "random_bytes".

       Dana Jacosen also provided extensive input, code reviews, and testing
       that helped to guide the direction this module has taken.  The code for
       the FIPS-140-1 tests was taken directly from Crypt::Random::TESHA2.
       Thanks!

       Bytes::Random for implementing a nice, simple interface that this
       module patterns itself after.
