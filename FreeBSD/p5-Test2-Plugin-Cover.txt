NAME
       Test2::EventFacet::Coverage - File coverage information.

DESCRIPTION
       This facet has a list of files covered by the test run.

FIELDS
       $string = $about->{details}
       $string = $about->details()
           Summary of files run.

       $arrayref = $about->{files}
       $arrayref = $about->files()
           Arrayref of files touched during testing. This includes modules
           that were loaded or had subroutines called. This also includes
           files opened via open().

       $hashref = $about->{submap}
       $hashref = $about->submap()
               {
                   'SomeModule.pm' => {
                       # The wildcard is used when a proper sub name cannot be determined
                       '*' => { ... },

                       'subroutine' => [
                           '*',     # The wildcard is used when no 'called by' can be determined
                           $FROM_A,
                           $FROM_B,
                           ...
                       ],
                   },
                   ...
               }

       $hashref = $about->{openmap}
       $hashref = $about->openmap()
               {
                   # The items in this list can be anything, strings, numbers,
                   # data structures, etc.
                   # A naive attempt is made to avoid duplicates in this list,
                   # so the same string or reference will not appear twice, but 2
                   # different references with identical contents may appear.
                   "some_file.ext" => [
                       '*',        # The wildcard is used when no 'called by' can be determined
                       $FROM_A,
                       $FROM_b,
                   ],
               }
