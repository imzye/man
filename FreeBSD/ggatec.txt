DESCRIPTION
     The ggatec utility is a network client for the GEOM Gate class.  It is
     responsible for the creation of ggate devices and forwarding I/O requests
     between the GEOM Gate kernel subsystem and the ggated(8) network daemon.
     Available commands:

     create       Connect to a ggated(8) daemon on the specified host and
                  create a ggate provider for the specified remote file or
                  device.

     rescue       Create a new connection after the ggatec process has died or
                  been killed.  The new connection to the ggated(8) daemon
                  handles pending and future requests.

     destroy      Destroy the given ggate provider.

     list         List ggate providers.

     Available options:

     -f                     Forcibly destroy ggate provider (cancels all
                            pending requests).

     -n                     Do not use TCP_NODELAY option on TCP sockets.

     -o ro | wo | rw        Specify permissions to use when opening the file
                            or device: read-only (ro), write-only (wo), or
                            read-write (rw).  Default is rw.

     -p port                Port to connect to on the remote host.  Default is
                            3080.

     -q queue_size          Number of pending I/O requests that can be queued
                            before they will start to be canceled.  Default is
                            1024.

     -R rcvbuf              Size of receive buffer to use.  Default is 131072
                            (128kB).

     -S sndbuf              Size of send buffer to use.  Default is 131072
                            (128kB).

     -s sectorsize          Sector size for ggate provider.  If not specified,
                            it is taken from the device, or set to 512 bytes
                            for files.

     -t timeout             Number of seconds to wait before an I/O request
                            will be canceled.  Default is 0, which means no
                            timeout.

     -u unit                Unit number to use.

     -v                     Do not fork, run in foreground and print debug
                            information on standard output.

     host                   Remote host to connect to.

     path                   Path to a regular file or device.

EXIT STATUS
     Exit status is 0 on success, or 1 if the command fails.  To get details
     about the failure, ggatec should be called with the -v option.

EXAMPLES
     Use a CD-ROM device on a remote host.

           server# cat /etc/gg.exports
           client RO /dev/cd0
           server# ggated

           client# ggatec create -o ro server /dev/cd0
           ggate0
           client# mount_cd9660 /dev/ggate0 /cdrom
