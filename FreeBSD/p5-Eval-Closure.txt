NAME
       Eval::Closure - safely and cleanly create closures via string eval

VERSION
       version 0.14

SYNOPSIS
         use Eval::Closure;

         my $code = eval_closure(
             source      => 'sub { $foo++ }',
             environment => {
                 '$foo' => \1,
             },
         );

         warn $code->(); # 1
         warn $code->(); # 2

         my $code2 = eval_closure(
             source => 'sub { $code->() }',
         ); # dies, $code isn't in scope

DESCRIPTION
       String eval is often used for dynamic code generation. For instance,
       "Moose" uses it heavily, to generate inlined versions of accessors and
       constructors, which speeds code up at runtime by a significant amount.
       String eval is not without its issues however - it's difficult to
       control the scope it's used in (which determines which variables are in
       scope inside the eval), and it's easy to miss compilation errors, since
       eval catches them and sticks them in $@ instead.

       This module attempts to solve these problems. It provides an
       "eval_closure" function, which evals a string in a clean environment,
       other than a fixed list of specified variables. Compilation errors are
       rethrown automatically.

FUNCTIONS
   eval_closure(%args)
       This function provides the main functionality of this module. It is
       exported by default. It takes a hash of parameters, with these keys
       being valid:

       source
           The string to be evaled. It should end by returning a code
           reference. It can access any variable declared in the "environment"
           parameter (and only those variables). It can be either a string, or
           an arrayref of lines (which will be joined with newlines to produce
           the string).

       environment
           The environment to provide to the eval. This should be a hashref,
           mapping variable names (including sigils) to references of the
           appropriate type. For instance, a valid value for environment would
           be "{ '@foo' => [] }" (which would allow the generated function to
           use an array named @foo). Generally, this is used to allow the
           generated function to access externally defined variables (so you
           would pass in a reference to a variable that already exists).

           In perl 5.18 and greater, the environment hash can contain
           variables with a sigil of "&". This will create a lexical sub in
           the evaluated code (see "The 'lexical_subs' feature" in feature).
           Using a "&" sigil on perl versions before lexical subs were
           available will throw an error.

       alias
           If set to true, the coderef returned closes over the variables
           referenced in the environment hashref. (This feature requires
           Devel::LexAlias.) If set to false, the coderef closes over a
           shallow copy of the variables.

           If this argument is omitted, Eval::Closure will currently assume
           false, but this assumption may change in a future version.

       description
           This lets you provide a bit more information in backtraces.
           Normally, when a function that was generated through string eval is
           called, that stack frame will show up as "(eval n)", where 'n' is a
           sequential identifier for every string eval that has happened so
           far in the program. Passing a "description" parameter lets you
           override that to something more useful (for instance, Moose
           overrides the description for accessors to something like "accessor
           foo at MyClass.pm, line 123").

       line
           This lets you override the particular line number that appears in
           backtraces, much like the "description" option. The default is 1.

       terse_error
           Normally, this function appends the source code that failed to
           compile, and prepends some explanatory text. Setting this option to
           true suppresses that behavior so you get only the compilation error
           that Perl actually reported.
