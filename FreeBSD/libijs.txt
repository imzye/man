IJS-CONFIG(1)           FreeBSD General Commands Manual          IJS-CONFIG(1)

NAME
       ijs-config - script to get information about the installed version of
       ijs

SYNOPSIS
       ijs-config [--prefix[=DIR]] [--exec-prefix[=DIR]] [--version] [--libs]
       [--cflags]

DESCRIPTION
       ijs-config is a program that is used to determine the compiler and
       linker flags that should be used to compile and link programs that use
       IJS.

OPTIONS
       This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
       options starting with two dashes (`-').  A summary of options is
       included below.

       --help Show summary of options.  This may list additional advanced
              package configuration options not detailed in this manual page.

       --version
              Show installed libijs version.

       --libs Print the linker flags that are necessary to link an IJS
              program.

       --cflags
              Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile an IJS
              program.

       --prefix=PREFIX
              If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix that
              IJS was built with when computing the output for the --cflags
              and --libs options. This option is also used for the exec prefix
              if --exec-prefix was not specified. This option must be
              specified before any --libs or --cflags options.

       --exec-prefix=PREFIX
              If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation exec prefix
              that IJS was built with when computing the output for the
              --cflags and --libs options.  This option must be specified
              before any --libs or --cflags options.
