NAME
       c_incl - determine dependencies

SYNOPSIS
       c_incl [ option...  ] filename
       c_incl -Help
       c_incl -VERSion

DESCRIPTION
       The c_incl program is used to traverse source files looking for include
       dependencies suitable for [collect]ion or #include-cooked-ing by cook.

       The filename ``-'' is understood to mean the standard input.  When you
       use this file name, caching is ignored.

       Several input languages are supported, see the options list for
       details.

OPTIONS
       The following options are understood.

       -C      The source file is a C source file.  It is assumed that it will
               have the dependencies resolved by the cpp(1) command.  The same
               include semantics as the cpp(1) command will be employed.  This
               is the default.  This is short-hand for ``--language=c''

       --Language=name
               This option may be used to specify the language of the source
               file.  Know names include ``C'', ``M4'', ``optimistic'' and
               ``roff''.

               The ``optimistic'' language will take on almost anything.  It
               accepts an include keyword in any case, including mixed, with
               leading white space, but at most one leading punctuation
               character.  It assumes that the filename follows the include
               keyword and does not contain white space, and does not start or
               end with punctuation characters (it strips off any it may
               find).  The rest of the line is ignored.  The drawback is that
               it will sometimes recognise commands and other text as
               unintended include directives, hence the name.  This is often
               used to recognise include directives in a wide variety of
               assembler input.

       -Roff   The source file is a *roff source file.  It is assumed that it
               will have the dependencies resolved by the roffpp(1) command.
               The same include semantics as the roffpp(1) command will be
               employed.  This is short-hand for ``--language=roff''

       -Verbose
               Tell what is happening.

       -Ipath
               Specify include path, a la cc(1).

       -I-
               Any directories you specify with -I options before the -I-
               option are searched only for the case of #include "file"; they
               are  not  searched for #include <file>.

               If  additional  directories are specified with -I options after
               the -I-, these directories are searched for all #include
               directives.  (Ordinarily all -I directories are used this way.)

               In addition, the -I- option inhibits the  use  of the current
               directory (where the current input file came from) as the first
               search directory for #include "file".  There is no way to
               override this effect of -I-.  With -I. you can specify
               searching the directory which was current when c_incl was
               invoked.  That is not exactly the same as what the preprocessor
               does by default, but it is often satisfactory.

               The -I- option does not inhibit the use of the standard system
               directories for header files.  Thus, -I- and -No_System are
               independent.

       -Absolute_Paths
               This option may be used to allow absolute paths in the output.
               This is usually the default.

       -No_Absolute_Paths
               This option may be used to exclude absolute paths from the
               output.

       -Absent_Local_Ignore
               For files included using a #include ''filename.h'' directive,
               ignore the file if it cannot be found.

       -Absent_Local_Mention
               For files included using a #include ''filename.h'' directive,
               print the file name even if the file cannot be found.  This is
               the default (it probably needs to be built).

       -Absent_Local_Error
               For files included using a #include ''filename.h'' directive,
               print a fatal error if the file cannot be found.

       -Absent_System_Ignore
               For files included with a #include <filename.h> directive,
               ignore the file if it cannot be found.  This is the default (it
               was probably ifdef'ed out).

       -Absent_System_Mention
               For files included with a #include <filename.h> directive,
               print the file name even if the file cannot be found.

       -Absent_System_Error
               For files included with a #include <filename.h> directive,
               print a fatal error if the file cannot be found.

       -Absent_Program_Ignore
               If the file named on the command line cannot be found, behave
               as if the file were found, but was empty.

       -Absent_Program_Error
               If the file named on the command line cannot be found, print a
               fatal error message.  This is the default.

       -Escape_Newlines
               This option may be used to request that newlines in the output
               are escaped with backslash (``\'') characters.

       -Help
               Give information on how to use c_incl.

       -EXclude filename
               This option may be used to nominate include file names which
               are not to be used.

       -VERSion
               Tell what version of c_incl is being run.

       -Interior_Files filename...
               This option may be used to tell c_incl about include files
               which don't exist yet.  This is because they are interior to
               the dependency graph, but cook(1) hasn't finished walking it
               yet.  Often used with Cook's [interior-files] function.  (Note:
               the filename list has an arbitrary number of files; it ends at
               the next option or end-of-line, so you need to be careful where
               you put the input filename.)

       -No_System
               Do not search the /usr/include directory.  By default this is
               searched last.  This option implies the -No_Absolute_Paths
               option, unless explicitly contradicted.

       -CAche
               This option may be used to turn caching on.  This is the
               default.

       -No_Cache
               This option may be used to turn caching off.

       -PREfix string
               This option may be used to print a string before any of the
               filenames are printed.  It will not be printed if no file names
               are printed.

       -Quote_FileNames
               This option may be used to have c_incl quote filenames.  This
               permits filenames to contain characters which are special to
               Cook, including spaces.

       -SUFfix string
               This option may be used to print a string after all of the
               filenames are printed.  It will not be printed if no file names
               are printed.

       -Output filename
               This option may be used to specify the output file.  Defaults
               to the standard output if not set.

       -No_Source_Relative_Includes
               This option will give a fatal error if a #include
               ''filename.h'' directive is used.  This is necessary when you
               are using Cook's search_list functionality to stitch together a
               baseline and a private work area.

       -RECursion
               This option may be used to specify that nested include files
               are to be scanned, so that their includes may also be
               discovered.  This is the default.

       -No_RECursion
               This option may be use to specify that nested include files are
               not to be scanned.  This option is recommended for use with the
               Cook cascade-for recipes.  This option implies -No_Cache,
               unless a -Cache option is specified.

       -Remove_Leading_Path path
               This option may be used to remove path prefixes from the
               included filenames.  May be used more than once.  This is
               necessary when you are using Cook's search_list functionality
               to stitch together a baseline and a private work area; usually
               as ``[prepost "-rlp=" "" [search_list]]''

       -STripdot
               This option may be used to specify that leading redundant dot
               directories are to be removed from paths before processing.
               This is the default.

       -No_STripdot
               This option may be used to specify that leading redundant dot
               directories need not be removed from paths before processing.
               (Some path flattening may still occur.)

       -Substitute_Leading_Path from to
               This option may be used to modify path prefixes from the
               included filenames.  May be used more than once.  This is
               necessary when you are performing heterogeneous builds in the
               same directory tree.  By using an ``arch'' variable to hold the
               architecture, and placing each architecture's objects in a
               separate directory tree, this option may be used as ``-slp
               [arch] "'[arch]'"'' (The outer quotes protect from Cook, the
               inner quotes protect from the shell.)  If you need more
               intricate editing, used sed(1).

       Any other options will generate an error.

       All options may be abbreviated; the abbreviation is documented as the
       upper case letters, all lower case letters and underscores (_) are
       optional.  You must use consecutive sequences of optional letters.

       All options are case insensitive, you may type them in upper case or
       lower case or a combination of both, case is not important.

       For example: the arguments "-help", "-HEL" and "-h" are all interpreted
       to mean the -Help option.  The argument "-hlp" will not be understood,
       because consecutive optional characters were not supplied.

       Options and other command line arguments may be mixed arbitrarily on
       the command line.

       The GNU long option names are understood.  Since all option names for
       c_incl are long, this means ignoring the extra leading '-'.  The
       "--option=value" convention is also understood.

CACHING
       The caching mechanism use by the c_incl program caches the results of
       searching files for include files (in a file called .c_inclrc in the
       current directory).  The cache is only refreshed when a file changes.

       The use of this cache has been shown to dramatically increase the
       performance of the c_incl program.  Typically, only a small proportions
       files in a project change between builds, resulting in a very high
       cache hit rate.

       When using caching, always use the same command line options, otherwise
       weird and wonderful things will happen.

       The .c_inclrc file is a binary file.  If you wish to rebuild the cache,
       simply delete this file with the rm(1) command.  Being a binary file,
       the .c_inclrc file is not portable across machines or operating
       systems, so you will need to delete it when you move your sources.  It
       is a binary file for performance.

       Accesses to the .c_inclrc file use file locking, so recipies using
       c_incl need not use the single-thread clause.

EXIT STATUS
       The c_incl command will exit with a status of 1 on any error.  The
       c_incl command will only exit with a status of 0 if there are no
       errors.
