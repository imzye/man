AUTOMOUNTD(8)           FreeBSD System Manager's Manual          AUTOMOUNTD(8)

NAME
     automountd – daemon handling autofs mount requests

SYNOPSIS
     automountd [-D name=value] [-i] [-m maxproc] [-o options] [-d] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
     The automountd daemon is responsible for handling autofs(5) mount
     requests, parsing maps, and mounting filesystems they specify.  On
     startup, automountd forks into background and waits for kernel requests.
     When a request is received, automountd forks a child process.  The child
     process parses the appropriate map and mounts filesystems accordingly.
     Then it signals the kernel to release blocked processes that were waiting
     for the mount.

     -D     Define a variable.

     -i     For indirect mounts, only create subdirectories if there are no
            wildcard entries.  Without -i, automountd creates all the
            subdirectories it can.  Users may not realize that the wildcard
            map entry makes it possible to access directories that have not
            yet been created.

     -m maxproc
            Limit the number of forked automountd processes, and thus the
            number of mount requests being handled in parallel.  The default
            is 30.

     -d     Debug mode: increase verbosity and do not daemonize.

     -o options
            Specify mount options.  Options specified here will be overridden
            by options entered in maps or auto_master(5).

     -v     Increase verbosity.

EXIT STATUS
     The automountd utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
