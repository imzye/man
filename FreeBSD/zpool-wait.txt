ZPOOL-WAIT(8)           FreeBSD System Manager's Manual          ZPOOL-WAIT(8)

NAME
     zpool-wait – wait for activity to stop in a ZFS storage pool

SYNOPSIS
     zpool wait [-Hp] [-T u|d] [-t activity[,activity]…] pool [interval]

DESCRIPTION
     Waits until all background activity of the given types has ceased in the
     given pool.  The activity could cease because it has completed, or
     because it has been paused or canceled by a user, or because the pool has
     been exported or destroyed.  If no activities are specified, the command
     waits until background activity of every type listed below has ceased.
     If there is no activity of the given types in progress, the command
     returns immediately.

     These are the possible values for activity, along with what each one
     waits for:
           discard     Checkpoint to be discarded
           free        freeing property to become 0
           initialize  All initializations to cease
           replace     All device replacements to cease
           remove      Device removal to cease
           resilver    Resilver to cease
           scrub       Scrub to cease
           trim        Manual trim to cease

     If an interval is provided, the amount of work remaining, in bytes, for
     each activity is printed every interval seconds.

     -H      Scripted mode.  Do not display headers, and separate fields by a
             single tab instead of arbitrary space.

     -p      Display numbers in parsable (exact) values.

     -T u|d  Display a time stamp.  Specify u for a printed representation of
             the internal representation of time.  See time(2).  Specify d for
             standard date format.  See date(1).
