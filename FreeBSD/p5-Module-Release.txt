RELEASE-TEST(1)       User Contributed Perl Documentation      RELEASE-TEST(1)


NAME
       release-test - test your dist against all available perl versions

SYNOPSIS
         release-test

DESCRIPTION
       This is a stripped-down version of Module::Release's "release" tool
       with default options aimed at testing the current distribution against
       all perl versions as givern in .releaserc. It should be somewhat
       equivalent to:

        $ release -t -a -k -D -m -p -C

       or with these options in ".releaserc":

        automated_testing 1
        skip_kwalitee 1
        skip_manifest 1
        skip_prereqs 1
        skip_changes 1
        skip_dist 1
        ignore_untracked 1
        allow_glob_in_perls 1

       All other options in .releaserc are allowed too.
