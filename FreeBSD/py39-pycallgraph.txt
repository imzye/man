PYCALLGRAPH(1)                 Python Call Graph                PYCALLGRAPH(1)



NAME
       pycallgraph - Python Call Graph

SYNOPSIS
       pycallgraph [OPTION]... OUTPUT_MODE [OUTPUT_OPTIONS] python_file.py

DESCRIPTION
       pycallgraph is a program that creates call graph visualization from
       Python scripts.

       OUTPUT_MODE can be one of graphviz, gephi and json. python_file.py is a
       python script that will be traced and afterwards, a call graph
       visualization will be generated.

GENERAL ARGUMENTS

       <OUTPUT_MODE>
              A choice of graphviz, gephi and json.

       -h, --help
              Shows a list of possible options for the command line.

       -v, --verbose
              Turns on verbose mode which will print out information of
              pycallgraph's state and processing.

       -d, --debug
              Turns on debug mode which will print out debugging information
              such as the raw Graphviz generated files.

       -ng, --no-groups
              Do not group modules in the results. By default this is turned
              on and will visually group together methods of the same module.
              The technique of grouping does rely on the type of output used.

       -s, --stdlib
              When running a trace, also include the Python standard library.

       -m, --memory
              An experimental option which includes memory tracking in the
              trace.

       -t, --threaded
              An experimental option which processes the trace in another
              thread. This may or may not be faster.

FILTERING ARGUMENTS

       -i, --include <pattern>
              Wildcard pattern of modules to include in the output. You can
              have multiple include arguments.

       -e, --exclude <pattern>
              Wildcard pattern of modules to exclude in the output. You can
              have multiple include arguments.

       --include-pycallgraph
              By default pycallgraph filters itself out of the trace. Enabling
              this will include pycallgraph in the trace.

       --max-depth
              Maximum stack depth to trace. Any calls made past this stack
              depth are not included in the trace.

GRAPHVIZ ARGUMENTS

       -l <tool>, --tool <tool>
              Modify the default Graphviz tool used by pycallgraph. It uses
              "dot", but can be changed to either neato, fdp, sfdp, twopi, or
              circo.

EXAMPLES
       Create a call graph image called pycallgraph.png on myprogram.py:

          pycallgraph graphviz -- ./myprogram.py

       Create a call graph of a standard Python installation script with
       command line parameters:

          pycallgraph graphviz --output-file=setup.png -- setup.py --dry-run install

       Run Django's manage.py script, but since there are many calls within
       Django, and will cause a massively sized generated image, we can filter
       it to only trace the core Django modules:

          pycallgraph -v --stdlib --include "django.core.*" graphviz -- ./manage.py syncdb --noinput
