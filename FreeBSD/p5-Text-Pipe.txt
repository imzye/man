NAME
       Text::Pipe - Common text filter API

SYNOPSIS
           my $pipe = Text::Pipe->new('List::First', code => { $_ < 7 });
           my $result = $pipe->filter('foo');

           # or

           use Web::Scraper;
           my $scraper = scraper {
               process '//p/a',
                   'texts[]' => [ 'TEXT', PIPE('Trim'), PIPE('Uppercase') ];
           };

DESCRIPTION
       This class is a factory for text pipes. A pipe has a filter() method
       through which input can pass. The input can be a string or a reference
       to an array of strings. Pipes can be stacked together using
       Text::Pipe::Stackable.

       The problem that this distribution tries to solve is that there are
       several distributions on CPAN which use text filtering in some way or
       other, for example the Template Toolkit or Web::Scraper. But each
       distribution is somewhat different, and they have to reimplement the
       same text filters over and over again.

       This distribution aims at offering a common text filter API. So if you
       want to use text pipes with Template Toolkit, you just need to write an
       adapter. With Web::Scraper, you can even use text pipes directly Using
       the PIPE() function, as shown in the synopsis.

       Text pipe segments live in the "Text::Pipe::" namespace. So if you
       implement a "Text::Pipe::Foo::Bar" pipe segment, you can instantiate it
       with

           my $pipe = Text::Pipe->new('Foo::Bar');

       Some pipe segments take arguments. These are described in their
       respective class documentations.

EXPORTS
       "PIPE"
               my $pipe = PIPE('Reverse', times => 2, join => ' = ');
               my $pipe = PIPE('UppercaseFirst');

           Text::Pipe exports, on request, the function PIPE() that makes it
           easier to construct pipes. It takes the same arguments as new() and
           returns the corresponding pipe.

METHODS
       "new"
               my $pipe = Text::Pipe->new('List::First', code => { $_ < 7 });

           Constructs a new pipe. The first argument is the pipe segment type
           - in the example above a "Text::Pipe::List::First" would be
           constructed. The remaining arguments are passed to that segment's
           constructor.

       "def_pipe"
               Text::Pipe->def_pipe('Foobar', sub { lc $_[1] });
               my $pipe_lowercase = Text::Pipe->new('Foobar');
               is($pipe_lowercase->filter('A TEST'), 'a test', 'lowercase pipe');

           This method provides a lightweight way to define a new pipe segment
           class. The first argument is the segment type - in the example
           above, a new segment class "Text::Pipe::Foobar" would be defined.
           The second argument is a coderef that acts as the segment's filter.
           The segment class will subclass "Text::Pipe::Base".
