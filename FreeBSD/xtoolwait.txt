XTOOLWAIT(1)            FreeBSD General Commands Manual           XTOOLWAIT(1)

NAME
       xtoolwait - start X client and wait for it to map a window

SYNOPSIS
       xtoolwait [ -display display-name ] [ -timeout nseconds ] [ -mappings
       nwindows ] [ -pid ] [ -help ] [ -version ] command

DESCRIPTION
       Xtoolwait notably decreases the startup time of an X session by
       reducing the load on the X server and the OS.  Xtoolwait starts the X
       client command in the background. It then waits until a window is
       mapped on the root window and exits.  Xtoolwait also exits if a time-
       out occurs (by default after 15 seconds), or if command exits.

OPTIONS
       -display display-name
              Monitor the X display display-name for window mapping events.
              If this option is not used, the X display defaults to the value
              of the DISPLAY environment variable.  See also section NOTES
              below.

       -timeout nseconds
              Use a time-out period of nseconds seconds. If this option is not
              used, the time-out period defaults to 15 seconds.

       -mappings nwindows
              Exit after nwindows windows have been mapped, instead of the
              default of one window. Use this option only if you are
              absolutely sure that command will map nwindows top-level
              windows, in which case it will slightly increase the
              performance.

       -pid   Print the process id (pid) of command to standard output. This
              option is useful for shell scripts that want to wait for (or
              send a signal to) command. To support shell command substitution
              (`command`), Xtoolwait redirects the standard output of command
              to standard error.

       -help  Print out the `Usage:' command syntax summary.

       -version
              Print out the version number.

USAGE
       This is the relevant part of my own .xinitrc file, showing the proper
       use of Xtoolwait:

              #
              # Startup the window manager first
              #
              olvwm & wmpid=$!
              #
              # Restore desktop settings
              # Do _not_ put xtoolwait in the background
              #
              xtoolwait -mappings 2 contool -Wp 30 30 -Ws 575 246 -WP 3 533 -Wi
              xtoolwait xeyes -geom 77x60+640+107
              xtoolwait ansi_xterm -geom 80x24+22+11
              xtoolwait clock -Wp 90 90 -Ws 150 150 -WP 733 110 -Wi
              #
              # Wait for the window manager
              #
              wait $wmpid

       Note that the window manager must be started first. Xtoolwait depends
       on it to detect window mappings. The first instance of Xtoolwait will
       wait until both the window manager and the X client have finished their
       initialization.

       Note also that the first Xtoolwait uses the -mappings option to detect
       the virtual desktop window, which is mapped by virtual window managers.
       Omit this option if you use a non-virtual window manager.

EXIT STATUS
       Xtoolwait returns 0 if it detected the mapping of a window on the root
       window, and 1 otherwise. The one exception to this rule is when command
       exits normally before mapping a window, in which case its return value
       is returned.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY
              The default display name to monitor

SEE ALSO
       xtoolplaces(1)

NOTES
       Xtoolwait does not propagate the -display option to command.  If you
       use this option, you should feed it both to Xtoolwait and to command.
       This is intentional, so don't report this as a bug.

BUGS
       Xtoolwait tries to ignore windows that are mapped by other X clients.
       The method used will fail if two or more X clients are started almost
       simultaneously.  This situation does not arise as long as all X clients
       are started by Xtoolwait during the X session startup.
