NAME
       CPAN::Audit::DB - the CPAN Security Advisory data as a Perl data
       structure, mostly for CPAN::Audit

SYNOPSIS
       This module is primarily used by CPAN::Audit.

               use CPAN::Audit::DB;

               my $db = CPAN::Audit::DB->db;

DESCRIPTION
       The "db" subroutine returns the CPAN Security Advisory (CPANSA) reports
       as a Perl data structure. However, anything can use this.

       Each release also comes with a .gpg file that has the signature for the
       file. If you cannot confirm that the module file has the right
       signature, it might have been corrupted or modified.

       This module is available outside of CPAN as a release on GitHub:
       <https://github.com/briandfoy/cpan-security-advisory/releases>.  Each
       release on GitHub includes an attestation.

       There is also a JSON file that provides the same datastructure.

   Subroutines
       There is exactly one subroutine:

       •   db

           Returns the hashref of all the CPANSA reports.

VERIFYING
       This distribution now uses GitHub Attestations
       <https://github.blog/2024-05-02-introducing-artifact-attestations-now-
       in-public-beta/>, which allow you to verify that the archive file you
       have was made from the official repo.

       You need a GitHub account and the gh tool
       <https://github.com/larsks/ghcli>.

               # download the distro file from GitHub, MetaCPAN, or a CPAN mirror
               $ gh auth login
               ...follow instructions...
               $ gh attestation verify CPANSA-DB-20241111.tar.gz --owner briandfoy

       Additionally, each release codes with GPG signature that allows you to
       verify that this. The key is the same one used when the database was
       distributed with CPAN::Audit:

               $ gpg --verify lib/CPANSA/DB.pm.gpg lib/CPANSA/DB.pm
               gpg: Signature made Mon Nov 18 11:00:10 2024 EST
               gpg:                using RSA key 75AAB42CBA0D7F37F0D6886DF83F8D5E878B6041
               gpg: Good signature from "CPAN::Audit (brian d foy) (https://github.com/briandfoy/cpan-audit) <bdfoy@cpan.org>" [ultimate]
