urlview(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             urlview(1)

NAME
       urlview - URL extractor/launcher

SYNOPSIS
       urlview filename [ filename ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       urlview is a screen oriented program for extracting URLs from text
       files and displaying a menu from which you may launch a command to view
       a specific item.

CONFIGURATION
       urlview attempts to read ~/.urlview upon startup.  If this file doesn't
       exist, it will try to read a system wide file in
       /usr/local/etc/urlview/system.urlview.  There are two configuration
       commands (order does not matter):

       REGEXP regexp
              urlview uses a regular expression to extract URLs from the
              specified text files.  \r, \t, \n and \f are all converted to
              their normal printf(3) meanings.  The default REGEXP is:

       (((http|https|ftp|gopher)|mailto):(//)?[^ <>"\t]*|(www|ftp)[0-9]?\.[-a-z0-9.]+)[^ .,;\t\n\r<">\):]?[^, <>"\t]*[^ .,;\t\n\r<">\):]


       COMMAND command
              If the specified command contains a %s, it will be subsituted
              with the URL that was requested, otherwise the URL is appended
              to the COMMAND string.  The default COMMAND is:

              /usr/local/etc/urlview/url_handler.sh

       Note: You should never put single quotes around the %s.  urlview does
       this for you, and also makes sure that single quotes eventually showing
       up inside the URL are handled properly.  (Note that this shouldn't
       happen with the default regular expression, which explicitly excludes
       single quotes.)

       WRAP  choice
              Enable or disable URL wrapping. Valid values for choice are:
              yes, no (case insensitive).  If this option is not supplied, the
              default behaviour is to disable wrapping.

       QUITONLAUNCH
              Will cause urlview to quit after you launch a URL.

FILES
       /usr/local/etc/urlview/system.urlview
              system-wide urlview configuration file

       ~/.urlview
              urlview configuration file

ENVIRONMENT
       If the environment variable BROWSER is set to a browser command, or a
       colon-delimited list of commands to try, then the specified browser is
       used. %s is replaced with the quoted url to view. If %s is not part of
       a command, the url is appended to the command.

       The BROWSER environment variable is honored only if the rc-file doesn't
       contain the COMMAND option.  The rc-file provided by the Debian package
       contains a COMMAND option.
