NAME
       Servlet - Perl Servlet API v2.3

DESCRIPTION
       The Servlet API for Perl (libservlet) is a formulation of the Java
       Servlet API in Perl. The current version of the API is 2.3.

       While the servlet concept originated with Java, its component model is
       quite natural for Perl as well. By writing servlet applications and
       deploying them in a servlet engine, application authors can spare
       themselves the effort of writing commonly needed web application
       infrastructure components for each new project. Furthermore, servlet
       applications are portable between deployment environments; they can be
       executed in any servlet engine using any process model with only a few
       configuration changes and no application code changes. Servlet
       applications are insulated from changes in vendor or platform and are
       able to portably take advantage of standard web infrastructure services
       offered by any servlet engine.
