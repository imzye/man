LASTLOGIN(8)            FreeBSD System Manager's Manual           LASTLOGIN(8)

NAME
     lastlogin – indicate last login time of users

SYNOPSIS
     lastlogin [--libxo] [-f file] [-rt] [user ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The lastlogin utility will list the last login session of each specified
     user, or for all users by default.  Each line of output contains the user
     name, the tty from which the session was conducted, any hostname, and the
     start time for the session.

     If more than one user is given, the session information for each user is
     printed in the order given on the command line.  Otherwise, information
     for all users is printed.  By default, the entries are sorted by user
     name.

     The lastlogin utility differs from last(1) in that it only prints
     information regarding the very last login session.  The last login
     database is never turned over or deleted in standard usage.

     The following options are available:

     --libxo
             Generate output via libxo(3) in a selection of different human
             and machine readable formats.  See xo_parse_args(3) for details
             on command line arguments.

     -f file
             Open last login database file instead of the system-wide
             database.

     -r      Print the entries in reverse sorted order.

     -t      Sort the elements by last login time, instead of user name.

FILES
     /var/log/utx.lastlogin  last login database
