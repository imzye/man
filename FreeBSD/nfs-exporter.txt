NFS-EXPORTER(8)         FreeBSD System Manager's Manual        NFS-EXPORTER(8)

NAME
     nfs-exporter – Export NFS statistics to Prometheus

SYNOPSIS
     nfs-exporter [-Vhs] [-b address] [-p port]

DESCRIPTION
     Prometheus is a monitoring system that gathers metrics from its targets
     by fetching them through HTTP GET requests.  Metrics are identified by a
     name and an optional set of labels.  Sample values are required to be
     numerical.

     The nfs-exporter daemon publishes statistics from the FreeBSD NFS system
     via an HTTP server, in the correct format to be scraped by Prometheus.
     Its options are as follows:

     -s      Publish statistics of the NFS server.  This is the default
             behavior.

     -b, --address address
             Bind to this local address.  By default, nfs-exporter will bind
             to the wildcard address.

     -p, --port port
             Serve metrics on this TCP port.  The default is 9898.
