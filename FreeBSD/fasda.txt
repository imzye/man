NAME
       fasda abundance - Compute abundances from SAM/BAM/CRAM data




SYNOPSIS
       fasda abundance \
           --debug \
           --show-gene-name \
           --ignore-chromosome-order \
           --feature-type extended-RE \
           --output-dir dir \
           features.gff3 alignment-file [alignment-file ...]


DESCRIPTION
       fasda abundance computes raw read counts from one or more SAM/BAM/CRAM
       files overlapping each features in a GFF3 file.  Output is an
       abundance.tsv file in the same format as those produced by kallisto.
       Estimated counts may not match those produced by kallisto as they are
       calculated differently.  However, the ratio of kallisto counts / fasda
       counts should be fairly consistent, and the fold-changes produced by
       fasda fold-change should therefore be highly similar.

       The GFF3 and SAM/BAM/CRAM inputs must be sorted in the same order.  By
       default, sort order is checked for both input streams using
       bl_chrom_name_cmp(3), and fasda abundance aborts if either is out of
       order.  If this check is disabled using --ignore-chromosome-order, and
       chromosomes in the inputs are not in the same order, fasda abundance
       may produce incorrect output.

       Abundances in the output are raw counts of properly paired reads that
       aligned to a feature of the selected type, are not flagged as
       secondary, duplicate, or supplementary alignments, and did not fail QC.
       For paired-end reads, both mates are counted separately, so the counts
       should be expected to reflect about double the number of fragments
       aligned.

       Any normalization of counts is left to downstream tools such as
       fasda-normalize(1).


OPTIONS
       --debug
              Turn on debugging output


       --show-gene-name
              Show gene name rather than feature (mRNA/transcript) name in
              output.


       --ignore-chromosome-order
              Do not abort if GFF3 or SAM/BAM/CRAM input chromosomes are not
              sorted in order determined by bl_chrom_name_cmp(3).  If this
              option is used, you must ensure that the order of the
              chromosomes is the same in the GFF3 and SAM/BAM/CRAM input.


       --feature-type extended-RE
              Indicate which feature types (column 3) in the GFF3 input each
              read should be checked for overlap with.  This is an extended
              regular expression (see regex(3)).  The default is
              "RNA$|transcript$|gene_segment$", i.e. any feature ending in
              "RNA", "transcript", or "gene_segment", such as "mRNA", "snRNA",
              "transcript", "unconfirmed_transcript", etc.  For Ensembl GFFs,
              this matches features of type "transcript" in the GTF, which is
              the default for some other tools, including kallisto and
              gffread.


       --output-dir directory
              Indicate where -abundance.tsv output files should go.  The
              default is the same directory is the SAM/BAM/CRAM input.
