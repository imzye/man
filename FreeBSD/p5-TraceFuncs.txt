NAME
       Devel::TraceFuncs - trace function calls as they happen.

SYNOPSIS
       Usage:

         require Devel::TraceFuncs;

         max_trace_depth 5;
         trace_file "foo.out";
         trace_file $file_handle;

         sub foo {
           IN(my $f, "a message");

           DEBUG "hellooo!";
         }

DESCRIPTION
       Devel::TraceFuncs provides utilities to trace the execution of a
       program.  It can print traces that look something like:

          +-> global: '0'
          |  +-> main::fo(4, 5) (in ./t.pm:32): 'now then'
          |  |  +-> main::fp(4, 5) (in ./t.pm:19)
          |  |  |  +-> main::fq() (in ./t.pm:13)
          |  |  |  |  que pee doll (in ./t.pm:8)
          |  |  |  +-< main::fq() (in ./t.pm:13)
          |  |  |  cee dee (in ./t.pm:14)
          |  |  +-< main::fp(4, 5) (in ./t.pm:19)
          |  |  ha
          |  |  hs (in ./t.pm:20)
          |  +-< main::fo(4, 5) (in ./t.pm:32): 'now then'
          |  done (in ./t.pm:34)
          +-< global: '0'

   IN
       A trace begins when a function calls IN.  A my'd variable is passed in,
       such that when that function exits, the destructor for the variable is
       called.  If this trace is to be printed, the opening line of the trace
       in printed at this time.  Any other parameters are concatenated
       together, and printed on both the opening and closing lines of the
       trace.

       I wish the syntax could be a little nicer here, but I couldn't find
       anything in perl that resembles Tcl's uplevel or upvar commands.  If I
       was one of the perl gods, I could have figured out a way to do
       something like perl5db.pl:

          sub sub {
            # create a new subroutine, with a my'd TraceFunc object
          }

   DEBUG
       Print some text to the trace file, at the correct depth in the trace.
       If the last parameter ends in "!", the arguments are printed,
       regardless of current depth.

   trace_file
       trace_file takes one argument, which is either a file name or an open
       file handle.  All trace output will go to this file.

   max_trace_depth
       To avoid lots of nesting, particularly from recursive function calls,
       you can set the maximum depth to be traced.  If this is -1 (the
       default), all levels of functions are traced.  If it is 0, no trace
       output occurs, except for DEBUG statements that end in "!".

EXAMPLE
          #!/usr/local/bin/perl -w

          use Devel::TraceFuncs;
          use strict;

          sub fq {
            IN(my $f);
            DEBUG "que", "pee", "doll!";
          }

          sub fp {
            IN(my $f);
            fq();
            DEBUG "cee", "dee";
          }

          sub fo {
            IN(my $f, "now", "then");
            &fp;
            DEBUG "ha\nhs";
          }

          if (@ARGV) {
            max_trace_depth shift;
          }

          if (@ARGV) {
            trace_file shift;
          }

          IN(my $f, 0);
          fo(4,5);

          DEBUG "done";

BUGS
       For some reason, the closing lines are reversed in this example:

          use Devel::TraceFuncs;

          max_trace_depth -1;

          sub g {
            IN(my $f);
          }

          sub f {
            IN(my $f);
            g();
          }

          f();

       What it boils down to is not letting IN be the last line of a function.
       In the debugger, the objects are destructed in the correct order, so
       this must be caused by some sort of performance optimization in the
       perl runtime.
