DateTime::TimeZone::LMT(3)                 User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       DateTime::TimeZone::LMT - A Local Mean Time time zone for DateTime

VERSION
       This documentation refers to DateTime::TimeZone::LMT version 1.01.

SYNOPSIS
         use DateTime::TimeZone::LMT;

         # Somewhere in Hawaii
         my $tz_lmt = DateTime::TimeZone::LMT->new(
           longitude => -174.2342
         );

         $now = DateTime->now( time_zone => $tz_lmt );

         my $tz_office = DateTime::TimeZone::LMT->new(
           name => 'Office',
           longitude => -174.2343
         );

         $tz_office->make_alias;

         $now = DateTime->now( time_zone => 'Office' );

         $tz_office->name;
         # Office

         # Relocate office to the neighbourhood of Volgograd
         $tz_office->longitude( 45.123 );
         # 45.123

         $tz_office->longitude;
         # 45.123

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a 'Local Mean Time' timezone for DateTime. Using
       it you can determine the Mean Time for any location on Earth. Note
       however that the Mean Time and the Apparent Time (where the sun is in
       the sky) differ from day to day. This module may account for Local
       Apparent Time in the future but then again, the Solar:: modules will
       probably be a better bet.

       If you want more information on the difference between LMT and LAT,
       search the www for 'equation of time', 'analemma' or 'ephemeris'.

       (Shameless plug-in) You can for example take a look at the example text
       sun.pdf in the repository <https://github.com/jforget/metaperlualatex>.

CONSTRUCTORS
       This module has the following constructor:

       •   new( longitude => $longitude_float, name => $name_string )

           Creates a new time zone object usable by DateTime. The zone is
           calculated to the second for the given longitude.

           Eastern longitudes are positive: 0 to +180.

           Western longitudes are negative: -180 to 0.

           An optional name can be given in order to distinguish between
           multiple instances. This is the long name accessable via DateTime.

ACCESSORS
       "DateTime::TimeZone::LMT" objects provide the following accessor
       methods:

       •   offset_for_datetime( $datetime )

           Given an object which implements the DateTime.pm API, this method
           returns the offset in seconds for the given datetime. For Olson
           time zones, this takes into account historical time zone
           information, as well as Daylight Saving Time.  The offset is
           determined by looking at the object's UTC Rata Die days and
           seconds. For LMT time zones, the historical data and DST are
           irrelevant.

       •   offset_for_local_datetime( $datetime )

           Given an object which implements the DateTime.pm API, this method
           returns the offset in seconds for the given datetime.  Unlike the
           previous method, this method uses the local time's Rata Die days
           and seconds.  This should only be done when the corresponding UTC
           time is not yet known, because local times can be ambiguous due to
           Daylight Saving Time rules.

       •   name( $new_name_string )

           Returns the name of the time zone.  This is "Local Mean Time"
           unless the contructor specifies a different name.

           If a new name is given, then the object will be changed before
           being returned.

       •   longitude( $new_longitude_float )

           Returns the longitude of the time zone.  This is the value
           specified in the constructor.

           If a new longitude is given, then the object will be changed before
           being returned.

       •   short_name_for_datetime( $datetime )

           Returns 'LMT' in all circumstances.

           It is strongly recommended that you do not rely on short names for
           anything other than display.

       •   create_alias( $alias_name );

           Creates an alias that can be called as a string by DateTime
           methods.

           This means you can "$dt = DateTime->new( time_zone => 'LMT' )" or
           "$dt = DateTime->new( time_zone => 'my alias' )" rather than the
           normal "$dt = DateTime->new( time_zone => $lmt )". This is of
           little benefit unless you're accepting a time zone name from a
           user.

           If the optional $alias_name is provided then that will be the alias
           created. Otherwise the alias is 'LMT'. Multiple aliases can be
           created from the one object.

           If the longitude is changed after an alias is created, then the
           alias WILL NOT CHANGE. The alias does not behave as an instance of
           "DateTime::TimeZone::LMT".

   Compatability methods
       The following methods always return the same value. They exist in order
       to make the LMT time zone compatible with the default
       "DateTime::TimeZone" modules.

       •   is_floating

           Returns false (0) in all circumstances.

       •   is_utc

           Returns false (0) in all circumstances.

       •   is_olson

           Returns false (0) in all circumstances.

       •   category

           Returns 'Solar' in all circumstances.

Functions
       This class also contains the following function:

       •   offset_at_longitude( $longitude )

           Given a longitude, this method returns a string offset.

DEPENDENCIES
       This module depends on basic DateTime modules: DateTime and
       DateTime::TimeZone.  It depends also on Params::Validate.
