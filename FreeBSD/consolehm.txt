CHM(8)                  FreeBSD System Manager's Manual                 CHM(8)

NAME
     chm – console display motherboard pm chipset data information

SYNOPSIS
     chm [-I | -S] [-fkh] [-d delay] [-x duty] [-r register] [-w value]

DESCRIPTION
     chm is a console application that provides a visual various readings
     provided by the hardware monitoring chipset on your motherboard.

     The following command line options are available:

     -I      Use the /dev/io interface instead of /dev/smb0. Required for
             versions of 3.x before Nov 01 1999 and some motherboards without
             SMBUS supported chipsets.

     -S      Use the SMBUS interface (default). This is only available if
             SMBUS support is compiled in.

     -f      Use Fahrenheit temperature scale.

     -k      Use Kelvin temperature scale.

     -h      Display help.

     -d n    Microseconds to wait between updates.

     -x duty
             Set fan speed to duty percent of full voltage.

     -r register
             Read a register directly from the chipset, use decimal.

     -w value
             Write value to register specified by -r, to chipset.  **KNOW WHAT
             YOU ARE DOING**

     The following kernel configuration options are required to use the
     /dev/smb0 interface:

           controller      smbus0
           controller      iicbus0
           controller      iicbb0
           controller      intpm0
           device          smb0    at smbus?

BUGS
     Currently, the intpm(4) controller is only available in FreeBSD 4.0+ and
     3.3-STABLE after 01 November 1999 although the /dev/io interface may work
     on old versions and more motherboards.
