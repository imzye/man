NAME
       Net::NSCA::Client - Send passive checks to Nagios locally and remotely.

VERSION
       This documentation refers to version 0.009002

SYNOPSIS
         use Net::NSCA::Client;

         my $nsca = Net::NSCA::Client->new(
           remote_host => 'nagios.example.net',
         );

         $nsca->send_report(
           hostname => 'web1.example.net',
           service  => 'MYSQL',
           message  => $plugin_output,
           status   => $Net::NSCA::Client::STATUS_OK,
         );

DESCRIPTION
       Send passive checks to Nagios locally and remotely.

CONSTRUCTOR
       This is fully object-oriented, and as such before any method can be
       used, the constructor needs to be called to create an object to work
       with.

   new
       This will construct a new object.

       new(%attributes)
           %attributes is a HASH where the keys are attributes (specified in
           the "ATTRIBUTES" section).

       new($attributes)
           $attributes is a HASHREF where the keys are attributes (specified
           in the "ATTRIBUTES" section).

ATTRIBUTES
         # Set an attribute
         $object->attribute_name($new_value);

         # Get an attribute
         my $value = $object->attribute_name;

   encryption_password
       This is the password to use with the encryption.

   encryption_type
       This is a string of the encryption type. See
       Net::NSCA::Client::Connection::TLS for the different encryption types.

   remote_host
       This is the remote host to connect to. This will default to
       "$DEFAULT_HOST".

   remote_port
       This is the remote port to connect to. This will default to
       "$DEFAULT_PORT".

   server_config
       This specifies the configuration of the remote NSCA server. See
       Net::NSCA::Client::ServerConfig for details about using this. Typically
       this does not need to be specified unless the NSCA server was compiled
       with customizations.

   timeout
       This is the timeout to use when connecting to the service. This will
       default to "$DEFAULT_TIMEOUT".

METHODS
   clear_encryption_password
       This will remove the encryption password that is currently set.

   hsa_encryption_password
       This will return a Boolean if there is any encryption password.

   send_report
       This will send a report on a service to the remote NSCA server. This
       method takes a HASH of arguments with the following keys:

       hostname

       This is the hostname of the service that is being reported.

       service

       This is the service description of the service that is being reported.

       message

       This is the message that the plug in gives to Nagios.

       status

       This is the status code to report to Nagios. You will want to use one
       of the "$STATUS_*" constants.

SPECIFICATION
       The NSCA protocol is currently at version 3. Simply put, the NSCA
       protocol is very simple from the perspective for the C language. The
       NSCA program has a C structure that is populated and then sent across
       the network in raw form.

   NSCA PROTOCOL 1
       Currently I cannot find any information on this (it is probably
       ancient; at least before 2002). This module does not support this
       protocol version.

   NSCA PROTOCOL 2
       This protocol is identical to "NSCA PROTOCOL 3" except that the
       "packet_version" is the integer 2 to match the protocol version. The
       difference between the two protocols is that with version 3, passive
       host checks were introduced and thus the version had to change
       otherwise the server would think that the check was for a service with
       no name.

   NSCA PROTOCOL 3
       This protocol version was first introduced in NSCA version 2.2.

       Below is the definition of the C structure taken from "common.h" in
       NSCA version 2.7.2.

         struct data_packet_struct {
           int16_t   packet_version;
           u_int32_t crc32_value;
           u_int32_t timestamp;
           int16_t   return_code;
           char      host_name[MAX_HOSTNAME_LENGTH];
           char      svc_description[MAX_DESCRIPTION_LENGTH];
           char      plugin_output[MAX_PLUGINOUTPUT_LENGTH];
         };

       When the client connects to the server, the server sends a packet with
       the following C structure taken from "common.h" in NSCA version 2.7.2.

         struct init_packet_struct {
           char      iv[TRANSMITTED_IV_SIZE];
           u_int32_t timestamp;
         };

       The packet is first completely zeroed, and thus made empty. Next, the
       packet is filled randomly with alpha-numeric characters. The C library
       actually fills it randomly with ASCII characters between 0x30 and 0x7A.
       All values are now filled into the structure (only overwriting what
       needs to be written, keeping randomness intact). The "timestamp" value
       is set to the same value that was sent by the server in the initial
       response and "crc32_value" is set to all zeros. The CRC32 is calculated
       for this packet and stored in the packet.  Next, the packet in
       encrypted with the specified method (which MUST be exactly as set in
       the server) and sent across the network.

       Encryption

       None

       When there is no encryption, then the packet is completely unchanged.

       XOR

       This is the obfucated method and so is no encryption. This is merely to
       attempt to mask the data to make it harder to see. The packet is first
       XOR'd with the IV that was sent by the server, one byte at a time. Once
       all bytes from the IV have been used, then it starts again from the
       first byte of the IV. After this, the packet is then XOR'd with the
       provided password and the same steps as followed by the IV are followed
       for the password (byte-per-byte, looping).

       All other Encryptions

       All other specified encryption methods are performed in cipher feedback
       (CFB) mode, in one bye blocks (even if the encryption method doesn't
       actually support being used in one byte block modes.

CONSTANTS
   $DEFAULT_HOST
       The is the default host to use when connecting.

   $DEFAULT_PORT

       host.

   $DEFAULT_TIMEOUT
       This is the default timeout to use when connecting to a remote host.

   $STATUS_CRITICAL
       This is the status value when a service is CRITICAL

   $STATUS_UNKNOWN
