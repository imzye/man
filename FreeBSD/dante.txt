SOCKSIFY(1)             FreeBSD General Commands Manual            SOCKSIFY(1)

NAME
       socksify - runtime socksification of selected programs

DESCRIPTION
       The shell script socksify is meant to aid in using socks with already
       compiled dynamic binaries.  This works by setting the LD_PRELOAD
       environment variable to libdsocks.  It will then attempt to wrap all
       networking-related system calls.

       When used the script can socksify a program by simply prefixing the
       given program and it's arguments with the the socksify script, like in
       the example below.

       $ socksify ftp ftp.example.org


ENVIRONMENT
       The socksify script, and the Dante socks library used by the socksify
       script, can interpret several environment variables.

       SOCKS_CONF
              Gives the name of the socks.conf file.  Default is
              /etc/socks.conf, unless it was changed when compiling the Dante
              libsocks libraries.

              Creating a socks.conf is the recommended way to use socksify,
              but socksify can also be used for most simple configurations
              without any socks.conf file, as long as the proxy server to use
              is set in one of the supported environment variables.

       SOCKS_DEBUG
              Enables debug logging.  The value given should be a number, one
              or up, indicating the level of debugging provided.

       SOCKS_LOGOUTPUT
              This value controls where the client library sends logoutput.
              It can be either syslog, stdout, stderr, a filename, or a
              combination.  The default is nowhere.

       SOCKS_USERNAME
              Use the value of SOCKS_USERNAME as the username when doing
              username authentication.

       SOCKS_PASSWORD
              Use the value of SOCKS_PASSWORD as the password when doing
              username authentication.  Not recommended as other users on the
              system might be able to see your password.

       SOCKS_SERVER, SOCKS4_SERVER, SOCKS5_SERVER,
              These variables allow the address of the server to be specified
              without using a socks.conf file.  If a socks.conf-file is
              present, it is ignored if any of these variables are set.

              The accepted format is <ipaddress>:<port>.  If the SOCKS_SERVER
              value is set, it indicates the specified server supports all
              socks versions supported by Dante.  If if either of the other
              two variables are used, they indicate the given socks server
              supports only the corresponding socks version, v4 or v5.  Note
              that if the socks server requires any form of authentication,
              you need to use SOCKS5_SERVER, as v4 does not support
              authentication.

       HTTP_CONNECT_PROXY
              This variable can be used to specify the location of a HTTP
              proxy supporting the connect request.  The format used to
              specify a HTTP proxy is http://<ipaddress>:<port>.

       UPNP_IGD
              This variable can be used to specify the location of a UPNP
              enabled IGD router.  There are three possible value for this
              variable: a full URL, the interface name the router is reachable
              via, or the value "broadcast" to search for the IGD on all
              appropriate interfaces.


       Note that if any of the above environment variables, indicating the
              proxy server to use are set, the Dante client will not parse the
              socks.conf file.


       SOCKS_AUTOADD_LANROUTES
              If this variable is set to "no", the client will not try to
              auto-add direct routes for all addresses on the LAN.  The
              default is to add them.

       SOCKS_DISABLE_THREADLOCK
              If this variable is set, the client will not perform
              threadlocking.  The default is for the client to attempt to
              figure out for itself whether the application to socksify needs
              threadlocking or not.

       SOCKS_DIRECTROUTE_FALLBACK
              If this is set to "yes", the client will fallback to attempting
              a direct connection if the proxy route fails.  The default is is
              "no".
