NAME
       PDL::Graphics::IIS - Display PDL images on IIS devices
       (saoimage/ximtool)

SYNOPSIS
        use PDL::Graphics::IIS;
        saoimage ( -geometry => '800x800' );
        iis rvals(100,100);

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides an interface to any image display 'device' which
       support the 'IIS protocol' - viz the SAOimage and Ximtool X-windows
       programs, the old SunView imtool program and presumably even the
       original IIS CRT itself if they aren't all in museums!

       These programs should be familiar to astronomers - they are used by the
       common IRAF system. The programs and their HTML documentation can be
       obtained from the following URLs:

        SAOimage: http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/software/saoimage.html
        Ximtool:  http://iraf.noao.edu/iraf/web/projects/x11iraf/x11iraf.html

       Non-astronomers may find they quite nifty for displaying 2D data.

       The Perl variable $stdimage is exported from the module and controls
       the frame buffer configuration currently in use. The default value is
       "imt1024" which specifies a "1024x1024" frame buffer. Other values
       supported by the module are:

        imt512, imt800, imt1024, imt1600, imt2048, and imt4096.

       If you have a $HOME/.imtoolrc you can use it to specify other frame
       buffer names and configurations in exactly the same way you can in
       IRAF. Here is a sample file:

        -------------------snip-------------------------
        # Format:  configno nframes width height
         1  2  512  512         # imt1|imt512
         2  2  800  800         # imt2|imt800
         3  2 1024 1024         # imt3|imt1024
         4  1 1600 1600         # imt4|imt1600
         5  1 2048 2048         # imt5|imt2048
         6  1 4096 4096         # imt6|imt4096
         7  1 8192 8192         # imt7|imt8192
         8  1 1024 4096         # imt8|imt1x4
         9  2 1144  880         # imt9|imtfs    full screen (1152x900 minus frame)
        10  2 1144  764         # imt10|imtfs35 full screen at 35mm film aspect ratio
        -------------------snip-------------------------

       (Note: some versions of SAOimage may not even work if this file is not
       present. If you get funny error messages about 'imtoolrc' try copying
       the above to $HOME/.imtoolrc or /usr/local/lib/imtoolrc)

       The Perl variable $iisframe is also exported from the module and
       controls which display frame number to use in programs such as Ximtool
       which supports multiple frames. This allows you to do useful things
       such as blink between images.

       The module communicates with the IIS device down FIFO pipes (special
       UNIX files) - unlike IRAF this module does a pretty decent job of
       intelligently guessing which file names to use for the pipes and will
       prompt for their creating if absent. Also if SAOimage or Ximtool are
       started from within Perl using the module this will guarantee correct
       file names!

FUNCTIONS
   iis
       Displays an image on a IIS device (e.g. SAOimage/Ximtool)

        iis $image, [ { MIN => $min, MAX => $max,
                        TITLE => 'pretty picture',
                        FRAME => 2 } ]
        iis $image, [$min,$max]

        (image(m,n),[\%options]) or (image(m,n),[min(),max()])

       Displays image on a IIS device. If min() or max() are omitted they are
       autoscaled. A good demonstration of PDL broadcasting can be had by
       giving iis() a data *cube* - iis() will be repeatedly called for each
       plane of the cube resulting in a poor man's movie!

       If supplied, "TITLE" is used to label the frame, if no title is
       supplied, either the "OBJECT" value stored in the image header or a
       default string is used (the title is restricted to a maximum length of
       32 characters).

       To specify which frame to draw to, either use the package variable
       $iisframe, or the "FRAME" option.

   iiscur
       Return cursor position from an IIS device (e.g. SAOimage/Ximtool)

        ($x,$y) = iiscur($ch)

       This function puts up an interactive cursor on the IIS device and
       returns the "($x,$y)" position and the character typed ($ch) by the
       user.

   iiscirc
       Draws a circle on a IIS device (e.g. SAOimage/Ximtool)

        (x(),y(),radius(),colour())

        iiscirc $x, $y, [$radius, $colour]

       Draws circles on the IIS device with specified points and colours.
       Because this module uses PDL::PP broadcasting you can supply lists of
       points via 1D arrays, etc.

       An amusing PDL idiom is:

        pdl> iiscirc iiscur

       Note the colours are the same as IRAF, viz:

        201 = cursor color (white)
        202 = black
        203 = white
        204 = red
        205 = green
        206 = blue
        207 = yellow
        208 = cyan
        209 = magenta
        210 = coral
        211 = maroon
        212 = orange
        213 = khaki
        214 = orchid
        215 = turquoise
        216 = violet
        217 = wheat

   saoimage
       Starts the SAOimage external program

        saoimage[(command line options)]

       Starts up the SAOimage external program. Default FIFO devices are
       chosen so as to be compatible with other IIS module functions. If no
       suitable FIFOs are found it will offer to create them.

       e.g.:

        pdl> saoimage
        pdl> saoimage( -geometry => '800x800' )

   ximtool
       Starts the Ximtool external program

        ximtool[(command line options)]

       Starts up the Ximtool external program. Default FIFO devices are chosen
       so as to be compatible with other IIS module functions. If no suitable
       FIFOs are found it will offer to create them.

       e.g.

        pdl> ximtool
        pdl> ximtool (-maxColors => 64)
