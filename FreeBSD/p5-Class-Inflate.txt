NAME
       Class::Inflate - Inflate HASH Object from Values in Database

SYNOPSIS
         # in package
         package Some::Package::Name;
         use Class::Inflate (
             $table_one => {
                 key => \@primary_key_fields,
                 methods => {
                     $method_one => $field_one,
                     $method_two => {
                         inflate => sub { join('-', @_) },
                         deflate => sub { split(/-/, shift(), 2) },
                         fields  => [$field_two, $field_three],
                     },
                 },
             },
             $table_two => {
                 key => \@primary_key_fields,
                 join => {
                     $table_one => {
                         $field_one => $field_1,
                     },
                 },
                 methods => {
                     $method_$three => $field_2,
                 }
             },
         );

         # in script
         use Some::Package::Name;
         my @objects = Some::Package::Name->inflate({$field_one => $value});

DESCRIPTION
       Allows for any blessed HASH object to be populated from a database, by
       describing table relationships to each method.

       When specifying a database relationship to a method, there are several
       hooks you can specify:

       inflate
           Called when converting database values into method values.
           Receives the values from the database fields specified.  The return
           values are passed to the object accessor for the method.

       postinflate
           Called after object has been inflated. The variable $::OBJECT is
           available, and contains the object being populated.

           The database handle used for inflation is available as the first
           argument to "postinflate".

       deflate
           Called when converting method values into database values.
           Receives the values from the object accessor for the method.  The
           return values are passed to the database fields specified.

       The database fields are specified as an ARRAY reference of field names,
       if any of the hooks are used.

   EXPORT
       Exports "inflate" method into caller's namespace.

       Tangram(3), Class::DBI(3), which have similar concepts, but are tied
       more closely to database structure.
