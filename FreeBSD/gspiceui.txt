NAME
       gspiceui - GUI frontend for various electronic circuit simulation
       engines


SYNOPSIS
       gspiceui [-v] [-h] [-r RCFILE] [-c] [-s SIMENG] [-a ANA] [-g [PROC]]
       [-w VIEWER] [FILE/S]


DESCRIPTION
       GNU SPICE GUI is intended to provide a GUI for various freely available
       electronic circuit simulation engines ie. GNU-Cap and NG-Spice. It uses
       gnetlist to convert schematic files to net list files and gWave or Gaw
       to display simulation results. gSchem is the preferred schematic
       capture tool.


OPTIONS
       gspiceui accepts the following options :


       -v          Print version information.


       -h          Print usage information.


       -d          Enable debug mode (generates console spew on standard
                   error).


       -r RCFILE   Specify a configuration file.


       -c          Rebuild/clean the configuration file.


       -s SIMENG   Specify the simulation engine to be used.


       -a ANA      Specify the analysis page to be displayed.


       -g [PROC]   Specify the guile procedure which is executed to create the
                   netlist.


       -w VIEWER   Specify the waveform viewer to be used.


       FILE/S      Specify a circuit description file to load or schematic
                   file/s to import. If multiple schematics files are
                   specified they are read sequentially and parsed with the
                   assumption that they are all part of the same design. Any
                   file/s must be specified at the end of the command line.


       NOTE : Option -s should come before -a if both are specified.
