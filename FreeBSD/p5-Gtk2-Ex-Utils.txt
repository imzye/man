Gtk2::Ex::Constants(3)                     User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Gtk2 Ex Constants - Extra Constants for working with Gnome2/Gtk2 in
       Perl.

SYNOPSIS
        # import only the PACKing and PADing constants
        use Gtk2::Constants qw( :pack :pad );

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides many constant values for specific aspects of
       working with Gnome2/Gtk2 Perl. The main purpose of these constants
       (aside from unified values) is to aide in the creation of human
       readable code that follows consistent naming conventions.
