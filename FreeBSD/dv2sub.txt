NAME
       dv2sub - extract info or subtitles from DV stream

SYNOPSIS
       dv2sub {-i | -s} [dv-file]

       dv2sub --subtitles-out sub-file [dv-file]

DESCRIPTION
       Utility dv2sub reads raw DV stream from file argument dv-file or
       standard input if absent. It can generate a parametr log about every
       input DV frame or create MicroDVD subtitles with the recording date &
       time.

       Memory mapped I/O is used for seekable input when available. It is
       faster than sequential access.

       dv2sub uses GPL codec for DV video LibDV, see
       http://libdv.sourceforge.net/.

OPTIONS
       -i, --info
          Generate a simple information about every input DV frame. Reported
          are: frame number (counting from 0), video norm PAL/NTSC, aspect
          ratio normal (4:3) or wide (16:9), interlaced or progressive
          material, number of audio channels, audio sampling frequency, number
          of audio samples, timestamp, recording date & time.

       --ssyb-dump
          Dump SSYB packets in hexadecimal form. (implies -i)

       --vaux-dump
          Dump VAUX packets in hexadecimal form. (implies -i)

       --info-out info-file
          Generate info (like with option -i, --info) and write output into
          file info-file.

       -s, --subtitles
          Generate MicroDVD subtitles with the recording date & time.

       --subtitles-out sub-file
          Generate subtitles (like -s, --subtitles) and write output into file
          sub-file.

       -f, --time-format fmt
          Use the format specification fmt by strftime() to output a subtitle
          line. The default format value is `%F|%T'.

       -b, --boundary time
          Don't output subtitles with time above a boundary. The option
          argument syntax is YYYY[-mm[-dd [HH:MM[:SS]]]]. Default values for
          missing parts are the minimal ones. E.g.  2007 sets boundary to
          2007-01-01 00:00:00.

          Suppose you recorded a video. You grabbed video into a computer and
          edit it with non-linear editor like kino latter. Video transitions
          between scenes have date and time set to time of editing. You can
          use this option to filter out date and time subtitles of edited
          parts.

       -n, --max-frames num
          Don't process more than num frames.

       -d, --date1
          Output one line with the recording date & time from the 3rd frame.

       --no-mmap
          Don't use mmap().

       -p, --pass-through
          Pass an input DV stream to stdout (implies --no-mmap). This option
          is usable mainly if you need to extract subtitles and encode the DV
          in one pass. You can avoid reading huge DV file twice by passing
          stdout through pipe to an encoder (ffmpeg, mpeg2enc,...).

       -h, --help
          Output a brief help message.

       -V, --version
          Output a version number.
