NAME
       Crypt::Simple - encrypt stuff simply

SYNOPSIS
         use Crypt::Simple;

         my $data = encrypt(@stuff);

         my @same_stuff = decrypt($data);

DESCRIPTION
       Maybe you have a web application and you need to store some session
       data at the client side (in a cookie or hidden form fields) but you
       don't want the user to be able to mess with the data.  Maybe you want
       to save secret information to a text file.  Maybe you have better ideas
       of what to do with encrypted stuff!

       This little module will convert all your data into nice base64 text
       that you can save in a text file, send in an email, store in a cookie
       or web page, or bounce around the Net.  The data you encrypt can be as
       simple or as complicated as you like.

KEY
       If you don't pass any options when using "Crypt::Simple" we will
       generate a key for you based on the name of your module that uses this
       one.  In many cases this works fine, but you may want more control over
       the key.  Here's how:

       use Crypt::Simple passphrase => 'pass phrase';
           The MD5 hash of the text string "pass phrase" is used as the key.

       use Crypt::Simple prompt => 'Please type the magic words';
           The user is prompted to enter a passphrase, and the MD5 hash of the
           entered text is used as the key.

       use Crypt::Simple passfile => '/home/marty/secret';
           The contents of the file /home/marty/secret are used as the pass
           phrase: the MD5 hash of the file is used as the key.

       use Crypt::Simple file => '/home/marty/noise';
           The contents of the file /home/marty/noise are directly used as the
           key.

INTERNALS
       "Crypt::Simple" is really just a wrapper round a few other useful Perl
       modules: you may want to read the documentation for these modules too.

       We use "FreezeThaw" to squish all your data into a concise textual
       representation.  We use "Compress::Zlib" to compress this string, and
       then use "Crypt::Blowfish" in a home-brew CBC mode to perform the
       encryption.  Somewhere in this process we also add a MD5 digest (using
       "Digest::MD5").  Then we throw the whole thing through "MIME::Base64"
       to produce a nice bit of text for you to play with.

       Decryption, obviously, is the reverse of this process.

WARNING
       Governments throughout the world do not like encryption because it
       makes it difficult for them to look at all your stuff.  Each country
       has a different policy designed to stop you using encryption: some
       governments are honest enough to make it illegal; some think it is a
       dangerous weapon; some insist that you are free to encrypt, but only
       evil people would want to; some make confusing and contradictory laws
       because they try to do all of the above.

       Although this modules itself does not include any encryption code, it
       does use another module that contains encryption code, and this
       documentation mentions encryption.  Downloading, using, or reading this
       modules could be illegal where you live.
