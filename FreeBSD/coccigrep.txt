NAME
       coccigrep - semantic grep for the C programming language


SYNOPSIS
       coccigrep [OPTIONS] -t TYPE  [FILE...]


DESCRIPTION
       coccigrep is a semantic grep for the C programming language.  It is
       based on coccinelle and can be used to find where a given structure is
       used in C source files. coccigrep depends on the spatch program which
       comes with coccinelle.


OPTIONS
   Display options
       -A NUM, --after-context=NUM
              Print NUM lines of trailing context after matching line.

       -B NUM, --before-context=NUM
              Print NUM lines of leading context before matching line.

       -c, --color
              Colorize output (needs pygments).

       -C NUM, --context=NUM
              Print NUM lines of output context.

       -f FORMAT, --output-format=FORMAT
              Colorize format for output.  FORMAT is term or html.


   Search options
       -a ATTRIBUTE, --attribut=ATTRIBUTE
              Match operations that involve the field ATTRIBUTE of the
              structure given with option -t.

       --cpp  Activate coccinelle C++ support.

       -o OPERATION, --operation=OPERATION
              Specify the kind of operation to look for.  The available values
              for OPERATION are:

              deref
                     Any access to an ATTRIBUTE.
              func
                     Any function call for which one of the parameters is of
                     type TYPE (as defined with -t). In this operation, the
                     option -a sets the name of the function to match and does
                     not refer to an attribute.
              set
                     Any operation wich changes the value of an ATTRIBUTE.
              test
                     Any boolean test where an ATTRIBUTE appears.
              used
                     Any statement where the type TYPE (as defined with -t)
                     appears.  This OPERATION does not need to look for an
                     ATTRIBUTE thus it ignores option -a.

              The default operation is used if -a is not given, or deref if it
              is.  Depending on your environment, more OPERATIONs may be
              available.  See option -L for information about OPERATION
              listing.

       -t TYPE, --type=TYPE
              C type to look for.


   Editor options
       -E, --emacs
              Emacs output.

       -V, --vim
              Vim output.


   Program information
       -h, --help
              Print usage message and exit.

       -L, --list-operations
              List available OPERATIONs. Use together with -v to get detailed
              information about listed OPERATIONs.

       -v, --verbose
              Verbose output (including coccinelle errors).

       --version
              Print the version number of coccigrep.


   Other options
       -p NCPUS, --process=NCPUS
              Number of cpus to use.

       -s SP, --sp=SP
              Semantic patch to use.

       -l FILE, --file-list=FILE
              File containing a list of input files.


BUGS
       The operation option could lead to some missed match because the
       semantic patches used internally may need some improvements.  Use
       options -L together with -v to get detailed information about available
       operations.

       All ideas are welcome.


EXAMPLES
       1. Find where in a set of files the structure Packet is used:
            $ coccigrep -t Packet *c

       2. Finds where in a set of files the datalink attribute is used in the structure Packet:
            $ coccigrep -t Packet -a datalink *c

       3. Finds where the datalink attribute of Packet is set:
            $ coccigrep -t Packet -a datalink -o set source*c


FILES
       ~/.coccigrep   Configuration file for coccigrep.
