NAME
       search_overview -- Render a SearchIO parser report into a simple
       overview graphic

SYNOPSIS
       search_overview -i filename [-f format] [-o outputfilename] [--labels]

DESCRIPTION
       This script will take any Bio::SearchIO parseable report and turn it
       into a simple overview graphic of the report.  For our purposes we are
       assuming BLAST and the BLAST scores when assigning colors.  Output is a
       PNG format file.

       This is not intended to be an overly customized script, rather it
       should probably just be either a quick and dirty look at a report or a
       starting point for more complicated implementations.

       The color is determined by the hit score which is currently pegged to
       the NCBI scheme which looks like this

        RED     E<gt>= 200
        PURPLE  80-200
        GREEN   50-80
        BLUE    40-50
        BLACK   E<lt>40

       Options:
        -i/--input        The input filename, otherwise input is assumed from
       STDIN
        -o/--output       The output filename, this is optional, if you do not
                          provide the output filename the script will create a
       file
                          using the name of the query sequence and will
       process
                          all the sequences in the file.  If an output
       filename
                          IS provided the script will only display an image
       for the
                          first one.
        -f/--format       The SearchIO format parser to use, if not provided
                          SearchIO will guess based on the file extension.
        -l/--labels       Display the hit sequence name as a label in the
       overview.
                          For lots of sequences this will make the image very
       long
                          so by default it is turned off.
