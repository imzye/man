DESCRIPTION
       The editline library provides generic line editing, history and
       tokenization functions, similar to those found in sh(1).

       These functions are available in the libedit library (which needs the
       libtermcap library).  Programs should be linked with -ledit ltermcap .

       The editline library respects the LC_CTYPE locale set by the
       application program and never uses setlocale(3) to change the locale.

LINE EDITING FUNCTIONS
       The line editing functions use a common data structure, EditLine, which
       is created by el_init() or el_init_fd() and freed by el_end().

       The wide-character functions behave the same way as their narrow
       counterparts.

       The following functions are available:

       el_init()
              Initialize the line editor, and return a data structure to be
              used by all other line editing functions, or NULL on failure.
              prog  is the name of the invoking program, used when reading the
              editrc(5) file to determine which settings to use.  fin, fout
              and ferr  are the input, output, and error streams
              (respectively) to use.  In this documentation, references to
              ``the tty'' are actually to this input/output stream
              combination.

       el_init_fd()
              Like el_init() but allows specifying file descriptors for the
              stdio(3) corresponding streams, in case those were created with
              funopen(3).

       el_end()
              Clean up and finish with e, assumed to have been created with
              el_init() or el_init_fd().

       el_reset()
              Reset the tty and the parser.  This should be called after an
              error which may have upset the tty's state.

       el_gets()
              Read a line from the tty.  count  is modified to contain the
              number of characters read.  Returns the line read if successful,
              or NULL if no characters were read or if an error occurred.  If
              an error occurred, count  is set to -1 and errno contains the
              error code that caused it.  The return value may not remain
              valid across calls to el_gets() and must be copied if the data
              is to be retained.

       el_wgetc()
              Read a wide character from the tty, respecting the current
              locale, or from the input queue described in editline(7) if that
              is not empty, and store it in wc.  If an invalid or incomplete
              character is found, it is discarded, errno is set to Er EILSEQ ,
              and the next character is read and stored in wc.  Returns 1 if a
              valid character was read, 0 on end of file, or -1 on read(2)
              failure.  In the latter case, errno is set to indicate the
              error.

       el_getc()
              Read a wide character as described for el_wgetc() and return 0
              on end of file or -1 on failure.  If the wide character can be
              represented as a single-byte character, convert it with
              wctob(3), store the result in ch, and return 1; otherwise, set
              errno to Er ERANGE and return -1.  In the C or POSIX locale,
              this simply reads a byte, but for any other locale, including
              UTF-8, this is rarely useful.

       el_wpush()
              Push the wide character string wcs  back onto the input queue
              described in editline(7).  If the queue overflows, for example
              due to a recursive macro, or if an error occurs, for example
              because wcs  is NULL or memory allocation fails, the function
              beeps at the user, but does not report the problem to the
              caller.

       el_push()
              Use the current locale to convert the multibyte string mbs  to a
              wide character string, and pass the result to el_wpush().

       el_parse()
              Parses the argv  array (which is argc  elements in size) to
              execute builtin editline commands.  If the command is prefixed
              with ``prog :'' then el_parse() will only execute the command if
              ``prog'' matches the prog  argument supplied to el_init().  The
              return value is -1 if the command is unknown, 0 if there was no
              error or ``prog'' didn't match, or 1 if the command returned an
              error.  Refer to editrc(5) for more information.

       el_set()
              Set editline parameters.  op  determines which parameter to set,
              and each operation has its own parameter list.  Returns 0 on
              success, -1 on failure.

              The following values for op  are supported, along with the
              required argument list:

              EL_PROMPT , char *(*f)(EditLine *)
                     Define prompt printing function as f, which is to return
                     a string that contains the prompt.

              EL_PROMPT_ESC , char *(*f)(EditLine *), Fa char c
                     Same as EL_PROMPT , but the c  argument indicates the
                     start/stop literal prompt character.

                     If a start/stop literal character is found in the prompt,
                     the character itself is not printed, but characters after
                     it are printed directly to the terminal without affecting
                     the state of the current line.  A subsequent second
                     start/stop literal character ends this behavior.  This is
                     typically used to embed literal escape sequences that
                     change the color/style of the terminal in the prompt.
                     Note that the literal escape character cannot be the last
                     character in the prompt, as the escape sequence is
                     attached to the next character in the prompt.  0 unsets
                     it.

              EL_REFRESH
                     Re-display the current line on the next terminal line.

              EL_RPROMPT , char *(*f)(EditLine *)
                     Define right side prompt printing function as f, which is
                     to return a string that contains the prompt.

              EL_RPROMPT_ESC , char *(*f)(EditLine *), Fa char c
                     Define the right prompt printing function but with a
                     literal escape character.

              EL_TERMINAL , const char *type
                     Define terminal type of the tty to be type, or to TERM if
                     type  is NULL .

              EL_EDITOR , const char *mode
                     Set editing mode to mode, which must be one of ``emacs''
                     or ``vi''.

              EL_SIGNAL , int flag
                     If flag  is non-zero, editline will install its own
                     signal handler for the following signals when reading
                     command input: SIGCONT , SIGHUP , SIGINT , SIGQUIT ,
                     SIGSTOP , SIGTERM , SIGTSTP , and SIGWINCH .  Otherwise,
                     the current signal handlers will be used.

              EL_BIND , const char *, Fa ..., Dv NULL
                     Perform the bind builtin command.  Refer to editrc(5) for
                     more information.

              EL_ECHOTC , const char *, Fa ..., Dv NULL
                     Perform the echotc builtin command.  Refer to editrc(5)
                     for more information.

              EL_SETTC , const char *, Fa ..., Dv NULL
                     Perform the settc builtin command.  Refer to editrc(5)
                     for more information.

              EL_SETTY , const char *, Fa ..., Dv NULL
                     Perform the setty builtin command.  Refer to editrc(5)
                     for more information.

              EL_TELLTC , const char *, Fa ..., Dv NULL
                     Perform the telltc builtin command.  Refer to editrc(5)
                     for more information.

              EL_ADDFN , const char *name, Fa const char *help, _
                     Fa "unsigned char (*func)(EditLine *e, int ch)" Add a
                     user defined function, func(), referred to as name  which
                     is invoked when a key which is bound to name  is entered.
                     help  is a description of name.  At invocation time, ch
                     is the key which caused the invocation.  The return value
                     of func() should be one of:

                     CC_NORM
                            Add a normal character.

                     CC_NEWLINE
                            End of line was entered.

                     CC_EOF EOF was entered.

                     CC_ARGHACK
                            Expecting further command input as arguments, do
                            nothing visually.

                     CC_REFRESH
                            Refresh display.

                     CC_REFRESH_BEEP
                            Refresh display, and beep.

                     CC_CURSOR
                            Cursor moved, so update and perform CC_REFRESH .

                     CC_REDISPLAY
                            Redisplay entire input line.  This is useful if a
                            key binding outputs extra information.

                     CC_ERROR
                            An error occurred.  Beep, and flush tty.

                     CC_FATAL
                            Fatal error, reset tty to known state.

              EL_HIST , History *(*func)(History *, int op, ...), _
                     Fa "const char *ptr" Defines which history function to
                     use, which is usually history().  ptr  should be the
                     value returned by history_init().

              EL_EDITMODE , int flag
                     If flag  is non-zero, editing is enabled (the default).
                     Note that this is only an indication, and does not affect
                     the operation of . At this time, it is the caller's
                     responsibility to check this (using el_get() ) to
                     determine if editing should be enabled or not.

              EL_UNBUFFERED , int flag
                     If flag  is zero, unbuffered mode is disabled (the
                     default).  In unbuffered mode, el_gets() will return
                     immediately after processing a single character.

              EL_SAFEREAD , int flag
                     If the flag  argument is non-zero, then editline attempts
                     to recover from read errors, ignoring the first
                     interrupted error, and trying to reset the input file
                     descriptor to reset non-blocking I/O.  This is disabled
                     by default, and desirable only when editline is used in
                     shell-like applications.

              EL_GETCFN , el_rfunc_t f
                     Whenever reading a character, use the function -ragged
                     -offset indent -compact

              int
              Fo f EditLine *e wchar_t *wc Fc which stores the character in wc
              and returns 1 on success, 0 on end of file, or -1 on I/O or
              encoding errors.  Functions internally using it include
              el_wgets(), el_wgetc(), el_gets(), and el_getc().  Initially, a
              builtin function is installed, and replacing it is discouraged
              because writing such a function is very error prone.  The
              builtin function can be restored at any time by passing the
              special value EL_BUILTIN_GETCFN instead of a function pointer.

              EL_CLIENTDATA , void *data
                     Register data  to be associated with this EditLine
                     structure.  It can be retrieved with the corresponding
                     el_get(); call.

              EL_SETFP , int fd, Fa FILE *fp
                     Set the current editline file pointer for ``input'' fd  =
                     0 , ``output'' fd  = 1 , or ``error'' fd  = 2 from fp.

       el_get()
              Get editline parameters.  op  determines which parameter to
              retrieve into result.  Returns 0 if successful, -1 otherwise.

              The following values for op  are supported, along with actual
              type of result :

              EL_PROMPT , char *(*f)(EditLine *), Fa char *c
                     Set f  to a pointer to the function that displays the
                     prompt.  If c  is not NULL , set it to the start/stop
                     literal prompt character.

              EL_RPROMPT , char *(*f)(EditLine *), Fa char *c
                     Set f  to a pointer to the function that displays the
                     prompt.  If c  is not NULL , set it to the start/stop
                     literal prompt character.

              EL_EDITOR , const char **n
                     Set the name of the editor in n, which will be one of
                     ``emacs'' or ``vi''.

              EL_GETTC , const char *name, Fa void *value
                     If name  is a valid termcap(5) capability set value  to
                     the current value of that capability.

              EL_SIGNAL , int *s
                     Set s  to non-zero if editline has installed private
                     signal handlers (see el_get() above).

              EL_EDITMODE , int *c
                     Set c  to non-zero if editing is enabled.

              EL_GETCFN , el_rfunc_t *f
                     Set f  to a pointer to the function that reads
                     characters, or to EL_BUILTIN_GETCFN if the builtin
                     function is in use.

              EL_CLIENTDATA , void **data
                     Set data  to the previously registered client data set by
                     an el_set() call.

              EL_UNBUFFERED , int *c
                     Set c  to non-zero if unbuffered mode is enabled.

              EL_SAFEREAD , int *c
                     Set c  to non-zero if safe read is set.

              EL_GETFP , int fd", Fa FILE **fp
                     Set fp  to the current editline file pointer for
                     ``input'' fd  = 0 , ``output'' fd  = 1 , or ``error'' fd
                     = 2 .

       el_source()
              Initialize editline by reading the contents of file.  el_parse()
              is called for each line in file.  If file  is NULL , try $EDITRC
              and if that is not set $HOME/.editrc.  Refer to editrc(5) for
              details on the format of file.  el_source() returns 0 on success
              and -1 on error.

       el_resize()
              Must be called if the terminal size changes.  If EL_SIGNAL has
              been set with el_set(), then this is done automatically.
              Otherwise, it's the responsibility of the application to call
              el_resize() on the appropriate occasions.

       el_cursor()
              Move the cursor to the right (if positive) or to the left (if
              negative) count  characters.  Returns the resulting offset of
              the cursor from the beginning of the line.

       el_line()
              Return the editing information for the current line in a
              LineInfo  structure, which is defined as follows:

              typedef struct lineinfo {
                  const char *buffer;    /* address of buffer */
                  const char *cursor;    /* address of cursor */
                  const char *lastchar;  /* address of last character */
              } LineInfo;

              buffer  is not NUL terminated.  This function may be called
              after el_gets() to obtain the LineInfo  structure pertaining to
              line returned by that function, and from within user defined
              functions added with EL_ADDFN .

       el_insertstr()
              Insert str  into the line at the cursor.  Returns -1 if str  is
              empty or won't fit, and 0 otherwise.

       el_deletestr()
              Delete count  characters before the cursor.

HISTORY LIST FUNCTIONS
       The history functions use a common data structure, History, which is
       created by history_init() and freed by history_end().

       The following functions are available:

       history_init()
              Initialize the history list, and return a data structure to be
              used by all other history list functions, or NULL on failure.

       history_end()
              Clean up and finish with h, assumed to have been created with
              history_init().

       history()
              Perform operation op  on the history list, with optional
              arguments as needed by the operation.  ev  is changed
              accordingly to operation.  The following values for op  are
              supported, along with the required argument list:

              H_SETSIZE , int size
                     Set size of history to size  elements.

              H_GETSIZE
                     Get number of events currently in history.

              H_END  Cleans up and finishes with h, assumed to be created with
                     history_init().

              H_CLEAR
                     Clear the history.

              H_FUNC , void *ptr, Fa history_gfun_t first, _
                     Fa "history_gfun_t next" , Fa "history_gfun_t last" , Fa
                     "history_gfun_t prev" , Fa "history_gfun_t curr" , Fa
                     "history_sfun_t set" , Fa "history_vfun_t clear" , Fa
                     "history_efun_t enter" , Fa "history_efun_t add" Define
                     functions to perform various history operations.  ptr  is
                     the argument given to a function when it's invoked.

              H_FIRST
                     Return the first element in the history.

              H_LAST Return the last element in the history.

              H_PREV Return the previous element in the history.  It is newer
                     than the current one.

              H_NEXT Return the next element in the history.  It is older than
                     the current one.

              H_CURR Return the current element in the history.

              H_SET , int position
                     Set the cursor to point to the requested element.

              H_ADD , const char *str
                     Append str  to the current element of the history, or
                     perform the H_ENTER operation with argument str  if there
                     is no current element.

              H_APPEND , const char *str
                     Append str  to the last new element of the history.

              H_ENTER , const char *str
                     Add str  as a new element to the history and, if
                     necessary, removing the oldest entry to keep the list to
                     the created size.  If H_SETUNIQUE has been called with a
                     non-zero argument, the element will not be entered into
                     the history if its contents match the ones of the current
                     history element.  If the element is entered history()
                     returns 1; if it is ignored as a duplicate returns 0.
                     Finally history() returns -1 if an error occurred.

              H_PREV_STR , const char *str
                     Return the closest previous event that starts with str.

              H_NEXT_STR , const char *str
                     Return the closest next event that starts with str.

              H_PREV_EVENT , int e
                     Return the previous event numbered e.

              H_NEXT_EVENT , int e
                     Return the next event numbered e.

              H_LOAD , const char *file
                     Load the history list stored in file.

              H_SAVE , const char *file
                     Save the history list to file.

              H_SAVE_FP , FILE *fp
                     Save the history list to the opened

              FILE
              pointer fp.

              H_NSAVE_FP , size_t n, Fa FILE *fp
                     Save the last

              n
              history entries to the opened

              FILE
              pointer fp.

              H_SETUNIQUE , int unique
                     Set flag that adjacent identical event strings should not
                     be entered into the history.

              H_GETUNIQUE
                     Retrieve the current setting if adjacent identical
                     elements should be entered into the history.

              H_DEL , int e
                     Delete the event numbered e.  This function is only
                     provided for readline compatibility.  The caller is
                     responsible for free'ing the string in the returned
                     HistEvent.

       history(); returns >= 0 if the operation op  succeeds.  Otherwise, -1
       is returned and ev  is updated to contain more details about the error.

TOKENIZATION FUNCTIONS
       The tokenization functions use a common data structure, Tokenizer,
       which is created by tok_init() and freed by tok_end().

       The following functions are available:

       tok_init()
              Initialize the tokenizer, and return a data structure to be used
              by all other tokenizer functions.  IFS  contains the Input Field
              Separators, which defaults to <space ,> <tab ,> and <newline> if
              NULL .

       tok_end()
              Clean up and finish with t, assumed to have been created with
              tok_init().

       tok_reset()
              Reset the tokenizer state.  Use after a line has been
              successfully tokenized by tok_line() or tok_str() and before a
              new line is to be tokenized.

       tok_line()
              Tokenize li, If successful, modify: argv  to contain the words,
              argc  to contain the number of words, cursorc  (if not NULL ) to
              contain the index of the word containing the cursor, and cursoro
              (if not NULL ) to contain the offset within argv[cursorc]  of
              the cursor.

              Returns 0 if successful, -1 for an internal error, 1 for an
              unmatched single quote, 2 for an unmatched double quote, and 3
              for a backslash quoted <newline .> A positive exit code
              indicates that another line should be read and tokenization
              attempted again.

       tok_str()
              A simpler form of tok_line(; ) str  is a NUL terminated string
              to tokenize.

HISTORY
       The editline library first appeared in Bx 4.4 .  CC_REDISPLAY appeared
       in Nx 1.3 .  CC_REFRESH_BEEP , EL_EDITMODE and the readline emulation
       appeared in Nx 1.4 .  EL_RPROMPT appeared in Nx 1.5 .

AUTHORS
       -nosplit The editline library was written by

       Christos Zoulas .

       Luke Mewburn wrote this manual and implemented CC_REDISPLAY ,
       CC_REFRESH_BEEP , EL_EDITMODE , and EL_RPROMPT .

       Jaromir Dolecek implemented the readline emulation.

       Johny Mattsson implemented wide-character support.

BUGS
       At this time, it is the responsibility of the caller to check the
       result of the EL_EDITMODE operation of el_get() (after an el_source()
       or el_parse() ) to determine if editline should be used for further
       input.  I.e., EL_EDITMODE is purely an indication of the result of the
       most recent editrc(5) edit command.
