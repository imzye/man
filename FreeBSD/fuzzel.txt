fuzzel(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              fuzzel(1)

NAME
       fuzzel - Wayland app launcher and picker

SYNOPSIS
       fuzzel [OPTIONS]...

DESCRIPTION
       As a launcher, fuzzel lists all available XDG applications in a
       searchable window.

       With the --dmenu flag, fuzzel works like a general-purpose picker like
       dmenu, rofi or fzf. Options to choose from are provided on the STDIN
       and the selected option is printed to STDOUT.

       The search box supports Emacs-like key bindings.

       Many things can be configured with fuzzel.ini(5) or command line
       options:

       --config=PATH
           Path to configuration file, see fuzzel.ini(5) for details.

       --check-config
           Verify configuration and then exit with 0 if ok, otherwise exit
           with 1.

       --cache=PATH
           Use a custom cache location. Fuzzel uses this file to cache the
           most commonly launched applications (to be able to sort them at the
           top).

           You can also use this option to enable caching of dmenu entries. It
           is recommended that you use a separate cache file for each "type"
           of dmenu invocation; i.e. one for the browser history, another for
           emojis etc.

           Set to /dev/null to disable caching.

           Default: XDG_CACHE_HOME/fuzzel

       -o,--output=OUTPUT
           Specifies the monitor to display the window on. Autocompletion is
           available for zsh and fish, or you can list the available outputs
           with wlr-randr or with Sway using swaymsg -t get_outputs.

           Example: DP-1

           Default: Let the compositor choose output.

       -f,--font=FONT[,FALLBACK1,FALLBACK2,...]
           Comma separated list of primary font, and fallback fonts, in
           FontConfig format. See FONT FORMAT. Default: monospace.

       --use-bold
           Allow fuzzel to use bold fonts.

       -D,--dpi-aware=no|yes|auto
           When set to yes, fonts are sized using the monitor's DPI, making a
           font of a given point size have the same physical size, regardless
           of monitor.

           In this mode, the monitor's scaling factor is ignored; doubling the
           scaling factor will not double the font size.

           When set to no, the monitor's DPI is ignored. The font is instead
           sized using the monitor's scaling factor; doubling the scaling
           factor does double the font size.

           Finally, if set to auto, fonts will be sized using the monitor's
           DPI if all monitors have a scaling factor of 1. If at least one
           monitor as a scaling factor larger than 1 (regardless of whether
           the fuzzel window is mapped on that monitor or not), fonts will be
           scaled using the scaling factor.

           Note that this option typically does not work with bitmap fonts,
           which only contains a pre-defined set of sizes, and cannot be
           dynamically scaled. Whichever size (of the available ones) that
           best matches the DPI or scaling factor, will be used.

           Also note that if the font size has been specified in pixels
           (:pixelsize=N, instead of :size=N), DPI scaling (dpi-aware=yes)
           will have no effect (the specified pixel size will be used as is).
           But, if the monitor's scaling factor is used to size the font (dpi-
           aware=no), the font's pixel size will be multiplied with the
           scaling factor.

           Default: auto

       -p,--prompt=PROMPT
           Prompt to use. Default: > .

       --prompt-only=PROMPT
           Same as --prompt, but in --dmenu mode it also:
           •   does not read anything from STDIN
           •   sets --lines to 0

           In non-dmenu mode it behaves exactly like --prompt.

       --placeholder=TEXT
           Text to display as placeholder in the input box. Default: empty.

       --search=TEXT
           Initial search/filter string. This option pre-fills the input box
           with the specified string, letting you pre-filter the result.

       -i
           Ignored; for compatibility with other, similar utilities (where -i
           means "case insensitive search").

       --icon-theme=NAME
           Icon theme to use. Note that this option is case sensitive; the
           name must match the theme's folder name.

           Example: Adwaita.

           Default: hicolor.

       -I,--no-icons
           Do not render any icons.

       --hide-before-typing
           Hide application list until something is typed.

       -F,--fields=FIELDS
           Comma separated list of XDG Desktop entry fields to match against:

           •   filename: the .desktop file's filename
           •   name: the application's name (title)
           •   generic: the application's generic name
           •   exec: the applications's executable, as specified in the
               desktop file. Note: may include command line options as well.
           •   keywords: the application's keywords
           •   categories: the application's categories
           •   comment: the application's comment

           Default: filename,name,generic

       --password=[CHARACTER]
           Password input. Render all typed text as CHARACTER. If CHARACTER is
           omitted, a * will be used.

       -T,--terminal=TERMINAL ARGS
           Command to launch XDG applications with the property Terminal=true
           (htop, for example). Example: xterm -e. Default: not set.

       -a,--anchor=ANCHOR
           Set window anchor, i.e. where on screen the window will be
           displayed.  You can choose one from:

           •   top-left
           •   top
           •   top-right
           •   left
           •   center
           •   right
           •   bottom-left
           •   bottom
           •   bottom-right

           Default: center

       --x-margin=MARGIN
           Horizontal margin away from the anchor point in pixels. Default: 0.

           Note: this option has no effect when anchor=center, top or bottom.

       --y-margin=MARGIN
           Vertical margin away from the anchor point in pixels. Default: 0.

           Note: this option has no effect when anchor=center, left or right.

       --select=STRING
           Select the first entry that matches the given string (case
           insensitive).

       --select-index=INDEX
           Select the entry with index, not compatible with --select.

       -l,--lines=COUNT
           The (maximum) number of matches to display. This dictates the
           window height. Default: 15.

       -w,--width
           Window width, in characters. Margins and borders not included.
           Default: 30.

       --tabs=COUNT
           Number of spaces a tab is expanded to. Default: 8.

       -x,--horizontal-pad=PAD
           Horizontal padding between border and icons and text. In pixels,
           subject to output scaling. Default: 40.

       -y,--vertical-pad=PAD
           Vertical padding between border and text. In pixels, subject to
           output scaling. Default: 8.

       -P,--inner-pad=PAD
           Vertical padding between prompt and match list. In pixels, subject
           to output scaling. Default: 0.

       -b,--background=HEX
           Background color. See COLORS. Default: fdf6e3ff.

       -t,--text-color=HEX
           Text color. See COLORS. Default: 657b83ff.

       --prompt-color=HEX

           Default: 586e75ff.

       --placeholder-color=HEX
           Text (foreground) color of the placeholder string. See COLORS.
           Default: 93a1a1ff.

       --input-color=HEX
           Text (foreground) color of input string. See COLORS. Default:
           657b83ff.

       -m,--match-color=HEX
           The color of matching substring(s). As you start typing in the
           search box, the matching part in each application's name is
           highlighted with this color. See COLORS. Default: cb4b16ff.

       -s,--selection-color=HEX
           The color to use as background of the currently selected
           application. See COLORS. Default: eee8d5ff.

           COLORS. Default: cb4b16ff.

       --counter-color=HEX
           The color of the match count stats printed at the right-hand side
           of the input prompt. See COLORS. Default: 93a1a1ff.

       -B,--border-width=INT
           The width of the surrounding border, in pixels (subject to output
           scaling). Default: 1.

       -r,--border-radius=INT
           The corner curvature, subject to output scaling. Larger means more
           rounded corners. 0 disables rounded corners. Default: 10.

       -C,--border-color=HEX
           The color of the border. See COLORS. Default: 002b36ff.

       --show-actions
           Include desktop actions in the list. Desktop actions are
           alternative actions some desktop entries have. Examples include
           "New Window", "New Document", etc.

       --match-mode=exact|fzf|fuzzy
           Defines how what you type is matched. See fuzzel.ini(5) for
           details. The default is fzf.

       --no-sort
           Do not sort the result.

       --counter
           Display the match count.

       --filter-desktop=[no]
           Filter the visible desktop entries based on the value of
           XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP. If the optional parameter is "no", explicitly
           disables filtering.

       --fuzzy-min-length=VALUE
           Search strings shorter than this will not by fuzzy matched.
           Default: 3.

       --fuzzy-max-length-discrepancy=VALUE
           Maximum allowed length difference between the search string, and a
           fuzzy match. Larger values result in more fuzzy matches. Default:
           2.

       --fuzzy-max-distance=VALUE
           Maximum allowed levenshtein distance between the search string, and
           a fuzzy match. Larger values result in more fuzzy matches. Default:
           1.

       --line-height=HEIGHT
           Override line height from font metrics. In points by default, but
           can be specified as pixels by appending 'px' (i.e. --line-
           height=16px). Default: not set.

       --letter-spacing=AMOUNT
           Additional space between letters. In points by default, but can be
           specified as pixels by appending 'px' (i.e. letter-spacing=5px).
           Negative values are supported. Default: 0.

       --layer=top|overlay
           Which layer to render the fuzzel window on. Valid values are top
           and overlay.

           top renders above normal windows, but typically below fullscreen
           windows and lock screens.

           overlay renders on top of both normal windows and fullscreen
           windows. Note that the order is undefined if several windows use
           the same layer. Since e.g. lock screens typically use overlay, that
           means fuzzel may or may not appear on top of a lock screen.

           Default: top

       --keyboard-focus=exclusive|on-demand
           Keyboard focusing mode, valid modes are exclusive and on-demand.

           exclusive locks keyboard focus to fuzzel, receiving all keyboard
           input until closed.

           on-demand makes fuzzel focus like a regular window, allowing other
           windows to take keyboard focus by e.g. clicking on them. By default
           switching keyboard focus will immediately close fuzzel, using --no-
           exit-on-keyboard-focus-loss allows interacting with other windows
           while fuzzel is open.

           Default: exclusive

       --no-exit-on-keyboard-focus-loss
           Do not exit when losing keyboard focus. This can be useful on
           compositors where enabling "focus-follows-mouse" causes fuzzel to
           exit as soon as the mouse is moved over another window. Sway (at
           least up to, and including 1.7) exhibits this behavior.

       --launch-prefix=COMMAND
           Command to launch XDG applications with. If set, fuzzel will pass
           the Desktop File ID of the chosen application (see the Desktop
           Entry specification) in the FUZZEL_DESKTOP_FILE_ID environment
           variables. Default: not set.

       --list-executables-in-path
           Include executables from the PATH environment variable. Applies to
           the normal application mode, not the dmenu mode.

       --render-workers=COUNT
           Number of threads to use for rendering. Set to 0 to disable
           multithreading. Default: the number of available logical CPUs
           (including SMT). Note that this is not always the best value. In
           some cases, the number of physical cores is better.

       --match-workers=COUNT
           Number of threads to use for matching. Set to 0 to disable
           multithreading. Default: the number of available logical CPUs
           (including SMT). Note that this is not always the best value. In
           some cases, the number of physical cores is better.

       --delayed-filter-ms=TIME_MS
           Time, in milliseconds, to delay refiltering when there are more
           matches than --delayed-filter-limit. Default: 300.

       --delayed-filter-limit=N
           When there are more matches than this, switch from immediate
           refiltering to delayed refiltering (see --delayed-filter-ms).
           Default: 20000.

       -d,--dmenu
           dmenu compatibility mode. In this mode, the list entries are read
           from stdin (newline separated). The selected entry is printed to
           stdout. If the input string does not match any of the entries, the
           input string is printed as is on stdout.

           Alternatively, you can symlink the fuzzel binary to dmenu. Fuzzel
           will then start in dmenu mode, without the --dmenu argument.

           Fuzzel also supports icons, using Rofi's extended dmenu protocol.
           To set an icon for an entry, append \0icon\x1f<icon-name>. Example:

               echo -en "Firefox\0icon\x1ffirefox" | fuzzel --dmenu

       --dmenu0
           Like --dmenu, but input is NUL separated instead of newline
           separated. Note that in this mode, icons are not supported.

       --index
           Print selected entry's index instead of its text. Index values
           start with zero for the first entry. dmenu mode only.

       --with-nth=N
           Display the N:th column (tab separated) of each input line. When
           selected, the full input line is printed on stdout. dmenu mode
           only.

           Example:
               printf "1tFirstn2tSecond" | fuzzel -d --with-nth=2

           This will display the entries First and Second. When one of them is
           selected, the full input line (tabs included) are printed on
           stdout.

           Setting it to 0 is the same as not specifying --with-nth at all.

       --accept-nth=N
           Output the N:th column (tab separated) of each input line to
           stdout. dmenu mode only.

           Example:
               printf "1tFirstn2tSecond" | fuzzel -d --accept-nth=2

           This will display the entries 1   First and 2   Second. Depending
           on which one is selected, First or Second will be printed to
           stdout.

           Setting it to 0 is the same as not specifying --accept-nth at all.

       -R,--no-run-if-empty
           Exit immediately, without showing the UI, if stdin is empty. dmenu
           mode only.

       --log-level={info,warning,error,none}
           Log level, used both for log output on stderr as well as syslog.
           Default: warning.

       --log-colorize=[{never,always,auto}]
           Enables or disables colorization of log output on stderr.

       --log-no-syslog
           Disables syslog logging. Logging is only done on stderr.

       -v,--version
           Show the version number and quit

CONFIGURATION
       fuzzel will search for a configuration file in the following locations,
       in this order:

           •   XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fuzzel/fuzzel.ini (defaulting to
               ~/.config/fuzzel/fuzzel.ini if unset)
           •   XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/fuzzel/fuzzel.ini (defaulting to
               /usr/local/etc/xdg/fuzzel/fuzzel.ini if unset)

       An example configuration file containing all options with their default
       value commented out will usually be installed to
       /usr/local/etc/xdg/fuzzel/fuzzel.ini.

       For more information, see fuzzel.ini(5).

LOCALIZATION
       Fuzzel uses the localized strings from the .desktop files by default.
       To disable this, run fuzzel with LC_MESSAGES=C.

FONT FORMAT
       The font is specified in FontConfig syntax. That is, a colon-separated
       list of font name and font options.

       Examples:
       •   Dina:weight=bold:slant=italic
       •   Arial:size=12

COLORS
       All colors must be specified as a RGBA quadruple, in hex format,
       without a leading '0x'.

       EXAMPLES:
       •   white: ffffffff (no transparency)
       •   black: 000000ff (no transparency)
       •   black: 00000010 (semi-transparent)
       •   red: ff0000ff (no transparency)

       The default color scheme is Solarized.

FILES
       $XDG_CACHE_HOME/fuzzel
           Stores a list of applications and their launch count. This allows
           fuzzel to sort frequently launched applications at the top.

       $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/fuzzel-$WAYLAND_DISPLAY.lock
           Lock file, used to prevent multiple fuzzel instances from running
           at the same time.
