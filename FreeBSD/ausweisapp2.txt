DESCRIPTION
       AusweisApp allows you to authenticate yourself against websites via
       your German ID card and residence permits.

       You will need:
       * an ID card that is enabled for online identification
       * A compatible NFC device (most NFC readers should work, NFC-enabled
       phones can * also be used)
       * AusweisApp
       * A browser
       * A website that supports authentication via German ID card

       When you visit such a website, AusweisApp will be triggered and will
       ask you if you want to authenticate against the website.

       This program will provide a local webserver for your browser to
       interface against.


OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Displays a short help message.


       --help-all
              Displays help including Qt specific options.


       -v, --version
              Displays version information.


       --keep
              By default, AusweisApp writes a log to a file matching
              ${TMP}/AusweisApp.*.log. When the program terminates, it will be
              deleted. This setting prevents deletion.


       --no-logfile
              Suppress writing a log file to ${TMP}/AusweisApp.*.log. Logs
              will still be written to STDOUT.


       --no-loghandler
              Disable default log handler. This disables logging to STDOUT.


       --show Show window on startup.


       --no-proxy
              Disable system proxy.


       --ui { qml|webservice|websocket }
              This option allows multiple values.  - "qml" will start the
              program with a visible UI.  - "websocket" will let it start in
              the background as an SDK. This is only useful when integrating
              AusweisApp into other programs.  - "webservice" starts listening
              on given port/address.

              Default is "qml,webservice,websocket".


       --port PORT
              Change the listening port for the WebSocket. Default is 24727.
              Selecting "0" is a special case. AusweisApp will then select a
              random port and write the port number to a file in
              ${TMP}/AusweisApp.<PID>.port.


       --address ADDRESS
              Use given addresses for interface binding. Normally AusweisApp
              is bound to localhost only as it is a security requirement.
              Useful for testing only.  This option allows multiple values.


RETURN VALUE
       AusweisApp will return 0 when successfully terminated.

ENVIRONMENT
       QT_QPA_PLATFORM={ wayland|X11 }
              You may force the session type to wayland or X11. This is only
              needed for debugging purposes. XDG_SESSION_TYPE will be ignored
              on gnome.


FILES
       ~/.config/AusweisApp_CE/AusweisApp2.conf File path where the user
       config is saved.


CAVEATS
       Currently there is no way to terminate the program on gnome as the
       TrayIcon is mandatory.
