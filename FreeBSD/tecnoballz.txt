SYNOPSIS
         tecnoballz [options]

DESCRIPTION
       TecnoballZ is a "breaking blocks" game that was first written for the
       Amiga platform.

       You'll need to break all the blocks in each level. The game is divided
       into Areas which are divided into Levels.  Between some levels, you
       have to defeat a guardian to pass to the next level.  When passing an
       Area, a new edge is open. You can buy weapons and bonus between levels
       with the money earned during the game.
