AXE(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 AXE(4)

NAME
     axe – ASIX Electronics AX88x7x/760 USB Ethernet driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device ehci
           device uhci
           device ohci
           device usb
           device miibus
           device uether
           device axe

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_axe_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The axe driver provides support for USB Ethernet adapters based on the
     ASIX Electronics AX88172, AX88178, AX88772, AX88772A, AX88772B and
     AX88760 USB 2.0 chipsets.

     The AX88172, AX88772, AX88772A, AX88772B and AX88760 contain a 10/100
     Ethernet MAC with MII interface and are designed to work with both
     Ethernet and HomePNA transceivers.  The AX88178 has a 10/100/1000
     Ethernet MAC with GMII/RGMII interface for interfacing with Gigabit
     Ethernet PHY.

     These devices will operate with both USB 1.x and USB 2.0 controllers,
     however performance with 1.x controllers will be limited since the USB
     1.x standard specifies a maximum transfer speed of 12Mbps.  Users with
     USB 1.x controllers should therefore not expect to actually achieve
     100Mbps speeds with these devices.

     All chipsets support a 64-bit multicast hash table, single perfect filter
     entry for the station address, all-multicast mode and promiscuous mode.
     Packets are received and transmitted over separate USB bulk transfer
     endpoints.

     The axe driver supports the following media types:

     autoselect       Enable autoselection of the media type and options.  The
                      user can manually override the autoselected mode by
                      adding media options to rc.conf(5).

     10baseT/UTP      Set 10Mbps operation.  The ifconfig(8) mediaopt option
                      can also be used to select either full-duplex or
                      half-duplex modes.

     100baseTX        Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.  The ifconfig(8)
                      mediaopt option can also be used to select either
                      full-duplex or half-duplex modes.

     1000baseT        Set 1000Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) operation (AX88178
                      only).  The ifconfig(8) mediaopt option can also be used
                      to select either full-duplex or half-duplex modes.

     The axe driver supports the following media options:

     full-duplex      Force full duplex operation.

     half-duplex      Force half duplex operation.

     For more information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

DIAGNOSTICS
     axe%d: watchdog timeout  A packet was queued for transmission and a
     transmit command was issued, however the device failed to acknowledge the
     transmission before a timeout expired.

     axe%d: no memory for rx list  The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for
     the receiver ring.
