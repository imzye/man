NAME
       WWW::FreeProxy - fetch proxies from free proxy lists

SYNOPSIS
               use WWW::FreeProxy;

               fetch_proxies {
                       # do whatever you need to do when new proxy is found
                       my $proxy = shift;
                       print "found new proxy: $proxy\n";
               };

OVERVIEW
       When the module is included it searches for all WWW::FreeProxy::*
       modules in @INC and loads them as plugins. It means that you can add
       your own plugins as ./WWW/FreeProxy/YourPlugin.pm. After that any calls
       to fetch_proxies() will go through all loaded plugins and call fetch()
       from them to get more proxies.

PLUGIN FORMAT
               package WWW::FreeProxy::SamplePlugin;

               sub fetch {
                       my ($self, $callback) = @_;
                       # find some proxies
                       &$callback($_) foreach @proxies;
               }

FUNCTIONS
   plugins()
       Lists all currently loaded plugins.

   fetch_proxies(&)
       Fetches proxies. In order to save memory proxies are not returned as a
       list, but are reported through a callback function one by one instead.
