NVD(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 NVD(4)

NAME
     nvd – NVM Express disk driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into your kernel, place the following lines in
     your kernel configuration file:

           device nvme
           device nvd

     Or, to load the driver as a module at boot, place the following lines in
     loader.conf(5):

           nvme_load="YES"
           nvd_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The nvd driver exposes NVM Express (NVMe) namespaces as disks to the
     kernel disk storage API.  It depends on the nvme(4) driver for
     notification of existing NVMe namespaces and submission of NVM I/O
     commands.

     Device nodes from the nvd driver will have the format /dev/nvdX and are
     GEOM(4) disks which can be partitioned by geom(8).  Note that device
     nodes from the nvme(4) driver are not GEOM(4) disks and cannot be
     partitioned.

CONFIGURATION
     The nvd driver defines a system-wide maximum delete size for NVMe
     devices.  The default is 1GB.  To select a different value, set the
     following tunable in loader.conf(5):

           hw.nvd.delete_max=<delete size in bytes>

SEE ALSO
     GEOM(4), nda(4), nvme(4), geom(8), nvmecontrol(8), disk(9)

HISTORY
     The nvd driver first appeared in FreeBSD 9.2.

AUTHORS
     The nvd driver was developed by Intel and originally written by Jim
     Harris <jimharris@FreeBSD.org>, with contributions from Joe Golio at EMC.
