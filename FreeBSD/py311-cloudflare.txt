DESCRIPTION
       cli4 provides command line access to Cloudflare v4 API


OPTIONS
       [-V, --version]
              Display program version number and exit.

       [-h, --help]
              This information (in a terse form).

       [-v, --verbose]
              Provide some protcol debugging information.

       [-e, --example]
              Show the path to the examples folder/directory.

       [-q, --quiet]
              Don't output any JSON/YAML responses.

       [-j, --json]
              Output response data in JSON format (the default).

       [-y, --yaml]
              Output response data in YAML format (if yaml package installed).

       [-n, --ndjson]
              Output response data in NDJSON format (if jsonlines package
              installed).

       [-r, --raw]
              Output JSON results in raw mode without splitting out the errors
              and results.

       [-i, --image]
              Output results as binary (i.e. it's an image).  This isn't
              normally needed as the API returns a Content-Type to indicate an
              image is being returned.  This option can be used to allow the
              API output to be output without any processing (i.e. JSON
              formatted).

       [-d, --dump]
              Output a list of all API calls included in the code.

       [-b, --binary]
              Open files in binary mode.

       [-A openapi-url, --openapi openapi-url]
              Decode Cloudflare's OpenAPI spec and output all the known
              commands.

       [-p profile-name, --profile profile-name]
              Select a profile-name from the configuration file (hence select
              custom email/token values).

       --get  Send HTTP request as a GET (the default).

       --patch
              Send HTTP request as a PATCH.

       --post Send HTTP request as a POST.

       --put  Send HTTP request as a PUT.

       --delete
              Send HTTP request as a DELETE.

       item=value
              Set a paramater or data value to send with a GET, PATCH, POST,
              PUT or DELETE command. The value is sent as a string.

       item:=value
              Set a paramater or data value to send with a GET, PATCH, POST,
              PUT or DELETE command. The value is sent as an interger.

       item=@filename
              Set a paramater or data value to send with a POST or PUT
              command. The value is based on the content of the file.

       /command ...
              The API command(s) to execute.


COMMAND(S)
       The command string uses slash (/) to seperate the verbs in the same way
       that the Cloudflare v4 API documentation does.  Any verb starting with
       colon (:) is either converted to zone_id, user_id, organtization_id, or
       otherwise.  Any verb starting with coloe (:) and followed by 32 hex
       chracters is passed thru raw.  Any verb starting with two colons (::)
       is passed thru raw.


RESULTS
       The output is either JSON or YAML formatted.
