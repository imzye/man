NAME
       squid_radius_auth - Squid RADIUS authentication helper

SYNOPSIS
       squid_radius_auth -f configfile
       squid_radius_auth -h "server" [-p port] [-i identifier] -w secret

DESCRIPTION
       This helper allows Squid to connect to a RADIUS server to validate the
       user name and password of Basic HTTP authentication.

       -f configfile
              Specifies the path to a configuration file. See the
              CONFIGURATION section for details.

       -h server
              Alternative method of specifying the server to connect to

       -p port
              Specify another server port where the RADIUS server listens for
              requests if different from the default RADIUS port.  Normally
              not specified.

       -i identifier
              Unique identifier identifying this Squid proxy to the RADIUS
              server.  If not specified the IP address is used as to identify
              the proxy.

       -w secret
              Alternative method of specifying the shared secret. Using the
              configuration file is generally more secure and recommended.

       -t timeout
              RADIUS request timeout. Default 10 seconds.

CONFIGURATION
       The configuration specifies how the helper connects to RADIUS.  The
       file contains a list of directives (one per line). Lines beginning with
       a # is ignored.

       server radiusserver
              specifies the name or address of the RADIUS server to connect
              to.

       secret somesecretstring
              specifies the shared RADIUS secret.

       identifier nameofserver
              specifies what the proxy should identify itsels as to the RADIUS
              server.  This directive is optional.

       port portnumber
              Specifies the port number or service name where the helper
              should connect.
