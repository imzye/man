NAME
       folialint ‐ check validity of FoLiA documents

SYNOPSIS
       folialint [options] FILE(S)

DESCRIPTION
       folialint will check the validity of FoLiA files on a surface level:

       ‐ Is the tag structure according to the definition?

       ‐ Are all required elements and attributes present?

       ‐ Are the attributes and values valid?

       ‐ Are all annotations correctly declared?

       ‐ Is all text consistent?

OPTIONS
       --output file
              write output to 'file'. (default is stdout).  Assumes only 1
              inputfile.
       --nooutput
              suppress al output except errors
       --nochecktext
              Disable checking text consistency. (for older FoLiA versions
              this wasn't forced to be so. Which is wrong )
       --fixtext
              Attempt to fix text problems like wrong offset's. Might be
              dangerous, and the default is to DON'T do it.
       -a or --autodeclare
              Attempt to automaticly fix missing annotations. (default: false)
       --strip
              strip all information from the file that makes comparison hard.
              Notably date/time information.  This also enable '--canonical'
              output, meaning that otherwise unsorted tags are output in the
              same order every time.
       --permissive
              Accept documents with missing namespace declarations.
       --warn
              add some extra (warning) checks:

              ‐ About unused set declarations

              ‐ About possible incompatabilities between the current library
              version and the document version.
       --canonical or --KANON
              output annotation declarations and FoLiA nodes in a fixed
              (canonical) order.  This might make tree comparisons easier.
       -d or --debug level
              run with a debug level of level
       -V or --version
              Show VERSION
       -h or --help
              Show some help

BUGS
       possible
