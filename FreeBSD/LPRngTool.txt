NAME
       lprngtool - configuration and Graphics User Interface for LPRng

SYNOPSIS
       lprngtool [ -V ]

DESCRIPTION
       The lprngtool is a Tcl/Tk GUI which allows you to add/delete/modify
       local printers, and monitor and manage local and remote print queues
       using LPRng.  LPRngTool does NOT work with Berkeley or Sys V style
       printing!  You must have LPRng installed to make use of LPRngTool.  If
       you want to control Berkeley lpd spools, use Red Hat's Printtool.

HISTORY
       LPRng is a enhanced printer spooler system with functionality similar
       to the Berkeley LPR software.  The LPRng mailing list is
       lprng@lprng.com; subscribe by sending mail to lprng-request@lprng.com
       with the word subscribe in the body.  The software is available from

       The LPRngTool code was based on the RedHat printtool code, as modified
       and updated by Geoff Silver <geoff@uslinux.net>.  It was then further
       modified by Patrick Powell <papowell@astart.com>.
