SYNOPSIS

          print &genders();

DESCRIPTION
       Small module for inflecting pronouns for a bunch of different genders.

       Genders currently supported are:
          neuter
          male
          female
          either
          spivak
          splat
          plural
          egotistical
          royal
          2nd
          sie/hir
          zie/zir

FUNCTIONS
       pronoun ( TYPE, GENDER )
           Returns the appropriate pronoun word for that pronoun type and
           gender.

           The types (examples for the male gender in brackets) are:
              subjective ("he")
              objective ("him")
              posessive-subjective ("his")
              posessive-objective ("his")
              reflexive ("himself")

           Simply returns an array containing all the valid genders.

           Returns true/false depending if the argument is a gender we know
           about.  Case is not significant.
