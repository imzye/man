NAME
       dpipe - bi-directional pipe command

SYNOPSIS
       dpipe [ command [ args ] ] = [ command [ args ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       dpipe is a general tool to run two commands diverting the standard
       output of the first command into the standard input of the second and
       viceversa.  It is the bi-directional extension of the | (pipe) syntax
       used by all the shells.  The = has been chosen as a metaphore of two
       parallel communication lines between the commands.
       It has been written as a tool for the Virtual Distributed Ethernet.

OPTIONS
