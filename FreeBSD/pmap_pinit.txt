NAME
     pmap_pinit, pmap_pinit0 – initialize pmap structures

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <vm/vm.h>
     #include <vm/pmap.h>

     void
     pmap_pinit(pmap_t pmap);

     void
     pmap_pinit0(pmap_t pm);

DESCRIPTION
     The pmap_pinit() function initializes the preallocated and zeroed
     structure pmap, such as one in a vmspace structure.

     The pmap_pinit0() function initializes the physical map pm, associated
     with process 0, the first process created in the system.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
     The pmap_pinit2() function has been deprecated, and should be implemented
     as a stub until further notice.
