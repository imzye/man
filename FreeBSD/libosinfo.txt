NAME
       osinfo-detect - Detect the operating system on installable media or
       trees

SYNOPSIS
       osinfo-detect [OPTIONS...] PATH|URI

DESCRIPTION
       Examine the "PATH" or "URI" to determine what (if any) operating system
       it is for, and whether it is installable or is a Live image.  By
       default "PATH" or "URI" will be interpreted as pointing to ISO media.
       To request examination of an install tree instead, the option
       --type=tree should be given.

       The output information is formatted for humans;

OPTIONS
       --format=plain
       --type=media|tree
               Switch between looking for CD/DVD ISO media (media, the
               default) or install trees (tree)

       --all   Report all operating systems with matching media, instead of
               only the first match.

EXIT STATUS
       The exit status will be 0 if an operating system was detected, or 1 if
       none was found.
