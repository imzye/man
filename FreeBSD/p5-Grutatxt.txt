NAME
       Grutatxt - Text to HTML (and other formats) converter

SYNOPSIS
        use Grutatxt;

        # create a new Grutatxt converter object
        $grutatxt = new Grutatxt();

        # process a Grutatxt format string
        @output = $grutatxt->process($text);

        # idem for a file
        @output2 = $grutatxt->process_file($file);

DESCRIPTION
       Grutatxt is a module to process text documents in a special markup
       format (also called Grutatxt), very similar to plain ASCII text. These
       documents can be converted to HTML, troff or man.

       The markup is designed to be fairly intuitive and straightforward and
       can include headings, bold and italic text effects, bulleted, numbered
       and definition lists, URLs, function and variable names, preformatted
       text, horizontal separators and tables. Special marks can be inserted
       in the text and a heading-based structural index can be obtained from
       it.

       A comprehensive description of the markup is defined in the README
       file, included with the Grutatxt package (it is written in Grutatxt
       format itself, so it can be converted using the grutatxt tool to any of
       the supported formats).  The latest version (and more information) can
       be retrieved from the Grutatxt home page at:

        http://triptico.com/software/grutatxt.html

FUNCTIONS AND METHODS
   new
        $grutatxt = new Grutatxt([ "mode"  => $mode, ]
                   [ "title" => \$title, ]
                   [ "marks" => \@marks, ]
                   [ "index" => \@index, ]
                   [ "abstract" => \$abstract, ]
                   [ "strip-parens" => $bool, ]
                   [ "strip-dollars" => $bool, ]
                   [ %driver_specific_arguments ] );

       Creates a new Grutatxt object instance. All parameters are optional.

       mode
           Output format. Can be HTML, troff or man. HTML is used if not
           specified.

       title
           If title is specified as a reference to scalar, the first level 1
           heading found in the text is stored inside it.

       marks
           Marks in the Grutatxt markup are created by inserting the string
           <-> alone in a line. If marks is specified as a reference to array,
           it will be filled with the subscripts (relative to the output
           array) of the lines where the marks are found in the text.

       index
           If index is specified as a reference to array, it will be filled
           with two element arrayrefs with the level as first argument and the
           heading as second.

           This information can be used to build a table of contents of the
           processed text.

       strip-parens
           Function names in the Grutatxt markup are strings of alphanumeric
           characters immediately followed by a pair of open and close
           parentheses. If this boolean value is set, function names found in
           the processed text will have their parentheses deleted.

       strip-dollars
           Variable names in the Grutatxt markup are strings of alphanumeric
           characters preceded by a dollar sign.  If this boolean value is
           set, variable names found in the processed text will have the
           dollar sign deleted.

       abstract
           The abstract of a Grutatxt document is the fragment of text from
           the beginning of the document to the end of the first paragraph
           after the title. If abstract is specified as a reference to scalar,
           it will contain (after each call to the process() method) the
           subscript of the element of the output array that marks the end of
           the subject.

       no-pure-verbatim
           Since version 2.0.15, text effects as italics and bold are not
           processed in verbatim (preformatted) mode. If you want to revert to
           the old behaviour, use this option.

       toc If set, a table of contents will be generated after the abstract.
           The table of contents will be elaborated using headings from 2 and
           3 levels.

   process
        @output = $grutatxt->process($text);

       Processes a text in Grutatxt format. The result is returned as an array
       of lines.

   process_file
        @output = $grutatxt->process_file($filename);

       Processes a file in Grutatxt format.

DRIVER SPECIFIC INFORMATION
   HTML Driver
       The additional parameters for a new Grutatxt object are:

       table-headers
           If this boolean value is set, the first row in tables is assumed to
           be the heading and rendered using 'th' instead of 'td' tags.

       center-tables
           If this boolean value is set, tables are centered.

       expand-tables
           If this boolean value is set, tables are expanded (width 100%).

       dl-as-dl
           If this boolean value is set, definition lists will be rendered
           using 'dl', 'dt' and 'dd' instead of tables.

       header-offset
           Offset to be summed to the heading level when rendering 'h?' tags
           (default is 0).

       class-oddeven
           If this boolean value is set, tables will be rendered with an
           "oddeven" CSS class, and rows alternately classed as "even" or
           "odd". If it's not set, no CSS class info is added to tables.

       url-label-max
           If an URL without label is given (that is, the URL itself is used
           as the label), it's trimmed to have as much characters as this
           value says. By default it's 80.

   troff Driver
       The troff driver uses the -me macros and tbl. A good way to post-
       process this output (to PostScript in the example) could be by using

        groff -t -me -Tps

       The additional parameters for a new Grutatxt object are:

       normal-size
           The point size of normal text. By default is 10.

       heading-sizes
           This argument must be a reference to an array containing the size
           in points of the 3 different heading levels. By default, level
           sizes are [ 20, 18, 15 ].

       table-type
           The type of table to be rendered by tbl. Can be allbox (all lines
           rendered; this is the default value), box (only outlined) or
           doublebox (only outlined by a double line).

   man Driver
       The man driver is used to generate Unix-like man pages. Note that all
       headings have the same level with this output driver.

       The additional parameters for a new Grutatxt object are:

       section
           The man page section (see man documentation). By default is 1.

       page-name
           The name of the page. This is usually the name of the program or
           function the man page is documenting and will be shown in the page
           header. By default is the empty string.

   LaTeX Driver
       The additional parameters for a new Grutatxt object are:

       docclass
           The LaTeX document class. By default is 'report'. You can also use
           'article' or 'book' (consult your LaTeX documentation for details).

       papersize
           The paper size to be used in the document. By default is 'a4paper'.

       encoding
           The character encoding used in the document. By default is
           'latin1'.

       Note that you can't nest further than 4 levels in LaTeX; if you do,
       LaTeX will choke in the generated code with a 'Too deeply nested'
       error.

   RTF Driver
       The additional parameters for a new Grutatxt object are:

       normal-size
           The point size of normal text. By default is 20.

       heading-sizes
           This argument must be a reference to an array containing the size
           in points of the 3 different heading levels. By default, level
           sizes are [ 34, 30, 28 ].
