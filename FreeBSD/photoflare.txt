NAME
       photoflare - Simple but powerful Cross Platform Image Editor

DESCRIPTION
       This is an effort to bring quick, simple but powerful image editing to
       the masses. Photoflare is inspired by the image editor currently only
       available on Microsoft Windows – PhotoFiltre. However, it will not be a
       straight clone.  It is being built from the ground up to be much
       improved and cross platform too!
