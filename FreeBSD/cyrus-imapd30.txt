NAME
       httptest - Cyrus IMAP documentation

       Interactive HTTP test program.

SYNOPSIS
       httptest [ -t keyfile ] [ -p port ] [ -m mechanism ] [ -a userid ]
           [ -u userid ] [ -k num ] [ -l num ] [ -r realm ] [ -f file ]
           [ -n num ] [ -s ] [ -c ] [ -i ] [ -v ] [ -w passwd ] [ -o option=value ] hostname

DESCRIPTION
       This is actually installed as a hard linked copy of imtest(1).

       httptest is a utility that allows you to authenticate to a HTTP server
       and interactively issue requests to it. Once authenticated you may
       issue any HTTP request by simply typing it in.  It is capable of
       multiple SASL authentication mechanisms and handles encryption layers
       transparently. This utility is often used for testing the operation of
       an http server. Also those developing HTTP clients find it useful.

OPTIONS

       -t keyfile
              Enable TLS.  keyfile contains the TLS public and private keys.
              Specify “” to negotiate a TLS encryption layer but not use TLS
              authentication.

       -p port
              Port to connect to. If left off this defaults to http as defined
              in /etc/services.

       -m mechanism
              Force httptest to use mechanism for authentication. If not
              specified, the strongest authentication mechanism supported by
              the server is chosen.  Specify one of Basic, Digest, NTLM, or
              Negotiate (GSS-SPNEGO).

       -a userid
              Userid to use for authentication; defaults to the current user.
              This is the userid whose password or credentials will be
              presented to the server for verification.

       -u userid
              Userid to use for authorization; defaults to the current user.
              This is the userid whose identity will be assumed after
              authentication.

       -k num Minimum protection layer required.

       -l num Maximum protection layer to use (0=none; 1=integrity; etc).  For
              example if you are using the KERBEROS_V4 authentication
              mechanism specifying 0 will force imtest to not use any layer
              and specifying 1 will force it to use the integrity layer.  By
              default the maximum supported protection layer will be used.

       -r realm
              Specify the realm to use. Certain authentication mechanisms
              (e.g. DIGEST-MD5) may require one to specify the realm.

       -f file
              Pipe file into connection after authentication.

       -n num Number of authentication attempts; default = 1.  The client will
              attempt to do SSL/TLS session reuse and/or fast reauth (e.g.
              DIGEST-MD5), if possible.

       -s     Enable HTTP over SSL (https).

       -c     Enable challenge prompt callbacks.  This will cause the OTP
              mechanism to ask for the the one-time password instead of the
              secret pass-phrase (library generates the correct response).

       -i     Don’t send an initial client response for SASL mechanisms, even
              if the protocol supports it.

       -v     Verbose. Print out more information than usual.

       -w     Password to use (if not supplied, we will prompt).

       -o option=value
              Set the SASL option to value.
