Math::Symbolic::Custom::Contains(3)        User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Math::Symbolic::Custom::Contains - Find subtrees in Math::Symbolic
       expressions

SYNOPSIS
         use Math::Symbolic qw/:all/;
         use Math::Symbolic::Custom::Contains;

         my $formula = parse_from_string('a*b+c');

         print 'found product' if $formula->contains_operator(B_PRODUCT);
         # works
         print 'found division' if $formula->contains_operator(B_DIVISION);

DESCRIPTION
       This module extends the functionality of Math::Symbolic by offering
       facilities to test a Math::Symbolic tree for existance of a specific
       subtree in the Math::Symbolic tree.

       As of version 0.10, this has only been implemented for operators via
       the contains_operator method.

       The module adds methods to all Math::Symbolic objects.

   $ms_tree->contains_operator( [Operator type] )
       This method does not modify the Math::Symbolic tree itself, but instead
       tests the tree for existance of an operator of the specified operator
       type. It returns undef if no such operator exists in the tree and
       returns a reference to the first occurrance of the operator if there
       are such operators.

       Operator types are constants exported by Math::Symbolic. Please refer
       to the Math::Symbolic manual for details.

       If the operator type is omitted, the match will be performed for any
       operator. That means if the tree contains any operators at all, a
       reference to the top-most operator will be returned. (Which will always
       be the top-most node of the tree anyway.)
