AMDTEMP(4)             FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual             AMDTEMP(4)

NAME
     amdtemp – device driver for AMD processor on-die digital thermal sensor

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following line in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device amdtemp

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           amdtemp_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The amdtemp driver provides support for the on-die digital thermal sensor
     present in AMD Family 0Fh, 10h, 11h, 12h, 14h, 15h, 16h, and 17h
     processors.

     For Family 0Fh processors, the amdtemp driver reports each core's
     temperature through sysctl nodes, named
     dev.amdtemp.%d.core{0,1}.sensor{0,1}.  The driver also creates
     dev.cpu.%d.temperature in the corresponding CPU device's sysctl tree,
     displaying the maximum temperature of the two sensors located in each CPU
     core.

     For Family 10h, 11h, 12h, 14h, 15h, 16h, and 17h processors, the driver
     reports each package's temperature through a sysctl node, named
     dev.amdtemp.%d.core0.sensor0.  The driver also creates
     dev.cpu.%d.temperature in the corresponding CPU device's sysctl tree,
     displaying the temperature of the shared sensor located in each CPU
     package.

SYSCTL VARIABLES
     The following variable is available as both sysctl(8) variable and
     loader(8) tunable:

     dev.amdtemp.%d.sensor_offset
     Add the given offset to the temperature of the sensor.  Default is 0.

SEE ALSO
     loader(8), sysctl(8)

HISTORY
     The amdtemp driver first appeared in FreeBSD 7.1.

CAVEATS
     For Family 10h and later processors, “(the reported temperature) is a
     non-physical temperature measured on an arbitrary scale and it does not
     represent an actual physical temperature like die or case temperature.
     Instead, it specifies the processor temperature relative to the point at
     which the system must supply the maximum cooling for the processor's
     specified maximum case temperature and maximum thermal power dissipation”
     according to BIOS and Kernel Developer's Guide (BKDG) for AMD Processors,
