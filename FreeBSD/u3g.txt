U3G(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 U3G(4)

NAME
     u3g – USB support for 3G datacards

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device usb
           device ucom
           device u3g

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           u3g_load="YES"

     If neither of the above is done, the driver will automatically be loaded
     by devd(8) when the device is connected.

DESCRIPTION
     The u3g driver provides support for the multiple USB-to-serial interfaces
     exposed by many 3G USB/PCCard modems.

     The device is accessed through the ucom(4) driver which makes it behave
     like a tty(4).

HARDWARE
     The u3g driver supports the following adapters:

     •   Option GT 3G Fusion, GT Fusion Quad, etc. (only 3G part, not WLAN)
     •   Option GT 3G, GT 3G Quad, etc.
     •   Vodafone Mobile Connect Card 3G
     •   Vodafone Mobile Broadband K3772-Z
     •   Qualcomm Inc. CDMA MSM
     •   QUECTEL EC25, EM05, EM12-G.
     •   Huawei B190, E180v, E220 ('<Huawei Mobile>')
     •   Novatel U740, MC950D, X950D, etc.
     •   Sierra MC875U, MC8775U, etc.

     (See /sys/dev/usb/serial/u3g.c for the complete list of supported cards
     for each vendor mentioned above.)

     The supported 3G cards provide the necessary modem port for ppp, or mpd
     connections as well as extra ports (depending on the specific device) to
     provide other functions (additional command port, diagnostic port, SIM
     toolkit port).

     In some of these devices a mass storage device supported by the umass(4)
     driver is present which contains Windows and Mac OS X drivers.  The
     device starts up in disk mode (TruInstall, ZeroCD, etc.) and requires
     additional commands to switch it to modem mode.  If your device is not
     switching automatically, please try to add quirks.  See usbconfig(8) and
     usb_quirk(4).

FILES
     /dev/ttyU*.*       for callin ports
     /dev/ttyU*.*.init
     /dev/ttyU*.*.lock  corresponding callin initial-state and lock-state
                        devices

     /dev/cuaU*.*       for callout ports
     /dev/cuaU*.*.init
     /dev/cuaU*.*.lock  corresponding callout initial-state and lock-state
                        devices

EXAMPLES
     Connect to the Internet using the default configuration:

           ppp -background u3g

HISTORY
     The u3g driver appeared in FreeBSD 7.2, is based on the uark(4) driver,
     and written by Andrea Guzzo <aguzzo@anywi.com> in September 2008.

AUTHORS
     The u3g driver was written by Andrea Guzzo <aguzzo@anywi.com> and Nick
     Hibma <n_hibma@FreeBSD.org>.  Hardware for testing was provided by AnyWi
     Technologies, Leiden, NL.

BUGS
     The automatic mode switch from disk mode to modem mode does not work
     unless the driver is either built into the kernel or loaded before the
     device is connected.
