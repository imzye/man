INTRO(1)                FreeBSD General Commands Manual               INTRO(1)

NAME
     intro – introduction to general commands (tools and utilities)

DESCRIPTION
     Section one of the manual contains most of the commands which comprise
     the BSD user environment.  Some of the commands included in section one
     are text editors, command shell interpreters, searching and sorting
     tools, file manipulation commands, system status commands, remote file
     copy commands, mail commands, compilers and compiler tools, formatted
     output tools, and line printer commands.

     All commands set a status value upon exit which may be tested to see if
     the command completed normally.  Traditionally, the value 0 signifies
     successful completion of the command, while a value >0 indicates an
     error.  Some commands attempt to describe the nature of the failure by
     using exit codes as defined in sysexits(3), while others simply set the
     status to an arbitrary value >0 (typically 1).
