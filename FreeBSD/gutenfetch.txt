GUTENFETCH
       gutenfetch - Retrieve listings and books availiable from project
       gutenberg.


SYNOPSIS
       gutenfetch [options]


OPTIONS
       -h,  --help

              Display usage and version.


       -D,  --debug

              If debugging is enabled at compile time, this option will be
              present and can be used to print all types of useful internal
              variables to see where things fail.


       -V,  --version

              Display the version of gutenfetch.


       -m,  --make-config

              Force the generation of a new ~/.gutenfetchrc file.


       -v,  --verbose

              Turn on verbose error reporting.


       -q,  --quiet

              Turn off error reporting.


       -o   <file>

       --output=<file>

              Direct output to a file, '-' is stdout, stdout is default.


       -s   <server>

       --server=<server>

              Force the use of a particular server.  The form must be in the
              form of '[http|ftp]://some.server.name/root/to/gutenberg/books/'


       -F,  --filter

              When listing available books on Project Gutenberg, this option
              will filter the file GUTINDEX.ALL to display only entries which
              it thinks are valid etexts.  This shrinks the amount of data you
              have to sift through but you miss out on other comments in the
              file.  The default is to show the whole file, unfiltered.


       -C,  --clear-filter

              When listing available books on Project Gutenberg, this option
              will prevent gutenfetch from filtering the GUTINDEX.ALL file.
              This is the default behaviour


       -l,  --list

              List all books availiable on the gutenberg server.  Consider
              using grep on the output to narrow the list such as

              gutenfetch -l | grep -i 'alice' | less

              to find "Alice in Wonderland" by Lewis Carroll

              The entry will look like this.

              Jan 1991 Alice in Wonderland, Lewis Carroll [Carroll
              #1][alicexxx.xxx] 11

              The number at the end of the line, in this case 11, is the book
              id.  You need that reference to fetch and download the ascii
              text version of the book.  Some entries have an 'A' after their
              book id.  These are books which are only available from within
              Australia.  You may have trouble fetching these texts unless you
              live in australia and have an australian server selected.  Some
              entries have a 'C' after their bookid.  These books are
              restricted in some form.  Other entries may have an '*' after
              the bookid.  These positions are reserved and the books will
              arrive soon with any luck.


       -f   <bookid>

       --fetch=<bookid>

              Fetch an etext off of the server.   To fetch and read "Alice in
              Wonderland" you would use this command.

              gutenfetch -f 11 | less


       c,   --enable-cache

              The cache is enabled by default.  This can improve performance
              by keeping copies of fetched books and indexes on your local
              disk.  Once a book or GUTINDEX.ALL is fetched it remains in the
              cache for 48 hours at which time, the program will fetch the
              latest copy of the file from the Project Gutenberg servers.


       d,   --disable-cache

              Prevent gutenfetch from caching files to the disk.  If you have
              a www proxy like squid running, this may be your prefered
              behaviour.


DIAGNOSTICS
       gutenfetch will return a value of 1 on success and a value of 0 if
       something went wrong.  This could be useful if you are building an
       application on top of gutenfetch.
