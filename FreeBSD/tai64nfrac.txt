TAI64NFRAC(1)                    User Commands                   TAI64NFRAC(1)


NAME
       tai64nfrac - Convert TAI64N timestamps to decimal seconds since epoch

SYNOPSIS
       tai64nfrac < input > output

DESCRIPTION
       Given data with TAI64N timestamps at the beginning of each line as
       input (such as data generated by multilog), tai64nfrac will convert
       those times to seconds since epoch (with a fractional part) and
       otherwise output the same data.  It's intended to be used as a filter
       that changes the timestamp format at the beginning of each line.

       tai64nfrac is primarily intended to support using qmailanalog to
       analyze qmail logs that are being written by multilog rather than to
       syslog via splogger.

BUGS
       tai64nfrac makes no attempt to handle leap seconds or to handle TAI to
       UTC conversion correctly.  It was written with hard-coded adjustments
       for systems where the system clock is in UTC and no leap seconds file
       is present.  In that situation, software generating TAI64N timestamps
       will generate timestamps with an epoch 10 seconds different than UTC,
       which tai64nfrac adjusts for.

       This is obviously not the correct approach, which would be to use the
       code and algorithms in libtai.  It was just the expedient thing to do
       for my immediate problem.

SEE ALSO
       See <http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/tai64nlocal.html> for documentation of
       tai64nlocal, which converts TAI64N timestamps to human-readable times
       in the local time zone.

       See <http://cr.yp.to/qmailanalog.html> for qmailanalog.
