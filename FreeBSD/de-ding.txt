NAME
       ding - dictionary lookup program for Unix

SYNOPSIS
       ding [options] [phrase]

DESCRIPTION
       ding is a dictionary lookup program for X Windows/Unix. It comes with a
       German-English dictionary with about 345,000 entries.

       It is based on Tk version >= 8.3 and uses the agrep(1) or egrep(1)
       tools for searching.

       In addition to this ding can also search using ispell(1) and dict(1).

       It has many configuration options, such as search preferences,
       interface language (English or German), colors. It has history and help
       functions and comes with useful key and mouse bindings for quick and
       easy lookups.

       If you enter some word or phrase as command line argument, ding will
       start up with a translation of this word/phrase.

OPTIONS
       -x, --selection
              Start searching for selected word (X selection).

       -m, --mini
              Start with minimal size (search form only).

       -r, --remote
              Start search in an already running program.

       -R, --remote-new
              Start search in an already running program or start a new
              program.

       --noconf
              Do not save preferences

       -D #, --debug #
              Start with debug output, # = number (1..15).

USAGE
       It's very simple: Start ding (via KDE menu "Tools" or via command
       line), type in search word, press ENTER, read results. Search further
       by double-clicking a word, or select a word in another window and drop
       it by clicking with mouse button 2 over the "ding window". For further
       information consult the program help by pressing F1.
