     bluetooth.protocols – Bluetooth Protocol Service Multiplexor database

DESCRIPTION
     The /etc/bluetooth/protocols file contains information regarding the
     known Bluetooth Protocol Service Multiplexor values.  For each Bluetooth
     Protocol Service Multiplexor a single line should be present with the
     following information:

           official Protocol Service Multiplexor name
           official Protocol Service Multiplexor value
           aliases

     Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or tab characters.  A ‘#’
     indicates the beginning of a comment; characters up to the end of the
     line are not interpreted by routines which search the file.

     Bluetooth Protocol Service Multiplexor names may contain any printable
     character other than a field delimiter, newline, or comment character.
