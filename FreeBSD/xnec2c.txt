DESCRIPTION
              -i|--input <input-file-name>
              -j|--jobs  <number of processors in SMP machine> (-j0 disables
              forking)
              -b|--batch:        enable batch mode, exit after the frequency
              loop runs
                 --optimize:     Activate the optimizer immediately.
              -P|--no-pthreads:  disable pthreads and use the GTK loop for
              debugging
              -h|--help:         print usage information and exit
              -V|--version:      print xnec2c version number and exit
              -v|--verbose:      increase verbosity, can be specified multiple
              times
              -d|--debug:        enable debug output (-dd includes backtraces)

              The following arguments write to an output file after the
              frequency loop completes.  These are useful to combine with
              --batch:
                --write-csv             <filename>  - write CSV file of
              measurements
                --write-s1p             <filename>  - write S1P file of
              S-parameters
                --write-s2p-max-gain    <filename>  - write S2P file, port-2
              is max-gain
                --write-s2p-viewer-gain <filename>  - write S2P file, port-2
              is viewer-gain
                --write-rdpat           <filename>  - write CSV of the
              radiation pattern
                --write-currents        <filename>  - write CSV of currents
