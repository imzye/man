NAME
       WMmp - A dockapp to interface with mpd

SYNOPSIS
       WMmp [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the WMmp command.

       WMmp is a dockapp to interface and control mpd. It is a dockapp that is
       supported by X window managers such as Window Maker, AfterStep,
       BlackBox, and Enlightenment.

       The song title and time is displayed in the top half.  The controls are
       in the bottom half and reflect settings on mpd.  It has an LCD look-
       alike user interface.  The back-light may be turned on/off by clicking
       the mouse button 3 (right) over the application.

       You must set the MPD_HOST and MPD_PORT environment variables to run
       WMmp.  (If you use a password to contact mpd, set MPD_HOST to
       "password@host".)
