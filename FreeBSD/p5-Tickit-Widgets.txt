Tickit::ContainerWidget(3)                 User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       "Tickit::ContainerWidget" - abstract base class for widgets that
       contain other widgets

SYNOPSIS
        TODO

DESCRIPTION
       This class acts as an abstract base class for widgets that contain at
       leaast one other widget object. It provides storage for a hash of
       "options" associated with each child widget.

STYLE
       The following style tags are used:

       :focus-child
           Set whenever a child widget within the container has the input
           focus.

CONSTRUCTOR
   new
          $widget = Tickit::ContainerWidget->new( %args );

       Constructs a new "Tickit::ContainerWidget" object. Must be called on a
       subclass that implements the required methods; see the SUBCLASS METHODS
       section below.

METHODS
   add
          $widget->add( $child, %opts );

       Sets the child widget's parent, stores the options for the child, and
       calls the "children_changed" method. The concrete implementation will
       have to implement storage of this child widget.

       Returns the container $widget itself, for easy chaining.

   remove
          $widget->remove( $child_or_index );

       Removes the child widget's parent, and calls the "children_changed"
       method.  The concrete implementation will have to remove this child
       from its storage.

       Returns the container $widget itself, for easy chaining.

   child_opts
          %opts = $widget->child_opts( $child );

          $opts = $widget->child_opts( $child );

       Returns the options currently set for the given child as a key/value
       list in list context, or as a HASH reference in scalar context. The
       HASH reference in scalar context is the actual hash used to store the
       options - modifications to it will be preserved.

   set_child_opts
          $widget->set_child_opts( $child, %newopts );

       Sets new options on the given child. Any options whose value is given
       as "undef" are deleted.

   find_child
          $child = $widget->find_child( $how, $other, %args );

       Returns a child widget. The $how argument determines how this is done,
       relative to the child widget given by $other:

       first
           The first child returned by "children" ($other is ignored)

       last
           The last child returned by "children" ($other is ignored)

       before
           The child widget just before $other in the order given by
           "children"

       after
           The child widget just after $other in the order given by "children"

       Takes the following named arguments:

       where => CODE
               Optional. If defined, gives a filter function to filter the
               list of children before searching for the required one. Will be
               invoked once per child, with the child widget set as $_; it
               should return a boolean value to indicate if that child should
               be included in the search.

   focus_next
          $widget->focus_next( $how, $other );

       Moves the input focus to the next widget in the widget tree, by
       searching in the direction given by $how relative to the widget given
       by $other (which must be an immediate child of $widget).

       The direction $how must be one of the following four values:

       first
       last
           Moves focus to the first or last child widget that can take focus.
           Recurses into child widgets that are themselves containers. $other
           is ignored.

       after
       before
           Moves focus to the next or previous child widget in tree order from
           the one given by $other. Recurses into child widgets that are
           themselves containers, and out into parent containers.

           These searches will wrap around the widget tree; moving "after" the
           last node in the widget tree will move to the first, and vice
           versa.

       This differs from "find_child" in that it performs a full tree search
       through the widget tree, considering parents and children. If a
       "before" or "after" search falls off the end of one node, it will
       recurse up to its parent and search within the next child, and so on.

       Usually this would be used via the widget itself:

          $self->parent->focus_next( $how => $self );

SUBCLASS METHODS
   children
          @children = $widget->children;

       Required. Should return a list of all the contained child widgets. The
       order is not specified, but should be in some stable order that makes
       sense given the layout of the widget's children.

       This method is used by "window_lost" to remove the windows from all the
       child widgets automatically, and by "find_child" to obtain a child
       relative to another given one.

   children_for_focus
          @children = $widget->children_for_focus;

       Optional. If implemented, this method is called to obtain a list of
       child widgets to perform a child search on when changing focus using
       the "focus_next" method. If it is not implemented, the regular
       "children" method is called instead.

       Normally this method shouldn't be used, but it may be useful on
       container widgets that also display "helper" widgets that should not be
       considered as part of the main focus set. This method can then exclude
       them.

   children_changed
          $widget->children_changed;

       Optional. If implemented, this method will be called after any change
       of the contained child widgets or their options. Typically this will be
       used to set windows on them by sub-dividing the window of the parent.

       If not overridden, the base implementation will call "reshape".

   child_resized
          $widget->child_resized( $child );

       Optional. If implemented, this method will be called after a child
       widget changes or may have changed its size requirements. Typically
       this will be used to adjusts the windows allocated to children.

       If not overridden, the base implementation will call "reshape".
