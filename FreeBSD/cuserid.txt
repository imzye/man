CUSERID(3)             FreeBSD Library Functions Manual             CUSERID(3)

NAME
     cuserid – get user name associated with effective UID

LIBRARY
     Compatibility Library (libcompat, -lcompat)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <stdio.h>

     char *
     cuserid(char *s);

DESCRIPTION
     The cuserid() function is made obsolete by getpwuid(3).

     The function cuserid() gets the user name associated with the effective
     UID of the current process.  If the argument s is non-NULL, the name is
     copied to the buffer it points to, and that address is being returned.
     This buffer must provide space for at least L_cuserid characters.  The
     L_cuserid constant is defined in <stdio.h>.

     If s is NULL, an internal array is used and its address will be returned.

RETURN VALUES
     The cuserid() function returns the address of an array in which the name
     has been stored.

     If the name associated with the effective UID of the current process
     could not be found, either a null pointer will be returned, or (if s is
     non-NULL) the buffer s will be filled with a null string.
