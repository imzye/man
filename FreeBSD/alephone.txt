ENVIRONMENT
       ALEPHONE_DATA
              Directories that are searched for data files.  This is a colon-
              separated list.  Entries later in the list have precedence over
              entries earlier in the list.

FILES
       ~/.alephone
              Aleph One personalization directory.  Alephone stores
              preferences, game recordings, saved games, and screen shots
              there.  If ALEPHONE_DATA is not set, alephone searches this
              directory for data files after searching the directory given as
              its argument.

BUGS
       If ALEPHONE_DATA is set, the directory argument is ignored.
