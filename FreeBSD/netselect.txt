NETSELECT(1)            FreeBSD General Commands Manual           NETSELECT(1)



NAME
       netselect - choose the fastest server automatically


SYNOPSIS
       netselect [-v|-vv|-vvv|-vvvv] [-m HOPS] [-s SERVERS] [-t PACKETS]
       host ...


DESCRIPTION
       netselect determines several facts about all of the hosts given on the
       command line, much faster than you would if you manually tried to use
       ping and traceroute.

       For each host, netselect figures out the approximate ping time (though
       not as accurately as ping does), the number of network "hops" to reach
       the target, and the percentage of ping requests that got through
       successfully. Then netselect calculates the "score" of each operational
       host based on these values.  A lower score is better, in the end it
       prints one line showing the server with the best score.


EXAMPLES
       # netselect -vv ftp.fceia.unr.edu.ar ftp.kulnet.kuleuven.ac.be \
                  ftp.cdrom.com ftp.debian.org ftp.de.debian.org

       This is the output:

       ftp.fceia.unr.edu.ar         2792 ms  23 hops  100% ok ( 1/ 1) [ 9213]
       ftp.kulnet.kuleuven.ac.be    9999 ms  30 hops    0% ok
       ftp.cdrom.com                  94 ms   8 hops  100% ok (10/10) [  169]
       ftp.debian.org                 46 ms  15 hops  100% ok (10/10) [  115]
       ftp.de.debian.org            9999 ms  30 hops    0% ok
         115 ftp.debian.org

       The value in brackets is the "score" of each operational host based on
       these values.  A lower score is better.  The last line shows the server
       with the best score.  If we had not used '-vv' on the command line,
       only this last line would have been printed.

       Note that for ftp.kulnet.kuleuven.ac.be and ftp.de.debian.org in this
       case, nothing got through at all.  That indicates that either the host
       doesn't exist, or it is down.


OPTIONS
       -v     Verbose mode.  Displays nameserver resolution messages to
              stderr.  You probably want this so that you don't get bored
              waiting for a hundred name resolutions to finish.


       -vv    Very verbose mode.  Displays nameserver resolution and
              statistics (not just scores) to STDERR and STDOUT.


       -vvv   Very very verbose mode.  Everything -vv prints, plus it print
              every packet received as it happens.  Good for debugging or
              trying to figure out how it works.


       -vvvv  Very very very verbose mode.  Everything -vvv prints, plus a
              trace of all packets sent.


       -m HOPS
              Maximum TTL (time to live).  Don't accept hosts that are further
              than HOPS away.


       -s SERVERS
              Print this many "top-scoring" SERVERS at the end of the list.
              If SERVERS is 0, then this disables printing of high scores.


       -t PACKETS
              Make sure at least 50% of the hosts get tested with this many
              PACKETS.  The more packets you use, the more accurate are the
              results... and the longer it takes to run.  The default is 10,
              which is usually okay.


       -I     Use ICMP instead of UDP probes. In some occassions (firewalled
              hosts) UDP probes like those used in traceroute will get
              filtered out and hosts might be perceived as dead. Using this
              option will make netselect use ICMP probes instead.
