DAV_RECONSTRUCT(1)                Cyrus IMAP                DAV_RECONSTRUCT(1)

NAME
       dav_reconstruct - Cyrus IMAP documentation

       Rebuild the caldav and carddav database for a user/set of users.

SYNOPSIS

          dav_reconstruct [ -C alt_config] [ -A <audit tool> ] [ -a ] <userid_list>

DESCRIPTION
       dav_reconstruct fixes up the dav internal sqlite database which is used
       for lots of the dav commands to make them more efficient.

       Any corruption to the dav database can cause the wrong stuff to be
       returned via caldav/carddav. Using dav_reconstruct can correct these
       faults.

OPTIONS

       -C alt_config
              Alternative config file with cyrus settings.

       -a, --all
              Process all users on this store.

       -A audit-tool, --audit-tool=audit-tool
              Name of a program to take two sqlite databases and compare them.
              This option currently does not work.

       userid_list
              List of users whose cal/card dav information you need to fix.
