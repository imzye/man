TABLE_SQLITE(5)           FreeBSD File Formats Manual          TABLE_SQLITE(5)

NAME
     table_sqlite – format description for smtpd sqlite tables

DESCRIPTION
     This manual page documents the file format of sqlite tables used by the
     smtpd(8) mail daemon.

     The format described here applies to tables as defined in smtpd.conf(5).

SQLITE TABLE
     A sqlite table allows the storing of usernames, passwords, aliases, and
     domains in a format that is shareable across various machines that
     support sqlite3(1) (SQLite version 3).

     The table is used by smtpd(8) when authenticating a user, when user
     information such as user-id and/or home directory is required for a
     delivery, when a domain lookup may be required, and/or when looking for
     an alias.

     A sqlite table consists of one or more sqlite3(1) databases with one or
     more tables.

     If the table is used for authentication, the password should be encrypted
     using the crypt(3) function.  Such passwords can be generated using the
     encrypt(1) utility or smtpctl(8) encrypt command.

SQLITE TABLE CONFIG FILE
     The following configuration options are available:

     dbpath file
             This is the path to where the DB file is located.  For example:

                   dbpath /etc/mail/smtp.sqlite

     query_alias SQL statement
             This is used to provide a query to look up aliases.  The question
             mark is replaced with the appropriate data.  For alias it is the
             left hand side of the SMTP address.  This expects one VARCHAR to
             be returned with the user name the alias resolves to.

     query_credentials SQL statement
             This is used to provide a query for looking up user credentials.
             The question mark is replaced with the appropriate data.  For
             credentials it is the left hand side of the SMTP address.  The
             query expects that there are two VARCHARS returned, one with a
             user name and one with a password in crypt(3) format.

     query_domain SQL statement
             This is used to provide a query for looking up a domain.  The
             question mark is replaced with the appropriate data.  For the
             domain it would be the right hand side of the SMTP address.  This
             expects one VARCHAR to be returned with a matching domain name.

     query_mailaddrmap SQL statement
             This is used to provide a query for looking up a senders.  The
             question mark is replaced with the appropriate data.  This
             expects one VARCHAR to be returned with the address the sender is
             allowed to send mails from.

     A generic SQL statement would be something like:

           query_ SELECT value FROM table WHERE key=?;

FILES
     /etc/mail/smtp.sqlite  Suggested sqlite3(1) database file.
     /etc/mail/sqlite.conf  Default table-sqlite(8) configuration file.

EXAMPLES
     Example based on the OpenSMTPD FAQ: Building a Mail Server The filtering
     part is excluded in this example.  The configuration below is for a
     medium-size mail server which handles multiple domains with multiple
     virtual users and is based on several assumptions.  One is that a single
     system user named vmail is used for all virtual users.  This user needs
     to be created:

           # useradd -g =uid -c "Virtual Mail" -d /var/vmail -s /sbin/nologin vmail
           # mkdir /var/vmail
           # chown vmail:vmail /var/vmail

     The sqlite schema is:

           CREATE TABLE virtuals (
               id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
               email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
               destination VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
           );
           CREATE TABLE credentials (
               id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
               email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
               password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
           );
           CREATE TABLE domains (
               id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
               domain VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
           );

     Which can be populated as follows:

           INSERT INTO domains VALUES (1, "example.com");
           INSERT INTO domains VALUES (2, "example.net");
           INSERT INTO domains VALUES (3, "example.org");

           INSERT INTO virtuals VALUES (1, "abuse@example.com", "bob@example.com");
           INSERT INTO virtuals VALUES (2, "postmaster@example.com", "bob@example.com");
           INSERT INTO virtuals VALUES (3, "webmaster@example.com", "bob@example.com");
           INSERT INTO virtuals VALUES (4, "bob@example.com", "vmail");
           INSERT INTO virtuals VALUES (5, "abuse@example.net", "alice@example.net");
           INSERT INTO virtuals VALUES (6, "postmaster@example.net", "alice@example.net");
           INSERT INTO virtuals VALUES (7, "webmaster@example.net", "alice@example.net");
           INSERT INTO virtuals VALUES (8, "alice@example.net", "vmail");

           INSERT INTO credentials VALUES (1, "bob@example.com", "$2b$08$ANGFKBL.BnDLL0bUl7I6aumTCLRJSQluSQLuueWRG.xceworWrUIu");
           INSERT INTO credentials VALUES (2, "alice@example.net", "$2b$08$AkHdB37kaj2NEoTcISHSYOCEBA5vyW1RcD8H1HG.XX0P/G1KIYwii");

     The /etc/mail/sqlite.conf file then specifies the following queries:

           dbpath /etc/mail/smtp.sqlite
           query_alias SELECT destination FROM virtuals WHERE email=?;
           query_credentials SELECT email, password FROM credentials WHERE email=?;
           query_domain SELECT domain FROM domains WHERE domain=?;

     And the following configuration for smtpd(8) in /etc/mail/smtpd.conf:

           table domains sqlite:/etc/mail/sqlite.conf
           table virtuals sqlite:/etc/mail/sqlite.conf
           table credentials sqlite:/etc/mail/sqlite.conf
           listen on egress port 25 tls pki mail.example.com
           listen on egress port 587 tls-require pki mail.example.com auth <credentials>
           accept from any for domain <domains> virtual <virtuals> deliver to mbox
