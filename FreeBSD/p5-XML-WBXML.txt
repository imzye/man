NAME
       XML::WBXML - Convert between XML and WBXML using libwbxml2

SYNOPSIS
         use XML::WBXML;

         $wbxml = XML::WBXML::xml_to_wbxml($xml);
         $xml = XML::WBXML::wbxml_to_xml($wbxml);

DESCRIPTION
       This module is a wrapper around Aymerick Jehanne's libwbxml (or perhaps
       libwbxml2, I am not sure what the distinction is) library for handling
       Wireless Binary XML.  You must install libwbxml2 prior to installing
       this module.  The library can be found at http://libwbxml.aymerick.com/
       (libwbxml2 itself requires the expat library to be installed.)

       The module defines two functions: "xml_to_wbxml" and "wbxml_to_xml".

EXPORTS
       None by default.

EXPORTABLE FUNCTIONS
   xml_to_wbxml $xml
       Given a string containing an XML document, converts it to WBXML
       (version 1.2).  Returns undef on errors.

       (As far as I can tell, the only distinction between version 1.2 and
       version 1.3 of WBXML is the first byte -- 0x03 in 1.3 and 0x02 in 1.2.)

   wbxml_to_xml $wbxml
       Given a string containing a WBXML document, converts it to XML (without
       extra whitespace).  Returns undef on errors.

DEPENDENCIES
       libwbxml2, a C compiler, and (transitively) expat.

INCOMPATIBILITIES
       None reported.
