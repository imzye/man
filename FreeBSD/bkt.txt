NAME
       bkt - Subprocess caching utility

SYNOPSIS
       bkt [OPTIONS] --ttl <DURATION> -- <COMMAND>...

DESCRIPTION
       CLI and Rust library for caching subprocess invocations

   Arguments:
       <COMMAND>...
              The command to run

OPTIONS
       --ttl <DURATION>
              Duration the cached result will be valid for [env: BKT_TTL=]
              [aliases: time-to-live]

       --stale <DURATION>
              Duration after which the result will be asynchronously refreshed

       --warm Asynchronously execute and cache the given command, even if it's
              already cached

       --force
              Execute and cache the given command, even if it's already cached

       --cwd  Includes the current working directory in the cache key, so that
              the same command run in different directories caches separately
              [aliases: use-working-dir]

       --env <NAME>
              Includes the given environment variable in the cache key, so
              that the same command run with different values for the given
              variables caches separately [aliases: use-environment]

       --modtime <FILE>
              Includes the last modification time of the given file(s) in the
              cache key, so that the same command run with different modtimes
              for the given files caches separately [aliases:
              use-file-modtime]

       --discard-failures
              Don't cache invocations that fail (non-zero exit code). USE
              CAUTION when passing this flag, as unexpected failures can lead
              to a spike in invocations which can exacerbate ongoing issues,
              effectively a DDoS

       --scope <NAME>
              If set, all cached data will be scoped to this value, preventing
              collisions with commands cached with different scopes [env:
              BKT_SCOPE=]

       --cache-dir <DIR>
              The directory under which to persist cached invocations;
              defaults to the system's temp directory. Setting this to a
              directory backed by RAM or an SSD, such as a tmpfs partition,
              will significantly reduce caching overhead [env: BKT_CACHE_DIR=]

       -h, --help
              Print help

       -V, --version
              Print version
