SIGNALD(7)         FreeBSD Miscellaneous Information Manual         SIGNALD(7)

NAME
     signald – Daemon to facilitate communication via Signal Private Messenger

SYNOPSIS
     pkg install signald

DESCRIPTION
     Signald is an unofficial utility for interacting with Signal.  It is a
     Java based daemon that is running in the background and is communicated
     to over a socket.

     This man page documents how the FreeBSD port is installed and how to get
     started.  It assumes that the signald package was already installed,
     e.g., from the FreeBSD package repo as described in SYNOPSIS.

GETTING STARTED
     To enable and start the service, run as root

           service signald enable
           service signald start

     Check log output:

           cat /var/log/signald/signald.log

     Install signaldctl, a command line tool that allows interacting with the
     service:

           pkg install go
           go install gitlab.com/signald/signald-go/cmd/signaldctl@latest

LINKING A DEVICE
     To link an existing device (phone), first enter

           ~/go/bin/signaldctl account link

     then do "Select Linked Devices -> Link New Device" in the Signal
     smartphone app's menu and scan the QR code shown on your terminal.

REGISTERING A DEVICE
     WARNING: This disconnects other devices using the same MSISDN.
     •   Open your web browser and enable developer mode
     •   Go to https://signalcaptchas.org/registration/generate.html
     •   Solve the captcha
     •   Depending on your browser you are redirected to a URL starting with
         "signalcaptcha://" or it can be seen in the web developer console -
         everything after "//" is the captcha.

     Register your device using the captcha copied above:

           ~/go/bin/signaldctl account register [msisdn] --captcha [captcha]

     msisdn is your full mobile phone number with country code, e.g.,
     +123456789.

     You will receive a text message containing a verification code on the
     MSISDN specified in the registration call above.  Use this verification
     code

           ~/go/bin/signaldctl account verify [msisdn] [code]

     to complete the registration.

SENDING A MESSAGE
     Use this command to send a message

           ~/go/bin/signaldctl message send -a [msisdn_from] [msisdn_to] [msg]

     You can also send a message to yourself when using a linked device, which
     will show up in "Note to Self", but not cause a notification, e.g.,

           ~/go/bin/signaldctl message send -a +123456789 +123456789 "Beep beep"

FILES
     /var/db/signald                Signald database.
     /var/log/signald/signald.log   Signald log output.
     /var/run/signald/signald.sock  Socket to communicate with signald, world
                                    writable.
