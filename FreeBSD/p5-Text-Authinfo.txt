NAME
       Text::Authinfo - read, query and write authinfo files

VERSION
       Version 0.01

STATUS
       This package should be considered new and untested. Please use at your
       own risk.

CAVEATS
       Users should note that authinfo files are without a formal
       specification. I have referred to resources that claim authority,
       particularly

       http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/gnus/NNTP.html

       (see "nntp-authinfo-function")

       It should be noted that this library supports a subset of files as
       described here, not arbitrary key/value pairs as hinted at in the
       description provided by gnu.org.

SYNOPSIS
         use Text::Authinfo;

         my $a = Text::Authinfo->new();
         my $read_success = $a->readauthinfo();
         print $a->as_string();
         my $pw = $a->getauth('machine.example.com','me@example.com','9999');
         my $write_success = $a->writeauthinfo();

PACKAGE VARIABLES
       $authinfofile - the full path of the authinfo file used by default,
       which points to ~/.authinfo.

OBJECT VARIABLES
       FILE - the full filename path for the authinfo file

       AUTHINFO - the nested hashrefs denoting the authinfo data. This is of
       the form:

         $a->{AUTHINFO}->{$machine}->{$port}->{$login} = $password;

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
   new
         my $a1 = Text::Authinfo->new();
         my $a2 = Text::Authinfo->new('/home/me/.otherauthinfofile');

       The constructor has an optional argument that can be used to stipulate
       an alternative authinfofile to use.

   readauthinfo
         my $read_success = $a->readauthinfo();

       Reads the authinfofile data into "$a->{AUTHINFO}". Returns 1 for
       success, 0 otherwise.

   as_string
         print $a->as_string();

   writeauthinfo
         my $write_success1 = $a1->writeauthinfo();
         my $write_success2 = $a2->writeauthinfo({'nobackup'=>1});

       Writes the contents of "$a->{AUTHINFO}" into "$a->{FILE}", while
       creating a backup file with the same path as "$a->{FILE}", but with
       '.bak' appended.

       Passing a hashref with "nobackup" set will prevent this behavior.

       Note! this function will overwrite your existing authinfo file. This
       can be dangerous! Keep backups.

       The file written will have mode 0600 applied.

   getauth
         my $pw = $a->getauth('machine.example.com','me@example.com','9999');

         my $pw = $a->getauth('machine.example.com','me@example.com');

       This function retrieves your password. The required arguments are
       determined by the contents of the line for each auth. If a port was
       mandated, you must pass that in as the third parameter as in the first
       example above. Otherwise, if the auth line in question did not contain
       a port, do not pass one in here.

       This function returns undef if no match is found.
