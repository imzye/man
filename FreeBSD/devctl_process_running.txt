DEVCTL_PROCESS_RUNNING(9)                    FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual

NAME
     devctl_process_running – Returns true when devctl has a consumer process
     running

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/devctl.h>

     bool
     devctl_process_running(void);

DESCRIPTION
     The devctl_process_running call returns true when a process has the
     devctl device open for reading, and false otherwise.  One can assume from
     this that the default devd(8) or similar is running when true is
     returned.  Some subsystems will send a message and allow userland to do
     something before proceeding with a default action if there's a timeout.
     This call allows those subsystems to do the default action right away
     when no process is running.

SEE ALSO
     devd(8)
