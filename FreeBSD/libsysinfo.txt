SYSINFO(3)             FreeBSD Library Functions Manual             SYSINFO(3)

NAME
       SYSINFO - GNU interface for gathering system information


SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/sysinfo.h>

       int sysinfo(struct sysinfo *info);


DESCRIPTION
       The sysinfo() function returns common information about the
       configuration and state of the system:

       struct sysinfo {
         long uptime;                  /* Seconds since boot */
         unsigned long loads[3];       /* 1, 5, and 15 minute load averages */
         unsigned long totalram;       /* Total usable main memory size */
         unsigned long freeram;        /* Available memory size */
         unsigned long sharedram;      /* Amount of shared memory */
         unsigned long bufferram;      /* Memory used by buffers */
         unsigned long totalswap;      /* Total swap space size */
         unsigned long freeswap;       /* swap space still available */
         unsigned short procs;         /* Number of current processes */
         unsigned short pad;           /* leaving this for linux compatibility */
         unsigned long totalhigh;      /* Total high memory size */
         unsigned long freehigh;       /* Available high memory size */
         unsigned int mem_unit;        /* Memory unit size in bytes */
         /* leaving this for linux compatibility */
         char _f[20-2*sizeof(long)-sizeof(int)];
       };

       sysinfo() is a high-level GNU interface for retrieving information
       otherwise provided by sysconf(3) and sysctl(3).


RETURNS
       0 on success, -1 if full data cannot be collected.


SEE ALSO
       sysconf(3), sysctl(3)


STANDARDS
       sysinfo() is not portable, and is provided mainly as a bridge for
       porting GNU programs.
