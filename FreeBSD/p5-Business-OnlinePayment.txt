SYNOPSIS

                               )
         my $transaction = new Business::OnlinePayment($processor, %processor_info);
         $transaction->content(
                               type       => 'Visa',
                               amount     => '49.95',
                               cardnumber => '1234123412341238',
                               expiration => '0100',
                               name       => 'John Q Doe',
                              );
         $transaction->submit();

         if($transaction->is_success()) {
           print "Card processed successfully: ".$transaction->authorization()."\n";
         } else {
           print "Card was rejected: ".$transaction->error_message()."\n";
         }

DESCRIPTION
       This is a module that adds functionality to Business::OnlinePayment.
       See Business::OnlinePayment.

       The user instantiates a Business::OnlinePayment object per usual,
       adding in three processor directives

       •   fraud_detection

           Which Fraud Detection module to use.

       •   maximum_fraud_score

           FraudDetection drivers are expected to return a numeric "risk"
           factor, this parameter allows you to set the threshold to reject
           the transaction based on that risk.  Higher numbers are "riskier"
           transactions.

       •   other driver-specific parameters.

           Consult the specific Fraud Detection module you intend to use for
           its required parameters.

       The $tx->submit() method is overridden to interpose a FraudDetection
       phase.  A subordinate object is created using the same content as the
       parent OnlinePayment object, and a Fraud Detect action is run against
       that subordinate object.  If the resulting fraud score is less than or
       equal to the maximum_risk parameter, the parent transaction will be
       allowed to proceed.  Otherwise, a failure state will exist with a
       suitable error message.

METHODS
       This module provides no new methods.  It does, however override the
       submit method to interpose an additional Fraud Detection phase.
