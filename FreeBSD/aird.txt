AIRD(1)                 FreeBSD General Commands Manual                AIRD(1)

NAME
     aird – USB Apple IR receiver daemon

SYNOPSIS
     aird [-vd] [-p pidfile] [-k key] -f device [-M menu command]
          [-P play command] [-F forward command] [-B backward command]
          [-U volume up command] [-D volume down command]

DESCRIPTION
     The aird daemon handles Apple IR receiver button events.  If your system
     has an USB Apple IR receiver, most likely you'll also have an Apple
     Remote.  An Apple remote has six (6) buttons: Volume up, Volume down,
     Play/Pause, Forward, Backward and Menu.  For each button you can assign a
     command to execute.

     Apple IR receiver modules are found on:

           •   MacBook (any generation)
           •   MacBook Pro (any generation)
           •   Intel iMac
           •   Intel MacMini

     The following program options are available:

     -v      Enable verbose mode.

     -d      Toggles the daemon flag.

     -p pidfile
             Use the specified file to store the process ID.

     -f device
             Read from the specified device entry. This is mandatory.

     -k key  Only accept commands from the remote with the specified key.  See
             the EXAMPLES section to understand how remote pairing works.

     The following options specify commands to run upon button down events:

     -M menu command
             Command to run when the daemon recieves a notification that the
             Menu button was pressed.

     -P play command
             Command to run when the daemon recieves a notification that the
             Play/Pause button was pressed.

     -F forward command
             Command to run when the daemon recieves a notification that the
             Forward button was pressed.

     -B backward command
             Command to run when the daemon recieves a notification that the
             Backward button was pressed.

     -U volume up command
             Command to run when the daemon recieves a notification that the
             Volume Up button was pressed.

     -D volume down command
             Command to run when the daemon recieves a notification that the
             Volume Down button was pressed.

     Note that lower case options are program options and upper case options
     specify the commands to run upon button down events.

FILES
     /var/run/aird.pid
             The default location of the PID file.

EXAMPLES
     To pair a remote controller with your IR receiver, do the following:

           aird -f /dev/uhid1 -k 0

     Then press the Menu and Forward keys at the same time for five seconds.
     The following will show up:

           Your Apple remote pairing key is: 131
           Next time you run aird, pass this number as the -k argument.

     This example shows how to control mpd(1) with aird(1).  You need mpc(1)
     and ncmpc(1) installed.  Run aird(1) from your ~/.xinitrc startup file
     like this:

           aird -p ~/.aird.pid -f /dev/uhid1 -P "mpc toggle" -F "mpc next" \
             -B "mpc prev" -U "mixer vol +2" -D "mixer vol -2"  \
             -M "xterm -e ncmpc"

     If you want to stop other users from gaining control of the IR receiver
     and to prevent commands to be executed when someone presses a button on
     the remote control, run aird(1) only with the -f argument:

           aird -f /dev/uhid1

     (ports/audio/ncmpc), uhid(4), usb(4)

HISTORY
     The aird utility first appeared in FreeBSD 8.0.
