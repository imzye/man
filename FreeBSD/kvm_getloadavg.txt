KVM_GETLOADAVG(3)      FreeBSD Library Functions Manual      KVM_GETLOADAVG(3)

NAME
     kvm_getloadavg – get load average of the system

LIBRARY
     Kernel Data Access Library (libkvm, -lkvm)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <kvm.h>

     int
     kvm_getloadavg(kvm_t *kd, double loadavg[], int nelem);

DESCRIPTION
     The kvm_getloadavg() function returns the number of processes in the
     system run queue of the kernel indicated by kd, averaged over various
     periods of time.  Up to nelem samples are retrieved and assigned to
     successive elements of loadavg[].  The system imposes a maximum of 3
     samples, representing averages over the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes,
     respectively.

DIAGNOSTICS
     If the load average was unobtainable, -1 is returned; otherwise, the
     number of samples actually retrieved is returned.
