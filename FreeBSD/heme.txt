NAME
       heme - console hex editor


SYNOPSIS
       heme [ -d, --disable-colors ] [ -c, --config-file CONFIGFILE ] [ -n,
       --no-backup-files ] [ -h, --help ] [ -v, --version ] file


DESCRIPTION
       heme is intended to be fast and portable console hex editor for unix
       systems. It has undo support (number of undo operations is only limited
       by available memory), ability to fill a range of addresses with the
       specified byte, ability to search for a single byte or character
       string. Offsets can be given in hexadecimal, octal or decimal.  There
       are two editing modes: hex and ascii. In hex mode you type hexadecimal
       digits and in ascii mode you type characters. In the ascii mode cursor
       is automatically moved to the next byte after typing a character (this
       behaviour is configurable for hex mode). heme uses curses library for
       screen and input handling. Colors are supported and they may be
       configured in the configuration file (see below). If the configuration
       file isn't present, heme will use defaults. You may also specify which
       configuration file to use with the -c command line option.


OPTIONS
       -n, --no-backup-files
              Don't make backup files.

       -c, --config-file CONFIGFILE
              Read configuration from CONFIGFILE. If not given, heme will try
              to read ~/.hemerc. If that fails, defaults will be used.

       -d, --disable-colors
              Don't use colors.

       -h, --help
              Show all available command line options.

       -v, --version
              Show heme version.

       Keys (all are case-insensitive, except in the ascii mode):

       left (right)
              Move to previous (next) byte

       up (down)
              Move to previous (next) line

       <      Move to beginning of line

       >      Move to end of line

       page up
              Move 1 page up

       page down
              Move 1 page down

       home   Move to beginning of file

       end    Move to end of file

       h      Display help screen

       j      Jump to offset

       n (w)  Search for byte (string)

       r      Repeat last search

       l      Fill range with byte

       tab    Toggle between hex and ascii editing modes

       u      Undo

       s      Save file

       q      Quit


CONFIGURATION
       Configuration file is expected to reside in ~/.hemerc. The syntax is
       very simple:

           # this is a comment
           option_1 = value
           option_2 = "value 2"

       Everything beyond the '#' is considered a comment and is ignored to the
       end of that line. Supported options are:

       use_colors
              Set this to 1 if you want colors, 0 otherwise (default: 1)

       advance_after_edit
              Set this to 1 if you want to advance to the next byte after
              editing byte at the current offset (default: 1)

       make_backup_files
              Set this to 1 if you want heme to make backup files, 0 otherwise
              (default: 1)

       bg_color
              Background color (default: "blue")

       fg_color
              Foreground color (default: "white")

       bg_color_selected
              Background color of selected byte (default: "black")

       fg_color_selected
              Foreground color of selected byte (default: "green")

       bg_color_status
              Background color of status lines (default: "cyan")

       fg_color_status
              Foreground color of status lines (default: "black")

       Color names are "black", "red", "green", "yellow", "blue", "magenta",
       "cyan" and "white".

       bg_color = black
       fg_color = white
       bg_color_selected = green
       fg_color_selected = yellow
