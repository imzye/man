DESCRIPTION
       This module implements a simple approach to creating modules and their
       support files, based on the Module::Starter approach. Module::Starter
       needs to be installed before this module can be used.

       When used as a Module::Starter plugin, this module allows you to
       specify a simple directory of templates which are filled in with
       module-specific information, and thereafter form the basis of your new
       module.

       The default templates that this module initially provides are based on
       the recommendations in the book "Perl Best Practices".

INTERFACE
       Thsi module simply acts as a plugin for Module::Starter. So it uses the
       same command-line interface as that module.

       The template files it is to use are specified in your Module::Starter
       "config" file, by adding a "template_dir" configuration variable that
       gives the full path name of the directory in which you want to put the
       templates.

       The easiest way to set up this "config" file, the associated directory,
       and the necessary template files is to type:

           > perl -MModule::Starter::PBP=setup

       on the command line. You will then be asked for your name, email
       address, and the full path name of the directory where you want to keep
       the templates, after which they will be created and installed.

       Then you can create a new module by typing:

           > module-starter --module=Your::New::Module

   Template format
       The templates are plain files named:

               Build.PL
               Makefile.PL
               README
               Changes
               Module.pm
               t/whatever_you_like.t

       The "Module.pm" file is the template for the ".pm" file for your
       module. Any files in the "t/" subdirectory become the templates for the
       testing files of your module. All the remaining files are templates for
       the ditribution files of the same names.

       In those files, the following placeholders are replaced by the
       appropriate information specific to the file:

       <AUTHOR>
           The nominated author. Taken from the "author" setting in your
           Module::Starter "config" file.

       <BUILD INSTRUCTIONS>
           Makefile or Module::Build instructions. Computed automatically
           according to the "builder" setting in your Module::Starter "config"
           file.

       <DATE>
           The current date (as returned by "localtime"). Computed
           automagically

       <DISTRO>
           The name of the complete module distribution. Computed
           automatically from the name of the module.

       <EMAIL>
           Where to send feedback. Taken from the "email" setting in your
           Module::Starter "config" file.

       <LICENSE>
           The licence under which the module is released. Taken from the
           "license" setting in your Module::Starter "config" file.

       <MAIN MODULE>
           The name of the main module of the distribution.

       <MAIN PM FILE>
           The name of the ".pm" file for the main module.

       <MODULE NAME>
           The name of the current module being created within the
           distribution.

       <RT NAME>
           The name to use for bug reports to the RT system.  That is:

               Please report any bugs or feature requests to
               bug-<RT NAME>@rt.cpan.org>

       <YEAR>
           The current year. Computed automatically

DIAGNOSTICS
       "Can't find directory that holds Module::Starter::PBP templates"
           You did not tell Module::Starter::PBP where your templates are
           stored.  You need a 'template_dir' specification. Typically this
           would go in your ~/.module-starter/config file. Something like:

               template_dir: /users/you/.module-starter/Templates

       "Can't access Module::Starter::PBP template directory"
           You specified a 'template_dir', but the path didn't lead to a
           readable directory.

       "The template: %s isn't in the template directory (%s)"
           One of the required templates:

           was missing from the template directory you specified.

       "The template: %s isn't readable in the template directory (%s)"
           One of the templates in the template directory you specified was
           not readable.

       "Unknown placeholder <%s> in %s"
           One of the templates in the template directory contained a
           replacement item that wasn't a known piece of information.
