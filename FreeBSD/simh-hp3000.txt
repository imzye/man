NAME
     hp3000 – Simulator for HP 3000 series computers

SYNOPSIS
     hp3000 [-e] [-q] [-v] [startup-file [arguments]]

DESCRIPTION
     hp3000 is a simulator for the classic SIO machines. This group consists
     of the 3000 CX, the Series I, Series II, and the HP 3000 Series III that
     is simulated here. A large variety of CPU options, device interface
     cards, and peripherals are provided.

     The following options are available:

     -e      Processing of startup-file (including nested command invocations)
             is aborted if a command error is encountered.

     -q      Certain informational messages are suppressed.

     -v      The commands in startup-file are echoed before they are executed.

     If startup-file is specified, it is used as an initial source of
     simulator commands.  If startup-file is not specified, default locations
     are searched. See the SIMH User's Supplement for more details.

     If a startup file is specified, either on the command line or otherwise,
     it should contain a series of non-interactive simulator commands, one per
     line.  These commands can be used to set up standard parameters.

     After initializing its internal structures and processing the startup
     file (if any), the simulator types out its name and version and then
     prompts for input with:

           sim>

EXIT STATUS
     hp3000 exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
