DWARF_LNE_END_SEQUENCE(3)                     FreeBSD Library Functions Manual

NAME
     dwarf_lne_end_sequence – set the end of instruction sequence

LIBRARY
     DWARF Access Library (libdwarf, -ldwarf)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <libdwarf.h>

     Dwarf_Unsigned
     dwarf_lne_end_sequence(Dwarf_P_Debug dbg, Dwarf_Addr addr,
         Dwarf_Error *err);

DESCRIPTION
     Function dwarf_lne_end_sequence() sets the address that indicates the end
     of a sequence of target machine instructions.

     Argument dbg should reference a DWARF producer instance allocated using
     dwarf_producer_init(3) or dwarf_producer_init_b(3).

     Argument addr specifies an address value which is the first byte after
     the end of a instruction sequence.

     If argument err is not NULL, it will be used to store error information
     in case of an error.

RETURN VALUES
     On success, function dwarf_lne_end_sequence() returns DW_DLV_OK.  In case
     of an error, function dwarf_lne_end_sequence() returns DW_DLV_NOCOUNT and
     sets the argument err.

ERRORS
     Function dwarf_lne_end_sequence() can fail with:

     [DW_DLE_ARGUMENT]       Argument dbg was NULL.

     [DW_DLE_ARGUMENT]       The value in argument addr overlapped an existing
                             line information entry.

     [DW_DLE_MEMORY]         An out of memory condition was encountered during
                             the execution of the function.
