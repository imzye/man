NAME
       Ampache - is a Web-based Audio file manager.

DESCRIPTION
       Ampache is implemented with MySQL, and PHP. It allows you to view,
       edit, and play your audio files via the web. It has support for
       playlists, artist and album views, album art, random play, playback via
       HTTP, on the Fly Transcoding and Downsampling, Vote based playback, Mpd
       and Icecast, Integrated Flash Player, as well as per user themes and
       song play tracking. You can also Link multiple Ampache servers together
       using XML-RPC. Ampache supports GETTEXT translations and has a full
       translation of many languages.


OPTIONS
       The following scripts are included in Ampache and can be used to
       automate some aspects of Ampache.

       catalog_update.inc

       You can automate the update of all, or some of your local catalogs by
       using the bin/catalog_update.inc file. By default this will run a
       clean, verify and update on all of your local catalogs.  You can
       optionally specify the name of the catalog and it will only update the
       specified catalog.  Very useful when used with cron or crontab.

       dump_art.inc

       You can output all of the album art stored in ampache to the
       filesystem. It will output the image stored in the database to the
       directory of the first file in the album. This can cause problems f
       your files are not in their own directories. You can specify the
       filename to be written by modifying the config file options relating to
       album_art_preferred_filename. Ampache will by default output meta data
       directory files for linux.

       delete_disabled.inc

       If you would like to delete all of the disabled songs in Ampache you
       can run the bin/delete_disabled.inc to delete all of the songs that are
       disabled in Ampache.  Naturally this requires the user you run the
       script as to have permissions to delete the files in question. By
       default this script will not work if you run it. You must open it and
       delete or comment out the line that says $debug=true for it to actually
       work.

       sort_files.inc

       You can have Ampache automatically rename and move all of your files
       based on the meta data in Ampache using the bin/sort_files.inc script.
       This requires write access to the files in question. The files will be
       renamed and moved based on their respective File and Folder patterns as
       defined by the catalog.  Ampache will also by default sort your files
       into A-Z sub-folders to reduce the number of folders at the top level.
       You can turn this off by editing the file and setting the
       $alphabet_prefix to false, or commenting it out.

       fix_filenames.inc

       Ampache provides some additional tools to help you cope with Character
       set mis-matches. These scripts must be run from the command line. After
       making any changes to your tags or the filenames please make sure you
       update your catalog and that your local client has the character set
       and fonts required to display the tag information.  This script looks
       through the path of your local catalogs for filenames who contain
       characters that do not exist in the currently configured site_charset.
       It will prompt you for a source character charset, if none is specified
       it will use the current output_encoding value from iconv().

       print_tags.inc

       You can also look at the raw tags inside a file by running the included
       print_tags.inc file. This example takes advantage of the hexcat
       application to get the hex values of the output. You will need to
       compare the reported HEX value to the HEX value according to the
       defined charset.

       php /bin/print_tags.inc [FILE]

       php /usr/share/ampache/www/bin/update_catalog.inc
