URE(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 URE(4)

NAME
     ure – RealTek RTL8152/RTL8153 USB to Ethernet controller driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device uhci
           device ohci
           device usb
           device miibus
           device uether
           device ure

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_ure_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The ure driver provides support for USB Ethernet adapters based on the
     RealTek RealTek RTL8152 and RTL8153 USB Ethernet controllers.

     NICs based on the RTL8152 are capable of 10 and 100Mbps speeds.  NICs
     based on the RTL8153 are capable of 10, 100 and 1000Mbps operation.

     The ure driver supports the following media types:

     autoselect       Enable auto selection of the media type and options.
                      The user can manually override the auto selected mode by
                      adding media options to the /etc/rc.conf file.

     10baseT/UTP      Set 10Mbps operation.  The mediaopt option can also be
                      used to select either full-duplex or half-duplex modes.

     100baseTX        Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.  The mediaopt
                      option can also be used to select either full-duplex or
                      half-duplex modes.

     1000baseTX       Set 1000baseTX operation over twisted pair.  The RealTek
                      gigE chips support 1000Mbps in full-duplex mode only.

     The ure driver supports the following media options:

     full-duplex      Force full duplex operation.

     half-duplex      Force half duplex operation.

     For more information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

DIAGNOSTICS
     ure%d: watchdog timeout  A packet was queued for transmission and a
     transmit command was issued, however the device failed to acknowledge the
     transmission before a timeout expired.
