HTPASSWD(1)             FreeBSD General Commands Manual            HTPASSWD(1)

NAME
     htpasswd – create and update user authentication files

SYNOPSIS
     htpasswd [file] login
     htpasswd -I [file]

DESCRIPTION
     htpasswd is used to create and update user authentication files for HTTP
     daemons.

     The options are as follows:

     -I      Switch to batch mode.  htpasswd reads exactly one line from
             standard input and splits it at the first ":".  The first part is
             the login, the second part is the password which htpasswd then
             hashes using bcrypt(3).

     htpasswd prompts for a password and generates a hash using bcrypt(3).  A
     line suitable for a password file is written to the standard output.  If
     invoked with two arguments (or one argument if the -I flag is used), user
     authentication file is updated.

SEE ALSO
     bcrypt(3)

HISTORY
     This reimplemented version of htpasswd has been available since
     OpenBSD 5.6.

AUTHORS
     Florian Obser <florian@openbsd.org> implemented htpasswd from scratch
     after Apache httpd was removed from OpenBSD base.
