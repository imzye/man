GIFDIFF(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             GIFDIFF(1)

NAME
       gifdiff - compares GIF images

SYNOPSIS
       gifdiff [options] GIF-file-1 GIF-file-2

DESCRIPTION
       gifdiff compares two GIF files and determines if they appear identical.
       Differences that don't affect appearance (like colormap ordering or how
       much an animation is optimized) are not reported.

       gifdiff prints details of any differences it finds. If the GIFs are the
       same, it prints nothing. It exits with status 0 if there were no
       differences, 1 if there were some differences, and 2 if there was
       trouble.

OPTIONS
       --brief, -q
            Report only whether the GIFs differ, not the details of the
            differences.

       --ignore-redundancy, -w
            Do not report differences in the numbers of redundant frames
            (frames which do not change the displayed image).

       --ignore-background, -B
            Do not report differences in background colors.

       --help
            Print usage information and exit.

       --version
            Print the version number and some quickie warranty information and
            exit.
