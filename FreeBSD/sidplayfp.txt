NAME
       sidplayfp - a C64 and SID chip emulator for playing Commodore 64 music.

SYNOPSIS
       sidplayfp [OPTIONS] datafile

DESCRIPTION
       Sidplayfp is a music player that emulates various components from a
       Commodore 64 (C64) computer.  The result is a program which can load
       and execute C64 machine code programs which produce music and sound.
       Sidplayfp has been designed for accuracy which results in a quite high
       CPU usage.  Additional playback modes have, however, been provided to
       allow playback on low-spec machines at the cost of said accuracy.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           Display help.

       -h, --help-debug
           Display additional options helpful for debugging.

       -fo<num>
           Set fade-out time in seconds (default: 0).  The fade-out starts at
           the song end so this adds the specified number of seconds to the
           tune length.

       -f<num>
           Set audio output frequency in Hz (default: 48000).

       -nf No filter emulation.  This will reduce CPU overhead at the cost of
           reduced emulation quality.

       -s  Stereo playback.  If the tune is identified as stereo then sid 1
           and 2 become the left and right channels respectively.  For three
           sid tunes the chips are mixed as left, center and right.

       -m  Mono playback.

       -v|q[level]
           Verbose or quiet (no time display) console output while playing.
           Can include an optional level, defaults to 1.

       -b<num>
           Set start time in [mins:]secs[.milli] format (compatible with
           sid2wav).

       -ds<addr>
           Force dual sid environment by adding a second chip at specified
           address.  This forces emulation of 2 sid-chips for stereo playback
           even if datafile is identified as only being mono.  This occurs in
           the case of the stereo prg format as currently there is no way to
           identify them.  Stereo MUS and SID files are however automatically
           detected.  The second sid may be installed in the 0xD420-0xD7FF or
           0xDE00-0xDFFF address range.  Address may  be specified in
           exadecimal (e.g -ds0xd420) or decimal (e.g.  -ds54304) format.

       -ts<addr>
           Add a third chip at specified address.  The sid may be installed in
           the 0xD420-0xD7FF or 0xDE00-0xDFFF address range.  Address may  be
           specified in exadecimal (e.g -ts0xd440) or decimal (e.g.  -ts54336)
           format.

       -u<num>
           Mute a channel.  May be used more than one time.  Channel 1 to 3
           are for the first SID chip while channels from 4 to 6 are for the
           second one and 7 to 9 for the third.

       -g<num>
           Mute samples.  May be used more than one time, 1 for the first SID,
           2 for the second one and 3 for the third.

       -p<num>
           Set bit precision for file saving. The default is 16 to create 16
           bit signed samples, but can be set to 32 (32 bit float). Other
           values will cause invalid output.

       -o<num>
           Select start track number (default: preset).

       -o<l|s> [num]
           Option 'l' will select continuous track looping while 's' will play
           only the current track ignoring the others.  The options can be
           combined and may include the track selection.  The following
           variations are possible: -ol<num>: will loop selected track
           allowing moving to another one; -os<num>: will play selected track
           and then stop; -ols<num>: will loop selected track;

       -t<num>
           Set play length in [mins:]secs[.milli] format (0 is endless).

       -v<n|p>[f]
           Set VIC clock speed.  'n' is NTSC (America, 60Hz) and 'p' is PAL
           (Europe, 50Hz).  Providing an 'f' will prevent speed fixing that
           tries to compensate automatically for the speed difference.
           Removing speed fixing simulates what happens on a real C64.
           Options can be written as: -vnf or -vn -vf.

       -m<o|n>[f]
           Set SID chip model.  'o' is the old 6581 and 'n' is the new 8580.
           Providing an 'f' will force the selected model overriding the one
           specified by the tune.

       --digiboost
           Enable digiboost hack for 8580 model so the digi samples become
           audible.

       -r<i|r>[f]
           Set resampling mode.  'i' is interpolation (less expensive) and 'r'
           resampling (accurate).  Providing an 'f' will provide faster
           resampling sacrificing quality.  Fast resampling is available only
           for reSID emulation.  Options can be written as: -rif or -ri -rf.

       -w, --wav[name]
           Create WAV-file.  The default output filename is <datafile>[n].wav
           where [n] is the tune number should there be more than one in the
           sid.  This allows batch conversion of sid tunes without them
           overwriting each other.  By providing a name it is possible to
           override this default behavior.  The output file will be <name>
           with no tune number added and the extension .wav appended if no
           extension is given.

       --au[name]
           Create AU-file.  The default output filename is <datafile>[n].au.
           Same notes as the wav file applies.

       --resid
           Use VICE's original reSID emulation engine.

       --residfp
           Use reSIDfp emulation engine.

       --hardsid
           Use HardSID device.

       --exsid
           Use exSID device.

       --cpu-debug
           Display CPU register and assembly dumps, available only for debug
           builds.

       --delay=[num]
           Simulate C64 power on delay as number of CPU cycles.  If greater
           than 8191 the delay will be random.  This is the default.

       --fcurve=<num>|auto
           Controls the filter curve in the ReSIDfp emulation.  Ranges from
           0.0 (light) to 1.0 (dark), the default value is 0.5.  If set to
           auto it will choose a predefined value for 6581 depending on the
           tune author.

       --frange=<num>|auto
           If available controls the filter range for the 6581 in the ReSIDfp
           emulation.  Ranges from 0.0 (light) to 1.0 (dark), the default
           value is 0.5.  If set to auto it will choose a predefined value for
           6581 depending on the tune author.

       -cw<w|a|s>
           Set the strength (width) of combined waveforms.  'w' for weak
           (thin) waves, 'a' for average waves, and 's' for strong (wide)
           waves.

       --noaudio
           Run without an audio output device.

       --nosid
           Run without sid emulation.

       --none
           Run with no audio output device and no sid emulation.
