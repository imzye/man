MDBX_CHK(1)             FreeBSD General Commands Manual            MDBX_CHK(1)

NAME
       mdbx_chk - MDBX checking tool

SYNOPSIS
       mdbx_chk [-V] [-v[v[v]]] [-n] [-q] [-c] [-w] [-d] [-i] [-s_table]
        dbpath

DESCRIPTION
       The mdbx_chk utility is intended to check an MDBX database file.

OPTIONS
       -V     Write the library version number to the standard output, and
              exit.

       -v     Produce verbose output, including summarize space and page usage
              statistics.  If -vv is given, be more verbose, show summarized
              B-tree info and space allocation.  If -vvv is given, be more
              verbose, include summarized statistics of leaf B-tree pages.  If
              -vvvv is given, be even more verbose, show info of each page
              during B-tree traversal and basic info of each GC record.  If
              -vvvvv is given, turn maximal verbosity, display the full list
              of page IDs in the GC records and size of each key-value pair of
              database(s).

       -q     Be quiet; do not output anything even if an error was detected.

       -c     Force using cooperative mode while opening environment, i.e.
              don't try to open in exclusive/monopolistic mode. Only
              exclusive/monopolistic mode allow complete check, including full
              check of all meta-pages and actual size of database file.

       -w     Open environment in read-write mode and lock for writing while
              checking.  This could be impossible if environment already used
              by another process(s) in an incompatible read-write mode. This
              allows rollback to last steady commit (in case environment was
              not closed properly) and then check transaction IDs of meta-
              pages. Otherwise, without -w option environment will be opened
              in read-only mode.

       -d     Disable page-by-page traversal of B-tree. In this case, without
              B-tree traversal, it is unable to check for lost-unused pages
              nor for double-used pages.

       -i     Ignore wrong order errors, which will likely false-positive if
              custom comparator(s) was used.

       -s table
              Verify and show info only for a specific table.

       -0|-1|-2
              Using specific meta-page 0, or 2 for checking.

       -t     Turn to a specified meta-page on successful check.

       -T     Turn to a specified meta-page EVEN ON UNSUCCESSFUL CHECK!

       -u     Warms up the DB before checking via notifying OS kernel of
              subsequent access to the database pages.

       -U     Warms up the DB before checking, notifying the OS kernel of
              subsequent access to the database pages, then forcibly loads
              ones by sequential access and tries to lock database pages in
              memory.

       -n     Open MDBX environment(s) which do not use subdirectories.  This
              is a legacy option. For now MDBX handles this automatically.


DIAGNOSTICS
       Exit status is zero if no errors occur. Errors result in a non-zero
       exit status and a diagnostic message being written to standard error if
       no quiet mode was requested.
