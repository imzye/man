Directory::Scratch(3)                      User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Directory::Scratch - (DEPRECATED) Easy-to-use self-cleaning scratch
       space

VERSION
       version 0.18

DEPRECATION NOTICE
       This module has not been maintained in quite some time, and now there
       are other options available, which are much more actively maintained.
       Please use Test::TempDir::Tiny instead of this module.

SYNOPSIS
       When writing test suites for modules that operate on files, it's often
       inconvenient to correctly create a platform-independent temporary
       storage space, manipulate files inside it, then clean it up when the
       test exits.  The inconvenience usually results in tests that don't work
       everywhere, or worse, no tests at all.

       This module aims to eliminate that problem by making it easy to do
       things right.

       Example:

           use Directory::Scratch;

           my $temp = Directory::Scratch->new();
           my $dir  = $temp->mkdir('foo/bar');
           my @lines= qw(This is a file with lots of lines);
           my $file = $temp->touch('foo/bar/baz', @lines);

           my $fh = openfile($file);
           print {$fh} "Here is another line.\n";
           close $fh;

           $temp->delete('foo/bar/baz');

           undef $temp; # everything else is removed

           # Directory::Scratch objects stringify to base
           $temp->touch('foo');
           ok(-e "$temp/foo");  # /tmp/xYz837/foo should exist

EXPORT
       The first argument to the module is optional, but if specified, it's
       interpreted as the name of the OS whose file naming semantics you want
       to use with Directory::Scratch.  For example, if you choose "Unix",
       then you can provide paths to Directory::Scratch in UNIX-form
       ('foo/bar/baz') on any platform.  Unix is the default if you don't
       choose anything explicitly.

       If you want to use the local platform's flavor (not recommended),
       specify an empty import list:

           use Directory::Scratch ''; # use local path flavor

       Recognized platforms (from File::Spec):

       Mac
       UNIX
       Win32
       VMS
       OS2

       The names are case sensitive, since they simply specify which
       "File::Spec::" module to use when splitting the path.

   EXAMPLE
           use Directory::Scratch 'Win32';
           my $tmp = Directory::Scratch->new();
           $tmp->touch("foo\\bar\\baz"); # and so on

METHODS
       The file arguments to these methods are always relative to the
       temporary directory.  If you specify touch('/etc/passwd'), then a file
       called "/tmp/whatever/etc/passwd" will be created instead.

       This means that the program's PWD is ignored (for these methods), and
       that a leading "/" on the filename is meaningless (and will cause
       portability problems).

       Finally, whenever a filename or path is returned, it is a Path::Class
       object rather than a string containing the filename.  Usually, this
       object will act just like the string, but to be extra-safe, call
       "$path->stringify" to ensure that you're really getting a string.
       (Some clever modules try to determine whether a variable is a filename
       or a filehandle; these modules usually guess wrong when confronted with
       a "Path::Class" object.)

   new
       Creates a new temporary directory (via File::Temp and its defaults).
       When the object returned by this method goes out of scope, the
       directory and its contents are removed.

           my $temp = Directory::Scratch->new;
           my $another = $temp->new(); # will be under $temp

           # some File::Temp arguments get passed through (may be less portable)
           my $temp = Directory::Scratch->new(
               DIR      => '/var/tmp',       # be specific about where your files go
               CLEANUP  => 0,                # turn off automatic cleanup
               TEMPLATE => 'ScratchDirXXXX', # specify a template for the dirname
           );

       If "DIR", "CLEANUP", or "TEMPLATE" are omitted, reasonable defaults are
       selected.  "CLEANUP" is on by default, and "DIR" is set to
       "File::Spec->tmpdir";

   child
       Creates a new "Directory::Scratch" directory inside the current "base",
       copying TEMPLATE and CLEANUP options from the current instance.
       Returns a "Directory::Scratch" object.

   base
       Returns the full path of the temporary directory, as a Path::Class
       object.

   platform([$platform])
       Returns the name of the platform that the filenames are being
       interpreted as (i.e., "Win32" means that this module expects paths like
       "\foo\bar", whereas "UNIX" means it expects "/foo/bar").

       If $platform is sepcified, the platform is changed to the passed value.
       (Overrides the platform specified at module "use" time, for this
       instance only, not every "Directory::Scratch" object.)

   touch($filename, [@lines])
       Creates a file named $filename, optionally containing the elements of
       @lines separated by the output record separator "$\".

       The Path::Class object representing the new file is returned if the
       operation is successful, an exception is thrown otherwise.

   create_tree(\%tree)
       Creates a file for every key/value pair if the hash, using the key as
       the filename and the value as the contents.  If the value is an
       arrayref, the array is used as the optional @lines argument to "touch".
       If the value is a reference to "undef", then a directory is created
       instead of a file.

       Example:

           %tree = ( 'foo'     => 'this is foo',
                     'bar/baz' => 'this is baz inside bar',
                     'lines'   => [qw|this file contains 5 lines|],
                     'dir'     => \undef,
                   );
           $tmp->create_tree(\%tree);

       In this case, two directories are created, "dir" and "bar"; and three
       files are created, "foo", "baz" (inside "bar"), and "lines". "foo" and
       "baz" contain a single line, while "lines" contains 5 lines.

   openfile($filename)
       Opens $filename for writing and reading ("+>"), and returns the
       filehandle.  If $filename already exists, it will be truncated.  It's
       up to you to take care of flushing/closing.

       In list context, returns both the filehandle and the filename "($fh,
       $path)".

   mkdir($directory)
       Creates a directory (and its parents, if necessary) inside the
       temporary directory and returns its name.  Any leading "/" on the
       directory name is ignored; all directories are created inside the
       "base".

       The full path of this directory is returned if the operation is
       successful, otherwise an exception is thrown.

   tempfile([$path])
       Returns an empty filehandle + filename in $path.  If $path is omitted,
       the base directory is assumed.

       See File::Temp::tempfile.

           my($fh,$name) = $scratch->tempfile;

   exists($file)
       Returns the file's real (system) path if $file exists, undefined
       otherwise.

       Example:

           my $path = $tmp->exists($file);
           if(defined $path){
              say "Looks like you have a file at $path!";
              open(my $fh, '>>', $path) or die $!;
              print {$fh} "add another line\n";
              close $fh or die $!;
           }
           else {
              say "No file called $file."
           }

   stat($file)
       Stats $file.  In list context, returns the list returned by the "stat"
       builtin.  In scalar context, returns a "File::stat" object.

   read($file)
       Returns the contents of $file.  In array context, returns a list of
       chompped lines.  In scalar context, returns the raw octets of the file
       (with any trailing newline removed).

       If you wrote the file with $, set, you'll want to set $/ to $, when
       reading the file back in:

           local $, = '!';
           $tmp->touch('foo', qw{foo bar baz}); # writes "foo!bar!baz!" to disk
           scalar $tmp->read('foo') # returns "foo!bar!baz!"
           $tmp->read('foo') # returns ("foo!bar!baz!")
           local $/ = '!';
           $tmp->read('foo') # returns ("foo", "bar", "baz")

   write($file, @lines)
       Replaces the contents of file with @lines.  Each line will be ended
       with a "\n", or $, if it is defined.  The file will be created if
       necessary.

   append($file, @lines)
       Appends @lines to $file, as per "write".

   randfile()
       Generates a file with random string data in it.   If String::Random is
       available, it will be used to generate the file's data.  Takes 0, 1, or
       2 arguments - default size, max size, or size range.

       A max size of 0 will cause an exception to be thrown.

       Examples:

           my $file = $temp->randfile(); # size is between 1024 and 131072
           my $file = $temp->randfile( 4192 ); # size is below 4129
           my $file = $temp->randfile( 1000000, 4000000 );

   link($from, $to)
       Symlinks a file in the temporary directory to another file in the
       temporary directory.

       Note: symlinks are not supported on Win32.  Portable code must not use
       this method.  (The method will "croak" if it won't work.)

   ls([$path])
       Returns a list (in no particular order) of all files below $path.  If
       $path is omitted, the root is assumed.  Note that directories are not
       returned.

       If $path does not exist, an exception is thrown.

   delete($path)
       Deletes the named file or directory at $path.

       If the path is removed successfully, the method returns true.
       Otherwise, an exception is thrown.

       (Note: delete means "unlink" for a file and "rmdir" for a directory.
       "delete"-ing an unempty directory is an error.)

   chmod($octal_permissions, @files)
       Sets the permissions $octal_permissions on @files, returning the number
       of files successfully changed. Note that '0644' is "--w----r-T", not
       "-rw-r--r--".  You need to pass in oct('0644') or a literal 0644 for
       this method to DWIM.  The method is just a passthru to perl's built-in
       "chmod" function, so see "perldoc -f chmod" for full details.

   cleanup
       Forces an immediate cleanup of the current object's directory.  See
       File::Path's rmtree().  It is not safe to use the object after this
       method is called.

ENVIRONMENT
       If the "PERL_DIRECTORYSCRATCH_CLEANUP" variable is set to 0, automatic
       cleanup will be suppressed.
