HTML::WikiConverter::Oddmuse(3)            User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       HTML::WikiConverter::Oddmuse - Convert HTML to Oddmuse markup

SYNOPSIS
         use HTML::WikiConverter;
         my $wc = new HTML::WikiConverter( dialect => 'Oddmuse' );
         print $wc->html2wiki( $html );

DESCRIPTION
       This module contains rules for converting HTML into Oddmuse markup.
       This dialect module supports most of Oddmuse's text formatting rules
       described at [1], notably:

         * bold, strong, italic, emphasized, and underlined text
         * paragraph blocks
         * external images
         * internal and external links
         * unordered and ordered lists
         * tables [2]

        [2] http://www.oddmuse.org/cgi-bin/wiki/Table_Markup_Extension

       See HTML::WikiConverter for usage details.

ATTRIBUTES
       In addition to the regular set of attributes recognized by the
       HTML::WikiConverter constructor, this dialect also accepts the
       following attributes:

   camel_case
       Boolean indicating whether CamelCase links are enabled in the target
       Oddmuse installation. This corresponds to Oddmuse's $WikiLinks
       configuration parameter. Enabling CamelCase links will turn HTML like
       this:

         <p><a href="/wiki/CamelCase">CamelCase</a> links are fun.</p>

       into this Oddmuse markup:

         CamelCase links are fun.

       Disabling CamelCase links (the default) would convert that HTML into

         [[CamelCase]] links are fun.
