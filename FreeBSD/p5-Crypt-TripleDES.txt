NAME
       Crypt::TripleDES - Triple DES encyption.

SYNOPSIS
        my $des = new Crypt::TripleDES;
        my $cyphertext = $des->encrypt3 ( $plaintext, $passphrase );
        my $plaintext = $des->decrypt3 ( $cyphertext, $passphrase );

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements 3DES encryption in ECB mode. The code is based
       on Eric Young's implementation of DES in pure perl. It's quite slow
       because of the way Perl handles bit operations and is not recommended
       for use with large texts.

METHODS
       new The constructor.

       encrypt3 $plaintext, $passphrase
           Encrypts the plaintext string using the passphrase. Whitespace
           characters are appended to the string if its length is not a
           multiple of eight. User applications can correct for this by
           storing plaintext size with the cyphertext. The passphrase is an
           ASCII character string of upto 48 characters.

       decrypt3 $cyphertext, $passphrase
           Inverse of encrypt3().
