NAME
       Text::Xslate::Bridge::TT2Like - TT2 Variable Method Clone For
       Text::Xslate

SYNOPSIS
           use Text::Xslate;

           my $xslate = Text::Xslate->new(
               module => [
                   'Text::Xslate::Bridge::TT2Like'
               ],
           );

           # Note that all methods require a set of parenthesis to be
           # recognized as a method.
           $xslate->render_string(
               '<: $foo.length() :>',
               { foo => "foo" }
           );

           $xslate->render_string(
               '<: $foo.replace("foo", "bar") :>',
               { foo => "foo" }
           );

DESCRIPTION
       Text::Xslate::Bridge::TT2Like exports Template-Toolkit variable methods
       into Text::Xslate namespace, such that you can use them on your
       variables.

       The only difference between this module and Text::Xslate::Bridge::TT2
       is that Bridge::TT2 uses Template::Toolkit underneath, while this
       module is independent of Template::Toolkit and therefore does not
       require TT to be installed
