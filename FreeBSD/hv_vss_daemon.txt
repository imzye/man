NAME
     hv_vss_daemon – Hyper-V Volume Shadow Copy Service Daemon

SYNOPSIS
     hv_vss_daemon [-dn]

DESCRIPTION
     The hv_vss_daemon daemon provides the ability to freeze and thaw the file
     system for FreeBSD guest partitions running on Hyper-V.

     Hyper-V allows administrators to backup or restore the FreeBSD guest
     partition.  Administrators can use Windows Powershell scripts to backup
     or restore the FreeBSD VM.

     The hv_vss_daemon accepts file system freeze and thaw requests from the
     hv_utils(4) driver and performs the actual file-system operation.

     The file system freeze and thaw functionality is useful when the Hyper-V
     host wants to do live backup of FreeBSD guest. Hyper-V host sends file
     system freezing request to hv_vss_daemon which conducts the real
     operation. After successfully freezing file system, Hyper-V host takes a
     snapshot of the VM. In the future, Hyper-V host can restore the FreeBSD
     VM through that snapshot.

     The options are as follows:

     -d      Run as regular process instead of a daemon for debugging purpose.

     -n      Generate debugging output.
