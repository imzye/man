CHECKVMS(1)             FreeBSD General Commands Manual            CHECKVMS(1)

NAME
     checkvms – sanity check registered Java VMs

SYNOPSIS
     checkvms

DESCRIPTION
     Each registered Java VM is checked to ensure that it exists and that all
     appropriate symbolic links for it have been created.  Non-existent Java
     VMs are unregistered and missing symbolic links are created.  The Java
     VMs are also sorted using a hard-coded ordering that will sort them by
     version and affinity with FreeBSD.

FILES
     /usr/local/etc/javavms
             The location of the Java VM wrapper configuration file.

SEE ALSO
     javavm(1), registervm(1), unregistervm(1), javavms(5)

BUGS
     The checkvms utility removes both blank lines and purely comment lines
     from the Java VM wrapper configuration file.
