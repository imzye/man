E2CP(1)                          User commands                         E2CP(1)

NAME
       e2cp - copies files from/to an e2fs filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       e2cp [options] files... dest

DESCRIPTION
       The e2cp command copies files to/from an e2fs filesystem from/to the
       machine's filesystem.

OPTIONS
       A single `-' (dash) can be used instead of a file name to indicate
       standard input/output.

       -0     Input lines terminated by a null character.

       -a     Absolute directory names - create directories instead of just
              copying into the destination. Only valid for copying into an
              ext2fs filesystem.

       -d dest_dir
              Destination of files to be copied. May be in the ext2fs
              filesystem or the host filesystem.

       -G gid Set the default group to gid.

       -O uid Set the default file owner to uid.

       -p     Preserve host file attributes (permissions, times, etc.) when
              copying files.

       -P mode
              Set the file permissions (ie 755, 666).

       -s src_dir
              The source of the files to be copied.

       -v     Be verbose.

EXAMPLES
       Copy a file and use the default permission and ownership of the current
       user:

           e2cp README.txt /tmp/boot.img:/tmp

       Do the same thing, but keep permissions & ownership:

           e2cp -p README.txt /tmp/boot.img:/tmp

       Dump a file to standard out:

           e2cp /tmp/boot.img:/tmp/README.txt - | wc

       Get a file from standard input and put it on an unmounted partition:

           tar cf - /data/logs|gzip| e2cp - /dev/hdb1:/backup/logs.tar.gz

       Copy the files from one directory and put them under another directory
       on an unmounted partition, keeping the original paths, permissions &
       ownership:

           find /data -type f |tee filelist | e2cp -apv -d /dev/hdb1:/mirror

       Copy files from a directory on an unmounted partition to a local
       directory (Note: this does not recreate the directories in the local
       filesystem, yet).  The list of files are read from standard input:

           e2cp -pv -s /dev/hdb1:/mirror -d /data2 < filelist

       Copy a file to a file system and make the group and ownership root

           e2cp -G 0 -O 0 myfile /tmp/boot.img/boot/rootfile
