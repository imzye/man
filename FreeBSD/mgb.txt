MGB(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 MGB(4)

NAME
     mgb – Microchip LAN743x PCIe Gigabit Ethernet driver

SYNOPSIS
     To load the driver as a module at boot time, place the following line in
     loader.conf(5):

           if_mgb_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The mgb driver is experimental, and has a number of caveats and
     limitations.  It is currently available only as a kernel module.

     The mgb device driver provides support for PCIe Gigabit Ethernet adapters
     based on Microchip's LAN7430 and LAN7431.

     For more information on configuring this device, see ifconfig(8).

HARDWARE
     The mgb driver supports:

     •   Microchip LAN7430 PCIe Gigabit Ethernet controller with PHY
     •   Microchip LAN7431 PCIe Gigabit Ethernet controller with RGMII
         interface

SEE ALSO
     arp(4), miibus(4), ifconfig(8)

CAVEATS
     The driver does not yet implement support for many hardware features,
     including:
     •   Multiple RX queue support
     •   RX and TX checksum offload
     •   Hardware VLAN tagging or untagging
     •   Multicast receive packet filtering
     •   Wake on LAN (WoL)
     •   LSO
     •   RSS

     LAN7431 support is completely untested.
