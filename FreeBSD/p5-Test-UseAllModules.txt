Test::UseAllModules(3)                     User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Test::UseAllModules - do use_ok() for all the MANIFESTed modules

SYNOPSIS
         # basic usage
         use strict;
         use Test::UseAllModules;

         BEGIN { all_uses_ok(); }

         # if you also want to test modules under t/lib
         use strict;
         use Test::UseAllModules under => qw(lib t/lib);

         BEGIN { all_uses_ok(); }

         # if you have modules that'll fail use_ok() for themselves
         use strict;
         use Test::UseAllModules;

         BEGIN {
           all_uses_ok except => qw(
             Some::Dependent::Module
             Another::Dependent::Module
             ^Yet::Another::Dependent::.*   # you can use regex
           )
         }

DESCRIPTION
       I'm sick of writing 00_load.t (or something like that) that'll do
       use_ok() for every module I write. I'm sicker of updating 00_load.t
       when I add another file to the distro. This module reads MANIFEST to
       find modules to be tested and does use_ok() for each of them. Now all
       you have to do is update MANIFEST. You don't have to modify the test
       any more (hopefully).

EXPORTED FUNCTION
   all_uses_ok
       Does Test::More's use_ok() for every module found in MANIFEST. If you
       have modules you don't want to test, give those modules or some regex
       rules as the argument. The word 'except' is ignored as shown above.

       As of 0.11, you can also test modules under arbitrary directories by
       providing a directory list at the loading time (the word 'under' is
       ignored as shown above). Modules under the lib directory are always
       tested.

PROTECTED FUNCTION
   _get_module_list
       Returns module paths to test. This function will not be exported. If
       you want to use this (see below), you always need to call it by the
       full qualified name.

NOTES
       As of 0.03, this module calls BAIL_OUT of Test::More if any of the
       use_ok tests should fail. (Thus the following tests will be ignored.
       Missing or unloadable modules cause a lot of errors of the same kind.)

       As of 0.12, you can add extra tests before/after all_uses_ok() if you
       explicitly declare test plan like this.

         use strict;
         use warnings;
         use Test::More;
         use Test::UseAllModules;
         use Test::NoWarnings;

         plan tests => Test::UseAllModules::_get_module_list() + 1;

         all_uses_ok();

         # and extra nowarnings test

SEE ALSO
       There're several modules like this on the CPAN now. Test::Compile and a
       bit confusing Test::LoadAllModules try to find modules to test by
       traversing directories. I'm not a big fan of them as they tend to find
       temporary or unrelated modules as well, but they may be handier
       especially if you're too lazy to update MANIFEST every time.
