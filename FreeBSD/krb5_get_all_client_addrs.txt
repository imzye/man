KRB5_GET_ADDRS(3)      FreeBSD Library Functions Manual      KRB5_GET_ADDRS(3)

NAME
     krb5_get_all_client_addrs, krb5_get_all_server_addrs – return local
     addresses

LIBRARY
     Kerberos 5 Library (libkrb5, -lkrb5)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <krb5.h>

     krb5_error_code
     krb5_get_all_client_addrs(krb5_context context, krb5_addresses *addrs);

     krb5_error_code
     krb5_get_all_server_addrs(krb5_context context, krb5_addresses *addrs);

DESCRIPTION
     These functions return in addrs a list of addresses associated with the
     local host.

     The server variant returns all configured interface addresses (if
     possible), including loop-back addresses. This is useful if you want to
     create sockets to listen to.

     The client version will also scan local interfaces (can be turned off by
     setting libdefaults/scan_interfaces to false in krb5.conf), but will not
     include loop-back addresses, unless there are no other addresses found.
     It will remove all addresses included in libdefaults/ignore_addresses but
     will unconditionally include addresses in libdefaults/extra_addresses.

     The returned addresses should be freed by calling krb5_free_addresses().
