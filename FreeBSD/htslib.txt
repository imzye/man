NAME
       annot-tsv - transfer annotations from one TSV (tab-separated values)
       file into another

SYNOPSIS
       annot-tsv [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       The program finds overlaps in two sets of genomic regions (for example
       two CNV call sets) and annotates regions of the target file (-t,
       --target-file) with information from overlapping regions of the source
       file (-s, --source-file).

       It can transfer one or multiple columns (-f, --transfer) and the
       transfer can be conditioned on requiring matching values in one or more
       columns (-m, --match).  In addition to column transfer (-f) and special
       annotations (-a, --annotate), the program can operate in a simple grep-
       like mode and print matching lines (when neither -f nor -a are given)
       or drop matching lines (-x, --drop-overlaps).

       All indexes and coordinates are 1-based and inclusive.

OPTIONS
   Common Options
       -c, --core SRC:TGT
           List of names of the core columns, in the order of chromosome,
           start and end positions, irrespective of the header name and order
           in which they appear in source or target files (for example
           "chr,beg,end:CHROM,START,END").  If both files use the same header
           names, the TGT names can be omitted (for example "chr,beg,end").
           If SRC or TGT file has no header, 1-based indexes can be given
           instead (for example "chr,beg,end:3,1,2").  Note that regions are
           not required, the program can work with a list of positions (for
           example "chr,beg,end:CHROM,POS,POS").

       -f, --transfer SRC:TGT
           Comma-separated list of columns to transfer. If the SRC column does
           not exist, interpret it as the default value to fill in when a
           match is found or a dot (".") when a match is not found. If the TGT
           column does not exist, a new column is created. If the TGT column
           already exists, its values will be overwritten when overlap is
           found and left as is otherwise.

       -m, --match SRC:TGT
           The columns required to be identical

       -o, --output FILE
           Output file name, by default the result is printed on standard
           output

       -s, --source-file FILE
           Source file with annotations to transfer

       -t, --target-file FILE
           Target file to be extend with annotations from -s, --source-file

   Other options
       --allow-dups
           Add the same annotations multiple times if multiple overlaps are
           found

       --help
           This help message

       --max-annots INT
           Add at most INT annotations per column to save time when many
           overlaps are found with a single region

       --version
           Print version string and exit

       -a, --annotate LIST
           Add one or more special annotation and its target name separated by
           ':'. If no target name is given, the special annotation's name will
           be used in output header.

           cnt
               number of overlapping regions

           frac
               fraction of the target region with an overlap

           nbp
               number of source base pairs in the overlap

       -d, --delim SRC:TGT
           Column delimiter in the source and the target file. For example, if
           both files are comma-delimited, run with "--delim ,:," or simply
           "--delim ,". If the source file is comma-delimited and the target
           file is tab-delimited, run with "-d $',:\t'".

       -h, --headers SRC:TGT
           Line number of the header row with column names. By default the
           first line is interpreted as header if it starts with the comment
           character ("#"), otherwise expects numeric indices. However, if the
           first line does not start with "#" but still contains the column
           names, use "--headers 1:1". To ignore existing header (skip comment
           lines) and use numeric indices, use "--headers 0:0" which is
           equivalent to "--ignore-headers". When negative value is given, it
           is interpreted as the number of lines from the end of the comment
           block. Specifically, "--headers -1" takes the column names from the
           last line of the comment block (e.g., the "#CHROM" line in the VCF
           format).

       -H, --ignore-headers
           Ignore the headers completely and use numeric indexes even when a
           header exists

       -I, --no-hdr-idx
           Suppress index numbers in the printed header. If given twice, drop
           the entire header.

       -O, --overlap FLOAT,[FLOAT]
           Minimum overlap as a fraction of region length in SRC and TGT,
           respectively (with two numbers), or in at least one of the
           overlapping regions (with a single number). If also -r,
           --reciprocal is given, require at least FLOAT overlap with respect
           to both regions. Two identical numbers are equivalent to running
           with -r, --reciprocal

       -r, --reciprocal
           Require the -O, --overlap with respect to both overlapping regions

       -x, --drop-overlaps
           Drop overlapping regions (cannot be combined with -f, --transfer)

EXAMPLE
       Both SRC and TGT input files must be tab-delimited files with or
       without a header, their columns can be named differently, can appear in
       arbitrary order. For example consider the source file


       #chr   beg   end   sample   type   qual
       chr1   100   200   smpl1    DEL    10
       chr1   300   400   smpl2    DUP    30

       and the target file

       150   200   chr1   smpl1
       150   200   chr1   smpl2
       350   400   chr1   smpl1
       350   400   chr1   smpl2

       In the first example we transfer type and quality but only for regions
       with matching sample. Notice that the header is present in SRC but not
       in TGT, therefore we use column indexes for the latter

       annot-tsv -s src.txt.gz -t tgt.txt.gz -c chr,beg,end:3,1,2 -m sample:4 -f type,qual
       150   200   chr1   smpl1   DEL   10
       150   200   chr1   smpl2   .     .
       350   400   chr1   smpl1   .     .
       350   400   chr1   smpl2   DUP   30

       The next example demonstrates the special annotations nbp and cnt, with
       target name as pair,count.  In this case we use a target file with
       headers so that column names will be copied to the output:

       #from     to   chrom     sample
       150  200  chr1 smpl1
       150  200  chr1 smpl2
       350  400  chr1 smpl1
       350  400  chr1 smpl2



       annot-tsv -s src.txt.gz -t tgt_hdr.txt.gz -c chr,beg,end:chrom,from,to -m sample -f type,qual -a nbp,cnt:pair,count
       #[1]from  [2]to     [3]chrom  [4]sample [5]type   [6]qual   [7]pair   [8]count
       150  200  chr1 smpl1     DEL  10   51   1
       150  200  chr1 smpl2     .    .    0    0
       350  400  chr1 smpl1     .    .    0    0
       350  400  chr1 smpl2     DUP  30   51   1

       One of the SRC or TGT file can be streamed from stdin

       cat src.txt | annot-tsv -t tgt.txt -c chr,beg,end:3,2,1 -m sample:4 -f type,qual -o output.txt
       cat tgt.txt | annot-tsv -s src.txt -c chr,beg,end:3,2,1 -m sample:4 -f type,qual -o output.txt


       The program can be used in a grep-like mode to print only matching
       regions of the target file without modifying the records


       annot-tsv -s src.txt -t tgt.txt -c chr,beg,end:3,2,1 -m sample:4
       150   200   chr1   smpl1
       350   400   chr1   smpl2
