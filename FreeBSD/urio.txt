URIO(4)                FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                URIO(4)

NAME
     urio – USB driver for the Rio MP3 players

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following line in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device urio

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           urio_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The urio driver provides support for Rio MP3 players from Diamond
     MultiMedia which attaches to the USB port.  The urio device must be
     configured in the kernel, along with usb and one of the uhci or ohci
     controllers.

     Subsequently, the /dev/urio0 device can be used by the Rio userland
     applications.

HARDWARE
     The following devices are supported by the urio driver:

     •   Diamond MultiMedia Rio 500
     •   Diamond MultiMedia Rio 600
     •   Diamond MultiMedia Rio 800

FILES
     /dev/urio0
                blocking device node

EXAMPLES
     The following line in the kernel configuration file adds the urio driver
     to the kernel:
           device urio

     To download a song over the USB connection into the Rio using the
     rio_add_song(1) utility (see the SEE ALSO section):
           rio_add_song /usr/local/MP3/TracyChapman/02-Fast-Car.mp3

SEE ALSO
     ohci(4), uhci(4), usb(4)

     The Rio 500 SourceForge Project Web Page, http://rio500.sourceforge.net/.

     The Rio500 tools from SourceForge are the actual userland tools used to
     download, format or rename songs on players.  When compiling these tools,
     the following pre-build configuration command will ensure that rio_usb.h
     is available in the include path and that the device used is /dev/urio0:

           CFLAGS="-I/usr/include/dev/usb" ./configure \
               --with-devicepath='/dev' --with-deviceentry='urio0'
