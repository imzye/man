NAME
       List::UtilsBy::XS - XS implementation of List::UtilsBy

SYNOPSIS
         use List::UtilsBy::XS qw(sort_by);

         sort_by { $_->{foo} } @hash_ref_list

       You can use those functions same as List::UtilsBy ones, but some
       functions have limitation. See LIMITATION section.

DESCRIPTION
       List::UtilsBy::XS is XS implementation of List::UtilsBy.  Functions are
       more fast than original ones.

FUNCTIONS
       Same as List::UtilsBy

       List::UtilsBy::XS implements following functions.

       sort_by
       nsort_by
       rev_sort_by
       rev_nsort_by
       max_by (alias nmax_by)
       min_by (alias nmin_by)
       uniq_by
       partition_by
       count_by
       zip_by
       unzip_by
       extract_by
       weighted_shuffle_by
       bundle_by

LIMITATIONS
       Some functions are implemented by lightweight callback API.  "sort_by",
       "rev_sort_by", "nsort_by", "rev_nsort_by", "min_by", "max_by",
       "nmin_by", "nmax_by", "uniq_by", "partion_by", "count_by",
       "extract_by", "weighted_shuffle_by" are limited some features.

       Limitations are:

   Don't change argument $_ in code block
       List::UtilsBy localizes $_ in the code block, but List::UtilsBy::XS
       doesn't localize it and it is only alias same as "map", "grep". So you
       should not modify $_ in callback subroutine.

   Can't access to arguments as @_ in code block
       You can access argument as only $_ and cannot access as @_, $_[n].
