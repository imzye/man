NAME
       plank - elegant and simple dock

DESCRIPTION
       Plank Reloaded is a fork of the original Plank project, focusing on
       Cinnamon desktop compatibility and modernized features. Like its
       predecessor, it aims to be the simplest dock on the planet, providing
       just what a dock needs and absolutely nothing more. It remains a
       library which can be extended to create other dock programs with more
       advanced features.
