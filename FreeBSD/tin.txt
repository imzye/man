OPT-CASE(1)        Optimize case insensitive regexp filters        OPT-CASE(1)


NAME
       opt-case.pl - Optimize case insensitive regexp filters for tin

SYNOPSIS
       opt-case.pl < input [> output]

DESCRIPTION
       opt-case.pl reads a tin(1) filter-file (tin(5)) with regexp filters on
       STDIN and turns all case insensitive regexp into case sensitive ones
       whenever possible, as case sensitive regexp are (a bit) faster.

NOTES
       The case= line must come before any line with a regexp pattern, (that
       is the order tin(1) saves the filter file, if you created the filter by
       hand and never let tin(1) rewrite the file, you might want to check
       that first).

       Don't use opt-case.pl on wildmat filters, transform them into regexp
       filter via w2r.pl(1) first.
