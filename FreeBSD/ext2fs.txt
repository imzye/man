EXT2FS(5)                 FreeBSD File Formats Manual                EXT2FS(5)

NAME
     ext2fs – ext2/ext3/ext4 file system

SYNOPSIS
     To link into the kernel:

           options EXT2FS

     To load as a kernel loadable module:

           kldload ext2fs

DESCRIPTION
     The ext2fs driver will permit the FreeBSD kernel to access ext2 file
     systems and its derivatives.  It currently implements most of the
     features required by ext3 and ext4 file systems.  Support for Extended
     Attributes in ext4 is experimental.  Journalling and encryption are
     currently not supported.

EXAMPLES
     To mount a ext2fs volume located on /dev/ada1s1:

           mount -t ext2fs /dev/ada1s1 /mnt

SEE ALSO
     nmount(2), unmount(2), fstab(5), mount(8)

HISTORY
     The ext2fs driver first appeared in FreeBSD 2.2.

AUTHORS
     The ext2fs kernel implementation is derived from code written, or
     modified, by Godmar Back using the UFS CSRG sources for CMU Mach.

     John Dyson did the initial port to FreeBSD.  Aditya Sarawgi merged
     important parts of the allocation code from a clean-room NetBSD
     implementation.  Zheng Liu and Fedor Upurov implemented the read and
     write support respectively for ext4 filesystems.  The FreeBSD community
     has contributed a huge amount of modifications.

     The initial version of this manual page was written by Craig Rodrigues
     <rodrigc@FreeBSD.org>.
