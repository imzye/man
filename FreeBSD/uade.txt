UADE(1)                                                                UADE(1)

NAME
       UADE - Unix Amiga Delitracker Emulator

SYNOPSIS
       uade123 [options] files ...

DESCRIPTION
       uade123 plays old amiga music formats by emulating Amiga hardware. It
       re-uses Amiga Eagleplayer plugins to play different formats.
       Eagleplayer plugins require an implementation of the Eagleplayer API
       and AmigaOS APIs to run on. Therefore Eagleplayer API and parts of
       AmigaOS have been implemented in uade.

       uade123 is a command line player that can be used to play Amiga songs.
       It's options and behavior are documented here. There is also a plugin
       for the audacious.

       Section FILE FORMAT DETECTION explains hardships of recognizing amiga
       formats and consequently problems it may cause for the user (and
       authors).

       Section COMMAND LINE OPTIONS documents command line options for
       uade123.

       Section ACTION KEYS documents action keys which are used to issue run-
       time commands to control playback. These commands include switching
       subsong, skipping to next song, skipping fast forward, pausing and
       altering post-processing effects.

       Section CONFIGURATION FILES documents variables which can be changed in
       eagleplayer.conf, song.conf and uade.conf to alter default behavior of
       uade123 and other frontends.  eagleplayer.conf is used for eagleplayer
       plugin specific configurations.  song.conf is used for song specific
       configurations which can be used to change sound effects or avoid
       problems.  uade.conf is the main configuration file that can be used to
       set defaults for variables. Command line options will always override
       uade.conf options.


FILE FORMAT DETECTION
       Creating file detection heuristics for 200 formats is difficult and
       most of those formats are undocumented or otherwise not easily
       recognizable. Therefore we have to detect some formats by file name
       prefixes and postfixes which can easily cause problems. For example,
       many different protracker variants are named with 'mod' prefix and the
       format lacks version number inside the data file making it rather hard
       to recognize proper mod variant.  Sound output can be buggy with some
       unrecognizable mod variants. When file format can not be deduced based
       on file contents, a heuristics based on the file name must be used.
       This may sound strange, but many of the m68k machine language player
       plugins are black boxes which have no reliable mechanism to validate
       whether a given file belongs to them or not.  The filename based
       heuristics may cause unrecognized songs in uade123.  In audacious
       plugin they can cause conflicts with other plugins.


COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
       -1, --one Play at most one subsong per file.

       -@ filename, --list=filename
              Play song files listed in the file.

       --ao-option=x:y
              Set option for libao, where 'x' is an audio driver specific
              option and 'y' is a value. Note 'x' may not contain ´:´
              character, but 'y' may. This option can be used multiple times
              to specify multiple options.

              Example for alsa09 plugin: --ao-option=dev:default

       --buffer-time=x
              Set audio buffer length to x milliseconds. It can be used to
              avoid audio underruns on some systems. The default value of this
              setting is provided by the libao. Notice that libao support for
              ALSA has a bug in versions 0.8.6 and earlier that buffer_time
              must actually be given in microseconds rather than milliseconds.

       -d, --debug
              Turn debug mode on. Experts only.

       --detect-format-by-content
              Set file magic mode. The songs are only detected by file
              contents.  File name based heuristics (prefixes and postfixes)
              are not used.

       --disable-timeouts
              Disable timeouts. The frontend will never timeout a song.

       --enable-timeouts
              Enable timeouts. The frontend will normally timeout a song.

       -e format
              Set output file format (au, raw, wav). Use with -f.

       -f filename
              Output sound data to filename.

       --filter
              Enable filter emulation. It is enabled by default but could be
              disabled from uade.conf.

       --filter=x
              Set filter emulation mode to x.  x is a500, a1200 or none. A500
              is the default. 'none' means disabling the filter. Please note
              that A500 and A1200 are audibly different on every song even if
              a song doesn't use filtering.  Surprisingly, the biggest
              difference between A500 and A1200 is filter behavior when LED is
              off (i.e.  song doesn't use filtering). When LED is off, A1200
              does very little filtering but A500 does some filtering that can
              be easily heard. Please try switching between A500 and A1200
              modes. You should get same results with real Amigas too :-)

       --force-led=x
              Force Amiga filter on or off. 0 means "OFF" and 1 means "ON".

       --frequency=x
              Set output frequency to x Hz. The default is 44,1 kHz. Note that
              this option applies to all frontends (including Audacious
              plugin).

       -G, --gain=x
              Set volume gain to x.  x must be a non-negative value. The
              default value is 1,0.

       -g, --get-info
              Print playername and subsong information to stdout and then
              exit. This is useful for recording script.

       --headphones
              Enable headphones postprocessing effect.

       --headphones2
              Enable headphones 2 postprocessing effect.

       -h, --help
              Print command line help.

       -i,  --ignore
              Force eagleplayer to play the song.

       -j x, --jump=x
              Jump to song position of x seconds.

       -k x, --keys=x
              Turn action keys on (x = 1) or off (x = 0).

       -n, --no-ep-end-detect
              Play music ad infinitum by ignoring song end reported by the
              eagleplayer.  Note that this does not affect timeouts.

       --ntsc Set NTSC mode. This can be buggy.

       --pal  Set PAL mode. This is the default.

       -p x, --panning=x
              Set panning effect to x. This means mixing left and right
              channel affinely together. n is a value between 0 and 2. 0 is
              full stereo, 1 is mono and 2 is inverse stereo.

       -P playerfile
              Set filename of the eagleplayer.

       -r, --recursive
              Play directories recursively.

       --repeat
              Play playlist over and over again.

       --resampler=s
              Set resampling method to s.  It can be default, sinc or none.
              See RESAMPLERS section for more information.

       -s n, --subsong=n
              Choose subsong n.

       -S scorefile
              Set filename of sound core. Experts only. Useful for debugging
              sound core related problems. Picking score file from earlier
              releases may help revealing the problem source.

       --scope
              Turn on audio register debug mode. Prints Paula hardware
              register hits on the command line.  Support for this option has
              to be enabled from the configure script (--with-text-scope).

       --set="option1 option2 ..."
              Set song.conf options for given songs. uade123 will not play
              anything if --set is used. --set makes uade123 remember song
              specific options for future playback. For example, this option
              is useful for working around bugs in ripped songs (and even uade
              ;-).  Example: Set volume gain to 2 for mod.foo:

              uade123 --set="gain=2" mod.foo.

              Another example: Force mod.uptim8 to be played as a Startrekker
              4 song:

              uade123 --set="player=PTK-Prowiz epopt=type:flt4" mod.uptim8

              mod.level6h in the "Disposable Hero" requires vblank timing for
              the protracker replayer:

              uade123 --set='epopt=vblank' mod.level6h


       --speed-hack
              Enable speedhack. Emulate all instructions to be executed in one
              m68k cycle. Some players, such as EMS v6, take too many m68k
              cycles to be real-time. This option gives them enough m68k
              cycles. Notice that you do _not_ need to use this switch with
              EMS v6 or Octamed, because it is automatically enabled for those
              formats. A replayer usually knows to ask for speedhack.

       --stderr
              Print all messages on stderr. This is useful if one uses -f
              /dev/stdout as a trick to pipe sample data on the command line.

       -t x, --timeout=x
              Set song time out to x seconds. Default is infinite (-1).

       -w x, --subsong-timeout=x
              Set subsong timeout to x seconds. -1 means infinite. Default is
              512 seconds.

       -v, --verbose
              Turn verbose mode on. This is useful for debugging strange
              situations.

       -x, --ep-option=y
              Use eagleplayer option y. For example, to force a module to be
              played as a Protracker 1.1b module, execute: uade123 -x
              type:pt11b mod.foobar

       -y x, --silence-timeout=x.
              Set silence timeout to x seconds. If x seconds of silence is
              detected the (sub)song ends.

       -z, --shuffle
              Randomize playlist order before playing.

       --write-audio filename
              Write a paula events and register writes to a given filename.
              This can be used to generate an oscilloscope view video. See
              write_audio/README.md for more info.


ACTION KEYS
       uade123 can be controlled interactively on the command line by pressing
       specific action keys.
        [0-9]         Change subsong.
        '<'           Previous song.
        '.'           Skip 10 seconds forward.
        SPACE, 'b'    Next subsong.
        'c'           Pause.
        'f'           Toggle filter (takes filter control away from
       eagleplayer).
        'g'           Toggle gain effect.
        'h'           Print keyboard commands (this list)
        'H'           Toggle headphones effect.
        RETURN, 'n'   Next song.
        'p'           Toggle postprocessing effects.
        'P'           Toggle panning effect. Default value is 0,7.
        'q'           Quit.
        's'           Toggle between shuffle mode and normal play.
        'v'           Toggle verbose mode.
        'x'           Restart current subsong.
        'z'           Previous subsong.

CONFIGURATION FILES
       All configuration files are in a line based format. This means that
       line breaks (\n) must be used properly. Lines beginning with # are
       comment lines. Empty lines are ignored.

eagleplayer.conf
       Each line in eagleplayer.conf sets eagleplayer specific options. It is
       used, among other things, to specify file name extensions to different
       formats. It has the format:

       playername prefixes=prefix1,prefix2,... [opt1 opt2 ...] [comment]

       playername refers to an existing eagleplayer in players/ directory.
       prefixes is a list of file prefixes and postfixes that are associated
       with this eagleplayer.  opt1, opt2 and so forth are options that can be
       given to the player.

       Valid options for eagleplayer.conf are listed in the song.conf section.

       Some example lines for eagleplayer.conf:

       custom          prefixes=cust
       fred            prefixes=fred           broken_song_end
       PTK-Prowiz      prefixes=mod,pha,pp10   always_ends
       EMSv6           prefixes=emsv6          speed_hack
       foobar          comment: this format is not detected by a filename
                       prefix but file content as it should be

song.conf
       song.conf is a configuration file for applying work-arounds for songs
       that have problems with eagleplayers. Protracker is especially
       notorious for having many incompatible versions, and modules do not
       have version information about the editor which was used to create
       them.  One can program song.conf rules for songs by using the --set
       option in uade123. For example, forcing a module into vblank timing,
       do: "uade123 --set='epopt=vblank' mod.level6h"

       The file shall have lines of following format:

       md5=XXX option1 [option2 ...] [comment: YYY]

       Valid options for eagleplayer.conf and song.conf:

       a500                 Use A500 filter emulation
       a1200                Use A1200 filter emulation
       always_ends          A song will always end. This means that song end
                            detection code is perfect so timeouts in uade.conf
                            can be ignored. However, timeouts given from
                            command line will override this setting.
       broken_song_end      Song end reported by the eagleplayer is ignored
       detect_format_by_content  A song can only be detected by contents,
                            never by filename prefix or postfix
       epopt=x              Append option x for eagleplayer. Valid options
                            are listed in section "EAGLEPLAYER OPTIONS".
       gain=x               Set gain value to x
       ignore_player_check  Eagleplayer tries to play the song even if it is
                            not recognized as being in proper format. One
                            can use this option with bad eagleplayers in
                            eagleplayer.conf and bad rips in song.conf.
       led_off              Force LED off
       led_on               Force LED on
       no_ep_end_detect     Song end reported by the eagleplayer is ignored
       no_filter            No filtering (avoid this option, using a1200 is
                            better)
       no_headphones,       No headphone effect
       no_panning           No panning
       no_postprocessing    No postprocessing effects
       ntsc                 Uses NTSC timing (can be buggy)
       one_subsong          Play only one subsong per file
       pal                  Uses PAL timing
       panning=x            Set panning value to x
       player=name          Set eagleplayer, where name is the directory entry
                            in players/ dir. This option is not allowed in
                            eagleplayer.conf.
       reject               Reject a song (usable for blacklisting). This
                            option is not allowed in eagleplayer.conf.
       resampler=x          Set resampling method
       silence_timeout=x    Set silence timeout
       speed_hack           Enable speed hack
       subsongs=x,y,...     Set playable subsong (not implemented yet)
       subsong_timeout=x    Set subsong timeout
       timeout=x            Set timeout

       comment is a tag after which everything is considered just a comment
       about the line.

       Those options should be self-explanatory ;) A few example lines for
       song.conf:

       md5=09ad7aed28ec0043e232060546259767 broken_subsongs comment
       cust.Bubble_Bobble reports wrong subsong numbers

       md5=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx speed_hack comment this is the
       only song in format foo that needs speedhack

       md5=yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy led_off comment this song just
       sucks with filtering

       md5=zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz led_on comment turning LED ON
       makes this song sound c00l

       md5=wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww no_panning subsongs=2,5 comment
       only subsongs 2 and 5 sound good

       NTSC mode

uade.conf
       uade.conf sets default variables for configuration settings. Each line
       may contain at most one command. The configuration file is read from
       users home directory ( $HOME/.uade/uade.conf ) if it exists. If it does
       not exist, it is tried from $PREFIX/share/uade/uade.conf
        . Making a copy of the uade.conf into $HOME/.uade/ can be useful for
       users. The same uade.conf controls settings for all frontends.
       Specifically, this includes the audacious plugin too.

       The valid commands are:

           ao_option x:y      Set libao driver option with key=x and value=y.
                              See --ao-option=x:y for more information.
                              Example: ao_option dev:default
           buffer_time x      Set audio buffer length to x milliseconds.
           cygwin             Set Cygwin path name workaround mode.
                              See help for --cygwin option.
           detect_format_by_content  Only detect files by content. Do not
                              use file name based heuristics.
           disable_timeout    A song will never timeout.
           enable_timeout     A will timeout normally.
           filter x           Set filter emulation mode to be A500, A1200
                              or none.
           force_led x        Force LED "on" or "off"
           force_led_off      Same as "force_led off"
           force_led_on       Same as "force_led on"
           frequency x        Set output frequency to x Hz. The default is
                              44,1 kHz.
           gain x             Set gain value to x which is a non-negative
                              value. The default value is 1,0.
           headphones         Enable headphone effect.

           ignore_player_check    Force eagleplayers to recognize any given
                                  song.
           no_content_db      Disable song end database.
           no_ep_end_detect   Disable eagleplayers ability to end song.
                              See --no-ep-end-detect.
           no_filter          Same as "filter none".

EAGLEPLAYER OPTIONS
       Eagleplayers can be given song specific or general options in song.conf
       and eagleplayer.conf. Use epopt=x to set one option. It can be used
       many times. You can also issue eagleplayer options from the command
       line (so that they are not stored into song.conf) by using -x option:
       "uade123 -x type:nt10 mod.foobar" will play mod.foobar as a
       Noisetracker 1.0 module. With -x option "epopt=" prefix must be
       dropped.

       Valid options for eagleplayers:

       PTK-Prowiz          epopt=vblank
                           epopt=type:<tracker>
                                      <tracker> can be one of the following:
                                         st20  (Soundtracker 2.0 - 2.3)
                                         st24  (Soundtracker 2.4)
                                         nt10  (Noisetracker 1.x)
                                         nt20  (Noisetracker 2.x)
                                         m&k.  (Noisetracker M&K.)
                                         flt4  (Startrekker 4ch)
                                         pt10c (Protracker 1.0c)
                                         pt11b (Protracker 1.1b - 2.1a)

                           example: uade123 -x type:nt20 mod.foobar

       Infogrames          epopt=timer=x
                               This option is used to set playback speed.
                               Higher value means slower playback. This is the
                               CIA timer register value.
                               x is a hexadecimal value. The default is 1a00.

                               example: uade123 -x timer=24ff gobliins31.dum

SUPPORTED FORMATS
       Quite a few. See documentation, eagleplayer.conf and players/
       directory.

RESAMPLERS
       Internally Amigas Paula chip operates at 3,5 MHz, and in theory, it is
       possible to generate a 1,75 MHz output signal. However, maximum DMA
       based sample rate, which is approximately 28876 Hz, is limited by chip
       memory access slots. These frequencies are not well supported with
       current computer equipment, and synthesizing samples at 3,5 MHz would
       be very slow.  Regardless, in principle UADE "samples" Paula's output
       at 3,5 MHz and then immediately resamples it to playback frequency,
       which is usually 44,1 kHz or 1/80th of the sample rate of Paula. This
       output frequency is configurable, see uade.conf section.

       UADE currently supports three resampling methods: none that directly
       discards 79 of the 80 samples; default that estimates the true output
       value by averaging the last 80 samples together (also known as boxcar
       filter). This is the recommended resampler; and sinc that trades cpu
       for best high-frequency component removal through low-pass filtering
       the audio with a sinc function.

       The default resampler is a very good choice because it is pretty
       accurate and very fast, but loses some treble and causes some aliasing
       distortion.  For high frequencies (above 44,1 kHz), sinc becomes an
       option and is probably the best choice.

FILTERS
       The Amiga output circuitry contains a fixed low-pass filter on most
       models, and a dynamic lowpass filter connected to the power LED (known
       as the "LED filter"), which can be toggled on and off.  On the Amiga
       1000, which was the first Amiga computer, the LED filter was
       permanently enabled. In the succeeding models, such as the Amiga 500,
       the LED filter was made optional, but another, permanent RC filter
       circuit was added on the audio output. Finally, for Amiga 1200, the
       static filter was removed altogether, and only the LED filter remains.

       These low-pass filters were most likely added in order to make Amiga's
       pulse-based audio sound softer, and to make lower sampling frequencies
       useful for audio playback: by removing some of the treble, the hard
       edges of a pulse waveform become rounder and the waveform undulates
       more smoothly, mimicking many instrument sounds more accurately at
       lower sampling rates. The downside of fixed filtering is that the
       smoothing occurs with all the higher sampling rates, too.

       However, with the introduction of Amiga 1200 and its AGA graphics modes
       and spacious chip memory, it became possible to read more than 28876
       samples per second from chip memory, and we guess that the fixed
       lowpass filter was removed entirely in favour for accurate treble
       response.

       The filter emulation is based on hi-fi measurements made on two
       particular Amiga computers, Amiga 500 and Amiga 1200. The Amiga 500
       output path was found to contain a 6 dB/oct lowpass RC filter circuit
       with cutoff at 5000 Hz.  (Some early Amiga 500 revisions may have had
       4500 Hz tuning for this filter.)  The LED filter was found to be a 12
       dB/oct Butterworth lowpass filter with cutoff value at approximately
       3300 Hz. The details of the Amiga 1000 filter arrangements are not
       known, because nobody has been able to provide any samples.

       Accurate digital simulation of analog filters is usually not possible
       without some upsampling. When "default" method is used, the samples are
       generated at the playback frequency, and the post-processing step that
       applies filtering is composed with a series of hand-fitted first-order
       IIR filters that together approximate the correct frequency response
       for the expected synthesis frequencies of 44,1 kHz or 48 kHz.

       The sinc resampling method, in turn, emulates the filters directly at
       Paula's 3,5 MHz sampling frequency by folding the filters directly into
       the shape of the fundamental synthesis unit, the BLEP. In the sinc
       mode, the filters are realised by fitting the digital models for
       (slightly modified) butterworth and RC filters with the parameters
       mentioned above. Therefore sinc can be used on all frequencies above
       44.1 kHz without quality loss (or increase, for that matter).

UAERC
       You can edit PREFIX/share/uaerc to edit Amiga emulation related
       variable.

       INCREASING AMIGA MEMORY FOR LARGE MODULE FILES

       uaerc can be edited to increase Amiga memory. The variable named
       chipmem_size (4 by default) controls the memory allocation. The
       allocated memory size is determined by formula chipmem_size * 512 KiB,
       and thus, there is 2 MiB of memory available for modules by default.
       This variable can be set up to 16, which would mean 8 MiB of memory for
       modules.

       uade123 --set=epopt=type:pt10 mod.foo
              Set protracker compatibility to Protracker 1.0c for mod.foo.
              After this uade will remember epopt=type:pt10 for mod.foo.  See
              -x option also.


TIPS AND WORKAROUNDS
       1.     uade123 users libao to play audio. However, some distributions
              have a broken or badly configured libao. This can be
              workarounded with a simple shell script that uses ALSA's aplay
              for playback. It works for ordinary cases.  You can call it
              hackuade and issue "hackuade -zr /music/chip" on the command
              line. Put hackuade script somewhere in your command $PATH:

              #!/bin/sh

              uade123 -c "$@" |aplay
