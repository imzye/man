DESCRIPTION
       The slk* functions manipulate the set of soft function-key labels that
       exist on many terminals.  For those terminals that do not have soft
       labels, curses takes over the bottom line of stdscr, reducing the size
       of stdscr and the variable LINES.  curses standardizes on eight labels
       of up to eight characters each.  In addition to this, the ncurses
       implementation supports a mode where it simulates 12 labels of up to
       five characters each.  This is useful for PC-like enduser devices.
       ncurses simulates this mode by taking over up to two lines at the
       bottom of the screen; it does not try to use any hardware support for
       this mode.

   Initialization
       The slk_init routine must be called before initscr or newterm is
       called.  If initscr eventually uses a line from stdscr to emulate the
       soft labels, then fmt determines how the labels are arranged on the
       screen:

          0  indicates a 3-2-3 arrangement of the labels.

          1  indicates a 4-4 arrangement

          2  indicates the PC-like 4-4-4 mode.

          3  is again the PC-like 4-4-4 mode, but in addition an index line is
             generated, helping the user to identify the key numbers easily.

   Labels
       The slk_set routine (and the slk_wset routine for the wide-character
       library) has three parameters:

          labnum
               is the label number, from 1 to 8 (12 for fmt in slk_init is 2
               or 3);

          label
               is be the string to put on the label, up to eight (five for fmt
               in slk_init is 2 or 3) characters in length.  A null string or
               a null pointer sets up a blank label.

          fmt  is either 0, 1, or 2, indicating whether the label is to be
               left-justified, centered, or right-justified, respectively,
               within the label.

       The slk_label routine returns the current label for label number
       labnum, with leading and trailing blanks stripped.

   Screen updates
       The slk_refresh and slk_noutrefresh routines correspond to the wrefresh
       and wnoutrefresh routines.

       The slk_clear routine clears the soft labels from the screen.

       The slk_restore routine restores the soft labels to the screen after a
       slk_clear has been performed.

       The slk_touch routine forces all the soft labels to be output the next
       time a slk_noutrefresh is performed.

   Video attributes
       The slk_attron, slk_attrset, slk_attroff and slk_attr routines
       correspond to attron, attrset, attroff and attr_get, respectively.
       They have an effect only if soft labels are simulated on the bottom
       line of the screen.  The default highlight for soft keys is A_STANDOUT
       (as in System V curses, which does not document this fact).

   Colors
       The slk_color routine corresponds to color_set.  It has an effect only
       if soft labels are simulated on the bottom line of the screen.

       Because slk_color accepts only short (signed 16-bit integer) values,
       this implementation provides extended_slk_color which accepts an
       integer value, e.g., 32-bits.

RETURN VALUE
       These routines return ERR upon failure and OK (SVr4 specifies only "an
       integer value other than ERR") upon successful completion.

       X/Open defines no error conditions.  In this implementation

          slk_attr
               returns the attribute used for the soft keys.

          slk_attroff, slk_attron, slk_clear, slk_noutrefresh, slk_refresh,
          slk_touch
               return an error if the terminal or the softkeys were not
               initialized.

          slk_attrset
               returns an error if the terminal or the softkeys were not
               initialized.

          slk_attr_set
               returns an error if the terminal or the softkeys were not
               initialized, or the color pair is outside the range
               0..COLOR_PAIRS-1.

          slk_color
               returns an error if the terminal or the softkeys were not
               initialized, or the color pair is outside the range
               0..COLOR_PAIRS-1.

          slk_init
               returns an error if the format parameter is outside the range
               0..3.

          slk_label
               returns NULL on error.

          slk_set
               returns an error if the terminal or the softkeys were not
               initialized, or the labnum parameter is outside the range of
               label counts, or if the format parameter is outside the range
               0..2, or if memory for the labels cannot be allocated.

HISTORY
       SVr3 introduced these functions:
         slk_clear
         slk_init
         slk_label
         slk_noutrefresh
         slk_refresh
         slk_restore
         slk_set
         slk_touch

       SVr4 added these functions:
         slk_attroff
         slk_attron
         slk_attrset
         slk_start

       X/Open Curses added these:
         slk_attr_off
         slk_attr_on
         slk_attr_set
         slk_color
         slk_wset

EXTENSIONS
       X/Open Curses documents the opts argument as reserved for future use,
       saying that it must be null.  This implementation uses that parameter
       in ABI 6 for the functions which have a color-pair parameter to support
       extended color pairs.

       For  functions  which modify the color, e.g., slk_attr_set, if opts is
       set it is treated as a pointer to int, and used to  set  the  color
       pair instead of the short pair parameter.

NOTES
       Most applications would use slk_noutrefresh because a wrefresh is
       likely to follow soon.

PORTABILITY
       The XSI Curses standard, Issue 4, described the soft-key functions,
       with some differences from SVr4 curses:

       •   It added functions like the SVr4 attribute-manipulation functions
           slk_attron, slk_attroff, slk_attrset, but which use attr_t
           parameters (rather than chtype), along with a reserved opts
           parameter.

           Two of these new functions (unlike the SVr4 functions) have no
           provision for color: slk_attr_on and slk_attr_off.

           The third function (slk_attr_set) has a color-pair parameter.

       •   It added const qualifiers to parameters (unnecessarily), and

       •   It added slk_color.

       The format codes 2 and 3 for slk_init and the function slk_attr are
       specific to ncurses.

       X/Open Curses does not specify a limit for the number of colors and
       color pairs which a terminal can support.  However, in its use of short
       for the parameters, it carries over SVr4's implementation detail for
       the compiled terminfo database, which uses signed 16-bit numbers.  This
       implementation provides extended versions of those functions which use
       short parameters, allowing applications to use larger color- and pair-
       numbers.
