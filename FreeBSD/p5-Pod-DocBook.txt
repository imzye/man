NAME
       Pod::DocBook - Convert Pod data to DocBook SGML

SYNOPSIS
         use Pod::DocBook;
         my $parser = Pod::DocBook->new (title             => 'My Article',
                                         doctype           => 'article',
                                         fix_double_quotes => 1,
                                         spaces            => 3);

         $parser->parse_from_file ('my_article.pod', 'my_article.sgml');

DESCRIPTION
       Pod::DocBook is a module for translating Pod-formatted documents to
       DocBook 4.2 SGML (see <http://www.docbook.org/>).  It is primarily a
       back end for pod2docbook, but, as a Pod::Parser subclass, it can be
       used on its own.  The only public extensions to the Pod::Parser
       interface are options available to new():

       doctype
           This option sets the output document's doctype.  The currently
           supported types are article, chapter, refentry and section.
           Special processing is performed when the doctype is set to refentry
           (see "Document Types").  You must set this option in order to get
           valid DocBook output.

       fix_double_quotes
           If this option is set to a true value, pairs of double quote
           characters ('"') in ordinary paragraphs will be replaced with
           <quote> and </quote>.  See "Ordinary Paragraphs" for details.

       header
           If this option is set to a true value, Pod::DocBook will emit a
           DOCTYPE as the first line of output.

       spaces
           Pod::DocBook produces pretty-printed output.  This option sets the
           number of spaces per level of indentation in the output.

       title
           This option sets the output document's title.

       The rest of this document only describes issues specific to
       Pod::DocBook; for details on invoking the parser, specifically the
       new(), parse_from_file() and parse_from_filehandle() methods, see
       Pod::Parser.

POD TO DOCBOOK TRANSLATION
       Pod is a deceptively simple format; it is easy to learn and very
       straightforward to use, but it is suprisingly expressive.
       Nevertheless, it is not nearly as expressive or complex as DocBook.  In
       most cases, given some Pod, the analogous DocBook markup is obvious,
       but not always.  This section describes how Pod::DocBook treats Pod
       input so that Pod authors may make informed choices.  In every case,
       Pod::DocBook strives to make easy things easy and hard things possible.

       The primary motivation behind Pod::DocBook is to facilitate single-
       source publishing.  That is, you should be able to generate man pages,
       web pages, PDF and PostScript documents, or any other format your SGML
       and/or Pod tools can produce, from the same Pod source, without the
       need for hand-editing any intermediate files.  This may not always be
       possible, or you may simply choose to render Pod to DocBook and use
       that as your single source.  To satisfy the first requirement,
       Pod::DocBook always processes the entire Pod source and tries very hard
       to produce valid DocBook markup, even in the presence of malformed Pod
       (see "DIAGNOSTICS").  To satisfy the second requirement (and to be a
       little nifty), Pod::DocBook pretty-prints its output.  If you're
       curious about what specific output to expect, read on.

   Document Types
       DocBook's structure is very modular; many of its document types can be
       embedded directly into other documents.  Accordingly, Pod::DocBook will
       generate four different document types: article, chapter, refentry, and
       section.  This makes it easy, for instance, to write all the chapters
       of a book in separate Pod documents, translate them into DocBook markup
       and later glue them together before processing the entire book.  You
       could do the same with each section in an article, or you could write
       the entire article in a single Pod document.  Other document types,
       such as book and set, do not map easily from Pod, because they require
       structure for which there is no Pod equivalent.  But given sections and
       chapters, making larger documents becomes much simpler.

       The refentry document type is a little different from the others.
       Sections, articles, and chapters are essentially composed of nested
       sections.  But a refentry has specialized elements for the NAME and
       SYNOPSIS sections.  To accommodate this, Pod::DocBook performs extra
       processing on the Pod source when the doctype is set to refentry.  You
       probably don't have to do anything to your document to assist the
       processing; typical man page conventions cover the requirements.  Just
       make sure that the NAME and SYNOPSIS headers are both =head1s, that
       "NAME" and "SYNOPSIS" are both uppercase, and that =head1 NAME is the
       first line of Pod source.

   Ordinary Paragraphs
       Ordinary paragraphs in a Pod document translate naturally to DocBook
       paragraphs.  Specifically, after any formatting codes are processed,
       the characters "<", ">" and "&" are translated to their respective SGML
       character entities, and the paragraph is wrapped in <para> and </para>.

       For example, given this Pod paragraph:

         Here is some text with I<italics> & an ampersand.

       Pod::DocBook would produce DocBook markup similar to this:

         <para>
           Here is some text with <emphasis role="italic">italics</emphasis>
           &amp; an ampersand.
         </para>

       Depending on your final output format, you may sometimes want double
       quotes in ordinary paragraphs to show up ultimately as "smart quotes"
       (little 66s and 99s).  Pod::DocBook offers a convenient mechanism for
       handling double quotes in ordinary paragraphs and letting your SGML
       toolchain manage their presentation: the fix_double_quotes option to
       new().  If this option is set to a true value, Pod::DocBook will
       replace pairs of double quotes in ordinary paragraphs (and only in
       ordinary paragraphs) with <quote> and </quote>.

       For example, given this Pod paragraph:

         Here is some text with I<italics> & an "ampersand".

       Pod::DocBook, with fix_double_quotes set, would produce DocBook markup
       similar to this:

         <para>
           Here is some text with <emphasis role="italic">italics</emphasis>
           &amp; an <quote>ampersand</quote>.
         </para>

       If you have a paragraph with an odd number of double quotes, the last
       one will be left untouched, which may or may not be what you want.  If
       you have such a document, replace the unpaired double quote character
       with E<quot>, and Pod::DocBook should be able to give you the output
       you expect.  Also, if you have any =begin docbook ... =end docbook
       regions (see "Embedded DocBook Markup") in your Pod, you are
       responsible for managing your own quotes in those regions.

   Verbatim Paragraphs
       Verbatim paragraphs translate even more naturally; perlpodspec mandates
       that absolutely no processing should be performed on them.  So
       Pod::DocBook simply marks them as CDATA and wraps them in <screen> and
       </screen>.  They are not indented the way ordinary paragraphs are,
       because they treat whitespace as significant.

       For example, given this verbatim paragraph (imagine there's leading
       whitespace in the source):

         my $i = 10;
         while (<> && $i--) {
             print "$i: $_";
         }

       Pod::DocBook would produce DocBook markup similar to this:

         <screen><![CDATA[my $i = 10;
         while (<> && $i--) {
             print "$i: $_";
         }]] ></screen>

       Multiple contiguous verbatim paragraphs are treated as a single screen
       element, with blank lines separating the paragraphs, as dictated by
       perlpodspec.

   Command Paragraphs
       "=head1 Heading Text"
       "=head2 Heading Text"
       "=head3 Heading Text"
       "=head4 Heading Text"
           All of the Pod heading commands produce DocBook section elements,
           with the heading text as titles.  Pod::DocBook (perlpod) only
           allows for 4 heading levels, but DocBook allows arbitrary nesting;
           see "Embedded DocBook Markup" if you need more than 4 levels.
           Pod::DocBook only looks at relative heading levels to determine
           nesting.  For example, this bit of Pod:

             =head1 1

             Contents of section 1

             =head2 1.1

             Contents of section 1.1

           and this bit of Pod:

             =head1 1

             Contents of section 1

             =head3 1.1

             Contents of section 1.1

           both produce the same DocBook markup, which will look something
           like this:

             <section id="article-My-Article-1"><title>1</title>
               <para>
                 Contents of section 1
               </para>
               <section id="article-My-Article-1-1"><title>1.1</title>
                 <para>
                   Contents of section 1.1
                 </para>
               </section>
             </section>

           Note that Pod::DocBook automatically generates section identifiers
           from your doctype, document title and section title.  It does the
           same when you make internal links (see "Formatting Codes", ensuring
           that if you supply the same link text as you did for the section
           title, the resulting identifiers will be the same.

       "=over indentlevel"
       "=item stuff..."
       "=back"
           "=over" ... "=back" regions are somewhat complex, in that they can
           lead to a variety of DocBook constructs.  In every case,
           indentlevel is ignored by Pod::DocBook, since that's best left to
           your stylesheets.

           An "=over" ... "=back" region with no "=item"s represents indented
           text and maps directly to a DocBook blockquote element.  Given this
           source:

             =over 4

             This text should be indented.

             =back

           Pod::DocBook will produce DocBook markup similar to this:

             <blockquote>
               <para>
                 This text should be indented.
               </para>
             </blockquote>

           Inside an "=over" ... "=back" region, "=item" commands generate
           lists.  The text that follows the first "=item" determines the type
           of list that will be output:

           •   "*" (an asterisk) produces <itemizedlist>

           •   "1" or "1." produces <orderedlist numeration="arabic">

           •   "a" or "a." produces <orderedlist numeration="loweralpha">

           •   "A" or "A." produces <orderedlist numeration="upperalpha">

           •   "i" or "i." produces <orderedlist numeration="lowerroman">

           •   "I" or "I." produces <orderedlist numeration="upperroman">

           •   anything else produces <variablelist>

           Since the output from each of these is relatively verbose, the best
           way to see examples is to actually render some Pod into DocBook.

       "=pod"
       "=cut"
           Pod::Parser recognizes these commands, and, therefore, so does
           Pod::DocBook, but they don't produce any output.

       "=begin formatname"
       "=end formatname"
       "=for formatname text..."
           Pod::DocBook supports two formats: docbook, explained in "Embedded
           DocBook Markup", and table, explained in "Simple Tables".

       "=encoding encodingname"
           This command is currently not supported.  If Pod::DocBook
           encounters a document that contains "=encoding", it will ignore the
           command and report an error ("unknown command `%s' at line %d in
           file %s").

       Embedded DocBook Markup

       There are a wide range of DocBook structures for which there is no Pod
       equivalent.  For these, you will have to provide your own markup using
       =begin docbook ... =end docbook or =for docbook ....  Pod::DocBook will
       directly output whatever text you provide, unprocessed, so it's up to
       you to ensure that it's valid DocBook.

       Images, footnotes and many inline elements are obvious candidates for
       embedded markup.  Another possible use is nesting sections more than
       four-deep.  For example, given this source:

         =head1  1

         This is Section 1

         =head2 1.1

         This is Section 1.1

         =head3 1.1.1

         This is Section 1.1.1

         =head4 1.1.1.1

         This is Section 1.1.1.1

         =begin docbook

         <section>
         <title>1.1.1.1.1</title>
         <para>This is Section 1.1.1.1.1</para>
         </section>

         =end docbook

       Pod::DocBook will generate DocBook markup similar to this:

           <section id="article-My-Article-1"><title>1</title>
             <para>
               This is Section 1
             </para>
             <section id="article-My-Article-1-1"><title>1.1</title>
               <para>
                 This is Section 1.1
               </para>
               <section id="article-My-Article-1-1-1"><title>1.1.1</title>
                 <para>
                   This is Section 1.1.1
                 </para>
                 <section id="article-My-Article-1-1-1-1"><title>1.1.1.1</title>
                   <para>
                     This is Section 1.1.1.1
                   </para>
         <section>
         <title>1.1.1.1.1</title>
         <para>This is Section 1.1.1.1.1</para>
         </section>
                 </section>
               </section>
             </section>
           </section>

       Simple Tables

       Pod::DocBook also provides a mechanism for generating basic tables with
       =begin table and =end docbook.  If you have simple tabular data or a
       CSV file exported from some application, Pod::DocBook makes it easy to
       generate a table from your data.  The syntax is intended to be simple,
       so DocBook's entire table feature set is not represented, but even if
       you do need more complex table markup than Pod::DocBook produces, you
       can rapidly produce some markup which you can hand-edit and then embed
       directly in your Pod with =begin docbook ... =end docbook.  Each table
       definition spans multiple lines, so there is no equivalent =for table
       command.

       The first line of a table definition gives the table's title.  The
       second line gives a list of comma-separated column specifications
       (really just column alignments), each of which can be left, center or
       right.  The third line is a list of comma-separated column headings,
       and every subsequent line consists of comma-separated row data.  If any
       of your data actually contain commas, you can enclose them in double
       quotes; if they also contain double quotes, you must escape the inner
       quotes with backslashes (typical CSV stuff).

       Here's an example:

         =begin table

         Sample Table
         left,center,right
         Powers of Ten,Planets,Dollars
         10,Earth,$1
         100,Mercury,$5
         1000,Mars,$10
         10000,Venus,$20
         100000,"Jupiter, Saturn",$50

         =end table

       And here's what Pod::DocBook would do with it:

         <table>
           <title>Sample Table</title>
           <tgroup cols="3">
             <colspec align="left">
             <colspec align="center">
             <colspec align="right">
             <thead>
               <row>
                 <entry>Powers of Ten</entry>
                 <entry>Planets</entry>
                 <entry>Dollars</entry>
               </row>
             </thead>
             <tbody>
               <row>
                 <entry>10</entry>
                 <entry>Earth</entry>
                 <entry>$1</entry>
               </row>
               <row>

                 <entry>Mercury</entry>

               </row>
               <row>
                 <entry>1000</entry>
                 <entry>Mars</entry>
                 <entry>$10</entry>
               </row>
               <row>
                 <entry>10000</entry>
                 <entry>Venus</entry>
                 <entry>$20</entry>
               </row>
               <row>
                 <entry>100000</entry>
                 <entry>Jupiter, Saturn</entry>
                 <entry>$50</entry>
               </row>
             </tbody>
           </tgroup>
         </table>

   Formatting Codes
       Pod formatting codes render directly into DocBook as inline elements:

       •   "I<text>"

             <emphasis role="italic">text</emphasis>

       •   "B<text>"

             <emphasis role="bold">text</emphasis>

       •   "C<code>"

             <literal role="code"><![CDATA[code]] ></literal>

       •   "L<name>"

             <citerefentry><refentrytitle>name</refentrytitle></citerefentry>

       •   "L<name(n)>"

             <citerefentry><refentrytitle>name</refentrytitle>

DIAGNOSTICS
       Pod::DocBook makes every possible effort to produce valid DocBook
       markup, even with malformed POD source.  Any processing errors will be
       noted in comments at the end of the output document.  Even when errors
       occur, Pod::DocBook always reads the entire input document and never
       exits with a non-zero status.

       unknown command `%s' at line %d in file %s
           See "Command Paragraph" in perlpod for a list of valid commands.
           The command referenced in the error message was ignored.

       formatting code `%s' nested within `%s' at line %d in file %s
           See "Formatting Codes" in perlpod for details on which formatting
           codes can be nested.  The offending code was translated into the
           output document as the raw text inside its angle brackets.

       unknown formatting code `%s' at line in file %s
           The input contained a formatting code not listed in perlpod; it was
           translated into the output document as the raw text inside the
           angle brackets.

       empty L<> at line %d in file %s
           Self-explanatory.

       invalid escape `%s' at line %d in file %s
           Self-explanatory; it was translated into the output document as the
           raw text inside the angle brackets.

       =item must be inside an =over ... =back section at line %d in file %s
           Self-explanatory.  The `=item' referenced in the error was ignored.

       `=end %s' found but current region opened with `=begin %s'
           The closest `=end' command to the referenced `=begin' didn't match;
           processing continued as if the mismatched `=end' wasn't there.

       no matching `=end' for `=begin %s'
           Pod::DocBook reached the end of its input without finding an `=end'
           command to match the `=begin' referenced in the error; end-of-file
           processing continued.

       unknown colspec `%s' in table at line %d in file %s
           See "Simple Tables" for a list of supported column specifications.

       encountered unknown state `%s' (this should never happen)
           The state referred to is an internal variable used to properly
           manage nested DocBook structures.  You should indeed never see this
           message, but if you do, you should contact the module's author.

AUTHOR
       Alligator Descartes <descarte@symbolstone.org> wrote a module called
       Pod::DocBook, which was later maintained by Jan Iven
       <jan.iven@cern.ch>.  That module was based on the original pod2html by
       Tom Christiansen <tchrist@mox.perl.com>.

       Nandu Shah <nandu@zvolve.com> wrote this Pod::DocBook, which is
       unrelated to the previous module (even though they both perform the
       same function).
