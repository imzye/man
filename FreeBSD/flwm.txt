NAME
       flwm - The Fast Light Window Manager

SYNOPSIS
       flwm [-d[isplay] host:n.n] [-g[eometry] WxH+X+Y] [-fg color] [-bg
       color] [-bg2 color]

DESCRIPTION
       flwm is a very small and fast X window manager, featuring no icons and
       "sideways" title bars.


.xinitrc / .xsession
       To run flwm as your login script, you need to create or replace
       ~/.xinitrc or ~/.xsession (or both).  Newer Linux systems with a login
       panel use .xsession, older systems where X was started after login use
       .xinitrc.  You may also have to pick "default" from the "type of
       session" popup in your login window.

       The .xinitrc or .xsession file should look like this:

       #!/bin/sh
       xsetroot -solid \#006060
       xrdb .Xresources
       # xset, xmodmap, other configuration programs
       flwm &
       WindowManager=$!
       # xterm, other automatically-launched programs
       wait $WindowManager


SWITCHES
       -d[isplay] host:#.# Sets the display and screen for flwm to manage

       -v[isual] # Visual number to use (probably only works for non-color-
       mapped ones)

       -g[eometry] WxH+X+Y Flwm will act as though the screen is only the
       specified area.  It will constrain initial window positions to this
       area and stop them at the edges when dragging them around.  This can be
       used to surround the screen with fixed "toolbars" that are never
       covered by windows.  These toolbars must be created by a program using
       override-redirect so that flwm does not try to move them.

       -m[aximum] WxH Set the size of windows when the maximize buttons are
       pushed.  Normally this is the size of the screen.  This is useful for
       XFree86 servers that are run with a smaller screen than display memory.

       -x The menu will say "Exit" instead of "Logout" and will not ask for
       confirmation.  This is a good idea if you are running flwm in some
       other way than with exec at the end of .xinitrc, since it won't log you
       out then.

       -fg color, -bg color Set the label color and the color of the window
       frames and the menu.

       -c[ursor] # What cursor to use on the desktop (you will have to
       experiment to find out what each number means)

       -cfg color, -cbg color Colors for the desktop and window resizing
       cursors

       In addition to these switches there is much customization that can be
       done by editing the config.h file in the source code and recompiling.
       GCC is your friend.


MENU ITEMS
       Flwm can launch programs from its menu.  This is controlled by files in
       the directory ~/.wmx (this was chosen to be compatible with wmx and
       wm2).

       Each executable file in ~/.wmx is a program to run.  Usually these are
       symbolic links to the real program or very short shell scripts.

       Each subdirectory creates a child menu so you can build a hierarchy (up
       to 10 deep).

       Cut and paste the following lines you your shell to create some example
       files:

       mkdir ~/.wmx
       ln -s /usr/bin/gimp ~/.wmx/"The Gimp"
       cat << EOF > ~/.wmx/"Terminal"
       #! /bin/sh
       /usr/local/bin/rxvt -ut
       EOF
       chmod +x !*

       RedHat users can run the program flwm_wmconfig to read the
       /etc/X11/wmconfig directory and produce an initial set of menu items.


MOUSE USAGE
       Left-click on a window border raises window.

       Left-drag will move the window when in the title bar, and will resize
       it in the edges.  If the window cannot be resized then it will always
       move the window.  What it will do is indicated by the cursor shape.

       Middle-click on a window border lowers it to bottom.

       Middle-drag anywhere on window border will move the window.

       When you move a window it will stop at the edges of the screen.
       Dragging about 150 pixels further will unstick it and let you drag it
       off the screen.

       Right-click on a window border pops up the menu.

       Any button on the desktop will pop up the menu.


BUTTONS
       The empty button "iconizes" the window: it will completely vanish.  To
       get it back use the menu.

       The vertical-bar button "shades" (or "Venetian blinds"?) the window.
       Click it again to restore the window.  You can also resize the shaded
       window to a new height or "open" it by resizing horizontally.

       The two buttons below it toggle maximum height and/or maximum width.

       The X button at the bottom closes the window.


MENU
       Right-click on window border, or any-click on the desktop, or typing
       Alt+Esc or Alt+Tab or Alt+Shift+Tab will pop up the menu.

       Releasing Alt will pick the current menu item.  This makes flwm work
       very much (exactly?) like the Windows 95 shortcuts.

       Each main window is a menu item.  If the window is "iconized" the
       little picture shows an open rectangle, otherwise it shows a filled
       rectangle.  Picking a menu item deiconizes and raises that window and
       warps the pointer so it is current.

       New desktop asks for a name of a new desktop and makes it current.  The
       desktop will initially be empty (except for sticky items).

       To move windows to the current desktop, pop up the menu and pick
       windows off of other desktops (if using the keyboard, use left arrow to
       go to the desktop names, move up and down to the other desktop, and use
       right arrow to enter that desktop).  The window will be moved from the
       other desktop to the current one.

       To switch to another desktop, pick the title of the desktop (if using
       the keyboard, use left arrow to go to the desktop names, move up and
       down to the other desktop).

       If a desktop is empty you can delete it.  Its sub menu will show delete
       this desktop.  Pick that and the desktop is gone.

       Sticky is a special "desktop": windows on it appear on all desktops.
       To make a window "sticky" switch to the Sticky desktop and pick the
       window off its current desktop (thus "moving" it to the Sticky
       desktop).  To "unstick" a window go to another desktop and pick the
       window off the sticky desktop menu.

       New xterm will run a new xterm on the current desktop.  Useful if you
       accidentally close everything.  This item does not appear if a ~/.wmx
       directory exists.

       Logout will ask for confirmation and if so flwm will exit.

       Exit will exit flwm without confirmation.  This item will appear if
       flwm was run with the -x switch.


HOT KEYS
       These are the defaults, the hot keys may be different depending on how
       flwm was compiled:

       Alt+Escape Pops up the menu with the current window preselected

       Alt+Tab Pops up the menu with the next window preselected

       Alt+Shift+Tab Pops up the menu with the previous window preselected

       Ctrl+Tab Switch to the next desktop.

       Ctrl+Shift+Tab Switch to the previous desktop.

       Ctrl+Function key Switch to desktop N.

       Alt+Up Raise the current window.

       Alt+Down Lower the current window.

       Alt+Delete Close the current window (same as clicking close box).

       Alt+Enter "Iconizes" (hides) the current window.


BUGS
       It is impossible to move windows smaller than 100 pixels off the
       screen.

       Only obeys "keep aspect" if the aspect ratio is 1x1.
