DateTime::Event::NameDay(3)                User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       DateTime::Event::NameDay - Perl DateTime extension to work with
       namedays from various countries.

SYNOPSIS
         use DateTime::Event::NameDay;

         $nd = DateTime::Event::NameDay->new
           (country => "Sweden" ,
            date_args => {reform_date => $ref_dt} );

         @names = $nd->get_daynames( date => $dt);
         # Returns an array of the matching names

         $set = $nd->get_namedays(name => "Alfred");
         # Returns a DateTime::Set object that represents all of the
         # namedays for Alfred

         # Alternately you can call it without using an object, but
         # now you must specify the country rather than using the
         # one (optionally) passed to the constructor
         @names = DateTime::Event::NameDay->get_daynames
                      ( country => "France", date => $dt);
         $set   = DateTime::Event::NameDay->get_namedays
                      ( country => "France", name => "Basile");

DESCRIPTION
       DateTime::Event::NameDay is a class that knows the name days for
       various countries.  In some countries a person's nameday is more
       important than their birthday and gifts may be exchanged.

       There are two major functions of the class, the first takes a
       "DateTime" object (of any kind) and works out the names that are
       associated with that day.  The second takes a given name and returns a
       "DateTime::Set" object that can be used to work out what dates are for
       the given name.

       Please note that the calculations are done using the
       "DateTime::Calendar::Christian" module to deal with dates that fall
       before the calendar reforms.
