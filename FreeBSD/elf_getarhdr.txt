     ELF Access Library (libelf, -lelf)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <libelf.h>

     Elf_Arhdr *
     elf_getarhdr(Elf *elf);

DESCRIPTION
     The elf_getarhdr() function returns a pointer to an archive member header
     for a descriptor elf.  This descriptor must have been returned by a prior
     call to elf_begin(3), and must be a descriptor for a member inside an
     ar(1) archive.

     Structure Elf_Arhdr includes the following members:

     char * ar_name
             A pointer to a null terminated string containing the translated
             name of the archive member.

     char * ar_rawname
             A pointer to a null terminated string containing the untranslated
             name for the archive member, including all ar(1) formatting
             characters and trailing white space.

     time_t ar_date
             The timestamp associated with the member.

     uid_t ar_uid
             The uid of the creator of the member.

     gid_t ar_gid
             The gid of the creator of the member.

     mode_t ar_mode
             The file mode of the member.

     size_t ar_size
             The size of the member in bytes.

RETURN VALUES
     This function returns a valid pointer to an Elf_Arhdr structure if
     successful, or NULL if an error is encountered.

ERRORS
     Function elf_getarhdr() may fail with the following errors:

     [ELF_E_ARGUMENT]  Argument elf was NULL.

     [ELF_E_ARGUMENT]  Argument elf was not a descriptor for a member of an
                       ar(1) archive.
