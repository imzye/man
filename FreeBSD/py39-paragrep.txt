PARAGREP(1)             FreeBSD General Commands Manual            PARAGREP(1)



NAME
       paragrep - search paragraphs in a file for patterns

SYNOPSIS
       paragrep [ -aiotv ] [ -p eop_expression ] [ -e expression ] [ -f
       exp_file ] ...  [ file ] ...

       or

       paragrep [ -itv ] [ -p eop_expression ] expression [ file ] ...

DESCRIPTION
       Paragrep is a paragraph grep utility.  It searches for a series of
       regular expressions in a text file (or several text files) and prints
       out the paragraphs containing those expressions.  Normally a paragraph
       is displayed if it contains any of the expressions; this behavior can
       be modified by using the -a option.

       By default, a paragraph is defined as a block of text delimited by an
       empty or blank line; this behavior can be altered with the -p option.

       If no files are specified on the command line, paragrep searches
       standard input.

OPTIONS
       -a             The "and" option: Only display a paragraph if it
                      contains all the regular expressions specified.  The
                      default is to display a paragraph if it contains any of
                      the regular expressions specified. (See the -o option,
                      below.)

       -e expression  Adds a regular expression to the set of expressions
                      against which paragraphs are to be matched.   More than
                      one -e argument may be specified.  If only one
                      expression is specified, the -e may be omitted, as in
                      the second form of the command, above.

       -f expfile     Specifies a file containing regular expressions, one
                      expression per line.  Each expression in the file is
                      added to the set of expression against which paragraphs
                      are to be matched.   More than one -f argument is
                      permitted. Also, -f and -e may be specified together.

       -i             Considers upper- and lower-case letters to be identical
                      when making comparisons.

       -o             The "or" option: Display a paragraph if it contains any
                      of the regular expressions specified.  Since this option
                      is the default, it is rarely specified on the command
                      line.  It exists primarily to negate the effect of a
                      previous -a option.  (e.g., If you've defined an alias
                      for paragrep that specifies the -a option, -o would be
                      necessary to force the "or" behavior.)

       -p eop_expression
                      Specifies a regular expression to be used match
                      paragraph delimiters.  Any line that matches this
                      regular expression is assumed to delimit paragraphs
                      without actually being part of a paragraph (i.e., lines
                      matching this expression are never printed).  If this
                      option is not specified, it defaults to `^[ \t]*$' which
                      matches blank or empty lines.  (`\t' represents the
                      horizontal tab character.  If you need to specify a
                      horizontal tab, you'll need to type the actual
                      character; paragrep doesn't recognize C-style
                      metacharacters.)

       -v             Displays all lines that do not match specified
                      expressions.  The negation logic works on DeMorgan's
                      Laws.  Normally, if -a is specified, paragrep uses the
                      following logic to match the paragraph:

                             match = contains (expr1) AND contains (expr2) AND
                             contains (expr3) ...

                      Specifying -v along with -a changes this logic to:

                             match = lacks (expr1) OR lacks (expr2) OR lacks
                             (expr3) ...

                      Likewise, without -a or -v (i.e., using the -o option,
                      which is the default) the matching logic is:

                             match = contains (expr1) OR contains (expr1) OR
                             contains (expr1) ...

                      Negating that logic with -v causes paragrep to match
                      paragraphs with:

                             match = lacks (expr1) AND lacks (expr2) AND lacks
                             (expr3) ...

BUGS
       Paragrep's notion of troff directives is overly restrictive.  To be
       less restrictive, you must conjure up a more complicated -p value.

       Paragrep reads each paragraph into a perl array before scanning it for
       matches; as a result, extremely long paragraphs can suck up memory.

       The logic behind how -v works can be confusing to the uninitiated.
