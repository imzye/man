Geo::Coder::OpenCage(3)                    User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Geo::Coder::OpenCage - Geocode coordinates and addresses with the
       OpenCage Geocoding API

VERSION
       version 0.36

SYNOPSIS
           my $Geocoder = Geo::Coder::OpenCage->new(api_key => $my_api_key);

           my $response = $Geocoder->geocode(location => "Donostia");

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides an interface to the OpenCage geocoding service.

       For full details of the API visit <https://opencagedata.com/api>

       It is recommended you read the best practices for using the OpenCage
       geocoder <https://opencagedata.com/api#bestpractices> before you start.

METHODS
   new
           my $Geocoder = Geo::Coder::OpenCage->new(api_key => $my_api_key);

       Get your API key from <https://opencagedata.com>.

       Optionally "http => 1" can also be specified in which case API requests
       will NOT be made via https

   ua
           $ua = $geocoder->ua();
           $ua = $geocoder->ua($ua);

       Accessor for the UserAgent object. By default HTTP::Tiny is used.
       Useful if for example you want to specify that something like
       LWP::UserAgent::Throttled for rate limiting. Even if a new UserAgent is
       specified the useragent string will be specified as
       "Geo::Coder::OpenCage $version"

   geocode
       Takes a single named parameter 'location' and returns a result hashref.

           my $response = $Geocoder->geocode(location => "Mudgee, Australia");

       warns and returns undef if the query fails for some reason.

       If you will be doing forward geocoding, please see the OpenCage query
       formatting guidelines <https://opencagedata.com/guides/how-to-format-
       your-geocoding-query>

       You should check the always response status

         $response->{status}{code}

       to ensure you have had a successful response, are not hitting rate
       limits, etc.  Please see the OpenCage geocoding API response codes
       <https://opencagedata.com/api#codes>

       The OpenCage Geocoder has a few optional parameters:

       Supported Parameters
        please see the OpenCage geocoder documentation
        <https://opencagedata.com/api>. Most of the various optional
        parameters <https://opencagedata.com/api#forward-opt> are supported.
        For example:

        language
          An IETF format language code (such as es for Spanish or pt-BR for
          Brazilian Portuguese); if this is omitted a code of en (English)
          will be assumed.

        limit
          Limits the maximum number of results returned. Default is 10.

        countrycode
          Provides the geocoder with a hint to the country that the query
          resides in.  This value will help the geocoder but will not restrict
          the possible results to the supplied country.

          The country code is a comma seperated list of 2 character code as
          defined by the ISO 3166-1 Alpha 2 standard.

       Not Supported
        jsonp
          This module always parses the response as a Perl data structure, so
          the jsonp option is never used.

       As a full example:

           my $response = $Geocoder->geocode(
               location => "Псковская улица, Санкт-Петербург, Россия",
               language => "ru",
               countrycode => "ru",
           );

   reverse_geocode
       Takes two named parameters 'lat' and 'lng' and returns a result
       hashref.

           my $response = $Geocoder->reverse_geocode(lat => -22.6792, lng => 14.5272);

       This method supports the optional parameters in the same way that
       geocode() does.

ENCODING
       All strings passed to and received from Geo::Coder::OpenCage methods
       are expected to be character strings, not byte strings.

       For more information see perlunicode.
