       -w, --write
              transfer PC->15x1 (default when started as 'cbmwrite') -r and -w
              are mutually exclusive

       -h, --help
              display this help and exit

       -V, --version
              display version information and exit

       -@, --adapter=plugin:bus
              tell OpenCBM which backend plugin and bus to use

              quiet output

       -t, --transfer=TRANSFER
              set transfermode; valid modes: auto (default)

       original or o
              (slowest)

       serial1 or s1
              serial2 or s2 parallel       (fastest)

       (can be abbreviated, if unambiguous)
              `serial1' should work in any case; `serial2' won't work if more
              than one device is connected to the IEC bus; `parallel' needs a
              XP1541/XP1571 cable in addition to the serial one.  `auto' tries
              to determine the best option.

       -d, --drive-type=TYPE
              specify drive type, one of: 1541, 1570, 1571, 1581
