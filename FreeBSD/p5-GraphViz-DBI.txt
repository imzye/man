NAME
       GraphViz::DBI - Graph database tables and relations

VERSION
       version 1.100860

SYNOPSIS
         use GraphViz::DBI;
         my $dbh = DBI->connect('...', '...', '...');
         print GraphViz::DBI->new($dbh)->graph_tables->as_png;

DESCRIPTION
       This module constructs a graph for a database showing tables and
       connecting them if they are related. While or after constructing the
       object, pass an open database handle, then call "graph_tables" to
       determine database metadata and construct a GraphViz graph from the
       table and field information.

       The methods described here are defined by this class; all other method
       calls are passed to the underlying GraphViz object:

METHODS
   new([$dbh])
       Constructs the object; also creates a GraphViz object. The constructor
       accepts an optional open database handle.

   set_dbh($dbh)
       Sets the database handle.

   get_dbh()
       Returns the database handle.

   get_tables()
       Returns the tables defined in the database.

   is_table($table)
       Checks the database metadata whether the argument is a valid table
       name.

   is_foreign_key($table, $field)
       Determines whether the field belonging to the table is a foreign key
       into some other table. If so, it is expected to return the name of that
       table. If not, it is expected to return a false value.

       For example, if there is a table called "product" and another table
       contains a field called "product_id", then to indicate that this field
       is a foreign key into the product table, the method returns "product".
       This is the logic implemented in this class. You can override this
       method in a subclass to suit your needs.

   graph_tables()
       This method goes through all tables and fields and calls appropriate
       methods to determine which tables and which dependencies exist, then
       hand the results over to GraphViz. It returns the GraphViz object.

FEATURE IDEAS
       •   Test with various database drivers to see whether they support the
           metadata interface.

       •   Make each table a vertical port with dependencies using those
           ports.

       •   Provide the possibility to name edges to specify the type of
           relationship ('has-a', 'is-a', etc.).
