Module::Plan::Base(3)                      User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Module::Plan::Base - Base class for Module::Plan classes

DESCRIPTION
       Module::Plan::Base provides the underlying basic functionality. That
       is, taking a file, injecting it into CPAN, and the installing it via
       the CPAN module.

       It also provides for a basic "phase" system, that allows steps to be
       taken in the appropriate order. This is very simple for now, but may be
       upgraded later into a dependency-based system.

       This class is undocumented for the moment.

       See pip for the front-end console application for this module.

SUPPORT
       See the main pip module for support information.
