KF(1)                   FreeBSD General Commands Manual                  KF(1)

NAME
     kf – securely forward tickets

SYNOPSIS
     kf [-p port | --port=port] [-l login | --login=login] [-c ccache |
        --ccache=ccache] [-F | --forwardable] [-G | --no-forwardable]
        [-h | --help] [--version] host ...

DESCRIPTION
     The kf program forwards tickets to a remote host through an authenticated
     and encrypted stream.  Options supported are:

     -p port, --port=port
             port to connect to

     -l login, --login=login
             remote login name

     -c ccache, --ccache=ccache
             remote cred cache

     -F, --forwardable
             forward forwardable credentials

     -G, --no-forwardable
             do not forward forwardable credentials

     -h, --help

     --version

     kf is useful when you do not want to enter your password on a remote host
     but want to have your tickets one for example AFS.

     In order for kf to work you will need to acquire your initial ticket with
     forwardable flag, i.e.  kinit --forwardable.

     telnet is able to forward tickets by itself.
