NAME
       gpsman - a (graphical) manager of GPS data

SYNOPSIS
       gpsman [-dev [usb=]DEVICE]
       gpsman [OPTIONS] COMMAND [COMMAND_ARGS]

DESCRIPTION
       gpsman GPS Manager (GPSMan) is a graphical manager of GPS data that
       makes possible the preparation, inspection and edition of GPS data in a
       friendly environment. GPSMan supports communication and real-time
       logging with Garmin, Lowrance and Magellan receivers and accepts real-
       time logging information in NMEA 0183 from any GPS receiver.

       To comunicate with the GPS port the user must have been granted
       read/write permissions for the corresponding device.

       For use in graphical mode GPSMan is normally invoked in the first form
       above, where the usb= prefix to the device path enforces the use of the
       Garmin USB protocol. The use in this mode is not further described
       here, a full description being given in the User Manual available along
       with the GPSMan distribution.

       GPSMan can also be used in command line mode (with no graphical
       interface except with the readstart travel commands), in which case it
       must be invoked in the second form above. The sections below address
       this mode.

EXIT STATUS
       In non-graphical mode GPSMan exits with either a 0 if COMMAND was
       successfully executed, or a 1 if not. Some commands will write
       information to the standard output channel. Error messages can possibly
       be written to the standard error channel, but most of the errors will
       not be explained. In case of doubt the graphical mode should be used to
       see if there are problems with files or the receiver.

OPTIONS
       Apart from the -dev option all other options are only for use in non-
       graphical mode.

       -dev DEVICE gives the device path.

       -log creates a log file of the low-level communication
              under the name logfile in the GPSMan user directory.

       -rec Garmin | Lowrance | Magellan
              changes the brand of the receiver (NOTE: at present will only
              work with Garmin); this option can be useful to override the
              options in the preferences file; cannot be used with the readput
              command, nor with the -prefs option, and cannot occur after the
              -prot option.

       -prefs PREFSFILE
              gives the path for an alternative preferences file (read after
              the user preferences file); cannot be used with the -rec option.

       -prot PROTOCOL
              selects the protocol to be used for connecting to the receiver;
              cannot occur before the -rec option; the show protocols command
              can be used to find out which protocols are available.

       Options not related with COMMAND will be silently ignored.

NAME=VALUE ARGUMENTS
       Some commands accept parameters in the form NAME=VALUE. The term PARAM
       when used here referring to arguments of a command has always this
       meaning. Care should be taken if the value part is a string with spaces
       (or other characters with special meaning for the shell or system
       command interpreter) in which case quotes or some other form of quoting
       should be used.

GPSMAN COMMAND SUMMARY
       There is no room in a manual page to describe in detail the available
       commands. The following list gives a synopsis for all of them and the
       User Manual should be consulted for more information.

       is available exits with 0.

       is connected
              exits with 0 if a connection check with the receiver succeeds.

       show WHAT writes help information to the standard output; WHAT is one
       of: datums, formats (data file formats), help, projections, protocols,
       symbols (waypoint symbols), transfs (coordinates transformations).

       haslib LIBRARY checks availability of a library

       getwrite INTYPES FORMAT [OUTTYPES] [OUTPARAMS] PATH transfers data from
       the receiver to a file.

       readput FORMAT [INPARAMS] [INTYPES] PATH [OUTTYPES] transfers data from
       a file to the receiver.

       getrtimelog PATH [INTERVAL] gets the real-time log from the receiver
       and saves it to a file.

       getfix PATH [TIMEOUT] gets the current fix data from the receiver and
       saves it to a file.

       getalmanac PATH gets the current almanac data from the receiver and
       saves it to a file.

       read IN-FORMAT [PARAMS] [TYPES] PATH reads a data file and launches the
       graphical interface (in GPSMan scripts the behaviour is different; see
       the exec command in the User Manual).

       start travel [INTERVAL] launches the graphical interface and starts
       real-time logging, animation and travelling.

       translate FORMAT [INPARAMS] [INTYPES] PATH [HOWPARAMS] FORMAT
       [OUTPARAMS] [OUTTYPES] PATH translates from a file format to another.

       project LATD LONGD DATUM PROJECTION [PARAMS] writes to the standard
       output the projection of a point.

       georef IMGPATH TRANSF LATD LONGD LATD LONGD [LATD LONGD] DATUM X Y X Y
       [X Y] PROJECTION [PARAMS] writes to the standard output a map
       information file.

       geopicts FORMAT [INPARAMS] INTYPE PATH [PROCPARAMS] [FORMAT]
       [OUTPARAMS] PATH PICTPATHS geo-references files either based on their
       time-stamps and a given track, or by using the sequence of waypoints in
       a group.

       source PATH executes a Tcl/Tk script.

       exec PATH executes a GPSMan script.
