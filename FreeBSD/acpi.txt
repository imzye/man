ACPI(4)                FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                ACPI(4)

NAME
     acpi – Advanced Configuration and Power Management support

SYNOPSIS
     device acpi

     options ACPI_DEBUG
     options DDB

DESCRIPTION
     The acpi driver provides support for the Intel/Microsoft/Compaq/Toshiba
     ACPI standard.  This support includes platform hardware discovery
     (superseding the PnP and PCI BIOS), as well as power management
     (superseding APM) and other features.  ACPI core support is provided by
     the ACPI CA reference implementation from Intel.

     Note that the acpi driver is automatically loaded by the loader(8), and
     should only be compiled into the kernel on platforms where ACPI is
     mandatory.

SYSCTL VARIABLES
     The acpi driver is intended to provide power management without user
     intervention.  If the default settings are not optimal, the following
     sysctls can be used to modify or monitor acpi behavior.  Note that some
     variables will be available only if the given hardware supports them
     (such as hw.acpi.acline).

     debug.acpi.enable_debug_objects
             Enable dumping Debug objects without options ACPI_DEBUG.  Default
             is 0, ignore Debug objects.

     dev.cpu.N.cx_usage
             Debugging information listing the percent of total usage for each
             sleep state.  The values are reset when dev.cpu.N.cx_lowest is
             modified.

     dev.cpu.N.cx_lowest
             Lowest Cx state to use for idling the CPU.  A scheduling
             algorithm will select states between C1 and this setting as
             system load dictates.  To enable ACPI CPU idling control,
             machdep.idle should be set to acpi if it is listed in
             machdep.idle_available.

     dev.cpu.N.cx_supported
             List of supported CPU idle states and their transition latency in
             microseconds.  Each state has a type (e.g., C2).  C1 is
             equivalent to the ia32 HLT instruction, C2 provides a deeper
             sleep with the same semantics, and C3 provides the deepest sleep
             but additionally requires bus mastering to be disabled.  States
             greater than C3 provide even more power savings with the same
             semantics as the C3 state.  Deeper sleeps provide more power
             savings but increased transition latency when an interrupt
             occurs.

     dev.cpu.N.cx_method
             List of supported CPU idle states and their transition methods,
             as directed by the firmware.

     hw.acpi.acline
             AC line state (1 means online, 0 means on battery power).

     hw.acpi.disable_on_reboot
             Disable ACPI during the reboot process.  Most systems reboot fine
             with ACPI still enabled, but some require exiting to legacy mode
             first.  Default is 0, leave ACPI enabled.

     hw.acpi.handle_reboot
             Use the ACPI Reset Register capability to reboot the system.
             Some newer systems require use of this register, while some only
             work with legacy rebooting support.

     hw.acpi.lid_switch_state
             Suspend state (S1–S5) to enter when the lid switch (i.e., a
             notebook screen) is closed.  Default is “NONE” (do nothing).

     hw.acpi.power_button_state
             Suspend state (S1–S5) to enter when the power button is pressed.
             Default is S5 (power-off nicely).

     hw.acpi.reset_video
             Reset the video adapter from real mode during the resume path.
             Some systems need this help, others have display problems if it
             is enabled.  Default is 0 (disabled).

     hw.acpi.s4bios
             Indicate whether the system supports S4BIOS.  This means that the
             BIOS can handle all the functions of suspending the system to
             disk.  Otherwise, the OS is responsible for suspending to disk
             (S4OS).  Most current systems do not support S4BIOS.

     hw.acpi.sleep_button_state
             Suspend state (S1–S5) to enter when the sleep button is pressed.
             This is usually a special function button on the keyboard.
             Default is S3 (suspend-to-RAM).

     hw.acpi.sleep_delay
             Wait this number of seconds between preparing the system to
             suspend and actually entering the suspend state.  Default is 1
             second.

     hw.acpi.supported_sleep_state
             Suspend states (S1–S5) supported by the BIOS.

             S1      Quick suspend to RAM.  The CPU enters a lower power
                     state, but most peripherals are left running.

             S2      Lower power state than S1, but with the same basic
                     characteristics.  Not supported by many systems.

             S3      Suspend to RAM.  Most devices are powered off, and the
                     system stops running except for memory refresh.

             S4      Suspend to disk.  All devices are powered off, and the
                     system stops running.  When resuming, the system starts
                     as if from a cold power on.  Not yet supported by FreeBSD
                     unless S4BIOS is available.

             S5      System shuts down cleanly and powers off.

     hw.acpi.verbose
             Enable verbose printing from the various ACPI subsystems.

LOADER TUNABLES
     Tunables can be set at the loader(8) prompt before booting the kernel or
     stored in /boot/loader.conf.  Many of these tunables also have a matching
     sysctl(8) entry for access after boot.

     acpi_dsdt_load
             Enables loading of a custom ACPI DSDT.

     acpi_dsdt_name
             Name of the DSDT table to load, if loading is enabled.

     debug.acpi.disabled
             Selectively disables portions of ACPI for debugging purposes.

     debug.acpi.interpreter_slack
             Enable less strict ACPI implementations.  Default is 1, ignore
             common BIOS mistakes.

     debug.acpi.max_threads
             Specify the number of task threads that are started on boot.
             Limiting this to 1 may help work around various BIOSes that
             cannot handle parallel requests.  The default value is 3.

     debug.acpi.quirks
             Override any automatic quirks completely.

     debug.acpi.resume_beep
             Beep the PC speaker on resume.  This can help diagnose
             suspend/resume problems.  Default is 0 (disabled).

     hint.acpi.0.disabled
             Set this to 1 to disable all of ACPI.  If ACPI has been disabled
             on your system due to a blacklist entry for your BIOS, you can
             set this to 0 to re-enable ACPI for testing.

     hw.acpi.ec.poll_timeout
             Delay in milliseconds to wait for the EC to respond.  Try
             increasing this number if you get the error
             "AE_NO_HARDWARE_RESPONSE".

     hw.acpi.host_mem_start
             Override the assumed memory starting address for PCI host
             bridges.

     hw.acpi.install_interface, hw.acpi.remove_interface
             Install or remove OS interface(s) to control return value of
             ‘_OSI’ query method.  When an OS interface is specified in
             hw.acpi.install_interface, _OSI query for the interface returns
             it is supported.  Conversely, when an OS interface is specified
             in hw.acpi.remove_interface, _OSI query returns it is not
             supported.  Multiple interfaces can be specified in a comma-
             separated list and any leading white spaces will be ignored.  For
             example, "FreeBSD, Linux" is a valid list of two interfaces
             "FreeBSD" and "Linux".

     hw.acpi.reset_video
             Enables calling the VESA reset BIOS vector on the resume path.
             This can fix some graphics cards that have problems such as LCD
             white-out after resume.  Default is 0 (disabled).

     hw.acpi.serialize_methods
             Allow override of whether methods execute in parallel or not.
             Enable this for serial behavior, which fixes "AE_ALREADY_EXISTS"
             errors for AML that really cannot handle parallel method
             execution.  It is off by default since this breaks recursive
             methods and some IBMs use such code.

     hw.acpi.verbose
             Turn on verbose debugging information about what ACPI is doing.

     hw.pci.link.%s.%d.irq
             Override the interrupt to use for this link and index.  This
             capability should be used carefully, and only if a device is not
             working with acpi enabled.  "%s" is the name of the link (e.g.,
             LNKA).  "%d" is the resource index when the link supports
             multiple IRQs.  Most PCI links only have one IRQ resource, so the
             below form should be used.

     hw.pci.link.%s.irq
             Override the interrupt to use.  This capability should be used
             carefully, and only if a device is not working with acpi enabled.
             "%s" is the name of the link (e.g., LNKA).

DISABLING ACPI
     Since ACPI support on different platforms varies greatly, there are many
     debugging and tuning options available.

     For machines known not to work with acpi enabled, there is a BIOS
     blacklist.  Currently, the blacklist only controls whether acpi should be
     disabled or not.  In the future, it will have more granularity to control
     features (the infrastructure for that is already there).

     To enable acpi (for debugging purposes, etc.) on machines that are on the
     blacklist, set the kernel environment variable hint.acpi.0.disabled to 0.
     Before trying this, consider updating your BIOS to a more recent version
     that may be compatible with ACPI.

     To disable the acpi driver completely, set the kernel environment
     variable hint.acpi.0.disabled to 1.

     Some i386 machines totally fail to operate with some or all of ACPI
     disabled.  Other i386 machines fail with ACPI enabled.  Disabling all or
     part of ACPI on non-i386 platforms (i.e., platforms where ACPI support is
     mandatory) may result in a non-functional system.

     The acpi driver comprises a set of drivers, which may be selectively
     disabled in case of problems.  To disable a sub-driver, list it in the
     kernel environment variable debug.acpi.disabled.  Multiple entries can be
     listed, separated by a space.

     ACPI sub-devices and features that can be disabled:

     all              Disable all ACPI features and devices.

     acad             (device) Supports AC adapter.

     bus              (feature) Probes and attaches subdevices.  Disabling
                      will avoid scanning the ACPI namespace entirely.

     children         (feature) Attaches standard ACPI sub-drivers and devices
                      enumerated in the ACPI namespace.  Disabling this has a
                      similar effect to disabling “bus”, except that the ACPI
                      namespace will still be scanned.

     button           (device) Supports ACPI button devices (typically power
                      and sleep buttons).

     cmbat            (device) Control-method batteries device.

     cpu              (device) Supports CPU power-saving and speed-setting
                      functions.

     ec               (device) Supports the ACPI Embedded Controller
                      interface, used to communicate with embedded platform
                      controllers.

     isa              (device) Supports an ISA bus bridge defined in the ACPI
                      namespace, typically as a child of a PCI bus.

     lid              (device) Supports an ACPI laptop lid switch, which
                      typically puts a system to sleep.

     mwait            (feature) Do not ask firmware for available x86-vendor
                      specific methods to enter Cx sleep states.  Only query
                      and use the generic I/O-based entrance method.  The knob
                      is provided to work around inconsistencies in the tables
                      filled by firmware.

     quirks           (feature) Do not honor quirks.  Quirks automatically
                      disable ACPI functionality based on the XSDT table's OEM
                      vendor name and revision date.

     pci              (device) Supports Host to PCI bridges.

     pci_link         (feature) Performs PCI interrupt routing.

     sysresource      (device) Pseudo-devices containing resources which ACPI
                      claims.

     thermal          (device) Supports system cooling and heat management.

     timer            (device) Implements a timecounter using the ACPI fixed-
                      frequency timer.

     video            (device) Supports acpi_video(4) which may conflict with
                      agp(4) device.

     It is also possible to avoid portions of the ACPI namespace which may be
     causing problems, by listing the full path of the root of the region to
     be avoided in the kernel environment variable debug.acpi.avoid.  The
     object and all of its children will be ignored during the bus/children
     scan of the namespace.  The ACPI CA code will still know about the
     avoided region.

DEBUGGING OUTPUT
     To enable debugging output, acpi must be compiled with options
     ACPI_DEBUG.  Debugging output is separated between layers and levels,
     where a layer is a component of the ACPI subsystem, and a level is a
     particular kind of debugging output.

     Both layers and levels are specified as a whitespace-separated list of
     tokens, with layers listed in debug.acpi.layer and levels in
     debug.acpi.level.

     The first set of layers is for ACPI-CA components, and the second is for
     FreeBSD drivers.  The ACPI-CA layer descriptions include the prefix for
     the files they refer to.  The supported layers are:

     ACPI_UTILITIES            Utility ("ut") functions
     ACPI_HARDWARE             Hardware access ("hw")
     ACPI_EVENTS               Event and GPE ("ev")
     ACPI_TABLES               Table access ("tb")
     ACPI_NAMESPACE            Namespace evaluation ("ns")
     ACPI_PARSER               AML parser ("ps")
     ACPI_DISPATCHER           Internal representation of interpreter state
                               ("ds")
     ACPI_EXECUTER             Execute AML methods ("ex")
     ACPI_RESOURCES            Resource parsing ("rs")
     ACPI_CA_DEBUGGER          Debugger implementation ("db", "dm")
     ACPI_OS_SERVICES          Usermode support routines ("os")
     ACPI_CA_DISASSEMBLER      Disassembler implementation (unused)
     ACPI_ALL_COMPONENTS       All the above ACPI-CA components
     ACPI_AC_ADAPTER           AC adapter driver
     ACPI_BATTERY              Control-method battery driver
     ACPI_BUS                  ACPI, ISA, and PCI bus drivers
     ACPI_BUTTON               Power and sleep button driver
     ACPI_EC                   Embedded controller driver
     ACPI_FAN                  Fan driver
     ACPI_OEM                  Platform-specific driver for hotkeys, LED, etc.
     ACPI_POWER                Power resource driver
     ACPI_PROCESSOR            CPU driver
     ACPI_THERMAL              Thermal zone driver
     ACPI_TIMER                Timer driver
     ACPI_ALL_DRIVERS          All the above FreeBSD ACPI drivers

     The supported levels are:

     ACPI_LV_INIT                 Initialization progress
     ACPI_LV_DEBUG_OBJECT         Stores to objects
     ACPI_LV_INFO                 General information and progress
     ACPI_LV_REPAIR               Repair a common problem with predefined
                                  methods
     ACPI_LV_ALL_EXCEPTIONS       All the previous levels
     ACPI_LV_PARSE
     ACPI_LV_DISPATCH
     ACPI_LV_EXEC
     ACPI_LV_NAMES
     ACPI_LV_OPREGION
     ACPI_LV_BFIELD
     ACPI_LV_TABLES
     ACPI_LV_VALUES
     ACPI_LV_OBJECTS
     ACPI_LV_RESOURCES
     ACPI_LV_USER_REQUESTS
     ACPI_LV_PACKAGE
     ACPI_LV_VERBOSITY1           All the previous levels
     ACPI_LV_ALLOCATIONS
     ACPI_LV_FUNCTIONS
     ACPI_LV_OPTIMIZATIONS
     ACPI_LV_VERBOSITY2           All the previous levels
     ACPI_LV_ALL                  Synonym for "ACPI_LV_VERBOSITY2"
     ACPI_LV_MUTEX
     ACPI_LV_THREADS
     ACPI_LV_IO
     ACPI_LV_INTERRUPTS
     ACPI_LV_VERBOSITY3           All the previous levels
     ACPI_LV_AML_DISASSEMBLE
     ACPI_LV_VERBOSE_INFO
     ACPI_LV_FULL_TABLES
     ACPI_LV_EVENTS
     ACPI_LV_VERBOSE              All levels after "ACPI_LV_VERBOSITY3"
     ACPI_LV_INIT_NAMES
     ACPI_LV_LOAD

     Selection of the appropriate layer and level values is important to avoid
     massive amounts of debugging output.  For example, the following
     configuration is a good way to gather initial information.  It enables
     debug output for both ACPI-CA and the acpi driver, printing basic
     information about errors, warnings, and progress.

           debug.acpi.layer="ACPI_ALL_COMPONENTS ACPI_ALL_DRIVERS"
           debug.acpi.level="ACPI_LV_ALL_EXCEPTIONS"

     Debugging output by the ACPI CA subsystem is prefixed with the module
     name in lowercase, followed by a source line number.  Output from the
     FreeBSD-local code follows the same format, but the module name is
     uppercased.

OVERRIDING YOUR BIOS BYTECODE
     ACPI interprets bytecode named AML (ACPI Machine Language) provided by
     the BIOS vendor as a memory image at boot time.  Sometimes, the AML code
     contains a bug that does not appear when parsed by the Microsoft
     implementation.  FreeBSD provides a way to override it with your own AML
     code to work around or debug such problems.  Note that all AML in your
     DSDT and any SSDT tables is overridden.

     In order to load your AML code, you must edit /boot/loader.conf and
     include the following lines.

           acpi_dsdt_load="YES"
           acpi_dsdt_name="/boot/acpi_dsdt.aml" # You may change this name.

     In order to prepare your AML code, you will need the acpidump(8) and
     iasl(8) utilities and some ACPI knowledge.

COMPATIBILITY
     ACPI is only found and supported on i386/ia32 and amd64.

BUGS
     Many BIOS versions have serious bugs that may cause system instability,
     break suspend/resume, or prevent devices from operating properly due to
     IRQ routing problems.  Upgrade your BIOS to the latest version available
     from the vendor before deciding it is a problem with acpi.
