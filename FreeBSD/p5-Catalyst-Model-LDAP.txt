NAME
       Catalyst::Helper::Model::LDAP - Helper for LDAP models

VERSION
       version 0.21

SYNOPSIS
           script/myapp_create.pl model Person LDAP ldap.ufl.edu ou=People,dc=ufl,dc=edu dn=admin,dc=ufl,dc=edu mypass 1

DESCRIPTION
       Helper for the Catalyst LDAP model.

USAGE
       When creating a new LDAP model class using this helper, you can specify
       much of the configuration and have it filled automatically.  Using the
       example from the "SYNOPSIS" section:

       •   "Person"

           The name of the model.  This is also used to determine the
           filename, e.g. "lib/MyApp/Model/Person.pm".

       •   "LDAP"

           The helper to use, i.e. this one.

       •   "ldap.ufl.edu"

           The LDAP server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN).  Can also be
           an IP address, e.g. 127.0.0.1.

       •   "ou=People,dc=ufl,dc=edu"

           The base distinguished name (DN) for searching the directory.

       •   "dn=admin,dc=ufl,dc=edu"

           The bind DN for connecting to the directory.  This can be anyone
           that has permission to search under the base DN, as per your LDAP
           server's access control lists.

       •   "mypass"

           The password for the specified bind DN.

       •   1

           Optionally uses TLS when binding to the LDAP server, for secure
           connections.

METHODS
   mk_compclass
       Makes the LDAP model class.

   mk_comptest
       Makes tests for the LDAP model.
