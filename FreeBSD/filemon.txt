FILEMON(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             FILEMON(1)

NAME
     filemon – log child process file access using filemon

SYNOPSIS
     filemon [-f trfile] command

DESCRIPTION
     The filemon utility is a simple wrapper around the filemon(4) kernel
     facility (see that manual page for the file format).  Unlike ktrace(1)
     the trace file can be a named pipe.  The options are:

     -f trfile
             Log trace records to trfile instead of filemon.out.

SEE ALSO
     ktrace(1), filemon(4)

AUTHORS
     The filemon utility was written by Daniel O'Connor.
