CURSIVE(6)                   FreeBSD Games Manual                   CURSIVE(6)

NAME
       cursive - print text in cursive script

SYNOPSIS
       cursive [ -in ] [ -tn ] [message]

DESCRIPTION
       Cursive prints a line of text in a rather crude cursive script.  It is
       intended for use mainly for the generation of decorative signatures for
       electronic mail.  If message text is given on the command line, that
       text is used.  Otherwise the text will be read from standard input up
       to an end of file.  The -i option sets the minimum spacing between
       adjacent characters.  The default is -i1 .  The -t option sets the
       length of the trailing lines on the end of each word.  The default is
       -t1 .

       The '_' character is treated in a special way.  It may be inserted in
       the text anywhere you wish to lengthen a connecting line between two
       letters.

BUGS
       Many ASCII characters are not defined, notably the numbers and symbols.
       Punctuation is mostly available.  Some characters are rather ugly.  The
       author has lousy handwriting.
