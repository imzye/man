Algorithm::BinPack(3)                      User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Algorithm::BinPack - efficiently pack items into bins

SYNOPSIS
       "Algorithm::BinPack" efficiently packs items into bins. The bins are
       given a maximum size, and items are packed in with as little empty
       space as possible. An example use would be backing up files to CD,
       while minimizing the number of discs required.

           my $bp = Algorithm::BinPack->new(binsize => 4);

           $bp->add_item(label => "one",   size => 1);
           $bp->add_item(label => "two",   size => 2);
           $bp->add_item(label => "three", size => 3);
           $bp->add_item(label => "four",  size => 4);

           for ($bp->pack_bins) {
               print "Bin size: ", $_->{size},  "\n";
               print "  Item: ",   $_->{label}, "\n" for @{ $_->{items} };
           }

METHODS
       new     Creates a new "Algorithm::BinPack" object. The maximum bin size
               is specified as a named argument 'binsize', and is required. A
               fudge factor may be specified as a named argument 'fudge'. If a
               fudge factor is specified, item sizes will be rounded up to a
               number divisible by the fudge factor. This can help keep items
               with similar sizes in order by their labels.

                   my $bp = Algorithm::BinPack->new(binsize => 4);
                   my $bp = Algorithm::BinPack->new(binsize => 100, fudge => 10);

       add_item
               Adds an item to be packed into a bin. Required named arguments
               are 'label' and 'size', but any others can be specified, and
               will be saved.  An optional 'bin' argument can be used to
               manually put an item into the specified bin.

                   $bp->add_item(label => 'one',  size => 1);
                   $bp->add_item(label => 'two',  size => 2, desc => 'The second numeral');
                   $bp->add_item(label => 'zero', size => 3, bin => 0);
                   $bp->add_item(qw(label three size 3));
                   $bp->add_item(qw(label four size 4 random key));

       prefill_bin
               (Deprecated method) "add_item" now knows how to handle the
               'bin' argument directly, so this method is redundant.

       pack_bins
               Packs the items into bins. This method tries to leave as little
               empty space in each bin as possible. It returns a list of
               hashrefs with the key 'size' containing the total bin size, and
               'items' containing an arrayref holding the items in the bin.
               Each item is in turn a hashref containing the keys 'label',
               'size', and any others added to the item.  If a fudge factor
               was used, each item will contain a key 'fudgesize', which is
               the size this item was fudged to.

                   for my $bin ($bp->pack_bins) {
                       print "Bin size: ", $bin->{size}, "\n";

                       for my $item (@{ $bin->{items} }) {
                           printf "  %-6s %-20s\n", $_, $item->{$_} for keys %{ $item };
                           print  "  ---\n";
                       }
                   }

SEE ALSO
       This module implements the bin packing algorithm described in 'The
       Algorithm Design Manual' by Steven S. Skiena.

       This module is similar to Algorithm::Bucketizer, but has a few key
       differences. The algorithms in Algorithm::Bucketizer are based on
       optimization by multiple iterations, so the module is set up
       differently. By contrast, the algorithm used in Algorithm::BinPack is
       predictable, and does not require multiple iterations. The name also
       reflects the well-known name of the problem. Searching for variations
       on "bin packing" finds more relevant results than variations on
       "bucketizer".
