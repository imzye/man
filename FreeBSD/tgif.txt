NAME
       tgif - Xlib based interactive 2-D drawing facility under X11.  Supports
       hierarchical construction of drawings and easy navigation between sets
       of drawings.  It's also a hyper-graphics (or hyper-structured-graphics)
       browser on the World-Wide-Web.

DESCRIPTION
       Tgif is an interactive drawing tool that allows the user to draw and
       manipulate objects in the X Window System.  Tgif runs interactively in
       the first form.  In the second form shown in the SYNOPSIS section, tgif
       just prints file1.obj, file2.obj, etc.  (generated by tgif) into
       PostScript(TM) page description files (without opening windows or
       fonts) and pipes them to lpr(1) if none of the -eps, -p, -epsi,
       -tiffepsi, -gif, -png, -jpeg, -ppm, -pbm, -xpm, -xbm, -html, -pdf, -ps,
       -f, -text, -netlist, or -svg options are specified.  This form of
       printing is tgif's way of exporting a tgif file to another format.  In
       this case, any other unrecognized command line options are sent to
       lpr(1).  In this mode, tgif is compatible with the obsoleted prtgif.  A
       symbol file (see descriptions below) can also be printed by specifying
       the .sym extension explicitly.

       The command line argument file specifies a file or an Uniform Resource
       Locator (URL) of objects to be initially edited by tgif.  Only HTTP or
       FTP URL's are supported.  (For a more detailed description of URL and
       the World-Wide-Web, the reader is referred to [1].)

       Tgif is purely based on Xlib.  It is tested under X11R6, and it
       requires a 3 button mouse.

OPTIONS
       In the first form shown in the SYNOPSIS section, the command line
       arguments can be:

       -fg    Foreground color specified in <color>.

       -bg    Background color specified in <color>.

       -bd    Border color specified in <color>.

       -rv    Start tgif in reversed-video mode.

       -nv    Start tgif in normal-video mode.

       -bw    Start tgif in black and white mode.

       -reqcolor
              Same effect as setting the Tgif.PrintUsingRequestedColor X
              default to true (see the X DEFAULTS section below).

       -cwo   Canvas Window Only.  Only the canvas window (see TGIF SUBWINDOWS
              section below) will be displayed.  This has the same effect as
              setting the Tgif.CanvasWindowOnly X default to true.

       -cwo+sbwarp
              If -cwo+sbwarp is used, single-button-warp (clicking the left
              mouse button to warp) is used to activate teleporting (see
              TELEPORT/HYPERJUMP section below).

       -hyper Start tgif in the hyperspace mode (see HYPERSPACE section
              below).

       -exec <file>
              After tgif starts, execute the internal command in <file> (see
              INTERNAL COMMANDS section below).  If <file> is the string "-",
              tgif executes internal commands from the standard input.

       -dbim method
              Use method as the input method for double-byte fonts (see SQUARE
              DOUBLE BYTE FONTS section below).  This cannot be used in
              conjunction with -sbim.

       -sbim method
              Use method as the input method for single-byte fonts.  This is
              useful if the X Keyboard Extension is used in inputing
              international characters (with dead keys).  This cannot be used
              in conjunction with -dbim.

       -usexlib
              If tgif is compiled with -DUSE_XT_INITIALIZE, X Toolkit
              initialization routines will be used to setup tgif.  Using this
              command line option will force tgif to ignore the
              -DUSE_XT_INITIALIZE compiler option and use Xlib only.  This is
              useful when the system resource file for tgif is not installed
              properly or messed up and needs to be bypassed.

       -a4    Using this option has the same effect as setting the
              Tgif.PSA4PaperSize X default to true.

       -letter
              Using this option has the same effect as setting the
              Tgif.InitialPaperSize X default to "letter"

       -noshowpageineps
              Using this option has the same effect as setting the
              Tgif.ShowPageInEPS X default to false.

       -quiet If this option is used, tgif will suppress standard messages.

       -listdontreencode=<string>
              If this option is used, tgif will print out the list of
              PostScript font names specified in the -D_DONT_REENCODE compiler
              option used in compiling tgif.

       In the second form shown in the SYNOPSIS section, the command line
       arguments can be:

       -version
              If this option is used, tgif will print out its version number
              and copyright on the command line.

       -justversion
              If this option is used, tgif will print out its version number
              and copyright on the command line and exits immediately.

       -nomode
              Using this option has the same effect as setting the
              Tgif.NoModeWindow X default to true.

       -eps (or -p)
              Generates an Encapsulated PostScript(TM) file in file.eps; this
              file can be included in a LaTeX file through the \psfig, \epsf,
              or \psfile construct (see the LATEX FIGURE FORMATS section
              below).

       -ps (or -f)
              Generates a PostScript file in file.ps; this file can be printed
              to a PostScript printer with lpr(1).

       -text  Generates a text file in file.txt; the text file contains all
              visible text and can be fed to a spell checker.

       -epsi  Generates an Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) file with a preview
              bitmap in file.eps.  Tgif aborts if a valid display is not
              accessible.

       -tiffepsi
              Generates an EPS file with a DOS EPS Binary File Header and a
              trailing TIFF image in file.eps.  See the GENERATING MICROSOFT
              WINDOWS EPSI FILES section for more details.  Tgif aborts if a
              valid display is not accessible.

       -gif   Generates a GIF file in file.gif.  Please see the notes for
              Tgif.GifToXpm in the X DEFAULTS section below.  Tgif aborts if a
              valid display is not accessible.

       -png   Generates a PNG file in file.png.  Tgif aborts if a valid
              display is not accessible.

       -jpeg  Generates a JPEG file in file.jpg.  Tgif aborts if a valid
              display is not accessible.

       -ppm   Generates a PPM file in file.ppm.  Tgif aborts if a valid
              display is not accessible.

       -pbm   Generates a PBM file in file.pbm.  Tgif aborts if a valid
              display is not accessible.

       -xpm   Generates an X11 pixmap (XPM) file in file.xpm.  Tgif aborts if
              a valid display is not accessible.

       -xbm   Generates an X11 bitmap (XBM) file in file.xbm.  Tgif aborts if
              a valid display is not accessible.

       -html  Generates a GIF file in file.gif and an HTML file in file.html.
              Tgif aborts if a valid display is not accessible.

       -pdf   Generates a PDF file in file.pdf.  Please see the notes for
              Tgif.PsToPdf in the X DEFAULTS section below.

       -netlist
              Generates a text file in file.net and a text file in file.cmp.
              file.net contains netlist information stored in a table.  The
              first line in it contains column names and each line in it is a
              port name (surrounded by double-quotes), followed by a comma and
              a <TAB> character, followed by a signal name (also surrounded by
              double-quotes).  file.cmp contains information about components
              in the file.  Each component begins with its name followed by
              its type.  The attributes of a component are printed afterwards
              (indented by <TAB> characters).

       -svg   Generates an SVG file in file.svg.  Please see the notes for
              Tgif.EpsToTmpSvg and Tgif.TmpSvgToSvg in the X DEFAULTS section
              below.

       -stdout
              Sends the output to the standard output instead of generating
              the output in a file.

       -raw   Causes the content of the files to be dumped to stdout.

       -raw+h If -raw+h is used and if the file is an HTTP URL, the HTTP
              header is also dumped to stdout.

       -raw+headeronly
              If -raw+headeronly is used and if the file is an HTTP URL, the
              HTTP header is dumped to stdout.

       -dosepsfilter
              Makes tgif act as a filter for getting rid of the DOS EPS Binary
              File Header and the trailing TIFF image in a DOS/Windows EPS
              file.

       -previewonly
              If -dosepsfilter is specified, -previewonly makes tgif act as a
              filter for extracting the preview bitmap from the trailing TIFF
              image in a DOS/Windows EPS file.

       -status
              If this option is used in conjunction with either -raw, -raw+h,
              or -raw+headeronly causes a status line to be displayed in
              stderr.

       -gray  Using this option has the same effect as setting the
              Tgif.UseGrayScale X default to true (see the X DEFAULTS section
              below).

       -color (or -reqcolor)
              To print in color, one can use either the -color or the
              -reqcolor option.  The only difference between the two is that
              using -reqcolor has the same effect as setting the
              Tgif.PrintUsingRequestedColor X default to true (see the X
              DEFAULTS section below).

       -adobe (or -adobe=<number>/<number> -adobe=false)
              Using this option has the same effect as specifying the
              Tgif.UsePsAdobeString X default.

       -dontreencode=<string>
              Using this option has the same effect as specifying the
              Tgif.DontReencode X default.

       -producedby=<string>
              Using this option has the same effect as specifying the
              Tgif.ProducedBy X default.

       -page  Causes a specified page (specified by <number>) to be printed.

       -print_cmd
              Using this option has the same effect as specifying the
              Tgif.PrintCommand X default.

       -one_file_per_page
              Causes each page to be printed into a separate file.

       -pepsc Preserve EPS Comment.  This command line option became obsolete
              since EPS comments are always preserved starting from
              tgif-4.0.11.

       -nolandpdfspd
              This commandline option became obsolete in tgif-4.1.42.  It is
              interpreted as -nopdfspd.

       -pdfspd (or -pdfspd=true -pdfspd=false)
              If -pdfspd or -pdfspd=true is specified, "setpagedevice" is
              generated in the interim PostScript file when exporting PDF
              files or in the final PostScript file when exporting PS files.
              If -pdfspd=false is specified, no "setpagedevice" will be
              generated in the interim PostScript file when exporting PDF
              files or in the final PostScript file when exporting PS files.
              This option overrides the Tgif.PdfSetPageDevice X default.

       -pssetup
              Using these options have the same effect as specifying the
              Tgif.AdditionalPSSetup X default.

       -tgwb2 This commandline option enables the Tangram Whiteboard feature
              in tgif.  It requires librmcast.so (Reliable IP-multicast
              library).  The location of the rmcast library can be specified
              by the optional commandline argument -rmcastlibdir.
              Alternatively, the full path to the rmcast library can be
              specified by using the optional commandline argument
              -rmcastlibpath.  (Please note that the rmcast library has only
              been extensively tested on Linux machines.)

       -j2p6_cmd
              Using this option has the same effect as specifying the
              Tgif.JpegToPpm6 X default.

       -dontcondense
              Using this option has the same effect as setting the
              Tgif.DontCondensePSFile X default to true.

       -condensed
              Using this option has the same effect as setting the
              Tgif.DontCondensePSFile X default to false.

       -bop_hook and -eop_hook
              Using these options have the same effect as specifying the
              Tgif.PSBopHook and Tgif.PSEpsHook X defaults.

       -tmp_file_mode
              Using this option have the same effect as specifying the
              Tgif.TmpFileMode X defaults.

       -patterndir
              Using this option have the same effect as specifying the
              Tgif.CustomPatternDir X defaults.

       -o     If this option is not specified, the output file (eps, ps, etc.)
              goes into the same directory as the input file.  If -o<dir> is
              specified, the output file goes into the directory specified by
              <dir>.

       -merge file1 file2 ...
              Using this option merges file1.obj, file2.obj, etc.  into a
              multipage file.

BASIC FUNCTIONALITIES
       Primitive objects supported by tgif are rectangles, ovals, rounded-
       corner rectangles, arcs, polylines, polygons, open-splines, closed-
       splines, text, X11 bitmaps, some specific forms of X11 pixmaps, and
       Encapsulated PostScript.  (Please note that the splines tgif draw are
       not Bezier curves.)  Objects can be grouped together to form a grouped
       object.  A primitive or a grouped object can be made into an icon
       object or a symbol object through user commands.

       Tgif objects are stored in two types of files.  A file with a .obj
       extension (referred to as an object file) is a file of objects, and a
       file with a .sym extension (referred to as a symbol file) specifies a
       ``building-block'' object.  A teleport mechanism is provided to travel
       (or hyperjump) among the .obj files.  A building-block object consists
       of the representation part and the definition part (which can be empty)
       of the object.  Tgif supports the ``bottom-up'' construction of
       hierarchical drawings by providing the capability to ``instantiate'' a
       building-block object in a drawing.  Tgif also supports the ``top-
       down'' specification of drawings by allowing the user to make any
       object a representation of an un-specified subsystem.  Both types of
       files are stored in the form of Prolog facts.  Prolog code can be
       written to interpret the drawings!  (It is left to the user to produce
       the code.  See the PROLOG/C TESTDRIVE section for more details.)
       Prolog engines are referred to as drivers in the sections to follow.
       (Other types of drivers are also allowed, e.g., written in C.)

       Text based attributes can be attached to any non-text object.
       Attributes specified in the representation part of a building-block
       object are non-detachable when such an object is instantiated.  See the
       ATTRIBUTES section for details.

       Tgif can generate output in a few different formats.  By default, the
       output is in the PostScript format (color PostScript is supported), and
       it is generated into a file named /tmp/Tgifa* (produced by mktemp()
       calls) where * is a number; this file is piped to lpr(1).  This takes
       place when the laser-printer icon is displayed in the Choice Window
       (see the TGIF SUBWINDOWS section for the naming of tgif windows).  This
       output can be redirected to a file with a .ps extension.  This takes
       place when the PS icon is displayed in the Choice Window.  When the PDF
       icon is displayed in the Choice Window, the output is generated into a
       file with a .pdf extension.  By default, tgif calls ps2pdf(1) from the
       ghostscript(1) package to convert a PS file to a PDF file.  When the
       LaTeX (or EPSI) icon is displayed in the Choice Window, the output is
       generated into a file with a .eps extension.  This file is in the
       Encapsulated PostScript (or Encapsulated PostScript Interchange)
       format; it can be included in a LaTeX document with the \psfig or the
       \epsf construct; this will be discussed later.  The only difference
       between the EPS and EPSI formats is that an EPSI file contains a
       preview bitmap.  However, it takes time to generate the preview bitmap.
       If the EPS/EPSI file is to be incorporated into some tool that does not
       know how to use the preview bitmap, time can be saved by not using the
       EPSI format.  When the T icon is displayed in the Choice Window, the
       output is generated into a file with a .txt extension.  This is a text
       file containing all visible text; it can be fed to a spell checker.
       When the x11bm (X11 bitmap) icon is displayed in the Choice Window and
       color output is not selected, tgif generates the output with the .xbm
       extension; the output is in the X11 bitmap format.  However, if the
       x11bm icon is displayed in the Choice Window and color output is
       selected (through the ^#k keyboard command -- ^ denotes the <Control>
       and # denotes the <Meta> or <Alt> key), then tgif generates the output
       with the .xpm extension, and the output is in the X11 pixmap format
       (the version of this XPM format depends on the settings of the
       Tgif.XPmOutputVersion X default).  When the GIF icon is displayed in
       the Choice Window, the output is generated into a file with a .gif
       extension.  By default, tgif calls xpmtoppm and ppmtogif from the
       netpbm(1) package to convert an XPM file to a GIF file.

       X11 bitmap files, certain forms of X11 pixmap files (such as the one
       generated by tgif; see the section on X11 PIXMAP for details), GIF
       files, and Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) files can be imported into
       tgif and be represented as tgif primitive objects.  Files in other
       raster formats (e.g, JPEG, TIFF, etc.) can also be imported into tgif
       if external tools can be used to convert them into X11 pixmap files.
       Please see the IMPORT RASTER GRAPHICS section for details.

       Tgif drawings are supposed to be printed on letter size paper (8.5in by
       11in).  Both landscape and portrait page styles are supported by tgif.
       Reduction (or magnification) can be controlled by the #% keyboard
       command to set the reduction/magnification.  If the compiler flag
       -DA4PAPER is defined (in Imakefile or Makefile.noimake), then the
       output is supposed to be printed on A4 papers (which has approximate
       dimensions of 8.25in by 11.7in).

GRAPHICAL OBJECTS
       An object in an object (.obj) file can be a primitive object, a grouped
       object, or an icon object.  A symbol (.sym) file can have any number of
       objects allowed in an object file and exactly one symbol object.
       (Recall that a symbol file specifies a building-block object.)  The
       symbol object in a symbol file is the representation part of the
       building-block object, and the rest of the symbol file is the
       definition part of the building-block object.  The symbol object is
       highlighted with a dashed outline to distinguish it from the rest of
       the objects.  When a building-block object is instantiated, the symbol
       part of the file is copied into the graphics editor, and it becomes the
       icon for the building-block object.

       All objects in tgif can be moved, duplicated, deleted, rotated,
       flipped, and sheared.  However, in the non-stretchable text mode, text
       objects can not be stretched.  For an text object, if it has not been
       stretched, rotated, or sheared, flipping it horizontally will cause the
       text justification to change and flipping it vertically has no effect.

       Tgif supports 32 fill patterns, 32 pen patterns, 7 default line widths,
       4 line styles (plain, head arrow, tail arrow, double arrows) for
       polylines and open-splines, 9 dash patterns, 3 types of text
       justifications, 4 text styles (roman, italic, bold, bold-italic), 11
       default text sizes (8, 10, 12, 14, 18, and 24 for the 75dpi fonts and
       11, 14, 17, 20, 25, and 34 for the 100dpi fonts), 5 default fonts
       (Times, Courier, Helvetica, New-Century-Schoolbook, Symbol), and 11
       default colors (magenta, red, green, blue, yellow, pink, cyan, cadet-
       blue, white, black, dark-slate-gray).  Additional line widths can be
       added through the use of Tgif.MaxLineWidths, Tgif.LineWidth#,
       Tgif.ArrowWidth#, and Tgif.ArrowHeight# X defaults.  Additional text
       sizes can be added through the use of Tgif.FontSizes X default.
       Additional fonts can be added through the use of Tgif.AdditionalFonts X
       default.  If the defaults fonts are not available, their replacement
       fonts can be specified by Tgif.HasAlternateDefaultFonts and related X
       defaults.  Additional colors can be added through the use of
       Tgif.MaxColors, and Tgif.Color# X defaults.  One can also select
       AddColor() or ChooseColor() from the Properties Menu to add a color.
       Alternate startup colors can be selected through the use of the
       Tgif.ColorFromXPixmap, Tgif.UseStdPalette8, Tgif.UseStdPalette27,
       Tgif.UseStdPalette64, Tgif.UseStdPalette216,
       Tgif.UseMobileWebSafePalette, Tgif.UseOpenOfficeGalaxyPalette,
       Tgif.UseOpenOfficeGooglePalette, and Tgif.AdditionalColors X defaults.

       Most commands in tgif can either be activated by a popup menu or by
       typing an appropriate non-alphanumeric key.  All operations that change
       any object can be undone and then redone.  Commands such as zoom,
       scroll, change fonts while no text objects are selected, etc. are not
       undoable.  The undo/redo history buffer size can be set using the
       Tgif.HistoryDepth X default.

TGIF SUBWINDOWS
       The tgif windows are described in this section.

       Top Window
              Displays the current domain and the name of the file tgif is
              looking at.  Mouse clicks and key presses have no effect.

       Menubar Window
              This window is right under the Top Window.  Pull-down menus can
              be activated from it with any mouse buttons.  Key presses have
              no effect.  If HideMenubar() is selected from the Layout Menu,
              this window becomes invisible.  If ShowMenubar() is selected
              from the Layout Menu (which can be activated from the Canvas
              Window below), this window becomes visible.

              The View, Text, and Graphics pull-down menus are cascading menus
              and can not be pinned (see the Popup Menus subsection below for
              a description).

       Message Window
              This is right under the Menubar Window and to the right It
              displays tgif messages.  Clicking the left mouse button in this
              window scrolls the messages towards the bottom, clicking the
              right mouse button scrolls towards the top, and clicking or
              dragging the middle mouse button scrolls to the location in the
              message history depending on where the mouse is clicked.  If the
              <Shift> (or <Control>) key is held down when clicking the
              left/right mouse button, it scrolls right/left.

       Panel (Choice) Window
              This is the window to the left of the Message Window, and it
              contains a collection of icons (not to be confused with the tgif
              icon objects) reflecting the current state of tgif.  In
              top/bottom, left/right order, it displays the current drawing
              mode, the page style (portrait or landscape), edit (see below),
              print/export mode, zoom factor, move and stretch mode
              (constrained or unconstrained), radius for rounded-corner
              rectangles, text rotation, page number or row/column, page
              layout mode (stacked or tiled), horizontal alignment (L C R S
              -), vertical alignment (T M B S -), font, text size, vertical
              spacing between lines of text within the same text object, text
              justification, shape (see below), stretchable or non-stretchable
              text mode, dash pattern, line style, polyline, spline, or
              interpolated spline, line width, fill pattern, pen pattern,
              color, and special (see below).  Key presses have no effect in
              this window.

              In addition to displaying the current state of tgif, the icons
              in the Choice Window can also be used to change the current
              state.  Each icon is associated with a particular state variable
              of tgif.  Clicking the left mouse button on top of an icon
              cycles the state variable associated with the icon forward;
              clicking the right mouse button cycles the state variable
              backwards.  Dragging the middle mouse button on top of an icon
              usually generates a popup menu which corresponds to an entry in
              the Main Menu for the Canvas Window below.  (The ``edit'',
              ``shape'',  and ``special'' icons mentioned above are dummy
              icons that allow the ``edit'', ``shape'', and ``special'' menus
              to be accessed in the Choice Window.  They do not respond to
              left and right mouse clicks.)  The response to the dragging of
              the middle mouse button is different for the zoom, radius, and
              vertical spacing icons.  Dragging the mouse left or up increases
              the zoom or decreases the radius or vertical spacing; dragging
              the mouse right or down has the opposite effect.

              If there are objects selected in the canvas window, then the
              action of the mouse will cause the selected objects to change to
              the newly selected mode; note that in this case, the current
              choice won't change if the middle mouse button is used (unless
              the Tgif.StickyMenuSelection X default is set to true).

              The settings of the horizontal and vertical alignments determine
              how objects (or vertices) align with each other when the ^l
              keyboard command is issued, how each individual object (or
              vertex) aligns with the grids when the ^t keyboard command is
              issued, how objects or vertices distribute spatially with
              respect to each other when the #l keyboard command is issued,
              and how each icon replaces the old icon when the ^#u keyboard
              command is issued.  The horizontal alignments are left (L),
              center (C), right (R), space (S), and ignore (-).  The vertical
              alignments are top (T), middle (M), bottom (B), space (S), and
              ignore (-).  In aligning operations, the space (S) and the
              ignore (-) settings have the same effect.  The space settings
              are used to distribute objects such that the gaps between any
              two neighboring objects are equal.  In vertex mode, any non-
              ignore setting will cause the selected vertices to be spaced out
              evenly.  The best way to understand them is to try them out.

              The text vertical spacing determines the vertical distance to
              advance when a carriage return is pressed during text editing.
              If the user tries to set the value too negative, such that the
              next line is exactly at the same position as the current line,
              such a setting will not be allowed (this distance depends on the
              current font and font size).

       Canvas Window
              This is the drawing area.  The effects of the actions of the
              mouse are determined by the current drawing mode.  Before
              tgif-4.x, dragging the right mouse button will generate the Mode
              Menu.  This is disabled by default in tgif-4.x, but you can turn
              it on using the Tgif.Btn3PopupModeMenu X default.

              The drawing modes are (in order, as they appear in the Mode
              Menu) select, text, rectangle, corner oval, center oval, edge
              circle, polyline (open-spline), polygon (closed-spline), arc
              (center first), arc (endpoints first), rounded-corner rectangle,
              freehand polyline (open-spline), select vertices, and
              rotate/shear.  When drawing a rectangle, an oval, or a rounded-
              corner rectangle, if the <Shift> key is held down, a square, a
              circle, or a rounded-corner square is drawn.  Dragging the
              middle mouse button will generate the Main Menu.

              In the select mode, left mouse button selects, moves, stretches,
              and reshapes objects (double-click will ``de-select'' all
              selected objects in vertex mode).  When an object is selected,
              it is highlighted by little squares (referred as handles here)
              at the corners/vertices (using the Tgif.HandleSize X default,
              the sizes of the handles can be customized).  Dragging one of
              the handles stretches/reshapes the selected object.  If one
              wants to move a selected object, one should not drag the
              handles.  Instead, one should drag other parts of the object.
              For example, if the object is a hollow rectangle (the fill is
              NONE and the pen is not NONE), in order to select the rectangle,
              one should click on the outline of the rectangle with the left
              mouse button.  If one would like to move the rectangle, one
              should drag the outline of the rectangle with the left mouse
              button.  If the object is a filled rectangle (fill is not NONE),
              one can click inside the rectangle to select it and drag
              anywhere inside the rectangle to move it.

              Holding down the <Shift> key and clicking the left mouse on an
              object which is not currently selected will add the object to
              the list of already selected objects.  The same action applied
              to an object which is already selected will cause it to be de-
              selected.  When stretching objects (not reshaping poly-type
              objects), holding down the <Shift> key after stretching is
              initiated activates proportional stretching (basically, a scale
              operation is being performed).  In non-stretchable text mode,
              text objects can not be stretched or scaled.

              Double-clicking or clicking the middle mouse button while the
              <Shift> key is held down will activate the teleport (or travel),
              the launch, or the execute internal command mechanism.  See the
              sections on TELEPORT/HYPERJUMP, LAUNCH APPLICATIONS, and
              INTERNAL COMMANDS for details.  Teleporting has precedence over
              launching, which has precedence over executing an internal
              command.  In the text drawing mode, dragging the middle mouse
              button while the <Cntrl> key is held down inside the edit text
              area will move the edit text area.

              The arrow keys can also be used to move selected objects.
              However, if no objects are selected, using the arrow keys will
              scroll the drawing area by a small amount, and using the arrow
              keys when <Control> key is held down will scroll a screen full.

              In the select vertices mode, left mouse button selects and moves
              vertices.  Only the top-level polyline/open-spline and
              polygon/closed-spline objects which are selected when the vertex
              mode is activated are eligible for vertex operations.  In this
              mode, all eligible objects have their vertices highlighted with
              squares.  When a vertex is selected (using similar mechanism as
              selecting objects described above), it is doubly highlighted
              with a '+' sign.  Operations available to these doubly
              highlighted vertices are move, delete, align (with each other),
              distribute (space them equally), and align to grid.  The arrow
              keys can also be used to move selected vertices.

              Objects can be locked (through the #< keyboard command).  Locked
              object are shown with gray handles, and they can not be moved,
              stretched, flipped, rotated, or sheared.  When objects are
              grouped, the resulting grouped object will also be locked if any
              one of it's constituents is locked.  Locked objects can have
              their properties, such as color, font, pen, etc., changed;
              furthermore, they can be deleted.

              If the current move/stretch mode is of the constrained type
              (activated and deactivated by the #@ keyboard command), top-
              level polylines will have the following behavior.  In a move
              operation, if both endpoints of a polyline lie inside the
              objects being moved, then the whole polyline is moved;
              otherwise, if only one endpoint falls inside the objects being
              moved, then that endpoint is moved.  The vertex that is the
              neighbor of the moved endpoint may also be moved either
              horizontally or vertically.  If the last line segment is
              horizontal or vertical, then the neighbor vertex may be moved so
              that the direction of the last line segment is maintained.  In a
              stretch (not reshape) operation, if an endpoint of a polyline
              lies inside the objects being moved, that endpoint will be
              moved.  The vertex that is the neighbor of the moved endpoint
              will also be moved in the same manner as described above.

              When the drawing mode is set to text (a vertical-bar cursor is
              shown), clicking the left mouse button causes selected text to
              go into edit mode.  Dragging the left mouse button or clicking
              the left mouse button while the <Shift> key is held down
              highlights substrings of the text.  Double-clicking causes a
              word to be selected.  In edit mode, key presses are treated as
              text strings being inputed, and arrow keys are used to move the
              current input position.  If a key press is preceded by an <ESC>
              key, then the character's bit 7 is turned on.  This allows non-
              ASCII (international) characters to be entered.  One can use
              xfd(1) to see what the corresponding international character is
              for an ASCII character.  For the Symbol font, symbols such as
              the integral, partial derivative, and copyright symbols can all
              be found in this range.  There are some characters that are
              supported by X11 but not by PostScript; these characters are not
              accepted by tgif.  If the text being edited is an attribute of a
              object, <Meta><Tab> will move the cursor to the next visible
              attribute and <Shift><Tab> will move the cursor to the previous
              visible attribute.

              If the drawing mode is set to draw polygons (not closed-splines)
              and if the <Shift> key is held down, the rubber-banded polygon
              will be self-closing.

              The freehand drawing mode can be used to draw polylines and open
              splines.  All intermediate points are specified by moving the
              mouse (as opposed to clicking the mouse buttons as in the
              polyline mode).  The second endpoint is specified by releasing
              the mouse button.

              In all drawing modes (other than the text mode), pressing the
              <ESC> key cancels the drawing (creation) of the current object.

              Middle mouse button always generates the main tgif popup menu.
              Holding down the <Shift> key and clicking the right mouse button
              will change the drawing mode to select.  Key presses with the
              <Control> or <Meta> key held down (referred to as non-
              alphanumeric key presses since they can also generate control
              characters) are treated as commands, and their bindings are
              summarized in the next section.  Users can also define single
              key commands to emulate the functions of the non-alphanumeric
              key commands.  The SHORTCUTS section will describe the details.

       Scrollbars
              Clicking the left mouse button in the vertical/horizontal
              scrollbar causes the canvas window to scroll down/right by a
              small distance; clicking the right mouse button has the reverse
              effect.  (The scrollbars in the popup windows for selecting file
              names and domain names behave similarly.)  Clicking with the
              <Shift> key held down will scroll a window full.  Clicking or
              dragging the middle button will cause the page to scroll to the
              location which corresponds to the gray area in the scrollbars.
              (Tgif insists that the left-top corner of the Canvas Window is
              at a distance that is a nonnegative multiple of some internal
              units from the left-top corner of the actual page.)

       Rulers
              They track the mouse location.  Mouse clicks and key presses
              have no effect.  When the page reduction/magnification is set at
              100%, the markings in the rulers correspond to centimeters when
              the metric grid system is used, and they correspond to inches
              when the English grid system is used.  When the page
              reduction/magnification is not set at 100%, the markings do not
              correspond to the above mentioned units any more (this is
              considered as a known bug).

       Interrupt/Hyperspace Window
              This window is right below the Message Window and to the left of
              the horizontal ruler.  When the Tgif.IntrCheckInterval X default
              has a positive value, an interrupt icon is visible when the
              Canvas Window is being redrawn.  If the user clicks on this
              window when the interrupt icon is visible, tgif aborts the
              repainting of the objects.  If this is done when a file is being
              opened (either through Open() or Push()), the drawing of objects
              is stopped, but the reading of the file continues (reading of
              the file is not aborted).

              If tgif is currently in the hyperspace mode (please see the
              HYPERSPACE section below for more details), a space ship icon
              will be displayed when the interrupt icon is not being
              displayed.  Clicking any button in this window will switch tgif
              in and out of the hyperspace mode.

       Page Control Window
              The Page Control Window is to the left of the horizontal
              scrollbar.  This window is empty if the current page mode is set
              to the tiled page mode.  If the current page mode is set to the
              stacked page mode, each page has a tab in tabs subwindow of this
              window.  Clicking the left mouse button on a tab goes to the
              corresponding page.  Clicking the middle mouse button brings up
              the Page Menu.  When there are too many pages in a drawing so
              that one can not see the tabs for all the pages, one can use the
              icons to the left side of the Page Control Window to scroll the
              tabs subwindow.  Clicking on the first icon scrolls the tabs
              subwindow such that the first tab is visible.  Clicking on the
              4th icon scrolls the tabs subwindow such that the last tab is
              visible.  Clicking on the 2nd icon scrolls the tabs subwindow
              towards the first tab by one tab and clicking on the 3rd icon
              scrolls the tabs subwindow towards the last tab by one tab.

       Status Window
              This window is below the horizontal scrollbar.  It shows what
              action will be taken if a mouse button is depressed.  When a
              menu is pulled down or popped up, this window shows what action
              will be taken if a menu item is selected.  It also displays
              miscellaneous status information.  Mouse clicks and key presses
              have no effect.  If HideStatus() is selected from the Layout
              Menu, this window becomes invisible.  If ShowStatus() is
              selected from the Layout Menu, this window becomes visible.

              By default, when this window is displaying mouse button status,
              right-handed mouse is assumed.  Setting the
              Tgif.ReverseMouseStatusButtons X default to true will reverse
              the status (as if a left-handed mouse is used).

       Popup Menus
              When a menu is popped up by a mouse drag, the menu can be pinned
              if it is dragged far enough horizontally (the distance is
              determined by the setting of the Tgif.MainMenuPinDistance X
              default).  Clicking the right mouse button in a pinned menu will
              cause it to disappear.  Dragging the left mouse button in a
              pinned menu will reposition the menu (except when the
              Tgif.TitledPinnedMenu X default is set to true in which case the
              left mouse button performs the same function as the middle mouse
              button).  Clicking the middle mouse button in it will activate
              the item right below the mouse.

NON-ALPHANUMERIC KEY BINDINGS
       Most operations that can be performed in tgif can be activated through
       non-alphanumeric keys (some operations can only be activated through
       popup menus or shortcut keys).  This section summarizes the operations
       that can be activated by a key stroke with the <Control> and/or the
       <Meta> key held down.  ``^'' denotes the <Control> key and ``#''
       denotes the <Meta> key in the following description.  (The ``keys.obj''
       file, distributed with tgif, also summarizes the same information, but
       it is organized differently.  This file can be viewed with tgif, and if
       installed properly, it can be found in the same directory as the
       ``tgificon.obj'' file, mentioned in the FILES section of this
       document.)

SHORTCUTS
       The user can define single character shortcut keys to emulate the
       function of the non-alphanumeric key presses to activate commands.
       This is done through the use of the Tgif.ShortCuts X default.  (Please
       note that these shortcut keys are only active when the drawing mode is
       not set to the text mode.)  The Tgif.ShortCuts consists of a list of
       items, each of which specifies the bindings between a key (may be case
       sensitive) and a command.  The items are separated by blanks, and each
       item is interpreted as follows.  It consists of two parts, KEY and
       COMMAND, which are concatenated together with a ':' character.  The
       format of the KEY part is one of :<Key>x, !<Key>x, or <Key>x (here the
       character 'x' is used as an example; furthermore, the substring <Key>
       must be spelled exactly the way it appears here).  The first 2 formats
       are equivalent, they specify the lower case x; the 3rd format specifies
       both the characters 'x' and 'X'.  The COMMAND part is a string that
       matches strings in tgif's popup menus with space characters removed
       (exceptions are noted below).  This is illustrated by the following
       example.  In the Edit menu, two of the entries are,

          "Delete     ^x"
          "SelectAll  ^a"

       which means that <Control>x activates and Delete() command, and
       <Control>a activates the SelectAll() command.  Therefore, both Delete()
       and SelectAll() are valid names for the COMMAND part of a shortcut
       specification.  To complete the example, the following line can be used
       to bind the lower case 'x' to Delete() and 'a' or 'A' to SelectAll():

          Tgif.ShortCuts:  !<Key>x:Delete() \n\
                      <Key>a:SelectAll()

       For more examples, please see the sample X defaults file,
       tgif.Xdefaults, included in the tgif distribution.

       Here is a list of exceptions where the COMMAND does not match a command
       name in a menu entry.  The left entry is a proper COMMAND name, and the
       right is a list of strings that's shown in popup menus which the
       COMMAND would correspond to.

       names (having the obvious meaning): ScrollLeft(), ScrollRight(),
       ScrollUp(), ScrollDown(), SelectMode(), DrawText(), DrawBox(),
       DrawOval(), DrawPoly(), DrawPolygon(), DrawRCBox(), DrawArc(), and
       SelectVertexMode().

COLORS AND COLORMAPS
       In most X environments, only 256 colors can be displayed at once.  In
       these environment, if an application needs 128 colors and another
       application needs a totally different 129 colors, both applications can
       not be displayed at once with all the colors they want.  X solves the
       problem by allowing applications to use their own colormaps (known as
       private colormaps).  Each private colormap can have at most 256 colors.
       There is also a shared colormap available for applications that do not
       wish to use private colormaps.  The main problem with using private
       colormaps is that a user will see the the well-known colormap flashing
       phenomenon when he/she switches in and out of applications that use
       private colormaps.

       Tgif uses the shared colormap initially.  When it needs more color than
       what is available in the shared colormap, it will use a private
       colormap automatically.  When tgif no longer needs the extra colors, it
       does not automatically revert to using the shared colormap because it
       needs to be able to undo operations that use the extra colors.  If one
       does no longer needs the objects in the undo buffer, one can select
       FlushUndoBuffer() from the Edit Menu to flush the undo buffer.  At this
       point, tgif will attempt to use the shared colormap to avoid the
       colormap flashing problem.  If one often uses XPM and GIF objects, one
       can bind the <Shift>f key to the FlushUndoBuffer() operation by setting
       the following X default and uses the <Shift>f key to regain entries in
       the colormap when an XPM/GIF object is deleted:

              Tgif.ShortCuts: !<Key>F:FlushUndoBuffer()

       Even when a private colormap is used, only 256 colors can be used at
       once.  Therefore, it is not possible to import two 256-colors GIF files
       into the same drawing unless the colors are somehow reduced to fit in
       the 256-colors colormap.  This can be done through dithering which is
       described in the IMPORT RASTER GRAPHICS section below.

IMPORT RASTER GRAPHICS
       The native raster graphics formats that tgif supports are the XBM and
       XPM formats.  In order to import color raster graphics file of another
       format, tgif can work with external tools that can convert non-XPM
       format files to an XPM files.  A popular raster format conversion
       toolkit is the pbmplus(1) (also known as the netpbm(1)) toolkit.  It
       can convert a GIF file (e.g., "foo.gif") to an XPM file (e.g.,
       "foo.xpm") with the following command (giftopnm is in netpbm; an
       earlier version of it called giftoppm exists in pbmplus):

              giftopnm foo.gif | ppmtoxpm > foo.xpm

       When working with tgif, a GIF file name will be supplied by tgif and
       the output of ppmtoxpm will be directly read by tgif through a pipe;
       therefore, the previous sequence is replaced by an X default containing
       the following form (which happens to be the default setting for the
       Tgif.GifToXpm X default):

              giftopnm %s | ppmtoxpm

       The "%s" is to be replaced by a GIF file name.  The above is referred
       to as a filter.

       To be able to import other types of raster graphics files, one can use
       Tgif.MaxImportFilters and Tgif.ImportFilter# X defaults to specify
       additional filters.  The following example adds a JPEG filter:

              Tgif.MaxImportFilters: 1
              Tgif.ImportFilter0: \n\
                      JPEG-222 jpg;jpeg \n\
                      djpeg -gif -colors 222 %s | \n\
                      giftopnm | ppmtoxpm

       The "JPEG-222" above is the name given to the filter (must not contain
       any space character).  The "jpg;jpeg" are possible file extensions
       separated by semicolons.  The rest is the filter specification.  The
       djpeg(1) program is part of the libjpeg distribution.  It can convert a
       JPEG file to a GIF file.  The above filter also restrict the output to
       have a maximum of 222 colors.  (The 222 is chosen arbitrarily.  Many
       XPM files use some ``standard'' 32 colors, so one may want to leave
       room form them.)

       To invoke a filter, one can select ImportOtherFile() or BrowseOther()
       commands from the File Menu.  This will bring up a dialogbox listing
       the available filters by their names (e.g., "JPEG-222").  After
       selecting a filter, tgif continues in a similar manner as with invoking
       ImportXPixmap() or BrowseXPixmap() commands from the File Menu.

       The above example is not suitable for the BrowseOther() command because
       only 256 colors can be used in a drawing (as explained in the COLORS
       AND COLORMAPS section above).  In order for BrowseOther() to work well,
       one can use dithering to represent an image with a dithered image that
       only uses a set of standard colors.  The example below uses ppmdither
       from the pbmplus/netpbm toolkit:

              Tgif.MaxImportFilters: 2
              Tgif.ImportFilter0: \n\
                      JPEG-222 jpg;jpeg \n\
                      djpeg -gif -colors 222 %s | \n\
                      giftopnm | ppmtoxpm
              Tgif.ImportFilter1: \n\
                      JPEG-dithered jpg;jpeg \n\
                      djpeg -gif %s | \n\
                      giftopnm | ppmdither | ppmtoxpm

       If one is working with one JPEG image, one can select ImportOtherFile()
       then select "JPEG-222" to get as many as 222 colors.  If one is
       browsing for JPEG images, one can select BrowseOther() then select
       "JPEG-dithered".

OBJECT NAMES
       If an object contains an attribute (please see the ATTRIBUTES sections
       below for details) whose name is the string "name" (case-sensitive),
       the value part of the attribute is the name of the object.  Subobject
       of a composite object can be named using a path, e.g.,
       <t>!<s1>!<s2>!..., where <t> is the name of a top-level object which
       directly contains <s1> which directly contains <s2>, etc.  !* refers to
       the currently selected object (if more than one object is selected, the
       top-most object in the stacking order is used).  !*<s1>!<s2> names the
       <s2> subobject of the <s1> subobject of the currently selected object.

       The following is not fully supported, yet (only the #<page> form is
       supported at this time).  Every object in a tgif file can be uniquely
       named using the notation #<page>!<path>, where <page> can be a string
       that specifies the name of a page or #<number> which specifies a page
       number.  The <path> is described in the previous paragraph.  If an
       object o1 is referenced by another object o2 within the same file (no
       file name or URL is specified before #) and <page> is omitted, then o1
       must be on the same page as o2.  If a file name or URL is specified
       before # and <page> is omitted, then o1 must be on the first page.

ATTRIBUTES
       Attributes are text strings of the form name=value or value which are
       attached to either the current drawing or any non-text objects.  An
       attribute attached to the current drawing is called a file attribute;
       otherwise, it is a regular attribute.  Attributes can be attached and
       detached from these objects except in the following case:

              Attributes appearing in the symbol object in a building-block
              object file can not be detached when the building-block object
              is instantiated.  These attributes are considered to be the
              ``inherited'' attributes of the icon object.  (If it is really
              necessary to detach inherited attributes of an icon object, the
              icon object can be ``de-iconified'' by using UnMakeIconic() in
              the Special Menu to make it a grouped object; then the
              attributes can be detached.)

       A file attribute is always invisible.  For a regular attribute, the
       user has control over which part of the attribute is displayed.  An
       entire attribute can be made invisible, or only its name can be made
       invisible (accomplished through the commands under the special menu,
       such as #m, #n, #j, #-, and ^#h).

TELEPORT/HYPERJUMP
       Tgif provides the mechanism to travel between .obj and .sym files.  If
       the middle mouse button is clicked on an object with the <Shift> key
       held down (or double-clicking such an object), tgif looks for an
       attribute named warp_to (by default) or href of that object.  The only
       difference between warp_to and href is that ".obj" is automatically
       appended to the value of a warp_to attribute while the value of a href
       attribute is taken as is.  (Please note that warp_to is obsolete now.
       It is still supported for the sake of compatibility.)  If such an
       attribute is found, the value part of the attribute is interpreted as
       the name of a .obj file to travel to.  (If tgif is in the hyperspace
       mode, then clicking the left mouse button has the same effect.)  If
       there are multiple href attributes on the object, but are in different
       colors, tgif will use the one that has the same color as the current
       color appearing in the Choice Window.  If the current file is modified,
       the user is prompted to save the file before traveling to the next
       file.  If the value part of the href attribute starts with the '/'
       character, the value is treated as an absolute file name; otherwise, it
       is treated as a relative file name.

HYPERSPACE
       Tgif provides a hyperspace mode to facilitate traveling between .obj
       files.  The hyperspace mode is entered when GoHyperSpace() is selected
       from the Navigate Menu.  In hyperspace mode, the little window below
       the Message Window will show a little space ship.  The hyperspace mode
       is also automatically entered when a remote URL is opened (unless the
       Tgif.AutoHyperSpaceOnRemote X default is set to false).

       In the hyperspace mode, certain objects are considered hot-links.  When
       the cursor is placed on top of these object, it will change from a
       pointer to a hand to indicate that clicking on the left mouse button
       will invoke some actions.  An object is a hot-link if it contains an
       attribute described in either the TELEPORT/HYPERJUMP, LAUNCH
       APPLICATIONS, or INTERNAL COMMANDS section.

       The hyperspace mode is exited when the drawing mode is changed or the
       LeaveHyperSpace() is selected from the Navigate Menu.

LAUNCH APPLICATIONS
       Tgif provides the mechanism to launch applications.  If the middle
       mouse button is clicked on an object with the <Shift> key held down (or
       double-clicking such an object), tgif looks for an attribute named
       launch (by default) of that object.  If such an attribute is found, the
       value part of the attribute is interpreted as a sh(1) command to
       execute.  Same color rule applies as described in the
       TELEPORT/HYPERJUMP section above.  If the command ends with the '&'
       character, tgif forks itself (what actual happens depends on whether
       the _BACKGROUND_DONT_FORK compiler flag is defined or not at compile
       time) and the command is executed by the child process; otherwise,
       popen() is used to execute the command (in this case, if the command
       hangs, there is no way provided to terminate the command, and tgif will
       not be able to recover from it).  Within the command, values of other
       attributes of the same object can be used.  The syntax is:  $(attr),
       where attr is the name of another attribute.

       For example, if one wants to perform a man(1) function, one can draw a
       box; enter a line of text "title=tgif"; enter another line of text
       "launch=xterm -rw -e man $(title)"; select all three objects using ^a
       keyboard command; attach the text strings to the box using #a keyboard
       command; and launch the man(1) command by clicking the middle mouse
       button on the box (or the text strings) with the <Shift> key held down.
       If one wants to be more fancy, the box can be replaced by an X11 pixmap
       object; the 'launch' attribute can be made invisible; and the 'title'
       attribute can be center justified and with its name hidden using the #m
       keyboard command.

       By default, launching of an application is disabled in the hyperspace
       mode for security considerations (this can be overridden by the
       Tgif.AllowLaunchInHyperSpace X default setting).  If a lunch command is
       encountered in the hyperspace mode, the command is displayed and the
       user is prompted to see if he/she wants to execute the command.

INTERNAL COMMANDS
       Tgif provides the mechanism to execute internal commands.  If the
       middle mouse button is clicked on an object with the <Shift> key held
       down (or double-clicking such an object), tgif looks for an attribute
       named exec (by default) of that object.  If such an attribute is found,
       the value part of the attribute is interpreted as a list of internal
       commands (separated by semicolon) to execute.  Same color rule applies
       as described in the TELEPORT/HYPERJUMP section above.  A command
       usually takes the form:

              <cmd_name> ( <arg1>, <arg2>, ..., <argN> )

       An argument of a command can be a string argument or a numeric
       argument.  A string argument must be enclosed in double-quotes.  A
       numeric argument can be a numerical value or a string of the form
       "$(x)", where x is the name of another attribute (this form is referred
       as the substitution form).  A string argument can also contain
       substitution form.  Please note that only one-level substitution are
       performed (the collection of internal commands should be viewed as a
       simple scripting language and not a declaration language).

       When an attribute is referenced in an internal command, the attribute
       name can be in the form, <obj_name>.<string>, where <obj_name> must be
       in the form specified in the OBJECT NAMES section above and <string>
       contains only alphanumeric characters and the underscore ('_')
       character.  If the first 2 characters of an attribute name is "!.", the
       rest of the attribute name names a file attribute.  If the first 2
       characters of an attribute name is "!*", the rest of the attribute name
       names an attribute of the currently selected object (if more than one
       object is selected, the top-most object in the stacking order is used).

       Please note that lines that begin with "//" are treated as comments.

       The following internal commands are supported:

       launch(<attr_name>)
              The value of the attribute specified by <attr_name> is
              interpreted as a sh(1) command to execute.  Please see the
              LAUNCH APPLICATIONS section above for more details.

       exec(<attr_name>)
              The value of the attribute specified by <attr_name> is
              interpreted as an internal command to execute.  This is similar
              to a subroutine call.  Please note that the internal command is
              executed in the context of the top-level which contain the
              attribute.

       mktemp(<str>,<attr_name>)
              This command makes a unique file name.  The <str> argument is a
              template string, e.g., "/tmp/TgifXXXXXX", and it requires at
              least two "/" in it.  The result of mktemp() is stored as the
              value of the attribute specified by <attr_name>.  Please see the
              man pages of the C library function on mktemp(3C) for more
              details.  (If tgif is compiled with the -D_USE_TMPFILE compiler
              option, then tempnam(3S) is used instead.)

       create_file_using_simple_template(<template>,<output>,<str>,<attr_name>)
              The file specified by <template> is scanned for a line that
              matches <str>.  When such a line is found, that line is replaced
              by the value of the attribute specified by <attr_name>.  The
              result is put into the file specified as <output>.

       update_eps_child(<eps_file_name>)
              This only works if the object being executed is a composite
              object.  If the object has a component which is an imported EPS
              (Encapsulated PostScript) object, it is replaced by the EPS file
              specified by <eps_file_name>.  If the object does not contain an
              EPS subobject, an EPS subobject is created.

       update_xbm_child(<xbm_file_name>)
              This only works if the object being executed is a composite
              object.  If the object has a component which is an imported XBM
              (X11 bitmap) object, it is replaced by the XBM file specified by
              <xbm_file_name>.  If the object does not contain an XBM
              subobject, an XBM subobject is created.

       update_xpm_child(<xpm_file_name>)
              This only works if the object being executed is a composite
              object.  If the object has a component which is an imported XPM
              (X11 pixmap) object, it is replaced by the XPM file specified by
              <xpm_file_name>.  If the object does not contain an XPM
              subobject, an XPM subobject is created.

       delete_eps_child(<obj_name>)
              This only works if the object named <obj_name> is a composite
              object.  If the object has a component which is an EPS
              (Encapsulated PostScript) object, it is deleted.  If the object
              does not contain an EPS subobject, no operation is performed.

       delete_xpm_child(<obj_name>)
              This only works if the object named <obj_name> is a composite
              object.  If the object has a component which is an XPM (X11
              pixmap) object, it is deleted.  If the object does not contain
              an XPM subobject, no operation is performed.

       delete_xbm_child(<obj_name>)
              This only works if the object named <obj_name> is a composite
              object.  If the object has a component which is an XBM (X11
              bitmap) object, it is deleted.  If the object does not contain
              an XBM subobject, no operation is performed.

       flip_deck(<times>,<frames_per_second>,<style>)
              This only works if the object being executed is a composite
              object and all subobjects of the composite object are X11 bitmap
              or X11 pixmap objects and have identical positions and sizes.
              The <times> argument specifies the number of times the deck is
              flipped.  It can be a number or the string "infinite".  The
              <frames_per_second> argument must be a number between 1 and 60.
              The <style> argument can be either "linear" or "ping_pong".
              When this command is being executed, any mouse button click or
              key click aborts command execution.

       read_file_into_attr(<file_name>,<attr_name>)
              This command reads a file into an attribute.  The <file_name>
              argument names a file, e.g., "/tmp/foo".  The content of the
              file is read as the value of the attribute specified by
              <attr_name>.  If the file can not be opened for read, the
              attribute's value is set to an empty string.

       write_attr_into_file(<attr_name>,<file_name>)
              This command writes the value of an attribute into a file.  The
              <file_name> argument names a file, e.g., "/tmp/foo".  The value
              of the attribute specified by <attr_name> is written into
              <file_name>.

       append_attr_into_file(<attr_name>,<file_name>)
              This command appends the value of an attribute into a file.  The
              <file_name> argument names a file, e.g., "/tmp/foo".  The value
              of the attribute specified by <attr_name> is appended into
              <file_name>.

       select_obj_by_name(<obj_name>)
              This command silently (no highlighting handles) selects an
              object named <obj_name>.  Please see the OBJECT NAMES section
              above for the specification of object names.

       select_top_obj()
              This command silently (no highlighting handles) selects the top
              object.  This command fails if there is no object in the current
              page.

       delete_selected_obj()
              This command deletes all selected objects.  This command fails
              if no object is selected.

       unselect_all_obj()
              This command de-selects all selected objects.  If the
              select_obj_by_name() command is used, this command must be used
              eventually.

       move_selected_obj_relative(<dx>,<dy>)
              This command moves the selected object by <dx> absolute units in
              the x direction and <dy> absolute units in the y direction.

       repeat(<cmd_attr_name>,<times>)
              This command executes the internal command in the
              <cmd_attr_name> attribute <times> times.

       hyperjump(<attr_name>)
              This command teleports to the file name or URL name found in the
              <attr_name> attribute.

       make_cgi_query(<dest_attr_name>,<url_name>,<list_attr_name>)
              This command constructs an URL in the Common Gateway Interface
              (CGI) format in the <dest_attr_name> attribute.  <url_name>
              names the CGI server script and <list_attr_name> names an
              attribute whose value are comma-separated attribute names.  For
              example, if an object has the following attributes:

                     attr_list=last_name,first_name
                     last_name=Cheng
                     first_name=Bill
                     final_url=
                     exec=make_cgi_query(final_url,
                         http://bourbon.usc.edu:8001/cgi-bin/test-cgi,
                         attr_list)

              Executing this object will construct the following string in
              final_url:

                     http://bourbon.usc.edu:8001/cgi-bin/test-
                     cgi?last_name=Cheng&first_name=Bill

              An subsequent hyperjump(final_url) command can be invoked to
              execute the corresponding "test-cgi" CGI server script with the
              last_name and first_name arguments.

              For a detailed description of CGI scripts, the reader is
              referred to [2].

       wait_click(<cursor_name>,<grab>,<attr_name>)
              This command displays the <cursor_name> cursor and waits for the
              user to click a mouse button.  If <cursor_name> is the string
              NULL (case-sensitive), the cursor will not change.  If <Btn1> is
              clicked, the command terminates and 1 is placed in <attr_name>.
              If <Btn2> is clicked, 2 is placed in <attr_name>, etc.  If
              <grab> set to TRUE (case-sensitive), then the mouse is grabbed
              by tgif.  Valid <cursor_name> can be found in <X11/cursorfont.h>
              (without the XC_ prefix).

       sleep(<cursor_name>,<ms_interval>)
              This command displays the <cursor_name> cursor and waits for
              <ms_interval> milliseconds to elapse.  If <cursor_name> is the
              string NULL (case-sensitive), the cursor will not change.  This
              command can be interrupted (and aborted) by any mouse clicks or
              key strokes.  Valid <cursor_name> can be found in
              <X11/cursorfont.h> (without the XC_ prefix).

       begin_animate()
              This command is used to start an animation sequence (using
              double-buffering).  Please note that, by default, tgif prepares
              for undo/redo.  For a long animation sequence, the undo/redo
              records may take up a lot of memory.  In this case,
              disable_undo() (described below) should be used before this
              command.

       end_animate()
              This command is used to terminate an animation sequence.

       set_redraw(<true_or_false>)
              This command is used to temporarily disable redraw if
              <true_or_false> is FALSE (case-sensitive) when tgif is in the
              animation mode (turned on by begin_animate()).  If a
              shuffle_obj_to_top() or a shuffle_obj_to_bottom() command is
              used before a move command, set_redraw(FALSE) and
              set_redraw(TRUE) should be used immediately before and
              immediately after, respectively, the shuffle_obj_to_top() or
              shuffle_obj_to_bottom() command.

       set_selected_obj_color(<color_str>)
              This command changes the color of the selected object to
              <color_str>.  If no object is selected, the current color will
              be changed to <color_str>.

       set_selected_obj_fill(<fill_index>)
              This command changes the fill pattern of the selected object to
              <fill_index>, which must be between 0 (for no fill) and 31.  If
              no object is selected, the current fill pattern will be changed
              to <fill_index>.

       set_selected_obj_pen(<pen_index>)
              This command changes the pen of the selected object to
              <pen_index>, which must be between 0 (for no pen) and 31.  If no
              object is selected, the current pen will be changed to
              <pen_index>.

       set_selected_obj_line_width(<width>,<arrow_w>,<arrow_h>)
              This command changes the line width, arrow width, and arrow
              height of the selected object to <width>, <arrow_w>, and
              <arrow_h>, respectively.  If <arrow_w> or <arrow_h> is -1, the
              arrow width or arrow height, respectively, is not changed.  If
              no object is selected, the current line width will be changed to
              the one that matches <width>, <arrow_w>, and <arrow_h> most
              closely.  (Closeness is measured such that the difference in
              width is counted 10 times the difference in arrow width and
              arrow height.)

       set_selected_obj_spline(<spline_type>)
              This command changes the spline type of the selected object to
              <spline_type>, which can be straight, spline, interpolated, or
              structured.  If no object is selected, the current spline type
              will be changed to <spline_type>.

       set_selected_obj_arrow(<arrow_type>)
              This command changes the arrow type of the selected object to
              <arrow_type>, which can be none, right, left, or double.  If no
              object is selected, the current arrow type will be changed to
              <arrow_type>.

       set_selected_obj_dash(<dash_index>)
              This command changes the dash type of the selected object to
              <dash_index>, which must be between 0 (solid) and 8.  If no
              object is selected, the current dash type will be changed to
              <dash_index>.

       set_selected_obj_trans_pat(<trans_pat>)
              This command changes selected object to have opaque pattern if
              <trans_pat> is 0; it changes selected object to have transparent
              pattern if <trans_pat> is any other numeric value.  If no object
              is selected, the current fill and pen pattern will be opaque if
              <trans_pat> is 0 and will be transparent if <trans_pat> is any
              other numeric value.

       set_selected_obj_rcb_radius(<rcb_radius>)
              This command changes the rcbox radius of the selected object to
              <rcb_radius>, which must be greater or equal to 4.  If no object
              is selected, the current rcbox radius will be changed to
              <rcb_radius>.

       set_selected_text_vspace(<vspace>)
              This command changes the text vspace of the selected object to
              <vspace>.  If no object is selected, the current text vspace
              will be changed to <vspace>.

       set_selected_text_just(<justification>)
              This command changes the text justification of the selected
              object to <justification>, which can be left, center, or right.
              If no object is selected, the current text justification will be
              changed to <justification>.

       set_selected_text_font(<ps_font_name>)
              This command changes the font and text style of the selected
              object to match <ps_font_name>.  Examples of valid
              <ps_font_name> can be found when one selects CopyProperties()
              from the Properties Menu.  The item listed under text font is a
              valid <ps_font_name>.  If no object is selected, the current
              font and text style will be changed to match <ps_font_name>.
              This command fails if no match can be found.

       set_selected_text_style(<textstyle>)
              This command changes the text style of the selected object to
              <textstyle>, which can be r (for roman), b (for bold), i (for
              italic), or bi (for bold-italic).  If no object is selected, the
              current text style will be changed to <textstyle>.

       set_selected_text_size(<size>)
              This command changes the text size of the selected object to
              <size>.  If <size> ends with the substring "pt", then point size
              is used instead of text size.  If such as size cannot be found
              in the Size Menu, the closest size in the Size Menu will be
              used.  If no object is selected, the current text size will be
              changed to <size> or the closest size.

       set_selected_text_underline(<underline>)
              This command removes text underline from the selected object if
              <underline> is 0; it underlines text in the selected object if
              <underline> is any other numeric value.  If no object is
              selected, the current text underline will be changed
              accordingly.

       set_selected_text_overline(<overline>)
              This command removes text overline from the selected object if
              <overline> is 0; it overlines text in the selected object if

              siblings.  This command is useful in animation where a selected
              frame (subobject) can be dropped to the bottom.

       disable_undo()
              This command cleans up the undo/redo records and disable undo
              (and stop recording undo/redo information).  The original
              history depth is saved away.  This command should be used before
              a long animation sequence.

       enable_undo()
              This command restores the history depth saved away by the
              disable_undo() command and enables undo/redo.  This command
              should be eventually used after disable_undo() is called.

              <cmd_attr_name> until <expr> evaluates to 0.

       if(<expr>,<then_cmd_attr_name>,<else_cmd_attr_name>)
              If <expr> evaluates to 0, the internal command in
              <else_cmd_attr_name> is executed; otherwise, the internal
              command in <then_cmd_attr_name> is executed.
              <then_cmd_attr_name> or <else_cmd_attr_name> can be the string

              and place the attribute at (<abs_x>,<abs_y>).  If <attr_name> is
              the string NULL (case-sensitive), the attribute's name will be
              the empty string.  If <abs_x> and <abs_y> are both NULL (case-
              sensitive), the attribute will be placed below the lower left
              corner of the object.  If <attr_name> starts with "!.", a file
              attribute will be added.

       delete_attr_from_selected_obj(<attr_name>)
              This command deletes an attribute named <attr_name> from a

              switches the drawing mode to the draw polyline/open-spline, and
              lets the user finish the polyline/open-spline.  If the endpoint
              falls in an object having an attribute type=port, that object's
              name will be placed in <attr_name>, if <attr_name> is not the
              string NULL (case-sensitive).

       user_draw_an_edge(<start_attr_name>,<end_attr_name>)
              This command switches the drawing mode to the draw
              polyline/open-spline and lets the user draw a polyline/open-
              spline.  If the first endpoint falls in an object having an
              attribute type=port, that object's name will be placed in
              <start_attr_name>, if <end_attr_name> is not the string NULL
              (case-sensitive).  If the last endpoint falls in an object
              having an attribute type=port, that object's name will be placed
              in <end_attr_name>, if <attr_name> is not the string NULL (case-
              sensitive).

              vertex of <obj_name> in attributes specified by <x_attr_name>
              and <y_attr_name>.  The object specified by <obj_name> must be
              either a poly/open-spline or a polygon/closed-spline object.

       move_a_poly_vertex_absolute(<obj_name>,<index>,<abs_x>,<abs_y>)
              This command moves the <index>th vertex of <obj_name> to the
              absolute coordinate (<abs_x>,<abs_y>).  The object specified by

              polygon/closed-spline object.

       post_attr_and_get_cgi_result(<url_attr>,<query_attr>,<result_attr>)
              This command makes an HTTP request using the POST method.
              <url_attr> names the attribute that contains the URL (which
              usually names a CGI server script).  <query_attr> names the
              attribute whose value is the data to be posted.  <result_attr>
              names the attribute for receiving the results.  For example, if
              an object has the following attributes:

                     url=http://bourbon.usc.edu:8001/cgi-bin/echo-post

                     exec=post_attr_and_get_cgi_result(url,query,result)

              executing this object will post "Hello World!" to the specified
              CGI script.  In this case, the result of executing the script
              just echoes "Hello World!" back (along with some other
              bookkeeping information).

       navigate_back()

                     while($(<attr_name>) <= <max_val>,loop)

              where loop has the following value:

                     exec(<cmd_attr_name>);
                     inc(<attr_name>,<increment>)

              This command copies the nth line of the attribute specified by
              <attr_name> into <result_attr>, where n is a zero-based index
              specified by <line_number>.

       trim(<attr_name>)
              This command removes leading and trailing blank characters from
              the attribute specified by <attr_name>.

       is_attr(<result_attr>,<attr_name>)
              This command writes a "1" into <result_attr> if the attribute
              specified by <attr_name> exists.  It writes a "0" into
              <result_attr> otherwise.

       find_obj_names(<result_attr>,<obj_name>,<attr_name_value>)
              This command finds all objects that are direct sub-objects of
              the object specified by <obj_name> and writes their names into
              <result_attr>.  If <obj_name> is an empty string, all top-level
              objects are scanned.

              <attr_name_value> specifies a filter for the objects.  If
              <attr_name_value> is the empty string, all qualifying objects
              are selected.  If <attr_name_value> is of the form "<string>=*",
              an object is selected if it has an attribute named <string>.  If
              <attr_name_value> is of the form "<string>=<value>", an object
              is selected if it has an attribute named <string> and its
              corresponding value is <value>.  If <attr_name_value> does not
              contain the '=' character, an object is selected if it has an
              attribute whose name is empty and the corresponding value is
              identical to <attr_name_value>.

              If n objects are matched, the attribute specified by
              <result_attr> is updated with n+1 lines.  The value of the
              zeroth line becomes n and the object names becomes lines 1
              through n of <result_attr>.  The get_line_in_attr() internal
              command can be used to retrieve the object names.

       find_obj_names_on_all_pages(<result_attr>,<attr_name_value>)
              This command is similar to find_obj_names() above, except that
              it only finds top-level objects on all pages.  The result is
              written into <result_attr>.  For a multi-page file, a top-level
              object name <name> will be written into <result_attr> as
              ##<page_num>!<name>.  For a single-page file, this command
              behaves exactly the same as
              find_obj_names(<result_attr,"",<attr_name_value>).

       tg2_find_obj_names_on_all_pages(<result_attr>,<attr_name_value>)
              This command is identical to find_obj_names_on_all_pages()
              above, except that for a multi-page file, a top-level object
              name <name> will be written into <result_attr> as
              <name>_Page<page_num>.

       tokenize(<result_attr>,<string>,<separator>)
              This command breaks <string> into tokens which are separated by
              the <separator> character and writes the tokens (in the same
              fashion as in the find_obj_names() internal command above) into
              <result_attr>.  <separator> must be a string of length of 1 and
              it must not be the space character, the single-quote character,
              or the double-quote character.  If a token contains the
              separator character, the token can be surrounded by a pair of
              single-quotes or double-quotes which are automatically removed
              when this command is executed.

              If n tokens are found, the attribute specified by <result_attr>
              is updated with n+1 lines.  The value of the zeroth line becomes
              n and the tokens becomes lines 1 through n of <result_attr>.
              The get_line_in_attr() internal command can be used to retrieve
              the tokens.

       move_attr_relative(<attr_name>,<dx>,<dy>)
              This command moves the attribute whose name is <attr_name> by
              <dx> absolute units in the x direction and <dy> absolute units
              in the y direction.

       get_number_of_vertices(<result_attr>,<obj_name>)
              This command copies the number of vertices of the object
              specified by <obj_name> into <result_attr>.  The specified
              object must be a polyline (open-spline) or a polygon (closed-
              spline).

       is_obj_transformed(<result_attr>,<obj_name>)
              This command writes a "1" into <result_attr> if the object
              specified by <obj_name> is transformed (rotated or sheared).  It
              writes a "0" into <result_attr> otherwise.

       make_selected_obj_iconic(<sym_path>)
              This command works like the MakeIconic() command from the
              Special Menu, except that the user is not prompted for the name
              of the icon.  Instead, <sym_path> is used to specify the full
              path name of the icon.

       get_tgif_version(<major_attr,minor_attr,patchlevel_attr,build_attr>)
              This command writes tgif's major version number, minor version
              number, patchlevel, and build information into <major_attr>,
              <minor_attr>, <patchlevel_attr> and <build_attr>, respectively.
              If an argument is the string NULL (case-sensitive), that
              information is skipped.

       get_tgif_dir(<result_attr>)
              This command writes "$HOME/.Tgif" into <result_attr> where $HOME
              is the home directory of the user.

       get_profile_string(<result_attr>,<section>,<key>,<def_value>,<ini_path>)
              This command gets the value associated with the key specified by
              <key> from the section specified by <section> in the file
              specified by the full path <ini_path> and stores it into the
              attribute specified by <result_attr>.  If there is not value
              associated with the specified key, <def_value> is stored into
              <result_attr>.  If <key> is an empty string, all the key names
              in <section> of <ini_path> will be written (in the same fashion
              as in the find_obj_names() internal command above) into
              <result_attr>.  If <section> is an empty string, all the section
              names in <ini_path> will be written (in the same fashion as in
              the find_obj_names() internal command above) into <result_attr>.

       write_profile_string(<section>,<key>,<value>,<ini_path>)
              This command sets the value associated with the key specified by
              <key> of the section specified by <section> in the file
              specified by the full path <ini_path> to be <value>.  If <key>
              is an empty string, all key/value pairs in <section> of
              <ini_path> will be cleared.  <section> should not be an empty
              string.

       select_additional_obj(<obj_name>)
              This command silently (no highlighting handles) selects an
              additional object named <obj_name>.  Please see the OBJECT NAMES
              section above for the specification of object names.

       open_file(<file_number>,<file_name>,<file_mode>)
              This command opens the file specified by <file_name> in the mode
              specified by <file_mode> and assigns the opened file a file
              reference number of <file_number>.  <file_number> must be 0 or
              between 3 and 15.  Opening file 0 rewinds the standard input.
              Examples of modes are "r" for reading, "w" for writing, and "a"
              for appending.  A file is always opened in text (non-binary)
              mode.

       close_file(<file_number>)
              This command closes the file associated with file reference
              number <file_number>.  <file_number> must be 0 or between 3 and
              15.

       read_file(<file_number>,<result_attr>)
              This command reads a line from the file associated with file
              reference number <file_number> and put the line in the attribute
              specified by <result_attr>.  <file_number> must be between 0
              (for standard input) or between 3 and 15.

       write_file(<file_number>,<string>)
              This command writes <string> to the file associated with file
              reference number <file_number>.  <file_number> must be between 1
              and 15.  Numbers 1 and 2 are for standard output and standard
              error files.

       flush_file(<file_number>)
              This command flushes the file associated with file reference
              number <file_number>.  <file_number> must be between 1 and 15.
              Numbers 1 and 2 are for standard output and standard error
              files.

       append_file(<dest_file_name>,<src_file_name>)
              This command appends the file specified by <src_file_name> to
              the file specified by <dest_file_name>.

       set_output_format(<format>,<color_output>)
              This command sets the output format to <format>.  If
              <color_output> is 0, black and white output (printing) mode will
              be used; otherwise, color output (printing) mode will be used.
              Please see the Tgif.WhereToPrint X default for a list of
              possible formats.

       set_export_clip_rect(<ltx>,<lty>,<rbx>,<rby>)
              This command sets the export clipping rectangle to be a
              rectangular region with left-top corner at (<ltx>,<lty>) and
              right-bottom corner at (<rbx>,<rby>).  <ltx> must be strictly
              less than <rbx> and <lty> must be strictly less than <rby>.

       import_file(<file_name>,<format>,<ltx>,<lty>)
              This command imports the file specified by <file_name> and
              places it at (<ltx>,<lty>).  The file is expected to be in the
              format specified by <format>, which can be "XBM", "XPM", "GIF",
              "PNG", "JPEG", "PBM", "PGM", "PPM", and names specified by the
              Tgif.ImportFilter# X defaults.  If <format> is "TGIF", the file
              should either be a tgif file.

       set_xpm_output_version(<version_number>)
              This command sets the XPM version number when outputting in the
              X11 pixmap format to be <version_number>.  <version_number> can
              take on values 1 or 3.

       edit_ini_section(<attr_name>,<title>,<section>,<ini_path>)
              This command brings up a dialogbox to edit the section specified
              by <section> in the file specified by the full path <ini_path>.
              If the user press the OK button in the dialogbox, the section is
              cleared and the content of the dialogbox is written back into
              the file, and "OK" is placed in the attribute specified by
              <attr_name>.  If the user press the CANCEL button in the
              dialogbox, the file is unmodified, and "CANCEL" is placed in the
              attribute specified by <attr_name>.

       select_from_ini_section(<attr_name>,<title>,<section>,<ini_path>)
              This command brings up a list to select an entry from the
              section specified by <section> in the file specified by the full
              path <ini_path>.  If nothing is selected, the attribute
              specified by <attr_name> will be cleared.  Otherwise, the
              selected entry will be written into the attribute specified by
              <attr_name>.

       append_line_into_attr(<attr_name>,<string>)
              This command appends the line specified by <string> to the
              attribute specified by <attr_name>.

       insert_line_into_attr(<attr_name>,<string>,<line_number>)
              This command inserts the line specified by <string> as the nth
              line of the attribute specified by <attr_name>, where n is a
              zero-based index specified by <line_number>.  n must be at least
              1.  If n is larger than the number of lines in the attribute,
              blank lines are automatically inserted.

       clear_attr(<attr_name>)
              This command clears the attribute value of the attribute
              specified by <attr_name> and deletes all other lines of the
              attribute if the attribute contains multiple lines.

       create_text_obj(<abs_x>,<abs_baseline_y>,<string>)
              This command creates a text object at the location
              (<abs_x>,<abs_baseline_y>) with the text specified by <string>.

       create_box_obj(<abs_ltx>,<abs_lty>,<abs_rbx>,<abs_rby>)
              This command creates a rectangle defined by
              (<abs_ltx>,<abs_lty>) and (<abs_rbx>,<abs_rby>).

       create_corner_oval_obj(<abs_ltx>,<abs_lty>,<abs_rbx>,<abs_rby>)
              This command creates a corner oval defined by
              (<abs_ltx>,<abs_lty>) and (<abs_rbx>,<abs_rby>).

       create_center_oval_obj(<abs_x>,<abs_y>,<radius>)
              This command creates a center oval centered at (<abs_x>,<abs_y>)
              with radius specified by <radius>.

       create_edge_oval_obj(<abs_ltx>,<abs_lty>,<abs_rbx>,<abs_rby>)
              This command creates an edge circle defined by
              (<abs_ltx>,<abs_lty>) and (<abs_rbx>,<abs_rby>).

       create_rcbox_obj(<abs_ltx>,<abs_lty>,<abs_rbx>,<abs_rby>)
              This command creates a rounded-corner rectangle defined by
              (<abs_ltx>,<abs_lty>) and (<abs_rbx>,<abs_rby>).

       create_arc_obj(<abs_x>,<abs_y>,<radius>,<dir>,<angle1>,<angle2>)
              This command creates an arc centered at (<abs_x>,<abs_y>) with
              radius, direction, start angle, and end angle specified by
              <radius>, <dir>, <angle1>, and <angle2>, respectively.  The
              <radius>, <dir>, <angle1>, and <angle2> are specified in the
              same way as they are specified in the SpecifyAnArc() command
              under the CreateObject submenu of the Edit Menu.  <dir> can be
              "+" or "-" where "+" is clockwise.  <angle1> and <angle2> are in
              degrees with 0 degree at the 12 o'clock position.

       create_first_vertex(<abs_x>,<abs_y>)
              This command is used in conjunction with the
              create_next_vertex() and create_poly_obj() commands to create a
              polyline/open-spline object.  It can also be used in conjunction
              with the create_next_vertex() and create_polygon_obj() commands
              to create a polygon/closed-spline object.  This command sets the
              starting point of the polyline/open-spline object or the
              polygon/closed-spline object to be at (<abs_x>,<abs_y>).

       create_next_vertex(<abs_x>,<abs_y>)
              This command is used in conjunction with the
              create_first_vertex() and create_poly_obj() commands to create a
              polyline/open-spline object.  It can also be used in conjunction
              with the create_first_vertex() and create_polygon_obj() commands
              to create a polygon/closed-spline object.  This command sets the
              next vertex of the polyline/open-spline object or the
              polygon/closed-spline object to be at (<abs_x>,<abs_y>).

       create_poly_obj()
              This command is used in conjunction with the
              create_first_vertex() and create_next_vertex() commands to
              create a polyline/open-spline object.

       create_polygon_obj()
              This command is used in conjunction with the
              create_first_vertex() and create_next_vertex() commands to
              create a polygon/closed-spline object.

       start_create_group_obj()
              This command is used in conjunction with the create_group_obj()
              command to create a grouped object.  This command marks the
              beginning of the group.

       create_group_obj()
              This command is used in conjunction with the
              start_create_group_obj() command to create a grouped object.
              This command groups all objects created since the last
              start_create_group_obj() call into a grouped object.

       set_allow_interrupt(<true_or_false>)
              If <true_or_false> is FALSE (case-sensitive), this command is
              used to temporarily disable an user interrupt when tgif is
              executing internal commands.  If a user interrupt is received
              when interrupt is disabled, it will be queued and will interrupt
              the execution of internal commands when set_allow_interrupt() is
              called again with <true_or_false> being TRUE (case-sensitive).

       select_each_obj_and_exec(<attr_name_to_exec>)
              This command first unselects any object that is selected.  It
              then selects each object in the current drawing in turn and
              executes the internal command specified by the
              <attr_name_to_exec> attribute.  If this command is executed as a
              result of a mouse click over an object, only objects in the
              current page will be scanned for execution.  If this command is
              executed from a script file, objects in every page will be
              scanned for execution.

       edit_attr_in_text_mode(<attr_name>)
              When this command is executed, tgif enters the text drawing mode
              and edits the attribute specified by <attr_name>.

       set_file_unsavable()
              This command is used to make the current file unsavable.

       pstoepsi(<target_eps_path>,<src_ps_path>,<scale>)
              This command generates a preview bitmap for the PostScript file
              in <src_ps_path> and prepends it to <src_ps_path> and save the
              output in <target_eps_path> (<src_ps_path> is unmodified).  The
              only accepted values of <scale> is 1 or 2.  If the
              Tgif.ExternalPsToEpsi X default is set to true, this command
              will simply invoke "pstoepsi <src_ps_path> <target_eps_path>"
              externally if <scale> is 1 and will invoke "pstoepsi -2x
              <src_ps_path> <target_eps_path>" if <scale> is 2.  This command
              only works if tgif is running in the interactive (non-batch)
              mode.

       objs_bbox_intersect(<obj1_name>,<obj2_name>,<result_attr>)
              This command sets the value of the attribute specified by
              <result_attr> to "1" if the boundingboxes of objects named
              <obj1_name> and <obj2_name> intersect.  It sets the value of the
              attribute specified by <result_attr> to "0" otherwise.

       delete_all_attr_from_selected_objs()
              This command deletes all attributes from selected objects.

GENERATING IMAGEMAP FILES
       This section describes how to generate NCSA imagemap and CERN clickable
       image files.  The Tgif.ImageMapFileFormat X default decides whether to
       generate a NCSA imagemap or a CERN clickable image file.  Since the two
       formats are very similar, we will only discuss how to generate NCSA
       imagemap files.  For more information about NCSA imagemap, please see
       [3].  For more information about CERN clickable image, please see [4].

       The Tgif.GenerateImageMap X default should be set to ``true'' to enable
       the imagemap generation.  When printing in the GIF format (see the
       BASIC FUNCTIONALITIES section about printing), an XPM file (which will
       be removed at the end of this process) is generated first.  (The value
       specified by the Tgif.InitExportPixelTrim X default is used to trim
       extra pixels.  Using these values forms an escape mechanism to fix an
       idiosyncrasy that tgif can not figure out exactly how big the whole
       image is.)

       The XPM version is specified by the Tgif.XPmOutputVersion X default
       unless the Tgif.UseXPmVersion1ForImageMap X default is set to ``true'',
       which forces the XPM1 format.  Then the command specified by the
       Tgif.XpmToGif X default is executed to convert the XPM file into a GIF
       (Generic Interchange Format) file which can be used by software such as
       NCSA's Mosaic(1).  The file extension for the GIF file is specified by
       the Tgif.GifFileExtension X default.  Together with the GIF file, an
       imagemap file with file extension specified by the
       Tgif.ImageMapFileExtension X default is generated.  The content of the
       imagemap is generated as follows.

       Tgif first looks for a file attribute with attribute name href.  The
       value of the attribute is written as the default URL.  If such a file
       attribute can not be found, imagemap generation is aborted.  If it is
       found, then all objects in the file are scanned.  For an object having
       an attribute named href, the value of the attribute is written as the
       URL for a method line in the imagemap.  If the object is neither a
       circle nor a poly/polygon, the rectangle method is used.

       Similar mechanism is used when printing in the HTML format, except that
       a generic HTML file is generated with an imagemap in the Spy Glass
       Client-side Imagemap format.  You can generate a custom HTML file if
       you specify an HTML export template using SetHTMLExportTemplate() from
       the File Menu.  Details about the template file is described below.

HTML EXPORT TEMPLATE
       If an HTML export template file is specified with the
       SetHTMLExportTemplate() from the File Menu, custom HTML files can be
       generated when printing in the HTML format.  The customization is done
       through the use of variables embedded in the HTML export template file.
       These variables have the syntax of an HTML character entity.  They all
       starts with "&tgv" and ends with ";".  They are:

       &tgvfilename;
              This variable will be replaced by the name of the file (without
              file extension).

       &tgvcurnum;
              This variable will be replaced by current page number.

       &tgvfirstnum;
              This variable will be replaced by the first page number (usually
              1).

       &tgvlastnum;
              This variable will be replaced by last page number.

       &tgvprevnum;
              This variable will be replaced by the previous page number (with
              wrap around).

       &tgvprevnumnowrap;
              This variable will be replaced by the previous page number (with
              no wrap around).

       &tgvnextnum;
              This variable will be replaced by the next page number (with
              wrap around).

       &tgvnextnumnowrap;
              This variable will be replaced by the next page number (with no
              wrap around).

       &tgvtitle;
              This variable will be replaced by the title the page or of the
              file.

       &tgvmapobjs;
              This variable will be replaced by the objects (specified as
              <AREA> tabs) in a client-side image map.

       For example, if a template specifies:

              <IMG SRC="&tgvfilename;-&tgvcurnum;.gif"
                     USEMAP="#p0">
              <MAP NAME="p0">
              &tgvmapobjs;
              <AREA SHAPE="RECT"
                     COORDS="0,0,&tgvmapwidth;,&tgvmapheight;"
                     HREF="&tgvfilename;-&tgvnextnum;.html">
              </MAP>

       Exporting using PrintOneFilePerPage() with this template may get (for
       page 2 of a file name "foo.obj" with 5 pages):

              <IMG SRC="foo-2.gif"
                     USEMAP="#p0">
              <MAP NAME="p0">
              <AREA SHAPE="RECT" ...>
               ...
              <AREA SHAPE="RECT" ...>
              <AREA SHAPE="RECT"
                     COORDS="0,0,145,97"
                     HREF="foo-3.html">
              </MAP>

GENERATING MICROSOFT WINDOWS EPSI FILES
       Some Microsoft Windows (TM) applications do not understand standard
       PostScript %%BeginPreview, %%EndImage, and %%EndPreview comments.  This
       section describes how to generate an EPSI file which is understood by
       them.  This feature is invoked when the current print format is
       TiffEPSI.  In this case, the generated EPSI file will contain 30 bytes
       of binary information in the beginning of the file and a TIFF image
       (also binary) at the end of the file.  This file also will not contain
       the %%BeginPreview, %%EndImage, and %%EndPreview comments.  A file in
       this format is normally not considered to be a PostScript file except
       under Windows.

       When this feature is enabled, tgif generates a normal EPSI file first,
       then dump the current content of the file into an X11 bitmap file.  The
       command specified in Tgif.XbmToTiff is executed to generate a TIFF
       image which is then append at the end of the EPSI file.

LOCKING OBJECTS
       Objects can be locked and unlocked using #< and #> keyboard commands.
       When a selected object is locked, it is shown with gray handles.  A
       locked object cannot be moved, stretched, flipped, or rotated; however,
       its properties, such as fill pattern, width, etc., can be changed.
       Locked objects can also be deleted.  When a locked object is grouped
       with other objects, the resulting grouped object is also locked.  A
       locked object can be used as an anchor to align other objects; however,
       DistributeObjs() command will fail if any objects are locked.  Locked
       objects do not participate in any operations in the select vertex mode.

UNDO/REDO
       Most operations can be undone and redone.  The Tgif.HistoryDepth X
       default controls the size of the undo buffer.  If it is set to -1, then
       the undo buffer's size is infinite.  The undo buffer is flushed when
       the New() or Open() commands are executed (from the File Menu), when
       the FlushUndoBuffer() command is executed from the Edit Menu, or when
       Pop() is executed from a .sym file.  If a private colormap is used
       (automatically done when new colors can not be allocated from the
       default colormap), executing FlushUndoBuffer() will attempt to reset
       the colormap (if the -DDONT_FREE_COLORMAP compile option is not used).

DOMAINS
       A domain is a collection of library symbols suitable for
       instantiations.  A library is implemented as a directory of .sym files,
       and therefore, a domain is implemented as a search path.  If there are
       symbols with the same file name which reside in different directories
       specified in the search path, then the one closer to the front of the
       search path will be made available for the user to instantiate.

       The number of domains is specified by the MaxDomains X default, and the
       names of the domains are specified by the DomainPath# X default.  The
       library search paths are specified by csh environment variables.  See
       the section on X DEFAULTS for more details.

       Domain information can also be loaded into the ~/.Tgif/domain.ini file
       by setting Tgif.DomainInIni to true and selecting Reload Domain Info
       From X from the Domain submenu of the File Menu.

SELECTING A NAME FROM A POPUP WINDOW
       When selecting a file name, a symbol name, or a domain name, tgif pops
       up a window with appropriate names for the user to choose from.  The
       user can use mouse clicks to select an entry.  Key strokes can also be
       used to specify the desired name; however, tgif attempts to match the
       key strokes with names in the selection on the fly.  If a match can not
       be found, the key strokes are ignored.  ^n, ^j, or the DownArrow key
       advances the selection down by 1 entry; ^p, ^k, or the UpArrow key
       advances the selection up by 1 entry.  ^f, ^d, or the DownArrow key
       with <Control> key held down advances the selection down by 10 entries;
       ^b, ^u, or the UpArrow key with <Control> key held down advances the
       selection up by 10 entries.  '$' will select the last entry, while '^'
       will select the first entry.  ^w or ^y un-select the selected entry.
       If the selected entry is a directory, hitting <CR> will change
       directory; if not, hitting <CR> finishes the selection process and the
       selected entry is returned.

       In selecting file names to open or import, typing '/' is interpreted as
       going to the root directory or specifying an URL.  At this point, the
       automatic matching of key strokes is temporarily disabled until either
       a <TAB> or a <CR> is pressed.  Also, clicking the middle mouse button
       in the file name area pastes from the clipboard.

       The automatic appending of index.obj or .obj (introduced in version
       2.16) became obsolete and an URL is never modified.

       The current selection is displayed near the top of the popup window.
       Back-space should be used with caution because it might change the
       current directory to the parent directory.

IMPORTING EPS FILES
       Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) files can be imported using the #(
       keyboard command.  If the EPS file has a preview bitmap (can be
       generated using the pstoepsi tool), tgif will display it
       (HideBit/Pixmap() from the Layout Menu can be used to disable the
       displaying of bitmap/pixmaps).  When the EPS object is saved in a .obj
       or .sym file, neither the preview bitmap, nor the PostScript content of
       the EPS file is saved.  Therefore, when printing such a file (either
       from tgif or using prtgif), the EPS file must be present at the same
       place from which it was originally imported.

ADDITIONAL FONTS
       In addition to the Times, Courier, Helvetica, NewCentury, and Symbol
       fonts, additional fonts can be specified using the Tgif.AdditionalFonts
       X default.  (The default screen fonts can also be replaced, please see
       Tgif.HasAlternateDefaultFonts in the X DEFAULTS section for more
       details.)  Each additional font requires 4 parts, one for each font
       style (in the order of Roman, Bold, Italic, and BoldItalic).  Each part
       contains 3 strings.  The first string specifies the family, weight,
       slant, and width of the font (please see the man pages for xfontsel(1)
       for more details; also there is a second form which is described
       below).  The second string specifies the registry and encoding of the
       font (see xfontsel(1) again).  (One can use xlsfonts(1) to see what
       fonts are available and pick out the just mentioned two strings from
       the output.)  The third string specifies the PostScript font name.

       For example, if one wants to use the X Lucida font to represent the
       PostScript ZapfChancery-MediumItalic font, one can set
       Tgif.AdditionalFonts as follows:

       Tgif.AdditionalFonts: \n\
               lucida-medium-r-normal \n\
               iso8859-1 \n\
               ZapfChancery-MediumItalic \n\
               \n\
               lucida-demibold-r-normal \n\
               iso8859-1 \n\
               ZapfChancery-MediumItalic \n\
               \n\
               lucida-medium-i-normal \n\
               iso8859-1 \n\
               ZapfChancery-MediumItalic \n\
               \n\
               lucida-demibold-i-normal \n\
               iso8859-1 \n\
               ZapfChancery-MediumItalic

       The above maps all four font styles of the Lucida font to the
       ZapfChancery-MediumItalic font (similar to how Symbol font is handled).

       The first string can also be specified in a second form which is
       identified by having "%d" as part of the string.  For example, one can
       use "lucidasans-%d" as the first string.  In this case, the actual X
       font used will be the specified string with "%d" replaced by the font
       size.  The encoding string (second string) is ignored (but must be
       present).  The font name prefix (please see Tgif.FontNamePrefix entry
       in the X DEFAULTS section) is also ignored.

POSTSCRIPT CHARACTER ENCODING FOR INTERNATINOAL CHARACTERS
       Sometimes, different encodings of the same PostScript font is needed
       for characters with character codes between 161 and 255 (inclusive).
       This can be accomplished in two ways.  One way is to use
       Tgif.AdditionalDontReencode (and Tgif.DontReencode).  Another way is to
       use Tgif.PSFontNeedCharSubs.  The difference is that with
       Tgif.AdditionalDontReencode, a PostScript font's encoding is skipped.
       With Tgif.PSFontNeedCharSubs, characters in a PostScript font can be
       given specific encoding.

       In both cases, there is a need to introduce fake font names (place
       holders).  For example,

              Tgif.AdditionalFonts: \n\
                      utopia-medium-r-normal \n\
                      adobe-fontspecific \n\
                      UtopiaTmp-Regular \n\
                      \n\
                      utopia-bold-r-normal \n\
                      adobe-fontspecific \n\
                      UtopiaTmp-Bold \n\
                      \n\
                      utopia-medium-i-normal \n\
                      adobe-fontspecific \n\
                      UtopiaTmp-Italic \n\
                      \n\
                      utopia-bold-i-normal \n\
                      adobe-fontspecific \n\
                      UtopiaTmp-BoldItalic
              Tgif.PSFontAliases: \n\
                      UtopiaTmp-Regular=Utopia-Regular \n\
                      UtopiaTmp-Bold=Utopia-Bold \n\
                      UtopiaTmp-Italic=Utopia-Italic \n\
                      UtopiaTmp-BoldItalic=Utopia-BoldItalic

       In the above example, 4 fake PostScript font names are created (all
       have a common "UtopiaTmp" prefix).  The encoding for these fonts is
       adobe-fontspecific, according the X11 fonts being used.
       Tgif.PSFontAliases maps the fake PostScript font names to the
       corresponding real PostScript font names.  (If Tgif.PSFontAliases is
       missing, non-existent PostScript font names such as UtopiaTmp-Regular
       will appear in a PostScript file.)

       To skip a PostScript font's encoding, one can use the
       Tgif.AdditionalDontReencode X default.  For example, if one specifies:

              Tgif.AdditionalDontReencode: UtopiaTmp

       characters with character codes between 161 and 255 (inclusive) will
       not be encoded with ISO-Latin-1 character names.  For a list of
       characters names that are ISO-Latin-1 encoded, please see
       <URL:http://bourbon.usc.edu/tgif/faq/charencode.html#iso8859-1>.

       To substitute characters in a PostScript font with specific encoding,
       one can use the Tgif.PSFontNeedCharSubs and Tgif.PSCharSubs_* X
       defaults.  (You still need Tgif.AdditionalFonts and Tgif.PSFontAliases
       setup as above.)  Here is an example:

              Tgif.PSFontNeedCharSubs: \n\
                      Utopia-Regular=Foo \n\
                      Utopia-Bold=Foo \n\
                      Utopia-Italic=Foo \n\
                      Utopia-BoldItalic=Foo
              Tgif.PSCharSubs_Foo: \n\
                      exclamdown/Aogonek \n\
                      AE/Cacute \n\
                      ecircumflex/eogonek

       In the above example, Tgif.PSFontNeedCharSubs specified a list of fake
       PostScript font names that requires character substitutions and their
       corresponding TOKEN names.  For a fake PostScript font name that maps
       to TOKEN, the list of characters to be substituted is specified in the
       Tgif.PSCharSubs_TOKEN X default.  The format for Tgif.PSCharSubs_TOKEN
       is a list of OLDCHARCODE/NEWCHARNAME strings where OLDCHARCODE is a
       character code in decimal or octal format and NEWCHARNAME must be the
       name of a PostScript character.  In the above example, Foo was used as
       the TOKEN name.  In real use, something like iso8895-2 may be more
       appropriate for a TOKEN name.  Since decimal or octal codes are
       allowed, the following is equivalent to the above:

              Tgif.PSFontNeedCharSubs: \n\
                      Utopia-Regular=iso8859-2 \n\
                      Utopia-Bold=iso8859-2 \n\
                      Utopia-Italic=iso8859-2 \n\
                      Utopia-BoldItalic=iso8859-2
              Tgif.PSCharSubs_iso8859-2: \n\
                      161/Aogonek \n\
                      8#306/Cacute \n\
                      8#312/eogonek

       Please note that substitution only occurs for characters with character
       codes between 161 and 255 (inclusive).

       <URL:http://bourbon.usc.edu/tgif/faq/charencode.html#charsubs>.

SQUARE DOUBLE BYTE FONTS
       Starting with version 4.0 of tgif, double-byte fonts are supported.
       But only double-fonts where every character has the same width and
       height are supported.  Double-byte fonts is specified using the
       Tgif.SquareDoubleByteFonts X default.  The format of this X default is
       similar to that of the Tgif.AdditionalFonts X default described in the
       ADDITIONAL FONTS section above with differences described here.  Each
       double-byte font requires 4 parts, one for each font style (in the
       order of Roman, Bold, Italic, and BoldItalic).  Each part contains 3
       strings.  The first string specifies the name of the font.  It must
       contain a "%d" as part of the string.  The actual X font used will be
       the specified string with "%d" replaced by the font size.  The second
       string can be either "*", "H", or "V".  When it is the "V" string, each
       character is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.  Otherwise, the
       characters are not rotated.  The third string specifies the PostScript
       font name.

       Using input methods (specified by the Tgif.DoubleByteInputMethod X
       default) one can mix english (single-byte) substrings within a double-
       byte string.  The font to use for the english substring is specified by
       the Tgif.DefaultSingleByteFont X default.

       For example, if one wants to use the X Song Ti font to represent
       PostScript GB-Song-Regular font, one can set Tgif.SquareDoubleByteFonts
       as follows:

       Tgif.DefaultSingleByteFont: Helvetica
       Tgif.GBShowFontChar: 271372 Tgif.GBConvFromUTF8: iconv -f utf8 -t
       gb2312 Tgif.GBUConvToUTF8: iconv -f gb2312 -t utf8
       Tgif.SquareDoubleByteFonts: \n\
              -isas-song ti-*-*-*--%d-*-*-*-*-*-gb2312.1980-0 \n\
                      * \n\
                      GB-Song-Regular \n\
              \n\
              -isas-song ti-*-*-*--%d-*-*-*-*-*-gb2312.1980-0 \n\
                      * \n\
                      GB-Song-Regular \n\
              \n\
              -isas-song ti-*-*-*--%d-*-*-*-*-*-gb2312.1980-0 \n\
                      * \n\
                      GB-Song-Regular \n\
              \n\
              -isas-song ti-*-*-*--%d-*-*-*-*-*-gb2312.1980-0 \n\
                      * \n\
                      GB-Song-Regular

       In the above example, the Song Ti font doesn't have styles such as
       italic and bold, so all four parts are identical.  The
       Tgif.GBShowFontChar X default specifies a double-byte octal character
       to be used to represent this font in the Choice Window when this font
       is selected.  The Tgif.GBUConvFromUTF8 X default specifies a command to
       run when an UTF8-encoded string is to be pasted into a text object in
       the GB font.  The Tgif.GBUConvToUTF8 X default specifies a command to
       run in a copy operation to convert a selected string (in GB font) to
       the UTF8 format then copied to the clipboard.

       Below is another example of using the X JIS fonts to represent
       PostScript Ryumin-Light-EUC-H and Ryumin-Light-EUC-V fonts as follows:

       Tgif.RyuminShowFontChar: 244242
       Tgif.SquareDoubleByteFonts: \n\
              -jis-fixed-*-*-*--%d-*-*-*-*-*-jisx0208.1983-* \n\
                      H \n\
                      Ryumin-Light-EUC-H \n\
              -jis-fixed-*-*-*--%d-*-*-*-*-*-jisx0208.1983-* \n\
                      H \n\
                      Ryumin-Light-EUC-H \n\
              -jis-fixed-*-*-*--%d-*-*-*-*-*-jisx0208.1983-* \n\
                      H \n\
                      Ryumin-Light-EUC-H \n\
              -jis-fixed-*-*-*--%d-*-*-*-*-*-jisx0208.1983-* \n\
                      H \n\
                      Ryumin-Light-EUC-H \n\
              \n\
              -jis-fixed-*-*-*--%d-*-*-*-*-*-jisx0208.1983-* \n\
                      V \n\
                      Ryumin-Light-EUC-V \n\
              -jis-fixed-*-*-*--%d-*-*-*-*-*-jisx0208.1983-* \n\
                      V \n\
                      Ryumin-Light-EUC-V \n\
              -jis-fixed-*-*-*--%d-*-*-*-*-*-jisx0208.1983-* \n\
                      V \n\
                      Ryumin-Light-EUC-V \n\
              -jis-fixed-*-*-*--%d-*-*-*-*-*-jisx0208.1983-* \n\
                      V \n\
                      Ryumin-Light-EUC-V

MULTIPAGE DRAWING
       An object file can contain multiple pages.  Two layout modes, stacked
       and tiled, for a multipage drawing are supported.  In stacked layout
       mode, pages are considered to be stacked on top of each other, and
       therefore, an object can only appear on one page.  In tiled layout
       mode, pages are tiled to form a large logical page; in this case, an
       object can exist on several physical pages simultaneously.  Swiching
       between the two modes are considered rare events and can not be undone.
       Tgif does not allow switching from the tiled layout mode to the stacked
       mode when there exists an object that spans physical page boundaries
       because it can not decide which physical page the object belongs.

       Page numbers are supported through the use of page numbering objects.
       A page number objecting is an object that contains an attribute whose
       name is !PAGE_NUM (the name is case-sensitive) and the name part of
       that attribute is not shown (hiding an attribute name can be achieved
       by using the Move/JustifyAttr() command under the Attribute submenu of
       the Special Menu).  The value of the attribute determines how the page
       number is printed.  If the value of the attribute contains a
       !(STACKED_PAGE_NUM) substring, that part of the substring will be
       replaced by the page number if the page layout mode is stacked.  If the
       page layout mode is tiled, the string will be printed out as is.  If
       the value of the attribute contains a !(STACKED_NUM_PAGES) substring,
       that part of the substring will be replaced by the number of pages if
       the page layout mode is stacked.  If the value of the attribute
       contains a !(TILED_PAGE_ROW) or !(TILED_PAGE_COL) substring, that part
       of the substring will be replaced by the row number or the column
       number of the physical page if the page layout mode is tiled.

SPECIAL ATTRIBUTES
       There are a few special attributes that tgif recognized.  There are
       described in this section.  They are all case-sensitive.

       !PAGE_NUM=<page_number>
              This specifies the page numbers in a multipage drawing.  Please
              see the MULTIPAGE DRAWING section for details.

       auto_center_attr
              If an attribute's name is empty and the value is
              auto_center_attr, then all the visible attributes of the owner
              object will automatically be centered relative to the bounding
              box of the owner object.  It doesn't really make sense to have
              multiple visible attributes because they will overlap.  This
              attribute is useful for making simple flowchart elements.

       unmakeiconic_on_instantiate
              If a symbol object's attribute has an empty attribute name and
              the value is unmakeiconic_on_instantiate, then when the symbol
              is instantiated, the following commands are performed on the
              just-instantiated icon object: 1) UnMakeIconic() command from
              the Special Menu, 2) UnGroup() command from the Arrange Menu,
              and 3) the "unmakeiconic_on_instantiate" text object is removed.
              This attribute is useful for making simple flowchart segments.

       unmakeiconic_on_instantiate_delete_attrs
              If a symbol object's attribute has an empty attribute name and
              the value is unmakeiconic_on_instantiate_delete_attrs, then when
              the symbol is instantiated, the following commands are performed
              on the just-instantiated icon object: 1) UnMakeIconic() command
              from the Special Menu, 2) delete all attributes from this
              object, and 3) UnGroup() command from the Arrange Menu.  This
              attribute is useful for putting a group of "useful" objects into
              a symbol object.

       retracted_arrows
              If an attribute's name is empty and the value is
              retracted_arrows for a polyline or open-spline object with more
              than 2 vertices, then the arrows of the spline object is
              retracted by one vertex.

       auto_retracted_arrows
              This is very similar to the retracted_arrows above except that
              the object must be an interpolated open-spline with only one
              arrow head.  The spline object is forced to have 3 vertices and
              the middle vertex of the spline object is automatically adjusted
              when an endpoint is moved.

       auto_exec=<internal_command>
              If such a file attribute exists, the value is executed when the
              file is opened (unless the file is opened as a result of
              executing the hyperjump_then_exec() internal command).

       edit_attrs_in_context_menu=...
              If an object has an attribute named edit_attrs_in_context_menu,
              the values (starting from the 2nd line and separated by
              linebreaks) of this attribute are treated as attribute names.
              The named attributes will be visible in the Edit Attribute In
              Editor submenu of the Context Menu.  For example, if an object
              has the following attributes:

                     edit_attrs_in_context_menu=
                            x
                            y
                            z
                     w=greetings
                     x=hello
                     y=world
                     z=how are you
                     good-bye

              the Edit Attribute In Editor submenu of the Context Menu will
              only show "x=hello", "y=world", and "z=how are you".

EXPORT TO TABLE
       When the ExportToTable() command is selected from the Table submenu of
       the Special Menu, certain attributes of selected objects are written
       into a user-specified output file in a format which can be easily
       imported by a spreadsheet program or to be used by the MergeWithTable()
       command described in the next section.  An output file contains columns
       of strings.  Two columns are separated by a single <TAB> character.
       The first row of a output file contains the column names and all other
       rows contain values.

       The names of the attributes to be written are specified by the file
       attribute named TABLE_ATTRS (which is denoted by !.TABLE_ATTRS here).
       The value of the TABLE_ATTRS file attribute is a list of comma-
       separated attribute names.  When ExportToTable() command is executed,
       the attribute names specified by !.TABLE_ATTRS are written to the
       output file first.  Then, for each selected object, every one of its
       attribute which appears in the list specified by !.TABLE_ATTRS are
       written to the output file in one line.  If an object has no attributes
       that match the specification, no corresponding line is generated.

MERGE WITH TABLE
       When the MergeWithTable() command is selected from the Table submenu of
       the Special Menu, a selected object is merged (also known as mail-
       merged on PCs) with a table (data) file (in the same format as the
       output file described in the previous section) to generate a new
       multipage drawing having the stacked page layout mode.

       The selected object contains formating information, and it is also used
       as a template to be replicated for each data row in the table file.  If
       an attribute of the replica matches the column name of the table, the
       attribute value is set to the value in the table file.  The replicas
       are tiled horizontally first.

       Eight attributes must be specified in the template object.  They are
       all case-sensitive.  The ones that measure distances can be specified
       in inches ("in"), centi-meters ("cm"), or pixels (if no units are
       specified).

              PAPER_WIDTH
                     This specifies the width of the paper.

              PAPER_HEIGHT
                     This specifies the height of the paper.

              LEFT_MARGIN
                     This specifies the distance to the left edge of the
                     paper.

              TOP_MARGIN
                     This specifies the distance to the top edge of the paper.

              H_PITCH
                     This specifies the distance between the left edges of the
                     replicas.

              V_PITCH
                     This specifies the distance between the top edges of the
                     replicas.

              NUM_COLS
                     This specifies the number of replicas to tile
                     horizontally before moving down to the next row.

              NUM_ROWS
                     This specifies the number of replicas to tile vertically
                     before moving to the next page.

       After each replica is generated, filled with the data from the table
       file, and placed, its attribute named exec is executed (unless an
       attribute named EXEC_AFTER_MERGE is specified, in which case, the
       attribute named by the EXEC_AFTER_MERGE attribute is executed instead).
       If there is no attribute named by the EXEC_AFTER_MERGE attribute,
       nothing is executed.  (Please see the INTERNAL COMMANDS section for
       details on command execution.)  One can use the exec command to
       construct other attributes from the attributes associated with the data
       table.

       If an attribute whose name is empty and whose value is the string
       USER_PLACEMENT, the user will be asked to place the replica (object
       name will be displayed in the Status Window when the object is being
       placed).  In this case, the 8 placement related attributes are ignored.

       If an attribute whose name is empty and whose value is the string
       STRIP_DOUBLE_QUOTES, data fields surrounded by double-quotes are
       stripped.

MIME TYPES AND MAILCAPS
       When an URL names an HTTP server, the HTTP server sends the Content-
       type of the URL along with the remote file referenced by the URL to
       tgif.  The Content-type contains information such as the type/subtype
       of the file plus some optional fields.  If the file is not a tgif file,
       the following mechanism is used to view the file.

       First, the X defaults are looked up to see if there is an external
       viewer specified for the file.  Please see Tgif.@@@Viewer in the X
       DEFAULTS section below for details.  If there's no match, the
       type/subtype is matched against entries in the MIME-types file.  The
       default MIME-types file is .mime.types in user's home directory.
       Please see Tgif.MimeTypesFile in the X DEFAULTS section on how to
       override the default MIME-types file.  The first field in each line of
       the MIME-types file specifies type/subtype information.  If there is a
       type/subtype match in the MIME-types files, the MailCap files are
       consulted as follows.

       A line in a MailCap file consists of fields separated by semi-colons.
       The first field specifies the type/subtype and the second field
       specifies a view command for viewing a file that matches the
       type/subtype.  For tgif, the view command must contains a single %s
       substring to be replaced by local copy of the URL.  Only the %t and the
       %{} optional fields are supported by tgif.  The multipart MIME-type is
       not supported.  The type/subtype information of the remote file is
       matches against the MailCap files.  If a match is found, the
       corresponding view command is executed.  If no match is found, but the
       type of the remote file is either application, audio, image, or video,
       the file is saved and no external viewer is launched.  Otherwise, the
       remote file is assumed to be pure text and tgif will create a text
       object to view the text.

       The MailCap files are the (colon-separated) files specified by the
       MAILCAP environment variable (if defined).  If MAILCAP is not defined,
       the .mailcap file in the user's home directory is used.

       MIME is the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions specified in RFC1521,
       and MAILCAP is specified in RFC1524.

HOW TO MAKE A BUILDING-BLOCK OBJECT (SYMBOL FILE)
       Here are the steps for defining a building-block object, to be used in
       a hierarchical design.

       1)     Draw the representation part of the building-block object.
              Group everything together.  Select this grouped object.

       2)     Popup the main menu with the middle mouse button; select
              ``Special''.  Select ``MakeSymbolic'' from the next popup menu.
              The selected object becomes a symbol and gets a dashed boundary.

       3)     Type in attributes as individual text strings.  Select the
              symbol object and all the text strings to be attached to the
              symbol.  Type #a (for Attach) to attach attributes to the
              symbol.

       4)     (This step is optional.)  Build the definition part of the
              building-block object.  Look at the ``flip-flop.sym'' file for
              an example.  To look at that file, first, instantiate a ``flip-
              flop'' by typing ^i (for Instantiate).  Select the flip-flop
              from the popup window; place the flip-flop; select the flip-flop
              and type #v (for Push) to see the symbol file.

       5)     Save and name the file.  If the current library path contains
              the current directory (or '.'), the symbol just built should be
              instantiatable by typing ^i.

X11 PIXMAP (XPM) FORMATS
       Tgif can only import X11 pixmaps that satisfy the constraints described
       here.  The format of the X11 pixmap must be either 1 (XPM1) or 3
       (XPM3).  Only a subset of the XPM3 format is supported, namely, the key
       field for the color specification must be 'c' (for color visuals).
       Tools that generate XPM1 format files are (they might have been
       upgraded to support XPM3), pbmplus (or netpbm), which is a set of
       bitmap and pixmap conversion freeware (together with xv, the colors for
       pixmap objects can be manipulated), and xgrabsc, another freeware;
       also, xloadimage can display XPM1 files.  Tools that can generate XPM3
       format files are, for example, xsnap(1) and sxpm(1).  For each color
       specified in the color string, a color cell is allocated.  If the
       allocation fails, the current color will be used for that color string.
       If the first color character is a back-quote (`) or a space, then the
       corresponding color is substituted with the background color of the
       tgif window if the Tgif.GuessXPmBgColor X default is set to ``true''.
       (This design choice is made because the pixmap will then look ``right''
       on both regular and reverse video.)  The following is an example of a
       very small pixmap file (in XPM1 format).

              #define arrow_format 1
              #define arrow_width 5
              #define arrow_height 3
              #define arrow_ncolors 3
              #define arrow_chars_per_pixel 1
              static char *arrow_colors[] = {
                 "`", "Black",
                 "a", "red",
                 "b", "yellow"
              };
              static char *arrow_pixels[] = {
              "`a```",
              "aabbb",
              "`a```"
              };

LATEX FIGURE FORMATS
       Here we show how to make a figure for a LaTeX file, first with the
       \psfig (or \epsf) special construct, then with the psfile special
       construct.  (The author does not recommend the psfile construct.)  An
       example of both can be found in ``example.tex'' which is included with
       the tgif distribution.

       To print a tgif file to be included in a LaTeX document with the \psfig
       or \epsf special construct (files generated will be in the Encapsulated
       PostScript format), first select LaTeX format in the panel window
       (click the left mouse button on the laser printer icon), then type ^p
       to generate the Encapsulated PostScript file.  If the file name is
       ``an-sr-flip-flop.obj'', then the LaTeX figure file generated will be
       named ``an-sr-flip-flop.eps''.  This file can be included in a LaTeX
       document as follows,

              \input{psfig}
              \begin{figure*}[htb]
              \centerline{\psfig{figure=an-sr-flip-flop.eps}}
              \caption{An SR flip-flop.  \label{fig:an-sr-flip-flop}}
              \end{figure*}

       An alternative way is to use the \epsf construct as follows,

              \input{epsf}
              \begin{figure*}[htb]
              \centerline{\epsffile{an-sr-flip-flop.eps}}
              \caption{An SR flip-flop.  \label{fig:an-sr-flip-flop}}
              \end{figure*}

       The \centerline command above centers the picture.  If one has multiple
       tgif figures in one's LaTeX document, one only have to include the
       psfig macro (\input{psfig} or \input{epsf}) once, right after the
       \begin{document} statement.

       If Encapsulated PostScript is not available, the psfile special
       construct can be used as described here.  In this case, since LaTeX
       doesn't not know where the bounding box of the drawing is, it takes
       some practice to get this just right.  Here is something that seems to
       work.  First, center the picture on the page (e.g., the width of a
       portrait style page is 8.5 inch, so the center of the page is at the
       4.25 inch mark), and make the top object in the picture about 1/4 inch
       away from the top of the page.  Select the LaTeX format in the panel
       window, then print in the LaTeX format.  As with the psfig construct, a
       file with the .eps extension will be generated.  This file can be
       included in a LaTeX document as follows,

              \begin{figure*}[htb]
              \special{psfile="an-sr-flip-flop.eps" hoffset=-40}
              \rule{0in}{1.1in}
              \caption{An SR flip-flop.  \label{fig:an-sr-flip-flop}}
              \end{figure*}

       The \rule{0in}{1.1in} above specifies an invisible box of 1.1 inches
       high, which is the total height of the picture in an-sr-flip-flop.

CONNECTING OBJECTS
       In the world of E-CAD, an icon object can represent an electronic
       component and a line object can represent a connection between a pair
       of pins of two electronic components.  When a component moves, the
       endpoint of a wire connecting to the component will also move with the
       component.  Tgif simulates these functionalities in a limited fashion.

       In tgif, a connection is represented by matching signal names.  A wire
       is defined as a polyline object having a type=tgWire attribute and an
       attribute named signal_name.  The definition of a pin is more
       complicated.  It is described in the next paragraph.  If two pins have
       identical values for the signal_name attribute, they are considered to
       be connected (they do not have to be visually connected by a wire).

       A pin object must have a type=port attribute and attributes named
       signal_name and name.  But not all objects having such attributes are
       pins.  In addition, a pin object must be either:

       (1)    a top-level symbol or an icon object

       or:

       (2)    an immediate subobject of a owner symbol or icon object.  or:

       (3)    an immediate subobject of a owner grouped object which has a
              type=tgBroadcastWire attribute.

       In (2) above, the owner object must also have an attribute named name
       and must not be a subobject of another symbol or icon object.  If the
       owner object is a subobject of a grouped object, the name attributes of
       the grouped object will be ignored.

       In (3) above, that grouped object can be created using the
       ConnectPortsToBroadcastWire() command in the PortsAndSignals submenu of
       the Special Menu when a polyline object and some floating port objects
       are selected.

       A pin object can have a connected view and a disconnected view.  A
       connected view is a subobject with a view=conn,FILL,PEN attribute and a
       disconnected view is a subobject with a view=disconn,FILL,PEN
       attribute; FILL and PEN are numeric values between 0 and 31
       (inclusive).  The value corresponds to patterns in the Fill Menu and
       the Pen Menu.  Normally, only 0 or 1 should be used.  When the
       signal_name attribute of a pin object is changed from an empty string
       to a non-empty string, the pen and fill of the subobject that
       corresponds to the disconnected view will be set to 0 (meaning NONE)
       and the pen and fill of the subobject that corresponds to the connected
       view will be set to the values specified in the view attribute of the
       connected view.  When the signal_name attribute of a pin object is
       changed from a non-empty string to an empty string, the pen and fill of
       the subobject that corresponds to the connected view will be set to 0
       and the pen and fill of the subobject that corresponds to the
       disconnected view will be set to the values specified in the view
       attribute of the disconnected view.

       A connection can be created using the ConnectTwoPortsByAWire() command
       from the PortsAndSignals submenu of the Special Menu.  Please note that
       if a pin is part of another object, that object must also have a name
       attribute with a non-empty value.  When two pins are connected using
       this command, the signal_name attributes of the pins and the wire will
       be set to have the same value.

       The moving of endpoints when a component moves is implemented in tgif
       using the constrained move mode from the MoveMode Menu (please see
       Tgif.ConstrainedMove in the X DEFAULTS section for additional
       information).  Please note that a connected wire that is not visually
       connected will not automatically extends itself to follow a connected
       component even in the constrained move mode.  Also, when a wire object
       is deleted, the signal_name attributes of connected pins do not change
       (since they are not really "connected").

X DEFAULTS
       Tgif.Geometry: WIDTHxHEIGHT+X+Y

       Tgif.IconGeometry: +X+Y

       Tgif.Foreground: COLORSTRING
              The default foreground color is Black.

       Tgif.Background: COLORSTRING
              The default background color is White.

       Tgif.BorderColor: COLORSTRING
              If not specified, the foreground color will be used.

       Tgif.ReverseVideo: [on,off]
              For black and white terminal, reverse video ``on'' means the
              background is black.  For color terminal, reverse video ``on''
              means the background is specified by the Tgif.Foreground color.
              The default is off.

       Tgif.InitialFont: [Times,Courier,Helvetica,NewCentury,Symbol]
              This specifies the initial font.  The default is Courier.

       Tgif.InitialFontStyle: [Roman,Bold,Italic,BoldItalic]
              This specifies the initial font style.  The default is Roman.

       Tgif.InitialFontJust: [Left,Center,Right]
              This specifies the initial font justification.  The default is
              Left.

       Tgif.InitialFontDPI: [75,100]
              Obsoleted.

       Tgif.InitialFontSizeIndex: [0,1,2,3,4,5]
              Obsoleted.

       Tgif.InitialFontSize: NUMBER
              This specifies the size of the start-up font.  The default is
              14.  An alternative form allows "pt" to be specified immediately
              after NUMBER (with no space between "pt" and the NUMBER).

       Tgif.MsgFontSizeIndex: [0,1,2,3,4,5]
              Obsoleted.

       Tgif.MsgFontSize: NUMBER
              This specifies the size of the font used for messages, menues,
              and popup windows.  The default is 14.

       Tgif.RulerFontSize: NUMBER
              This specifies the size of the font used for ruler windows.  The
              default is 10.

       Tgif.DefaultFontSize: NUMBER
              This specifies the size of the font to be used when a requested
              for a font size can not satisfied.  This size must exist for all
              fonts used in tgif.  The default is 14.

       Tgif.FontSizes: NUMBER1 NUMBER2, ...
              This specified the font sizes.  The default is 8 10 11 12 14 17
              18 20 24 25 34.  An alternative form allows "pt" to be specified
              immediately after a NUMBER (with no space between "pt" the the
              NUMBER).  Please also use Tgif.InitialFontSize to specify the
              initial font size to use if 14 is not in the specified font
              sizes.

       Tgif.AdditionalFonts: FONT_SPEC1 FONT_SPEC2 ...
              In addition to the Times, Courier, Helvetica, NewCentury, and
              Symbol fonts, additional fonts can be specified here.  Please
              see the ADDITIONAL FONTS section for details.

       Tgif.FontNamePrefix: [-*, *]
              This specified the prefix to be used when tgif makes a request
              to the X server.  The default is -*.  Certain fonts have obscure
              font names (e.g., does not start with the - character).  In
              order to use these fonts, this X default can be set to *.

       Tgif.DefaultLatin1FontCharEncoding: STRING
              Tgif uses 4 default fonts, "times", "courier", "helvetica", and
              "new century schoolbook".  By default, the character encoding
              for these fonts is iso8859-1.  These fonts are usually scalable
              and pre-installed in older Linux systems.  In newer Linux
              system, this is no longer the case.  Only a small number of font
              sizes are pre-installed.  The pre-installed scalable versions of
              these fonts are iso10646-1 (Universal Character Set) encoded.
              This X default can be used to specify a different character
              encoding (such as iso10646-1) for the 4 default fonts.  This X
              default does not apply to alternate default fonts or fonts
              specified by the Tgif.AdditionalFonts X default.  The default is
              iso8859-1.

       Tgif.HasAlternateDefaultFonts: [true,false]
              The default value of this X default is false.  If it is set to
              ``false'', tgif uses the iso8859 registry with ASN1 encoded
              screen fonts (unless it's overridden by the
              Tgif.DefaultFontCharEncoding X default), and it looks for
              "times", "courier", "helvetica", "new century schoolbook", and
              "symbol" as part of the screen font names.  Some X servers do
              not support these fonts.  In this case, this X default can be
              used to make tgif use user specified screen and PostScript
              fonts.  If this X default is set to ``true'', tgif will look for
              additional X defaults of the form Tgif.<ps_font_name>, where
              <ps_font_name> can be one of the following strings:

                     Times-Roman
                     Times-Bold
                     Times-Italic
                     Times-BoldItalic
                     Courier
                     Courier-Bold
                     Courier-Oblique
                     Courier-BoldOblique
                     Helvetica
                     Helvetica-Bold
                     Helvetica-Oblique
                     Helvetica-BoldOblique
                     NewCenturySchlbk-Roman
                     NewCenturySchlbk-Bold
                     NewCenturySchlbk-Italic
                     NewCenturySchlbk-BoldItalic
                     Symbol

              The corresponding value of the X default must contain "%d" as
              part of the string, and the "%d" string will be replaced by the
              font size when the font is requested.  For example, The
              following lines will use the Times New Roman screen font instead
              of the Times screen font and use the Bookman PostScript font
              instead of the Times PostScript font, if
              Tgif.HasAlternateDefaultFonts is ``true'':

              Tgif.Times-Roman: *-times new roman-medium-r-*--%d-*,Bookman-
              Light
              Tgif.Times-Bold: *-times new roman-bold-r-*--%d-*,Bookman-Demi
              Tgif.Times-Italic: *-times new roman-medium-i-*--%d-*,Bookman-
              LightItalic
              Tgif.Times-BoldItalic: *-times new roman-bold-i-*--%d-*,Bookman-
              DemiItalic

              Please note that certain X servers require the right-hand-side
              font specifications to have all the dashes in place.

       Tgif.DefaultCursor: [x_cursor,arrow,...]
              This specifies the select cursor.  Entries in <X11/cursorfont.h>
              (without the XC_ prefix) are valid names of the cursor.  The
              default is arrow.

       Tgif.DrawCursor: [x_cursor,arrow,...]
              This specifies the cursor used when drawing objects.  Entries in
              <X11/cursorfont.h> (without the XC_ prefix) are valid names of
              the cursor.  The default is the same as Tgif.DefaultCursor.

       Tgif.DragCursor: [x_cursor,arrow,...]
              This specifies the cursor used when dragging.  Entries in
              <X11/cursorfont.h> (without the XC_ prefix) are valid names of
              the cursor.  The default is hand2.

       Tgif.VertexCursor: [x_cursor,arrow,...]
              This specifies the cursor used in the select vertices mode.
              Entries in <X11/cursorfont.h> (without the XC_ prefix) are valid
              names of the cursor.  The default is plus.

       Tgif.FreeHandCursor: [x_cursor,arrow,...]
              This specifies the cursor used in freehand drawing mode.
              Entries in <X11/cursorfont.h> (without the XC_ prefix) are valid
              names of the cursor.  The default is pencil.

       Tgif.RubberBandColor: COLORSTRING
              This specifies the color to be used for rubber-banding (XORing).
              The default color is the same as the foreground color.

       Tgif.MaxColors: NUMBER
              This specifies the maximum number of colors.  Color0 through
              ColorMax, where Max is NUMBER-1, in X defaults are queried.  If
              NUMBER is greater than the default of 11, Color11 through
              ColorMax must all exist in X defaults.  Please see the GRAPHICAL
              OBJECTS section for a list of the default colors.

       Tgif.Color#: COLORSTRING
              This specifies the correspondence between a color number and a
              color.

       Tgif.DefaultColorIndex: NUMBER
              This specifies the default color index if a certain color can
              not be found.  The default is 0.  Please note Tgif.DefaultColor
              takes precedence over this X default.

       Tgif.ShortCuts: ITEM1 ITEM2 ...
              The ITEM specifies the correspondence between a key (may be case
              sensitive) and a non-alphanumeric key command.  Please see the
              SHORTCUTS section for details.

       Tgif.MaxLineWidths: NUMBER
              This specifies the maximum number of line widths.  LineWidth0
              through LineWidthMax, ArrowWidth0 through ArrowWidthMax, and
              ArrowHeight0 through ArrowHeightMax, where Max is NUMBER-1, in X
              defaults are queried.  If NUMBER is greater than the default
              value of 7, LineWidth7 through LineWidthMax, ArrowWidth7 through
              ArrowWidthMax, and ArrowHeight7 through ArrowHeightMax must all
              exist in X defaults.  Some default values will be used for those
              that are not specified in the X defaults.

       Tgif.DefaultLineWidth: NUMBER
              This specifies the initial line width index.  The default is 0.

       Tgif.LineWidth#: NUMBER
              This specifies a line width.  The default line widths are 1, 2,
              3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

       Tgif.ArrowWidth#: NUMBER
              This specifies the width (when the arrow is pointing
              horizontally) of the arrow head for arc and open-spline objects.
              The default arrow widths are 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 20, and 22.

       Tgif.ArrowHeight#: NUMBER
              This specifies half the height (when the arrow is also pointing
              horizontally) of the arrow head for arc and open-spline objects.
              The default arrow heights are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

       Tgif.MaxDomains: NUMBER
              This specifies that NUMBER is the number of domains.
              DomainPath0,DomainPath1,...,DomainPathM all must exist in X
              defaults.  Here M=NUMBER-1.

       Tgif.DomainPath#: DOMAINSTRING
              This specifies the correspondence between a domain number, a
              domain name, and the path associated with a domain.  Hence one
              DomainPath# X default is required for each domain defined.  Here
              the # should be replaced with a domain number.  The domain
              numbers should be 0,1,...,MAXDOMAINS-1, where MAXDOMAINS is set
              in the MaxDomain X default above.  The MaxDomain X default in
              combination with the DomainPath# X default are required to use
              domains.

              DOMAINSTRING contains strings which are separated by the ':'
              symbol.  The first string is the name of the domain.  Each of
              the rest of the strings specifies a directory where symbol files
              are to be searched when the Instantiate command is executed
              (please see the HOW TO MAKE A BUILDING-BLOCK OBJECT section for
              details).  Another way to look at the DOMAINSTRING specification
              is that removing the first string (which specifies the domain
              name) and the first ':' symbol, a DOMAINSTRING has the form of
              the PATH csh(1) environment variable.  For example, to specify
              the symbol path for domain DEFAULT to look for symbol files,
              first in the library directory /tmp/tgif/symbols, then in the
              current directory, DOMAINSTRING should be set to the following
              value:

                     DEFAULT:/tmp/tgif/symbols:.

       Tgif.DefaultDomain: NUMBER
              This specifies the default domain when tgif starts up.  The
              default is 0.

       Tgif.PrintCommand: COMMAND
              This specifies the print command used for printing the
              PostScript file.  The default is lpr(1).  An example would be
              lpr -h -Pprintername.  If COMMAND contains a %s substring, the
              %s will be replaced by the full path name of the PostScript file
              which is normally sent to the print command.  Therefore, COMMAND
              without a %s substring behaves identically to COMMAND %s.
              Please note that this only works when running tgif without the
              -print command line option.  This can be used to send a font
              file to the printer before the tgif PostScript file is sent as
              in the following example:

                     cat /somewhere/sansfex.pfa %s | lpr -Pmyprinter

       Tgif.WhereToPrint: STRING
              This specifies the initial print/export destination/format.
              STRING can be Printer, EPS, PS, Bitmap, Text, EPSI, GIF, HTML,
              PDF, WinEPSI, PNG, JPEG, PPM, or NetList.  The default is EPS.

       Tgif.PrintDirectory: PATH
              This specifies the print directory when the output destination
              is not the printer.  The default is a null string, which means
              that the output goes into the directory in which the current
              file resides.

       Tgif.NoTgifIcon: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', tgif will not use its own icon window.  In
              this case, one should also set Tgif.UseWMIconPixmap described
              below to true.  Modern window managers usually do not allow an
              application to draw its own icon window, so this X default would
              have no effect when tgif is running under these window managers.
              The default is false.

       Tgif.UseWMIconPixmap: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', tgif will use the standard icon pixmap.
              Also, Tgif.NoTgifIcon will be ignored.  The default is true.

       Tgif.DontShowVersion: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', the tgif version will not be displayed on
              top of the tgif window.  The default is true.

       Tgif.XBmReverseVideo: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', an invert bitmap operation will be performed
              when importing an X11 bitmap file.  The default is false.

       Tgif.AskForXBmSpec: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', the user will be asked to specify
              magnification and geometry for an X11 bitmap file being
              imported.  Format of the specification is MAG=WxH+X+Y, where MAG
              is the magnification, W and H specifies the width and height,
              and the location specification can be +X+Y, +X-Y, -X+Y, and -X-
              Y.  The '=' is mandatory if any of the geometry information is
              specified.  The default is false.

       Tgif.AskForXPmSpec: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', the user will be asked to specify
              magnification and geometry for an X11 pixmap file being
              imported.  The format of the specification is the same as for
              AskForXBmSpec.  The default is false.

       Tgif.StripEPSComments: (obsolete)
              This X default became obsolete in tgif-4.0.11 because it turns
              out that it's not always okay to strip PS comments (it should
              always be set to false).

       Tgif.GuessXPmBgColor: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', then when tgif imports an X11 pixmap file
              with the first color string being ' ' (the space character) or
              '`' (the back quote character), it will treat the first color as
              a background color.  This means that the specified color in the
              X11 pixmap file will be changed to the current background color.
              The default is false.  (Please note that this default was true
              before patch 2 of tgif-2.7.  This X default is there for
              compatibility reasons; it should be considered obsolete.)

       Tgif.XPmOutputVersion: NUMBER
              This specifies the XPM version number when outputting in the X11
              pixmap format.  NUMBER can take on values 1 or 3.  The default
              is 1.

       Tgif.XPmInXGrabSCFormat: [true,false]
              If Tgif.XpmOutputVersion is set to 1, setting this to ``true''
              will force the X11 pixmap output to resemble what xgrabsc
              generates (i.e., color names will not be used).  The default is
              false.

       Tgif.UseGrayScale: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', gray scales will be used for tiling patterns
              to speed up printing.  The default is false.

       Tgif.AutoPanInEditText: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', auto panning will be used such that the text
              cursor is always visible in text edit mode (except when the
              cursor is to the left or on top of the paper).  This should
              probably be turned off on slow servers.  The default is true.

       Tgif.PercentPrintReduction: NUMBER
              This specifies the initial percent print
              reduction/magnification.  The default is 100.

       Tgif.ConstrainedMove: [true,false]
              This specifies the initial move mode.  When set to ``true'',
              moving or stretching an object will cause the endpoints of all
              polylines or open-splines, whose endpoints fall within the
              object, and may be the neighboring vertices, to be moved.
              Please see the IDIOSYNCRASIES section for more details.  The
              default value is false.

       Tgif.DoubleQuoteDoubleQuote: [true,false]
              When set to ``true'', output of the double-quote character will
              be preceded by a double-quote character; when set to false,
              output of the double-quote character will be preceded by a back-
              slash character.  The default value is false.

       Tgif.GridSystem: [English,Metric]
              This sets the initial grid system.  The default is English.

       Tgif.InitialGrid: NUMBER
              This specifies the initial grid size.  For the English grid
              system, NUMBER can be -2, -1, 0, +1, or +2 for grid sizes of
              1/32, 1/16, 1/8, 1/4, and 1/2 inch.  For the Metric grid system,
              NUMBER can be -1, 0, +1, or +2 for grid sizes of 1mm, 2mm, 5mm,
              and 1cm.  The default value is 0.

       Tgif.DropObsIconAttrWhenUpdate: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', obsolete icon attributes will be dropped
              without confirmation when the UpdateSymbols command is executed.
              If set to ``false'', a popup window will prompt the user to
              specify what to do with the obsoleted icon attributes.  The
              default is false.

       Tgif.UseRecentDupDistance: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', the most recent change in position produced
              by a combination of a duplicate and a move command will be used
              for the new duplicate command.  Otherwise, some default distance
              will be used to position the duplicate.  The default is true.

       Tgif.SplineTolerance: NUMBER
              This specifies the tolerance of spline drawing.  The smaller the
              number, the smoother the spline.  The default is 9 (min is 3 and
              max is 13).

       Tgif.SplineRubberband: (obsolete)
              If set to ``true'', spline rubber-bands will be used in drawing,
              moving, and stretching open and closed splines.  (This might not
              be desirable if the spline contains too many vertices.)  The
              default is true.  This X default became obsolete since tgif-4.2
              due to the addition of structured spline objects.

       Tgif.Synchronize: [on,off]
              XSynchronize is called if this X default is set to ``on''.  The
              default is off.

       Tgif.DoubleClickUnIconify: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', double mouse clicks are used to de-iconify
              the icon window (in this mode, the icon window ignores single
              mouse clicks and drags).  The default is false.

       Tgif.MainMenuPinDistance: NUMBER
              This specifies the horizontal distance (in pixels) the user
              needs to drag a popup menu before the popup menu is to be pinned
              down.  The default is 80.  (If pinned popup menus are not
              desired, then this should be set to a value greater than the
              screen width.)  Dragging the left mouse button can be used to
              move the pinned popup menu; clicking the right button in the
              popup menu will remove it.

       Tgif.DoubleClickInterval: NUMBER
              This specifies the maximum interval (in milliseconds) between
              two mouse clicked to be recognized as one double-click.  The
              default is 300.

       Tgif.HandleSize: NUMBER
              This specifies (half) the size of the handle used to highlight
              objects.  Its allowable value is between 2 and 6.  The default
              is 3.

       Tgif.HistoryDepth: NUMBER
              This specifies the size of the undo/redo buffer; negative values
              mean that the buffer is unbounded.  The default is -1.

       Tgif.SaveTmpOnReturn: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', a tmpmodel file will be saved automatically
              before returning to the driver.  Otherwise, no files will be
              saved automatically.  The default is true.

       Tgif.ImportFromLibrary: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', the library directories specified by the
              current domain are searched for .obj, .sym, xbitmap/xpixmap, and
              EPS files to import.  Otherwise, the current directory will be
              used as the starting point.  The default is false.

       Tgif.WarpToWinCenter: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', the mouse is warped to the center of popup
              windows.  Otherwise, the mouse is not warped.  The default is
              true.

       Tgif.SaveCommentsInSaveNew: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', "%%" type comments in the file will be
              stored in the newly created file.  The default is true.

       Tgif.CanvasWindowOnly: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', only the canvas window will be displayed
              (this is a kind of the ``demo'' mode).  The default is false.

       Tgif.UsePsAdobeString: [true,false,NUMBER_1/NUMBER_2]
              If set to ``true'', the first line in the PS or EPS file will be
              "%!PS-Adobe-2.0 EPSF-1.2".  If set to ``false'', it is just
              "%!".  If the PS-Adobe string confuses the document manager
              (such as Transcript) on your site, you should set it to
              ``false''.  If the third form is used, the first line will be
              "%!PS-Adobe-NUMBER_1 EPSF-NUMBER_2".  The default is false.

       Tgif.HalfToneBitmap: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', the Floyd-Steinberg half-tone method will be
              used when printing in the X11 bitmap format.  This is useful
              when the drawing contains X11 pixmap objects.  The default is
              false.

       Tgif.ThresholdBitmap: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', a simple thresholding method will be used to
              decide whether a bit is turned on or off when printing in the
              X11 bitmap format.  If Tgif.HalfToneBitmap is set to true, this
              X default is ignored.  The default is false.

       Tgif.BitmapThreshold: NUMBER
              This specifies the threshold value used in either the Floyd-
              Steinberg half-tone algorithm or the simple thresholding
              algorithm.  NUMBER must be between 0 and 1.  This X default is
              only active when either the Tgif.HalfToneBitmap or the
              Tgif.ThresholdBitmap X default is set to true.  The default
              value is 0.5 if Tgif.HalfToneBitmap is true, and is 1.0 if
              Tgif.ThresholdBitmap is true (basically, anything that is not
              white will be black).

       Tgif.EPSIThresholdPreviewBitmap: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', a simple thresholding method will be used to
              decide whether a bit is turned on or off in the preview bitmap
              when printing in the EPSI format.  The default is false.

       Tgif.EPSIPreviewBitmapThreshold: NUMBER
              This specifies the threshold value used in the simple
              thresholding algorithm to decide whether a bit is turned on or
              off in the preview bitmap when printing in the EPSI format.
              NUMBER must be between 0 and 1.  The default value is 0.5 if
              Tgif.EPSIThresholdPreviewBitmap is true, and is 1.0 if
              Tgif.EPSIThresholdPreviewBitmap is false (basically, anything
              that is not white will be black).

       Tgif.GroupedTextEditable: [true,false]
              If set to ``false'', only top level text objects and attributes
              of top level objects can be edited when the drawing mode is set
              to the text mode.  If set to ``true'', text objects and
              attributes everywhere can be edited.  The default is false.

       Tgif.DefaultEPSScaling: NUMBER
              This specifies the scaling factor applied to an imported PS or
              EPS image.  As mentioned in the IDIOSYNCRASIES section below,
              tgif treats 128 pixels as an inch and PostScript treats 72
              points as an inch.  In order to have real-size PostScript
              images, this parameter should be set to 1.7778 (which is
              128/72).  The default value is 1.

       Tgif.IntrCheckInterval: NUMBER
              This specifies the number of objects drawn before tgif checks
              for interrupts.  If this is set to be 0 or less, interrupt is
              not allowed.  The default value is 10.

       Tgif.TiledPageScaling: NUMBER
              This specifies the scaling value used when a multipage drawing
              in tiled page mode is printed.  Since most PostScript printers
              do not use the full page as the drawing area, setting this
              number to 1 may get truncated output.  The default value is 0.9.

       Tgif.TGIFPATH: STRING
              This specifies the directory where the files, mentioned in the
              FILES section below, can be found.  The TGIFPATH environment
              variable may override this option.  The default value is
              specified by the compiler option TGIF_PATH.

       Tgif.TGIFICON: STRING
              This specifies the name of the object file to be displayed when
              tgif is iconified.  If it starts with a / character, absolute
              path is used; otherwise, the actual path of the icon file is
              $TGIFPATH/STRING where TGIFPATH is either defined using the X
              defaults or an environment variable.  The default value is
              ``tgificon.obj''.

       Tgif.StickyMenuSelection: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', when patterns/linewidths/linestyles/... of
              objects are changed using a menu action, the corresponding
              pattern/linewidth/linestyle/... becomes the current selection.
              The default is true.

       Tgif.PSBopHook: STRING
              If specified, the following PostScript line is added at the
              beginning of each page when printing to the printer or to a PS
              file,

                     userdict /STRING known { STRING } if

              This option should only be used if one is very familiar with
              PostScript.  (Setting STRING to "tgif-bop-hook" is recommended
              since it would not have a name conflict with existing software,
              such as dvips(1).)

       Tgif.PSEopHook: STRING
              If specified, the following PostScript line is added at the end
              of each page when printing to the printer or to a PS file,

                     userdict /STRING known { STRING } if

              This option should only be used if one is very familiar with
              PostScript.  (Setting STRING to "tgif-eop-hook" is recommended
              since it would not have a name conflict with existing software,
              such as dvips(1).)

       Tgif.MinimalEPS: [true,false]
              If set to ``false'', comments such as %%Pages, %%DocumentFonts,
              %%EndComments, %%BeginProlog, %%EndProlog, %%Page, %%Trailer,
              and %%EOF will be generated in an EPS output.  These comments
              may confuse certain ``document managers''.  Therefore, the
              default is true if Tgif.UsePsAdobeString is not specified (and
              the default is false if Tgif.UsePsAdobeString is specified).

       Tgif.InitialPrintInColor: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', color output (printing) mode is enabled on
              startup.  Please note that in black and white PS/EPS/EPSI
              printing mode, the white color will be printed as black (only
              background will be printed as white).  The default is true
              (except when the -print command line option is used).

       Tgif.InitialShowGrid: [true,false]
              If set to ``false'', showing grid is disabled on startup.  The
              default is true.

       Tgif.InitialSnapOn: [true,false]
              If set to ``false'', snapping to the grid points is disabled on
              startup.  The default is true.

       Tgif.NoMenubar: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', no menubar will be shown initially.  The
              default is false.

       Tgif.NoStatusWindow: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', no Status Window will be shown initially.
              The default is false.

       Tgif.ReverseMouseStatusButtons: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', the left mouse status and the right mouse
              status are swapped.  This should be used when a ``left-handed
              mouse'' is used.  The default is false.

       Tgif.MinimalMenubar: [true,false]
              If set to ``false'', the menu items in the Menubar Window will
              be the same as the main popup menu.  This would take up much
              more space.  If set to ``true'', the Page, PageLayout,
              HoriAlign, VertAlign, and MoveMode menus are collapsed into the
              View cascading menu; the Font, TextStyle, and TextSize menus are
              collapsed into the Text cascading menu; and the LineDash,
              LineStyle, LineType, LineWidth, Fill, and Pen menus are
              collapsed into the Graphics cascading menu.  The default is
              true.

       Tgif.ColorBgInPrintingColorPS: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', the window background color is used as the
              background color when generating color PostScript output.  If
              set to ``false'', no background color is used.  The default is
              false.

       Tgif.ScrollBarWidth: NUMBER
              This specifies the width of a scroll bar.  NUMBER must be
              between 2 and 16.  The default is 16.

       Tgif.InitialPaperSize: STRING
              The STRING specifies the initial width and height of the paper.
              STRING is in the "<width> x <height>" form.  <width> and
              <height> is a numeric value immediately followed by either "in"
              (inch) or "cm" (centi-meter).  The " x " that separate the
              <width> and <height> is mandatory.  If A4PAPER is defined in the
              Makefile, the default value is "21cm x 29.7cm".  If A4PAPER is
              not defined in the Makefile, the default value is "8.5in x
              11in".

       Tgif.UpdateChildUsingAlignment: [true,false,no_overlap]
              If set to ``true'' or 'no_overlap', when update_eps_child(),
              update_xbm_child(), or update_xpm_child() internal command is
              executed, the current horizontal and vertical alignments are
              used to place the EPS/XBM/XPM subobject.  If the horizontal
              alignment is L, C, R, S, or -, the subobject is aligned to the
              left, center, right, center, or left, respectively, to the
              parent object.  If the vertical alignment is T, M, B, S, or -,
              the subobject is placed above, middle, below, middle, or below
              the parent object if this X default is set to 'no_overlap'; the
              subobject is aligned to the top, middle, bottom, middle, or
              below the parent object if this X default is set to ``true''.
              If this X default is set to ``false'', the subobject is placed
              left aligned and below the parent object.  The default is false.

       Tgif.GenerateImageMap: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', NCSA imagemap or CERN Clickable Image files
              will be generated when print in GIF format.  In this case,
              Tgif.XpmToGif, Tgif.ImageMapFileExtension,
              Tgif.GifFileExtension, Tgif.ImageMapFileFormat, and
              Tgif.UseXPmVersion1ForImageMap X defaults, described below, will
              be interpreted; otherwise, they are ignored.  Please see the
              section on GENERATING IMAGEMAP FILES for details.  The default
              is false.

       Tgif.XpmToGif: STRING
              The STRING specifies a command used to convert an XPM file to a
              GIF file.  The STRING must contain a %s substring to be replaced
              by the full path name of the XPM file.  The default is "xpmtoppm
              %s | ppmtogif".

       Tgif.ImageMapFileExtension: STRING
              The STRING specifies the file extension for a imagemap file.
              The default is "map".

       Tgif.GifFileExtension: STRING
              The STRING specifies the file extension for a GIF file.  The
              default is "gif" (lower case).

       Tgif.ImageMapFileFormat: [NCSA,CERN]
              The STRING specifies either the NCSA imagemap or the CERN
              clickable image format.  The default is NCSA for the NCSA
              imagemap format.

       Tgif.UseXPmVersion1ForImageMap: [true,false]
              The setting of this X default should depend on the setting of
              the Tgif.XpmToGif X default above.  If set to ``true'', XPM1
              file is generated regardless of the setting of the
              Tgif.XPmOutputVersion X default.  The default is true.

       Tgif.UsePaperSizeStoredInFile: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', the paper size information stored in a just
              opened file is used.  The default is true.

       Tgif.OneMotionSelMove: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', one can select and move an object in one
              motion.  The default is false.

       Tgif.TiffEPSI: (obsolete)
              This X default became obsolete because TiffEPSI became a
              supported export format since tgif-4.0.

       Tgif.XbmToTiff: STRING
              The STRING specifies a command used to convert an XBM file to a
              TIFF file.  The STRING must contain either one or two %s
              substring.  The first %s substring is to be replaced by the full
              path name of the XBM file.  The optional second %s substring is
              to be replaced by the full path name of the generated TIFF
              image.  The default is "xbmtopbm %s | pnmtotiff -none > %s".

       Tgif.EPSIExportExtension: STRING
              STRING specifies the file extension used for exporting EPSI
              files.  The default is "eps".

       Tgif.HotListFileName: STRING
              STRING specifies a full path name of a file used to store the
              hot file list.  By default, this file is .Tgif_hotlist in the
              user's home directory.

       Tgif.@@@Viewer: STRING
              STRING specifies an external viewer for an remote URL with a
              file extension of @@@.  STRING can be in 3 forms.  It can be the
              string "NONE" to indicate that when such a remote file is
              encountered, tgif should retrieve the file into a user specified
              directory.  For example, if one wishes to retrieve .gz files,
              one can use:

                     Tgif.gzViewer: NONE

              STRING can also contain the string %S (S is capitalized), this
              indicates that %S is to be replaced by the URL.  For example, if
              one wishes to view .html files using xmosaic, one can use:

                     Tgif.htmlViewer: xmosaic %S

              Another form of STRING contains the string %s (S is lower-case),
              this indicates that the remote file is to be retrieved into a
              user specified directory and view by a tool.  For example, if
              one wishes to view .gif files using xv, one can use:

                     Tgif.gifViewer: xv %s

              Please note that this mechanism has precedence over the
              mechanism described in the MIME TYPES AND MAILCAPS section
              above.

       Tgif.AutoHyperSpaceOnRemote: [true,false]
              If set to ``false'', tgif will not go into the hyperspace mode
              when a remote URL is visited.  The default is true.

       Tgif.AllowLaunchInHyperSpace: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', launching of applications is enabled in the
              hyperspace mode when a remote URL is visited.  This is
              potentially very dangerous because the application may do
              catastrophic damages.  Therefore, it is strongly recommended
              that it is set to false.  The default is false.

       Tgif.CanChangeAttrColor: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', color of an attribute can be changed when it
              is attached to an object.  The default is false.

       Tgif.MimeTypesFile: STRING
              STRING specifies a full path name of the MIME-types file.  Tgif
              only uses the type/subtype field in the MIME-types file and
              ignores all other fields.  The default MIME-types file is
              .mime.types in user's home directory.

       Tgif.LocalRGBTxt: STRING
              If one would like to override certain system colors, one can use
              STRING to specify a full path name of a file to be consulted
              first before looking up the color in the server.  The file must
              be in the same format as the rgb.txt file.  Namely, each line
              contains 4 fields, the first 3 fields correspond to the red,
              green, and blue components of the color, and the 4th field is
              the name of the color.  A color component must have a value
              between 0 and 255 (inclusive).

       Tgif.PrintUsingRequestedColor: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', the color PostScript file being printed will
              use the requested color instead of the color returned by the X
              server.  The default is false.

       Tgif.ShowMeasurement: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', the location of the cursor and the width and
              height of the object being drawn/dragged/stretched will be
              shown.  The default is false.

       Tgif.ShowMeasurementUnit: STRING
              The STRING specifies the unit used to display the measurement
              cursor.  There are 2 basic formats.  One is just the word
              "pixel", "inch", or "cm".  There are also known as basic units.
              Another format is NUM BASIC-UNIT/NEW-UNIT, where NUM is a
              numeric value, BASIC-UNIT is one of the basic units, and NEW-
              UNIT is any string.  For example, "0.1 cm/mm" means that the new
              display unit is "mm" and 1 "mm" is 0.1 cm.  "50 pixel/cm" is
              identical to "1 cm/cm" and "128 pixel/inch" is identical to "1
              inch/inch".  The default is pixel.

       Tgif.PageStyleLandscape: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', tgif comes up in landscape mode.  The
              default is false.

       Tgif.QueryZoomInPoint: [true,false] or
       [always,no_select,no_query,never]
              If set to ``true'' (or ``always''), the user will be asked to
              select a center point when zooming in.  If set to ``no_select'',
              the user will be asked to select a center point when zooming in
              if no objects are selected.  If set to ``no_query'', the
              position of the mouse is the zoom-in point.  In this case, it is
              not desirable to zooms in using a menu selection.  The default
              is false (or never).

       Tgif.GZipCmd: STRING
              The STRING specifies a command used to gzip a .obj file.  The
              command must produce output into its stdout.  If the command
              contains a %s substring, the %s will be replace by the full path
              name of a temporary copy of the .obj file.  The default is "gzip
              -c".

       Tgif.GUnZipCmd: STRING
              The STRING specifies a command used to unzip a zipped tgif file
              (with extension .obj.gz or .sym.gz) into a tgif file.  The
              command must produce output into its stdout.  If the command
              contains a %s substring, the %s will be replace by the full path
              name of a temporary copy of the zipped file.  The default is
              "gunzip -c".

       Tgif.HttpProxy: STRING
              The STRING specifies a host name and a port number of an HTTP
              proxy server.  Format of the specification is <host>:<port>.  If
              :<port> is omitted, 80 is used as the default port number.  The
              environment variable http_proxy has precedence over this X
              default.  The default is not to use an HTTP proxy server.

       Tgif.FtpProxy: STRING
              The STRING specifies a host name and a port number of an FTP
              proxy server.  Format of the specification is <host>:<port>.  If
              :<port> is omitted, 21 is used as the default port number.  The
              environment variable ftp_proxy has precedence over this X
              default.  The default is not to use an FTP proxy server.

       Tgif.InitialArrowStyle: [NONE,RIGHT,LEFT,DOUBLE]
              This specifies the initial arrow style for polyline/open-
              splines/arcs.  The default is RIGHT.

       Tgif.ShowPageInEPS: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', a showpage PostScript command will be
              generated for an EPS or EPSI file.  The default is true.

       Tgif.MaxNavigateCacheBuffers: NUMBER
              This specifies the number of cache buffers allocated to cache
              remote files (to minimize communication).  NUMBER must be non-
              negative.  The default is 40.

       Tgif.NumberFileInPrintOnePage: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', when PrintOnePage from the Print Menu is
              selected for a stacked multipage drawing (e.g., file.obj),
              file_N with the proper file extension will be generated, where N
              corresponds to the selected page number.  The default is false.

       Tgif.OneMotionTimeout: NUMBER
              When Tgif.OneMotionSelMove is set to true, moving an object is
              considered to be making a selection if the elapse time between
              mouse-down and mouse-up is smaller than the timeout value
              specified by this X default (in milliseconds).  The default is
              200.

       Tgif.MinMoveInterval: NUMBER
              When Tgif.OneMotionSelMove is set to false, moving an object is
              considered to be making a selection if the elapse time between
              mouse-down and mouse-up is smaller than the interval specified
              by this X default (in milliseconds).  The default is 0.

       Tgif.GifToXpm: STRING
              The STRING specifies a command used to convert a GIF file to an
              XPM file.  The STRING must contain a %s substring to be replaced
              by the full path name of the GIF file.  The default is "giftopnm
              %s | ppmtoxpm".

       Tgif.InitExportPixelTrim:
       LEFT_NUMBER,TOP_NUMBER,RIGHT_NUMBER,BOTTOM_NUMBER
              The numbers specify the number of pixels to trim when printing
              or exporting in the XBM, XPM, or GIF format.  The use of these
              values forms an escape mechanism to fix an idiosyncrasy that
              tgif can not figure out exactly how big the whole image is.  The
              default values are all 0's.

       Tgif.QuantizingLevels: NUMBER
              Some image functions such as Sharpen() uses convolution and may
              generate an image that uses more than 256 colors which tgif can
              not handle.  The NUMBER specifies the number of colors to
              quantize down to when such a situation occurs.  The default is
              222.

       Tgif.RotateCursor: [x_cursor,arrow,...]
              This specifies the cursor used in the rotate mode.  Entries in
              <X11/cursorfont.h> (without the XC_ prefix) are valid names of
              the cursor.  The default is crosshair.

       Tgif.ColorLayers: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', each color is considered to be a different
              layer which can be individually turned on and off.  If a color
              layer is turned off, primitive objects in that layer will not be
              visible.  A grouped object only becomes invisible when all its
              constituent objects are invisible.  The default is false.

       Tgif.TiffToXbm: STRING
              The STRING specifies a command used to convert a TIFF file to an
              XBM file.  This command is used when importing an EPSI file
              generated by a Windows application.  The STRING must contain a
              %s substring to be replaced by the full path name of the TIFF
              file.  The default is "tifftopnm %s | pgmtopbm | pbmtoxbm".

       Tgif.DefFixedWidthFont: STRING
              The STRING specifies a font to be used as the default font for
              the Status Window, menus, dialogboxes, etc.  The default is
              "-*-courier-medium-r-normal-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1".

       Tgif.DefFixedWidthRulerFont: STRING
              The STRING specifies a font to be used in the horizontal and
              vertical ruler windows.  The default is "-*-courier-medium-r-
              normal-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1".

       Tgif.MenuFont: STRING
              The STRING specifies a font to be used in menus.  If this X
              default is not specified, the default font is used in menus.

       Tgif.BoldMsgFont: STRING
              The STRING specifies a bold font to be used in buttons and
              dialogboxes.  If this X default is not specified but
              Tgif.MenuFont is specified, this will take on the value of
              Tgif.MenuFont.  If this X default and Tgif.MenuFont are not
              specified, the default font is used in bold messages.

       Tgif.MsgFont: STRING
              The STRING specifies a thin font to be used in the Status Window
              and dialogboxes.  If this X default is not specified, the
              default font is used in messages.

       Tgif.BggenToXpm: STRING
              The STRING specifies a command for generating an X11 pixmap file
              to be executed when RunBggen() is selected from the ImageProc
              Menu.  The STRING must contain two %s substrings.  The first %s
              is to be replaced by a user specified string.  The second %s is
              to be replaced by the geometry of the image.  The default is
              "bggen %s -g %s | ppmquant 64 | ppmtoxpm".  Please note that
              bggen(1) is part of the xv(1) package.

       Tgif.BggenToPpm6: STRING
              The STRING specifies a command for generating a PPM file to be
              executed when RunBggen() is selected from the ImageProc Menu.
              The STRING must contain two %s substrings.  The first %s is to
              be replaced by a user specified string.  The second %s is to be
              replaced by the geometry of the image.  The default is "bggen %s
              -g %s".  Please note that bggen(1) is part of the xv(1) package.

       Tgif.LittleEndianPpm6: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', when reading a PPM (or PGM) file that uses a
              maxval of 65535, little endian format will be assumed (the
              standard for such a format calls for the big endian format).
              The default is false.

       Tgif.DefaultErrorDiffuseLevels: R_NUMBER G_NUMBER B_NUMBER
              The NUMBERs specify the number of bits of red, green, and blue
              to be used when ReduceToDefaultColors() or DefaultErrorDiffuse()
              are selected from the ImageProc Menu.  These values determine a
              set of default colors to be used for color quantization for the
              ReduceToDefaultColors() and DefaultErrorDiffuse() methods.
              R_NUMBER+G_NUMBER+B_NUMBER must be less than or equal to 8, and
              each number must be greater than 0.  The default is 2 2 2.

       Tgif.MaxImportFilters: NUMBER
              This specifies the maximum number of import filters.
              ImportFilter0 through ImportFilterMax, where Max is NUMBER-1, in
              X defaults are queried.  The default is 0.

       Tgif.ImportFilter#: FILTERSTRING
              This specifies an import filter.  FILTERSTRING has 3 parts
              (separated by space characters).  The first part is the name of
              the filter.  It must not contain a space character.  The second
              part contains semicolon-separated file extensions.  The third
              part is the actual filter command for converting the named
              external file type to an X11 pixmap file.  Please see the IMPORT
              RASTER GRAPHICS section for details.

       Tgif.ShowFileNameOnBrowse: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', file names will be shown when
              BrowseXBitmap(), BrowseXPixmap(), or BrowseOther() are selected
              from the File Menu.  The default is true.

       Tgif.HtmlFileExtension: STRING
              The STRING specifies the file extension used when printing in
              the HTML format.  The default is "html".

       Tgif.GenerateHtmlHref: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'' and when printing in the HTML format, the
              value of an href attribute is parsed.  If the value references a
              .obj file, it's changed to have a HTML file extension.  If it is
              set to ``false'', no conversion will be performed.  The default
              is true.

       Tgif.RotationIncrement: NUMBER
              This specifies the initial rotation increment in degrees.  The
              default is 45.

       Tgif.PSA4PaperSize: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'' and A4 size paper is specified, the following
              line is added to a PS/EPS/EPSI file (before "%%EndComments"):

                     %%DocumentPaperSizes: a4

              The default is false.

       Tgif.ShapeShadowSpec: STRING
              The STRING specifies the initial horizontal and vertical offsets
              of a shape shadow.  If both values are zeroes, a shape is
              created without a shadow.  When creating a shape with a shadow,
              background fill pattern (3rd pattern in the first column of the
              Fill Menu) usually gives the best result.  The default is "0,0".

       Tgif.StretchableText: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', stretchable text mode is the initial mode.
              The default is true.

       Tgif.EditTextSize: NUMBER
              This specifies the text size to be used in editing existing text
              objects.  NUMBER should either be 0 or a value between 4 and 34
              (inclusive).  If NUMBER is 0, the actual text size is used in
              editing existing text objects.  The value of the edit text size
              can later be changed by selecting SetEditTextSize() from the
              Properties Menu.  The default is 0.

       Tgif.IconPixmap: (obsolete)
              This X default became obsolete in tgif-4.2 because it clashes
              with the Xtoolket.  It's renamed to Tgif.WMIconPixmap.

       Tgif.WMIconPixmap: STRING
              STRING specifies the path of an XBM or XPM file to be used as
              tgif's desktop icon.  If STRING starts with a / character,
              absolute path is used; otherwise, the actual path of the icon
              file is $TGIFPATH/STRING where TGIFPATH is either defined using
              the X defaults or an environment variable.  This X default is
              only enabled if Tgif.UseWMIcon is set to true.  The default
              value is ``tgificon.xbm'' (which is compiled into tgif).

       Tgif.TmpFileMode: NUMBER (OCTAL)
              This specifies file mode for temporary and exported files.
              NUMBER must be an octal number.  If NUMBER is 0, no attempt is
              made to change the file mode.  If this value is specified (even
              if it's 0), it overrides the PSFILE_MOD compile option.  There
              is no default value.

       Tgif.TitledPinnedMenu: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', pinned menu will have a title bar and left
              button is used for selecting menu items in a pinned menu.  The
              default is true.

       Tgif.ColorFromXPixmap: STRING
              STRING specifies the path of an XPM file to be used to load the
              initial colors.  If this X default is specified, the Tgif.Color#
              X defaults are ignored but Tgif.AdditionalColors X default can
              be used to specify additional colors when tgif starts up.

       Tgif.VectorWarpSoftness: NUMBER
              This specifies the softness value used when VectorWarp() is
              selected from the ImageProc Menu.  VectorWarp() lets the user
              warp pixels in an X11 pixmap object by specifying a vector.  The
              size of the affected area is controlled by this value, which
              must lie between 1.0 and 4.0.  The larger the value, the larger
              the affected area.  The default value is 2.0.

       Tgif.ChangePropertiesOfAttrs: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', changing a property (such as font, font
              size, color, etc.)  of an object will change the property of the
              attributes attached to the object in the same way.  The default
              is false.

       Tgif.ShiftForDiagMouseMove: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', certain mouse movements are restricted to
              multiple of 45 degrees.  The default is true.

       Tgif.UseRecentForDiagMouseMove: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', the object that is used as anchor for
              measuring the moving distance is used as an anchor when objects.
              This only works if Tgif.UseRecentDupDistance and
              Tgif.ShiftForDiagMouseMove are both set to true, The default is
              false.

       Tgif.FlushColormapOnOpen: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', colormap is flushed and the initial tgif
              colors are reloaded when a new file is opened.  The default is
              false.

       Tgif.TransparentPattern: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', fill and pen patterns are transparent
              initially.  The default is false.

       Tgif.DontReencode: STRING
              For fonts that are not iso8859-1 encoded, non-ASCII portion of
              the font (characters with bit 7 on) is by default reencoded as
              if it were iso8859-1 encoded.  If this is not desirable for a
              font, reencoding can be bypassed by including the first part of
              the PostScript font name of the font in STRING.  Fields in
              STRING are colon-separated.  For example, if STRING is
              "Times:Courier:Helvetica", PostScript fonts that begins with
              "Times", "Courier", or "Helvetica" will not be reencoded.
              (Please note that this X default overwrite the fonts specified
              by -D_DONT_REENCODE at compile time.)  Please also see the
              POSTSCRIPT CHARACTER ENCODING FOR INTERNATINOAL CHARACTERS
              section for an example.

       Tgif.AdditionalDontReencode: STRING
              Use this X default to augment Tgif.DontReencode (or the fonts
              specified by -D_DONT_REENCODE at compile time).  STRING here is
              basically concatenated to the STRING specified by
              Tgif.DontReencode (or the fonts specified by -D_DONT_REENCODE at
              compile time).

       Tgif.UnsignedInXBmExport: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', unsigned char will be used instead of char
              in exported XBM files.  The default is false.

       Tgif.CommentInBitmapExport: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', a blank RCS Header comment will be prepended
              to exported XBM and XPM files.  The default is false.

       Tgif.ShowFontSizeInPoints: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', font sizes are displayed in the unit of
              point sizes.  The default is false.

       Tgif.DontCondensePSFile: [true,false]
              By default, PS/EPS files generated by tgif are not condensed.
              If this X default is set to ``false'', tgif will generate
              condensed PS/EPS files.  The default is true.

       Tgif.StripCondensedPSComments: (obsolete)
              This X default became obsolete in tgif-4.0.11 because it turns
              out that it's not always okay to strip PS comments (it should
              always be set to false).

       Tgif.PdfFileExtension: STRING
              The STRING specifies the file extension used when printing in
              the PDF format.  The default is "pdf".

              name of the PDF file.  The default is:

                     ps2pdf "%s" "%s"

              (If you like to use "epstopdf", you can try setting this to
              "epstopdf %s --outfile=%s".)

       Tgif.EpsToTmpSvg: STRING
              Converting an EPS file to an SVG file is done in two steps.
              First the EPS file is converted to a temporary file and then the
              temporary file is converted to an SVG file.  By default, the
              uniconvertor(1) format is used for the temporary file.  The
              STRING here specifies a command for the first part and it must
              contain 2 %s substrings to be replaced by the full path name of
              the EPS file and the full path name of the temporary file.  The
              default is:

              substring to be replaced by the full path name of the PPM file.
              The default is "pnmquant -fs %d %s".

       Tgif.JpegFileExtension: STRING
              The STRING specifies the file extension for a JPEG file.  The
              default is "jpg" (lower case).

       Tgif.ProducedBy: STRING
              When printing/exporting PS/EPS files, STRING will appear in a
              %%ProducedBy line in a exported PS/EPS file.  Please include
              your name and e-mail address in STRING.  The default is
              "(unknown)".

              example, you can use "xemacs -title '%s' '%s'".  The default is
              "xterm -title '%s' -e vi '%s'".

       Tgif.GoHyperSpaceInSlideShow: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', hyperspace mode will be entered when tgif
              enters the slideshow mode.  The default is false.

       Tgif.LineWidthIndexInSlideShow: NUMBER
              This specifies the line width index to use when tgif is in the
              slideshow mode.  The default value is 4.

       Tgif.MaxRecentFiles: NUMBER
              This specifies the maximum number of files to remember in the
              recently used file list.  The default value is 10.

       Tgif.ResetOriginOnAdvancePage: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', tgif will scroll to the left-top corner of
              the page when pages are advanced.  The default is false.

       Tgif.UseMeasureTooltip: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', the location of the cursor and the width and
              height of the object being drawn/dragged/stretched will be shown
              in a tooltip window.  This X default only takes effect if
              Tgif.ShowMeasurement is true.  The default is false.

       Tgif.MeasureTooltipXFollowMouse: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', the X position of the measurement tooptip
              will follow the mouse.  The default is false.

       Tgif.MeasureTooltipYFollowMouse: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', the Y position of the measurement tooptip
              will follow the mouse.  The default is false.

       Tgif.MeasureTooltipHorizontalPosition: [left,center,right]
              Fix the X position of the measurement tooltip to the left,
              center, or right.  This X default only takes effect if
              Tgif.MeasureTooltipXFollowMouse is false.  The default is left.

       Tgif.MeasureTooltipVerticalPosition: [top,middle,bottom]
              Fix the Y position of the measurement tooltip to the top,
              middle, or bottom.  This X default only takes effect if
              Tgif.MeasureTooltipYFollowMouse is false.  The default is top.

       Tgif.MeasureTooltipVerbose: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', additional information about the positions
              and sizes of objects will be displayed in the tooltip window.
              The default is false.

       Tgif.NoMinWinSize: [true,false]
              If set to ``false'', tgif will have a minimum window size so
              that the whole panel window is always visible.  The problem with
              this setting is that some window manager will show the wrong
              window size when you resize the window.  This setting is left
              for compatibility reasons.  If set to ``true'', a side effect is
              that the menubar will no longer automatically wraps around when
              Tgif.MinimalMenubar is set to true.  The default is true.

       Tgif.AutoWrapMenubar: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', the menubar will automatically wrap around.
              If Tgif.MinimalMenubar is set to false, menubar will always wrap
              around automatically.  The default is false.

       Tgif.AutoEPSPreviewBitmap: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', when importing a PS/EPS file, tgif will
              automatically generate a preview bitmap if the file does not
              already contain one.  The default is false.

       Tgif.PsToXbm: STRING
              STRING specifies a command used to convert a PS file to a XBM
              file.  The STRING must contain a single %s substrings to be
              replaced by the full path name of the PS file.  Please note that
              the above command usually generates a bitmap that's much larger
              than image in the file.  Tgif automatically trims out the blank
              space similar to the way pbmtoepsi works.  The default is "gs -q
              -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=pbm -sOutputFile=- -- "%s" | pbmtoxbm".

       Tgif.TmpDirInHomeDir: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', tgif will use the $HOME/.Tgif directory as
              the temporary directory (unless the Tgif.TmpDir X default below
              is used) and the compiler option -DTMP_DIR is ignored.  The
              default is false if the -D_TMP_DIR_IN_HOME_DIR compiler option
              is used.  The default is true if the -D_TMP_DIR_IN_HOME_DIR
              compiler option is not used.

       Tgif.TmpDir: STRING
              STRING specifies a directory to be used as the temporary
              directory.  The use of this X default is discouraged, especially
              if tgif is compiled with -DUSE_XT_INITIALIZE and a X resource
              file found in the directory search path specified by the
              environment variable $XAPPLRESDIR is used.  By default, tgif
              uses /tmp as the temporary directory.

       Tgif.ThumbnailGeometry: WIDTHxHEIGHT
              This X default specifies the geometry of thumbnails.  The
              default is 160x120.

       Tgif.ThumbnailPadding: NUMBER
              This specifies the padding (in pixels) for thumbnail images.
              The default value is 8.

       Tgif.ThumbnailXGap: NUMBER
              This specifies the horizontal gap (in pixels) for thumbnail
              images.  The default value is 16.

       Tgif.ThumbnailYGap: NUMBER
              This specifies the vertical gap (in pixels) for thumbnail
              images.  The default value is 0.

       Tgif.ThumbnailX: NUMBER
              This specifies the starting x location (in pixels) for thumbnail
              images.  The default value is 32.

       Tgif.ThumbnailY: NUMBER
              This specifies the starting y location (in pixels) for thumbnail
              images.  The default value is 32.

       Tgif.ShowWireSignalName: [true,false]
              If set to ``false'', when connecting ports, tgif will
              automatically place the signal name and hide it.  Otherwise, the
              user will be prompted to place the signal name and it will be
              visible.  The default is true.

       Tgif.LandscapePdfSetPageDevice: (obsolete)
              This X default became obsolete in tgif-4.1.42 because the name
              is misleading.  Please see Tgif.PdfSetPageDevice below.

       Tgif.PdfSetPageDevice: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', when exporting PDF (or PS) files, tgif will
              use PostScript "setpagedevice" command to specify the paper size
              in the generated PostScript file before calling ps2pdf(1) (if
              exporting in PDF format).  This should not be necessary (and is
              considered a bug in ps2pdf).  In the future, this X default can
              be used to turn off the generation of the "setpagedevice"
              command when ps2pdf can handle landscape PostScript files
              correctly.

       Tgif.DeleteCmdAsCut: (obsolete)
              This X default became obsolete in tgif-4.2.3.  Now <Cntrl>x
              binds to the Cut command.  Tgif.EnableMouseWheel: [true,false]
              If set to ``false'', Button4 and Button5 mouse wheel scrolling
              events will be ignored.  The default is true.
              Tgif.Btn2PopupMainMenu: [true,false] If set to ``false'',
              Button2 events will not bring up the Main Menu in the canvas
              window.  The default is true.

       Tgif.NoChoiceWindow: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', no Choice and Message Windows will be shown
              initially.  The default is false.

       Tgif.UseXPmVersion1ForXPmDeck: [true,false]
              The setting of this X default should depend on the setting of
              the Tgif.XpmDeckToGifAnim X default above.  If set to ``true'',
              XPM1 file is generated when a deck of X11 pixmap objects is
              being converted to a GIF animation file regardless of the
              setting of the Tgif.XPmOutputVersion X default.  The default is
              true.

       Tgif.SlideShowWindowOffsets: X_OFFSET,Y_OFFSET
              The numbers specify the number of pixels to adjust for the
              slideshow mode.  If only one value is given, both X and Y
              offsets are set to the same value.  The default values are all
              0's.

       Tgif.SlideShowBorderColor: COLORSTRING
              This specifies the color to be used for the area outside of the
              paper boundary in slideshow mode.  By default, the color of the
              border is the same as the background color.

       Tgif.ConvertToBezierSegments: NUMBER
              This specifies the number of segments used in converting a
              polyline/spline object to a Bezier curve.  The default value is
              50.

       Tgif.TickMarkSize: NUMBER
              This specifies the size of a tick mark to be used when tick
              marks are added at a vertex of a polyline/polygon/spline.  The
              default value is 8.

       Tgif.NoModeWindow: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', no Mode Window will be shown initially.  The
              default is false.

       Tgif.MakeUnsavableInSlideShow: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', the current file will be made unsavable when
              slideshow mode is entered.  (If the current file contains auto
              page numbering objects, the file will be made unsavable
              regardless of the setting of this X default.)  The default is
              false.

       Tgif.SingleByteInputMethod: STRING
              This specifies the input method for single-byte fonts.
              Currently, only "xim" is supported.

       Tgif.IgnoreSlideShowOffsetsInFile: [true,false]
              If set to ``false'', the slideshow offsets stored in a file will
              override the Tgif.SlideShowWindowOffsets setting.  The default
              is true.

       Tgif.ItalicMsgFont: STRING
              The STRING specifies a italic font to be used in some buttons.
              If this X default is not specified but Tgif.MenuFont is
              specified, this will take on the value of Tgif.MenuFont.  If
              this X default and Tgif.MenuFont are not specified, the default
              font is used in italic messages.

       Tgif.ItalicMsgFontSet: STRING
              This X default is only used if tgif is compiled with the
              ENABLE_NLS compiler option.  The STRING specifies a list of
              fonts to be used in messageboxes.  STRING can be ``none'' to
              indicate not to use italic message font set.  The default is
              "-*-helvetica-medium-o-normal--12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*,-*-*-medium-
              r-*--12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*".

       Tgif.BoldItalicMsgFont: STRING
              The STRING specifies a bold italic font to be used in some text.
              If this X default is not specified but Tgif.MenuFont is
              specified, this will take on the value of Tgif.MenuFont.  If
              this X default and Tgif.MenuFont are not specified, the default
              font is used in bold italic messages.

       Tgif.BoldItalicMsgFontSet: STRING
              This X default is only used if tgif is compiled with the
              ENABLE_NLS compiler option.  The STRING specifies a list of
              fonts to be used in some text.  STRING can be ``none'' to
              indicate not to use bold italic message font set.  The default
              is "-*-helvetica-bold-o-normal--12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*,-*-*-medium-
              r-*--12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*".

       Tgif.ExternalPsToEpsi: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', the execution of the pstoepsi() internal
              command will simply invoke pstoepsi externally.  The default is
              false.

       Tgif.GsPath: STRING
              The STRING specifies a full path name of the gs (ghostscript)
              program.  The default is "gs" (which implies that the "gs"
              excutable is in your PATH).

       Tgif.CompoundObjWithTextStretchableForPSE: [true,false]
              If set to ``false'', when executing the Precise Scale Everything
              command, a compound object will not be stretched if it contains
              a text subobject.  This X default only has effect if tgif is in
              the non-stretchable text mode.  (If tgif is in the stretchable
              text mode, this X default is ignored.)  The default is false.

       Tgif.HideWindowsInSlideShow: [true,false]
              If set to ``false'', tgif will keep all windows visible in
              slideshow mode.  Otherwise, only the canvas window will be
              visible in slideshow mode.  The default is true.

       Tgif.PSDistillerNoImageCompress: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', tgif will generate PostScript code so that
              images in a generated PostScript file will not be compressed by
              a distiller program such as ps2pdf.  The default is false.

       Tgif.AdditionalPSSetup: STRING
              If specified, the PostScript line specified by STRING is
              inserted at the end of PostScript file setup (right before
              %%EndSetup).  This option should only be used if one is very
              familiar with PostScript.  Here is an example to ask distiller
              programs not to compress bitmap images:

                     Tgif.AdditionalPSSetup: \n\
                         systemdict /setdistillerparams known \n\
                         { << /AutoFilterGrayImages false \n\
                         /AutoFilterColorImages false \n\
                         /ColorImageFilter /FlateEncode \n\
                         /GrayImageFilter /FlateEncode \n\
                         >> setdistillerparams } if

       Tgif.PSFontNeedCharSubs: FONTSUB_SPEC1 FONTSUB_SPEC2 ...
              The format of FONTSUB_SPEC is FONTNAME=TOKENNAME where FONTNAME
              is the name of a PostScript font and TOKENNAME is the name of
              the extension for the Tgif.PSCharSubs_TOKENNAME X default.  For
              PostScript font names that begins with a string that matches a
              FONTNAME part of a FONTSUB_SPEC, tgif will read the
              Tgif.PSCharSubs_TOKENNAME X default to determine which
              characters will be substituted.

              For fonts that are not iso8859-1 encoded, non-ASCII portion of
              the font (characters with bit 7 on) is by default reencoded as
              if it were iso8859-1 encoded when PS output is generated.  If
              this is not desired, different named PS characters can be
              substituted for characters with bit 7 on.  Please also see the
              POSTSCRIPT CHARACTER ENCODING FOR INTERNATINOAL CHARACTERS
              section for an example.

       Tgif.PSCharSubs_TOKENNAME: PSCHARSUBS_SPEC1 PSCHARSUBS_SPEC2 ...
              TOKENNAME must match a FONTSUB_SPEC in the
              Tgif.PSFontNeedCharSubs X default.  The format for
              PSCHARSUBS_SPEC is OLDCHARCODE/NEWCHARNAME where OLDCHARCODE is
              a character code in octal format and NEWCHARNAME is a PostScript
              character name to use.  For more information, please see the
              POSTSCRIPT CHARACTER ENCODING FOR INTERNATINOAL CHARACTERS
              section.

       Tgif.DrawTextFuncKey_F#: INTERNAL COMMAND LIST
              This specifies the correspondence between a function key and a
              list of internal commands.  When function key F# is pressed when
              tgif is in the text drawing mode, the corresponding list of
              internal commands is executed.  Tgif only recognizes function
              keys F1 through F12.

       Tgif.PasteFromXSelectionOnly: [true,false]
              If set to ``false'', if tgif has failed to perform a paste via
              the X Selections mechanism, it will attempt the old style paste
              (directly fetch bytes from the X server).  This is mainly used
              with an older X servers.  The default is true.

       Tgif.PasteFromSelectionTimeout: NUMBER
              This specifies the number of seconds for a paste operation to
              timeout.  The default value is 10.

       Tgif.LengthLimit256InInsertChar: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', the maximum number of characters per line of
              text is set at 256.  Additional characters are ignored.  The
              default is false.

       Tgif.JpegToPpm6: STRING
              The STRING specifies a command used to convert a JPEG file to a
              PPM file in the P6 format.  The STRING must contain a %s
              substring to be replaced by the full path name of the JPEG file.
              The default is:

                     djpeg -ppm "%s"

       Tgif.PngToPpm6: STRING
              The STRING specifies a command used to convert a PNG file to a
              PPM file in the P6 format.  The STRING must contain a %s
              substring to be replaced by the full path name of the PNG file.
              The default is:

                     pngtopnm "%s"

       Tgif.ObjectShadowOffsets: X_OFFSET,Y_OFFSET
              The numbers specify the number of pixels to be offseted when
              creating a generic object shadow.  If only one value is given,
              both X and Y offsets are set to the same value.  The default
              values are all 2's.

       Tgif.ObjectShadowColor: COLORSTRING
              This specifies the color to be used for generic object shadow.
              The default value is "#c0c0c0".

       Tgif.IgnoreObjectShadowInfoInFile: [true,false]
              If set to ``false'', the generic object shadow information
              stored in a file will override the Tgif.ObjectShadowOffsets and
              Tgif.ObjectShadowColor settings.  The default is true.

       Tgif.ReportMissingFonts: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', when tgif starts, missing X fonts will be
              printed to the terminal.  The default is false.

       Tgif.CustomPatternDir: STRING
              STRING specifies a directory that contains custom fill and pen
              patterns.  Any valid XBM file, encoding a bitmap of arbitrary
              dimensions, name pat#.xbm (for 3<=<=31) in this directory will
              replace the corresponding default pattern .

       Tgif.EnableTrueColorImages: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', on a TrueColor display, PPM and JPEG objects
              will use 24-bit color.  Tgif must be compiled with zlib support
              to enable this.  The default is true.

       Tgif.AutoRotatePivot: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', user-specified rotation pivot will be
              disabled.  The default is false.

       Tgif.RightMargin: STRING
              The STRING specifies the right margin.  The right margin must be
              specified with a unit (the choices are "pixel", "in", or "cm").
              The default is "1 in" if Tgif.GridSystem is "English" and "2.5
              cm" if Tgif.GridSystem is "Metric".

       Tgif.EnableRightMargin: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', a simple right-margin will be used when
              entering text.  This is not a full-featured right-margin.  It is
              only activated under the following conditions: text object is
              not transformed, text is left-justified, text cursor is not
              inside a superscript or a subscript, no zoome, and
              Tgif.EditTextSize is not used.  The default is false.

       Tgif.NoOrientationIfPdfSetPageDevice: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', the "%%Orientation:" line is not generated
              in the PostScript file if "setpagedevice" is active when
              exporting a PS/EPS/PDF file.  Please see Tgif.PdfSetPageDevice
              above.  The default is false.

       Tgif.PNGExportHasTransparentColor: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', the color specified by the
              Tgif.PNGExportTransparentColor X default will be made
              transparent when printing in the PNG format.  The default is
              false.

       Tgif.PNGExportTransparentColor: COLORSTRING
              This specifies the color to be made transparent when printing in
              the PNG format.  By default, the default background color is
              used.

       Tgif.PpmToPngWithTransparentColor: STRING
              The STRING specifies a command used to convert a PPM file to a
              PNG file with a transparent color.  The STRING must contain
              exactly two %s substring to be replaced by the transparent color
              and full path name of a PPM file.  The default is "pnmtopng
              -transparent '%s' '%s'".

       Tgif.EnableThresholdFloodReplaceColor: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', threshold-based Flood Fill and Replace Color
              will be used.  The default is false.

       Tgif.FloodReplaceColorThreshold: RED_THRESH,GREEN_THRESH,BLUE_THRESH
              In threshold-based Flood Fill and Replace Color, after a pixel
              is selected, pixels that have colors similar to the selected
              pixel will also change color.  The similarity is defined by
              these 3 threshold values.  Each value must be between 0 and 255,
              inclusive.  The default values are all 15's.

       Tgif.UseStdPalette8: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', a standard 8 palette will be used as the
              startup colors.  These colors correspond to all 8 combination of
              0x00 and 0xff in red, green, and blue color components.  If this
              X default is used, the Tgif.AdditionalColors X default can be
              used to specify additional colors when tgif starts up.  The
              default is false.

       Tgif.UseStdPalette27: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', a standard 27-color palette will be used as
              the startup colors.  These colors correspond to all 27
              combination of 0x00, 0x80, and 0xff in red, green, and blue
              color components.  If this X default is used, the
              Tgif.AdditionalColors X default can be used to specify
              additional colors when tgif starts up.  The default is false.

       Tgif.UseStdPalette64: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', a standard 64-color palette will be used as
              the startup colors.  These colors correspond to all 64
              combination of 0x00, 0x55, 0xaa, and 0xff in red, green, and
              blue color components.  If this X default is used, the
              Tgif.AdditionalColors X default can be used to specify
              additional colors when tgif starts up.  The default is false.

       Tgif.UseStdPalette216: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', a standard 216 palette will be used as the
              startup colors.  These colors are known as Mobile Web-safe
              colors and they correspond to all 216 combination of 0x00, 0x33,
              0x66, 0x99, 0xcc, and 0xff in red, green, and blue color
              components.  If this X default is used, the
              Tgif.AdditionalColors X default can be used to specify
              additional colors when tgif starts up.  The default is false.

       Tgif.UseMobileWebSafePalette: [true,false]
              This is identical to Tgif.UseStdPalette216.

       Tgif.UseOpenOfficeGalaxyPalette: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', the OpenOffice Galaxy (53-color) palette
              will be used as the startup colors.  If this X default is used,
              the Tgif.AdditionalColors X default can be used to specify
              additional colors when tgif starts up.  The default is false.

       Tgif.UseOpenOfficeGooglePalette: [true,false]
              If set to ``true'', the OpenOffice Google (80-color) palette
              will be used as the startup colors.  If this X default is used,
              the Tgif.AdditionalColors X default can be used to specify
              additional colors when tgif starts up.  The default is false.

       Tgif.AdditionalColors: COLOR1, COLOR2 ...
              If any of the Tgif.ColorFromXPixmap, Tgif.UseStdPalette8,
              Tgif.UseStdPalette27, Tgif.UseStdPalette64,
              Tgif.UseStdPalette216, Tgif.UseMobileWebSafePalette,
              Tgif.UseOpenOfficeGalaxyPalette, or
              Tgif.UseOpenOfficeGooglePalette X defaults is used, additional
              startup colors can be specified using this X default.  Since
              color names can contain space characters, the colors must be
              separated by commas.

       Tgif.DefaultColor: COLORSTRING
              This specifies the default color if a certain color can not be
              found.  It has precedence over the Tgif.DefaultColorIndex X
              default.  If this X default is not specified,
              Tgif.DefaultColorIndex will determine the default color.
              Tgif.GifToPpm6: STRING The STRING specifies a command used to
              convert a GIF file to a PPM file in the P6 format.  The STRING
              must contain a %s substring to be replaced by the full path name
              of the GIF file.  The default is:

                     giftopnm "%s"

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE
       TGIFPATH
              This environment variable should be set such that the files,
              mentioned in the FILES section below, can be found.

       TGIFICON
              This environment variable should be set to the name of the
              object file to be displayed when tgif is iconified.  By default,
              it is set to ``tgificon''.  If it starts with a / character,
              absolute path is used; otherwise, the icon file is assumed to be
              $TGIFPATH/$TGIFICON.

       TGIF_[Domain]
              Obsoleted.

FILES
       $TGIFPATH/tgificon.obj contains the default tgif icon.

       $TGIFPATH/keys.obj contains a summary of the non-alphanumeric key
       bindings.

PROLOG/C TESTDRIVE
       In the tgif distribution, there are three Prolog files which illustrate
       a simple Prolog driver.  tgif.pl contains predicates for parsing tgif
       files (both .obj and .sym).  frontend.pl contains predicates for
       talking to Prolog engines, such as that of Quintus and SISCtus, through
       the foreign function interface.  To use frontend.pl, frontend11.o needs
       to be built (which requires the frontend11.o entry to be uncommented
       from the makefiles).  Finally, testdrive.pl contains a program which
       will print out the ID files of all objects in the current drawing, if
       tgif is escaped with the Solve() (or #s) command.  This is also a good
       way of finding out the structure of a tgif file (especially because the
       structure is not documented due to the complexity introduced to keep
       tgif compatible with files created by older versions).

       A very simple C driver, testdrive.c, is also provided with the tgif
       distribution which perform the same function as the Prolog driver.  The
       extra code present in this file (and not present in tgif.c) is used to
       illustrate how the in-memory objects and attributes can be traversed
       and how new objects can be created and manipulated.

IDIOSYNCRASIES
       When any of the ``escape to driver'' commands are (accidentally)
       executed, the current content of the drawing is saved into
       ``tmpmodel.obj'' if the drawing indicates that it is a .obj file; then
       tgif escapes to the driver and returns right away.  If the drawing
       indicates that it is a .sym file, then the content is saved into
       ``tmpmodel.sym'', but tgif does not return to the driver.

       The paste operation works on a cut buffer generated by tgif or by non-
       tgif tools (such as xterm).  If the cut buffer is not generated by
       tgif, its content is treated as a collection of ASCII character
       strings, which is inserted into the current drawing as a text object
       (current settings for text objects are used to create the text object).
       If the cut buffer is generated by tgif, then all the current settings
       are ignored.

       The font sizes are the screen font sizes (which correspond to the X
       fonts that are used to draw the text on the screen).  They appear
       smaller on the printout.  When a 24 point text is printed, it would
       correspond to about a 13.5 point PostScript text.  This is because tgif
       treats 128 pixels as an inch, and PostScript treats 72 points as an
       inch.

       Because characters supported by X11 and PostScript are different, not
       all the characters, especially in the range 128 to 255 (or \200 to
       \377), which are supported by X11, but are not accepted by tgif.
       Furthermore, in order to print the supported subset of these
       characters, character codes must be re-encoded.  Therefore, if one
       would like to hack tgif to support other personalized fonts, one should
       be careful about the re-encoding mechanism.

       The grids are not absolute; they are specified as screen pixels, and
       they scale with the current zoom.  For example, if the grid is set at
       16 pixels at maximum zoom, and if the user zooms out once, objects can
       be drawn, moved, or stretched at 16 screen pixel increments, but this
       corresponds to 32 pixels in the real coordinate system.

       If the vertical text spacing is set to negative values, highlighted
       text will look a little strange due to XOR operations.  If the vertical
       text spacing is set to be greater than 100 or less than -100, the panel
       window will not be cleared properly; to clear the panel window, the
       user may have to close the tgif window and then open it again.

       As described in the TGIF SUBWINDOWS section, in constrained move mode,
       if both endpoints of a not-selected polyline lie inside the object
       being moved, then the whole polyline is moved.  This may look strange
       sometimes because, for example, if one starts with a line segment
       pointing to an object, just moving the object will cause the line
       segment to be ``stretched''; however, if one eventually moves the
       object so that the other endpoint is also inside the object, any future
       movement of the object will cause the whole line segment to move
       (instead of just moving the original endpoint).  The moving of the
       vertex which is the neighbor of a moved endpoint may also look strange
       at times.  At this point, one should switch to the unconstrained move
       mode.

       Another idiosyncrasy with respect to the constrained move is that right
       after duplicating an object, the constrained move is disabled
       temporarily because it is assumed that at this point the user would
       want to move the new object to a desirable position, and only after
       this new object is ``settled down'', the constrained move will be re-
       enabled.  Settling down is signified by doing something other than
       moving the new object.

       Locked objects can be deleted.

       Under the Edit Menu, PasteFromFile() reads a file into the drawing.
       Pasting from a file is different from the normal pasting operation
       where copying is performed in something like xterm because tabs are
       automatically converted to spaces.  Tabs are ignored when pasting from
       a file.

       When printing a multipage drawing, all pages (even the ones that
       contains no objects) will be printed.  Using the PrintOnePage() command
       under the Page Menu one can print the selected page (in stacked page
       layout mode, this is the current page; in tiled page layout mode, the
       user is prompted to select a visible page).

       Tgif can be setup to use its own icon window (the Tgif.NoTgifIcon and
       the Tgif.UseWMIconPixmap X defaults must both be set to false).
       However, it may confuse certain window managers.  So, if the effect is
       undesirable, one can set the Tgif.UseWMIconPixmap X defaults to true.

BUGS
       There seems to be a problem with printing Courier fonts with a non-
       solid pen on the Apple LaserWriter.  (Printing single character does
       seem to work fine.)  As pointed out by the PostScript reference manual,
       Courier is a ``stroked font'', and it is usually ``difficult'' to
       construct character paths for such types of fonts.  However, Courier
       fonts work fine with ghostscript(1) and dxpsview.  It's not clear how
       this problem can be fixed.  The author recommends avoiding Courier
       fonts when printing in color if a non-solid pen is desired.

       Arcs with arrow tips don't look very sharp (the tip is not pointed as
       in open-splines with arrow tips).

       At high magnifications, stretching arcs may cause anomalous behavior
       due to round off errors.

       When page reduction/magnification is not set at 100%, the markings in
       the Ruler Windows do not correspond to real measurements.

       Copying/pasting large objects might not work because tgif does not use
       the ``selection'' mechanism (yet).

       If and when tgif crashes, it will try to save the current content of
       the drawing in a file called ``EmergencySave.obj'' (or
       ``EmergencySave.sym'' if the current drawing specifies a symbol
       object).  Often, the drawing can be restored by loading the
       ``EmergencySave.obj'' file.  Nevertheless, if the cause of the crash is
       that some objects are corrupted (due to programming bugs), then the
       ``EmergencySave.obj'' file may also be corrupted.

       When launching an application, if the command does not end with the '&'
       character and the command does not terminate, tgif also hangs.  In this
       case, kill(1) should be used to send HUP signal to the tgif process if
       one wants to save the content of tgif in ``EmergencySave.obj''.

       The file exec.c may not compile properly on AIX machines.  One might
       have to add -D_BSD to the DEFINES in either the Imakefile or
       Makefile.noimake.
