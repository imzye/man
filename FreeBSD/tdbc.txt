ARGUMENTS
       Tcl_Interp *interp (in/out)        Pointer to a Tcl interpreter.

       const char *state (in)             Pointer to a character string
                                          containing a 'SQL state' from a
                                          database error.

       const char *sqlcode (in)           Pointer to a character string

DESCRIPTION
       The TDBC library provides several C procedures that simplify writing a
       TDBC driver. They include a procedure that tokenizes a SQL statement,
       locating variables to be substituted, and a procedure that accepts a
       SQL state and returns an error class for the interpreter error
       information.

       Tdbc_Init must be invoked prior to any other TDBC call.  It accepts a
       pointer to a Tcl interpreter, and arranges to load the TDBC library. It
       returns TCL_OK if the Tcl library was loaded successfully, and
       TCL_ERROR otherwise. If TCL_ERROR is returned, the interpreter's result
       contains the error message.

       Tdbc_TokenizeSql accepts a pointer to a Tcl interpreter, and a pointer
       to a character string containing one or more SQL statements. It
       tokenizes the SQL statements, and returns a pointer to a Tcl_Obj that
       contains a list of the tokens that make up the statement. Concatenating
       the tokens together will yield the original SQL code. The returned
       Tcl_Obj has a reference count of zero. The caller is responsible for
       managing the reference count as needed.  See TOKENS below for a
       description of what may be in the returned list of tokens.

       Tdbc_MapSqlState accepts a pointer to a string, usually five characters
       long, that is the 'SQL state' that resulted from a database error. It
       returns a character string that is suitable for inclusion as the error
       class when constructing the error code for an error in a TDBC driver.
       (By convention, the error code is a list having at least four elements:
       "TDBC errorClass sqlstate driverName details...".)

TOKENS
       Each token returned from Tdbc_TokenizeSql may be one of the following:

       [1]    A bound variable, which begins with one of the characters ':',
              '@', or '$'. The remainder of the string is the variable name
              and will consist of alphanumeric characters and underscores.
              (The leading character will be be non-numeric.)

       [2]    A semicolon that separates two SQL statements.

       [3]    Something else in a SQL statement. The tokenizer does not
              attempt to parse SQL; it merely identifies bound variables
              (distinguishing them from similar strings appearing inside
              quotes or comments) and statement delimiters.
