SND_CSA(4)             FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual             SND_CSA(4)

NAME
     snd_csa – Crystal Semiconductor CS461x/462x/4280 PCI bridge device driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device sound
           device snd_csa

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           snd_csa_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The snd_csa bridge driver allows the generic audio driver sound(4) to
     attach to Crystal Semiconductor CS461x/462x/4280 based sound cards.

HARDWARE
     The snd_csa driver supports the following sound cards:

     •   Crystal Semiconductor CS4280
     •   Crystal Semiconductor CS4610
     •   Crystal Semiconductor CS4611
     •   Crystal Semiconductor CS4614
     •   Crystal Semiconductor CS4615
     •   Crystal Semiconductor CS4622
     •   Crystal Semiconductor CS4624
     •   Crystal Semiconductor CS4630
     •   Genius Soundmaker 128 Value
     •   Hercules Game Theatre XP
     •   Turtle Beach Santa Cruz

     Some onboard CS4610 chips are accompanied by the CS423x ISA codec instead
     of the CS4297 AC97 codec.  Such configurations are not supported by the
     snd_csa driver yet.

HISTORY
     The snd_csa device driver first appeared in FreeBSD 4.0.
