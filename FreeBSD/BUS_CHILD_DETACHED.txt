BUS_CHILD_DETACHED(9)  FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual BUS_CHILD_DETACHED(9)

NAME
     BUS_CHILD_DETACHED – notify a bus device that a child was detached

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <sys/bus.h>

     void
     BUS_CHILD_DETACHED(device_t dev, device_t child);

DESCRIPTION
     The BUS_CHILD_DETACHED() method is invoked by the new-bus framework after
     a device is detached.  A bus driver can provide an implementation of this
     method to reclaim any resources allocated on behalf of the child or to
     cleanup state not properly released by a DEVICE_DETACH(9) method.
