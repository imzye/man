NSS_MDNS.CONF(5)          FreeBSD File Formats Manual         NSS_MDNS.CONF(5)

NAME
     nss_mdns.conf – configuration file for libnss_mdns(8).

DESCRIPTION
     This file describes the domains that libnss_mdns(8) is to support.  If a
     lookup domain is not in this list, then NSS_STATUS_NOTFOUND will be
     returned to libc and processing will continue according to
     nsswitch.conf(5).

   Configuration file format
     Lines containing only whitespace or lines whose first non-whitespace
     character is ‘#’ are ignored.  No single line may be greater than 1023
     characters plus end-of-line.

           domain x.y.z

     Enable use of libnss_mdns(8) to lookup DNS entries in the ‘x.y.z’ domain.
     Leading and trailing dots are dropped.

     Reverse (PTR) lookups are enabled using their DNS names.  IPv6 names use
     "nibble format".

           domain 254.169.in-addr.arpa
           domain 0.8.e.f.ip6.arpa

   Default configuration
     If the configuration file cannot be found then the following is assumed.

           domain local
           domain 0.8.e.f.ip6.int
           domain 0.8.e.f.ip6.arpa
