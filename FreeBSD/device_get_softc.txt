DEVICE_GET_SOFTC(9)    FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual   DEVICE_GET_SOFTC(9)

NAME
     device_get_softc – access driver private instance variables

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <sys/bus.h>

     void *
     device_get_softc(device_t dev);

DESCRIPTION
     Return the driver-specific software context of dev.  The softc is
     automatically allocated and zeroed when the device is attached.  The
     softc is also initialized and present when a device is probed, but is
     subject to caveats as described in DEVICE_PROBE(9).  The size of the
     allocation is determined by the device's driver_t information used to
     define the driver.  The softc typically encapsulates the state of this
     instance of the device.

     Driver writers are discouraged from using their own softc management
     mechanisms.  Driver writers should not copy such mechanisms found in
     drivers in the tree that predate this function.

RETURN VALUES
     The pointer to the driver-specific instance variable is returned.
