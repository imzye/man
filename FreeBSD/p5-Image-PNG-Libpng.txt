NAME
       pnginspect - print contents of PNG files

SYNOPSIS
           pnginspect a.png b.png c.png

DESCRIPTION
       Print a text representation of the data within a PNG image file to
       standard output. It reads the PNG file, prints out its header
       information and its valid chunks, and then attempts to read all the
       chunks. Most of the chunks are printed using Data::Dumper. Modification
       time and text segments are printed specially.

       The image data is not currently printed out.

       If you have Data::Validate::URI and LWP::Simple installed, you can also
       use it to examine PNG files on the web, like this:

           pnginspect http://libpng.org/pub/png/img_png/libpng-88x31.png

       These modules are not installed automatically by Image::PNG::Libpng, so
       please install them yourself if you would like to use this facility.

OPTIONS
       --verbose
           Print verbose information for debugging.
