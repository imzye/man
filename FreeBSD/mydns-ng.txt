NAME
       mydns.conf - mydns(8) configuration file.


DESCRIPTION
       mydns.conf is read by mydns(8) on startup.  The default location of
       this file is /usr/local/etc/mydns.conf.

       A mydns.conf might look something like this:

              # /usr/local/etc/mydns.conf
              # Configuration file for the MyDNS name daemon

              db-host = dbserver.example.com
              db-user = mydnsuser
              db-password = Gr8DNS!

       Each line in the file may contain only one configuration variable.  All
       allowable configuration variables are described in this man page.  The
       syntax for a configuration line is `option [= value]'.  All
       configuration variables have default values, which are used if the
       variable is omitted from the mydns.conf.  These defaults are listed in
       parentheses after the variable syntax.

       All text following a hash mark (`#') and empty lines are ignored.  If
       you need to specify an actual hash mark in a option value, escape it by
       prefixing it with a backslash (`\') character.

       The mydns(8) program has a convenient command-line option that will
       output all current configuration variables in mydns.conf format.  If
       you are creating a mydns.conf file for the first time, this is a great
       way to create a template that you can customize.  See mydns(8) for
       details.





DATABASE INFORMATION
       The following configuration variables tell MyDNS about your database
       server.


       db-host = hostname (`localhost')
              Connect to the database server located at hostname.


       db-user = username
              Use username when authenticating with the database server.


       db-password = password
              Use password when authenticating with the database server.


       database = name (`mydns')
              Read resource record information from the database called name.
              The specified dbuser must have SELECT privileges on the
              specified database.



GENERAL OPTIONS
       The following configuration variables control the general behavior of
       the name daemon.


       user = username (`nobody')
              Run the name daemon with the permissions of user username.


       group = groupname (`nogroup')
              Run the name daemon with the permissions of group groupname.


       listen = address (`*')
              The name daemon should listen on address.  If address is *,
              listen on all addresses.  This must be an IP address in numbers-
              and-dots format, or *.  Multiple addresses may be specified,
              either separated by commas, or listed on separate listen lines,
              or both.  If a port number other than port 53 is desired, append
              `:port' to the address.


       no-listen = address (`*')
              The name daemon should NOT listen on address, even if it was
              specified by listen.  This must be an IP address in numbers-and-
              dots format, or *.  Multiple addresses may be specified, either
              separated by commas, or listed on separate listen lines, or
              both.  If a port number other than port 53 is desired, append
              `:port' to the address.




CACHE OPTIONS
       The following configuration variables affect the cache used internally
       by the name daemon.


       zone-cache-size = number (`4096')
              The zone data cache will not contain more than number entries.
              The average entry in the cache is about 128 bytes.  If number is
              0, the zone data cache will not be used.


       zone-cache-expire = seconds (`60')
              Entries expire from the zone data cache once they are seconds
              old.  If seconds is 0, the zone data cache will not be used.  If
              the TTL for any RR in the zone is less than the cache expire
              time, the TTL will be honored.


       reply-cache-size = number (`1024')
              The reply cache will not contain more than number entries.  The
              average entry in the cache is about 128 bytes.  If number is 0,
              the reply cache will not be used.


       reply-cache-expire = seconds (`30')
              Entries expire from the reply cache once they are seconds old.
              If seconds is 0, the reply cache will not be used.



ESOTERICA
       The following configuration variables affect the name daemon also, but
       most users will not need to use them.


       log = facility (`LOG_DAEMON')
              The name daemon should log via syslog facility facility.
              facility may be LOG_DAEMON or LOG_LOCAL0 through LOG_LOCAL7.  If
              facility is stderr, program output will go to stderr only.


       pidfile = filename (`/var/run/named.pid')
              Create a PID file for the name daemon called filename.


       timeout = seconds (`120')
              Incoming queries time out if a reply could not be sent after
              seconds have elapsed.


       multicpu = cpucount (`1')
              Run with multiple processes to support cpucount number of
              processors.- deprecated use servers instead


       servers = servercount (`1')
              Number of server processors to run. Set this to 0 to run just a
              single process, 1 will run a master and a server process. n runs
              n servers plus a master.  It is recommended that this be set to
              the number of CPUS times 2 plus 1.


       recursive = address
              If this option is specified, address is the address of a DNS
              server that accepts recursive queries.  If MyDNS receives a
              query where recursion is desired, and the zone is not local,
              MyDNS will forward the query to the server at address and return
              the result to the client.


       recursive-timeout = seconds (`60')
              Number of seconds to wait before first retry


       recursive-retries = count (`5')

              Should TCP requests be allowed?  (not recommended)


       allow-update = bool (`no')
              Should DNS-based zone updates (RFC 2136) be allowed?


       ignore-minimum = bool (`no')
              Should MyDNS ignore the minimum TTL for zones?


       soa-table = name (`soa')
              The name of the table containing SOA records.


       rr-table = name (`rr')
              The name of the table containing resource record data.


       use-soa-active = boolean (`yes')
              Where there is an soa-active column use this to determine which
              zones to serve.


       use-rr-active = boolean (`yes')

       notify-source = IPv4 address (`0.0.0.0')
              IPv4 address from which NOTIFY messages will be sent - set to
              0.0.0.0 or leave blank for the default of using the outgoing
              interface address.


       notify-source6 = IPv6 address (`;;')
              IPv6 address from which NOTIFY messages will be sent - set to ::
              or leave blank for the default of using the outgoing interface
              address.


       notify-timeout = seconds (`60')
              Number of seconds before first retry of NOTIFY message


       notify-retries = count (`5')
              Number of times to retry the NOTIFY message before giving up.


       notify-algorithm = string (`linear')

              each timeout is equal to notify-timeout, Exponential - double
              timeout on each retry, Progressive - increase timeout by number
              of retries.


       ixfr-enabled = boolean (`yes')
              Enable IXFR functionality - requires DB schema change as well.


       ixfr-gc-enabled = boolean (`yes')
              Enable real-time IXFR garbage collection facility. With this
              switched on the server will periodically scan the database for
              expired records that have been marked deleted and will remove
              them from the DB.


       ixfr-gc-interval = seconds (`86400')
              Number of seconds between each GC scan. - default 86400 seconds
              = 1 day.


       ixfr-gc-delay
              Number of seconds before first GC scan. - default 600 seconds =
              10 minutes.


       extended-data-support = boolean (`no')
              Switch on extended data support, this allow resource records to

              from the `rr' table.


       wildcard-recursion = number of ancestor levels
              Allow the server to look in ancestor zones for wildcard matches.
              This specifies how many levels to scan up before giving up. Use
              '0' (the default) to switch this off, a positive number to
              specify how many levels and '-1' for infinite.  [Caveat: Using
              this feature in the current release 1.2.8 will affect
              performance if you have deeply nested zones and search many
              levels. You have been warned, if you need to do this then
              increase the number of 'servers']


       debug-<module> = <debug level>
              Switches on module based debug for the module in question.  The
              debug level sets the volume and detail of messages produced.
              See output of --dump-config option for modules available.


SECURITY
       The mydns.conf file should be readable only by the root user (uid=0)
       since it typically contains a username and password allowing access to
       your database.
