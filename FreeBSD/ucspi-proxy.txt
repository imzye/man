ucspi-proxy-http-xlate(1)                      FreeBSD General Commands Manual

NAME
       ucspi-proxy-http-xlate - Translating HTTP proxy

SYNOPSIS
       ucspi-proxy-http-xlate [ -v ] search replace [ search replace [...]]

DESCRIPTION
       ucspi-proxy-http-xlate is a HTTP proxy for a UCSPI client/server pair
       that can translate strings within HTTP content on the fly.  All
       occurrences of search are replaced with replace.  If the HTTP response
       from the server contained a Content-Length header, it is replaced with
       the length of the translated content.

SEE ALSO
       ucspi-proxy(1)

CAVEATS
       All content is translated.  This could cause some odd side-effects if a
       search string is found in a binary response, such as an image.
