NAME
       mygpo-bpsync - Synchronize BashPodder subscriptions with gpodder.net

SYNOPSIS
       mygpo-bpsync (put|get) [device-id]


DESCRIPTION
       bpsync is a simple gpodder.net client application for syncing a
       BashPodder (http://lincgeek.org/bashpodder/) subscription list from and
       to the web service. As BashPodder uses a simple one-URL-per-line
       subscription list format, this script can be used with other
       applications, too (or to simply backup gpodder.net subscription URLs as
       plain text file).


       If you have added a subscription on gpodder.net, you can use the get
       sub-command to overwrite the local subscription list with the list
       stored on gpodder.net. If you have added a subscription locally, you
       can use the put sub-command to overwrite the list on gpodder.net with
       the list stored in the BashPodder subscription list.
