NAME
       spipe - spiped client utility

SYNOPSIS
       spipe -t <target socket> -k <key file> [-b <bind address>] [-f | -g]
       [-j] [-o <connection timeout>]
       spiped -v

OPTIONS
       -t <target socket>
              Address to which spipe should connect.  Must be in one of the
              following formats:

       •      /absolute/path/to/unix/socket

       •      host.name:port

       •      [ip.v4.ad.dr]:port

       •      [ipv6::addr]:port

       -k <key file>
              Use the provided key file to authenticate and encrypt.  Pass "-"
              to read from standard input.  Note that reading the key via
              standard input will make it impossible to read anything else via
              standard input, thereby limiting spipe to receiving data but not
              sending any.

       -b <bind address>
              Bind the outgoing address.  If this is a network address, the
              port number may either be specified or left to the operating
              system.  If you specify the port number, the operating system
              will not permit you to open a second connection until the first
              one has completely expired (i.e. the TCP state is no longer in
              the TIME-WAIT state).

       -f     Use fast/weak handshaking: This reduces the CPU time spent in
              the initial connection setup by disabling the Diffie-Hellman
              handshake, at the expense of losing perfect forward secrecy.

       -g     Require perfect forward secrecy by dropping connections if the
              other host is using the -f option.

       -j     Disable transport layer keep-alives.  (By default they are
              enabled.)

       -o <connection timeout>
              Timeout, in seconds, after which an attempt to connect to the
              target or a protocol handshake will be aborted (and the
              connection dropped) if not completed.  Defaults to 5s.

       -v     Print version number.
