DESCRIPTION
       ati is an Xorg wrapper driver for ATI video cards.  It autodetects
       whether your hardware has a Radeon, Rage 128, or Mach64 or earlier
       class of chipset, and loads the radeon(4x), r128(4x), or mach64 driver
       as appropriate.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
       The ati driver supports Radeon, Rage 128, and Mach64 and earlier
       chipsets by loading those drivers.  See those manpages for specific
       cards supported.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for general configuration details, and the
       specific card driver for driver configuration details.
