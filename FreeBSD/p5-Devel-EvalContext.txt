Devel::EvalContext(3)                      User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Devel::EvalContext - Save lexicals and hints between calls to eval

SYNOPSIS
         use Devel::EvalContext;
         my $cxt = Devel::EvalContext->new;
         $cxt->run(q{ my $a = 5; });
         $cxt->run(q{ print $a; });

DESCRIPTION
       Sometimes it's necessary to run some code that creates lexicals and
       then run more code that uses the same ones.  Perhaps it's in an
       interactive development environment.

       However, unlike Scheme, perl's eval primitive doesn't take an extra
       parameter to specify the environment to evaluate inside of.  This
       module corrects this deficit.

METHODS
   new
       Create a new, empty context.  It has no lexicals and hints are set to
       zero.

   run
       Equivalent to eval but with a context specified.
