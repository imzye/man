       service

SYNOPSIS
       use Net::Amazon::Thumbnail;

               my %conf = (
               key_id  => "YoursecretkeyID",
                   access_key  => "Yoursecretaccesskey",
               size    => "Large",

               my $images = $thumb->get_thumbnail('amazon.com');

               # Request multiple thumbnails
               my @domains = ('http://perlmonks.org', 'http://perl.com');
               $images = $thumb->get_thumbnail(\@domains);

               # Request with custom name (when path is provided)

DESCRIPTION
       The Net::Amazon::Thumbnail module allows you to use the Amazon Alexa
       Site Thumbnail web service with relative ease.

       The Alexa Site Thumbnail web service provides developers with
       programmatic access to thumbnail images for the home pages of web
       sites. It offers access to Alexa's large and growing collection of
       images, gathered from its comprehensive web crawl. This web service
       enables developers to enhance web sites, search results, web
       directories, blog entries, and other web real estate with Alexa
       thumbnails images.

       In order to access the Alexa Web Information Service, you will need an
       Amazon Web Services Subscription ID. See
       http://www.amazon.com/gp/aws/landing.html

       There are some limitations, so be sure to read the The Amazon Alexa Web
       Information Service FAQ.

INTERFACE
       The interface follows. Most of this documentation was copied from the
       API reference. Upon errors, an exception is thrown.

   new
       The constructor method creates a new Net::Amazon::Thumbnail object. You
       must pass in a hash reference containing the Amazon Web Services Access
       Key ID, Secret Access Key, thumbnail size (small or large), and the
       name of your default empty image. Optionally you can also provide a
       path to store the images.

               my $thumb = Net::Amazon::Thumbnail->new(\%conf);

   Config
       The configuration options have just a few requirements.  The following
       keys are required:

       key_id
               key_id  => "YoursecretkeyID",

       access_key
               access_key  => "Yoursecretaccesskey",

       The following keys are optional

       size
               size    => "large",

           Size of the returned thumbnail (Small = 111x82 pixels, Large =
           201x147 pixels).  If this parameter is not specified it defaults to
           "Large".  The first letter of this paramater is automatically
           uppercased.

       path
               path    => "C:/dev/thumbs/",

           The location of where you want the thumbnails stored locally.  Dies
           upon unsuccessful directory test.

       no_image
           The default image you want returned for queued thumbnails.  If the
           thumbnail is not available, this is the image returned.  If the
           path option was given, non existant images are not stored.

               no_image    => "noimage.jpg"

   get_thumbnail
       The get_thumbnail method retrieves the thumbnails for the sites given,
       and returns an array reference containing the thumbnail(s) requested.

       This method only accepts one argument, which must be a reference.

       Flexible argument types:
       String (single domain)
                   my $images = $thumb->get_thumbnail('http://perlmonks.org');

       Array reference (multiple domains)
                   my @domains = qw(http://cpan.org, sourceforge.net);
                   my $images = $thumb->get_thumbnail(\@domains);

       Hash reference (multiple domains with custom names)
                   my %domains = (
                           perlmonks.org => 'monastery',
                           cpan.org        => 'cpan'
                   );
                   my $images = $thumb->get_thumbnail(\%domains);

       If the path option was given, it will return the stored image instead
       of the image hosted on Amazon.

   post_thumbnail
       The post_thumbnail is exactly the same as get method, except that it
       dispatches a "POST" request instead of a "GET" request.

       Although this method does work, the API says to use "GET" requests.
