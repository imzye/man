HCONF(4)               FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual               HCONF(4)

NAME
     hconf – MS Windows Precision Touchpad configuration driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device hconf
           device hid
           device hidbus

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           hconf_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The hconf driver provides support for generic MS Windows Precision
     Touchpad configuration collection.  It enables the host to configure two
     different aspects of the device.  One allows the host to select input
     mode, and the other allows the host to be selective in what is reported.

SYSCTL VARIABLES
     Next parameters are available as sysctl(8) variables.  Debug parameter is
     available as loader(8) tunable as well.

     dev.hconf.*.input_mode
             HID device input mode: 0 = mouse, 3 = touchpad.

     dev.hconf.*.surface_switch
             Enable / disable switch for surface: 1 = on, 0 = off.

     dev.hconf.*.buttons_switch
             Enable / disable switch for buttons: 1 = on, 0 = off.

     hw.hid.hconf.debug
             Debug output level, where 0 is debugging disabled and larger
             values increase debug message verbosity.  Default is 0.
