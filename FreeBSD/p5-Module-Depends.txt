Module::Depends(3)    User Contributed Perl Documentation   Module::Depends(3)


NAME
       Module::Depends - identify the dependencies of a distribution

SYNOPSIS
        use YAML;
        use Module::Depends;
        my $deps = Module::Depends->new->dist_dir( '.' )->find_modules;
        print "Our dependencies:\n", Dump $deps->requires;

DESCRIPTION
       Module::Depends extracts module dependencies from an unpacked
       distribution tree.

       Module::Depends only evaluates the META.yml shipped with a
       distribution.  This won't be effective until all distributions ship
       META.yml files, so we suggest you take your life in your hands and look
       at Module::Depends::Intrusive.

METHODS
   new
       simple constructor

   dist_dir
       Path where the distribution has been extracted to.

   find_modules
       scan the "dist_dir" to populate "libs", "requires", and
       "build_requires"

   libs
       an array reference of lib lines

   requires
       A reference to a hash enumerating the prerequisite modules for this
       distribution.

   configure_requires
       A reference to a hash enumerating the prerequisite modules to configure
       this distribution.

   build_requires
       A reference to a hash enumerating the modules needed to build the
       distribution.

   error
       A reason, if any, for failing to get dependencies.
