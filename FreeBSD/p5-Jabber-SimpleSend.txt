DESCRIPTION
       This module is a wrapper around Net::Jabber that allows you to do one
       thing simply - send Jabber messages.  It is useful for daemon
       processes, cron jobs or in any program that you want to be able to get
       your attention via Jabber.

METHODS
   send_jabber_mesage()
       You can call this method with either 5 scalar arguments or with a
       single reference to a hash. In the later case it takes a hash with the
       following keys,

       user
           Your JID, or at least the JID you want the program to use.

       password
           The password corresponding to the username above.

       target
           The JID you want to send the message to.

       subject
           The subject of the message.

       message
           The message (which can include newlines).

KUDOS
       Ryan Eatmon for doing the hard work and doing Net::Jabber, DJ Adams for
       answering my questions about Jabber in the past. Various CPAN authors
       for proving the usefulness of ::Simple modules.
