DESCRIPTION
       mouse is an Xorg input driver for mice.  The driver supports most
       available mouse types and interfaces, though the level of support for
       types of mice depends on the OS.

       The mouse driver functions as a pointer input device. Multiple mice are
       supported by multiple instances of this driver.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
       USB mouse
              USB (Universal Serial Bus) ports are present on most modern
              computers. Several devices can be plugged into this bus,
              including mice and keyboards.  Support for USB mice is platform
              specific.

       PS/2 mouse
              The PS/2 mouse is an intelligent device and may have more than
              three buttons and a wheel or a roller.  The PS/2 mouse is
              usually compatible with the original PS/2 mouse from IBM
              immediately after power up.  The PS/2 mouse with additional
              features requires a specialized initialization procedure to
              enable these features.  Without proper initialization, it
              behaves as though it were an ordinary two or three button mouse.

       Serial mouse
              There have been numerous serial mouse models from a number of
              manufacturers.  Despite the wide range of variations, there have
              been relatively few protocols (data format) with which the
              serial mouse talks to the host computer.

              The modern serial mouse conforms to the PnP COM device
              specification so that the host computer can automatically detect
              the mouse and load an appropriate driver.  This driver supports
              this specification and can detect popular PnP serial mouse
              models on most platforms.

       Bus mouse
              The bus mouse connects to a dedicated interface card in an
              expansion slot.  Some older video cards, notably those from ATI,
              and integrated I/O cards may also have a bus mouse connector.

       The interface type of the mouse can be determined by looking at the
       connector of the mouse.  USB mice have a thin rectangular connector.
       PS/2 mice are equipped with a small, round DIN 6-pin connector.  Serial
       mouse have a D-Sub female 9- or 25-pin connector.  Bus mice have either
       a D-Sub male 9-pin connector or a round DIN 9-pin connector.  Some mice
       come with adapters with which the connector can be converted to
       another.  If you are to use such an adapter, remember that the
       connector at the very end of the mouse/adapter pair is what matters.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Depending on the X server version in use, input device options may be
       set in either a xorg.conf file, an xorg.conf.d snippet or in the
       configuration files read by the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
       daemon, hald(1).

       Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for general configuration details and for
       options that can be used with all input drivers.  This section only
       covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The driver can auto-detect the mouse type on some platforms.  On some
       platforms this is limited to plug and play serial mice, and on some the
       auto-detection works for any mouse that the OS's kernel driver
       supports.  On others, it is always necessary to specify the mouse
       protocol in the config file.  The README document provided with this
       driver contains some detailed information about this.

       The following driver Options are supported:

       Option "Protocol" "string"
              Specify the mouse protocol.  Valid protocol types include:

                   Auto, Microsoft, MouseSystems, MMSeries, Logitech,
                   MouseMan, MMHitTab, GlidePoint, IntelliMouse,
                   ThinkingMouse, ValuMouseScroll, AceCad, PS/2, ImPS/2,
                   ExplorerPS/2, ThinkingMousePS/2, MouseManPlusPS/2,
                   GlidePointPS/2, NetMousePS/2, NetScrollPS/2, BusMouse,
                   SysMouse, WSMouse, USB, VUID, Xqueue.

              Not all protocols are supported on all platforms.  The "Auto"
              protocol specifies that protocol auto-detection should be
              attempted.  The default protocol setting is platform-specific.

       Option "Device" "string"
              Specifies the device through which the mouse can be accessed.  A
              common setting is "/dev/mouse", which is often a symbolic link
              to the real device.  This option is mandatory, and there is no
              default setting. The driver may however attempt to probe some
              default devices if this option is missing.  Property: "Device
              Node" (read-only).

       Option "Buttons" "integer"
              Specifies the number of mouse buttons.  In cases where the
              number of buttons cannot be auto-detected, the default value is
              3.  The maximum number is 24.

       Option "Emulate3Buttons" "boolean"
              Enable/disable the emulation of the third (middle) mouse button
              for mice which only have two physical buttons.  The third button
              is emulated by pressing both buttons simultaneously.  Default:
              on, until a press of a physical button 3 is detected.  Property:
              "Mouse Middle Button Emulation"

       Option "Emulate3Timeout" "integer"
              Sets the timeout (in milliseconds) that the driver waits before
              deciding if two buttons where pressed "simultaneously" when 3
              button emulation is enabled.  Default: 50.   Property: "Mouse
              Middle Button Timeout"

       Option "ChordMiddle" "boolean"
              Enable/disable handling of mice that send left+right events when
              the middle button is used.  Default: off.

       Option "EmulateWheel" "boolean"
              Enable/disable "wheel" emulation.  Wheel emulation means
              emulating button press/release events when the mouse is moved
              while a specific real button is pressed.  Wheel button events
              (typically buttons 4 and 5) are usually used for scrolling.
              Wheel emulation is useful for getting wheel-like behaviour with
              trackballs.  It can also be useful for mice with 4 or more
              buttons but no wheel.  See the description of the
              EmulateWheelButton, EmulateWheelInertia, XAxisMapping, and
              YAxisMapping options below.  Default: off.

       Option "EmulateWheelButton" "integer"
              Specifies which button must be held down to enable wheel
              emulation mode.  While this button is down, X and/or Y pointer
              movement will generate button press/release events as specified
              for the XAxisMapping and YAxisMapping settings.  If set to 0, no
              button is required and any motion of the device is converted
              into wheel events.  Default: 4.

       Option "EmulateWheelInertia" "integer"
              Specifies how far (in pixels) the pointer must move to generate
              button press/release events in wheel emulation mode.  Default:
              10.

       Option "EmulateWheelTimeout" "integer"
              Specifies the time in milliseconds the EmulateWheelButton must
              be pressed before wheel emulation is started. If the
              EmulateWheelButton is released before this timeout, the original
              button press/release event is sent.  Default: 200.

       Option "XAxisMapping" "N1 N2"
              Specifies which buttons are mapped to motion in the X direction
              in wheel emulation mode.  Button number N1 is mapped to the
              negative X axis motion and button number N2 is mapped to the
              positive X axis motion.  Default: no mapping.

       Option "YAxisMapping" "N1 N2"
              Specifies which buttons are mapped to motion in the Y direction
              in wheel emulation mode.  Button number N1 is mapped to the
              negative Y axis motion and button number N2 is mapped to the
              positive Y axis motion.  Default: no mapping.

       Option "ZAxisMapping" "X"

       Option "ZAxisMapping" "Y"

       Option "ZAxisMapping" "N1 N2"

       Option "ZAxisMapping" "N1 N2 N3 N4"
              Set the mapping for the Z axis (wheel) motion to buttons or
              another axis (X or Y).  Button number N1 is mapped to the
              negative Z axis motion and button number N2 is mapped to the
              positive Z axis motion.  For mice with two wheels, four button
              numbers can be specified, with the negative and positive motion
              of the second wheel mapped respectively to buttons number N3 and
              N4.  Note that the protocols for mice with one and two wheels
              can be different and the driver may not be able to autodetect
              it.  Default: "4 5".

       Option "ButtonMapping" "N1 N2 [...]"
              Specifies how physical mouse buttons are mapped to logical
              buttons.  Physical button 1 is mapped to logical button N1,
              physical button 2 to N2, and so forth.  This enables the use of
              physical buttons that are obscured by ZAxisMapping.
              Default: "1 2 3 8 9 10 ...".

       Option "FlipXY" "boolean"
              Enable/disable swapping the X and Y axes.  This transformation
              is applied after the InvX, InvY and AngleOffset transformations.
              Default: off.

       Option "InvX" "boolean"
              Invert the X axis.  Default: off.

       Option "InvY" "boolean"
              Invert the Y axis.  Default: off.

       Option "AngleOffset" "integer"
              Specify a clockwise angular offset (in degrees) to apply to the
              pointer motion.  This transformation is applied before the
              FlipXY, InvX and InvY transformations.  Default: 0.

       Option "SampleRate" "integer"
              Sets the number of motion/button events the mouse sends per
              second.  Setting this is only supported for some mice, including
              some Logitech mice and some PS/2 mice on some platforms.
              Default: whatever the mouse is already set to.

       Option "Resolution" "integer"
              Sets the resolution of the device in counts per inch.  Setting
              this is only supported for some mice, including some PS/2 mice
              on some platforms.  Default: whatever the mouse is already set
              to.

       Option "Sensitivity" "float"
              Mouse movements are multiplied by this float before being
              processed. Use this mechanism to slow down high resolution mice.
              Because values bigger than 1.0 will result in not all pixels on
              the screen being accessible, you should better use mouse
              acceleration (see man xset) for speeding up low resolution mice.
              Default: 1.0

       Option "DragLockButtons" "L1 B2 L3 B4"
              Sets "drag lock buttons" that simulate holding a button down, so
              that low dexterity people do not have to hold a button down at
              the same time they move a mouse cursor. Button numbers occur in
              pairs, with the lock button number occurring first, followed by
              the button number that is the target of the lock button.

       Option "DragLockButtons" "M1"
              Sets a "master drag lock button" that acts as a "Meta Key"
              indicating that the next button pressed is to be "drag locked".

       Option "ClearDTR" "boolean"
              Enable/disable clearing the DTR line on the serial port used by
              the mouse.  Some dual-protocol mice require the DTR line to be
              cleared to operate in the non-default protocol.  This option is
              for serial mice only and is handled by the X server.  Default:
              off.

       Option "ClearRTS" "boolean"
              Enable/disable clearing the RTS line on the serial port used by
              the mouse.  Some dual-protocol mice require the RTS line to be
              cleared to operate in the non-default protocol.  This option is
              for serial mice only and is handled by the X server.  Default:
              off.

       Option "BaudRate" "integer"
              Set the baud rate to use for communicating with a serial mouse.
              This option should rarely be required because the default is
              correct for almost all situations.  Valid values include: 300,
              1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200.  Default: 1200.

       There are some other options that may be used to control various
       parameters for serial port communication, but they are not documented
       here because the driver sets them correctly for each mouse protocol
       type.
