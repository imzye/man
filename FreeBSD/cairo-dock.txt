CAIRO-DOCK(1)           FreeBSD General Commands Manual          CAIRO-DOCK(1)



NAME
       cairo-dock - A dock to launch your programs easily.


SYNOPSIS
       cairo-dock [options]


DESCRIPTION
       Cairo-Dock is a pretty, light and convenient interface to your desktop,
       able to replace advantageously your system panel!

       It features multi-docks, taskbar, launchers and a lot of useful
       applets.
       Applets can be detached from the dock to act as desktop widgets.
       Numerous ready-to-use themes are downloadable in 1 click, and can be
       easily customized at your convenience.
       It can use hardware acceleration (OpenGL) to be very fast and low on
       CPU.

       It's recommended to install the PLUG-INS package ( cairo-dock-plug-ins
       ) to have access to more views, dialogues and many plug-ins and
       applets.

       Some screenshots are available :

OPTIONS
       You can launch Cairo-Dock with several options :
       (Note : you can use these options in one block. For example :
       cairo-dock -oia )

       -c, --cairo
              Force Cairo backend. Use this option if you have issue with the
              OpenGL mode.

       -o, --opengl
              Force OpenGL backend. Cairo-Dock with OpenGL/Hardware
              acceleration.

       -O, --indirect-opengl
              Use OpenGL backend with indirect rendering. There are very few
              case where this option should be used.

       -A, --ask-backend
              Ask again on startup which backend to use.

       -l, --log [option]
              Log verbosity (options : debug, message, warning, critical,
              error - default is 'warning').
              For example : cairo-dock -l debug

       -F, --colors
              Force to display some output messages with colors even if these
              messages are not displayed into a tty.

       -w, --wait
              Wait for N seconds before starting. This is useful if you notice
              some problems when the dock starts with the session.

       -a, --keep-above
              Force to keep the dock above other windows.

       -s, --no-sticky
              Don't make the dock appear on all desktops.

       -e, --env
              Force the dock to consider this environment (gnome, xfce, etc.)
              - it may crash the dock if not set properly.

       -d, --dir
              Force the dock to load the configuration in this directory
              (default is ~/.config/cairo-dock).

       -m, --maintenance
              Allow to edit the config before the dock is started and show the
              config panel on startup.

       -x, --exclude
              Exclude a given plug-in from activating (it is still loaded
              though).

       -f, --safe-mode
              Don't load any plug-ins and show the theme manager on startup.

       -W, --metacity-workaround
              Work around some bugs in Metacity Window-Manager (invisible
              dialogs or sub-docks)

       -M, --modules-dir
              Ask the dock to load additional modules contained in this
              directory (though it is unsafe for your dock to load unofficial
              modules).

       -T, --testing
              For debugging purpose only. The crash manager will not be
              started to hunt down the bugs.

       -E, --easter-eggs
              For debugging purpose only. Some hidden and still unstable
              options will be activated.

       -S, --server
              Address of a server containing additional themes. This will
              overwrite the default server address.

       -k, --locked
              Lock the dock so that any modification is impossible for users.


OTHER
       Some other options with an output in the terminal :

       -v, --version
                 Print version and quit.

       -h, --help
                 Show the help and quit.
