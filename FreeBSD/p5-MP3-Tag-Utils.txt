ERROR RELATED METHODS
   error
       This returns the current error value.

       This returns a integer or undefined, Perl boolean value, indicating if
       a error is present or not and if it is which.

           if($foo->error){
               print "Error Code: ".$foo->error."\n";
           }

   errorString
       This turns the current error string.

           if($foo->errorString ne ''){
               print "Error String: ".$foo->errorString."\n";
           }

   errorblank
       This blanks a error, if a permanent error is not set.

       This is a internal method and there is no good reason to call it.
