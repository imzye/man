BSON_ALIGNED_ALLOC(3)               libbson              BSON_ALIGNED_ALLOC(3)

SYNOPSIS

          void *
          bson_aligned_alloc (size_t alignment, size_t num_bytes);

PARAMETERS

       • alignment: The alignment of the allocated bytes of memory. Must be a
         power of 2 and a multiple of sizeof (void *).

       • num_bytes: The number of bytes to allocate. Must be a multiple of
         alignment.

DESCRIPTION
       This is a portable aligned_alloc() wrapper.

       In general, this function will return an allocation at least
       sizeof(void*) bytes or bigger with an alignment of at least alignment.

       If there was a failure to allocate num_bytes bytes aligned to
       alignment, the process will be aborted.

       WARNING:
          This function will abort on failure to allocate memory.

RETURNS
       A pointer to a memory region which HAS NOT been zeroed.
