DSBDriverd(8)           FreeBSD System Manager's Manual          DSBDriverd(8)

NAME
     dsbdriverd – A device driver loading daemon

SYNOPSIS
     dsbdriverd [-l | -c vendor:device] | [-fn] [-x driver,...]

DESCRIPTION
     dsbdriverd is a daemon that automatically tries to find and load the
     suitable driver for your PCI and USB hardware. On startup dsbdriverd
     scans the PCI and US(B) bus for all connected devices and looks up their
     driver in a database and linker.hints files using information provided by
     the hardware. The same applies to USB devices attached to the system
     later at runtime.

     The options are as follows:

     -c      Check if there is a driver for the given vendor and device ID.

     -f      Run in foreground.

     -l      List installed devices and their corresponding driver.

     -n      Just show what would be done, but do not load any drivers, or
             call any Lua functions.

     -x      Exclude every driver in the comma separated list from loading.
             The list set via the -x flag takes precedence over the exclude
             list defined in the config file.
