NAME
       MooseX::MultiMethods - Multi Method Dispatch based on Moose type
       constraints

VERSION
       version 0.10

SYNOPSIS
           package Paper;    use Moose;
           package Scissors; use Moose;
           package Rock;     use Moose;
           package Lizard;   use Moose;
           package Spock;    use Moose;

           package Game;
           use Moose;
           use MooseX::MultiMethods;

           multi method play (Paper    $x, Rock     $y) { 1 }
           multi method play (Paper    $x, Spock    $y) { 1 }
           multi method play (Scissors $x, Paper    $y) { 1 }
           multi method play (Scissors $x, Lizard   $y) { 1 }
           multi method play (Rock     $x, Scissors $y) { 1 }
           multi method play (Rock     $x, Lizard   $y) { 1 }
           multi method play (Lizard   $x, Paper    $y) { 1 }
           multi method play (Lizard   $x, Spock    $y) { 1 }
           multi method play (Spock    $x, Rock     $y) { 1 }
           multi method play (Spock    $x, Scissors $y) { 1 }
           multi method play (Any      $x, Any      $y) { 0 }

           my $game = Game->new;
           $game->play(Paper->new, Rock->new);     # 1, Paper covers Rock
           $game->play(Spock->new, Paper->new);    # 0, Paper disproves Spock
           $game->play(Spock->new, Scissors->new); # 1, Spock smashes Scissors

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides multi method dispatch based on Moose type
       constraints. It does so by providing a "multi" keyword that extends the
       "method" keyword provided by MooseX::Method::Signatures.

       When invoking a method declared as "multi" a matching variant is being
       searched in all the declared multi variants based on the passed
       parameters and the declared type constraints. If a variant has been
       found, it will be invoked.  If no variant could be found, an exception
       will be thrown.
