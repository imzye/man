NAME
     vp – view image files

     vp [-fhlsvz] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     vp View Picture files using SDL. Supported file types include jpeg, gif,
     png, bmp, ppm, xpm, pcx, tga, and anything else your install of sdl_image
     supports. Keyboard controls are escape or q to quit, f to toggle
     fullscreen, z to toggle zoom (only in fullscreen), left arrow to go to
     the previous image, right arrow to go to the next image, and space to
     toggle slideshow. Toggling the zoom and fullscreen or using the arrow
     keys disables slideshow mode. File names starting with http:// or ftp://
     are interpreted as URL's and downloaded.
