NAME
       Module::Reload - Reload %INC files when updated on disk

SYNOPSIS
         Module::Reload->check;

DESCRIPTION
       When Perl pulls a file via "require", it stores the filename in the
       global hash %INC.  The next time Perl tries to "require" the same file,
       it sees the file in %INC and does not reload from disk.  This module's
       handler iterates over %INC and reloads the file if it has changed on
       disk.

       Set $Module::Reload::Debug to enable debugging output.

BUGS
       A growing number of pragmas ("base", "fields", etc.) assume that they
       are loaded once only.  When you reload the same file again, they tend
       to become confused and break.  If you feel motivated to submit patches
       for these problems, I would encourage that.

SEE ALSO
       Module::Reload::Selective is like this module, but lets you control
       which modules will be reloaded.

       again provides a slightly different mechanism for reloading changed
       modules, where you have to explicitly decide which modules to reload.

       Apache2::Reload (or Apache::Reload if you're still using Apache 1).

       perldoc require <http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/require.html> for
       details of how "require" works.
