SYSCTL(8)               FreeBSD System Manager's Manual              SYSCTL(8)

NAME
     sysctl – get or set kernel state

SYNOPSIS
     sysctl [-bdehiNnoTtqWx] [-B bufsize] [-f filename] name[=value[,value]]
            ...
     sysctl [-bdehNnoTtqWx] [-B bufsize] -a

DESCRIPTION
     The sysctl utility retrieves kernel state and allows processes with
     appropriate privilege to set kernel state.  The state to be retrieved or
     set is described using a “Management Information Base” (“MIB”) style
     name, described as a dotted set of components.

     The following options are available:

     -A      Equivalent to -o -a (for compatibility).

     -a      List all the currently available non-opaque values.  This option
             is ignored if one or more variable names are specified on the
             command line.

     -b      Force the value of the variable(s) to be output in raw, binary
             format.  No names are printed and no terminating newlines are
             output.  This is mostly useful with a single variable.

     -B bufsize
             Set the buffer size to read from the sysctl to bufsize.  This is
             necessary for a sysctl that has variable length, and the probe
             value of 0 is a valid length, such as kern.arandom.

     -d      Print the description of the variable instead of its value.

     -e      Separate the name and the value of the variable(s) with ‘=’.
             This is useful for producing output which can be fed back to the
             sysctl utility.  This option is ignored if either -N or -n is
             specified, or a variable is being set.

     -f filename
             Specify a file which contains a pair of name and value in each
             line.  sysctl reads and processes the specified file first and
             then processes the name and value pairs in the command line
             argument.

     -h      Format output for human, rather than machine, readability.

     -i      Ignore unknown OIDs.  The purpose is to make use of sysctl for
             collecting data from a variety of machines (not all of which are
             necessarily running exactly the same software) easier.

     -N      Show only variable names, not their values.  This is particularly
             useful with shells that offer programmable completion.  To enable
             completion of variable names in zsh(1) (ports/shells/zsh), use
             the following code:

                   listsysctls () { set -A reply $(sysctl -AN ${1%.*}) }
                   compctl -K listsysctls sysctl

             To enable completion of variable names in tcsh(1), use:

                   complete sysctl 'n/*/`sysctl -Na`/'

     -n      Show only variable values, not their names.  This option is
             useful for setting shell variables.  For instance, to save the
             pagesize in variable psize, use:

                   set psize=`sysctl -n hw.pagesize`

     -o      Show opaque variables (which are normally suppressed).  The
             format and length are printed, as well as a hex dump of the first
             sixteen bytes of the value.

     -q      Suppress some warnings generated by sysctl to standard error.

     -T      Display only variables that are settable via loader
             (CTLFLAG_TUN).

     -t      Print the type of the variable.

     -W      Display only writable variables that are not statistical.  Useful
             for determining the set of runtime tunable sysctls.

     -X      Equivalent to -x -a (for compatibility).

     -x      As -o, but prints a hex dump of the entire value instead of just
             the first few bytes.

     The information available from sysctl consists of integers, strings, and
     opaque types.  The sysctl utility only knows about a couple of opaque
     types, and will resort to hexdumps for the rest.  The opaque information
     is much more useful if retrieved by special purpose programs such as
     ps(1), systat(1), and netstat(1).

     Some of the variables which cannot be modified during normal system
     operation can be initialized via loader(8) tunables.  This can for
     example be done by setting them in loader.conf(5).  Please refer to
     loader.conf(5) for more information on which tunables are available and
     how to set them.

     The string and integer information is summarized below.  For a detailed
     description of these variable see sysctl(3).

     The changeable column indicates whether a process with appropriate
     privilege can change the value.  String and integer values can be set
     using sysctl.

EXIT STATUS
     The sysctl utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     For example, to retrieve the maximum number of processes allowed in the
     system, one would use the following request:

           sysctl kern.maxproc

     To set the maximum number of processes allowed per uid to 1000, one would
     use the following request:

           sysctl kern.maxprocperuid=1000

     Information about the system clock rate may be obtained with:

           sysctl kern.clockrate

     Information about the load average history may be obtained with:

           sysctl vm.loadavg

     More variables than these exist, and the best and likely only place to
     search for their deeper meaning is undoubtedly the source where they are
     defined.

COMPATIBILITY
     The -w option has been deprecated and is silently ignored.

HISTORY
     A sysctl utility first appeared in 4.4BSD.

     In FreeBSD 2.2, sysctl was significantly remodeled.

BUGS
     The sysctl utility presently exploits an undocumented interface to the
     kernel sysctl facility to traverse the sysctl tree and to retrieve format
     and name information.  This correct interface is being thought about for
     the time being.
