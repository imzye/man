id3ed(1)                FreeBSD General Commands Manual               id3ed(1)



NAME
       id3ed - edit id3 description tags in mpeg3 files

SYNOPSIS
       id3ed [-s songname] [-n artist] [-a album] [-y year] [-c comment] [-k
       tracknum] [-g genre] [-q] [-SNAYCKG] [-l] [-L] [-r] [-i] [-v] files...

DESCRIPTION
       id3ed edits the "id3" tag for mpeg layer3 files.  The mpeg3
       specification does not provide any method for storing song information,
       however the id3 tag has become a standard method for doing this, and
       most mp3 players can read the tag.  It will not cause any errors in
       players that do not support it.  The tag is 128 bytes long and is
       located at the end of the file.

       The -[snayckg] options can be used to set default values for each field
       of the id3 tag.  With -q, these options can be used to set some or all
       of the id3 fields to a certain value without prompting for editing.
       Specifing -q twice will disable the printing of which files are
       modified.

       The -[SNAYCKG] options allow you to edit only the tags you wish.  Other
       tags can still be set with their respective options.  For example, if
       you have a bunch of songs off of a single cd, most of the info is the
       same, and you will probably only want to set the songname manually for
       each track:
       id3ed -n SomeArtist -a SomeAlbum -y Someyear -S *.mp3

       Genres can be entered either using their name or code number.  To match
       by name however, it must match exactly (case insensitive).  -l displays
       a listing of known genres.  -L displays the same list, but in a
       row/column order rather than column/row.  Unknown genres can be used by
       specifying their code.  255 is the generally accepted code for
       "unknown".

       Tags can be removed from files with the -r option.  Only files that
       actually have a tag in them will be modified.  The -q option will
       disable the printing of which files had tags removed.  The -i option
       will list the tags in files.

       The version and license information can be viewed with the -v option.

NOTES
       In interactive mode, if you do not have readline, specifying an empty
       string is interpeted as keeping the value the same.  If you wish to
       actually clear the value of the current tag, use the EOT char, ctrl-d.
       (If you are using readline, the input is automatically set to the
       current value, so erasing it and hitting enter is interpeted as
       clearing the tag.)

BUGS
       There is no sanity checking of mp3 files, id3ed will happily add tags
       to any files you tell it to.
