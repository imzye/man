NAME
       Tree::Suffix - Perl interface to the libstree library.

SYNOPSIS

           $count = $tree->insert(@strings);
           $count = $tree->remove(@strings);

           $count = $tree->find($string);
           $count = $tree->match($string);

DESCRIPTION
       The "Tree::Suffix" module provides an interface to the C library
       libstree, which implements generic suffix trees.

       NOTICE: as libstree has outstanding bugs and has long been abandoned,
       this distribution is not being maintained.

METHODS
       $tree = Tree::Suffix->new
       $tree = Tree::Suffix->new(@strings)
           Creates a new Tree::Suffix object. The constructor will accept a
           list of strings to be inserted into the tree.

       $tree->allow_duplicates($bool)
           Determines whether duplicate strings are permitted in the tree.  By
           default, duplicates are allowed.  Note, this must be called before
           strings are inserted for it to have an effect.  Returns the value
           of the flag.

       $tree->insert(@strings)
           Inserts the list of strings into the tree, excluding duplicates if
           they are not allowed.  Returns the number of successfull
           insertions.

       $tree->remove(@strings)
           Remove the list of strings from the tree, including duplicates if
           they are allowed.  Returns the number of successful removals.

       $tree->find($string)
       $tree->match($string)
       $tree->search($string)
           In scalar context, returns the number of occurrences of the
           substring in the tree.  In list context, returns the positions of
           all occurrences of the given string as a list of array references
           in the form [string_index, start, end].

       $tree->string($string_index)
       $tree->string($string_index, $start)
       $tree->string($string_index, $start, $end)
           Returns the string at index_id.  The start and end positions may be
           specified to return a substring.

       $tree->lcs
       $tree->lcs($min_len, $max_len)
       $tree->longest_common_substrings
           Returns a list of the longest common substrings. The minimum and
           maximum length of the considered substrings may be specified.

       $tree->lrs
       $tree->lrs($min_len, $max_len)
       $tree->longest_repeated_substrings
           Returns a list of the longest repeated substrings. The minimum and
           maximum length of the considered substrings may be specified.

       $tree->strings
           In scalar context, returns the total number of strings in the tree.
           In list context, returns the list of string indexes.

       $tree->nodes
           Returns the total number of nodes in the tree.

       $tree->clear
           Removes all strings from the tree.

       $tree->dump
           Prints a representation of the tree to STDOUT.

EXAMPLE
       To find the longest palindrome of a string:

           use Tree::Suffix;
           $str   = 'mississippi';
           $tree  = Tree::Suffix->new($str, scalar reverse $str);
           ($pal) = $tree->lcs;
           print "Longest palindrome: $pal\n";

       This would print:

           Longest palindrome: ississi
