PROPERTIES(3)          FreeBSD Library Functions Manual          PROPERTIES(3)

NAME
     properties_read, property_find, properties_free – functions to allow
     creating simple property lists from ASCII file data

LIBRARY
     System Utilities Library (libutil, -lutil)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <libutil.h>

     properties
     properties_read(int fd);

     char *
     property_find(properties list, const char *name);

     void
     properties_free(properties list);

DESCRIPTION
     typedef struct _properties {
             struct _properties *next;
             char *name;
             char *value;
     } *properties;

     The function properties_read() reads name = value pairs from the file
     descriptor passed in fd and returns the head of a new property list,
     assuming that the file's contents have been parsed properly, or NULL in
     case of error.

     The property_find() function returns the associated value string for the
     property named name if found, otherwise NULL.  The value returned may be
     up to PROPERTY_MAX_VALUE bytes in length.

     The properties_free() function is used to free the structure returned by
     properties_read() when it is no longer needed.

FILE FORMAT
     Each property in the file is assumed to have the format of name = value
     where name is an alphanumeric string (and any punctuation not including
     the `=' character) and value is an arbitrary string of text terminated by
     a newline character.  If newlines are desired, the entire value should be
     enclosed in { } (curly-bracket) characters.  Any line beginning with a #
     or ; character is assumed to be a comment and will be ignored.
