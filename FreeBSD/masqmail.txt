NAME
       mservdetect - Helper for masqmail in combination with masqdialer



SYNOPSIS
       /usr/bin/mservdetect host port



DESCRIPTION
       Mservdetect is a small helper application for masqmail to detect its
       online status through the modem server masqdialer.  It connects to host
       at port, speaking the masqdialer protocol, and finally prints the
       active connection name, if any, to stdout.

       If you want to use it, set online_query="/usr/bin/mservdetect host
       port" in masqmail.conf.

              The hostname where the masqdialer server is running.
