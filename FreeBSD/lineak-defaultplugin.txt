NAME
       lineak_defaultplugin - Macro plugin for the lineakd daemon


DESCRIPTION
       LinEAK, Linux support for Easy Access and Internet Keyboards, features
       X11 support, windowmanager independence, ability to configure all keys
       through GUI or .conf file, volume control and sound controls.

       This plugin contains macros that can be used in a configuration file
       that facilitate controlling of volume (through the pcm or standard
       mixer), cdrom eject, etc. These macros use to be a part of the lineakd
       daemon. However, since version 0.8 they have been separated out into
       this plugin. The lineakd daemon no longer implicitly knows about
       configuration file macros.

       lineakd is the daemon that runs in the background of an X session and
       listens to incoming events from multimedia buttons.


MACROS
       The default plugin supports 11 Macros. Since lineakd 0.7 macros can
       also take one or more arguments.
       Macro definitions are as follows.

   EAK_MUTE, EAK_PCM_MUTE
       For the EAK_MUTE, EAK_PCM_MUTE macro. We have three forms that are
       acceptible.

       This is the default and original macro form. In this form you require a
       directive in your config file in order for the macro to know which
       mixer device to adjust.
            e.g. MixerDevice = /dev/mixer

       EAK_MUTE(X) EAK_PCM_MUTE(X)

       Here X is a number. The number is a volume to mute to. Currently this
       needs revisiting. If the number is too low it will merely change the
       balance. I suggest a value around 10000. I will fix this later so that
       it's a relative value from the minimum. In this form you require a
       directive in your config file in order for the macro to know which
       mixer device to adjust.
            e.g. MixerDevice = /dev/mixer

       EAK_MUTE(X,device,X2,device2,X3,device3,...)
       EAK_PCM_MUTE(X,device,X2,device2,X3,device3,...)

       X is a volume to mute to, and device is a string name of a mixer device
       (e.g. "/dev/mixer" to mute to. As with the previous macro, you will
       have to experiment with a good value.

   EAK_VOLUP, EAK_PCM_UP, EAK_VOLDOWN, EAK_PCM_DOWN
       For the EAK_VOLUP, EAK_PCM_UP and EAK_VOLDOWN, EAK_PCM_DOWN macros.
       Each have the following three forms.

       Increment or decrement the sound by the default amount. In this form
       you require a directive in your config file such as: MixerDevice =
       /dev/mixer in order for the macro to know which mixer device to adjust.

       EAK_VOLUP(X)
       EAK_PCM_UP(X) or EAK_VOLDOWN(X)
       EAK_PCM_DOWN(X)

       Increment or decrement the sound by X. This value is best used between
       1 and 5, and the sound modification code scales the value, unlike the
       MUTE macro. In this form you require a directive in your config file
       such as:  MixerDevice = /dev/mixer in order for the macro to know which
       mixer device to adjust.

       EAK_VOLUP(X,device,X2,device2,X3,device3,...)
       EAK_PCM_UP(X,device,X2,device2,X3,device3,...)
       EAK_VOLDOWN(X,device,X2,device2,X3,device3,...)
       EAK_PCM_DOWN(X,device,X2,device2,X3,device3,...)

       X is the volume to adjust the following device by. Like the previous
       form of this macro, a value of 1-5 is best.

   EAK_OPEN_TRAY, EAK_OPEN_TRAY_SCSI, EAK_CLOSE_TRAY
       For the EAK_OPEN_TRAY, EAK_OPEN_TRAY_SCSI and EAK_CLOSE_TRAY macros.
       There are two forms for each.  These are the default macros. It will
       eject or close the device defined in your config file as: CdromDevice =
       /dev/cdrom

       EAK_OPEN_TRAY(device1,device2,device3,...)
       EAK_OPEN_TRAY_SCSI(device1,device2,device3,...)
       EAK_CLOSE_TRAY(device1,device2,device3,...)


       This macro form allows you to choose the device to eject. You can have
       a list of one or more devices separated by a comma.


   EAK_SLEEP
       The EAK_SLEEP macro currently does nothing. In the future I will
       probably use it to invoke software suspend.


   EAK_SCREEN_LOCK
       For the EAK_SCREEN_LOCK macro. There is only one form.

       EAK_SCREEN_LOCK(X) Where X is either KDE, GNOME or XSCREENSAVER The
       values GNOME or XSCREENSAVER do the same thing. They invoke the
       Xscreensaver program to lock the desktop.


   EAK_MEDIADETECT(COMMAND)
       This macro allows you to use the media detect plugin to run one of the
       supported commands. This plugins requires that you have a configuration
       file in your ~/.lineak directory called media-detect.conf

       Valid commands are:

       PLAY
       STOP
       PAUSE
       PLAYPAUSE
       NEXT
       PREVIOUS

       See the media-detect.conf file in this source package for detailed
       configuration information.


   EAK_SENDKEYS("<options>")
          <options> := <modifers>+<character>
          <modifiers> := <modifier>[+<modifier>]
          <character> := A single alphanumeric character, (i.e. 0-9 or a-z) or
                         an arrow key (Right, Left, Up, Down) or other
       printible character.
          <modifier> := A modifier such as shift, control or alt.

       For example: "shift+a" or "control+shift+f"

       This macro allows you to send events to X. You can send a single
       character, such as a,b or c, or you can send combinations of keys. If
       you send key combinations, all of the previous keys must be modifiers
       such as shift, control or alt. All modifiers must precede the character
       you wish to send.



       More Examples:

       To send the '$' key, your options would be: shift+4
       To and alt+tab combination, your options would be: alt+Tab
       To send a capital a 'A', your options would be: shift+a
