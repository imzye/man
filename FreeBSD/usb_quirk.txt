LOADER TUNABLE
     The following tunable can be set at the loader(8) prompt before booting
     the kernel, or stored in loader.conf(5).

     hw.usb.quirk.%d
             The value is a string whose format is:

                   "VendorId ProductId LowRevision HighRevision UQ_QUIRK,..."

             Installs the quirks UQ_QUIRK,... for all USB devices matching
             VendorId and ProductId which have a hardware revision between and
             including LowRevision and HighRevision.

             VendorId, ProductId, LowRevision and HighRevision are all 16 bits
             numbers which can be decimal or hexadecimal based.

             A maximum of 100 variables hw.usb.quirk.0, .1, ..., .99 can be
             defined.

             If a matching entry is found in the kernel's internal quirks
             table, it is replaced by the new definition.

             Else a new entry is created given that the quirk table is not
             full.

             The kernel iterates over the hw.usb.quirk.N variables starting at
             N = 0 and stops at N = 99 or the first non-existing one.

EXAMPLES
     After attaching a u3g device which appears as a USB device on ugen0.3:

           usbconfig -d ugen0.3 add_quirk UQ_MSC_EJECT_WAIT

     Enable a Holtec/Keep Out F85 gaming keyboard on ugen1.4:

           usbconfig -d ugen1.4 add_quirk UQ_KBD_BOOTPROTO

     To install a quirk at boot time, place one or several lines like the
     following in loader.conf(5):

           hw.usb.quirk.0="0x04d9 0xfa50 0 0xffff UQ_KBD_IGNORE"
