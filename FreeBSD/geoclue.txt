GEOCLUE CONFIGURATION(5)  FreeBSD File Formats Manual GEOCLUE CONFIGURATION(5)

NAME
       geoclue.conf - geoclue configuration parameters

SYNOPSIS
       Main configuration file: /usr/local/etc/geoclue/geoclue.conf
       Overwriting parameters files: /usr/local/etc/geoclue/conf.d

DESCRIPTION
       The main GeoClue configuration file 'geoclue.conf' specifies parameters
       that control the operation of geoclue. Parameters can be overwritten by
       placing configuration files in conf.d directory and applied in
       alphabetic order. Thus, a configuration file '90-config.conf' will
       overwrite parameters specified in another configuration file
       '50-config.conf' in the conf.d directory.

       All configurations settings below are mandatory and the defaults are
       what you see before you edit them in geoclue.conf. If you want to keep
       the default values around, copy and comment out the appropriate line(s)
       before changing them.

       Missing 'enable' key for a particular source in the main configuration
       file causes that source to be enabled by default. Adding 'enable' key
       setting to any further config file can overwrite this default.

AGENT CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
       [agent] is used to begin the agent configuration.

       whitelist
              Whitelist of desktop IDs (without .desktop part) of all agents
              we recognise, separated by a ';'.

              whitelist=geoclue-demo-agent;gnome-shell;io.elementary.desktop.agent-geoclue2

       [network-nmea]
              Network NMEA source configuration options

              enable=true
              Fetch location from NMEA sources on local network?

              nmea-socket=/var/run/gps-share.sock
              Use a nmea unix socket as the data source.  If not set, unix
              socket will not be used.

       [3g]
              3G source configuration options

              enable=true
              Enable 3G source

       [cdma]
              CDMA source configuration options

              enable=true
              Enable CDMA source

       [modem-gps]
              Modem GPS source configuration options

              enable=true
              Enable Modem-GPS source

       [wifi]
              WiFi source configuration options

              enable=true
              Enable WiFi source

              url=https://location.services.mozilla.com/v1/geolocate?key=YOUR_KEY
              URL to the WiFi geolocation service. If not set, defaults to
              Mozilla's Location Service with a hardcoded key. To use a custom
              key, uncomment this URL while changing YOUR_KEY to your MLS API
              key.

              submit-data=false Submit data to Mozilla Location Service
              If set to true, geoclue will automatically submit network data
              to Mozilla each time it gets a GPS lock.

              submission-url=https://location.services.mozilla.com/v2/geosubmit?key=YOUR_KEY
              URL to submission API of Mozilla Location Service

              submission-nick=geoclue
              A nickname to submit network data with. If empty, omitted from
              the submission. Otherwise, must be 2 to 32 characters long.
              Defaults to "geoclue".

       [compass]
              Compass configuration options

              enable=true
              Enable Compass

       [static-source]
              Static source configuration options.
              This source reads location from "geolocation" file in
              /usr/local/etc. While this file is constantly monitored for
              changes during geoclue operation, and the reported static
              location is updated accordingly, this source isn't meant for
              inputting a dynamically changing location to geoclue (please use
              the Network NMEA source for that).

              enable=true
              Enable the static source.
              If you make use of this source, you probably should disable
              other location sources in geoclue.conf so they won't override
              the configured static location.

APPLICATION CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
       Having an entry here for an application with allowed=true means that
       geoclue will not ask agent to authorize the application. This is to
       ensure that applications with built-in authorization mechanism (e.g web
       browsers) do not have to be bound to agents.

       If your application is denied access to location information and your
       operating system doesn't provide any mechanism to change that, it is
       likely a bug in your operation system (or geoclue). The solution is to
       report the issue with all details, rather than adding your application
       to this list.

       Format:
              [random-app]
              Desktop ID of application without .desktop part

              allowed=true|false
              Allowed access to location information?

              system=true|false
              Is application a system component?

              users=
              List of UIDs of all users for which this application is allowed
              location info access, separate by ';'. Keep it empty for
              allowing it for all users.

       Examples:
              [gnome-datetime-panel]
              allowed=true
              system=true
              users=

              [gnome-color-panel]
              allowed=true
              system=true
              users=

              [org.gnome.Shell]
              allowed=true
              system=true
              users=

              [io.elementary.desktop.agent-geoclue2]
              allowed=true
              system=true
              users=

              [epiphany]
              allowed=true
              system=false
              users=

              [firefox]
              allowed=true
              system=false
              users=

STATIC LOCATION FILE
   Basic format:
       The static location file in /usr/local/etc (used by the static source)
       is a text file consisting of the following:

       1      Latitude (floating point number; positive values mean north,
              negative south)

       2      Longitude (floating point number; positive values mean east,
              negative west)

       3      Altitude (floating point number; in meters)

       4      Accuracy radius (floating point number; in meters)

       These values need to be separated by newline characters.

   Additional format information:
       •      The '#' character starts a comment, which continues until the
              end of the current line.

       •      Leading and trailing white-space on each line is ignored.

       •      Empty lines (or containing just white-space or a comment) are
              ignored.

   Example:
       # Example static location file for a machine inside Statue of Liberty torch

       40.6893129   # latitude
       -74.0445531  # longitude
       96           # altitude
       1.83         # accuracy radius (the diameter of the torch is 12 feet)

   Notes:
       For extra security, the static location file can be made readable just
       by the geoclue user:
       # chown root /usr/local/etc/geolocation
       # chmod 600 /usr/local/etc/geolocation

CLIENT LIST
       Sending SIGUSR1 to a running geoclue process prints the current list of
       clients to the log.
