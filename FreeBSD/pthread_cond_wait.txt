PTHREAD_COND_WAIT(3)   FreeBSD Library Functions Manual   PTHREAD_COND_WAIT(3)

NAME
     pthread_cond_wait – wait on a condition variable

LIBRARY
     POSIX Threads Library (libpthread, -lpthread)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <pthread.h>

     int
     pthread_cond_wait(pthread_cond_t *restrict cond,
         pthread_mutex_t *restrict mutex);

DESCRIPTION
     The pthread_cond_wait() function atomically blocks the current thread
     waiting on the condition variable specified by cond, and releases the
     mutex specified by mutex.  The waiting thread unblocks only after another
     thread calls pthread_cond_signal(3), or pthread_cond_broadcast(3) with
     the same condition variable, and the current thread reacquires the lock
     on mutex.

RETURN VALUES
     If successful, the pthread_cond_wait() function will return zero.
     Otherwise an error number will be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     The pthread_cond_wait() function will fail if:

     [EINVAL]           The value specified by cond or the value specified by
                        mutex is invalid.

     [EPERM]            The specified mutex was not locked by the calling
                        thread.

     [EOWNERDEAD]       The argument mutex points to a robust mutex and the
                        process containing the previous owning thread
                        terminated while holding the mutex lock.  The lock was
                        granted to the caller and it is up to the new owner to
                        make the state consistent.

     [ENOTRECOVERABLE]  The state protected by the mutex is not recoverable.

     The pthread_cond_wait() function conforms to ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996
