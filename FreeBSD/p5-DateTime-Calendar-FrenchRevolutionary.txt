NAME
       DateTime::Calendar::FrenchRevolutionary - Dates in the French
       Revolutionary Calendar

SYNOPSIS
         use DateTime::Calendar::FrenchRevolutionary;

         # Use the date "18 Brumaire VIII" (Brumaire being the second month)
         $dt = DateTime::Calendar::FrenchRevolutionary->new( year  =>  8,
                                                             month =>  2,
                                                             day   => 18,
                                              );

         # convert from French Revolutionary to Gregorian...
         $dtgreg = DateTime->from_object( object => $dt );

         # ... and back again
         $dtrev = DateTime::Calendar::FrenchRevolutionary->from_object( object => $dtgreg );

DESCRIPTION
       DateTime::Calendar::FrenchRevolutionary    implements    the    French
       Revolutionary  Calendar.   This  module  implements  most  methods  of
       DateTime; see the DateTime(3) manpage for all methods.

HISTORICAL NOTES
   Preliminary Note
       The documentation  uses the  word décade (the  first "e"  having an
       acute  accent). This  French word  is  not the  translation of  the
       English  word  "decade"  (ten-year  period).  It  means  a  ten-day
       period.

       For  your  information, the  French  word  for  a ten-year  period  is
       décennie.

   Description
       The Revolutionary calendar was in  use in France from 24 November 1793
       (4 Frimaire  II) to 31  December 1805 (10  Nivôse XIV). An  attempt to
       apply  the  decimal rule  (the  basis of  the  metric  system) to  the
       calendar. Therefore, the week  disappeared, replaced by the décade. In
       addition, all months have exactly 3 décades, no more, no less.

       At first,  the year was  beginning on the  equinox of autumn,  for two
       reasons.  First, the  republic had  been established  on  22 September
       1792, which  happened to be the  equinox, and second,  the equinox was
       the symbol of equality, the day and the night lasting exactly 12 hours
       each. It  was therefore  in tune with  the republic's  motto "Liberty,
       Equality, Fraternity". But  it was not practical, so  Romme proposed a
       leap year rule similar to the Gregorian calendar rule.

       In his book The French Revolution, the XIXth century writer Thomas
       Carlyle proposes these translations for the month names:

       Vendémiaire -> Vintagearious
       Brumaire -> Fogarious
       Frimaire -> Frostarious
       Nivôse -> Snowous
       Pluviôse -> Rainous
       Ventôse -> Windous
       Germinal -> Buddal
       Floréal -> Floweral
       Prairial -> Meadowal
       Messidor -> Reapidor
       Thermidor -> Heatidor
       Fructidor -> Fruitidor

       Each month has  a duration of 30 days. Since a  year lasts 365.25 days
       (or so), five  additional days (or six on leap  years) are added after
       Fructidor. These days  are called Sans-Culottides.  For programming
       purposes, they are  considered as a 13th month  (much shorter than the
       12 others).

       There was also an attempt to decimalize the day's subunits, with 1 day
       = 10 hours, 1 hour = 100 minutes and 1 minute = 100 seconds.  But this
       reform was put on hold after two years or so and it never reappeared.

       Other reforms to decimalize the time has been proposed during the last
       part of  the XIXth  Century, but these  reforms were not  applied too.
       And they are irrelevant for this French Revolutionary calendar module.

METHODS
       Since  the week  has been  replaced by  the décade,  the corresponding
       method  names  still   are  "decade_number",  "day_of_decade",  etc.
       English  speakers, please  note that  this has  nothing to  do  with a
       10-year period.

       The module supports both  Anglo-Babylonian time (24x60x60) and decimal
       time.    The  accessors  for   ABT  are   "abt_hour",  "abt_minute",
       "abt_second"  and  "abt_hms", the  accessors  for  decimal time  are
       "hour",  "minute",   "second"  and  "hms".   The  "strftime"  and
       "iso8601"  methods use  only  decimal time.   The  ABT accessors  are
       provided to be historically correct, since the decimal time reform was
       never put  in force. Yet,  emphasis is on  decimal time because  it is
       more fun than sexagesimal time,  which anyhow can be obtained with the
       standard Gregorian "DateTime.pm" module.

   Constructors
       •   new(...)

           Creates a new date object. This class accepts the following
           parameters:

           •   "year"

               Year  number, mandatory. Year  1 corresponds  to Gregorian
               years late 1792 and early 1793.

           •   "month"

               Month  number, in the  range 1..12,  plus number  13 to
               designate the end-of-year additional days.

           •   "day"

               Day number,  in the range 1..30.  In the case of  additional
               days, the range is 1..5 or 1..6 depending on the year (leap
               year or normal).

           •   "hour", "minute", "second"

               Decimal hour number, decimal  minute number and decimal second
               number.  The hour is in the 0..9  range, both other parameters
               are in the 0..99 range. These parameters cannot  be specified
               with the sexagesimal time parameters "abt_"xxx (see below).

           •   "abt_hour", "abt_minute", "abt_second"

               Sexagesimal  hour number,  sexagesimal minute  number  and
               sexagesimal second number.  The hour is  in the 0..23 range,
               both other parameters are in the 0..59 range.  These parameters
               cannot be specified with the decimal time parameters (see
               above).

           •   "locale"

               Only the values  "fr" (French), "en" (English),  "es" (Spanish)
               and "it" (Italian)  are allowed. Default  is French. No other
               values are possible, even territory variants such as "fr_BE" or
               "en_US".

       •   from_epoch( epoch => $epoch )

           Creates a  date object from a  timestamp value. This  timestamp is
           the number of seconds since the computer epoch, not the calendar
           epoch.

       •   now( )

           Creates  a date  object that  corresponds to  the precise  instant
           the method is called.

       •   from_object( object => $object, ... )

           Creates a date  object by converting another object  from the
           DateTime suite.  The preferred way for calendar to calendar
           conversion.

       •   last_day_of_month( ... )

           Same as "new",  except that the "day" parameter  is forbidden and
           is automatically set to  the end of the month.  If the "month"
           parameter is 13 for the additional days, the  day is set to the end
           of the year, either the 5th or the 6th additional day.

       •   clone

           Creates a replica of the original date object.

       •   set( .. )

           This method can be used to change the local components of a date
           time, or  its locale.   This method  accepts  any parameter
           allowed by  the new() method.

           This  method performs  parameters validation  just as  is done  in
           the new() method.

   Accessors
       •   year

           Returns the year. %Y or %G in "strftime".

       •   month

           Returns the month in the 1..12 range. If the date is an additional
           day at  the end  of the  year, returns  13, which  is not  really
           a month number. %m or %f in "strftime".

       •   month_0

           Returns the month in the 0..11 range. If the date is an additional
           day at the end of the year, returns 12, which is not really a month
           number.

       •   month_name

           Returns the  French name of the  month or its  English translation.
           No other language is  supported yet.  For the additional  days at
           the end of  the  year,  returns  "jour  complémentaire",  the
           translation  of "additional day". %B in "strftime".

           Note: The  English translations for  the month names come  from
           Thomas Carlyle's book.

       •   month_abbr

           Returns a 3-letter abbreviation of  the month name. For the
           additional days at the  end of the year, returns  "S-C", because
           these additional days  were also  known as  the Sans-culottides.
           %b or  %h in "strftime".

       •   day_of_month, day, mday

           Returns the day of the month, from 1..30. %d or %e in "strftime".

       •   day_of_decade, dod, day_of_week, dow, wday

           Returns the day of the décade,  from 1..10. The "dow", "wday" and
           "day_of_week"  names   are  there   for  compatibility's   sake
           with "DateTime",  even   if  the  word   "week"  is  improper.   %u
           in "strftime", but not %w (because the value differs on décadi).

       •   day_name

           Returns  the  name of  the  current day  of  the  décade. %A  in
           "strftime".

       •   day_abbr

           Returns   the   abbreviated  name   of   the   current   day  of
           the décade. %a in "strftime".

       •   day_of_year, doy

           Returns the day of the year. %j in "strftime".

       •   feast, feast_short, feast_long, feast_caps

           Returns the  plant, animal, mineral  or tool associated with  the
           day.  The  default format is  "short". If  requested, you  can ask
           for the "long" format,  with a "jour  de..." prefix, or the  "caps"
           format, with the first  letter of the prefix and  feast
           capitalized.  Example: for 11 Vendémiaire, we have:

              feast, feast_short  pomme de terre
              feast_long          jour de la pomme de terre
              feast_caps          Jour de la Pomme de terre

           %Ej, %EJ, %Oj or "%*" in "strftime".

           Note: the  English translation for  the feasts comes mainly  from
           Alan Taylor's website "Preserving the French Republican Calendar".

       •   ymd, dmy, mdy

           Returns the  date in the  corresponding composite format.  An
           optional parameter  allows  you  to  choose  the  separator
           between  the  date elements. %F in "strftime".

       •   abt_hour, abt_minute, abt_min, abt_second, abt_sec

           Return  the corresponding  time elements,  using a  sexagesimal
           scale.  This is also sometimes known as the Anglo-Babylonian Time.

       •   hour, minute, min, second, sec

           Return the corresponding time elements, using a decimal scale, with
           10 hours per day, 100 minutes per hour and 100 seconds per minute.
           %H, %M and %S in "strftime".

       •   abt_hms

           Returns  a composite  string with  the three  time elements.  Uses
           the Anglo-Babylonian Time.  An optional  parameter allows you to
           choose the separator (":" by default).

       •   hms

           Returns  a composite  string with  the three  time elements.  Uses
           the decimal  time.   An  optional  parameter  allows  you  to
           choose  the separator (":" by default).

       •   iso8601

           Returns the  date and time  is a format  similar to what  ISO-8601
           has specified for the Gregorian calendar.

       •   is_leap_year

           Returns a true value if the year is a leap year, false else.

       •   decade_number, week_number

           Returns the décade number. %U, %V or %W in "strftime".

       •   decade, week

           Returns a 2-element list, with  the year number and the décade
           number.  Since the  décade is always  aligned with a  month and
           then  with a year, the year element is always the same as the
           date's year.  Anyhow, this is done for compatibility with
           DateTime's "week" method.

       •   utc_rd_values

           Returns the  current UTC Rata Die  days, seconds and  nanoseconds
           as a 3-element list.  This exists primarily to allow other calendar
           modules to create objects based on the values provided by this
           object.

       •   jd, mjd

           These  return the Julian  Day and  Modified Julian  Day,
           respectively.  The value returned is a floating point number.  The
           fractional portion of the number represents the time portion of the
           datetime.

       •   utc_rd_as_seconds

           Returns the current UTC Rata Die days and seconds purely as
           seconds.  This is useful when you need a single number to represent
           a date.

       •   local_rd_as_seconds

           Returns the current local Rata Die days and seconds purely as
           seconds.

       •   strftime( $format, ... )

           This  method  implements functionality  similar  to the  strftime()
           method in C.  However, if  given multiple format strings, then it
           will return multiple elements, one for each format string.

           See the strftime Specifiers section for a list of all possible
           format specifiers.

       •   epoch

           Return the UTC epoch value  for the datetime object.  Internally,
           this is  implemented  "epoch"  from   "DateTime",  which  in  turn
           calls "Time::Local",  which uses  the Unix  epoch even  on machines
           with a different epoch (such  as Mac OS).  Datetimes before  the
           start of the epoch will be returned as a negative number.

           Since epoch times cannot represent  many dates on most platforms,
           this method may simply return undef in some cases.

           Using your system's  epoch time may be error-prone,  since epoch
           times have such a limited range  on 32-bit machines.  Additionally,
           the fact that different  operating systems  have different epoch
           beginnings is another source of bugs.

       •   on_date

           Gives  a  few historical  events  that took  place  on  the same
           date (day+month, irrespective of the  year).  These events occur
           during the period of use  of the calendar, that is, no  later than
           Gregorian year 1805. The  related  events either  were  located  in
           France, or  were battles in which a French army was involved.

           This  method accepts  one  optional argument,  the  language. For
           the moment, only  "en" for English and  "fr" for French  are
           available. If not given, the method will use the date object's
           current locale.

           Not all eligible events are portrayed there. The events database
           will be expanded in future versions.

           Most  military events  are extracted  from Calendrier  Militaire, a
           book written by an anonymous author in VII (1798) or so. I guess
           there is  no longer  any  copyright attached.  Please  note that
           this is  a propaganda  book, which  therefore gives  a  very biased
           view of  the events.

   strftime Specifiers
       The following specifiers are allowed in the format string given to the
       strftime() method:

       •   %a

           The abbreviated day of décade name.

       •   %A

           The full day of décade name.

       •   %b

           The abbreviated month name, or 'S-C' for additional days
           (abbreviation of Sans-culottide, another name for these days).

       •   %B

           The full month name.

       •   %c

           The date-time,  using the  default format, as  defined by  the
           current locale.

       •   %C

           The century number (year/100) as a 2-digit integer.

       •   %d

           The day of the month as a decimal number (range 01 to 30).

       •   %D

           Equivalent to  %m/%d/%y.  This  is not a  good standard format  if
           you have want both Americans and  Europeans (and others) to
           understand the date!

       •   %e

           Like %d, the day of the month  as a decimal number, but a leading
           zero is replaced by a space.

       •   %f

           The month as a decimal number (1  to 13). Unlike %m, a leading zero
           is replaced by a space.

       •   %F

           Equivalent to %Y-%m-%d (the ISO 8601 date format)

       •   %g

           Strictly similar to  %y, since décades are always  aligned with the
           beginning of the year in this calendar.

       •   %G

           Strictly similar to  %Y, since décades are always  aligned with the
           beginning of the year in this calendar.

       •   %h

           Equivalent to %b.

       •   %H

           The hour as a decimal number using a 10-hour clock (range 0 to 9).
           The result is a single-char string.

       •   %I

           The hour  as a decimal number  using the numbers on  a clockface,
           that is, range 1 to 10. The result is a single-char string, except
           for 10.

       •   %j

           The day of the year as a decimal number (range 001 to 366).

       •   %Ej

           The feast for  the day, in long format ("jour de  la pomme de
           terre").  Also available as %*.

       •   %EJ

           The feast for  the day, in capitalised long format  ("Jour de la
           Pomme de terre").

       •   %Oj

           The feast for the day, in short format ("pomme de terre").

       •   %k

           The  hour (10-hour  clock) as  a decimal  number (range  0 to  9);
           the result is a 2-char string, the digit is preceded by a blank.
           (See also %H.)

       •   %l

           The hour  as read from a  clockface (range 1  to 10). The result
           is a 2-char string, the digit is preceded  by a blank, except of
           course for 10. (See also %I.)

       •   %L

           The year as  a decimal number including the  century. Strictly
           similar to %Y and %G.

       •   %m

           The month as a decimal number (range 01 to 13).

       •   %M

           The minute as a decimal number (range 00 to 99).

       •   %n

           A newline character.

       •   %p

           Either  `AM'  or  `PM' according  to  the  given  time value,  or
           the corresponding strings for the current locale.  Noon is treated
           as `pm' and midnight as `am'.

       •   %P

           Like %p but in lowercase: `am' or `pm' or a corresponding string
           for the current locale.

       •   %r

           The decimal time in a.m.  or  p.m. notation.  In the POSIX locale
           this is equivalent to `%I:%M:%S %p'.

       •   %R

           The  decimal time  in 10-hour  notation  (%H:%M). (SU)  For a
           version including the seconds, see %T below.

       •   %s

           The number of seconds since the epoch.

       •   %S

           The second as a decimal number (range 00 to 99).

       •   %t

           A tab character.

       •   %T

           The decimal time in 10-hour notation (%H:%M:%S).

       •   %u

           The day of the décade as a  decimal, range 1 to 10, Primidi being 1
           and Décadi being 10.  See also %w.

       •   %U

           The décade number of the current year as a decimal number, range 01
           to 37.

       •   %V

           The  décade  number (French  Revolutionary  equivalent  to the  ISO
           8601:1988 week number) of the current  year as a decimal number,
           range 01 to  37. Identical to %U,  since décades are aligned  with
           the beginning of the year.

       •   %w

           The day of the  décade as a decimal, range 0 to  9, Décadi being 0.
           See also %u.

       •   %W

           The décade number of the current year as a decimal number, range 00
           to 37. Strictly similar to %U and %V.

       •   %y

           The year as a decimal number without a century (range 00 to 99).

       •   %Y

           The year as a decimal number including the century.

       •   %Ey

           The year as a lowercase Roman number.

       •   %EY

           The year as a uppercase Roman  number, which is the traditional way
           to write years when using the French Revolutionary calendar.

       •   %z

           The   time-zone  as   hour  offset   from  UTC.    Required   to
           emit RFC822-conformant dates (using "%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %z").
           Since the module does not  support time zones, this gives  silly
           results and you cannot  be RFC822-conformant.  Anyway,  RFC822
           requires  the Gregorian calendar, doesn't it?

       •   %Z

           The  time  zone  or  name  or abbreviation,  should  the  module
           have supported them.

       •   %*

           The feast for the day, in long format ("jour de la pomme de
           terre").  Also available as %Ej.

       •   %%

           A literal `%' character.

PROBLEMS AND KNOWN BUGS
   Time Zones
       Only the floating time zone  is supported.  Time zones were created in
       the  late  XIXth  century,  at  a  time  when  fast  communication
       (railroads)  and instant  communication (electric  telegraph)  made it
       necessary.  But at this time, the French Revolutionary calendar was no
       longer in use.

   Leap Seconds
       They are not supported.

   I18N
       For  the  moment,  only  French,  English,  Spanish  and  Italian  are
       available. For the  English translation, I have  used Thomas Carlyle's
       book and Alan  Taylor's web site at kokogiak.com (see  below). Then, I
       have checked  some translations  with Wikipedia and  Jonathan Badger's
       French Revolutionary Calendar module written in Ruby.

       Some feast names are not translated, other's translations are doubtful
       (they are flagged with a question mark).  Remarks are welcome.

   Feasts
       The various  sources for  the feasts  are somewhat  contradictory. The
       most obvious  example if  the 4th  additional day,  which is  "Jour de
       l'opinion" (day of opinion) in some  documents and "Jour de la raison"
       (day of reason) in others.

       In addition, the sources have several slight differences between them.
       All of  them obviously include some  typos. [Annexe] is chosen  as the
       reference since it is the  definitive legislative text that officially
       defines names of days in  the French revolutionary calendar. This text
       introduces  amendments  to  the  original calendar  set  up  by  Fabre
       d'Églantine in [Fabre], and gives  in annex the amended calendar. When
       there is  a difference between  the amended calendar and  [Fabre] with
       amendments  (yes it  can happen!),  [Fabre] version  prevails. Obvious
       typos  in  [Annexe] (yes  it  can  happen!)  are preserved,  with  the
       exception  of accented  letters  because they  are  fuzzy rendered  in
       original prints, or  cannot be printed at all at  that time on letters
       in uppercase.

       The bracket  references refer  to entries in  the "SEE  ALSO" section,
       "Internet" subsection below.

SUPPORT
       Support for this module is provided via the datetime@perl.org email
       list. See <https://lists.perl.org/> for more details.

       Please   report  any   bugs   or  feature   requests   to  Github   at
       <https://github.com/jforget/DateTime-Calendar-FrenchRevolutionary>, and
       create an issue or submit a pull request.

       If you have no  feedback after a week or so, try to  reach me by email
       at JFORGET  at cpan  dot org.  The notification  from Github  may have
       failed to reach  me. In your message, please  mention the distribution
       name in the subject, so my spam  filter and I will easily dispatch the
