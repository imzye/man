FILES
       /etc/solfege
              if solfege is installed into /usr, or {prefix}/etc/solfege in
              all other cases.  System administrators can override the values
              in the default.config file. The most obvious values you might
              want to change is the sound setup.

       ~/.solfegerc
              This file is used to store most configuration values. While it
              is possible to edit the file by hand, everything you need can
              and should be done from the gui.

       ~/.solfege
              Statistics is stored in subdirectories below this dir.
