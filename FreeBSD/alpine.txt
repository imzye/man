       alpine - an Alternatively Licensed Program for Internet News and Email

SYNTAX
       alpine [ options ] [ address , address ]

       alpinef [ options ] [ address , address ]

DESCRIPTION
       Alpine is a screen-oriented message-handling tool.  In its default
       configuration, Alpine offers an intentionally limited set of functions
       geared toward the novice user, but it also has a large list of optional
       "power-user" and personal-preference features.  alpinef is a variant of
       Alpine that uses function keys rather than mnemonic single-letter
       commands.  Alpine's basic feature set includes:

              View, Save, Export, Delete, Print, Reply and Forward messages.

              Compose messages in a simple editor (Pico) with word-wrap and a
              spelling checker.  Messages may be postponed for later
              completion.

              Full-screen selection and management of message folders.

              Address book to keep a list of long or frequently-used
              addresses.  Personal distribution lists may be defined.
              Addresses may be taken into the address book from incoming mail
              without retyping them.

              New mail checking and notification occurs automatically every
              2.5 minutes and after certain commands, e.g. refresh-screen
              (Ctrl-L).

              On-line, context-sensitive help screens.

       Alpine supports MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions), an
       Internet Standard for representing multipart and multimedia data in
       email.  Alpine allows you to save MIME objects to files, and in some
       cases, can also initiate the correct program for viewing the object.
       It uses the system's mailcap configuration file to determine what
       program can process a particular MIME object type.  Alpine's message
       composer does not have integral multimedia capability, but any type of
       data file --including multimedia-- can be attached to a text message
       and sent using MIME's encoding rules.  This allows any group of
       individuals with MIME-capable mail software (e.g. Alpine, PC-Alpine, or
       many other programs) to exchange formatted documents, spread-sheets,
       image files, etc, via Internet email.

       Alpine uses the c-client messaging API to access local and remote mail
       folders. This library provides a variety of low-level message-handling
       functions, including drivers for a variety of different mail file
       formats, as well as routines to access remote mail and news servers,
       using IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) and NNTP (Network News
       Transport Protocol).  Outgoing mail is usually posted directly via SMTP
       (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).

OPTIONS

       The command line options/arguments are:

       address             Send mail to address.  This will cause Alpine to go
                           directly into the message composer.

       -attach file        Send mail with the listed file as an attachment.

       -attachlist file-list
                           Send mail with the listed file-list as an
                           attachments.

       -attach_and_delete file
                           Send mail with the listed file as an attachment,
                           and remove the file after the message is sent.

       -aux local_directory
                           PC-Alpine only. When using a remote configuration
                           (-p <remote_config>) this tells PC-Alpine the local
                           directory to use for storing auxiliary files, like
                           debug files, address books, and signature files.

       -bail               Exit if the pinerc file does not exist. This might
                           be useful if the config file is accessed using some
                           remote filesystem protocol. If the remote mount is
                           missing this will cause Alpine to quit instead of
                           creating a new pinerc.

       -c context-number   context-number is the number corresponding to the
                           folder-collection to which the -f command line
                           argument should be applied.  By default the -f
                           argument is applied to the first defined folder-
                           collection.

       -conf               Produce a sample/fresh copy of the system-wide
                           configuration file, alpine.conf, on the standard
                           output. This is distinct from the per-user .pinerc
                           file.

       -convert_sigs -p_pinerc
                           Convert signature files into literal signatures.

       -copy_abook <local_abook> <remote_abook>
                           Copy the local address book file to a remote
                           address book folder.

       -copy_pinerc <local_pinerc> <remote_pinerc>
                           Copy the local pinerc file to a remote pinerc
                           folder.

       -d debug-level      Output diagnostic info at debug-level (0-9) to the
                           current .pine-debug[1-4] file.  A value of 0 turns
                           debugging off and suppresses the .pine-debug file.

       -d key[=val]        Fine tuned output of diagnostic messages where
                           "flush" causes debug file writing without
                           buffering, "timestamp" appends each message with a
                           timestamp, "imap=n" where n is between 0 and 4
                           representing none to verbose IMAP telemetry
                           reporting, "numfiles=n" where n is between 0 and 31
                           corresponding to the number of debug files to
                           maintain, and "verbose=n" where n is between 0 and
                           9 indicating an inverse threshold for message
                           output.

       -f folder           Open folder (in first defined folder collection,
                           use -c n to specify another collection) instead of
                           INBOX.

       -F file             Open named text file and view with Alpine's
                           browser.

       -h                  Help: list valid command-line options.

       -i                  Start up in the FOLDER INDEX screen.

       -I keystrokes       Initial (comma separated list of) keystrokes which
                           Alpine should execute on startup.

       -install            For PC-Alpine only, this option causes PC-Alpine to
                           prompt for some basic setup information, then
                           exits.

       -k                  Use function keys for commands. This is the same as
                           running the command alpinef.

       -n number           Start up with current message-number set to number.

       -nowrite_password_cache
                           Read from a password cache if there is one, but
                           never offer to write a password to the cache

       -o                  Open first folder read-only.

       -p config-file      Use config-file as the personal configuration file
                           instead of the default .pinerc.

       -P config-file      Use config-file as the configuration file instead
                           of default system-wide configuration file
                           alpine.conf.

       -passfile <fully-qualified-path>
                           When password file support is compiled in, use the
                           file specified in <fully-qualified-path> instead of
                           the default.

       -pinerc file        Output fresh pinerc configuration to file,
                           preserving the settings of variables that the user
                           has made.  Use file set to ``-'' to make output go
                           to standard out.

       -pwdcertdir <fully-qualified-path>
                           When SMIME and password file support are compiled
                           in, this variable sets the directory to store your
                           personal key and certificate to encrypt and decrypt
                           your password file.

       -r                  Use restricted/demo mode.  Alpine will only send
                           mail to itself and functions like save and export
                           are restricted.

       -registry cmd       For PC-Alpine only, this option affects the values
                           of Alpine's registry entries.  Possible values for
                           cmd are set, clear, and dump.  Set will always
                           reset Alpine's registry entries according to its
                           current settings.  Clear will clear the registry
                           values.  Clearsilent will silently clear the
                           registry values.  Dump will display the values of
                           current registry settings.  Note that the dump
                           command is currently disabled.  Without the
                           -registry option, PC-Alpine will write values into
                           the registry only if there currently aren't any
                           values set.

       -smimedir <fully-qualified-path>
                           If SMIME is compiled in, this argument sets the
                           directory where the public, private, and
                           certificate authorities certificates and keys are
                           stored. If not set by the command line the default
                           is ~/.alpine-smime

       -sort order         Sort the FOLDER INDEX display in one of the
                           following orders: arrival, date, subject,
                           orderedsubj, thread, from, size, score, to, cc, or
                           reverse. Arrival order is the default.  The
                           OrderedSubj choice simulates a threaded sort.  Any
                           sort may be reversed by adding /reverse to it.
                           Reverse by itself is the same as arrival/reverse.

       -supported          Some options may or may not be supported depending
                           on how Alpine was compiled.  This is a way to
                           determine which options are supported in the
                           particular copy of Alpine you are using.

       -uninstall          For PC-Alpine only, this option causes PC-Alpine to
                           remove references to Alpine in Windows settings.

       -url url            Open the given url.  Cannot be used with -f or -F
                           options.

       -v                  Version: Print version information.

       -version            Version: Print version information.

       -x config           Use configuration exceptions in config.  Exceptions
                           are used to override your default pinerc settings
                           for a particular platform, can be a local file or a
                           remote folder.

       -xoauth2-server ServerName
                           Name of the service that XOAUTH2 authentication
                           will be attempted.  The only service supported as
                           of this writing is Gmail. Note that all of the
                           options -xoauth2-server, -xoauth2-client-id and
                           -xoauth2-client-secret must be used simultaneously.
                           Example: -xoauth2-server Gmail.

       -xoauth2-client-id Client-Id
                           String that identifies Alpine with the service
                           provider that provides XOAUTH2 authentication. Note
                           that all of the options -xoauth2-server,
                           -xoauth2-client-id and -xoauth2-client-secret must
                           be used simultaneously.

       -xoauth2-client-secret Client-Secret
                           Secret string that identifies the Alpine with the
                           service provider that provides XOAUTH2
                           authentication.  Note that all of the options
                           -xoauth2-server, -xoauth2-client-id and
                           -xoauth2-client-secret must be used simultaneously.

       -z                  Enable ^Z and SIGTSTP so alpine may be suspended.

       -option=value       Assign value to the config option option e.g.
                           -signature-file=sig1 or -feature-list=signature-at-
                           bottom (Note: feature-list values are additive)

CONFIGURATION
       There are several levels of Alpine configuration.  Configuration values
       at a given level over-ride corresponding values at lower levels.  In
       order of increasing precedence:

        o built-in defaults.
        o system-wide alpine.conf file.
        o personal .pinerc file (may be set via built-in Setup/Config menu.)
        o command-line options.
        o system-wide alpine.conf.fixed file.

       There is one exception to the rule that configuration values are
       replaced by the value of the same option in a higher-precedence file:
       the feature-list variable has values that are additive, but can be
       negated by prepending "no-" in front of an individual feature name.
       Unix Alpine also uses the following environment variables:

         TERM
         DISPLAY     (determines if Alpine can display IMAGE attachments.)
         SHELL       (if not set, default is /bin/sh )
         MAILCAPS    (semicolon delimited list of path names to mailcap files)
