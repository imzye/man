NAME
       "sepl" -- a Term::ReadLine-based Sepia interactive shell.

SYNOPSIS
           $ sepl
           Type ",h" for help, or ",q" to quit.
           main @> substr "hello, japh", 7
           'japh'
           main @>

DESCRIPTION
       "sepl" uses Sepia::ReadLine to provide an interactive Perl shell with
       many of the Sepia features available in Emacs, including completion and
       all shortcuts.  It is not well-tested or frequently used, and should be
       considered experimental.

SEE ALSO
       Sepia, Term::ReadLine.

       Most of "Sepia"'s documentation is installed in Emacs' "info" format.
       On most systems it can be read from the command-line by typing ""info
       sepia"".
