NAME
     pam_permit – Promiscuous PAM module

SYNOPSIS
     [service-name] module-type control-flag pam_permit [options]

DESCRIPTION
     The Promiscuous authentication service module for PAM, pam_permit
     provides functionality for all the PAM categories: authentication,
     account management, session management and password management.  In terms
     of the module-type parameter, these are the “auth”, “account”, “session”,
     and “password” features.

     The Promiscuous module will universally allow all requests.  It is
     primarily of use during testing, and to silence “noisy” PAM-enabled
     applications.

     The following options may be passed to the module:

     debug      syslog(3) debugging information at LOG_DEBUG level.
