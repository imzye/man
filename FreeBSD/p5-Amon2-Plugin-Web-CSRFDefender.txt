Amon2::Plugin::Web::CSRFDefender(3)        User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Amon2::Plugin::Web::CSRFDefender - Anti CSRF filter

SYNOPSIS
           package MyApp::Web;
           use Amon2::Web;

           __PACKAGE__->load_plugin('Web::CSRFDefender');

DESCRIPTION
       This plugin denies CSRF request.

       Do not use this with HTTP::Session2. Because HTTP::Session2 has XSRF
       token management function by itself.

METHODS
       $c->get_csrf_defender_token()
           Get a CSRF defender token. This method is useful to add token for
           AJAX request.

       $c->validate_csrf()
           You can validate CSRF token manually.

PARAMETERS
       no_validate_hook
           Do not run validation automatically.

       no_html_filter
           Disable HTML rewriting filter. By default, CSRFDefender inserts
           XSRF token for each form element.

           It's very useful but it hits performance issue if your site is very
           high traffic.

       csrf_token_generator
           You can change the csrf token generation algorithm.
