WWW::Scripter::Location(3)                 User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       WWW::Scripter::Location - Location object for WWW::Scripter

VERSION
       Version 0.032

METHODS
       hash
       host
       hostname
       href
       pathname
       port
       protocol
       search
           Each of these returns or sets the corresponding part of the URI.
           (Actually, "href" refers to the whole thing, not just a part.) If
           you set one of these, it tells the WWW::Scripter object to go to
           another page.

           What the location object shows as being the current URL includes
           the fragment (hash) if any, and can also be modified by
           "history->pushState". To get the real URL, use WWW::Scripter's
           "uri" method, which is inherited from WWW::Mechanize.

       reload
           Does what it says.

       replace ( $new_uri )
           Replaces the current page in Mech's history with $new_uri, which it
           tells Mech to go and fetch.
