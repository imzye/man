NAME
     plockstat – Trace pthread lock statistics using DTrace

SYNOPSIS
     plockstat [-vACHV] [-n count] [-s depth] [-e secs] [-x opt=val] command
               [arg...]
     plockstat [-vACHV] [-n count] [-s depth] [-e secs] [-x opt=val] -p pid

DESCRIPTION
     The plockstat utility traces pthread locks (mutexes and rwlocks) and
     prints statistics about them.  You can use plockstat to investigate
     bottlenecks in your software.

     The following options are available:

     -v      Be verbose.

     -A      Print all statistics.

     -C      Print commulative statistics (the default).

     -H      Print a histogram.

     -V      Print the DTrace script about to be used to stderr.

     -n count
             Set the aggregation count for the data set.

     -s depth
             Set the ustack (userland stack) caller depth.

     -e secs
             Does nothing at the moment.

     -x opt=val
             Specify DTrace options.  See the dtrace(1) man page for more
             details.

EXIT STATUS
     The plockstat utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
