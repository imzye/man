Graphics::Primitive(3)                     User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Graphics::Primitive - Device and library agnostic graphic primitives

SYNOPSIS
       Graphics::Primitive is a device and library agnostic system for
       creating and manipulating various graphical elements such as Borders,
       Fonts, Paths and the like.

           my $c = Graphics::Primitive::Component->new(
             background_color => Graphics::Color::RGB->new(
                 red => 1, green => 0, blue => 0
             ),
             width => 500, height => 350,
             border => new Graphics::Primitive::Border->new( width => 5 )
           );

           my $driver = Graphics::Primitive::Driver::Cairo->new(format => 'SVG');

           $driver->prepare($c);
           $driver->finalize($c);
           $driver->draw($c);

           $driver->write($filename)

DESCRIPTION
       Graphics::Primitive is library agnostic system for drawing things.

       The idea is to allow you to create and manipulate graphical components
       and then pass them off to a Driver for actual drawing.

CONCEPTS
       The root object for Graphics::Primitive is the Component.  Components
       contain all the common elements that you'd expect: margins, padding,
       background color etc.

       The next most important is the Container.  Containers are Components
       that can hold other Components.  Containers have all the attributes and
       methods of a Component with the addition of the layout_manager
       attribute for us with Layout::Manager.

       Another important Component is the Canvas.  The Canvas differs from
       other components by being a container for various Geometry::Primitive
       objects.  This allows drawing of arbitrary shapes that do not fit
       existing components.

DRAWING LIFECYCLE
       After creating all your components, there is a lifecycle that allows
       them to do their internal housekeeping to prepare for eventual drawing.
       The lifecycle is: prepare, layout and pack.  Detailed explanation of
       these methods can be found in Component.

PREPARATION
       Graphics::Primitive::Component has a "prepared" flag.  This flag is set
       as part of the "prepare" method (shocking, I know).  If this flag is
       set, then subsequent calls to "prepare" are ignored.  Containers also
       have a prepare flag, but this flag is not set when calling "prepare".
       A Container's flag should be set by the layout manager.  More
       information may be found with Layout::Manager.

INSPIRATION
       Most of the concepts that you'll find in Graphics::Primitive are
       inspired by Cairo <http://cairographics.org>'s API and CSS
       <http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/>'s box model.
