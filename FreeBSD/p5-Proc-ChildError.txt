Proc::ChildError(3)   User Contributed Perl Documentation  Proc::ChildError(3)


NAME
       Proc::ChildError - Explain process child error

VERSION
       This document describes version 0.04 of Proc::ChildError (from Perl
       distribution Proc-ChildError), released on 2016-01-06.

FUNCTIONS
   explain_child_error([\%opts, ]$child_error, $os_error) => STR
       Produce a string description of an error number. $child_error defaults
       to $? if not specified. $os_error defaults to $! if not specified.

       The algorithm is taken from perldoc -f system. Some sample output:

        failed to execute: No such file or directory (-1)
        died with signal 15, with coredump
        exited with value 3

       An options hashref can be specified as the first argument to add
       information.  Currently known keys:

       •   prog => str

           Program name/path, to include in error messages:

            /usr/bin/foo failed to execute: Permission denied (-1)
            foo died with signal 15, with coredump
            /usr/bin/foo exited with value 3

SEE ALSO
       Process::Status provides a lightweight OO interface for $?. I recommend
       this module now over Proc::ChildError.

       IPC::System::Simple provides a replacement for Perl's system(), with
       the difference that it will print a diagnostic error message similar to
       what "Proc::ChildError" provides. You only need to do use
       IPC::System::Simple qw(system) and use system() as usual. Recommended.
