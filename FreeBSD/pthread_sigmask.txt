PTHREAD_SIGMASK(3)     FreeBSD Library Functions Manual     PTHREAD_SIGMASK(3)

NAME
     pthread_sigmask – examine and/or change a thread's signal mask

LIBRARY
     POSIX Threads Library (libpthread, -lpthread)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <pthread.h>
     #include <signal.h>

     int
     pthread_sigmask(int how, const sigset_t * restrict set,
         sigset_t * restrict oset);

DESCRIPTION
     The pthread_sigmask() function examines and/or changes the calling
     thread's signal mask.

     If set is not NULL, it specifies a set of signals to be modified, and how
     specifies what to set the signal mask to:

     SIG_BLOCK    Union of the current mask and set.

     SIG_UNBLOCK  Intersection of the current mask and the complement of set.

     SIG_SETMASK  set.

     If oset is not NULL, the previous signal mask is stored in the location
     pointed to by oset.

     SIGKILL and SIGSTOP cannot be blocked, and will be silently ignored if
     included in the signal mask.

RETURN VALUES
     If successful, pthread_sigmask() returns 0.  Otherwise, an error is
     returned.

ERRORS
     The pthread_sigmask() function will fail if:

     [EINVAL]           how is not one of the defined values.
