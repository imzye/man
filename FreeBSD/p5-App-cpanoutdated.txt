NAME
       cpan-outdated - detect outdated CPAN modules in your environment

SYNOPSIS
           # print the list of distribution that contains outdated modules
           % cpan-outdated

           # print the list of outdated modules in packages
           % cpan-outdated -p

           # verbose
           % cpan-outdated --verbose

           # alternate mirrors
           % cpan-outdated --mirror file:///home/user/minicpan/

           # additional module path(same as cpanminus)
           % cpan-outdated -l extlib/
           % cpan-outdated -L extlib/

           # install with cpan
           % cpan-outdated | xargs cpan -i

           # install with cpanm
           % cpan-outdated    | cpanm
           % cpan-outdated -p | cpanm

DESCRIPTION
       This script prints the list of outdated CPAN modules in your machine.

       It's same feature of 'CPAN::Shell->r', but "cpan-outdated" is much
       faster and uses less memory.

       This script can be integrated with cpanm command.

PRINTING PACKAGES VS DISTRIBUTIONS
       This script by default prints the outdated distribution as in the CPAN
       distro format, i.e: "A/AU/AUTHOR/Distribution-Name-0.10.tar.gz" so you
       can pipe into CPAN installers, but with "-p" option it can be twaked to
       print the module's package names.

       For some tools such as cpanm installing from packages could be a bit
       more useful since you can track to see the old version number where you
       upgrade from.
