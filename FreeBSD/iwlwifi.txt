iwlwifi(4)             FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual             iwlwifi(4)

NAME
     iwlwifi – Intel IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax wireless network driver

SYNOPSIS
     The driver will auto-load without any user interaction using devmatch(8)
     if enabled in rc.conf(5).

     Only if auto-loading is explicitly disabled, place the following lines in
     rc.conf(5) to manually load the driver as a module at boot time:

           kld_list="${kld_list} if_iwlwifi"

     The driver should automatically load any iwlwififw(4) firmware needed for
     the particular chipset.

     It is discouraged to load the driver from loader(8).

DESCRIPTION
     The iwlwifi driver is derived from Intel's Linux iwlwifi driver and
     provides support for all chipsets supported by the mvm part of that
     driver.  iwlwifi will be a successor to iwm(4) and may superseed that
     driver in the future.  It still complements the iwn(4) driver which
     supports older chipsets.

     The driver uses the linuxkpi_wlan and linuxkpi compat framework to bridge
     between the Linux and native FreeBSD driver code as well as to the native
     net80211(4) wireless stack.

     While iwlwifi supports all 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax the compatibility code
     currently only supports 802.11 a/b/g modes.  Support for 802.11 n/ac is
     to come. 802.11ax and 6Ghz support are planned.

BUGS
     Certainly.
