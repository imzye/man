ROLO(1)                 FreeBSD General Commands Manual                ROLO(1)

NAME
     rolo – text-based contact management software

SYNOPSIS
     rolo [-r] [-f datafile]
     rolo [-v]
     rolo [-V]

DESCRIPTION
     Rolo keeps track of your contacts and display them to you with a text-
     based menu. Rolo strives to be a well-constructed tool for complimenting
     text-based email programs-such as mutt. It utilizes the vCard version 3.0
     format for storing its contacts and it interfaces with the end-user
     through a NCurses front-end.

     The options are as follows:

           -r  Open the data file in read-only mode. This essentially disables
               adding, editing, and deleting contacts.

           -f  Use the specified file as the data file.

           -v  Display the version.

           -V  Display the copyright and license.

ENVIRONMENT
     ROLO_EDITOR  If ROLO_EDITOR is set, its value is used as the name of the
                  program to invoke when displaying contact entries in
                  advanced edit. If ROLO_EDITOR is not set, then EDITOR is
                  used. If EDITOR is also not set, the default value of vi is
                  used.

FILES
     ~/.rolo/rolorc        Rolo configuration file.
     ~/.rolo/contacts.vcf  Default data file that rolo reads upon startup.

SEE ALSO
     vi(1)
