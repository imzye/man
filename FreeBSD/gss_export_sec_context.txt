GSS_EXPORT_SEC_CONTEXT(3)               FreeBSD Library Functions Manual (prm)

NAME
     gss_export_sec_context – Transfer a security context to another process

SYNOPSIS
     #include <gssapi/gssapi.h>

     OM_uint32
     gss_export_sec_context(OM_uint32 *minor_status,
         gss_ctx_id_t *context_handle, gss_buffer_t interprocess_token);

DESCRIPTION
     Provided to support the sharing of work between multiple processes.  This
     routine will typically be used by the context-acceptor, in an application
     where a single process receives incoming connection requests and accepts
     security contexts over them, then passes the established context to one
     or more other processes for message exchange.  gss_export_sec_context()
     deactivates the security context for the calling process and creates an
     interprocess token which, when passed to gss_import_sec_context() in
     another process, will re-activate the context in the second process.
     Only a single instantiation of a given context may be active at any one
     time; a subsequent attempt by a context exporter to access the exported
     security context will fail.

     The implementation may constrain the set of processes by which the
     interprocess token may be imported, either as a function of local
     security policy, or as a result of implementation decisions.  For
     example, some implementations may constrain contexts to be passed only
     between processes that run under the same account, or which are part of
     the same process group.

     The interprocess token may contain security-sensitive information (for
     example cryptographic keys).  While mechanisms are encouraged to either
     avoid placing such sensitive information within interprocess tokens, or
     to encrypt the token before returning it to the application, in a typical
     object-library GSS-API implementation this may not be possible.  Thus the
     application must take care to protect the interprocess token, and ensure
     that any process to which the token is transferred is trustworthy.

     If creation of the interprocess token is successful, the implementation
     shall deallocate all process-wide resources associated with the security
     context, and set the context_handle to GSS_C_NO_CONTEXT.  In the event of
     an error that makes it impossible to complete the export of the security
     context, the implementation must not return an interprocess token, and
     should strive to leave the security context referenced by the
     context_handle parameter untouched.  If this is impossible, it is
     permissible for the implementation to delete the security context,
     providing it also sets the context_handle parameter to GSS_C_NO_CONTEXT.

PARAMETERS
     minor_status            Mechanism specific status code.

     context_handle          Context handle identifying the context to
                             transfer.

     interprocess_token      Token to be transferred to target process.
                             Storage associated with this token must be freed
                             by the application after use with a call to
                             gss_release_buffer().

RETURN VALUES
     GSS_S_COMPLETE             Successful completion

     GSS_S_CONTEXT_EXPIRED      The context has expired

     GSS_S_NO_CONTEXT           The context was invalid

     GSS_S_UNAVAILABLE          The operation is not supported
