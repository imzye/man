NAME
       mkcomposecache - create a cache file for a compose file explicitly


SYNOPSIS
       mkcomposecache locale compose-file cache-dir [ internal-name ]


DESCRIPTION
       mkcomposecache creates a cache file for the specified compose-file used
       in the given locale and saves it in cache-dir.  If internal-name has
       been specified, it is used as the name of the compose table for
       computing the hash values and internal validation. This is necessary if
       global compose cache files shall be created while using DESTDIR during
       X11 installation.

       Notes:

       - compose cache files are created by libX11, thus an Xserver has to be
         running and DISPLAY has to be set correctly for creating cache files.

       - libX11 will not write compose cache files if run as root or with
         different real and effective uids.

       - libX11 will not create compose cache files in directories writable
         for other users.


DIAGNOSTICS
       mkcomposecache returns with exit status 1 on general errors (no
       Xserver, invoked as root, etc.) and 2 on unsupported locales.

       An exit status of 0 does not imply that a cache file is actually
       written, though.  This very much depends on the used libX11 and its
       safety regulations.
