VIMB(1)                           Vimb Manual                          VIMB(1)

NAME
       Vimb - Vim Browser - A modal web browser based on WebKit, inspired by
       Vim: the great editor.

SYNOPSIS
       vimb [OPTIONS] [URI|file|-]

DESCRIPTION
       Vimb is a WebKit based web browser that behaves like the Vimperator
       plugin for Firefox and has usage paradigms from the great editor, Vim.
       The goal of Vimb is to build a completely keyboard-driven, efficient
       and pleasurable browsing-experience.

OPTIONS
       If no URI or file is given, Vimb will open the configured home-page.
       If URI is '-', Vimb reads the HTML to display from stdin.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options
       too.

       -C, --cmd CMD
              Run CMD as ex command line right before the first page is
              loaded.  If the flag is used more than one time, the commands
              are called in order they are given.  You could also pass several
              ex commands in one CMD, if they are separated by "|".

              vimb --cmd "set dark-mode=on|set header=Referer,DNT=1"

       -c, --config FILE
              Use custom configuration given as FILE.  This will also be
              applied on new spawned instances.

       -e, --embed WINID
              WINID of an XEmbed-aware application, that Vimb will use as its
              parent.

       -i, --incognito
              Start an instance with user data read-only (see FILES section).

       -h, --help
              Show help options.

       -p, --profile PROFILE-NAME
              Create or open specified configuration profile.  Configuration
              data for the profile is stored in a directory named PROFILE-NAME
              under default directory for configuration data.

       -v, --version
              Print build and version information and then quit.

       --no-maximize
              Do no attempt to maximize window.

       --bug-info
              Prints information about used libraries for bug reports and then
              quit.

MODES
       Vimb is modal and has the following main modes:

       Normal Mode
              The default mode.  Pressing Escape always enter normal mode.

       Input Mode
              Used for editing text elements in a webpage.

       Command Mode
              Execute `ex` commands from the builtin inputbox (commandline).

       Pass-Through Mode
              In Pass-Through mode only the `<Esc>` and `<C-[>` keybindings
              are interpreted by Vimb, all other keystrokes are given to the
              webview to handle them.  This allows the use of a website's
              configured keybindings, that might otherwise be swallowed by
              Vimb.

NORMAL MODE COMMANDS
       Some of the Normal Model Commands can have a numeric count to multiply
       the effect of the command.  If a command supports the count this is
       shown as [N].

   General
       :      Start Command Mode and print `:' to the input box.

       gi     Set cursor to the first editable element in the page and switch
              to Input Mode.

       i      Set cursor to the last focused element in the page and switch to
              Input Mode.  If no element was focused before the first element
              is focused like with `gi'.

       CTRL-Z Switch Vimb into Pass-Through Mode.

       '{A-Z} Jump to the global mark {A-Z} on a (possibly) different page.

       ''     Jumps to the position before the latest jump, or where the last
              "m'" command was given.

   Hinting
       Hinting in Vimb is how you accomplish the tasks that you would do with
       the mouse in common mouse-driven browsers: open a URI, yank a URI, save
       a page and so on. When hinting is started, the relevant elements on the
       page will be marked by labels generated from configured `hint-keys'.
       Hints can be selected by using <Tab>, <C-I> or <C-Tab>, <C-O>, by
       typing the chars of the label, or filtering the elements by some text
       that is part of the hinted element (like URI, link text, button label)
       or any combination of these methods.  If <enter> is pressed, the
       current active hint will be fired.  If only one possible hint remains,
       this will be fired automatically.

       Syntax: ;{mode}{hint}

       Start Hints mode.  Different elements depending on mode are highlighted
       and `numbered'.  Elements can be selected either by typing their label,
       or by typing part of their text (hint) to narrow down the result.  When
       an element has been selected, it is automatically clicked or used
       (depending on mode) and hint mode ends.

       The filtering of hints by text splits the query at ' ' and use the
       single parts as separate queries to filter the hints.  This is useful
       for hints that have a lot of filterable chars in common and many chars
       are required to make a distinct selection.  For example ';over tw' will
       easily select the second hint out of {'very long link text one', 'very
       long link text two'}.

       The following keys have special meanings in Hints modes:
       <CR>   Selects the first highlighted element, or the current focused.
       <Tab>  Moves the focus to the next hint element.
       <S-Tab>
              Moves the focus to the previous hint element.
       <Esc>, CTRL-C, CTRL-[
              Exits Hints mode without selecting an element.

       Hint modes:
              f      Is an alias for the ;o hint mode.
              F      Is an alias for the ;t hint mode.
              ;o     Open hint's location in the current window.
              ;t     Open hint's location in a new window.
              ;s     Saves the hint's destination under the configured
                     `download-path'.
              ;O     Generate an `:open' prompt with hint's URI.
              ;T     Generate an `:tabopen' prompt with hint's URI.
              ;e     Open the configured editor (`editor-command') with the
                     hinted form element's content.  If the file in editor is
                     saved and the editor is closed, the file content will be
                     put back in the form field.
              ;i     Open hinted image in the current window.
              ;I     Open hinted image in a new window.
              ;k     Kill (remove) hinted element from the page.
              ;p     Push the hint's URI to the end of the Read It Later queue
                     like the `:qpush' command.  This is only available if
                     Vimb was compiled with the QUEUE feature.
              ;P     Push the hint's URI to the beginning of the Read It Later
                     queue like the `:qunshift' command.  This is only
                     available if Vimb was compiled with the QUEUE feature.
              ;x     Hints like ;o, but instead of opening the hinted URI, the
                     `x-hint-command' is run in Vimb.
              ["x];y Yank hint's destination location into primary and
                     secondary clipboard and into the register x.
              ["x];Y Yank hint's text description or form text into primary
                     and secondary clipboard and into the register x.

       Syntax: g;{mode}{hint}
              Start an extended hints mode and stay there until <Esc> is
              pressed.  Like normal hinting, except that after a hint is
              selected, hints remain visible so that another one can be
              selected with the same action as the first.  Note that the
              extended hint mode can only be combined with the following hint
              modes I o p P s t y Y.

       Motion
              Motions commands are like those for normal mode except that CTRL
              is used as modifier.  But they can not be used together with a
              count.

              CTRL-F Scroll one page down.
              CTRL-B Scroll one page up.
              CTRL-D Scroll half page down.
              CTRL-U Scroll half page up.
              CTRL-J Scroll one step down.
              CTRL-K Scroll one step up.

   Searching
       /QUERY, ?QUERY
              Start searching for QUERY in the current page.  / start search
              forward, ? in backward direction.

       *, #   Start searching for the current selected text, or if no text is
              selected for the content of the primary or secondary clipboard.
              * start the search in forward direction and # in backward
              direction.

              Note that these commands will yank the text selection into the
              clipboard and may remove other content from there!

       [N]n   Search for Nnth next search result depending on current search
              direction.

       [N]N   Search for Nnth previous search result depending on current
              search

       <CR>   Perform a click on element containing the current highlighted
              search result.  direction.

   Zooming
       [N]zi  Zoom-In the text of the page by N steps.

       [N]zo  Zoom-Out the text of the page by N steps.

       [N]zI  Full-Content Zoom-In the page by N steps.

       [N]zO  Full-Content Zoom-Out the page by N steps.

       zz     Reset Zoom.

   Yank
       ["x]y  Yank the URI or current page into register x and clipboard.

       ["x]Y  Yank the current selection into register x and clipboard.

COMMAND MODE
       Commands that are listed below are ex-commands like in Vim, that are
       typed into the inputbox (the command line of vimb).  The commands may
       vary in their syntax or in the parts they allow, but in general they
       follow a simple syntax.

       Syntax: :[:| ][N]cmd[name][!][ lhs][ rhs]

       Where lhs (left hand side) must not contain any unescaped space.  The
       syntax of the rhs (right hand side) if this is available depends on the
       command.  At the moment the count parts [N] of commands is parsed, but
       currently there is no command that uses the count.

       Commands that are typed interactivly are normally recorded into command
       history and register.  To avoid this, the commands can be prefixed by
       one or more additional `:' or whitespace.

       Multiple commands, separated by a `|' can be given in a single command
       line and will be executed consecutively.  The pipe can be included as
       an argument to a command by escaping it with a backslash.
       Following commands process the entire command-line string literally.
       These commands will include any `|' as part of their argument string
       and so can not be followed by another command.

       - autocmd
       - cmap, cnoremap, imap, inoremap, nmap, nnoremap
       - eval
       - normal
       - open, tabopen
       - shellcmd

   Command Line Editing
       <Esc>, CTRL-[, CTRL-C
              Ignore all typed content and switch back to normal mode.

       <CR>   Submit the entered `ex` command or search query to run it.

       CTRL-H Deletes the char before the cursor.

       CTRL-W Deletes the last word before the cursor.

       CTRL-U Remove everything between cursor and prompt.

       CTRL-B Moves the cursor directly behind the prompt `:'.

       CTRL-E Moves the cursor after the prompt in inputbox.

       CTRL-V Pass the next key press directly to GTK.

       CTRL-R {a-z"%:/;}
              Insert the content of given register at cursor position.  See
              also section about `:reg[ister]' command.

   Command Line History
       <Tab>  Start completion of the content in the inputbox in forward
              direction.

       <S-Tab>
              Start completion of the content in the inputbox in backward
              direction.

       <Up>   Step backward in the command history.

       <Down> Step forward in the command history.  Yank the current selection
              into register x and clipboard.

   Open
       :o[pen] [URI]
              Open the give URI in the current window.  If URI is empty, the
              configured 'home-page' is opened.

       :t[abopen] [URI]
              Open the give URI in a new window.  If URI is empty, the
              configured 'home-page' is opened.

   Key Mapping
       Key mappings allow users to alter the actions of key presses.  Each key
       mapping is associated with a mode and only has effect when the mode is
       active.  The following commands allow the user to substitute one
       sequence of key presses by another.

       Syntax: :{m}map {lhs} {rhs}

       Note that the lhs ends with the first found space.  If you want to use
       space also in the {lhs} you have to escape this with a single `\', as
       shown in the examples.

       The rhs starts with the first non-space char. If you want a rhs that
       starts with a space, you have to use "<Space>".

       Standard key mapping commands are provided for these modes m:
       n      Normal mode: when browsing normally.
       i      Insert mode: when interacting with text fields on a website.
       c      Command Line mode: when typing into Vimb's command line.

       Most keys in key sequences are represented simply by the character that
       you see on the screen when you type them.  However, as a number of
       these characters have special meanings, and a number of keys have no
       visual representation, a special notation is required.

       As special key names have the format <...>.  The following special keys
       can be used: <Left>, <Up>, <Right>, <Down> for the cursor keys, <Tab>,
       <Esc>, <CR>, <Space>, <BS>, <F1>-<F12> and <C-A>-<C-Z>.

       :nm[ap] {lhs} {rhs}
       :im[ap] {lhs} {rhs}
       :cm[ap] {lhs} {rhs}
              Map the key sequence lhs to rhs for the modes where the map
              command applies.  The result, including rhs, is then further
              scanned for mappings.  This allows for nested and recursive use
              of mappings.

              :cmap <C-G>h /home/user/downloads/
                     Adds a keybind to insert a file path into the input box.
                     This could be useful for the `:save' command that could
                     be used as ":save ^Gh".
              :nmap <F1> :set scripts=on<CR>:open !glib<Tab><CR>
                     This will enable scripts and lookup the first bookmarked
                     URI with the tag `glib' and open it immediately if F1 key
                     is pressed.
              :nmap \ \  50G
                     Example which maps two spaces to go to 50% of the page.
       :nn[oremap] {lhs} {rhs}
       :ino[remap] {lhs} {rhs}
       :cno[remap] {lhs} {rhs}
              Map the key sequence lhs to rhs for the mode where the map
              command applies.  Disallow mapping of rhs, to avoid nested and
              recursive mappings.  Often used to redefine a command.
       :nu[nmap] {lhs}
       :iu[nmap] {lhs}
       :cu[nmap] {lhs}
              Remove the mapping of lhs for the applicable mode.

   Bookmarks
       :bma [tags]
              Save the current opened URI with tags to the bookmark file.

       :bmr [URI]
              Removes all bookmarks for given URI or, if not given, the
              current opened page.

   Handlers
       Handlers allow specifying external scripts to handle alternative URI
       methods.

       :handler-add handler=cmd
              Adds a handler to direct handler links to the external cmd.  The
              cmd can contain one placeholder `%s` that will be filled by the
              full URI given when the command is called.

              :handler-add mailto=urxvt -e mutt %s
                     to start email client for mailto links.
              :handler-add magnet=xdg-open %s
                     to open magnet links with xdg-open.
              :handler-add ftp=urxvt -e wget %s -P ~/ftp-downloads
                     to handle ftp downloads via wget.

       :handler-remove handler
              Remove the handler for the given URI handler.

   Shortcuts
       Shortcuts allow the opening of an URI built up from a named template
       with additional parameters.  If a shortcut named 'dd' is defined, you
       can use it with `:open dd list of parameters' to open the generated
       URI.

       Shortcuts are convenient to use with search engines where the URI is
       standardised and a single parameter is user defined.

       :shortcut-add shortcut=URI
              Adds a shortcut with the shortcut and URI template.  The URI can
              contain multiple placeholders $0-$9 that will be filled by the
              parameters given when the shortcut is called.  The parameters
              given when the shortcut is called will be split into as many
              parameters like the highest used placeholder.

              To use spaces within the parameters, the parameters can be
              grouped by surrounding them with single-or double quotes-as
              shown in example shortcut `map'.

              :shortcut-add dl=https://duckduckgo.com/lite/?q=$0
                     to setup a search engine.  Can be called by `:open dl my
                     search phrase'.
              :shortcut-add gh=https://github.com/$0/$1
                     to build URIs from given parameters.  Can be called
                     `:open gh fanglingsu vimb'.
              :shortcut-add map=https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=$0&daddr=$1
                     to search for a route, all but the last parameter must be
                     quoted if they contain spaces like `:open map "city hall,
                     London" railway station, London'

       :shortcut-remove shortcut
              Remove the search engine to the given shortcut.

       :shortcut-default shortcut
              Set the shortcut for given shortcut as the default, that is the
              shortcut to be used if no shortcut is given and the string to
              open is not an URI. It doesn't matter if the shortcut is already
              in use or not to be able to set it.

   Settings
       :se[t] var=value
              Set configuration values named by var.  To set boolean variable
              you should use 'on', 'off' or 'true' and 'false'.  Colors are
              given as hexadecimal value like '#f57700'. Spaces or more equals
              signs in value just work without quotes: for example, ":set
              sans-serif-font=Some Sans Font".

       :se[t] var+=value
              Add the value to a number option, or append the value to a
              string option.  When the option is a comma separated list, a
              comma is added, unless the value was empty.

       :se[t] var^=value
              Multiply the value to a number option, or prepend the value to a
              string option.  When the option is a comma separated list, a
              comma is added, unless the value was empty.

       :se[t] var-=value
              Subtract the value from a number option, or remove the value
              from a string option, if it is there.  When the option is a
              comma separated list, a comma is deleted, unless the option
              becomes empty.

       :se[t] var?
              Show the current set value of variable.  VAR.

       :se[t] var!
              Toggle the value of boolean variable var and display the new set
              value.

   Queue
       The queue allows the marking of URIs for later reading.  This list is
       shared between the single instances of Vimb.

       :qpu[sh] [URI]
              Push URI or, if not given, the current URI to the end of the
              queue.

       :qun[shift] [URI]
              Push URI or, if not given, the current URI to the beginning of
              the queue.

       :qp[op]
              Open the oldest queue entry in the current browser window and
              remove it from the queue.

       :qc[lear]
              Removes all entries from queue.

   Automatic commands
       An autocommand is a command that is executed automatically in response
       to some event, such as a URI being opened.  Autocommands are very
       powerful.  Use them with care and they will help you avoid typing many
       commands.

       Autocommands are built with following properties.

       group  When the [group] argument is not given, Vimb uses the current
              group as defined with ':augroup', otherwise, Vimb uses the group
              defined with [group].  Groups are useful to remove multiple
              grouped autocommands.

       event  You can specify a comma separated list of event names.  No white
              space can be used in this list.

              Events:
              LoadStarting
                     Fired before a new page is going to be opened.  No data
                     has been sent or received yet, the load may still fail
                     for transport issues.
              LoadStarted
                     Fired if a new page is going to be opened.  No data has
                     been received yet, the load may still fail for transport
                     issues.
              LoadCommitted
                     Fired if first data chunk has arrived, meaning that the
                     necessary transport requirements are established, and the
                     load is being performed.  This is the right event to
                     toggle content related setting like 'scripts', 'plugins'
                     and such things.
              LoadFinished
                     Fires when everything that was required to display on the
                     page has been loaded.
              DownloadStarted
                     Fired right after a download is started.
              DownloadFinished
                     Fired if a Vimb managed download is finished.
              DownloadFailed
                     Fired if a Vimb managed download failed.

       pat    Comma separated list of patterns, matches in order to check if a
              autocommand applies to the URI associated to an event.  To use
              ',' within the single patterns this must be escaped as '\,'.

              Patterns:
              *      Matches any sequence of characters.  This includes also
                     '/' in contrast to shell patterns.
              ?      Matches any single character except of '/'.
              {one,two}
                     Matches 'one' or 'two'.  Any '{', ',' and '}' within this
                     pattern must be escaped by a '\'.  '*' and '?' have no
                     special meaning within the curly braces.
              \      Use backslash to escape the special meaning of '?*{},' in
                     the pattern or pattern list.

       cmd    Any `ex` command vimb understands.  The leading ':' is not
              required.  Multiple commands can be separated by '|'.

       :au[tocmd] [group] {event} {pat} {cmd}
              Add cmd to the list of commands that Vimb will execute
              automatically on event for a URI matching pat autocmd-patterns.
              Vimb always adds the cmd after existing autocommands, so that
              the autocommands are executed in the order in which they were
              given.

       :au[tocmd]! [group] {event} {pat} {cmd}
              Remove all autocommands associated with event and which pattern
              match pat, and add the command cmd.  Note that the pattern is
              not matches literally to find autocommands to remove, like Vim
              does.  Vimb matches the autocommand pattern with pat.  If
              [group] is not given, deletes autocommands in current group, as
              noted above.

       :au[tocmd]! [group] {event} {pat}
              Remove all autocommands associated with event and which pattern
              matches pat in given group (current group by default).

       :au[tocmd]! [group] * {pat}
              Remove all autocommands with patterns matching pat for all
              events in given group (current group by default).

       :au[tocmd]! [group] {event}
              Remove all autocommands for event in given group (current group
              by default).

       :au[tocmd]! [group]
              Remove all autocommands in given group (current group by
              default).

       :aug[roup] {name}
              Define the autocmd group name for the following ":autocmd"
              commands.  The name "end" selects the default group.

       :aug[roup]! {name}
              Delete the autocmd group name.

       Example:
       :aug github
       :  au LoadCommitted * set scripts=off|set cookie-accept=never
       :  au LoadCommitted http{s,}://github.com/* set scripts=on
       :aug end

   Misc
       :cl[eardata] [dataTypes] [timespan]
              Asynchronously clears the website data of the given list of
              dataTypes modified in the past timespan.  Note that the
              dataTypes must not contain spaces.  If timespan is not given,
              all website data will be removed.  Note that this effects all
              running instances of vimb.

              The dataTypes is a comma separated list of following types.
              memory-cache
                     Memory cache.
              disk-cache

                     Plugin data.
              cookies
                     Cookies. Note that the cookies are not cleared in case a
                     timespan is given.
              hsts-cache
                     HTTP Strict Transport Security cache.
              -      Can be used to clear all known data types in case a
                     timespan is used.

              The timespan is given as sequence of '[multiplier]unit' tupels
              with following units.
              y      year (365 days)
              w      week (7 days)
              d      day
              h      hour
              m      minute
              s      second

              Example:
              :cleardata
                     to clear all known website data types without any
                     timespan restriction.
              :cleardata - 5m
                     to clear all known website data types modified in the
                     last 5 minutes.
              :cleardata local-storage,session-storage,cookies
                     to completely clear the cookies, local- and session-
                     storage without time restrictions.
              :cleardata disk-cache 2d4h
                     to clear the disk cache that was modified in the past two
                     days and four hours.

       :sh[ellcmd]! cmd
              Like :sh[ellcmd] but asynchronous.

              Example:
              :sh! /bin/sh -c 'echo "`date` $VIMB_URI" >> myhistory.txt'

       :sh[ellcmd] cmd
              Runs the given shell cmd syncron and print the output into
              inputbox.  The following patterns in cmd are expanded:
              '~username', '~/', '$VAR' and '${VAR}'.  A '\' before these
              patterns disables the expansion.


              The following environment variables are set for called shell
              commands.
              VIMB_URI
                     This variable is set by Vimb everytime a new page is
                     opened to the URI of the page.
              VIMB_SELECTION
                     This variable is set to the current selected text on the
                     page.
              VIMB_TITLE
                     Contains the title of the current opened page.
              VIMB_PID
                     Contains the pid of the running Vimb instance.
              VIMB_WIN_ID
                     Holds the X-Window id of the Vimb window.
              VIMB_XID
                     Holds the X-Window id of the Vimb window or of the
                     embedding window if Vimb is compiled with XEMBED and
                     started with the -e option.
       :sh[ellcmd]! cmd
              Like :sh[ellcmd] but asynchronous.

              Example:
              :sh! /bin/sh -c 'echo "`date` $VIMB_URI" >> myhistory.txt'
       :s[ave] [path]
              Download current opened page into configured download directory.
              If path is given, download under this file name or path.  path
              is expanded and can therefore contain '~/', '${ENV}' and '~user'
              pattern.
       :so[urce] [file]
              Read ex commands from file.
       :q[uit]
              Close the browser.  This will be refused if there are running
              downloads.
       :q[uit]!
              Close the browser independent from an running download.
       :reg[ister]
              Display the contents of all registers.
              Registers:
              "a — "z
                     26 named registers "a to "z.  Vimb fills these registers
                     only when you say so.
              ":     Last executed `ex` command.
              ""     Last yanked content.
              "%     Curent opened URI.
              "/     Last search phrase.
              ";     Contains the last hinted URL.

       :e[val] javascript
              Runs the given javascript in the current page and display the
              evaluated value.

              Example: :eval document.cookie

       :e[val]! javascript
              Like :eval, but there is nothing print to the input box.

       :no[rmal] [cmds]
              Execute normal mode commands cmds.  This makes it possible to
              execute normal mode commands typed on the input box.

              cmds cannot start with a space.  Put a count of 1 (one) before
              it, "1 " is one space.

              Example: :set scripts!|no! R

       :no[rmal]! [cmds]
              Like :normal, but no mapping is applied to cmds.

       :ha[rdcopy]
              Print current document.  Open a GUI dialog where you can select
              the printer, number of copies, orientation, etc.

INPUT MODE
       <Esc>, CTRL-[
              Switch back to normal mode.

       CTRL-O Executes the next command as normal mode command and return to
              input mode.

       CTRL-T Open configured editor with content of current form field.

       CTRL-V Pass the next key press directly to WebKit.

       CTRL-Z Enter the pass-through mode.

COMPLETIONS
       The completions are triggered by pressing `<Tab>` or `<S-Tab>` in the
       activated inputbox.  Depending of the current inserted content
       different completions are started.  The completion takes additional
       typed chars to filter the completion list that is shown.

       commands
              The completion for commands are started when at least `:` is
              shown in the inputbox.  If initial chars are passed, the
              completion will lookup those commands that begin with the given
              chars.

       settings
              The setting name completion is started if at least `:set ` is
              shown in inputbox and does also match settings that begins with
              already typed setting prefix.

       history
              The history of URIs is shown for the `:open ` and `:tabopen `
              commands.  This completion looks up every given word in the
              history URI and titles.  Only those history items are shown,
              where the title or URI contains all tags.

              :open foo bar<Tab>
                     will complete only URIs that contain the words foo and
                     bar.

       bookmarks
              The bookmark completion is similar to the history completion,
              but does match only the tags of the bookmarks.  The bookmark
              completion is started by `:open !`, `:tabopen !` or `:bmr ` and
              does a prefix search for all given words in the bookmark tags.

              :open !foo ba
                     will match all bookmarks that have tags starting with
                     "foo" and "ba".  If the bookmark does not have any tags
                     set, the URL is split on `.' and `/' into tags.

              :bmr tag
                     will match all bookmarks that have tags starting with
                     "tag".

       bookmark tags
              The bookmark tag completion allows the insertion of already used
              bookmarks for the `:bma ` commands.

       search The search completion allows a filtered list of already done
              searches.  This completion starts by `/` or `?` in inputbox and
              performs a prefix comparison for further typed chars.

SETTINGS
       All settings listed below can be set with the `:set' command.  See
       Settings under COMMAND MODE for syntax.

       accelerated-2d-canvas(bool)
              Enable or disable accelerated 2D canvas.  When accelerated 2D
              canvas is enabled, WebKit may render some 2D canvas content
              using hardware accelerated drawing operations.

       allow-file-access-from-file-urls(bool)
              Indicates whether file access is allowed from file URLs.  By
              default, when something is loaded using a file URI, cross origin
              requests to other file resources are not allowed.

       allow-universal-access-from-file-urls(bool)
              Indicates whether or not JavaScript running in the context of a
              file scheme URL should be allowed to access content from any
              origin.  By default, when something is loaded in a using a file
              scheme URL, access to the local file system and arbitrary local
              storage is not allowed.

       caret(bool)
              Whether to enable accessibility enhanced keyboard navigation.

       cookie-accept (string)
              Cookie accept policy {`always', `never', `origin' (accept all
              non-third-party cookies)}.

       closed-max-items (int)

              A command with placeholder '%s' that will be invoked to download
              a URI in case 'download-use-external' is enabled.

              The following additional environment variable are available:
              $VIMB_URI
                     The URI of the current opened page, normally the page
                     where the download was started from, also known as
                     referer.
              $VIMB_DOWNLOAD_PATH
                     Setting value of 'download-path' which would be used
                     normally for downloads.

              :set download-command=/bin/sh -c "cd '$VIMB_DOWNLOAD_PATH' &&
              curl -sLJOC - -e '$VIMB_URI' %s"

       download-path (string)
              Path to the default download directory.  If no download
              directory is set, download will be written into current
              directory.  The following pattern will be expanded if the
              download is started '~/', '~user', '$VAR' and '${VAR}'.

       download-use-external (bool)
              Indicates if the external download tool set as 'download-
              command' should be used to handle downloads.  If this is
              disabled Vimb will handle the download.

       editor-command (string)
              Command with placeholder '%s' called if form field is opened
              with $EDITOR to spawn the editor-like `x-terminal-emulator -e
              vim %s'.  To use Gvim as the editor, it's necessary to call it
              with `-f' to run it in the foreground.

       font-size (int)
              The default font size used to display text.

       frame-flattening (bool)
              Whether to enable the Frame Flattening.  With this setting each
              subframe is expanded to its contents, which will flatten all the
              frames to become one scrollable page.

       fullscreen (bool)
              Show the current window full-screen.

       hardware-acceleration-policy (string)
              This setting decides how to enable and disable hardware
              acceleration.
              ondemand
                     enables the hardware acceleration when the web contents
                     request it, disabling it again when no longer needed.
              always enforce hardware acceleration to be enabled.
              never  disables it completely.  Note that disabling hardware
                     acceleration might cause some websites to not render
                     correctly or consume more CPU.

       header (list)
              Comma separated list of headers that replaces default header
              sent by WebKit or new headers.  The format for the header list
              elements is `name[=[value]]'.

              Note that these headers will replace already existing headers.
              If there is no '=' after the header name, then the complete
              header will be removed from the request, if the '=' is present
              means that the header value is set to empty value.

              Note that webkit reused already set headers in case of a reload
              of a page.  So if there are headers removed that where
              previously use to access a certain page and the page is reloaded
              or opened via back/forward history the header will still be
              sent.  To apply the new header setting properly it's required to
              request another page or to open current page new by `O<Cr>`.

              To use '=' within a header value the value must be quoted like
              shown in Example for the Cookie header.

              :set header=DNT=1,User-Agent,Cookie='name=value'
                     Send the 'Do Not Track' header with each request and
                     remove the User-Agent Header completely from request.

       hint-follow-last (bool)
              If on, vimb automatically follows the last remaining hint on the
              page.  If off hints are fired only if enter is pressed.

       hint-keys-same-length (bool)
              If on, all hint labels will have the same length, so no hints
              will be ambiguous.

       hint-timeout (int)
              Timeout before automatically following a non-unique numerical
              hint.  To disable auto fire of hints, set this value to 0.

       hint-keys (string)
              The keys used to label and select hints.  With its default
              value, each hint has a unique label which can be typed to select
              it, while all other characters are used to filter hints based on
              their text.  With a value such as asdfg;lkjh, each hint is
              `labeled' based on the characters of the home row.

              If the hint-keys string starts with a '0' the keys are
              considered to follow the rules of numeric labeling. So that the
              ifrst char of the label will never start with the '0'.

              Note that the hint matching by label built of hint-keys is case
              sensitive.  In this vimb differs from some other browsers that
              show hint labels in upper case, but match them lowercase.

              To have upper case hint labels, it's possible to add following
              css to the `style.css' file in vimb's configuration directory.

              "span[vimbhint="label"] {text-transform: uppercase !important;}"

       hint-match-element (bool)
              If this is set to 'true' typed chars that are not part of the
              set 'hint-keys' are used to filter hinted DOM elements by their
              text value.  If 'hint-keys' are set to chars instead of numbers
              it might be useful to disable matching of the elements by 'hint-
              match-element=false'.

       history-max-items (int)
              Maximum number of unique items stored in search-, command or URI
              history.  If history-max-items is set to 0, the history file
              will not be changed.  This setting has no effect if option
              --incognito is set.

       home-page (string)
              Homepage that vimb opens if started without a URI.

              Whether media playback is full-screen only or inline playback is
              allowed.  Setting it to false allows specifying that media
              playback should be always fullscreen.

       media-playback-requires-user-gesture (bool)
              Whether a user gesture (such as clicking the play button) would
              be required to start media playback or load media.  Setting it
              on requires a gesture by the user to start playback, or to load
              the media.

              page, such as hyperlinks and form controls, by using Left,
              Right, Up and Down arrow keys.  For example, if a user presses
              the Right key, heuristics determine whether there is an element

              If true, pressing the Tab key will focus the next element in the
              web view.  Otherwise, the web view will interpret Tab key
              presses as normal key presses.  If the selected element is
              editable, the Tab key will cause the insertion of a Tab
              character.

       timeoutlen (int)
              The time in milliseconds that is waited for a key code or mapped
              key sequence to complete.

              vimb command string.  Note that the command is run through the
              mapping mechanism of vimb so it might change the behaviour by
              adding or changing mappings.

              :set x-hint-command=:sh! curl -e <C-R>% <C-R>;
                     This fills the inputbox with the prefilled download
                     command and replaces `<C-R>%' with the current URI and
                     `<C-R>;' with the URI of the hinted element.

       xss-auditor (bool)
