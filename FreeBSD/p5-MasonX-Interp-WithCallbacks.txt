MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks(3)           User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks - Mason callback support via
       Params::CallbackRequest.

SYNOPSIS
       In your Mason component:

         % if (exists $ARGS{answer}) {
         <p><b>Answer: <% $ARGS{answer} %></b></p>
         % } else {
         <form>
           <p>Enter an epoch time: <input type="text" name="epoch_time" /><br />
             <input type="submit" name="myCallbacker|calc_time_cb" value="Calculate" />
           </p>
         </form>
         % }

       In handler.pl:

         use strict;
         use MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks;

         sub calc_time {
             my $cb = shift;
             my $params = $cb->params;
             my $val = $cb->value;
             $params->{answer} = localtime($val || time);
         }

         my $ah = HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler->new
           ( interp_class => 'MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks',
             callbacks => [ { cb_key  => 'calc_time',
                              pkg_key => 'myCallbacker',
                              cb      => \&calc_time } ]
           );

         sub handler {
             my $r = shift;
             $ah->handle_request($r);
         }

       Or, in a subclass of Params::Callback:

         package MyApp::CallbackHandler;
         use base qw(Params::Callback);
         __PACKAGE__->register_subclass( class_key => 'myCallbacker' );

         sub calc_time : Callback {
             my $self = shift;
             my $params = $self->params;
             my $val = $cb->value;
             $params->{answer} = localtime($val || time);
         }

       And then, in handler.pl:

         # Load order is important here!
         use MyApp::CallbackHandler;
         use MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks;

         my $ah = HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler->new
           ( interp_class => 'MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks',
             cb_classes => [qw(myCallbacker)] );

         sub handler {
             my $r = shift;
             $ah->handle_request($r);
         }

       Or, just use MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks directly:

         use MyApp::CallbackHandler;
         use MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks;
         my $interp = MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks->new
           ( cb_classes => [qw(myCallbacker)] );
         $interp->exec($comp, %args);

DESCRIPTION
       MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks subclasses HTML::Mason::Interp in order
       to provide a Mason callback system built on Params::CallbackRequest.
       Callbacks may be either code references provided to the new()
       constructor, or methods defined in subclasses of Params::Callback.
       Callbacks are triggered either for every request or by specially named
       keys in the Mason request arguments, and all callbacks are executed at
       the beginning of a request, just before Mason creates and executes the
       request component stack.

       This module brings support for a sort of plugin architecture based on
       Params::CallbackRequest to Mason. Mason then executes code before
       executing any components. This approach allows you to carry out logical
       processing of data submitted from a form, to affect the contents of the
       Mason request arguments (and thus the %ARGS hash in components), and
       even to redirect or abort the request before Mason handles it.

       Much of the documentation here is based on that in
       Params::CallbackRequest, although it prefers using HTML form fields for
       its examples rather than Perl hashes. But see the
       Params::CallbackRequest documentation for the latest on its interface.

JUSTIFICATION
       Why would you want to do this? Well, there are a number of reasons.
       Some I can think of offhand include:

       Stricter separation of logic from presentation
           Most application logic handled in Mason components takes place in
           "<%init>" blocks, often in the same component as presentation
           logic. By moving the application logic into Perl modules and then
           directing Mason to execute that code as callbacks, you obviously
           benefit from a cleaner separation of application logic and
           presentation.

       Widgitization
           Thanks to their ability to preprocess arguments, callbacks enable
           developers to develop easier-to-use, more dynamic widgets that can
           then be used in any and all Mason component, or even with other
           templating systems. For example, a widget that puts many related
           fields into a form (such as a date selection widget) can have its
           fields preprocessed by a callback (for example, to properly combine
           the fields into a unified date field) before the Mason component
           that responds to the form submission gets the data. See
           Params::Callback for an example solution for this very problem.

       Shared Memory
           Callbacks are just Perl subroutines in modules, and are therefore
           loaded at server startup time in a mod_perl environment. Thus the
           memory they consume is all in the Apache parent process, and shared
           by the child processes. For code that executes frequently, this can
           be much less resource-intensive than code in Mason components,
           since components are loaded separately in each Apache child process
           (unless they're preloaded via the "preloads" parameter to the
           HTML::Mason::Interp constructor).

       Performance
           Since they're executed before Mason creates a component stack and
           executes the components, callbacks have the opportunity to short-
           circuit the Mason processing by doing something else. A good
           example is redirection. Often the application logic in callbacks
           does its thing and then redirects the user to a different page.
           Executing the redirection in a callback eliminates a lot of
           extraneous processing that would otherwise be executed before the
           redirection, creating a snappier response for the user.

       Testing
           Mason components are not easy to test via a testing framework such
           as Test::Harness. Subroutines in modules, on the other hand, are
           fully testable. This means that you can write tests in your
           application test suite to test your callback subroutines.

       And if those aren't enough reasons, then just consider this: Callbacks
       are just way cool.

USAGE
       MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks uses Params::CallbackRequest for its
       callback architecture, and therefore supports its two different types
       of callbacks: those triggered by a specially named key in the Mason
       request arguments hash, and those executed for every request.

   Argument-Triggered Callbacks
       Argument-triggered callbacks are triggered by specially named request
       argument keys. These keys are constructed as follows: The package name
       followed by a pipe character ("|"), the callback key with the string
       "_cb" appended to it, and finally an optional priority number at the
       end. For example, if you specified a callback with the callback key
       "save" and the package key "world", a callback field might be added to
       an HTML form like this:

         <input type="button" value="Save World" name="world|save_cb" />

       This field, when submitted to the Mason server, would trigger the
       callback associated with the "save" callback key in the "world"
       package. If such a callback hasn't been configured, then
       Params::CallbackRequest will throw a
       Params::CallbackReuest::Exception::InvalidKey exception. Here's how to
       configure a functional callback when constructing your
       MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks object so that that doesn't happen:

         my $interp = MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks->new
           ( callbacks => [ { pkg_key => 'world',
                              cb_key  => 'save',
                              cb      => \&My::World::save } ] );

       With this configuration, the request argument created by the above HTML
       form field will trigger the execution of the &My::World::save
       subroutine.

       Functional Callback Subroutines

       Functional callbacks use a code reference for argument-triggered
       callbacks, and Params::CallbackRequest executes them with a single
       argument, a Params::Callback object. Thus, a callback subroutine will
       generally look something like this:

         sub foo {
             my $cb = shift;
             # Do stuff.
         }

       The Params::Callback object provides accessors to data relevant to the
       callback, including the callback key, the package key, and the request
       arguments (or parameters). It also includes redirect() and abort()
       methods. See the Params::Callback documentation for all the goodies.

       Note that all callbacks are executed in a "eval {}" block, so if any of
       your callback subroutines "die", Params::CallbackRequest will throw an
       Params::CallbackRequest::Exception::Execution exception If you don't
       like this, use the "cb_exception_handler" parameter to new() to install
       your own exception handler.

       Object-Oriented Callback Methods

       Object-oriented callback methods are defined in subclasses of
       Params::Callback. Unlike functional callbacks, they are not called with
       a Params::Callback object, but with an instance of the callback
       subclass. These classes inherit all the goodies provided by
       Params::Callback, so you can essentially use their instances exactly as
       you would use the Params::Callback object in functional callback
       subroutines. But because they're subclasses, you can add your own
       methods and attributes. See Params::Callback for all the gory details
       on subclassing, along with a few examples. Generally, callback methods
       will look like this:

         sub foo : Callback {
             my $self = shift;
             # Do stuff.
         }

       As with functional callback subroutines, method callbacks are executed
       in a "eval {}" block. Again, see the "cb_exception_handler" parameter
       to install your own exception handler.

       Note: It's important that you "use" any and all MasonX::Callback
       subclasses before you "use MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks" or "use
       Params::CallbackRequest". This is to get around an issue with
       identifying the names of the callback methods in mod_perl. Read the
       comments in the MasonX::Callback source code if you're interested in
       learning more.

       The Package Key

       The use of the package key is a convenience so that a system with many
       functional callbacks can use callbacks with the same keys but in
       different packages. The idea is that the package key will uniquely
       identify the module in which each callback subroutine is found, but it
       doesn't necessarily have to be so. Use the package key any way you
       wish, or not at all:

         my $interp = MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks->new
           ( callbacks => [ { cb_key  => 'save',
                              cb      => \&My::World::save } ] );

       But note that if you don't use the package key at all, you'll still
       need to provide one in the parameters to be submitted to exec() By
       default, that key is "DEFAULT". Such a callback field in an HTML form
       would then look like this:

         <input type="button" value="Save World" name="DEFAULT|save_cb" />

       If you don't like the "DEFAULT" package name, you can set an
       alternative default using the "default_pkg_name" parameter to new():

         my $interp = MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks->new
           ( callbacks        => [ { cb_key  => 'save',
                                     cb      => \&My::World::save } ],
             default_pkg_name => 'MyPkg' );

       Then, of course, any callbacks without a specified package key of their
       own will then use the custom default:

         <input type="button" value="Save World" name="MyPkg|save_cb" />

       The Class Key

       The class key is essentially a synonym for the package key, but applies
       more directly to object-oriented callbacks. The difference is mainly
       that it corresponds to an actual class, and that all Params::Callback
       subclasses are required to have a class key; it's not optional as it is
       with functional callbacks. The class key may be declared in your
       Params::Callback subclass like so:

         package MyApp::CallbackHandler;
         use base qw(Params::Callback);
         __PACKAGE__->register_subclass( class_key => 'MyCBHandler' );

       The class key can also be declared by implementing a CLASS_KEY()
       method, like so:

         package MyApp::CallbackHandler;
         use base qw(Params::Callback);
         __PACKAGE__->register_subclass;
         use constant CLASS_KEY => 'MyCBHandler';

       If no class key is explicitly defined, Params::Callback will use the
       subclass name, instead. In any event, the register_callback() method
       must be called to register the subclass with Params::Callback. See the
       Params::Callback documentation for complete details.

       Priority

       Sometimes one callback is more important than another. For example, you
       might rely on the execution of one callback to set up variables needed
       by another.  Since you can't rely on the order in which callbacks are
       executed (the Mason request arguments are stored in a hash, and the
       processing of a hash is, of course, unordered), you need a method of
       ensuring that the setup callback executes first.

       In such a case, you can set a higher priority level for the setup
       callback than for callbacks that depend on it. For functional
       callbacks, you can do it like this:

         my $interp = MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks->new
           ( callbacks        => [ { cb_key   => 'setup',
                                     priority => 3,
                                     cb       => \&setup },
                                   { cb_key   => 'save',
                                     cb       => \&save }
                                 ] );

       For object-oriented callbacks, you can define the priority right in the
       callback method declaration:

         sub setup : Callback( priority => 3 ) {
             my $self = shift;
             # ...
         }

         sub save : Callback {
             my $self = shift;
             # ...
         }

       In these examples, the "setup" callback has been configured with a
       priority level of "3". This ensures that it will always execute before
       the "save" callback, which has the default priority of "5". This is
       true regardless of the order of the fields in the corresponding
       HTML::Form:

         <input type="button" value="Save World" name="DEFAULT|save_cb" />
         <input type="hidden" name="DEFAULT|setup_cb" value="1" />

       Despite the fact that the "setup" callback field appears after the
       "save" field (and will generally be submitted by the browser in that
       order), the "setup" callback will always execute first because of its
       higher priority.

       Although the "save" callback got the default priority of "5", this too
       can be customized to a different priority level via the
       "default_priority" parameter to new() for functional callbacks and the
       "default_priority" to the class declaration for object-oriented
       callbacks For example, this functional callback configuration:

         my $interp = MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks->new
           ( callbacks        => [ { cb_key   => 'setup',
                                     priority => 3,
                                     cb       => \&setup },
                                   { cb_key   => 'save',
                                     cb       => \&save }
                                 ],
             default_priority => 2 );

       And this Params::Callback subclass declaration:

         package MyApp::CallbackHandler;
         use base qw(Params::Callback);
         __PACKAGE__->register_subclass( class_key => 'MyCBHandler',
                                         default_priority => 2 );

       Will cause the "save" callback to always execute before the "setup"
       callback, since its priority level will default to "2".

       In addition, the priority level can be overridden via the form
       submission field itself by appending a priority level to the end of the
       callback field name. Hence, this example:

         <input type="button" value="Save World" name="DEFAULT|save_cb2" />
         <input type="hidden" name="DEFAULT|setup_cb" value="1" />

       Causes the "save" callback to execute before the "setup" callback by
       overriding the "save" callback's priority to level "2". Of course, any
       other form field that triggers the "save" callback without a priority
       override will still execute "save" at its configured level.

   Request Callbacks
       Request callbacks come in two separate flavors: those that execute
       before the argument-triggered callbacks, and those that execute after
       the argument-triggered callbacks. All of them execute before the Mason
       component stack executes. Functional request callbacks may be specified
       via the "pre_callbacks" and "post_callbacks" parameters to new(),
       respectively:

         my $interp = MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks->new
           ( pre_callbacks  => [ \&translate, \&foobarate ],
             post_callbacks => [ \&escape, \&negate ] );

       Object-oriented request callbacks may be declared via the "PreCallback"
       and "PostCallback" method attributes, like so:

         sub translate : PreCallback { ... }
         sub foobarate : PreCallback { ... }
         sub escape : PostCallback { ... }
         sub negate : PostCallback { ... }

       In these examples, the translate() and foobarate() subroutines or
       methods will execute (in that order) before any argument-triggered
       callbacks are executed (none will be in these examples, since none are
       specified).

       Conversely, the escape() and negate() subroutines or methods will be
       executed (in that order) after all argument-triggered callbacks have
       been executed. And regardless of what argument-triggered callbacks may
       be triggered, the request callbacks will always be executed for every
       request.

       Although they may be used for different purposes, the "pre_callbacks"
       and "post_callbacks" functional callback code references expect the
       same argument as argument-triggered functional callbacks: a
       Params::Callback object:

         sub foo {
             my $cb = shift;
             # Do your business here.
         }

       Similarly, object-oriented request callback methods will be passed an
       object of the class defined in the class key portion of the callback
       trigger -- either an object of the class in which the callback is
       defined, or an object of a subclass:

         sub foo : PostCallback {
             my $self = shift;
             # ...
         }

       Of course, the attributes of the Params::Callback or subclass object
       will be different than in argument-triggered callbacks. For example,
       the "priority", "pkg_key", and "cb_key" attributes will naturally be
       undefined. It will, however, be the same instance of the object passed
       to all other functional callbacks -- or to all other class callbacks
       with the same class key -- in a single request.

       Like the argument-triggered callbacks, request callbacks are executed
       in a "eval {}" block, so if any of them "die"s, an
       Params::CallbackRequest::Exception::Execution exception will be thrown.
       Use the "cb_exception_handler" parameter to new() if you don't like
       this.

INTERFACE
   Parameters To The new() Constructor
       In addition to those offered by the HTML::Mason::Interp base class,
       this module supports a number of its own parameters to the new()
       constructor based on those required by Params::CallbackRequest. Each
       also has a corresponding httpd.conf variable as well, so, if you really
       want to, you can use MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks right in your
       httpd.conf file:

         PerlModule MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks
         PerlSetVar MasonInterpClass MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks
         SetHandler perl-script
         PerlHandler HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler

       The parameters to new() and their corresponding httpd.conf variables
       are as follows:

       "callbacks"
           Argument-triggered functional callbacks are configured via the
           "callbacks" parameter. This parameter is an array reference of hash
           references, and each hash reference specifies a single callback.
           The supported keys in the callback specification hashes are:

           "cb_key"
               Required. A string that, when found in a properly-formatted
               Mason request argument key, will trigger the execution of the
               callback.

           "cb"
               Required. A reference to the Perl subroutine that will be
               executed when the "cb_key" has been found in a Mason request
               argument key. Each code reference should expect a single
               argument: a Params::Callback object. The same instance of a
               Params::Callback object will be used for all functional
               callbacks in a single request.

           "pkg_key"
               Optional. A key to uniquely identify the package in which the
               callback subroutine is found. This parameter is useful in
               systems with many callbacks, where developers may wish to use
               the same "cb_key" for different subroutines in different
               packages. The default package key may be set via the
               "default_pkg_key" parameter.

           "priority"
               Optional. Indicates the level of priority of a callback. Some
               callbacks are more important than others, and should be
               executed before the others.  Params::CallbackRequest supports
               priority levels ranging from "0" (highest priority) to "9"
               (lowest priority). The default priority for functional
               callbacks may be set via the "default_priority" parameter.

           The <callbacks> parameter can also be specified via the httpd.conf
           configuration variable "MasonCallbacks". Use "PerlSetVar" to
           specify several callbacks; each one should be an "eval"able string
           that converts into a hash reference as specified here. For example,
           to specify two callbacks, use this syntax:

             PerlAddVar MasonCallbacks "{ cb_key  => 'foo', cb => sub { ... }"
             PerlAddVar MasonCallbacks "{ cb_key  => 'bar', cb => sub { ... }"

           Note that the "eval"able string must be entirely on its own line in
           the httpd.conf file.

       "pre_callbacks"
           This parameter accepts an array reference of code references that
           should be executed for every request before any other callbacks.
           They will be executed in the order in which they're listed in the
           array reference. Each code reference should expect a single
           Params::Callback argument. The same instance of a Params::Callback
           object will be used for all functional callbacks in a single
           request. Use pre-argument-triggered request callbacks when you want
           to do something with the arguments submitted for every request,
           such as convert character sets.

           The <pre_callbacks> parameter can also be specified via the
           httpd.conf configuration variable "MasonPreCallbacks". Use multiple
           "PerlAddVar" to add multiple pre-request callbacks; each one should
           be an "eval"able string that converts into a code reference:

             PerlAddVar MasonPreCallbacks "sub { ... }"
             PerlAddVar MasonPreCallbacks "sub { ... }"

       "post_callbacks"
           This parameter accepts an array reference of code references that
           should be executed for every request after all other callbacks have
           been called. They will be executed in the order in which they're
           listed in the array reference. Each code reference should expect a
           single Params::Callback argument. The same instance of a
           Params::Callback object will be used for all functional callbacks
           in a single request. Use post-argument-triggered request callbacks
           when you want to do something with the arguments submitted for
           every request, such as HTML-escape their values.

           The <post_callbacks> parameter can also be specified via the
           httpd.conf configuration variable "MasonPostCallbacks". Use
           multiple "PerlAddVar" to add multiple post-request callbacks; each
           one should be an "eval"able string that converts into a code
           reference:

             PerlAddVar MasonPostCallbacks "sub { ... }"
             PerlAddVar MasonPostCallbacks "sub { ... }"

       "cb_classes"
           An array reference listing the class keys of all of the
           Params::Callback subclasses containing callback methods that you
           want included in your MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks object.
           Alternatively, the "cb_classes" parameter may simply be the word
           "ALL", in which case all Params::Callback subclasses will have
           their callback methods registered with your
           MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks object. See the Params::Callback
           documentation for details on creating callback classes and methods.

           Note: Be sure to "use MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks" or "use
           Params::CallbackRequest" only after you've "use"d all of the
           Params::Callback subclasses you need or else you won't be able to
           use their callback methods.

           The <cb_classes> parameter can also be specified via the httpd.conf
           configuration variable "MasonCbClasses". Use multiple "PerlAddVar"
           to add multiple callback class keys. But, again, be sure to load
           MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks or Params::CallbackRequest only after
           you've loaded all of your MasonX::Callback handler subclasses:

             PerlModule My::CBClass
             PerlModule Your::CBClass
             PerlSetVar MasonCbClasses myCBClass
             PerlAddVar MasonCbClasses yourCBClass
             # Load MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks last!
             PerlModule MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks

       "default_priority"
           The priority level at which functional callbacks will be executed.
           Does not apply to object-oriented callbacks. This value will be
           used in each hash reference passed via the "callbacks" parameter to
           new() that lacks a "priority" key. You may specify a default
           priority level within the range of "0" (highest priority) to "9"
           (lowest priority). If not specified, it defaults to "5".

           Use the "MasonDefaultPriority" variable to set the the
           "default_priority" parameter in your httpd.conf file:

             PerlSetVar MasonDefaultPriority 3

       "default_pkg_key"
           The default package key for functional callbacks. Does not apply to
           object-oriented callbacks. This value that will be used in each
           hash reference passed via the "callbacks" parameter to new() that
           lacks a "pkg_key" key. It can be any string that evaluates to a
           true value, and defaults to "DEFAULT" if not specified.

           Use the "MasonDefaultPkgKey" variable to set the the
           "default_pkg_key" parameter in your httpd.conf file:

             PerlSetVar MasonDefaultPkgKey CBFoo

       "ignore_nulls"
           By default, Params::CallbackRequest will execute all request
           callbacks. However, in many situations it may be desirable to skip
           any callbacks that have no value for the callback field. One can do
           this by simply checking "$cb->value" in the callback, but if you
           need to disable the execution of all callbacks, pass the
           "ignore_nulls" parameter with a true value. It is set to a false
           value by default.

           Use the "MasonIgnoreNulls" variable to set the the "ignore_nulls"
           parameter in your httpd.conf file:

             PerlSetVar MasonIgnoreNulls 1

       "cb_exception_handler"
           When Params::CallbackRequest encounters an exception during the
           execution of callbacks, it normally calls
           "Params::CallbackRequest::Exceptions::rethrow_exception" to handle
           the exception. But if you throw your own exceptions in your
           callbacks, and want to handle them differently (say, to handle them
           and then let the request continue), pass the "cb_exception_handler"
           parameter a code reference to do what you need.

           Use the "MasonCbExceptionHandler" variable to set the
           "cb_exception_handler" parameter in your httpd.conf file:

             MasonCbExceptionHandler "sub {...}"

           Note: This is the only parameter that differs in name from the same
           parameter to "Params::CallbackRequest->new". This is so that it can
           be easily distinguished from the possible addition of a
           "exception_handler" parameter to a future version of Mason.

   Accessor Methods
       All of the above parameters to new() are passed to the
       Params::CallbackRequest constructor and deleted from the
       MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks object. MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks
       then contains a Params::CallbackRequest object that it uses to handle
       the execution of all callbacks for each request.

       cb_request

         my $interp = MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks->new;
         my $cb_request = $interp->cb_request;

       Returns the Params::CallbackRequest object in use during the execution
       of make_request().

       comp_path

         my $comp_path = $interp->comp_path;
         $interp->comp_path($comp_path);

       Returns the component path resolved by Mason during the execution of
       handle_request(). The cool thing is that it can be changed during the
       execution of callback methods:

         sub change_path :Callback {
             my $cb = shift;
             my $interp = $cb->requester;
             $inpter->comp_path($some_other_path);
         }

       In this example, we have overridden the component path determined by
       the Mason resolver in favor of an alternate component, which will be
       executed, instead.

       make_request

       Overrides and re-dispatches to "make_request" in HTML::Mason::Interp.

       purge_code_cache

       Overrides and re-dispatches to "purge_code_cache" in
       HTML::Mason::Interp.

   Requester
       The MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks object is available in all callback
       methods via the requester() accessor:

         sub access_interp :Callback {
             my $cb = shift;
             my $interp = $cb->requester;
             # ...
         }

   Notes
         $interp->cb_request->notes($key => $value);
         my $note = $interp->cb_request->notes($key);
         my $notes = $interp->cb_request->notes;

       The Params::CallbackRequest notes interface remains available via the
       notes() method of both Params::CallbackRequest and Params::Callback.
       Notes stored via this interface will be copied to the
       HTML::Mason::Request notes() interface before the execution of the
       request, and continue to be available for the lifetime of the Mason
       request via "$interp->cb_request->notes". Notes will be cleared out at
       the end of the request, just as with "$r->pnotes".

SEE ALSO
       Params::CallbackRequest handles the processing of the Mason request
       arguments and the execution of callbacks. See its documentation for the
       most up-to-date documentation of the underlying callback architecture.

       Params::Callback objects get passed as the sole argument to all
       functional callbacks, and offer access to data relevant to the
       callback. Params::Callback also defines the object-oriented callback
       interface, making its documentation a must-read for anyone who wishes
       to create callback classes and methods.

       This module works with HTML::Mason by subclassing HTML::Mason::Interp.
       Inspired by the implementation of callbacks in Bricolage
       (<http://bricolagecms.org/>), it is however a completely new code base
       with a rather different approach.
