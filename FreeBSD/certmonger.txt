NAME
       getcert


SYNOPSIS
       getcert add-ca [options]


DESCRIPTION
       Adds a CA configuration to certmonger, which can subsequently be used
       to enroll certificates.


OPTIONS
       -c NAME, --ca=NAME
              The nickname to give to this CA configuration.  This same value
              can later be passed in to getcert's request, resubmit, and
              start-tracking commands using the -c flag.

       -e COMMAND, --command=COMMAND
              The helper command to run for communicating with the CA.  The
              helper will be used to pass signing requests to the CA, relay
              the CA's responses back to the certmonger service, and to read
              information about the CA.

       -v, --verbose
              Be verbose about errors.  Normally, the details of an error
              received from the daemon will be suppressed if the client can
              make a diagnostic suggestion.
