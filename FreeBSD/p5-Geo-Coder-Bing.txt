NAME
       Geo::Coder::Bing - Geocode addresses with the Bing Maps API

SYNOPSIS
           use Geo::Coder::Bing;

           my $geocoder = Geo::Coder::Bing->new(key => 'Your Bing Maps key');
           my $location = $geocoder->geocode(
               location => 'Hollywood and Highland, Los Angeles, CA'
           );

DESCRIPTION
       The "Geo::Coder::Bing" module provides an interface to the Bing Maps
       geocoding service.

METHODS
   new
           $geocoder = Geo::Coder::Bing->new('Your Bing Maps key')
           $geocoder = Geo::Coder::Bing->new(
               key   => 'Your Bing Maps key',
               # https => 1,
               # debug => 1,
           )

       Creates a new geocoding object.

       A Bing Maps key can be obtained here:
       <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff428642.aspx>.

       Accepts an optional https parameter for securing network traffic.

       Accepts an optional ua parameter for passing in a custom LWP::UserAgent
       object.

   geocode
           $location = $geocoder->geocode(location => $location)
           @locations = $geocoder->geocode(location => $location)

       In scalar context, this method returns the first location result; and
       in list context it returns all location results.

       Any additional arguments will added to the request parameters. See the
       Bing Maps documention for the list of available parameters. An example:

           @locations = $geocoder->geocode(
               location            => $location,
               includeNeighborhood => 1,
               maxResults          => 20,
           )

       Each location result is a hashref; a typical example looks like:

           {
               __type =>
                   "Location:http://schemas.microsoft.com/search/local/ws/rest/v1",
               address => {
                   addressLine   => "Hollywood Blvd & N Highland Ave",
                   adminDistrict => "CA",
                   countryRegion => "United States",
                   formattedAddress =>
                       "Hollywood Blvd & N Highland Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90028",
                   locality   => "Los Angeles",
                   postalCode => 90028,
               },
               bbox => [
                   "34.0977008647939", "-118.344888641665",
                   "34.1054262999352", "-118.332449571785",
               ],
               confidence => "High",
               entityType => "RoadIntersection",
               name  => "Hollywood Blvd & N Highland Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90028",
               point => {
                   coordinates => [ "34.1015635823646", "-118.338669106725" ],
                   type        => "Point",
               },
           }

   reverse_geocode
           $location = $geocoder->reverse_geocode(lat => $lat, lon => $lon)
           $location = $geocoder->reverse_geocode(latlng => "$lat,$lon")

       Returns a location result for the given lat/lon pair.

   response
           $response = $geocoder->response()

       Returns an HTTP::Response object for the last submitted request. Can be
       used to determine the details of an error.

   ua
           $ua = $geocoder->ua()
           $ua = $geocoder->ua($ua)

       Accessor for the UserAgent object.

NOTES
       Starting with version 0.08, this module uses the REST API instead of
       the AJAX API. Backwards compatibility has been maintained, but its
       usage by this module is now deprecated, hence a warning is issued when
       a key is not provided to the constructor. Also note that the structure
       of the data returned from both APIs differs slightly.
