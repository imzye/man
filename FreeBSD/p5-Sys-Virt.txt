NAME
       Sys::Virt - Represent and manage a libvirt hypervisor connection

SYNOPSIS
         my $conn = Sys::Virt->new(uri => $uri);

         my @domains = $conn->list_domains();

         foreach my $dom (@domains) {
           print "Domain ", $dom->get_id, " ", $dom->get_name, "\n";
         }

DESCRIPTION
       The Sys::Virt module provides a Perl XS binding to the libvirt virtual
       machine management APIs. This allows machines running within arbitrary
       virtualization containers to be managed with a consistent API.

CALLBACK HANDLING
       Each callback registration routine returns a $callbackID (except for
       "domain_event_register" and "register_close_callback"). This return
       value must be retained and used for callback deregistration.

       IMPORTANT: All callbacks must be deregistered (including the ones
       registered using "domain_event_register" and
       "register_close_callback"); failing to do so prevents the "Sys::Virt"
       object from being garbage collected and the connection to "libvirtd"
       from being closed.

ERROR HANDLING
       Any operations in the Sys::Virt API which have failure scenarios will
       result in an instance of the Sys::Virt::Error module being thrown. To
       catch these errors, simply wrap the method in an eval block:

         eval { my $conn = Sys::Virt->new(uri => $uri); };
         if ($@) {
           print STDERR "Unable to open connection to $addr" . $@->message . "\n";
         }

       For details of the information contained in the error objects, consult
       the Sys::Virt::Error manual page.

METHODS
       my $conn = Sys::Virt->new(uri => $uri, readonly => $ro, flags =>
       $flags);
           Attach to the virtualization host identified by "uri". The "uri"
           parameter may be omitted, in which case the default connection made
           will be to the local Xen hypervisor. Some example URIs include:

           xen:///
               Xen on the local machine

           test:///default
               Dummy "in memory" driver for test suites

           qemu:///system
               System-wide driver for QEMU / KVM virtualization

           qemu:///session
               Per-user driver for QEMU virtualization

           qemu+tls://somehost/system
               System-wide QEMU driver on "somehost" using TLS security

           xen+tcp://somehost/
               Xen driver on "somehost" using TCP / SASL security

           For further details consult "http://libvirt.org/uri.html"

           If the optional "readonly" parameter is supplied, then an
           unprivileged connection to the hypervisor will be attempted. If it
           is not supplied, then it defaults to making a fully privileged
           connection to the hypervisor. If the calling application is not
           running as root, it may be necessary to provide authentication
           callbacks.

           If the optional "auth" parameter is set to a non-zero value,
           authentication will be enabled during connection, using the default
           set of credential gathering callbacks. The default callbacks prompt
           for credentials on the console, so are not suitable for graphical
           applications. For such apps a custom implementation should be
           supplied. The "credlist" parameter should be an array reference
           listing the set of credential types that will be supported. The
           credential constants in this module can be used as values in this
           list. The "callback" parameter should be a subroutine reference
           containing the code necessary to gather the credentials. When
           invoked it will be supplied with a single parameter, an array
           reference of requested credentials. The elements of the array are
           hash references, with keys "type" giving the type of credential,
           "prompt" giving a user descriptive user prompt, "challenge" giving
           name of the credential required. The answer should be collected
           from the user, and returned by setting the "result" key. This key
           may already be set with a default result if applicable

           As a simple example returning hardcoded credentials

               my $uri  = "qemu+tcp://192.168.122.1/system";
               my $username = "test";
               my $password = "123456";

               my $con = Sys::Virt->new(uri => $uri,
                                        auth => 1,
                                        credlist => [
                                          Sys::Virt::CRED_AUTHNAME,
                                          Sys::Virt::CRED_PASSPHRASE,
                                        ],
                                        callback =>
                    sub {
                          my $creds = shift;

                          foreach my $cred (@{$creds}) {
                             if ($cred->{type} == Sys::Virt::CRED_AUTHNAME) {
                                 $cred->{result} = $username;
                             }
                             if ($cred->{type} == Sys::Virt::CRED_PASSPHRASE) {
                                 $cred->{result} = $password;
                             }
                          }
                          return 0;
                    });

           For backwards compatibility with earlier releases, the "address"
           parameter is accepted as a synonym for the "uri" parameter. The use
           of "uri" is recommended for all newly written code.

       $conn->set_identity($identity, $flags=0)
           Change the identity that is used for access control over the
           connection. Normally the remote daemon will use the identity
           associated with the UNIX domain socket that the app opens.  Only a
           privileged client is usually able to override this.  The $identity
           should be a hash reference whose keys are one of the IDENTITY
           constants. The $flags parameter is currently unused, and defaults
           to 0 if omitted.

           Sys::Virt::Domain class. This method is not available with
           unprivileged connections to the hypervisor. The $flags parameter
           accepts one of the DOMAIN CREATION constants documented in

           an array of UNIX file descriptors which will be passed to the init
           process of the container. This is only supported with container
           based virtualization. The $flags parameter accepts one of the
           DOMAIN CREATION constants documented in Sys::Virt::Domain, and
           defaults to 0 if omitted.

           Create a new network filter binding based on the XML description
           passed into the $xml parameter. The returned object is an instance
           of the Sys::Virt::NWFilterBinding class. The $flags parameter
           accepts one of the NETWORK FILTER BINDING CREATION constants

           Defines, but does not start, a new storage pol based on the XML
           description passed into the $xml parameter. The returned object is
           an instance of the Sys::Virt::StoragePool class. This method is not
           available with unprivileged connections to the hypervisor. The
           defined pool can be later started by calling the "create" method on
           the returned "Sys::Virt::StoragePool" object. The $flags parameter
           accepts one of the STORAGE POOL DEFINE constants documented in
           Sys::Virt::StoragePool, and defaults to 0 if omitted.

       my $pool = $conn->create_interface($xml);
           Create a new interface based on the XML description passed into the
           $xml parameter. The returned object is an instance of the
           Sys::Virt::Interface class. This method is not available with
           unprivileged connections to the hypervisor.

       my $iface = $conn->define_interface($xml, $flags=0);
           Defines, but does not start, a new interface based on the XML

           defined interface can be later started by calling the "create"
           method on the returned "Sys::Virt::Interface" object. The $flags
           parameter accepts one of the INTERFACE DEFINE constants documented
           in Sys::Virt::Interface, and defaults to 0 if omitted.

       my $dev = $conn->create_node_device($xml, $flags=0);
           Create a new virtual node device based on the XML description
           passed into the $xml parameter. The returned object is an instance
           of the Sys::Virt::NodeDevice class. This method is not available
           with unprivileged connections to the hypervisor. The $flags
           parameter accepts one of the NODE DEVICE CREATION constants
           documented in Sys::Virt::NodeDevice, and defaults to 0 if omitted.

       my $dev = $conn->define_node_device($xml, $flags=0);

           description passed into the $xml parameter. The returned object is
           an instance of the Sys::Virt::NodeDevice class. This method is not
           available with unprivileged connections to the hypervisor. The
           defined node device can be later started by calling the "create"

           parameter accepts one of the NODE DEVICE DEFINE constants
           documented in Sys::Virt::NodeDevice, and defaults to 0 if omitted.

       my @doms = $conn->list_domains()
           Return a list of all running domains currently known to the
           hypervisor. The elements in the returned list are instances of the
           Sys::Virt::Domain class. This method requires O(n) RPC calls, so
           the "list_all_domains" method is recommended as a more efficient
           alternative.

       my $nids = $conn->num_of_domains()
           Return the number of running domains known to the hypervisor. This

       my @doms = $conn->list_defined_domains()
           Return a list of all domains defined, but not currently running, on
           the hypervisor. The elements in the returned list are instances of
           the Sys::Virt::Domain class. This method requires O(n) RPC calls,
           so the "list_all_domains" method is recommended as a more efficient
           alternative.

       my $ndoms = $conn->num_of_defined_domains()
           Return the number of running domains known to the hypervisor. This

           Return a list of names of all domains defined, but not currently
           running, on the hypervisor. The names can be used with the
           "get_domain_by_name" method.

       my @doms = $conn->list_all_domains($flags)
           Return a list of all domains currently known to the hypervisor,
           whether running or shutoff. The elements in the returned list are
           instances of the Sys::Virt::Domain class. The $flags parameter can
           be used to filter the list of returned domains.

       my @nets = $conn->list_networks()
           Return a list of all networks currently known to the hypervisor.
           The elements in the returned list are instances of the
           Sys::Virt::Network class.  This method requires O(n) RPC calls, so

           alternative.

       my $nnets = $conn->num_of_networks()
           Return the number of running networks known to the hypervisor. This

           on the hypervisor. The elements in the returned list are instances
           of the Sys::Virt::Network class. This method requires O(n) RPC
           calls, so the "list_all_networks" method is recommended as a more
           efficient alternative.

       my $nnets = $conn->num_of_defined_networks()
           Return the number of running networks known to the host. This can
           be used as the "maxnames" parameter to
           "list_defined_network_names".

           "get_network_by_name" method.

       my @nets = $conn->list_all_networks($flags)
           Return a list of all networks currently known to the hypervisor,
           whether running or shutoff. The elements in the returned list are
           instances of the Sys::Virt::Network class. The $flags parameter can
           be used to filter the list of returned networks.

       my @pools = $conn->list_storage_pools()
           Return a list of all storage pools currently known to the host. The
           elements in the returned list are instances of the
           Sys::Virt::StoragePool class.  This method requires O(n) RPC calls,
           so the "list_all_storage_pools" method is recommended as a more
           efficient alternative.

       my $npools = $conn->num_of_storage_pools()
           Return the number of running storage pools known to the hypervisor.
           This can be used as the "maxids" parameter to
           "list_storage_pool_names".

       my @poolNames = $conn->list_storage_pool_names($maxnames)
           Return a list of all storage pool names currently known to the
           hypervisor. The IDs can be used with the "get_network_by_id"
           method.

       my @pools = $conn->list_defined_storage_pools()
           Return a list of all storage pools defined, but not currently
           running, on the host. The elements in the returned list are
           instances of the Sys::Virt::StoragePool class. This method requires

           recommended as a more efficient alternative.

       my $npools = $conn->num_of_defined_storage_pools()
           Return the number of running networks known to the host. This can
           be used as the "maxnames" parameter to
           "list_defined_storage_pool_names".

       my @names = $conn->list_defined_storage_pool_names($maxnames)
           Return a list of names of all storage pools defined, but not
           currently running, on the host. The names can be used with the
           "get_storage_pool_by_name" method.

       my @pools = $conn->list_all_storage_pools($flags)
           Return a list of all storage pools currently known to the
           hypervisor, whether running or shutoff. The elements in the
           returned list are instances of the Sys::Virt::StoragePool class.
           The $flags parameter can be used to filter the list of returned
           pools.

       my @devs = $conn->list_node_devices($capability)
           Return a list of all devices currently known to the host OS. The
           elements in the returned list are instances of the
           Sys::Virt::NodeDevice class.  The optional "capability" parameter
           allows the list to be restricted to only devices with a particular
           capability type. This method requires O(n) RPC calls, so the
           "list_all_node_devices" method is recommended as a more efficient
           alternative.

       my $ndevs = $conn->num_of_node_devices($capability[, $flags])
           Return the number of host devices known to the hypervisor. This can
           be used as the "maxids" parameter to "list_node_device_names".  The
           "capability" parameter allows the list to be restricted to only
           devices with a particular capability type, and should be left as
           "undef" if the full list is required. The optional <flags>
           parameter is currently unused and defaults to 0 if omitted.

       my @devNames = $conn->list_node_device_names($capability, $maxnames[,
       $flags])

           instance of "Sys::Virt::Domain" for the domain changing state, and
           a "event" and "detail" arguments, corresponding to the event
           constants defined in the "Sys::Virt::Domain" module. Before
           discarding the connection object, the callback must be
           deregistered, otherwise the connection object memory will never be
           released in garbage collection.

       $conn->domain_event_deregister()
           Unregister a callback, allowing the connection object to be garbage
           collected.

           domains, or a specific "Sys::Virt::Domain" object to filter events.
           The $eventID parameter is one of the EVENT ID constants described
           later in this document. The $callback is a subroutine reference
           that will receive the events.

           All callbacks receive a "Sys::Virt" connection as the first
           parameter and a "Sys::Virt::Domain" object indicating the domain on
           which the event occurred as the second parameter. Subsequent
           parameters vary according to the event type

               "devAlias" is the unique device alias from the guest
               configuration associated with "srcPath". The "action" is the
               action taken as a result of the error, one of the IO ERROR
               constants described later

           EVENT_ID_GRAPHICS
               The "phase" is the stage of the connection, one of the GRAPHICS
               PHASE constants described later. The "local" and "remote"
               parameters follow with the details of the local and remote
               network addresses. The "authScheme" describes how the user was
               authenticated (if at all). Finally "identities" is an array ref
               containing authenticated identities for the user, if any.

       $callback)
           Register a callback to received notifications of storage pool
           events.  The $pool parameter can be "undef" to request events on

           object to filter events. The $eventID parameter is one of the EVENT
           ID constants described later in this document. The $callback is a
           subroutine reference that will receive the events.

           All callbacks receive a "Sys::Virt" connection as the first
           parameter and a "Sys::Virt::StoragePool" object indicating the

           events.  The $dev parameter can be "undef" to request events on all
           known node devices, or a specific "Sys::Virt::NodeDevice" object to
           filter events. The $eventID parameter is one of the EVENT ID
           constants described later in this document. The $callback is a
           subroutine reference that will receive the events.

           All callbacks receive a "Sys::Virt" connection as the first
           parameter and a "Sys::Virt::NodeDevice" object indicating the node
           device on which the event occurred as the second parameter.
           Subsequent parameters vary according to the event type

           EVENT_ID_LIFECYCLE

           Checks whether the CPU definition in $xml is compatible with the
           current hypervisor connection. This can be used to determine
           whether it is safe to migrate a guest to this host. The returned
           result is one of the constants listed later The optional $flags
           parameter can take one of the following constants

           Sys::Virt::COMPARE_CPU_FAIL_INCOMPATIBLE

           Returns information about the number of pages free on each NUMA
           cell between $start and $end inclusive. The @pagesizes parameter
           should be an arrayref specifying which pages sizes information
           should be returned for. Information about supported page sizes is
           available in the capabilities XML. The returned array has an
           element for each NUMA cell requested. The elements are hash
           references with two keys, 'cell' specifies the NUMA cell number and
           'pages' specifies the free page information for that cell. The
           'pages' value is another hash reference where the keys are the page
           sizes and the values are the free count for that size.

       $con->node_alloc_pages(\@pages, $start, $end, $flags=0)
           Allocate further huge pages for the reserved dev. The "\@pages"
           parameter is an array reference with one entry per page size to
           allocate for. Each entry is a further array reference where the
           first element is the page size and the second element is the page
           count. The same number of pages will be allocated on each NUMA node
           in the range $start to $end inclusive. The $flags parameter accepts
           two constants

           Sys::Virt::NODE_ALLOC_PAGES_ADD
               The requested number of pages will be added to the existing
