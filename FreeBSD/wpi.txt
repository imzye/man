WPI(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 WPI(4)

NAME
     wpi – Intel 3945ABG Wireless LAN IEEE 802.11 driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device wpi
           device wpifw
           device pci
           device wlan
           device wlan_amrr
           device firmware

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           if_wpi_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The wpi driver provides support for the Intel 3945ABG Wireless network
     adapter.  The driver supports station, adhoc, adhoc-demo, hostap, and
     monitor mode operation.  Only one virtual interface may be configured at
     any time.

     The wpi driver can be configured to use Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) or
     Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA-PSK and WPA2-PSK).  WPA is the de facto
     encryption standard for wireless networks.  It is strongly recommended
     that WEP not be used as the sole mechanism to secure wireless
     communication, due to serious weaknesses in it.  The wpi driver offloads
     both encryption and decryption of data frames to the hardware for the
     CCMP cipher.

     This driver requires the firmware built with the wpifw 4 module to work.

     The wpi driver can be configured at runtime with ifconfig(8).

EXAMPLES
     Join an existing BSS network (i.e., connect to an access point):

           ifconfig wlan0 create wlandev wpi0 inet 192.168.0.20 \
               netmask 0xffffff00

     Join a specific BSS network with network name “my_net”:

           ifconfig wlan0 create wlandev wpi0 ssid my_net up

     Join a specific BSS network with 64-bit WEP encryption:

           ifconfig wlan0 create wlandev wpi0 ssid my_net \
                   wepmode on wepkey 0x1234567890 weptxkey 1 up

     Create an IBSS network with 128-bit WEP encryption on the channel 4:

           ifconfig wlan0 create wlandev wpi0 wlanmode adhoc ssid my_net \
                   wepmode on wepkey 0x01020304050607080910111213 weptxkey 1 \
                   channel 4

     Join/create an 802.11b IBSS network with network name “my_net”:

           ifconfig wlan0 create wlandev wpi0 wlanmode adhoc
           ifconfig wlan0 inet 192.168.0.22 netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_net \
                   mode 11b

     Create an 802.11g host-based access point:

           ifconfig wlan0 create wlandev wpi0 wlanmode hostap
           ifconfig wlan0 inet 192.168.0.10 netmask 0xffffff00 ssid my_ap \
                   mode 11g

DIAGNOSTICS
     wpi%d: could not load firmware image '%s'  The driver failed to load the
     firmware image using the firmware(9) subsystem.  Verify the wpifw(4)
     firmware module is installed.

     wpi%d: %s: timeout waiting for adapter to initialize, error %d  The
     onboard microcontroller failed to initialize in time.  This should not
     happen.

     wpi%d: %s: could not load boot firmware  An attempt to upload the boot
     firmware image to the onboard microcontroller failed.  This should not
     happen.

     wpi%d: device timeout  A frame dispatched to the hardware for
     transmission did not complete in time.  The driver will reset the
     hardware and continue.  This should not happen.

     wpi%d: scan timeout  Firmware scan command response was not received in
     time.  The driver will reset the hardware and continue.  This should not
     happen.

     wpi%d: fatal firmware error  The onboard microcontroller crashed for some
     reason.  The driver will reset the hardware and continue.  This should
     not happen.

     wpi%d: RF switch: radio disabled  The hardware switch controlling the
     radio is currently turned off.  Data transmission is not possible in this
     state.

     wpi%d: can't map mem space  The driver was unable to map the device
     registers into the host address space.  This should not happen.

     wpi%d: can't map interrupt  The driver was unable to allocate an IRQ for
     the device interrupt.  This should not happen.

     wpi%d: can't establish interrupt, error %d  The driver was unable to
     install the device interrupt handler.  This should not happen.

     wpi%d: %s: bus_dmamap_load failed, error %d  The driver was unable to map
     newly allocated mbuf to device visible address space.  Contents of
     currently received frame will be lost.  This should not happen.

AUTHORS
     The original wpi driver was written for OpenBSD by Damien Bergamini
     <damien.bergamini@free.fr>.  Benjamin Close <benjsc@FreeBSD.org> ported
     wpi to FreeBSD.

CAVEATS
     Hostap mode is not directly supported by the device; it is implemented
     through IBSS mode (as a result, DFS/passive channels are not available in
     this mode).

     Powersave may be unstable on some networks (results in occasional 'wpi%d:
     device timeout' messages); you can try to disable it to improve device
     stability.
