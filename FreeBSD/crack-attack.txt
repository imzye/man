crack-attack(6)              FreeBSD Games Manual              crack-attack(6)

NAME
       crack-attack - multiplayer OpenGL puzzle game like "Tetris Attack"

SYNOPSIS
       crack-attack { { [--server PORT] | [--wait] } { [SERVER] | [PORT] } {
       [--solo] [ [--easy] | [--medium] | [--hard] ] } } [--name NAME] [-X]

DESCRIPTION
       Crack Attack is roughly based on the Super Nintendo game "Tetris
       Attack". Slowly, your stack of colored blocks grows from the bottom,
       and you've got to make sure it never reaches the top. If it does, you
       lose. To eliminate blocks from the stack, line up at least three of one
       color, horizontally or vertically. Once you do, those blocks disappear,
       and put off slightly your inevitable demise.

       Crack Attack essentially requires hardware acceleration. For XFree
       users, this means you want DRI.

OPTIONS
       solo   Creates a solo game versus yourself. The goal is to gain as many
              points as possible. If an AI level is specified, then the game
              is played versus a computer and the goal is to defeat the
              computer player in as little time as possible.
