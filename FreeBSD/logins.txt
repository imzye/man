NAME
     logins – display account information

SYNOPSIS
     logins [-admopstux] [-g groups] [-l logins]

DESCRIPTION
     The logins utility displays information about user and system accounts.

     The following options are available:

     -a               Display information about the password change and
                      account expiration times for each account.

     -d               Select accounts with duplicate UIDs.

     -g groups        Select accounts that are members of the specified
                      groups.  If multiple group names are specified, they
                      must be separated with commas.

     -l logins        Select accounts matching the specified login names.  If
                      multiple names are specified, they must be separated
                      with commas.

     -m               Show information about secondary groups.

     -o               Display the information for each account on a single
                      line of colon-separated fields.

     -p               Select accounts with no password.

     -s               Select system accounts.  These are currently defined as
                      accounts with UIDs below 1000, plus the “nobody” account
                      (UID 65534).

     -t               Sort selected accounts by name rather than by UID.

     -u               Select user accounts.  These are currently defined as
                      accounts with UIDs above 1000, except the “nobody”
                      account (UID 65534).

     -x               Display information about each account's home directory
                      and shell.

     If multiple selection options are specified, all accounts matching any of
     the selection criteria will be displayed.

     If no selection options are specified, all accounts will be displayed.
