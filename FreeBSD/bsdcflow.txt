ASMGRAPH(1)             FreeBSD General Commands Manual            ASMGRAPH(1)

NAME
     asmgraph – build call graphs from assembler files

SYNOPSIS
     asmgraph [-acgnr] [-d num] [-i incl] [-R root] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The asmgraph utility reads assembler source code files and prints call
     graphs from their contents.

OPTIONS
     The following options are supported:

     -a      Use the GNU as(1) syntax parser for assembler files.

     -c      Print all calls within a function, including subsequent
             invocations of the same function.

     -d num  The depth at which the graph is cut off. The num argument must be
             a positive integer >=0.

     -g      Produce a dot(1) graph for graphviz output.

     -i incl
             Increase the number of included symbols. The incl argument can be
             one of the following characters:

                   x   Include external and static data symbols.

                   _   Include names that begin with an underscore.

     -n      Use the nasm(1) syntax parser for assembler files. This flag will
             be the default, if neither [-a] nor [-n] are set.

     -r      Print the flowgraph in reversed order, producing an inverted
             listing showing the callers of each function.

     -R root
             The function to use as root function. The default is "main". If
             set to a name, that cannot be found in the file, all functions
             are printed.
