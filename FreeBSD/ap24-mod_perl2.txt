NAME
       APR - Perl Interface for Apache Portable Runtime (libapr and libaprutil
       Libraries)

Synopsis
         use APR ();

Description
       On load this modules prepares the APR enviroment (initializes memory
       pools, data structures, etc.)

       You don't need to use this module explicitly, since it's already loaded
       internally by all "APR::*" modules.

Using APR modules outside mod_perl 2.0
       You'd use the "APR::*" modules outside mod_perl 2.0, just like you'd
       use it with mod_perl 2.0. For example to get a random unique string you
       could call:

         % perl -MAPR::UUID -le 'print APR::UUID->new->format'
