VFS_MOUNT(9)           FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual          VFS_MOUNT(9)

NAME
     VFS_MOUNT – mount a file system

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <sys/mount.h>
     #include <sys/vnode.h>

     int
     VFS_MOUNT(struct mount *mp);

DESCRIPTION
     The VFS_MOUNT() macro mounts a file system into the system's namespace or
     updates the attributes of an already mounted file system.

     The arguments it expects are:

     mp    Structure representing the file system.

     The VFS_MOUNT() macro is called both to mount new file systems and to
     change the attributes of an existing file system.  If the MNT_UPDATE flag
     is set in mp->mnt_flag then the file system should update its internal
     state from the value of mp->mnt_flag.  This can be used, for instance, to
     convert a read-only file system to read-write.  It is also used by
     mountd(8) to update the NFS export information for the file system.

     If the MNT_UPDATE flag is not specified, then this is a newly mounted
     file system.  The file system code should allocate and initialize any
     private data needed to represent the file system (it can use the
     mp->mnt_data field to store this information).
