NAME
       VCP::Dest::svk - svk destination driver

SYNOPSIS
          vcp <source> svk:/path/to/repos:path
          vcp <source> svk:/path/to/repos:path --init-repos
          vcp <source> svk:/path/to/repos:path --init-repos --delete-repos

          # source could be cvs:/path/to/cvsrepos:module/... or
          # cvs::pserver:anonymous@cvs.server.org:/repos:module/...

DESCRIPTION
       This driver allows vcp to insert revisions in to a Subversion
       repository via the svk interface. You could use the vcp command line
       interface or the integrated SVK mirror command.

OPTIONS
       --init-repos
           Initializes a SVN repository in the directory indicated.  Refuses
           to init a non-empty directory.

       --delete-repos
           If "--init-repos" is passed and the target directory is not empty,
           it will be deleted.  THIS IS DANGEROUS AND SHOULD ONLY BE USED IN
           TEST ENVIRONMENTS.

       --nolayout
           Do not create conventional layout for trunk and branches.

       --trunk-dir
           The directory for trunk. default is trunk.

       --branch-dir
           The directory for branches. default is branches.

NOTES
       •   Since VCP is not currently available on CPAN, you could get a dist
           with fixes from
           <http://wagner.elixus.org/~clkao/VCP-0.9-clkao.tar.gz>

       •   "VCP::Dest::svk" uses branch info to decide the path in the
           resulting repository.  So source repository with branches denoted
           by path names like Perforce should normalize the path name and
           branch info. see SVN::Mirror::VCP for example.
