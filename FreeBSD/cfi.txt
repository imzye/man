NAME
     cfi, cfid – driver for Common Flash Interface (CFI) NOR flash

SYNOPSIS
     device cfi
     device cfid
     options CFI_SUPPORT_STRATAFLASH
     options CFI_ARMEDANDDANGEROUS

     In /boot/device.hints:
     hint.cfi.0.at="nexus0"
     hint.cfi.0.maddr=0x74000000
     hint.cfi.0.msize=0x4000000

     In DTS file:
     flash@74000000 {
       compatible = "cfi-flash";
       reg = <0x74000000 0x4000000>;
     };

DESCRIPTION
     The cfi device driver provides a management interface to NOR flash
     devices supporting the Common Flash Interface (CFI) specification.  Its
     companion device cfid provides a geom(4) disk interface to the device.

     Special support for features of the Intel StrataFlash line are available
     with the CFI_SUPPORT_STRATAFLASH kernel option.  Additional support for
     write-once bits to switch part of Intel StrataFlash devices to read-only
     can be enabled by the CFI_ARMEDANDDANGEROUS kernel option.
