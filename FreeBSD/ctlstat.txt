CTLSTAT(8)              FreeBSD System Manager's Manual             CTLSTAT(8)

NAME
     ctlstat – CAM Target Layer statistics utility

SYNOPSIS
     ctlstat [-t] [-c count] [-C] [-d] [-D] [-j] [-l lun] [-n numdevs]
             [-p port] [-w wait]

DESCRIPTION
     The ctlstat utility provides statistics information for the CAM Target
     Layer.  The first display (except for dump and JSON modes) shows average
     statistics since system startup.  Subsequent displays show average
     statistics during the measurement interval.

     The options are as follows:

     -t          Total mode.  This displays separate columns with the total
                 read and write output, and a combined total column that also
                 includes non I/O operations.

     -c count    Display statistics this many times.

     -C          Disable CPU statistics display.

     -d          Display DMA operation time (latency) instead of overall I/O
                 time (latency).

     -D          Text dump mode.  Dump statistics every 30 seconds in a text
                 format suitable for parsing.  No statistics are computed in
                 this mode, only raw numbers are displayed.

     -h          Suppress display of the header.

     -j          JSON dump mode.  Dump statistics every 30 seconds in
                 JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format.  No statistics are
                 computed in this mode, only raw numbers are displayed.

     -l lun      Request statistics for the specified LUN.

     -n numdevs  Display statistics for this many devices.

     -p port     Request statistics for the specified port.

     -w wait     Wait this many seconds in between displays.  If this option
                 is not specified, ctlstat defaults to a 1 second interval.

EXAMPLES
           ctlstat -t

     Display total statistics for the system with a one second interval.

           ctlstat -d -l 5 -C

     Display average DMA time for LUN 5 and omit CPU utilization.

           ctlstat -n 7 -w 10

     Display statistics for the first 7 LUNs, and display average statistics
     every 10 seconds.
