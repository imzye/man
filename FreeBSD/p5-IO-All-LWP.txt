NAME
       IO::All::FTP - Extends IO::All to FTP URLs

SYNOPSIS
           use IO::All;

           "hello world\n" > io('ftp://localhost/test/x');  # save to FTP
           io('ftp//example.org/pub/xyz') > io('xyz');      # GET to file

           # two ways of getting a file with a password:
           $content < io('ftp://me:secret@example.org/xyz');
           $content < io('ftp://example.org/xyz')->user('me')->password('secret');

DESCRIPTION
       This module extends IO::All for dealing with FTP URLs.  Note that you
       don't need to use it explicitly, as it is autoloaded by IO::All
       whenever it sees something that looks like an FTP URL.

METHODS
       This is a subclass of IO::All::LWP. The only new method is "ftp", which
       can be used to create a blank IO::All::FTP object; or it can also take
       an FTP URL as a parameter. Note that in most cases it is simpler just
       to call io('ftp//example.com'), which calls the "ftp" method
       automatically.

OPERATOR OVERLOADING
       The same operators from IO::All may be used. < GETs an FTP URL; > PUTs
       to an FTP URL.

SEE ALSO
       IO::All::LWP, IO::All, LWP.
