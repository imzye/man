BL_ALIGN_MAX_MISMATCH_PERCENT(3)              FreeBSD Library Functions Manual




LIBRARY
       #include <biolibc/align.h>
       -lbiolibc -lxtend




SYNOPSIS
       BL_ALIGN_MAX_MISMATCH_PERCENT(ptr)


ARGUMENTS
       ptr             Pointer to a bl_align_t structure


DESCRIPTION
       Accessor macro for max_mismatch_percent.  Use this macro to reference
       max_mismatch_percent in a bl_align_t structure from functions that are
       not members of the class.  This allows separation of implementation
       from interface.  While the implementation of the bl_align_t structure
       may change, effort is made to preserve the API of functions and macros
       used to access it.


EXAMPLES
       bl_align_t      bl_align;
       unsigned        max_mismatch_percent;

       max_mismatch_percent = BL_ALIGN_MAX_MISMATCH_PERCENT(&bl_align);
