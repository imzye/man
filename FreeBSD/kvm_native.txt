NAME
     kvm_native – is a kvm descriptor opened on a native kernel image

LIBRARY
     Kernel Data Access Library (libkvm, -lkvm)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <kvm.h>

     int
     kvm_native(kvm_t *kd);

DESCRIPTION
     The kvm library provides an interface for accessing kernel virtual memory
     images for both native kernel images (where the ABI of the kernel
     executable matches the host system) and non-native kernel images.  The
     kvm_native() function returns a non-zero value if the kvm descriptor kd
     is attached to a native kernel image; otherwise it returns zero.

RETURN VALUES
     The kvm_native() function returns a non-zero value if the kvm descriptor
     kd is attached to a native kernel image; otherwise it returns zero.
