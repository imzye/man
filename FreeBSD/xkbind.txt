       xkbind [-display displayname] [-force] [-nodetach] [-defgrp group]
       [-deflbl label] [-label0 label] [-label1 label] [-label2 label]

DESCRIPTION
       The xkbind program (X Keyboard Extention Indicator) is a small and
       light indicator of keyboard layout (XKB group) for  the X Window
       System; it shows current keyboard layout in titles of top-level
       windows.  xkbind allows to simulate separate keyboard layout for each
       handled window and it works with most of window managers.

       xkbind exits 0 on success, and greater than 0 if an error occurs.

OPTIONS
       xkbind accepts a number options most of which can be specified either
       on the command line, in the user's $HOME/.xkbindrc, $HOME/.Xdefaults
       (or $HOME/.Xresources), or in the system-wide configuration file.
       Description of all the acceptable options is given below.  The command
       line option is specified first with correspondent X resource name (if
       any) in parenthesis afteward.  Options specified on the command line
       have the highest priority.  The -version and -help options interpreted
       even if xkbind can not open the display.

       -help  Print a short help message to stderr and exit.

       -version
              Print a version number of xkbind to stderr and exit.

       -force Do not allow xkbind automatically check existence of its own
              copy already running on the specified X server.

       -nodetach
              Do not detach as a background process.

       -display displayname (display)
              The X server to use.  This option overrides the contents of
              DISPLAY environment variable.

       -defgrp group (defgroup)
              Group number that xkbind initially binds to each handled window.

       -deflbl label (label.default)
              The default value for options label.group[0-3].

       -label[0-3] label (label.group[0-3])
              A label string for the specified keyboard group.

       -iname <name list> (ignore.name)
              Space- or tab-separated list of window names (WM_CLASS(res_name)
              property) that should be ignored by xkbind.

       -iclass <class list> (ignore.class)
              Space- or tab-separated list of window classes
              (WM_CLASS(res_class) property) that should be ignored by xkbind.

       -reverse (ignore.reverse)
              Indicates that the "ignore list" in options ignore.name and
              ignore.class should be interpreted as "accept list"

       -nowild (ignore.usewild)
              Disable pattern matching while searching in window lists.

RESOURCES
       The format of the option in the X resources files is "Xkbind.option:
       value", where the option name is the one specified below.

       display
              The X server to use.  The default is the contents of environment
              variable DISPLAY.

       defgroup
              Group number that xkbind initially binds to each handled window.
              The default is the current group when the program starts.

       label.default
              The default value for options label.group[0-3].  It defaults
              itself to the empty string.

       label.group[0-3]
              A label string for the specified keyboard group.  The default is
              the value of label.default option.

       ignore.name
              Space- or tab-separated list of window names (WM_CLASS(res_name)
              property) that should be ignored by xkbind.

       ignore.class
              Space- or tab-separated list of window classes
              (WM_CLASS(res_class) property) that should be ignored by xkbind.

       ignore.reverse
              Specifies whether or not an "ignore list" in options ignore.name
              and ignore.class should be interpreted as an "accept list".  The

       ignore.usewild
              Specifies whether or not symbols '*', '?' and '\' in the name
              and class lists should be interpreted in the special way (like
              in the shell pattern matching).  The default is "True".
