DESCRIPTION
       nxsh ?-c ?arg1?? ?arg2 ...?
              nxsh is a shell-like application that reads NX and Tcl commands
              from different sources and evaluates them.

              If invoked without any arguments, nxsh runs in read-eval-print
              mode (REPL, interactive) similar to tclsh. In this mode, it
              reads commands from standard input interactively and prints
              command results as well as error messages to standard output. It
              remains active until the exit command is invoked or until it
              reaches end-of-file on its standard input.

              If invoked with at least one positional argument arg1, nxsh runs
              a NX/Tcl script sourced from a file identified by arg1 using
              source.

              Passing the -c flag makes nxsh accept commands from the command
              line provided by arg1. If arg1 is omitted, nxsh takes commands
              from standard input (e.g., in a pipe).

              nxsh can be used like tclsh to make NX scripts directly
              invocable from the shell, by providing the following first line
              ("shebang") in the respective script:


                #! /usr/bin/env nxsh


              A (more portable) alternative is:


                #! /bin/sh
                # the next line restarts using nxsh \
                    exec nxsh "$0" "$@"
