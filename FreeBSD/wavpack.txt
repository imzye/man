WAVPACK(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             WAVPACK(1)

NAME
     wavpack – encode audio files to wavpack

SYNOPSIS
     wavpack [-options] [-o output] file ...

DESCRIPTION
     wavpack encodes the specified source files into WavPack files.  The
     source files may be any of the file format types listed below, and the
     audio data may be either uncompressed PCM or DSD, depending on the
     format.  Raw audio may also be specified (see --raw-pcm).

     Unless overridden with the -o option, the output filename will be the
     source filename with the filename extension replaced by “.wv”.  Multiple
     input files may be specified, resulting in multiple WavPack files, and in
     that case -o may be used to specify an alternate target directory.  A
     filename of “-” specifies stdin or stdout.

     When transcoding from existing WavPack files, all tags are copied, and
     may be modified with additional args; unless an alternate output file or
     directory is specified, the source files are safely overwritten.

     On multicore machines wavpack will attempt to use several threads to
     speed up the operation, often significantly.  This does not apply to the
     hybrid mode (except with multichannel files).  To force single-threaded
     operation use the --no-threads option, or use the --threads option to
     fine-tune the number of threads utilized.

   INPUT FORMATS
     •   Microsoft RIFF, extension “.wav”, including BWF and RF64 variants
     •   WavPack, extension “.wv”, transcode operation, tags copied
     •   Apple AIFF, extension “.aif”
     •   Apple Core Audio, extension “.caf”
     •   Sony Wave64, extension “.w64”
     •   Philips DSDIFF, extension “.dff”
     •   Sony DSD Stream, extension “.dsf”

   OPTIONS
     -a      Adobe Audition (CoolEdit) mode for 32-bit floats

     --allow-huge-tags
             Allow tag data up to 16 MB.  Embedding > 1 MB is not recommended
             for portable devices and may not work with some programs,
             including older WavPack versions.

     -bn     Enable hybrid compression, n = 2.0 to 23.9 bits/sample, or n =
             24-9600 kbits/second (kbps). If this option is specified without
             the -c option, then the operation is lossy.  The hybrid mode is
             not applicable to DSD audio (only PCM).

     --blocksize=n
             specify block size in samples (max = 131072 and min = 16 with
             --merge-blocks, otherwise 128)

     -c      Create correction file (.wvc) for hybrid mode resulting in 2-file
             lossless compression.  The bitrate is specified with the -bn
             option.

     -cc     maximum hybrid compression (hurts lossy quality & decode speed)

     -cn     Enable hybrid lossless (i.e., 2-file) compression, n = 2.0 to
             23.9 bits/sample, or n = 24-9600 kbits/second (kbps). This is a
             shortcut combining the -bn and -c options.  The hybrid mode is
             not applicable to DSD audio (only PCM).

     --channel-order=list
             Specify comma separated channel order if not the Microsoft
             standard, which is
             FL,FR,FC,LFE,BL,BR,FLC,FRC,BC,SL,SR,TC,TFL,TFC,TFR,TBL,TBC,TBR;
             specify “...” to indicate that channels are not assigned to
             specific speakers, or terminate list with “...” to indicate that
             any channels beyond those specified are unassigned.

     --cross-decorr
             Use cross-channel correlation in hybrid mode.  On by default in
             lossless mode and with the -cc option.

     -d      delete source file if successful; use with caution!

     -f      fast mode; introduces a compromise in compression ratio

     --force-even-byte-depth
             Round the bit depth specified in the source file up to the next
             whole byte (e.g., 20-bit is rounded up to 24-bit) to handle cases
             where the value specified is not correct (i.e., padding bits are
             non-zero).

     -g      general/normal mode, cancels previously specified -f and -h
             options

     -h      high quality; better compression ratio, but slightly slower

     -hh     very high quality; best compression, but slowest; not recommended
             on vintage playback devices

     --help  display extended help

     -i      Ignore length in wav header and allow WAV files greater than 4
             GB.  This will attempt to fix the WAV header stored in the
             WavPack file; combine with -r to create a fresh header instead.

     --import-id3
             import applicable tag items from an ID3v2.3 or ID3v2.4 tag
             present in DSF and other files into the APEv2 tag.  If there are
             > 1 MB cover images present, add --allow-huge-tags to include
             them, and -r if you do not want large images appearing twice in
             the WavPack file, although this will remove the entire original
             ID3v2 tag.

     -jn     joint-stereo override (0 = left/right, 1 = mid/side)

     -m      compute & store MD5 signature of raw audio data

     --merge-blocks
             merge consecutive blocks with equal redundancy (used with
             --blocksize option and is useful for files generated by the
             lossyWAV program or decoded HDCD files)

     -n      calculate average and peak quantization noise (hybrid only,
             reference fullscale sine)

     --no-overwrite
             Never overwrite, nor ask to overwrite, an existing file.  This is
             handy for resuming a cancelled batch operation and obviously
             cannot be mixed with the -y option.

     --no-threads
             force single-threaded operation, equivalent to --threads=1

     --no-utf8-convert
             Don't recode passed tags from local encoding to UTF-8, assume
             they are in UTF-8 already.

     -o outfile
             Specify an output filename for a single source file or a target
             directory (must already exist) for multiple files.

     --optimize-int32
             New optimization targeting 32-bit integer audio files that were
             originally sourced from 32-bit float audio.  Can improve
             compression by 10%, but is only applicable in lossless modes.
             Resulting files will only decode with 24-bit resolution on older
             decoders (i.e., technically lossy).

     --pair-unassigned-chans
             encode unassigned channels into stereo pairs

     --pre-quantize=bits
             pre-quantize samples to bits depth BEFORE encoding and MD5
             calculation (common use would be --pre-quantize=20 for 24-bit or
             float material recorded with typical converters)

     -q      quiet (keep console output to a minimum)

     -r      parse headers to determine audio format and length but do not
             store the headers in the resulting WavPack file (a minimum header
             will be generated by wvunpack, but some non-audio metadata might
             be lost)

     --raw-pcm
             input data is raw pcm (44,100 Hz, 16-bit, 2-channels)

     --raw-pcm=sr,bits[f|s|u],chans,[le|be]
             Input data is raw pcm with specified sample-rate, bit-depth
             (float, unsigned, signed), number of channels, and endianness.
             Defaulted parameters may be omitted, specify bits=1 for DSD.

     --raw-pcm-skip=begin[,end]
             skip begin bytes before encoding raw PCM (header) and skip end
             bytes at the EOF (trailer)

     -sn     Override default hybrid mode noise shaping where n is a float
             value between -1.0 and 1.0.  Negative values move noise lower in
             freq, positive values move noise higher in freq; use 0 for no
             shaping (white noise).

     -t      Copy input file's time stamp to output files.

     --threads=n
             Enable (or disable) multithreaded operation with n=1 (no
             threading) to n=12 (max threads).  Significantly improves the
             speed of lossless compression on multicore CPUs.  In the hybrid
             modes, only multichannel files can utilize multithreading.
             Omitting the parameter will select an optimum number of threads.

     --use-dns
             force use of dynamic noise shaping (hybrid mode only)

     -v      verify output file integrity after write (not for piped output)

     --version
             write program version to stdout

     -w -Encoder
             write encoder metadata to APEv2 tag (e.g., “Encoder=WavPack
             5.8.0”)

     -w -Settings
             write user settings metadata to APEv2 tag (e.g.,
             “Settings=-hb384cx3”)

     -w “Field=Value”
             write the specified text metadata to APEv2 tag

     -w “Field=@file.ext”
             Write specified text metadata from file to APEv2 tag; normally
             used for embedded cuesheets and logs (field names “Cuesheet” and
             “Log”).

     --write-binary-tag “Field=@file.ext”
             Write the specified binary metadata file to APEv2 tag; normally
             used for cover art with the field name “Cover Art (Front)”.

     -x[n]   extra encode processing, n = 0 to 6, default=1; -x0 for no extra
             processing, -x1 to -x3 to choose best of predefined filters, -x4
             to -x6 to generate custom filters (very slow!)

     -y      yes to all warnings; use with caution!

     -z[n]   don't set (n=0 or omitted) or set (n=1) console title to indicate
             progress (leaves "WavPack Completed")
