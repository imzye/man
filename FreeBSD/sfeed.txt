SFEED(1)                FreeBSD General Commands Manual               SFEED(1)

NAME
     sfeed – RSS and Atom parser

SYNOPSIS
     sfeed [baseurl]

DESCRIPTION
     sfeed reads RSS or Atom feed data (XML) from stdin.  It writes the feed
     data in a TAB-separated format to stdout.  If the baseurl argument is a
     valid absolute URL then the relative links or enclosures will be made an
     absolute URL.

TAB-SEPARATED FORMAT FIELDS
     The items are output per line in a TAB-separated format.

     For the fields title, id and author each whitespace character is replaced
     by a SPACE character.  Control characters are removed.

     The content field can contain newlines and these are escaped.  TABs,
     newlines and '\' are escaped with '\', so it becomes: '\t', '\n' and
     '\\'.  Other whitespace characters except spaces are removed.  Control
     characters are removed.

     The order and content of the fields are:

     1. timestamp     UNIX timestamp in UTC+0, empty if missing or on a parse
                      failure.

     2. title         Title text, HTML code in titles is ignored and is
                      treated as plain-text.

     3. link          Link

     4. content       Content, can have plain-text or HTML code depending on
                      the content-type field.

     5. content-type  "html" or "plain" if it has content.

     6. id            RSS item GUID or Atom id.

     7. author        Item, first author.

     8. enclosure     Item, first enclosure.

     9. category      Item, categories, multiple values are separated by the
                      '|' character.

EXIT STATUS
     The sfeed utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
         curl -s 'https://codemadness.org/atom.xml' | sfeed

     To convert the character set from a feed that is not UTF-8 encoded the
     iconv(1) tool can be used:

         curl -s 'https://codemadness.org/some_iso-8859-1_feed.xml' | \
         iconv -f iso-8859-1 -t utf-8 | \
         sfeed

EXAMPLE SETUP
     1. Create a directory for the sfeedrc configuration and the feeds:

         mkdir -p ~/.sfeed/feeds

     2. Copy the example sfeedrc(5) configuration:

         cp sfeedrc.example ~/.sfeed/sfeedrc
         $EDITOR ~/.sfeed/sfeedrc

     Or import existing OPML subscriptions using sfeed_opml_import(1):

         sfeed_opml_import < file.opml > ~/.sfeed/sfeedrc

     3. To update feeds and merge the new items with existing items:

         sfeed_update

     4. Format feeds to a plain-text list:

         sfeed_plain ~/.sfeed/feeds/*

     Or format feeds to a curses interface:

         sfeed_curses ~/.sfeed/feeds/*

     There are also other formatting programs included.  The README file has
     more examples.

CAVEATS
     If a timezone for the timestamp field is not in the RFC 822 or RFC 3339
     format it is not supported and the timezone is interpreted as UTC+0.
