DESCRIPTION
       paho_c_pub sends data to an MQTT server using the Eclipse Paho C client
       asynchronous library (MQTTAsync).  MQTT is a protocol, operating over
       TCP/IP, which allows programs to easily communicate with each other
       through a server.  Messages are published to topics and delivered to
       any subscribers to those topics.  The corresponding subscriber program
       paho_c_sub allows the receipt of MQTT messages.

       The default mode of operation is to read input from stdin, sending a
       separate message for each line read.  Options exist to change this mode
       to send a one-off message, of 0 length (-n), a given string (-m), or
       the contents of a file (-f).


OPTIONS
       -t
       --topic
              The MQTT topic to publish the data to.

       -c
       --connection
              The MQTT URI to connect to, a combination of transport prefix,
              host, port and for websockets, topic.  To connect using TCP use
              the tcp prefix, for example: tcp://localhost:1883.  An example
              using SSL/TLS: ssl://localhost:1883.  An example for websockets,
              insecure: ws://localhost:1883/topic, and secure:
              wss://localhost:80/topic.

       -h
       --host The TCP/IP host name of the MQTT server to connect to. Along
              with the --port option, an older alternative to using
              --connection.

       -p
       --port The TCP/IP port number of the MQTT server to connect to. Along
              with the --host option, an older alternative to using
              --connection.

       -q
       --qos  The MQTT QoS on which to publish the message. The alternatives
              are 0, 1 or 2.

       -V
       --MQTTversion
              The version of the MQTT protocol to use.  Valid options are 31
              (or mqttv31), 311 (mqttv311) and 5 (or mqttv5).  If MQTT version
              5 is used, then some additional options are valid, such as
              --message-expiry and --user-property.

       --quiet
              Do not print error messages.

       --trace
              Print library internal trace.  Valid levels are min, max, error
              and rotocol.

       -r
       --retained
              Publish messages with the MQTT retained flag set.

       -n
       --null-message
              Publish a 0-length message.

       -m
       --message
              Publish a one off message with the payload supplied.

       -f
       --filename
              Publish a one off message with the contents of the file whose
              name is given.

       --message-expiry
              [MQTT version 5 only] Sets the expiry interval property of
              messages in seconds.

       --user-property
              [MQTT version 5 only] Sets a user property of sent messages.  A
              pair of strings, name and value.

       --will-topic
              Sets the MQTT will message topic to publish to. If the
              application ends without sending an MQTT disconnect, the will
              message will be published to this topic.

       --will-payload
              Only used if will-topic is set. Sets the MQTT will message to be
              published.

       --will-qos
              Only used if will-topic is set. Sets the MQTT QoS at which the
              will message is published. The alternatives are 0, 1 or 2.

       --will-retain
              Only used if will-topic is set. Sets the MQTT retained flag on
              the will message.

       --cafile
              Only used with a TLS connection. The name of a file for the
              OpenSSL trust store.

       --capath
              Only used with a TLS connection. The name of a directory holding
              OpenSSL trusted certificates.

       --cert Only used with a TLS connection. The name of a file for the TLS
              keystore containing a client certificate to be presented.

       --key  Only used with a TLS connection. The name of a file containing
              the client private key.

       --keypass
              Only used with a TLS connection. The password for the client
              private key file, if needed.

       --ciphers
              Only used with a TLS connection. A list of cipher suites that
              the client will present to the server during the TLS handshake.

       --insecure
              Only used with a TLS connection. Don't check that the server
              certificate common name matches the hostname.
