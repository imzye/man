NAME
       File::Binary - Binary file reading module

SYNOPSIS
           use File::Binary qw($BIG_ENDIAN $LITTLE_ENDIAN $NATIVE_ENDIAN);

           my $fb = File::Binary->new("myfile");

           $fb->get_ui8();
           $fb->get_ui16();
           $fb->get_ui32();
           $fb->get_si8();
           $fb->get_si16();
           $fb->get_si32();

           $fb->close();

           $fb->open(">newfile");

           $fb->put_ui8(255);
           $fb->put_ui16(65535);
           $fb->put_ui32(4294967295);
           $fb->put_si8(-127);
           $fb->put_si16(-32767);
           $fb->put_si32(-2147483645);

           $fb->close();


           $fb->open(IO::Scalar->new($somedata));
           $fb->set_endian($BIG_ENDIAN); # force endianness

           # do what they say on the tin
           $fb->seek($pos);
           $fb->tell();

           # etc etc

DESCRIPTION
       File::Binary is a Binary file reading module, hence the name, and was
       originally used to write a suite of modules for manipulating Macromedia
       SWF files.

       However it's grown beyond that and now actually, err, works.  And is
       generalised. And EVERYTHING! Yay!

       It has methods for reading and writing signed and unsigned 8, 16 and 32
       bit integers, at some point in the future I'll figure out a way of
       putting in methods for >32bit integers nicely but until then, patches
       welcome.

       It hasn't retained backwards compatability with the old version of this
       module for cleanliness sakes and also because the old interface was
       pretty braindead.

METHODS
   new
       Pass in either a file name or something which isa an IO::Handle.

   open
       Pass in either a file name or something which isa an IO::Handle.

       Will try and set binmode for the handle on if possible (i.e if the
       object has a "binmode" method) otherwise you should do it yourself.

   seek
       Seek to a position.

       Return our current position. If our file handle is not ISA IO::Seekable
       it will return 0 and, if $File::Binary::DEBUG is set to 1, there will
       be a warning.

       You can optionally pass a whence option in the same way as the builtin
       Perl seek() method. It defaults to "SEEK_SET".

       Returns the current file position.

   tell
       Return our current position. If our file handle is not ISA IO::Seekable
       then it will return 0 and, if $File::Binary::DEBUG is set to 1, there
       will be a warning.

   set_flush
       To flush or not to flush. That is the question

   set_endian
       Set the how the module reads files. The options are

           $BIG_ENDIAN
           $LITTLE_ENDIAN
           $NATIVE_ENDIAN

       NATIVE will deduce  the endianess of the current system.

   get_bytes
       Get an arbitary number of bytes from the file.

   put_bytes
       Write some bytes

   get_ui8 get_si8 put_ui8 put_si8
       read or write signed or unsigned 8 bit integers

   get_ui16 get_si16 put_ui16 put_si16
       read or write signed or unsigned 16 bit integers

   get_ui32 get_s32 put_ui32 put_si32
       read or write signed or unsigned 32 bit integers

   guess_endian
       Guess the endianness of this system. Returns either $LITTLE_ENDIAN or
       $BIG_ENDIAN

   close
       Close the file up. The File::Binary object will then be useless until
       you open up another file;

BUGS
       Can't do numbers greater than 32 bits.

       Can't extract Floating Point or Fixed Point numbers.

       Can't extract null terminated strings.

       Needs tests for seeking and telling.
