SNMP_HOSTRES(3)        FreeBSD Library Functions Manual        SNMP_HOSTRES(3)

NAME
     snmp_hostres – host resources module for bsnmpd(8)

LIBRARY
     (begemotSnmpdModulePath."hostres" = /usr/lib/snmp_hostres.so)

DESCRIPTION
     The snmp_hostres module implements the HOST-RESOURCES-MIB as standardized
     in RFC 2790.

RESTRICTIONS
     Not all information in the MIB is meaningful in FreeBSD or is available.
     The following variables are not implemented or carry no information:

     hrFSType
             There are several types of file systems for which no appropriate
             OID exists yet which are supported by FreeBSD.  For smbfs, procfs
             and devfs , hrFSOther is returned.  In all other cases,
             hrFSUnknown.

     hrFSBootable
             It is questionable what bootable means here.  Does it mean that
             the BIOS is available to start a boot on that file system or does
             it mean that there is something bootable?  In either case this
             information is not available so this variable returns True for
             the root file system (which is not necessarily correct) and False
             for all others.

     hrFSLastFullBackupDate, hrFSLastPartialBackupDate
             This is not available and always returns an empty string.
             Theoretically, this could be retrieved from /etc/dumpdates, which
             would hardly be correct given the different ways of doing
             backups.

     hrDiskStorageTable
             Floppy devices are currently not reported.  Also the names of the
             disks are hard-coded in the module.
