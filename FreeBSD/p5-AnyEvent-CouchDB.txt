NAME
       couchdb-push - Push documents from the filesystem to CouchDB

SYNOPSIS
       Usage:

         couchdb-push [OPTION]... <FILE>... <COUCHDB_DATABASE>

       Pushing a directory of JSON documents to http://localhost:5984/mydb :

         couchdb-push * http://localhost:5984/mydb
         couchdb-push * mydb                         # same as above

         # Note that the filenames will be used as document ids

       Pushing one design document to mydb:

         # The file "_design/comments" must exist in the filesystem.
         couchdb-push _design/comments mydb

       Overwrite existing documents when pushing to mydb:

         couchdb-push --force * mydb

DESCRIPTION
       This script will take a list of JSON-encoded files and publish them to
       a CouchDB database.  The paths of the filenames will be used as
       document ids in CouchDB, and slashes in the path will be escaped
       properly.  This will let you upload documents that have ids with '/'s
       in them (like '_design/docs').
