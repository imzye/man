NAME
       HOP::Stream - "Higher Order Perl" streams

VERSION
       Version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
       This package is based on the Stream.pm code from the book "Higher Order
       Perl", by Mark Jason Dominus.

       A stream is conceptually similar to a linked list. However, we may have
       an infinite stream. As infinite amounts of data are frequently taxing
       to the memory of most systems, the tail of the list may be a promise. A
       promise, in this context, is merely a promise that the code will
       compute the rest of the list if necessary. Thus, the rest of the list
       does not exist until actually needed.

       The documentation here is not complete.  See "Higher Order Perl" by
       Mark Dominus for a full explanation.  Further, this is ALPHA code.
       Patches and suggestions welcome.

FUNCTIONS
   node
        my $node = node( $head, $tail );

       Returns a node for a stream.

       The tail of the node may be a promise to compute the actual tail when
       needed.

   head
         my $head = head( $node );

       This function returns the head of a stream.

   tail
        my $tail = tail( $stream );

       Returns the tail of a stream.

   is_node
         if ( is_node($tail) ) {
            ...
         }

       Returns true if the tail of a node is a node. Generally this function
       is used internally.

   is_promise
         if ( is_promise($tail) ) {
            ...
         }

       Returns true if the tail of a node is a promise. Generally this
       function is used internally.

   promise
         my $promise = promise { ... };

       A utility function with a code prototype ("sub promise(&);") allowing
       one to specify a coderef with curly braces and omit the "sub" keyword.

   show
        show( $stream, [ $number_of_nodes ] );

       This is a debugging function that will return a text representation of
       $number_of_nodes of the stream $stream.

       Omitting the second argument will print all elements of the stream.
       This is not recommended for infinite streams (duh).

       The elements of the stream will be separated by the current value of
       $".

   drop
         my $head = drop( $stream );

       This is the "shift" function for streams. It returns the head of the
       stream and and modifies the stream in-place to be the tail of the
       stream.

   transform
         my $new_stream = transform { $_[0] * 2 } $old_stream;

       This is the "map" function for streams. It returns a new stream.

   filter
         my $new_stream = filter { $_[0] % 2 } $old_stream;

       This is the "grep" function for streams. It returns a new stream.

   merge
         my $merged_stream = merge( $stream1, $stream2 );

       This function takes two streams assumed to be in sorted order and
       merges them into a new stream, also in sorted order.

   append
         my $merged_stream = append( $stream1, $stream2 );

       This function takes a list of streams and attaches them together head-
       to-tail into a new stream.

   list_to_stream
         my $stream = list_to_stream(@list);

       Converts a list into a stream.  The final item of "list" should be a
       promise or another stream.  Thus, to generate the numbers one through
       ten, one could do this:

        my $stream = list_to_stream( 1 .. 9, node(10, undef) );
        # or
        my $stream = list_to_stream( 1 .. 9, node(10) );

   iterator_to_stream
         my $stream = iterator_to_stream($iterator);

       Converts an iterator into a stream.  An iterator is merely a code
       reference which, when called, keeps returning elements until there are
       no more elements, at which point it returns "undef".

   upto
         my $stream = upto($from_num, $to_num);

       Given two numbers, $from_num and $to_num, returns an iterator which
       will return all of the numbers between $from_num and $to_num,
       inclusive.

   upfrom
         my $stream = upfrom($num);

       Similar to "upto", this function returns a stream which will generate
       an infinite list of numbers starting from $num.
