MATE-SESSION-INHIB(1)            User Commands           MATE-SESSION-INHIB(1)

NAME
       mate-session-inhibit - inhibit mate-session functionality

SYNOPSIS
       mate-session-inhibit [OPTION...] {COMMAND}

DESCRIPTION
       mate-session-inhibit can inhibit certain mate-session functionality
       while executing the given COMMAND. To achieve this, it calls the
       Inhibit() method of the mate-session D-Bus API and creates an
       inhibitor. The inhibitor is automatically removed when
       mate-session-inhibit exits.

       A typical use case is to prevent the session from going idle (and thus
       locking the screen) while a movie player is running.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           print help and exit

       --version
           print version information and exit

       --app-id ID
           The application id to use when calling the mate-session Inhibit()
           method. If this option is not specified, "unknown" is used.

       --reason REASON
           A human-readable reason to pass along when calling the mate-session
           Inhibit() method. If this option is not specified, "not specified"
           is used.

       --inhibit ARG
           ARG specifies the things to inhibit, as a colon-separated list. The
           possible values are logout, switch-user, suspend, idle, automount.
           If this option is used more than once, the values are combined. If
           this option is not specified, "idle" is assumed.
