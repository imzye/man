DESCRIPTION
       Leges Motus is a networked, team-based, 2D shooter set in zero-gravity.
       Using only the force from jumping off of walls and the recoil from
       their guns, players must travel across the arena to lower their
       opponent's gate.

GAMEPLAY
       The objective of the game is to reach the opposing team's gate and stay
       next to it until it opens fully.

       Shoot enemy players to freeze them. They will un-freeze a number of
       seconds after they are frozen.

       You can move by jumping off of any obstacle, and you will jump in the
       direction of the mouse pointer. You will also move due to the recoil
       from firing your gun. When frozen, you will bounce off of obstacles. If
       you unfreeze away from obstacles, shoot your weapon to move back
       towards the nearest obstacle.
