UCPP(1)                 FreeBSD General Commands Manual                UCPP(1)

NAME
       ucpp - C preprocessor

SYNOPSIS
       ucpp [ options ] [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
       ucpp is a C preprocessor mostly compatible with ISO-C99.  It is rather
       strict and uses only a small amount of memory. It uses standard input
       as primary input if no file argument is given.

OPTIONS
       There are several classes of options.

       Language Options

       -C     keep comments in the output.

       -s     if a rogue '#' is encountered, do not emit an error and keep it
              in the output.

       -l     supress the emission of '#line' directives in the output.

       -lg    convert the '#line' to the gcc-style equivalent.

       -CC    disable C++-like comments (a '//' begins a comment, up to the
              end of the line). Use this option to get closer to C90
              behaviour.

       -a, -na
              handle assertions (defined with #assert); -a also defines the
              standard assertions #machine , #cpu and #system (see -e to get
              the local definition of such assertions).

       -a0    disable assertion support.

       -V     disable support for macros with a variable number of arguments:
              in C99, a macro may be declared with ...  as the last argument;
              inside the replacement list, __VA_ARGS__ is replaced with the
              optional extra arguments given in the call to the macro.  Use
              this option to get closer to C90 behaviour.

       -u     enable UTF-8 support: with this option, the source is considered
              as an ISO/10646 source, encoded in UTF-8. Characters represented
              as two bytes or more are considered as alphabetic characters,
              like letters, and therefore usable in identifiers. These
              characters hold the same syntactic value than the corresponding
              Universal Character Names.

       -X     enable -a, -u and -Y.  This should make ucpp behave closer to
              what is requested from a "modern" C preprocessor.

       -c90   enable -V and -CC, and do not define __STDC_VERSION__.  This
              should make ucpp mimic older C90 behaviour.

       -t     disable trigraph support; this seems to be required for some
              legacy code.

       Warning Options

       -wt    emit a final warning when trigraphs are encountered.

       -wtt   emit warnings for each trigraph encountered.

       -wa    emit annoying warnings (these are usually useless).

       -w0    supress standard warnings.

       Directory Options

       -Idirectory

       -I directory
              add directory to the include path, before the standard include
              path.

       -Jdirectory

       -J directory
              add directory to the include path, after the standard include
              path.

       -zI    do not use the standard (compile-time) include path.

       -M     emit only the names of encountered files, separated by spaces;
              this is intended for automatic generation of Makefile
              dependencies.

       -Ma    do the same as -M but also for system files.

       -o file
              direct the ouput to file instead of standard output.

       Macro Options

       -Dmacro
              predefine macro with content 1.

       -Dmacro=def
              predefine macro with the content def.

       -Umacro
              undefine macro.

       -Y     predefine system-dependant macros.

       -Z     do not predefine special macros such as __TIME__.

       -Afoo(bar)
              add foo(bar) to the list of assertions.

       -Bfoo(bar)
              remove foo(bar) of the list of assertions; you may also use
              -Bfoo to remove all -Bfoo(xxx) from the list of assertions.

       -d     instead of normal output, emit '#define' directives representing
              all macros defined during processing.

       -e     instead of normal output, emit '#assert' directives representing
              all assertions defined during processing.

       Miscellaneous Options

       -v     print version number, include path and (optionaly) defined
              assertions.

       -h     print some help.

ENVIRONMENT
       ucpp is not itself affected by environment variables. However, it uses
       library functions that might be affected, depending on the system.

BUGS
       ucpp is considered stable software. However improbable it is, please
       report bugs to the author (possibly with a file that exhibits the
       problem) if the latest version, available from this site:

       http://pornin.nerim.net/ucpp/

       has the bug.
