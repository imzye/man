DEVICE_ATTACH(9)       FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual      DEVICE_ATTACH(9)

NAME
     DEVICE_ATTACH – attach a device

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <sys/bus.h>

     int
     DEVICE_ATTACH(device_t dev);

DESCRIPTION
     Attach a device to the system after the DEVICE_PROBE() method has been
     called and has indicated that the device exists.  The DEVICE_ATTACH()
     method should initialize the hardware and allocate other system resources
     (such as devfs(5) entries).

     Devices which implement buses should use this method to probe for the
     existence of devices attached to the bus and add them as children.  If
     this is combined with the use of bus_generic_attach(9) the child devices
     will be automatically probed and attached.

RETURN VALUES
     Zero is returned on success, otherwise an appropriate error is returned.
