NAME
       aoxsuper.conf - configuration file for Archiveopteryx.

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/local/etc/archiveopteryx/aoxsuper.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The aoxsuper.conf file contains a few configuration settings for
       Archiveopteryx. It is read by aox(8) at startup. Syntax errors, unknown
       variables, and other errors are logged on stderr.

       aoxsuper.conf is usually created at installation time, by running
       /usr/local/libexec/aox/installer.

       There is only one required variable, namely db-owner-password.

SECURITY NOTE
       Anyone who can read aoxsuper.conf can see the database owner password,
       and use this password to read all mail, or even to damage or destroy
       the mail database.

       By default, aoxsuper.conf is readable only by root.

SETTINGS
       The format is as for archiveopteryx.conf(5):

              name = value # comment

       All variables in archiveopteryx.conf(5) may be overridden in
       aoxsuper.conf, if it is necessary that aox(8) sees a different value
       than the servers see.

   Database Access
       db-owner
              The name of the Postgres user that owns the database and is used
              to perform privileged operations (such as deleting mail). The
              default is aoxsuper.

       db-owner-password
              The database password used for the db-owner.  The default is an
              empty string.

              Unless a password is specified, the Archiveopteryx installer
              sets up a randomly-chosen password and writes it to the
              configuration file.
