NAME
       TeX::Hyphen -- hyphenate words using TeX's patterns

SYNOPSIS
               use TeX::Hyphen;
               my $hyp = new TeX::Hyphen 'file' => 'hyphen.tex',
                       'style' => 'czech', leftmin => 2,
                       rightmin => 2;

               my $hyp = new TeX::Hyphen 'file' => 'hyphen.tex',
                       'style' => 'utf8';

               # my $hyp = new TeX::Hyphen "hyphen.tex";

               my $word = "representation";
               my @points = $hyp->hyphenate($word);
               print $hyp->visualize($word), "\n";

DESCRIPTION
       Constructor new() creates a new Hyphen object and loads the file with
       patterns into memory. Then you can ask it for hyphenation of a word by
       calling a method of this object. If no file is specified, the default
       Donald E. Knuth's hyphen.tex, that is included in this module, is used
       instead.

   Arguments to constructor
       You can pass arguments to the new() call as hash, possible options are

       file
           Name of the file with the patters. It will be loaded and the
           resulting object will be able to hyphenate according to patterns in
           that file.

           For convenience and backward compatibility, the file name can also
           be specified as the first (odd) parameter to new().

       style
           Various languages use special shortcuts to specify the patterns.
           Instead of doing the full TeX expansion, we use Perl code to parse
           the patterns. The style option loads TeX::Hyphen::name_of_the_style
           module and uses the parsing functions found in it.

           Currently, the default czech (which also works for English
           alright), german, and utf8 are available. See the
           TeX::Hyphen::czech man page for more information, especially if you
           want to support other languages/styles.

       leftmin
           The minimum starting substring which will not be hyphenated. This
           overrides the default specified in the style file.

       rightmin
           The minimum ending substring which will not be hyphenated. This
           overrides the default specified in the style file.

   Methods that are supported
       Method hyphenate() returns list of places where the word can be
       divided, so

               $hyp->hyphenate('representation')

       returns list (3, 5, 8, 10).

       Method visualize() can be used to show these points, so

               $hyp->visualize('representation')

       should return "rep-re-sen-ta-tion", at least for English patterns.

       Variables $TeX::Hyphen::LEFTMIN and $TeX::Hyphen::RIGHTMIN can be used
       to restrict minimal starting and ending substring where it is not
       possible to hyphenate. They both default to 2 but should be changed to
       match the paratemers used to generate the patterns.

       Variable $TeX::Hyphen::DEBUG can be set to see some statistics and
       processing.

       The file with hyphenation patterns may contain "\'" and "\v" accents,
       used in the Czech (and other) languages.
