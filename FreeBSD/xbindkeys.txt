XBindKeys(1)            FreeBSD General Commands Manual           XBindKeys(1)

NAME
       xbindkeys - a grabbing keys program for X

SYNOPSIS
       xbindkeys [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       XbindKeys is a program that grabs key and mouse button events in X and
       starts associated shell commands.


COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
       Available command line options are as follows:

       -d, --defaults
              Print a default rc file

       -f, --file
              Use an alternative rc file

       -h, --help
              Short help on options plus version/author info.

       -X, --display
              Set X display to use

       -v, --verbose
              More information on xbindkeys when it runs


       -k, --key
              Identify one key pressed (useful for configuration)


       -mk, --multikey
              Identify multi key pressed (useful for configuration)


       -g, --geometry
              size and position of window with -k|-mk option


       -n, --nodaemon
              don't start as daemon


       If guile support has not been disabled:

       -dg, --defaults-guile
              Print a default guile configuration file


       -fg, --file-guile
              Use an alternative guile configuration file


XBINDKEYSRC
       XBindKeys default configuration file is at $HOME/.xbindkeysrc, used
       only for one user.

       The configuration file consists of commands in double quotes, and
       associated keys in the next line.

       Comments are started with a pound (#) and extend to the end of the
       line.

       You can see a default configuration with --defaults



KEYSYMS
       The program expects combinations of keysyms to be used by using plus
       (+) characters to combine them together.

       The format of a command line is:
           "command to start &"
              associated key

       To specify an associated key, you can use `xbindkeys --key` or
        `xbindkeys --multikey` and put one of the two lines in the
       configuration file.

       A list of keys is in /usr/include/X11/keysym.h and in
       /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h.  The XK_ is not needed.

       List of modifiers:
           Release, Control, Shift, Mod1 (Alt), Mod2 (NumLock),
           Mod3 (CapsLock), Mod4, Mod5 (Scroll).

       The release modifier is not a standard X modifier, but you can use it
       if you want to catch release events instead of press events.  Modifiers
       are not case sensitive.

       By defaults, xbindkeys does not pay attention to the modifiers NumLock,
       CapsLock and ScrollLock.  Add the lines below in the configuration file
       if you want to pay attention to them.

           keystate_numlock = enable
           keystate_capslock = enable
           keystate_scrolllock= enable


EXAMPLES
       # control+shift+q starts xterm
       "xterm"
         control+shift + q

       # Menu key starts xbindkeys_show
       "xbindkeys_show"
         Menu

       # Control + mouse button 1 starts xterm
       "xterm"
         Control + b:1

       # Control+Shift+a  release event starts rxvt
       "rxvt"
         release+control+shift + a

       # Control + mouse button 2 release event starts rxvt
       "rxvt"
         Control + b:2 + Release


SCHEME CONFIGURATION STYLE
       A scheme configuration can be used if guile support has not been
       disabled.  The standard configuration is loaded only if the scheme
       configuration is not available.

       For more details, please see here
         http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html

       Note: The guile configuration file is prefered for non trivial
       configurations, for example double click, timed click or key combinations.

       The default location is ~/.xbindkeysrc.scm

       Use xbindkeys --defaults-guile for more details.

       And xbindkeys --defaults-guile > ~/.xbindkeysrc.scm to use this method.


NOTE
       xbindkeys reloads the configuration file if modified.  Send a HUP
       signal to force reloading:

       killall -HUP xbindkeys

       When a HUP signal is sent to xbindkeys, changes take effect only after
       moving the mouse.
