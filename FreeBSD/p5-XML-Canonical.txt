NAME
       XML::Canonical - Perl Implementation of Canonical XML

SYNOPSIS
         use XML::Canonical;
         $canon = XML::Canonical->new(comments => 1);
         $canon_xml = $canon->canonicalize_string($xml_string);
         $canon_xml = $canon->canonicalize_document($xmlgdome_document);

         my @nodes = $doc->findnodes(qq{(//*[local-name()='included'] | //@*)});
         my $canon_output = $canon->canonicalize_nodes($doc, \@nodes);

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides an implementation of Canonical XML Recommendation
       (Version 1, 15 March 2001).  It uses XML::GDOME for its DOM tree and
       XPath nodes.

       It provides a XS wrapper around libxml2's Canonical XML code.

METHODS
       $canon = XML::Canonical->new( comments => $comments );
           Returns a new XML::Canonical object.  If $comments is 1, then the
           canonical output will include comments, otherwise comments will be
           removed from the output.

       $output = $canon->canonicalize_string( $xml_string );
           Reads in an XML string and outputs its canonical form.

       $output = $canon->canonicalize_document( $libxml_doc, $xpath_res );
           Reads in a XML::LibXML::Document object and returns its canonical
           form.

           The optional $xpath_res specifics a set of visible nodes in terms
           of a XPath query result.

TODO
       Support for XML Signature and upcoming XML Encryption.  Probably as an
       XS wrapper to XMLSec Library, see http://www.aleksey.com/xmlsec/

       Support XML::LibXML as well as XML::GDOME.

NOTES
       This module is in early alpha stage.  It is suggested that you look
       over the source code and test cases before using the module.  In
       addition, the API is subject to change.

       This module implements the lastest w3 recommendation, located at
       http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315

       Comments, suggestions, and patches welcome.
