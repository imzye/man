DESCRIPTION
       This manual page describes how to use pavuk. Pavuk can be used to
       mirror contents of internet/intranet servers and to maintain copies in
       a local tree of documents.  Pavuk stores retrieved documents in locally
       mapped disk space. The structure of the local tree is the same as the
       one on the remote server. Each supported service (protocol) has its own
       subdirectory in the local tree.  Each referenced server has its own
       subdirectory in these protocols subdirectories; followed by the port
       number on which the service resides, delimited by character can be be
       changed. With the option -fnrules you can change the default layout of
       the local document tree, without losing link consistency.
       With pavuk it is possible to have up-to-date copies of remote documents
       in the local disk space.
       As of version 0.3pl2, pavuk can automatically restart broken
       connections, and reget partial content from an FTP server (which must
       support the REST command), from a properly configured HTTP/1.1 server,
       or from a HTTP/1.0 server which supports Ranges.
       As of version 0.6 it is possible to handle configurations via so called
       scenarios.  The best way to create such a configuration file is to use
       the X Window interface and simply save the created configuration. The
       other way is to use the -dumpscn switch.
       As of version 0.7pl1 it is possible to store authentification
       information into an authinfo file, which pavuk can then parse and use.
       As of version 0.8pl4 pavuk can fetch documents for use in a local
       proxy/cache server without storing them to local documents tree.
       As of version 0.9pl4 pavuk supports SOCKS (4/5) proxies if you have the
       required libraries.
       As of version 0.9pl12 pavuk can preserve permissions of remote files
       and symbolic links, so it can be used for powerful FTP mirroring.
       Pavuk supports SSL connections to FTP servers, if you specify ftps://
       URL instead of ftp://.
       Pavuk can automatically handle file names with unsafe characters for
       filesystem.  This is yet implemented only for Win32 platform and it is
       hard coded.
       Pavuk can now use HTTP/1.1 protocol for communication with HTTP
       servers.  It can use persistent connections, so one TCP connection
       should be used to transfer several documents without closing it. This
       feature saves network bandwidth and also speedup network communication.
       Pavuk can do configurable POST requests to HTTP servers and support
       also file uploading via HTTP POST request.
       Pavuk can automatically fill found HTML forms, if user will supply data
       for its fields before with option -formdata.
       Pavuk can run configurable number of concurrently running downloading
       threads when compiled with multithreading support.

       to
       ftp/host_port/[path]

       FTPS
       ftps://[[user][:password]@]host[:port][/path]
       to
       ftps/host_port/[path]

       Gopher
       gopher://host[:port][/type[document]]
       to
       gopher/host_port/[type[document]]

       NOTE: Pavuk will use the string with which it queries the target server
       as the name of the results file. This file name may, in some cases,
       contain punctuations such as $,?,=,& etc. Such punctuation can cause
       problems when you are trying to browse downloaded files with your
       browser or you are trying to process downloaded files with shell
       scripts or view files with file management utilities which reference
       the name of the results file.  If you believe that this maybe causing
       problems for you, then you can remove all punctuation from the result
       file name with the option: -tr_del_chr [:punct:] or with other options
       for adjusting filenames.

Mode
       -mode {normal, linkupdate, sync, singlepage, singlereget, resumeregets}
              Set operation mode.
              normal - retrieves recursive documents
              linkupdate - update remote URLs in local HTML documents to local
              URLs if these URLs exist in the local tree
              sync - synchronize remote documents with local tree (if a local
              copy of a document is older than remote, the document is
              retrieved again, otherwise nothing happens)
              singlepage - URL is retrieved as one page with all inline
              objects (picture, sound ...) this mode is now obsoleted by
              -singlepage option.
              resumeregets - pavuk scans the local tree for files that were
              not retrieved fully and retrieves them again (uses partial get
              if possible)
              singlereget - get URL until it is retrieved in full
              dontstore - transfer page from server, but don't store it to the
              local tree.  This mode is suitable for fetching pages that are
              held in a local proxy/cache server.
              reminder - used to inform the user about changed documents
              ftpdir - used to list of contents of FTP directories

              default operation mode is normal mode.

              log file. (default is this option turned off)

       -slogfile $file
              File to store short logs in. This file contains one line of
              informations per processed document.  This is meant to be used
              in connection with any sort of script to produce some
              statistics, for validating links on your website, or for
              generating simple sitemaps.  Multiple pavuk processes can use
              this file concurrently, without overwriting each others entries.

              - URL of the document
              - PARENTURL first parent document of this URL
                (when it doesn't have parent - [none])
              - FILENAME is the name of the local file the
                document is saved under

              - DOWNLOAD_TIME time which takes downloading of this
                document in format seconds.mili_seconds
              - HTTPRESP contains the first line of the HTTP server
                response

       -language $str
              Native language that pavuk should use for communication with its
              user (works only when there is a message catalog for that
              language) GNU gettext support (for message internationalization)
              must also be compiled in. Default language is taken from your
              NLS environment variables.

       -gui_font $font
              Font used in the GUI interface. To list available X fonts use
              the xlsfonts command.  This option is available only when
              compiled with GTK+ GUI support.


Netli options
       -[no]read_css
              Enable or disable fetching objects mentioned in style sheets.

       -[no]verify
              Enable or disable verifying server CERTS in SSL mode.


       -tlogfile $file
              Turn on Netli logging with output to specified file.


       -trelative {object | program}
              Make Netli timings relative to the start of the first object or
              the program.


       -transparent_proxy FQDN[:port]
              When processing URL, send the original, but send it to the IP
              address at FQDN


       -transparent_ssl_proxy FQDN[:port]
              When processing HTTPS URL, send the original, but send it to the
              IP address at FQDN


       -sdemo Output in sdemo compatible format. This is only used by sdemo.
              (For now it simply means output '-1' rather than '*'  when
              measurements are invalid.)


       -noencode
              Do not escape characters that are "unsafe" in URLS.


Special start
       -X     Start program with X Window interface (if compiled with support
              for GTK+).  Pavuk as default starts without GUI, and behaves as
              regular commandline tool.

       -runX  When used together with the -X option, pavuk starts processing
              of URLs immediately after the GUI window is launched. Without
              the -X given, this option doesn't have any effect.  Only
              available when compiled with GTK+ support .

       -bg/-nobg
              This option allows pavuk to detach from its terminal and run in
              background mode.  Pavuk will not output any messages to the
              terminal than. If you want to see messages, you have to use the
              -log_file option to specify a file where messages will be
              written.  Default pavuk executes at foreground.

       -check_bg/-nocheck_bg
              Normally, programs sent into the background after being run in
              foreground continue to output messages to the terminal.  If this
              option is activated, pavuk checks if it is running as background
              job and will not write any messages to the terminal in this
              case. After it becomes a foreground job again, it will start
              writing messages to terminal in the normal way.  This option is
              available only when your system supports retrieving of terminal
              info via tc*() functions.

       -prefs/-noprefs
              When you turn this option on, pavuk will preserve all settings
              when exiting, and when you run pavuk with GUI interface again,
              all settings will be restored.  The settings will be stored in
              the ~./pavuk_prefs file. Default pavuk want restore its option
              when started.  This option is available only when compiled with
              GTK+.

       -schedule $time
              Execute pavuk at the time specified as parameter. The Format of
              the $time parameter is YYYY.MM.DD.hh.mm.  You need a properly
              configured scheduling with the at command on your system for
              using this option.  If default configuration (at -f %f %t
              %d.%m.%Y) of scheduling command won't work on your system, try
              to adjust it with -sched_cmd option.

       -reschedule $nr
              Execute pavuk periodically with $nr hours period.  You need
              properly configured scheduling with the at command on your
              system for using this option.

       -sched_cmd $str
              Command to use for scheduling. Pavuk explicitly supports
              scheduling with at $str should contain regular characters and
              macros, escaped by % character.  Supported macros are:
                 %f
                  - for script filename
                 %t
                  - for time (in format HH:MM)
                  - all macros as supported by the strftime() function

       -urls_file $file
              If you use this option, pavuk will read URLs from $file before
              it starts processing.  In this file, each URL needs to be on a
              separate line. After the last URL, a single dot . followed by a
              LF (line-feed) character denotes the end.  Pavuk will start
              processing right after all URLs have been read.  If $file is
              given as the - character, standard input will be read.

       -store_info/-nostore_info
              This option causes pavuk to store information about each
              document into a separate file in the .pavuk_info directory. This
              file is used to store the original URL from which the document
              was downloaded. For files that are downloaded via HTTP or HTTPS
              protocols, the whole HTTP response header is stored there. I
              recommend to use this option when you are using options that
              change the default layout of the local document tree, because
              this info file helps pavuk to map the local filename to the URL.
              This option is also very useful when different URLs have the
              same filename in the local tree. When this occurs, pavuk detects
              this using info files, and it will prefix the local name with
              numbers. At default is disabled storing of this extra
              informations.

       -info_dir $dir
              You can set with this option location of separate directory for
              storing info files created when -store_info option is used. This
              is useful when you don't want to mix in destination directory
              the info files with regular document files. The structure of the
              info files is preserved, just are stored in different directory.

       -request $req
              With this option you can specify extended informations for
              starting URLs.  With this option you can specify query data for
              POST or GET .  Current syntax of this option is : URL:["]$url["]
              [METHOD:["]{GET|POST}["]] [ENCODING:["]{u|m}["]]
              [FIELD:["]variable=value["]] [FILE:["]variable=filename["]
              [LNAME:["]local_filename["]]

              - URL: specifies request URL
              - METHOD: specifies request method for URL and is
                one of GET or POST.
              - ENCODING: specifies encoding for request body data.
                  m is for multipart/form-data encoding
                  u is for application/x-www-form-urlencoded
                  encoding
              - FIELD: specifies field of request data in format
                  variable=value. For encoding of special characters
                  in variable and value you can use same encoding
                  as is used in application/x-www-form-urlencoded
                  encoding.
              - FILE: specifies special field of query, which is
                  used to specify file for POST based file upload.
              - LNAME: specifies localname for this request
       When you need to use inside the FIELD: and FILE: fields of request
       specification special characters, you should use the application/x-www-
       form-urlencoded encoding of characters. It means all nonASCII
       characters, quote character ("), space character ( ), ampersand
       character (&), percent character (%) and equal character (=) should be
       encoded in form %xx where xx is hexadecimal representation of ASCII
       value of character. So for example % character should be encoded like
       %25.

       -formdata $req
              This option gives you chance to specify contents for HTML forms
              found during traversing document tree.
               Current syntax of this option is same as for -request option,
              but ENCODING: and METHOD: are meaningless in this option
              semantics.
               In URL: you have to specify HTML form action URL, which will be
              matched against action URLs found in processed HTML documents.
              If pavuk finds action URL which matches that supplied in
              -formdata option, pavuk will construct GET or POST request from
              data supplied in this option and from default form field values
              supplied in HTML document. Values supplied on commandline have
              precedence before that supplied in HTML file.

       -nthreads $nr
              By means of this option you can specify how many concurrent
              threads will download documents. Default pavuk executes 3
              concurrent downloading threads.  This option is available only
              when pavuk is compiled to support multithreading.

       -immesg/-noimmesg
              Default pavuks behavior when running multiple downloading
              threads is to buffer all output messages in memory buffer and
              flush that buffered data just when thread finishes processing of
              one document. With this option you can change this behavior to
              see the messages immediately when it is produced. It is only
              usable when you want to debug some specials in multithreading
              environment.  This option is available only when pavuk is
              compiled to support multithreading.

       -dumpfd $nr
              For scripting is sometimes usable to be able to download
              document directly to pipe or variable instead of storing it to
              regular file. In such case you can use this option to dump data
              for example to stdout ($nr = 1).

       -dump_after/-nodump_after
              While using -dumpfd option in multithreaded pavuk, it is
              required to dump document in one moment because documents
              downloaded in multiple threads can overlap. This option is also
              useful when you want to dump document after pavuk adjusts links
              inside HTML documents.

       -dump_response/-nodump_response
              This option have effect only when used with -dumpfd option. It
              is used to dump HTTP response headers.

       -dump_urlfd $nr
              When you will use this option, pavuk will output all URLs found
              in HTML documents to file descriptor $nr. You can use this
              option to extract and convert all URLs to absolute.


Scenario/Task options
       -scenario $str
              Name of scenario to load and/or run. Scenarios are files with a
              structure similar to the .pavukrc file.  Scenarios contain saved
              configurations. You can use it for periodical mirroring.
              Parameters from scenarios specified at the command line can be
              overwritten by command line parameters.  To be able to use this
              option, you need to specify scenario base directory with option
              -scndir.

       -dumpscn $filename
              Store actual configuration into scenario file with name
              $filename.  This is useful to quickly create pre-configured
              scenarios for manual editing.


Directory options
       -msgcat $dir
              Directory which contains the message catalog for pavuk.  If you
              do not have permission to store a pavuk message catalog in the
              system directory, you should simply create similar structure of
              directories in your home directory as it is on your system.

              For example:

              Your native language is German, and your home directory is
              /home/jano.

              You should at first create the directory
              /home/jano/locales/de/LC_MESSAGES/, then put the German pavuk.mo
              there and set -msgcat to /home/jano/locales/.  If you have
              properly set locale environment values, you will see pavuk
              speaking German.  This option is available only when you
              compiled in support for GNU gettext messages
              internationalization.

       -cdir $dir
              Directory where are all retrieved documents are stored. If not
              specified, the current directory is used. If the specified
              directory doesn't exist, it will be created.

       -scndir $dir
              Directory in which your scenarios are stored.  You must use this
              option when you are loading or storing scenario files.


Preserve options
       -preserve_time/-nopreserve_time
              Store downloaded document with same modification time as on the
              remote site. Modification time will be set only when such
              information is available (some FTP servers do not support the
              MDTM command, and some documents on HTTP servers are created
              online so pavuk can't retrieve the modification time of this
              document).  At default modification time of documents isn't
              preserved.

       -preserve_perm/-nopreserve_perm
              Store downloaded document with the same permissions as on the
              remote site.  This option has effect only when downloading a
              file through FTP protocol and assumes that the -ftplist option
              is used. At default permissions are not preserved.

       -preserve_slinks/-nopreserve_slinks
              Set symbolic links to point exactly to same location as on the
              remote server; don't do any relocations.  This option has effect
              only when downloading file through FTP protocol and assumes that
              the -ftplist option is used.  Default symbolic links are not
              preserved, and are retrieved as regular documents with full
              contents of linked file.

              For example, assume that on the FTP server ftp.xx.org there is a
              symbolic link /pub/pavuk/pavuk-current.tgz, which points to
              /tmp/pub/pavuk-0.9pl11.tgz.  Pavuk will create symbolic link
              ftp/ftp.xx.org_21/pub/pavuk/pavuk-current.tgz
              if option -preserve_slinks will be used this symbolic link will
              point to /tmp/pub/pavuk-0.9pl11.tgz
              if option -preserve_slinks want be used, this symbolic link will
              point to
               ../../tmp/pub/pavuk-0.9pl11.tgz

       -retrieve_symlink/-noretrieve_symlink
              Retrieve files behind symbolic links instead of replicating
              symlinks in local tree.


Proxy options
       -http_proxy $site[:$port]
              If this parameter is used, then all HTTP requests are going
              through this proxy server. This is useful if your site resides
              behind a firewall, or if you want to use a HTTP proxy cache
              server. The default port number is 8080.  Pavuk allows you to
              specify multiple HTTP proxies (using multiple -http_proxy
              options) and it will rotate proxies with roundrobin priority
              disabling proxies with errors.

       -nocache/-cache
              Use this option whenever you want to get the document directly
              from the site and not from your HTTP proxy cache server. Default
              pavuk allows transfer of document copies from cache.

       -ftp_proxy $site[:$port]
              If this parameter is used, then all FTP requests are going
              through this proxy server.  This is useful when your site
              resides behind a firewall, or if you want to use FTP proxy cache
              server.  The default port number is 22.  Pavuk supports three
              different types of proxies for FTP, see the options -ftp_httpgw,
              -ftp_dirtyproxy. If none of the mentioned options is used, then
              pavuk assumes a regular FTP proxy with USER user@host connecting
              to remote FTP server.

       -ftp_httpgw/-noftp_httpgw
              The specified FTP proxy is a HTTP gateway for the FTP protocol.
              Default FTP proxy is regular FTP proxy.

       -ftp_dirtyproxy/-noftp_dirtyproxy
              The specified FTP proxy is a HTTP proxy which supports a CONNECT
              request (pavuk should use full FTP protocol, except of active
              data connections).  Default FTP proxy is regular FTP proxy.  If
              both -ftp_dirtyproxy and -ftp_httpgw are specified,
              -ftp_dirtyproxy is preferred.

       -gopher_proxy $site[:$port]
              Gopher gateway or proxy/cache server.

       -gopher_httpgw/-nogopher_httpgw
              The specified Gopher proxy server is a HTTP gateway for Gopher
              protocol.  When -gopher_proxy is set and this -gopher_httpgw
              option isn't used, pavuk is using proxy as HTTP tunnel with
              CONNECT request to open connections to Gopher servers.

       -ssl_proxy $site[:$port]
              SSL proxy (tunneling) server [as that in CERN httpd + patch or
              in Squid] with enabled CONNECT request (at least on port 443).
              This option is available only when compiled with SSL support
              (you need the SSleay or OpenSSL libraries with development
              headers)


Proxy Authentification
       -http_proxy_user $user
              Username for HTTP proxy authentification.

       -http_proxy_pass $pass
              Password for HTTP proxy authentification.

       -http_proxy_auth {1/2/3/4/user/Basic/Digest/NTLM}
              Authentification scheme for proxy access. Similar meaning as the
              -auth_scheme option (see help for this option for more details).
              Default is 2 (Basic scheme).

       -auth_proxy_ntlm_domain $str
              NT or LM domain used for authorization again HTTP proxy server
              when NTLM authentification scheme is required. This option is
              available only when compiled with OpenSSL or libdes libraries.

       -auth_reuse_proxy_nonce/-noauth_reuse_proxy_nonce
              When using HTTP Proxy Digest access authentification scheme use
              first received nonce value in multiple following requests.

       -ftp_proxy_user $user
              Username for FTP proxy authentification.

       -ftp_proxy_pass $pass
              Password for FTP proxy authentification.


Protocol/Download Options
       -ftp_passive
              Uses passive ftp when downloading via ftp.

       -ftp_active
              Uses active ftp when downloading via ftp.

       -active_ftp_port_range $min:$max
              This option permits to specify the ports used for active ftp.
              This permits easier firewall configuration since the range of
              ports can be restricted.

              Pavuk will randomly choose a number from within the specified
              range until an open port is found. Should no open ports be found
              within the given range, pavuk will default to a normal kernel-
              assigned port, and a message (debug level net) is output.

              The port range selected must be in the non-privileged range (eg.
              greater than or equal to 1024); it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that
              the chosen range be large enough to handle many simultaneous
              active connections (for example, 49152-65534, the IANA-
              registered ephemeral port range).

       -always_mdtm/-noalways_mdtm
              Force pavuk to always use "MDTM" to determine the file
              modification time and never uses cached times determined when
              listing the remote files.

       -remove_before_store/-noremove_before_store
              Force unlink'ing of files before new content is stored to a
              file. This is helpful if the local files are hardlinked to some
              other directory and after mirroring the hardlinks are checked.
              All "broken" hardlinks indicate a file update.

       -retry $nr
              Set the number of attempts to transfer processed document.
              Default set to 1, this mean pavuk will retry once to get
              documents which failed on first attempt.

       -nregets $nr
              Set the number of allowed regets on a single document, after a
              broken transfer.  Default value for this option is 2.

       -nredirs $nr
              Set number of allowed HTTP redirects. (use this for prevention
              of loops) Default value for this option is 5, and conform to
              HTTP specification.

       -force_reget/-noforce_reget
              Force reget'ing of the whole document after a broken transfer
              when the server doesn't support retrieving of partial content.
              Pavuk default behavior is to stop getting documents which don't
              allow restarting of transfer from specified position.

       -timeout $nr
              Timeout for stalled connections in minutes. This value is also
              used for connection timeouts. For sub-minute timeouts you can
              use floating point numbers.  Default timeout is 0, an that means
              timeout checking is disabled.

       -noRobots/-Robots
              This switch suppresses the use of the robots.txt standard, which
              is used to restrict access of Web robots to some locations on
              the web server. Default is allowed checking of robots.txt files
              on HTTP servers. Enable this option always when you are
              downloading huge sets of pages with unpredictable layout.  This
              prevents you from upsetting server administrators :-).

       -noEnc/-Enc
              This switch suppresses using of gzip or compress or deflate
              encoding in transfer. I don't know if some servers are broken or
              what, but they are propagating that MIME type application/gzip
              or application/compress as encoded. Turn this option off, when
              you doesn't have libz support compiled in and also gzip program
              which is used to decode document encoded this way.  At default
              is decoding of downloaded document disabled.

       -check_size/-nocheck_size
              The option -nocheck_size should be used if you are trying to
              download pages from a HTTP server which sends a wrong Content-
              Length: field in the MIME header of response.  Default pavuk
              behavior is to check this field and complain when something is
              wrong.

       -maxrate $nr
              If you don't want to give all your transfer bandwidth to pavuk,
              use this option to set pavuk's maximum transfer rate. This
              option accepts a floating point number to specify the transfer
              rate in kB/s. If you want get optimal settings, you also have to
              play with the size of the read buffer (option -bufsize) because
              pavuk is doing flow control only at application level.  At
              default pavuk use full bandwidth.

       -minrate $nr
              If you hate slow transfer rates, this option allows you to break
              transfers with slow speed. You can set the minimum transfer
              rate, and if the connection gets slower than the given rate, the
              transfer will be stopped. The minimum transfer rate is given in
              kB/s.  At default pavuk doesn't check this limit.

       -bufsize $nr
              This option is used to specify the size of the read buffer
              (default size: 32kB).  If you have a very fast connection, you
              may increase the size of the buffer to get a better read
              performance. If you need to decrease the transfer rate, you may
              need to decrease the size of the buffer and set the maximum
              transfer rate with the -maxrate option. This option accepts the
              size of the buffer in kB.

       -fs_quota $nr
              If you are running pavuk on a multiuser system, you may need to
              avoid filling up your file system. This option lets you specify
              how many space must remain free. If pavuk detects an underrun of
              the free space, it will stop downloading files. Specify this
              quota in kB. Default value is 0, and that mean no checking of
              this quota.

       -file_quota $nr
              This option is useful when you want to limit downloading of big
              files, but want to download at least $nr kilobytes from big
              files.  A big file will be transferred, and when it reaches the
              specified size, transfer will break. Such document will be
              processed as properly downloaded, so be careful when using this
              option.  At default pavuk is transferring full size of
              documents.

       -trans_quota $nr
              If you are aware that your selection should address a big amount
              of data, you can use this option to limit the amount of
              transferred data.  Default is by size unlimited transfer.

       -max_time $nr
              Set maximum amount of time for program run. After time is
              exceeded, pavuk will stop downloading. Time is specified in
              minutes. Default value is 0, and it means downloading time is
              not limited.

       -url_strategy $strategy
              This option allows you to specify a downloading order for URLs
              in document tree.  This option accepts the following strings as
              parameters :

              level - will order URLs as it loads it from HTML files (default)
              leveli - as previous, but inline objects URLs come first
              pre - will insert URLs from actual HTML document at start,
              before other
              prei - as previous, but inline objects URLs come first

       -send_if_range/-nosend_if_range
              Send If-Range: header in HTTP request. I found out, that some
              HTTP servers (greetings, MS :-)) are sending different ETag:
              fields in different responses for the same, unchanged document.
              This causes problems when pavuk attempts to reget a document
              from such a server: pavuk will remember the old ETag value and
              uses it it following requests for this document.  If the server
              checks it with the new ETag value and it differs, it will refuse
              to send only part of the document, and start the download from
              scratch.

       -ssl_version $v
              Set required SSL protocol version for SSL communication.  $v is
              one of ssl2, ssl23, ssl3 or tls1.  This option is available only
              when compiled with SSL support.  Default is ssl23.

       -unique_sslid/-nounique_sslid
              This option can be used if you want to use a unique SSL ID for
              all SSL sessions. Default pavuk behavior is to negotiate each
              time new session ID for each connection.  This option is
              available only when compiled with SSL support.

       -use_http11/-nouse_http11
              This option is used to switch between HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1
              protocol used with HTTP servers. Now is using of HTTP/1.1
              protocol not default because its implementation is very fresh
              and not 100% tested. Even though using of HTTP/1.1 is very
              recommended, because it is faster than HTTP/1.0 and uses less
              network bandwidth for initiating connections. In any further
              version I will activate using of HTTP/1.1 as default.

       -local_ip $addr
              You can use this option when you want to use specified network
              interface for communication with other hosts. This option is
              suitable for multihomed hosts with several network interfaces.
              Address should be entered as regular IP address or as host name.

       -identity $str
              This option allows you to specify content of User-Agent: field
              of HTTP request.  This is usable, when scripts on remote server
              returns different document on same URL for different browsers,
              or if some HTTP server refuse to serve document for Web robots
              like pavuk. Default pavuk sends in User-Agent: field
              pavuk/$VERSION string.

       -auto_referer/-noauto_referer
              This option forces pavuk to send HTTP Referer: header field with
              starting URLs.  Content of this field will be self URL. Using
              this option is required, when remote server checks the Referer:
              field.  At default pavuk wont send Referer: field with starting
              URLs.

       -referer/-noreferer
              This option allows to enable and disable the transmission of
              HTTP Referer: header field. At default pavuk sends Referer:
              field.

       -httpad $str
              In some cases you may want to add user defined fields to
              HTTP/HTTPS requests.  This option is exactly for this purpose.
              In $str you can directly specify content of additional header.
              If you specify only raw header, it will be used only for
              starting requests. When you want to use this header with each
              request while crawling, prefix the header with + character.

       -del_after/-nodel_after
              This option allows you to delete FILES from REMOTE server, when
              download is properly finished. At default is this option off.

       -FTPlist/-noFTPlist
              When option -FTPlist will be used, pavuk will retrieve content
              of FTP directories with FTP command LIST instead of NLST. So the
              same listing will be retrieved as with "ls -l" UNIX command.
              This option is required if you need to preserve permissions of
              remote files or you need to preserve symbolic links.  Pavuk
              supports wide listing on FTP servers with regular BSD or SYSV
              style "ls -l" directory listing, on FTP servers with EPFL
              listing format, VMS style listing, DOS/Windows style listing and
              Novel listing format.  Default pavuk behavior is to use NLST fro
              FTP directory listings.

       -ftp_list_options $str
              Some FTP servers require to supply extra options to LIST or NLST
              FTP commands to show all files and directories properly. But be
              sure not to use any extra options which can reformat output of
              the listing. Useful is especially -a option which force FTP
              server to show also dot files and directories and with broken
              WuFTP servers it also helps to produce full directory listings
              not just files.

       -fix_wuftpd/-nofix_wuftpd
              This option is result of several attempts to to get working
              properly the -remove_old option with WuFTPd server when -ftplist
              option is used. The problem is that FTP command LIST on WuFTPd
              don't mind when trying to list nonexisting directory, and
              indicates success in FTP response code.  When you activate this
              option, pavuk uses extra FTP command (STAT -d dir) to check
              whether the directory really exists. Don't use this option until
              you are sure that you really need it!



Authentification
       -auth_file $file
              File where you have stored authentification information for
              access to some service. For file structure see below in FILES
              section.

       -auth_name $user
              If you are using this parameter, program is doing
              authentification with each HTTP access to document. Use this
              only if you know that only one HTTP server could be accessed or
              use -asite option to specify site to which you use
              authentification. Else your auth parameters will be sent to each
              accessed HTTP server.

       -auth_passwd $passwd
              Value of this parameter is used as password for authentification

       -auth_scheme {1/2/3/4/user/Basic/Digest/NTLM}
              This parameter specifies used authentification scheme.
              1 or user means user authentification scheme is used as defined
              in HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1.  Password and user name are sent
              unencoded.
              2 or Basic means Basic authentification scheme is used as
              defined in HTTP/1.0.  Password and user name are sent BASE64
              encoded.
              3 or Digest means Digest access authentification scheme based on
              MD5 checksums as defined in RFC2069.
              4 or NTLM means NTLM proprietary access authentification scheme
              used by Microsoft IIS or Proxy servers.  When you use this
              scheme, you must also specify NT or LM domain with option
              -auth_ntlm_domain. This scheme is supported only when compiled
              with OpenSSL or libdes libraries.

       -auth_ntlm_domain $str
              NT or LM domain used for authorization again HTTP server when
              NTLM authentification scheme is required. This option is
              available only when compiled with OpenSSL or libdes libraries.

       -auth_reuse_nonce/-noauth_reuse_nonce
              While using HTTP Digest access authentification scheme use first
              received nonce value in more following requests.  Default pavuk
              negotiates nonce for each request.

       -ssl_key_file $file
              File with public key for SSL certificate (learn more from SSLeay
              or OpenSSL documentation) This option is available only when
              compiled with SSL support (you need SSleay or OpenSSL libraries
              and development headers)

       -ssl_cert_file $file
              Certificate file in PEM format (learn more from SSLeay or
              OpenSSL documentation) This option is available only when
              compiled with SSL support (you need SSleay or OpenSSL libraries
              and development headers)

       -ssl_cer_passwd $str
              Password used to generate certificate (learn more from SSLeay or
              OpenSSL documentation) This option is available only when
              compiled with SSL support (you need SSLeay or OpenSSL libraries
              and development headers)

       -nss_cert_dir $dir
              Config directory for NSS (Netscape SSL implementation)
              certificates. Usually ~/.netscape (created by Netscape
              communicator/navigator) or profile directory below ~/.mozilla
              (created by Mozilla browser). The directory should contain
              cert7.db and key3.db files. If you don't use Mozilla nor
              Netscape, you must create this files by utilities distributed
              with NSS libraries. Pavuk opens certificate database only
              readonly.  This option is available only when pavuk is compiled
              with SSL support provided by Netscape NSS SSL implementation.

       [-nss_accept_unknown_cert/-nonss_accept_unknown_cert]
              By default will pavuk reject connection to SSL server which
              certificate is not stored in local certificate database (set by
              -nss_cert_dir option).  You must explicitly force pavuk to allow
              connection to servers with unknown certificates.  This option is
              available only when pavuk is compiled with SSL support provided
              by Netscape NSS SSL implementation.

       [-nss_domestic_policy/-nss_export_policy]
              Selects sets of ciphers allowed/disabled by USA export rules.
              This option is available only when pavuk is compiled with SSL
              support provided by Netscape NSS SSL implementation.


       -from $email
              This parameter is used when accessing anonymous FTP server as
              password or is optionally inserted into From field in HTTP
              request. If not specified pavuk discovers this from USER
              environment variable and from site hostname.

       -send_from/-nosend_from
              This option is used for enabling or disabling sending of user
              identification, entered in -from option, as FTP anonymous user
              password and From: field of HTTP request.  As default is this
              option off.

       -ftp_login_handshake $host $handshake
              When you need to use nonstandard login procedure for some of FTP
              servers, you can use this option to change default pavuk login
              procedure. To allow more flexibility, you can assign the login
              procedure to some server or to all. When $host is specified as
              empty string (""), than attached login procedure is assigned to
              all FTP servers besides those having assigned own login
              procedures. In the $handshake parameter you can specify exact
              login procedure specified by FTP commands followed by expected
              FTP response codes delimited with backslash (\) characters.
              For example this is default login procedure when logging in
              regular ftp server without going through proxy server : USER
              %u\331\PASS %p\230. There are two commands followed by two
              response codes. After USER command pavuk expects FTP response
              code 331 and after PASS command pavuk expects from server FTP
              response code 230. In ftp commands you can use following macros
              which will be replaced by respective values:

               %u - user name used to access FTP server
               %p - password used to access FTP server
               %U - user name used to access FTP proxy server
               %P - password used to access FTP proxy server
               %h - hostname of FTP server
               %s - port number on which FTP server listens


Site/Domain/Port Limitation Options
       -asite $list
              Specify comma separated list of allowed sites on which
              referenced documents are stored.

       -dsite $list
              Specify comma separated list of disallowed sites.  Previous
              parameter is opposite to this one. If both are used the last
              occurrence of them is used to be valid.

       -adomain $list
              Specify comma separated list of allowed domains on which
              referenced documents are stored.

       -ddomain $list
              Specify comma separated list of disallowed domains. Previous
              parameter is opposite to this one. If both are used the last
              occurrence of them is used to be valid.

       -aport $list
              In $list, you can write comma separated list of ports from which
              you allow to download documents.

       -dport $list
              This option is opposite option to previous option. It is used to
              specify denied ports. If both -aport and -dport options are used
              the last occurrence of them is used to be valid and all other
              occurrences will be omitted.


Limitation Document properties
       -amimet $list
              List of comma separated allowed MIME types. You can use with
              this option also wildcard patterns.

       -dmimet $list
              List of comma separated disallowed MIME types. You can use with
              this option also wildcard patterns.  Previous parameter is
              opposite to this one. If both are used the last occurrence of
              them is used to be valid.

       -maxsize $nr
              Maximum allowed size of document.  This option is applied only
              when pavuk is able to detect the document before starting the
              transfer.  Default value is 0, and it means this limit isn't
              applied.

       -minsize $nr
              minimal allowed size of document.  This option is applied only
              when pavuk is able to detect the document before starting the
              transfer.  Default value is 0, and it means this limit isn't
              applied.

       -newer_than $time
              Allow only transfer of documents with modification time newer
              than specified in parameter $time. Format of $time is:
              YYYY.MM.DD.hh:mm.  To apply this option pavuk must be able to
              detect modification time of document.

       -older_than $time
              Allow only transfer of documents with modification time older
              than specified in parameter $time. Format of $time is:
              YYYY.MM.DD.hh:mm.  To apply this option pavuk must be able to
              detect modification time of document.

       -noCGI/-CGI
              this switch prevents to transfer dynamically generated
              parametric documents through CGI interface. This is detected
              with occurrence of ? character inside URL.  Default pavuk
              behavior is to allow transfer of URLs with query strings.

       -alang $list
              this allows you to specify ordered comma separated list of
              preferred natural languages. This option work only with HTTP and
              HTTPS protocol using Accept-Language: MIME field.

       -acharset $list
              This options allows you to enter comma separated list of
              preferred encoding of transfered documents. This works only with
              HTTP and HTTPS urls and only if such document encodings are
              located on destination server.
              example: -acharset iso-8859-2,windows-1250,utf8


Limitation Document name
       -asfx $list
              This parameter allows you to specify set of suffixes used to
              restrict selection of documents which will be processed.

       -dsfx $list
              Set of suffixes that are used to specify restriction on
              selection of documents.  This one is inverse to previous option.
              They are segregating each other.

       -aprefix $list, -dprefix $list
              This two options allow you to specify set of allowed or
              disallowed prefixes of documents. They are segregating each
              other.

       -pattern $pattern
              This option allows you to specify wildcard pattern for
              documents. All documents are tested if they match this pattern.

       -rpattern $reg_exp
              This is equal option as previous, but this uses regular
              expressions.  Available only on platforms which have any
              supported RE implementation.

       -skip_pattern $pattern
              This option allows you to specify wildcard pattern for documents
              that should be skipped.  All documents are tested if they match
              this pattern.

       -skip_rpattern $reg_exp
              This is equal option as previous, but this uses regular
              expressions.  Available only on platforms which have any
              supported RE implementation.

       -url_pattern $pattern
              This option allows you to specify wildcard pattern for URLs. All
              URLs are tested if they match this pattern.
              Example:
              -url_pattern http://\*.idata.sk:\*/~ondrej/\* . this option
              enables all HTTP URLs from domain .idata.sk on all ports which
              are located under /~ondrej/.

       -url_rpattern $reg_exp
              This is equal option as previous, but this uses regular
              expressions.  Available only on platforms which have any
              supported RE implementation.

       -skip_url_pattern $pattern
              This option allows you to specify wildcard pattern for URLs that
              should be skipped.  All URLs are tested if they match this
              pattern.

       -skip_url_rpattern $reg_exp
              This is equal option as previous, but this uses regular
              expressions.  Available only on platforms which have any
              supported RE implementation.

       -aip_pattern $re
              This option allows you to limit set of transferred documents by
              server IP address.  IP address can be specified as regular
              expressions, so it is possible to specify set of IP addresses by
              one expression.  Available only on platforms which have any
              supported RE implementation.

       -dip_pattern $re
              This option similar to previous option, but is used to specify
              set of disallowed IP addresses.  Available only on platforms
              which have any supported RE implementation.

       -tag_pattern $tag $attrib $url
              More powerful version of -url_pattern option for more precise
              matching of allowed URLs based on HTML tag name pattern, HTML
              tag attribute name pattern and on URL pattern. You can use in
              all three parameters of this option wildcard patterns, thus
              something like -tag_pattern '*' '*' url_pattern is equal to
              -url_pattern url_pattern. The $tag and $attrib parameters are
              always matched again uppercase strings. For example if you want
              just let pavuk follow only regular links ignoring any
              stylesheets, images, etc., use option -tag_pattern A HREF '*'.

       -tag_rpattern $tag $attrib $url
              This is variation on the -tag_pattern. It uses regular
              expression patterns in parameters instead of wildcard patterns
              used in the previous option.


Limitation Protocol Option
       -noHTTP/-HTTP
              This switch suppresses all transfers through HTTP protocol.
              Default is transfer trough HTTP enabled.

       -noSSL/-SSL
              This switch suppresses all transfers through HTTPS protocol
              (HTTP protocol over SSL) .  Default is transfer trough HTTPS
              enabled.  This option is available only when compiled with SSL
              support (you need SSleay or OpenSSL libraries and development
              headers)

       -noGopher/-Gopher
              Suppress all transfers through Gopher Internet protocol.
              Default is transfer trough Gopher enabled.

       -noFTP/-FTP
              This switch prevents processing documents allocated on all FTP
              servers.  Default is transfer trough FTP enabled.

       -noFTPS/-FTPS
              This switch prevents processing documents allocated on all FTP
              servers accessed through SSL.  Default is transfer trough FTPS
              enabled.  This option is available only when compiled with SSL
              support (you need SSleay or OpenSSL libraries and development
              headers)

       -FTPhtml/-noFTPhtml
              By using of option -FTPhtml you can force pavuk to process HTML
              files downloaded with FTP protocol.  At default pavuk won't
              parse HTML files from FTP servers.

       -FTPdir/-noFTPdir
              Force recursive processing of FTP directories too.  At default
              is recursive downloading from FTP servers denied.

       -disable_html_tag $TAG,[$ATTRIB][;...]
              -enable_html_tag $TAG,[$ATTRIB][;...] Enable or disable
              processing of particular HTML tags or attributes.  At default
              all supported HTML tags are enabled.

              For example if you don't want to process all images you should
              use option -disable_html_tag 'IMG,SRC;INPUT,SRC;BODY,BACKGROUND'
              .


Other Limitation Options
       -subdir $dir
              Subdirectory of local tree directory, to limit some of the modes
              {sync, resumeregets, linkupdate} in its tree scan.

       -dont_leave_site/-leave_site
              (Don't) leave starting site. At default pavuk can span host when
              recursing through WWW tree.

       -dont_leave_dir/-leave_dir
              (Don't) leave starting directory. If -dont_leave_dir option is
              used pavuk will stay only in starting directory (including its
              own subdirectories).  At default pavuk can leave starting
              directories.

       -leave_site_enter_dir/-dont_leave_site_enter_dir
              If you are downloading WWW tree which spans multiple hosts with
              huge trees, you may want to allow downloading of document which
              are in directory hierarchy below directory which we visited as
              first on each site. To obtain this, use option
              -dont_leave_site_enter_dir. As default pavuk will go also to
              higher directory levels on that site.

       -lmax $nr
              Set maximum allowed level of tree traverse. Default is set to 0,
              what means that pavuk can traverse at infinitum.  As of version
              0.8pl1 inline objects of HTML pages are placed at same level as
              parent HTML page.

       -leave_level $nr
              Maximum level of documents outside from site of starting URL.
              Default is set to 0, and 0 means that checking is not applied.

       -site_level $nr
              Maximum level of sites outside from site of starting URL.
              Default is set to 0, and 0 means that checking is not applied.

       -dmax $nr
              Set maximum allowed number of documents that are processed.
              Default value is 0.  That means no restrictions are used in
              number of processed documents.

       -singlepage/-nosinglepage
              Using option -singlepage allows you to transfer just HTML pages
              with all its inlined objects (pictures, sounds, frame documents,
              ...).  As default is disabled single page transfer. This option
              makes -mode singlepage option obsolete.

       -limit_inlines/-dont_limit_inlines
              With this option you can control whether limiting options apply
              also to inline objects (pictures, sounds, ...). This is useful
              when you want to download specified set of HTML pages with all
              inline options without any restrictions.



       -user_condition $str
              Script or program name for users own conditions.  You can write
              any script which should with exit value decide if download URL
              or not.  Script gets from pavuk any number of options, with this
              meaning :

                 -url $url - processed URL
                 -parent $url - any number of parent URLs
                 -level $nr - level of this URL from starting URL
                 -size $nr - size of requested URL
                 -date $datenr - modification time of requested URL in format
                 YYYYMMDDhhmmss

              The exit status 0 of script or program means that current URL
              should be rejected and nonzero exit status means that URL should
              be accepted.
              Warning : use user conditions only if required because of big
              slowdowns caused by forking scripts for each checked URL.

       -follow_cmd $str
              This option allows you to specify script or program which can by
              its exit status decide whether to follow URLs from current HTML
              document. This script will be called after download of each HTML
              document.  The script will get following options as it's
              parameters:

                 -url $url - URL of current HTML document
                 -infile $file - local file where is stored HTML document

              The exit status 0 of script or program means that URLs from
              current document will be disallowed, other exit status means,
              that pavuk can follow links from current HTML document.




Javascript support
       Support for scripting languages like JavaScript or VBScript in pavuk is
       done bit hacky way. There is no interpreter for this languages, so not
       all things will work. Whole support which pavuk have for this scripting
       languages is based on regular expression patterns specified by user.
       Pavuk search for this patterns in DOM event attributes of HTML tags, in
       javascript:... URLs, in inline scripts in HTML documents enclosed
       between <script></script> tags and in separate javascript files.
       Support for scripting languages is only available when pavuk is
       compiled with proper regular expression library (POSIX/GNU/PCRE).

       -enable_js/-disable_js
              This options are used to enable or disable processing of
              Javascript parts of HTML documents. You must enable this option
              to be able to use processing of javascript patterns.

       -js_pattern $re
              With this option you are specifying what patterns match
              interested parts of Javascript for extracting URLs. The
              parameter must be RE pattern with exactly one subpattern which
              match exactly the URL part. For example to match URL in
              following type of javascript expressions :
                document.b1.src='pics/button1_pre.jpg'
              you can use this pattern
                "^document.[a-zA-Z0-9_]*.src[ ]*=[ ]*'(.*)'$"

       -js_transform $p $t $h $a
              This option is similar to previous, but you can use custom
              transform rules for the URL parts of patterns and also specify
              the exact HTML tag and attribute where to look for this pattern.
              The $p is the pattern to match the interested part of script.
              The $t is transform rule for the URL, in this parameter the $x
              parts will be replaced by x-th subpattern of the $p pattern. The
              $h parameter is exact HTML tag or "*" when this apply to
              javascript: URLs or DOM event attribs or "" (empty string) when
              this apply to javascript body of HTML document or separate JS
              file. The $a parameter is exact HTML attrib of tag or "" (empty
              string) when this rule apply to javascript body.

       -js_transform2 $p $t $h $a
              This option is very similar to previous. The meaning of all
              parameters is same, just the pattern $p can have only one
              substring which will be used in the transform rule $t. This is
              required to allow rewriting of URL parts of the tags and
              scripts. This option can also be used to force pavuk to
              recognize HTML targ/attribute pairs which pavuk does not
              support.


Cookie
       -cookie_file $file
              File where are stored cookie infos. This file must be in
              Netscape cookie file format (generated with Netscape Navigator
              or Communicator ...).

       -cookie_send/-nocookie_send
              Use collected cookies in HTTP/HTTPS requests.  Pavuk will not
              send at default cookies.

       -cookie_recv/-nocookie_recv
              Store received cookies from HTTP/HTTPS responses into memory
              cookie cache.  At default pavuk will not remember received
              cookies.

       -cookie_update/-nocookie_update
              Update cookie file on disk and synchronize it with changes made
              by any concurrent processes.  At default pavuk will not update
              cookie file on disk.

       -cookies_max $nr
              Maximum number of cookies in memory cookie cache.  Default value
              is 0, and that means no restrictions for cookies number.

       -disabled_cookie_domains $list
              Comma-separated list of cookie domains which are permitted to
              send cookies stored into cookie cache

       -cookie_check/-nocookie_check
              Check when receiving cookie, if cookie domain is equal to domain
              of server which sends this cookie. At default pavuk check is
              server is setting cookies for its domain, and if it tries to set
              cookie for foreign domain pavuk will complain about that and
              will reject such cookie.


HTML rewriting engine tuning options
       -noRelocate/-Relocate
              This switch prevents the program to rewrite relative URLs to
              absolute, after HTML document is transfered. Default pavuk
              behavior is to maintain link consistence of HTML documents. So
              always when HTML document is downloaded pavuk will rewrite all
              URLs to point to local document if it is available and if it is
              not available it will point to remote document. After document
              is properly downloaded, pavuk will update links in HTML
              documents, which point to this one.

       -all_to_local/-noall_to_local
              This option forces pavuk to change all URLs inside HTML document
              to local URLs immediately after download of document. Default is
              this option disabled.

       -sel_to_local/-nosel_to_local
              This option forces pavuk to change all URLs, which accomplish
              conditions for download, to local inside HTML document
              immediately after download of document.  I recommend to use this
              option, when you are sure, that transfer will be without any
              problems. This option can save a lot of processor time.  Default
              is this option disabled.

       -all_to_remote/-noall_to_remote
              This option forces pavuk to change all URLs inside HTML document
              to remote URLs immediately after download of document.  Default
              is this option disabled.

       -post_update/-nopost_update
              This option is especially designed to allow in -fnrules option
              doing rules based on MIME type of document. This option forces
              pavuk to generate local names for documents just after pavuk
              knows what is the MIME type of document. This have big impact on
              the rewriting engine of links inside HTML documents. This option
              causes disfunction of other options for controlling the link
              rewriting engine. Use this option only when you know what you
              are doing :-)

       -dont_touch_url_pattern $pat
              This options serves to deny rewriting and processing of
              particular URLs in HTML documents by pavuk HTML rewriting
              engine. This option accepts wildcard patterns to specify such
              URLs. Matching is done against untouched URLs so when he URL is
              relative, you must use pattern which matches the relative URL,
              when it is absolute, you must use absolute URL.

       -dont_touch_url_rpattern $pat
              This option is variation on previous option. This one uses
              regular patterns for matching of URLs instead of wildcard
              patterns used by -dont_touch_url_pattern option. This option is
              available only when pavuk is compiled with support for regular
              expression patterns.

       -dont_touch_tag_rpattern $pat
              This option is variation on previous option, just matching is
              made on full HTML tag with included <>. This option accepts
              regular expression patterns. It is available only when pavuk is
              compiled with support for regular expression patterns.


Filename/URL Conversion Option
       -tr_del_chr $str
              All characters found in $str will be deleted from local name of
              document.  $str should contain escape sequences similar like in
              tr command:
              \n - newline
              \r - carriage return
              \t - horizontal tab space
              \0xXX - hexadecimal  ASCII value
              [:upper:] - all uppercase letters
              [:lower:] - all lowercase letters
              [:alpha:] - all letters
              [:alnum:] - all letters and digits
              [:digit:] - all digits
              [:xdigit:] - all hexadecimal digits
              [:space:] - all horizontal and vertical whitespace
              [:blank:] - all horizontal whitespace
              [:cntrl:] - all control characters
              [:print:] - all printable characters including space
              [:nprint:] - all non printable characters
              [:punct:] - all punctation characters
              [:graph:] - all printable characters excluding space

       -tr_str_str $str1 $str2
              String $str1 from local name of document will be replaced with
              $str2.

       -tr_chr_chr $chrset1 $chrset2
              Characters from $chrset1 from local name of document will be
              replaced with corresponding character from $chrset2. $charset1
              and $charset2 should have same syntax as $str in -tr_del_chr
              option.

       -store_name $str
              When you want to change local filename of first file downloaded
              with singlepage mode, you should use this option.

       -index_name $str
              With this option you can change directory index name. As default
              is used _._.html .

       -store_index/-nostore_index
              With option -nostore_index you should deny storing of directory
              indexes into HTML files.

       -fnrules $t $m $r
              This is a very powerful option! This option is used to flexible
              change layout of local document tree. It accepts three
              parameters. First parameter $t is used to say what type is
              following pattern.  F is used for wildcard pattern (uses
              fnmatch()) and R is used for regular expression pattern (using
              any supported RE implementation).  Second parameter is matching
              pattern used to select URLs for this rule.  If URL match this
              pattern, then local name for this URL is computed following
              rules of third parameter.  And third parameter is local name
              building rule. Pavuk now supports two kinds of local name
              building rules. One is simple based only on simple macros and
              other more complicated extended rule, which also enables to
              perform several functions.  Recognition between those two kinds
              of rules is done by looking at first character of rule.  In case
              when first character is '(', rule is extended and in all other
              cases it is the simple kind of rule.

              Simple rule should contain literals or escaped macros.  Macros
              are escaped by % character or by $ character.

              Here is list of recognized macros:


              $x - where x is any positive number. This macro is replaced with
              x-th substring matched by RE pattern. (If you use this you need
              to understand RE !)
              %i - is replaced with protocol id (http, https, ftp, gopher)
              %p - is replaced with password. (use this only when usable)
              %u - is replaced with username.
              %h - is replaced with host name.
              %m - is replaced with domain name.
              %r - is replaced with port number.
              %d - is replaced with path to document.
              %n - is replaced with document name.
              %b - is replaced with basename of document (without extension).
              %e - is replaced with extension.
              %s - is replaced with searchstring.
              %M - is replaced with MIME type of document. When you are using
              this macro, you *must* use also -post_update option else it
              won't work.
              %E - is replaced with default extension assigned to MIME type of
              document. When you are using this macro, you *must* use also
              -post_update option else it won't work.
              %x - where x is positive number. This macro is replaced with x-
              th directory from path to document from beginning.
              %-x - where x is positive number. This macro is replaced with x-
              th directory from path to document from end.

              Here is example. If you want place document into single
              directories by extension, you should use following fnrules
              option:
              -fnrules F '*' '/%e/%n'

              Extended rule ever begins with character ´('. It uses some kind
              of LISP like syntax.

              Here are base rules for writing extended rules : - the local
              filename of of this kind is return value function
              - each function is enclosed inside round braces ()
              - first token right after opening brace is function name
              - each function have nonzero fixed number of parameters
              - each function returns numeric or string value

              - each macro is prefixed by % character and is one character
              long

                - returns string value equal to return value of
                  JavaScript function
                - this function is available only when pavuk is compiled
                  with support for JavaScript bindings

              For example, if you are mirroring very huge number of internet
              sites into same local directory, too much entries in one
              directory, should cause performance problems. You may use for
              example hsh or md5 functions to generate one additional level of
              hash directories based on hostname whit one of following options
              :

              -fnrules F '*' '(sc (nc "%02d/" (hsh %h 100)) %o)'
              -fnrules F '*' '(sc (ss (md5 %h) 0 2) %o)'

       -base_level $nr
              Number of directory levels to omit in local tree.

              For example when downloading URL
              ftp://ftp.idata.sk/pub/unix/www/pavuk-0.7pl1.tgz you enter at
              command line -base_level 4 in local tree will be created
              www/pavuk-0.7pl1.tgz not
              ftp/ftp.idata.sk_21/pub/unix/www/pavuk-0.7pl1.tgz as normally.

       -default_prefix $str
              Default prefix of mirrored directory. This option is used only
              when you are trying to synchronize content of remote directory
              which was downloaded using -base_level option. Also you must use
              directory based synchronization method, not URL based
              synchronization method. This is especially useful, when used in
              conjunction with -remove_old option.

       -remove_adv/-noremove_adv
              This option is used for turn on/off of removing HTML tags which
              contains advertisement banners.  The banners are not removed
              from HTML file, but are commented out.  Such URLs also will not
              be downloaded.  This option have effect only when used with
              option -adv_re.  Default is turned off.  This option is
              available only when your system have support for one of
              supported regular expressions implementation.

       -adv_re $RE
              This option is used to specify regular expressions for matching
              URLs of advertisement banners.  For example : -adv_re
              http://ad.doubleclick.net/.* is used to match all files from
              server ad.doubleclick.net.  This option is available only when
              your system have any supported regular expressions
              implementation.

       -unique_name/-nounique_name
              Pavuk as default always attempts to assign to unique URL unique
              local filename.  If this behavior is not wanted, you can use
              option -nounique_name to disable this.


Other Options
       -sleep $nr
              This option allows you to specify number of seconds during that
              the program will be suspended between two transfers. Useful to
              deny server overload.  Default value for this option is 0.

       -rsleep/-norsleep
              When this option is active, pavuk randomizes the the sleep time
              between transfers in interval between zero and value specified
              with -sleep option. Default is this option inactive.

       -ddays $nr
              If document has modification time later as $nr days, then in
              sync mode pavuk attempts to retrieve newer copy of document from
              remote server. Default value is 0.

       -remove_old/-noremove_old
              Remove improper documents (that, which doesn't exist on remote
              site).  This option have effect only when used in directory
              based sync mode.  When used with URL based sync mode, pavuk will
              not remove any old files which were excluded from document tree
              and are not referenced in any HTML document.  You must also use
              option -subdir, to let pavuk find files which belongs to current
              mirror.  As default pavuk won't remove any old files.

       -browser $str
              is used to set your browser command (in URL tree dialog you can
              use right click to raise menu, from which you can start browser
              on actually selected URL).  This option is available only when
              compiled with GTK GUI and with support for URL tree preview.

       -debug/-nodebug
              turns on displaying of debug messages. This option is available
              only when compiled with -DDEBUG.  If -debug option is used pavuk
              will output verbose information about documents, whole protocol
              level information, locking informations and more (depends on
              -debug_level setup). This options is used just like trigger to
              enable output of debug messages selected by -debug_level option.
              Default is debug mode turned off.

       -debug_level $level
              Set level of required debug informations. $level can be numeric
              value which represent binary mask for requested debug levels, or
              comma separated list of supported debug levels.  Currently pavuk
              supports following debug levels :
              html - for HTML parser debugging
              protos - to see server side protocol messages
              protoc - to see client side protocol messages
              procs - to see some special procedure calls
              locks - for debugging of documents locking
              net - for debugging some low level network stuff
              misc - for miscellaneous unsorted debug messages
              user - for verbose user level messages
              all - request all currently supported debug levels
              mtlock - locking of resources in multithreading environment
              mtthr - launching/weaking/sleeping/stoping of threads in
              multithreaded environment
              protod - for DEBUGGING of POST requests
              limits - for debugging limiting options, you will see the reason
              why particular URLs are rejected by pavuk and which option
              caused this.
              ssl - to enable verbose reporting about SSL related things.

       -remind_cmd $str
              This option have effect only when running pavuk in reminder
              mode. To command specified with this option pavuk sends result
              of running reminder mode.  There are listed URLs which are
              changed and URLs which have any errors.  Default remind command
              is "mailx user@server -s \"pavuk reminder result\"" .

       -nscache_dir $dir
              Path to Netscape browser cache directory. If you specify this
              path, pavuk attempts to find out if you have URL in this cache.
              If URL is there it will be fetched else pavuk will download it
              from net. The cache directory index file must be named index.db
              and must be located in the cache directory.  To support this
              feature, pavuk have to be linked with BerkeleyDB 1.8x .

       -mozcache_dir $dir
              Path to Mozilla browser cache directory. Same functionality as
              with previous option, just for different browser with different
              cache formats.  Pavuk supports both formats of Mozilla browser
              disk cache (old for versions <0.9 and new used in 0.9=<).  The
              old format cache directory must contain cache directory index
              database with name cache.db. Then new format cache directory
              must contain map file _CACHE_MAP_, and three block files
              _CACHE_001_, _CACHE_002_, _CACHE_003_.  To support old Mozilla
              cache format, pavuk have to be linked with BerkeleyDB 1.8x. New
              Mozilla cache format doesn't require any external library.

       -post_cmd $str
              Post-processing command, which will be executed after successful
              download of document.  This command may somehow handle with
              document. During time of running this command, pavuk leaves
              actual document locked, so there isn't chance that some other
              pavuk process will modify document.  This postprocessing command
              will get three additional parameters from pavuk.
                 - local name of document
                 - 1/0 1 if document is HTML document, 0 if not
                 - original URL of this document

       -hack_add_index/-nohack_add_index
              This is bit hacky option. It forces pavuk to add to URL queue
              also directory indexes of all queued documents. This allow pavuk
              to download more documents from site, than it is able achieve in
              normal traversing of HTML documents.  Bit dirty but useful in
              some cases.

       -js_script_file $file
              Pavuk have optionally builtin JavaScript interpreter to allow
              high level customization of some internal procedures. Currently
              you are allowed to customize with your own JavaScript functions
              two things. You can use it to set precise limiting options, or
              you can write own functions which can be used inside rules of
              -fnrules option.  With this option you can load JavaScript
              script with functions into pavuks internal JavaScript
              interpreter. To learn more about this capabilities read separate
              document jsbind.txt which comes with pavuk sources in toplevel
              directory.  This option is available only when you have compiled
              pavuk with support for JavaScript bindings.


EXIT STATUS
       As of version 0.9pl29 pavuk have changed indication of status by exit
       codes.  In earlier versions exit status 0 was for no error and nonzero
       exit status was something like count of failed documents.  In all
       version after 0.0pl29 there are defined following exit codes:

           0 - no error, everything is OK
           1 - error in configuration of pavuk options or
               error in config files
           2 - some error occurred while downloading documents

       ~/.pavukrc

       ~/.pavuk_prefs

              These files are used as default configuration files.  You may
              specify there some constant values like your proxy server or
              your preferred WWW browser. Configuration options reflect
              command line options.  Not all parameters are suitable for use
              in default configuration file.  You should select only some of
              them, which you really need.

              File ~/.pavuk_prefs is special file which contains automatically
              stored configuration.  This file is used only when running GUI
              interface of pavuk and option -prefs is active.

              First (if present) parsed file is @SYSCONFDIR@/pavukrc then
              ~/.pavukrc (if present), then ~/.pavuk_prefs (if present).  Last
              the command line is parsed. The precedence is as follows :

              - highest -
              Entered in user interface
              Entered in command line
              ~/.pavuk_prefs
              ~/.pavukrc
              @SYSCONFDIR@/pavukrc
              - lowest -

              Here is table of config file - command line options pairs.

       try to look inside config.c source file.

       See pavukrc.sample file for example

       .pavuk_authinfo

              File should contain as many authentification records as you
              need.  Records are separated by any number of empty lines.
              Parameter name is case insensitive.
