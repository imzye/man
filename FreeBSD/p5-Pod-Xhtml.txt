NAME
       Pod::Hyperlink::BounceURL - Allow off-page links in POD to point to a
       URL

SYNOPSIS
               use Pod::Hyperlink::BounceURL;
               my $linkparser = new Pod::Hyperlink::BounceURL;
               $linkparser->configure( URL => '/cgi-perl/support/bounce.pl?page=%s' );
               my $pod2xhtml = new Pod::Xhtml( LinkParser => $linkparser );

DESCRIPTION
       Some links in your pod may not be resolveable by Pod::Hyperlink, e.g.
       "L<Some::Module>" - this module allows you to detect such links and
       generate a hyperlink instead of some static text.  The target URL will
       probably be some kind of dynamic webpage or CGI application which can
       then serve up the relevant page or send a redirect to the page, hence
       the "bounce" in this module's name.

       This module overrides the type() method and, for relevant links, will
       return a string which is "bounceurl:" followed by the URL, instead of
       returning "page" or "item".  Your pod-conversion module can then switch
       on this case and emit the correct kind of markup.  Pod::Xhtml supports
       the use of this module.

METHODS
       configure( %OPTIONS )
           Set persistent configuration for this object. See "OPTIONS".

       type()
           Behaves as Pod::Hyperlink's type() method except for the
           unresolveable links, where the string returned is as described in
           "DESCRIPTION".

OPTIONS
       URL The URL to handle the link, which may be absolute or relative, of
           any protocol - it's just treated as a string and is passed through
           sprintf(), with two string arguments that are both already URL-
           escaped.

           The first argument is the page name, and will always exist. The
           second argument is the "node" within the page, and may be empty.

           Insert '%s' where you wish the arguments to be interpolated. The
           string goes through sprintf() so you should have '%%' where you
           want an actual percent sign. If you need the arguments in a
           different order, see the perl-specific features of "sprintf" in
           perlfunc.
