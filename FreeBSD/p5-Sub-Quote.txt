NAME
       Sub::Defer - Defer generation of subroutines until they are first
       called

SYNOPSIS
        use Sub::Defer;

        my $deferred = defer_sub 'Logger::time_since_first_log' => sub {
           my $t = time;
           sub { time - $t };
        };

         Logger->time_since_first_log; # returns 0 and replaces itself
         Logger->time_since_first_log; # returns time - $t

DESCRIPTION
       These subroutines provide the user with a convenient way to defer
       creation of subroutines and methods until they are first called.

SUBROUTINES
   defer_sub
        my $coderef = defer_sub $name => sub { ... }, \%options;

       This subroutine returns a coderef that encapsulates the provided sub -
       when it is first called, the provided sub is called and is -itself-
       expected to return a subroutine which will be goto'ed to on subsequent
       calls.

       If a name is provided, this also installs the sub as that name - and
       when the subroutine is undeferred will re-install the final version for
       speed.

       Exported by default.

       Options

       A hashref of options can optionally be specified.

       package
           The package to generate the sub in.  Will be overridden by a fully
           qualified $name option.  If not specified, will default to the
           caller's package.

       attributes
           The "Subroutine Attributes" in perlsub to apply to the sub
           generated.  Should be specified as an array reference.

   undefer_sub
        my $coderef = undefer_sub \&Foo::name;

       If the passed coderef has been deferred this will "undefer" it.  If the
       passed coderef has not been deferred, this will just return it.

       If this is confusing, take a look at the example in the "SYNOPSIS".

       Exported by default.

   defer_info
        my $data = defer_info $sub;
        my ($name, $generator, $options, $undeferred_sub) = @$data;

       Returns original arguments to defer_sub, plus the undeferred version if
       this sub has already been undeferred.

       Note that $sub can be either the original deferred version or the
       undeferred version for convenience.

       Not exported by default.

   undefer_all
        undefer_all();

       This will undefer all deferred subs in one go.  This can be very useful
       in a forking environment where child processes would each have to
       undefer the same subs.  By calling this just before you start forking
       children you can undefer all currently deferred subs in the parent so
       that the children do not have to do it.  Note this may bake the
       behavior of some subs that were intended to calculate their behavior
       later, so it shouldn't be used midway through a module load or class
       definition.

       Exported by default.

   undefer_package
         undefer_package($package);

       This undefers all deferred subs in a package.

       Not exported by default.
