NAME
       QtFM - desktop independent file manager

SYNOPSIS
       qtfm-tray

DESCRIPTION
       A system tray daemon for QtFM used to manage removable devices and
       actions related to that.


              Show available devices in system tray

              Auto mount devices when added (not default)

              Auto play audio CD and video/audio DVD (not default)


       USAGE

       qtfm-tray is an user session daemon and should be started during the
       X11 startup session. If your desktop environment or window manager
       supports XDG auto start then qtfm-tray should automatically start, if
       not you will need to add qtfm-tray to your startup file (check the
       documentation included with your desktop environment or window
       manager).


              In Fluxbox add qtfm-tray & to the ~/.fluxbox/startup file.


              In Openbox add qtfm-tray & to the ~/.config/openbox/autostart
              file.


       Settings can be modified in QtFM (Edit=>Settings=>System Tray).  Auto
       play depends on mime types audio-cdda, audio-dvd and video-dvd in the
       x-content mime category in QtFM (Edit=>Settings=>Mime Types).


FILES
       ~/.config/qtfm6/qtfm6.conf
              Per user configuration file.
