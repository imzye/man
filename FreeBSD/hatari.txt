NAME
       atari-convert-dir - helper for creating Atari compatible disk images

SYNOPSIS
       atari-convert-dir sourcedir targetdir

DESCRIPTION
       Copies directories and files from source directory to target directory
       so that their names are clipped to 8+3 characters in Atari GEMDOS
       compatible way.  Files on a disk image that is created from the
       converted target directory, should work as well as with Hatari GEMDOS
       HD emulation.

       This helper is used directly by atari-hd-image tool and its use is also
       recommended with zip2st tool content (because Mtools mcopy doesn't
       convert long file names correctly for Atari).
