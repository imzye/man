ZPOOL-EXPORT(8)         FreeBSD System Manager's Manual        ZPOOL-EXPORT(8)

NAME
     zpool-export – export ZFS storage pools

SYNOPSIS
     zpool export [-f] -a|pool…

DESCRIPTION
     Exports the given pools from the system.  All devices are marked as
     exported, but are still considered in use by other subsystems.  The
     devices can be moved between systems (even those of different endianness)
     and imported as long as a sufficient number of devices are present.

     Before exporting the pool, all datasets within the pool are unmounted.  A
     pool can not be exported if it has a shared spare that is currently being
     used.

     For pools to be portable, you must give the zpool command whole disks,
     not just partitions, so that ZFS can label the disks with portable EFI
     labels.  Otherwise, disk drivers on platforms of different endianness
     will not recognize the disks.

     -a      Exports all pools imported on the system.

     -f      Forcefully unmount all datasets, and allow export of pools with
             active shared spares.

             This command will forcefully export the pool even if it has a
             shared spare that is currently being used.  This may lead to
             potential data corruption.
