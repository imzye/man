NAME
       Crypt::Lite - Easy to use symmetric data encryption and decryption

SYNOPSIS
       use Crypt::Lite;

       $crypt = Crypt::Lite->new( debug => 0 );

       [or]

       $crypt = Crypt::Lite->new( debug => 0, encoding => 'hex8' );

   Encryption
       $encrypted = $crypt->encrypt('plain text to encrypt',
       'your_secret_string');

   Decryption
       $decrypted = $crypt->decrypt($encrypted, 'your_secret_string');

       Returns an empty string if the encrypted hash has been broken

DESCRIPTION
   Important Notice
       Crypt::Lite does "NOT" strong encryption - that's what the "Lite"
       stands for. It's very easy to install and use, anwhere where Perl runs.
       Please take a closer look on AES or Blowfish for strong encryption.

   What's Special
       Crypt::Lite returns an empty string if the passphrase does not exactly
       match. Especially block ciphers often return a partial plain text even
       if, let's say about 90 % of the passphrase was correct (this will not
       say it's more secure - it's a property ;-).

   Introduction
       Sometimes it's necessary to protect some certain data against plain
       reading or you intend to send information through the Internet. Another
       reason might be to assure users cannot modify their previously entered
       data in a follow-up step of a long Web transaction where you don't want
       to deal with server-side session data. The goal of Crypt::Lite was to
       have a pretty simple way to encrypt and decrypt data without the need
       to install and compile huge packages with lots of dependencies.

       Crypt::Lite has the property that it typically returns an empty string
       on a wrong passphrase instead of a partially decrpyted string. It
       generates every time a different encrypted hash when you re-encrypt the
       same data with the same secret string. In normal cases of XOR
       encryption, what Crypt::Lite is based on, double or tripple encryption
       does NOT increase the security. Because of the nature of Crypt::Lite I
       state (because of the shifting concept) double encryption *does*
       increase the challenge to decrypt it. Nevertheless I *don't* recommend
       it because at least it creates very large strings ;-) What I really
       suggest is to use good passphrases not shorter than 6 characters, or
       better 16 characters length to encrypt. A randomly generated passphrase
       that is used only once of the same length as the plain text will be the
       most secure encryption with Crypt::Lite.

       In general, decryption works also on hashes that have been encrypted on
       a foreign host (try this with an unpatched IDEA installation ;-).

       Since last time has grown a harshly thread about XOR encryption I
       suggest to take a look from time to time on this URL to get the latest
       news and documentation on
