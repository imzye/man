DEVICE_SET_DESC(9)     FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual    DEVICE_SET_DESC(9)

NAME
     device_set_desc, device_set_desc_copy, device_get_desc – access the
     description of a device

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <sys/bus.h>

     void
     device_set_desc(device_t dev, const char *desc);

     void
     device_set_desc_copy(device_t dev, const char *desc);

     const char *
     device_get_desc(device_t dev);

DESCRIPTION
     Manipulate the verbose description of a device.  This description (if
     present) is printed as part of the message when it is attached during
     autoconfiguration.  The variation device_set_desc_copy() is used to set
     the description if the string passed is a temporary buffer which will be
     overwritten.  In this case, the system will copy the string, otherwise
     the pointer passed will be used directly.
