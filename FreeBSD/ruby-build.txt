RUBY-BUILD(1)                  ruby-build Manual                 RUBY-BUILD(1)

NAME
       ruby-build - Download, compile, and install a version of Ruby

SYNOPSIS
       ruby-build [-dvpk] <definition> <prefix> [-- <configure-args>...]
       ruby-build {--list|--definitions}
       ruby-build --version

DESCRIPTION
       ruby-build downloads, compiles, and installs a Ruby version named by
       the definition argument into the location specified by prefix.

       The definition argument can optionally start with "ruby-", in which
       case it resolves to a CRuby that matches the version number that
       follows.

       The definition argument can be a path to a file on disk, in which case
       it is sourced into ruby-build as a bash script.

       Optionally, extra Ruby configure-args may be listed after "--" and will
       get forwarded to the ./configure invocation.

       By default, all compile output is redirected to a log file at
       $TMPDIR/ruby-build.*.log. Activate the verbose mode to skip the log
       file and print everything to standard streams.

OPTIONS
       -l, --list
           List latest stable releases for each Ruby

       --definitions
           List all local definitions, including outdated ones

       --version
           Show version of ruby-build

       -d, --dir
           Install the Ruby in the prefix/definition destination instead of
           directly in prefix

       -v, --verbose
           Verbose mode: forward all build output to stdout/stderr

       -p, --patch
           Apply a patch from stdin before building

       -k, --keep
           Do not remove source tree after installation

       -4, --ipv4
           Resolve names to IPv4 addresses only

       -6, --ipv6
           Resolve names to IPv6 addresses only

EXAMPLES
       Install a Ruby version while tweaking some configuration options:

           $ ruby-build 3.2.2 /path/to/destination -- --disable-install-doc --with-openssl-dir=/opt/openssl

       Install a Ruby version to ~/.rubies/ruby-3.2.2:

           $ ruby-build --dir ruby-3.2.2 ~/.rubies

       Install a Ruby version to ~/.rbenv/versions/3.3.5:

           $ ruby-build --dir 3.3.5 ~/.rbenv/versions

       Usage as rbenv plugin, accomplishes the same as the previous example:

           $ rbenv install 3.3.5
