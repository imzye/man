NAME
       Acme::Comment

SYNOPSIS
           use Acme::Comment type=>'C++', own_line=>1;

           /*
           if (ref $mod) {
               $bar->{do}->blat(msg => 'blarg');
               eval {

           i'm sooo sick of this time for some coffee

           */

           // I prefer beer.  --sqrn

DESCRIPTION
       Acme::Comment allows multi-line comments which are filtered out.
       Unlike the pseudo multi-line comment "if (0) {}", the code being
       commented out need not be syntactically valid.

USE
       Acme::Comment contains several different commenting styles.

       Styles may be specified by the "types" argument, or by "start" and
       "end" and manipulated with "own_line" and "one_line".

       Styles may contain multi-line comments and single-line comments.  Perl,
       for example, has single-line comments in the form of "#".

       C, on the other hand, has multi-line comments which begin with "/*" and
       end with "*/".

       With multi-line comments, leaving out a begin or an end comment will
       cause an error.

       Both types of comments may only be preceded on a line by whitespace.

   own_line
       By default, "own_line" is true, which means that multi-line comments
       may not be followed by any characters other than whitespace on the same
       line.  This is the safest option if you think your code may contain the
       comment characters (perhaps in a regex).  If you disable it, other
       characters are allowed on the line after the starting delimiter, but
       these characters will be ignored.  The closing delimiter cannot be
       followed by any other characters.

       Thus, in the following example, $foo would be set to 1.

           /* This is my real comment.
           */
           $foo = 1;

       If you wish to change this option, you must specify either a "type" or
       "start" and "end".

   one_line
       By default, this is set to false, which means that multi-line comments
       may not end on the same line in which they begin.  Turning this on
       allows the following syntax:

           /* comment */

       If you wish to change this option, you must specify either a "type" or
       "start" and "end".

   "start" and "end"
       The "start" and "end" arguments allow you to supply your own commenting
       pattern instead of one of the ones available with "type".  It is not
       valid to provide the same pattern for both "start" and "end".

       You cannot specify both "type" and "start" and "end", and "start" and
       "end" must both be provided if you provide one of them.

   types
       The "types" argument specifies what language style should be used.
       Only one language style may be specified.

       •   Ada

           Single-line comments begin with "'".

       •   Advsys

           Advsys single-line comments begin with ";".

       •   Alan

           Single-line comments start with "--".

       •   Algol

           Multi-line comments begin with 'comment' and end with ";".

           NOTE: You should not use Algol with "own_line" set to 0: The source
           filter will take a ";" to be an ending tag for your comments,
           regardless of where it is.

       •   AWK

           Single-line comments use "#".

       •   B

       •   C

           The default for Acme::Comment is C-style multi-line commenting with
           "/*" and "*/".  However, if you wish to change "one_line" or
           "own_line", you must explicitly specify the type.

           C++ multi-line style uses "/*" and "*/".  Single-line uses "//".

           Multi-line comments begin with "!\" and end with "\!".  Single-line
           comments are not implemented due to their similarity with multi-
           line comments.

CAVEATS
       Because of the way source filters work, it is not possible to eval code
       containing comments and have them correctly removed.

NOTE
       Some of these programming languages may be spelled incorrectly, or may
       have the wrong quote characters noted.  The majority of this
       information was found by searches for language specifications.

       So please report errors, as well as obscure commenting syntax you know
       of.
