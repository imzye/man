ZFS-CLONE(8)            FreeBSD System Manager's Manual           ZFS-CLONE(8)

NAME
     zfs-clone – clone snapshot of ZFS dataset

SYNOPSIS
     zfs clone [-p] [-o property=value]… snapshot filesystem|volume

DESCRIPTION
     See the Clones section of zfsconcepts(7) for details.  The target dataset
     can be located anywhere in the ZFS hierarchy, and is created as the same
     type as the original.

     -o property=value
             Sets the specified property; see zfs create for details.

     -p      Creates all the non-existing parent datasets.  Datasets created
             in this manner are automatically mounted according to the
             mountpoint property inherited from their parent.  If the target
             filesystem or volume already exists, the operation completes
             successfully.
