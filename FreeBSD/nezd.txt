DESCRIPTION
       Nezd is a general-purpose messaging and notification program for X11,
       desigend to be scriptable in any language and integrate well with
       window managers like dwm, wmii and xmonad though it will work with any
       windowmanger.

       Nezd expects the status message on its standard input, and uses a
       custom formatting language for colors and several other features (like
       bar meters and such). See README for detailed usage and scripting
       instructions.
