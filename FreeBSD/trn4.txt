PNEWS(1)                FreeBSD General Commands Manual               PNEWS(1)


NAME
       Pnews - a program for posting news articles

SYNOPSIS
       Pnews newsgroup title
         or
       Pnews -h headerfile [oldarticle]
         or
       Pnews

DESCRIPTION
       Pnews is a friendly interface for posting news articles.  It will ask
       several questions, then allow you to enter your article, and then post
       it using the inews(1) program.  If you type h and a carriage return at
       any point, Pnews will tell you what it wants to know.

       If you put a .signature file in your home directory, your inews program
       will usually append it to your message after you are done editing it.
       If you prefer to see your signature while you are editing, rename your
       .signature file to be .news_sig and it will be appended before you
       begin to edit.  Note that .news_sig obeys the setting of DOTDIR, but
       .signature may not, since it is out of Pnews's control.  If both
       .news_sig and .signature exist you'll get two signatures appended.

       The -h form is used when invoked from trn or rn.  If your editor can
       edit multiple files, and you want the article to which you are replying
       to show up as an alternate file, define the environment variable
       NEWSPOSTER as "Pnews -h %h %A".  You can also modify the the NEWSHEADER
       environment variable to change the header file that [t]rn passes to
       Pnews.

ENVIRONMENT
       AUTHORCOPY
               If defined, contains the name of a file to which the finished
               article will be appended.

               Default: article not saved

       DOTDIR  Where to find your dot files, if they aren't in your home
               directory.  This is primarily for accounts which are shared by
               more than one person.

               Default: $HOME

       EDITOR  The editor you want to use, if VISUAL is undefined.

               Default: whatever your news administrator installed, usually
               vi.

       HOME    Your home directory.

               Default: $LOGDIR

       LOGDIR  Your home directory if HOME is undefined.

       LOGNAME Your login name, if USER is undefined.

               Default: value of "whoami".

       NEWSORG Either the name of your organization, or the name of a file
               containing the name of your organization. (For use at
               organizations where the ORGANIZATION environmental variable is
               in use for other purposes). If both NEWSORG and ORGANIZATION
               are set, NEWSORG will override ORGANIZATION.

       ORGANIZATION
               Either the name of your organization, or the name of a file
               containing the name of your organization.

               Default: whatever your news administrator chose.

       REPLYTO The contents of a "Reply-To:" header line to insert into your
               message.

               Default: header line not inserted.

       USER    Your login name.

               Default: $LOGNAME

BUGS
       Not the speediest program in the world, but maybe that's a blessing to
       the net.
