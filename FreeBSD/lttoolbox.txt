LT-APPEND(1)            FreeBSD General Commands Manual           LT-APPEND(1)

NAME
     lt-append – combine two compiled dictionary transducers

SYNOPSIS
     lt-append input_a input_b output

DESCRIPTION
     lt-append will combine two compiled dictionaries as if they had been
     compiled from one big XML file, keeping sections separate. If input_a has
     sections “main” and “final” and input_b has section “regex” then output
     will have sections “main”, “final” and “regex” (there is no cross-section
     minimisation, so internally there is no union, but the behaviour of
     running the transducer will be as if we had done the union).

FILES
     input_transducer_a
             The first input binary (a finite state transducer).

     input_transducer_b
             The second input binary (a finite state transducer).

     output_transducer
             The output binary with the combination of inputs (a finite state
             transducer).
