File::ShareDir::Tiny(3)                    User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       File::ShareDir::Tiny - Locate per-dist and per-module shared files

VERSION
       version 0.001

SYNOPSIS
         use File::ShareDir::Tiny ':ALL';

         # Where are distribution-level shared data files kept
         $dir = dist_dir('File-ShareDir-Tiny');

         # Where are module-level shared data files kept
         $dir = module_dir('File::ShareDir::Tiny');

         # Find a specific file in our dist/module shared dir
         $file = dist_file('File-ShareDir-Tiny',  'file/name.txt');
         $file = module_file('File::ShareDir::Tiny', 'file/name.txt');

DESCRIPTION
       Quite often you want or need your Perl module (CPAN or otherwise) to
       have access to a large amount of read-only data that is stored on the
       file-system at run-time.

       On a linux-like system, this would be in a place such as /usr/share,
       however Perl runs on a wide variety of different systems, and so the
       use of any one location is unreliable.

       This module provides a more portable way to have (read-only) data for
       your module.

   Using Data in your Module
       "File::ShareDir::Tiny" forms one half of a two part solution.  Once the
       files have been installed to the correct directory, you can use
       "File::ShareDir::Tiny" to find your files again after the installation.

       For the installation half of the solution, there are several options
       available that depend on your installation tool. For
       ExtUtils::MakeMaker There is File::ShareDir::Install. Other tools like
       Module::Build, Module::Build::Tiny and Dist::Build have built in
       support for sharedirs.

FUNCTIONS
       "File::ShareDir::Tiny" provides four functions for locating files and
       directories.

       For greater maintainability, none of these are exported by default and
       you are expected to name the ones you want at use-time, or provide the
       ':ALL' tag. All of the following are equivalent.

         # Load but don't import, and then call directly
         use File::ShareDir::Tiny;
         $dir = File::ShareDir::Tiny::dist_dir('My-Dist');

         # Import a single function
         use File::ShareDir::Tiny 'dist_dir';
         dist_dir('My-Dist');

         # Import all the functions
         use File::ShareDir::Tiny ':ALL';
         dist_dir('My-Dist');

       All of the functions will check for you that the dir/file actually
       exists, and that you have read permissions, or they will throw an
       exception.

   dist_dir
         # Get a distribution's shared files directory
         my $dir = dist_dir('My-Distribution');

       The "dist_dir" function takes a single parameter of the name of an
       installed (CPAN or otherwise) distribution, and locates the shared data
       directory created at install time for it.

       Returns the directory path as a string, or dies if it cannot be located
       or is not readable.

   module_dir
         # Get a module's shared files directory
         my $dir = module_dir('My::Module');

       The "module_dir" function takes a single parameter of the name of an
       installed (CPAN or otherwise) module, and locates the shared data
       directory created at install time for it.

       Note that unlike File::ShareDir the module does not have be loaded when
       calling this function.

       Returns the directory path as a string, or dies if it cannot be located
       or is not readable.

   dist_file
         # Find a file in our distribution shared dir
         my $dir = dist_file('My-Distribution', 'file/name.txt');

       The "dist_file" function takes two parameters of the distribution name
       and file name, locates the dist directory, and then finds the file
       within it, verifying that the file actually exists, and that it is
       readable.

       The filename should be a relative path in the format of your local
       filesystem. It will simply added to the directory using File::Spec's
       "catfile" method.

       Returns the file path as a string, or dies if the file or the dist's
       directory cannot be located, or the file is not readable.

   module_file
         # Find a file in our module shared dir
         my $dir = module_file('My::Module', 'file/name.txt');

       The "module_file" function takes two parameters of the module name and
       file name. It locates the module directory, and then finds the file
       within it, verifying that the file actually exists, and that it is
       readable.

       In order to find the directory, the module must be loaded when calling
       this function.

       The filename should be a relative path in the format of your local
       filesystem. It will simply added to the directory using File::Spec's
       "catfile" method.

       Returns the file path as a string, or dies if the file or the dist's
       directory cannot be located, or the file is not readable.
