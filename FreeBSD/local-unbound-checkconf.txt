NAME
       local-unbound-checkconf - Check local-unbound configuration file for
       errors.

SYNOPSIS
       local-unbound-checkconf [-h] [-f] [-o option] [cfgfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Local-unbound-checkconf checks the configuration file for the local-
       unbound(8) DNS resolver for syntax and other errors.  The config file
       syntax is described in unbound.conf(5).

       The available options are:

       -h     Show the version and commandline option help.

       -f     Print full pathname, with chroot applied to it.  Use with the -o
              option.

       -o option
              If given, after checking the config file the value of this
              option is printed to stdout.  For "" (disabled) options an empty
              line is printed.

       cfgfile
              The config file to read with settings for unbound. It is
              checked.  If omitted, the config file at the default location is
              checked.

EXIT CODE
       The local-unbound-checkconf program exits with status code 1 on error,
       0 for a correct config file.
