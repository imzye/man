NAME
       linrename - rename files

SYNOPSIS
       linrename [options] expression replacement file...

DESCRIPTION
       linrename will rename the specified files by replacing the first
       occurrence of expression in their name by replacement.

OPTIONS
       -v, --verbose
              Give visual feedback which files where renamed, if any.

       -V, --version
              Display version information and exit.

       -s, --symlink
              Peform rename on symlink target

       -h, --help
              Display help text and exit.

EXAMPLES
       Given the files foo1, ..., foo9, foo10, ..., foo278, the commands

              linrename foo foo0 foo?
              linrename foo foo0 foo??

       will turn them into foo001, ..., foo009, foo010, ..., foo278.  And

              linrename .htm .html *.htm

       will fix the extension of your html files.

WARNING
       The renaming has no safeguards.  If the user has permission to rewrite
       file names, the command will perform the action without any questions.
       For example, the result can be quite drastic when the command is run as
       root in the /lib directory.  Always make a backup before running the
       command, unless you truly know what you are doing.
