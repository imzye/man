ZFS-LIST(8)             FreeBSD System Manager's Manual            ZFS-LIST(8)

NAME
     zfs-list – list properties of ZFS datasets

SYNOPSIS
     zfs list [-r|-d depth] [-Hp] [-o property[,property]…] [-s property]…
         [-S property]… [-t type[,type]…] [filesystem|volume|snapshot]…

DESCRIPTION
     If specified, you can list property information by the absolute pathname
     or the relative pathname.  By default, all file systems and volumes are
     displayed.  Snapshots are displayed if the listsnapshots pool property is
     on (the default is off), or if the -t snapshot or -t all options are
     specified.  The following fields are displayed: name, used, available,
     referenced, mountpoint.

     -H  Used for scripting mode.  Do not print headers and separate fields by
         a single tab instead of arbitrary white space.

     -S property
         Same as the -s option, but sorts by property in descending order.

     -d depth
         Recursively display any children of the dataset, limiting the
         recursion to depth.  A depth of 1 will display only the dataset and
         its direct children.

     -o property
         A comma-separated list of properties to display.  The property must
         be:
         •   One of the properties described in the Native Properties section
             of zfsprops(7)
         •   A user property
         •   The value name to display the dataset name
         •   The value space to display space usage properties on file systems
             and volumes.  This is a shortcut for specifying
             -o name,avail,used,usedsnap,usedds,usedrefreserv,usedchild -t
             filesystem,volume.

     -p  Display numbers in parsable (exact) values.

     -r  Recursively display any children of the dataset on the command line.

     -s property
         A property for sorting the output by column in ascending order based
         on the value of the property.  The property must be one of the
         properties described in the Properties section of zfsprops(7) or the
         value name to sort by the dataset name.  Multiple properties can be
         specified at one time using multiple -s property options.  Multiple
         -s options are evaluated from left to right in decreasing order of
         importance.  The following is a list of sorting criteria:
         •   Numeric types sort in numeric order.
         •   String types sort in alphabetical order.
         •   Types inappropriate for a row sort that row to the literal
             bottom, regardless of the specified ordering.

         If no sorting options are specified the existing behavior of zfs list
         is preserved.

     -t type
         A comma-separated list of types to display, where type is one of
         filesystem, snapshot, volume, bookmark, or all.  For example,
         specifying -t snapshot displays only snapshots.
