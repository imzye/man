NAME
       List::Cycle - Objects for cycling through a list of values

VERSION
       Version 1.04

SYNOPSIS
       List::Cycle gives you an iterator object for cycling through a series
       of values.  The canonical use is for cycling through a list of colors
       for alternating bands of color on a report.

           use List::Cycle;

           my $colors = List::Cycle->new( {values => ['#000000', '#FAFAFA', '#BADDAD']} );
           print $colors->next; # #000000
           print $colors->next; # #FAFAFA
           print $colors->next; # #BADDAD
           print $colors->next; # #000000
           print $colors->next; # #FAFAFA
           ... etc ...

       You'd call it at the top of a loop:

           while ( ... ) {
               my $color = $colors->next;
               print qq{<tr bgcolor="$color">;
               ...
           }

       Note that a List::Cycle object is not a standard Perl blessed hash.
       It's an inside-out object, as suggested in Perl Best Practices.  In the
       seven years since PBP has come out, inside-out objects have been almost
       universally ignored, but I keep List::Cycle as an example.  If you
       don't care about the internals of the object, then List::Cycle is a
       fine module for you to use.

FUNCTIONS
   new( {values => \@values} )
       Creates a new cycle object, using @values.

       The "values" keyword can be "vals", if you like.

   "$cycle->set_values(\@values)"
       Sets the cycle values and resets the internal pointer.

   $cycle->reset
       Sets the internal pointer back to the beginning of the cycle.

           my $color = List::Cycle->new( {values => [qw(red white blue)]} );
           print $color->next; # red
           print $color->next; # white
           $color->reset;
           print $color->next; # red, not blue

   $cycle->dump
       Returns a handy string representation of internals.

   $cycle->next
       Gives the next value in the sequence.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
       List::Cycle is a playground that uses some of the ideas in Damian
       Conway's marvelous Perl Best Practices.
       <http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/perlbp/> One of the chapters mentions a
       mythical List::Cycle module, so I made it real.

       Thanks also to Ricardo SIGNES and Todd Rinaldo for patches.
