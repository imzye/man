Heap::Simple::Perl(3)                      User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Heap::Simple::Perl - A pure perl implementation of the Heap::Simple
       interface

SYNOPSIS
           # Let Heap::Simple decide which implementation that provides its interface
           # it will load and use. This may be Heap::Simple::Perl or it may not be.
           # Still, this is the normal way of using Heap::Simple
           use Heap::Simple;
           my $heap = Heap::Simple->new(...);
           # Use heap as described in the Heap::Simple documentation

           # If for some reason you insist on using this version:
           use Heap::Simple::Perl;
           my $heap = Heap::Simple::Perl->new(...);
           # Use the pure perl heap as described in the Heap::Simple documentation

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a pure perl implementation of the interface
       described in Heap::Simple. Look there for a description.

NOTES
       •   The dirty option has no effect. This heap type doesn't currently do
           any potentially unsafe optimizations.

       •   Heap::Simple->implementation will return "Heap::Simple::Perl" if it
           selected this module.

EXPORT
       None.
