PWAIT(1)                FreeBSD General Commands Manual               PWAIT(1)

NAME
     pwait – wait for processes to terminate

SYNOPSIS
     pwait [-t duration] [-v] pid ...

DESCRIPTION
     The pwait utility will wait until each of the given processes has
     terminated.

     The following option is available:

     -t duration
             If any process is still running after duration, pwait will exit.
             The duration value can be integer or decimal numbers.  Values
             without unit symbols are interpreted as seconds.

             Supported unit symbols are:
             s       seconds
             m       minutes
             h       hours

     -v      Print the exit status when each process terminates.

EXIT STATUS
     The pwait utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

     If the -t flag is specified and a timeout occurs, the exit status will be
     124.

     Invalid pids elicit a warning message but are otherwise ignored.

SEE ALSO
     kill(1), pkill(1), ps(1), wait(1), kqueue(2)

NOTES
     pwait is not a substitute for the wait(1) builtin as it will not clean up
     any zombies or state in the parent process.

HISTORY
     A pwait command first appeared in SunOS 5.8.
