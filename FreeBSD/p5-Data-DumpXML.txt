NAME
       Data::DumpXML - Dump arbitrary data structures as XML

SYNOPSIS
        use Data::DumpXML qw(dump_xml);
        $xml = dump_xml(@list)

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a single function called dump_xml() that takes a
       list of Perl values as its argument and produces a string as its
       result.  The string returned is an XML document that represents any
       Perl data structures passed to the function.  Reference loops are
       handled correctly.

       The following data model is used:

          data : scalar*
          scalar = undef | str | ref | alias
          ref : scalar | array | hash | glob | code
          array: scalar*
          hash: (key scalar)*

       The distribution comes with an XML schema and a DTD that more formally
       describe this structure.

       As an example of the XML documents produced, the following call:

         $a = bless [1,2], "Foo";
         dump_xml($a);

       produces:

         <?xml version="1.0" encoding="US-ASCII"?>
         <data xmlns="http://www.cpan.org/.../Data-DumpXML.xsd">
          <ref>
           <array class="Foo">
            <str>1</str>
            <str>2</str>
           </array>
          </ref>
         </data>

       If dump_xml() is called in a void context, then the dump is printed on
       STDERR automatically.  For compatibility with "Data::Dump", there is
       also an alias for dump_xml() called simply dump().

       "Data::DumpXML::Parser" is a class that can restore data structures
       dumped by dump_xml().

   Configuration variables
       The generated XML is influenced by a set of configuration variables.
       If you modify them, then it is a good idea to localize the effect. For
       example:

         sub my_dump_xml {
             local $Data::DumpXML::INDENT = "";
             local $Data::DumpXML::XML_DECL = 0;
             local $Data::DumpXML::DTD_LOCATION = "";
             local $Data::DumpXML::NS_PREFIX = "dumpxml";

             return dump_xml(@_);
         }

       The variables are:

       $Data::DumpXML::INDENT
           You can set the variable $Data::DumpXML::INDENT to control the
           amount of indenting.  The variable contains the whitespace you want
           to be used for each level of indenting.  The default is a single
           space.  To suppress indenting, set it to "".

       $Data::DumpXML::INDENT_STYLE
           This variable controls where end element are placed.  If you set
           this variable to the value "Lisp" then end tags are not prefixed by
           NL.  This give a more compact output.

       $Data::DumpXML::XML_DECL
           This boolean variable controls whether an XML declaration should be
           prefixed to the output.  The XML declaration is the <?xml ...?>
           thingy.  The default is 1.  Set this value to 0 to suppress the
           declaration.

       $Data::DumpXML::NAMESPACE
           This variable contains the namespace used for the XML elements.
           The default is to let this be a URI that actually resolve to the
           XML schema on CPAN.  Set it to "" to disable use of namespaces.

       $Data::DumpXML::NS_PREFIX
           This variable contains the namespace prefix to use on the elements.
           The default is "", which means that a default namespace will be
           declared.

       $Data::DumpXML::SCHEMA_LOCATION
           This variable contains the location of the XML schema.  If this
           variable is non-empty, then an "xsi:schemaLocation" attribute is
           added to the top level "data" element.  The default is not to
           include this, as the location can be inferred from the default XML
           namespace used.

       $Data::DumpXML::DTD_LOCATION
           This variable contains the location of the DTD.  If this variable
           is non-empty, then a <!DOCTYPE ...> is included in the output.  The
           default is to point to the DTD on CPAN.  Set it to "" to suppress
           the <!DOCTYPE ...> line.

BUGS
       Class names with 8-bit characters are dumped as Latin-1, but converted
       to UTF-8 when restored by the Data::DumpXML::Parser.

       The content of globs and subroutines are not dumped.  They are restored
       as the strings "** glob **" and "** code **".

       LVALUE and IO objects are not dumped at all.  They simply disappear
       from the restored data structure.
