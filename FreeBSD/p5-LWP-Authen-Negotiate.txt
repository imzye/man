LWP::Authen::Negotiate(3)                  User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       LWP::Authen::Negotiate - GSSAPI based Authentication Plugin for LWP

SYNOPSIS
          #! /usr/bin/perl -w

          use strict;
          require LWP::UserAgent;

          # uncomment if you want see what is going wrong messages
          #
          #use LWP::Debug qw(+);

          my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new;
          my $response = $ua->get('http://testwurst.grolmsnet.lan:8090/geheim/');
          if ($response->is_success) {
             print $response->content;  # or whatever
          }
          else {
              die $response->status_line;
          }

       just install LWP::Authen::Negotiate, LWP uses it as authentication
       plugin.  Use your LWP::UserAgent Scripts as usual.  Authentication is
       done transparent based on your GSSAPI installation (MIT Kerberos or
       Heimdal)

       WWW-Negotiate Webservers are IIS or Apache with mod_auth_kerb for
       example.

DESCRIPTION
       To see what ist going on add

          use LWP::Debug qw(+);

       to yor LWP using Scripts.

       (e.g. too see what is going wrong with GSSAPI...)

DEBUGGING
       To see what ist going on (and going wrong) add

          use LWP::Debug qw(+);

       to yor LWP using Scripts.

       (e.g. too see what is going wrong with GSSAPI...)

       the output will look like this:

          LWP::UserAgent::new: ()
          LWP::UserAgent::request: ()
          LWP::UserAgent::send_request: GET http://testwurst.grolmsnet.lan:8090/geheim/
          LWP::UserAgent::_need_proxy: Not proxied
          LWP::Protocol::http::request: ()
          LWP::Protocol::collect: read 478 bytes
          LWP::UserAgent::request: Simple response: Unauthorized
          LWP::Authen::Negotiate::authenticate: authenticate() called
          LWP::Authen::Negotiate::authenticate: target hostname testwurst.grolmsnet.lan
          LWP::Authen::Negotiate::authenticate: GSSAPI servicename     HTTP/moerbsen.grolmsnet.lan@GROLMSNET.LAN
          LWP::Authen::Negotiate::authenticate:  Miscellaneous failure (see text)
          LWP::Authen::Negotiate::authenticate: open(/tmp/krb5cc_1000): file not found

       In this case the credentials cache was empty.  Run kinit first ;-)

ENVIRONMENT
       LWP_AUTHEN_NEGOTIATE_DELEGATE
           Define to enable ticket forwarding to webserver.

BUGS
       As default Kerberos 5 is selected as GSSAPI mechanism.  a later veriosn
       will make that configureable.
