NAME
     logswan – fast Web log analyzer using probabilistic data structures

SYNOPSIS
     logswan [-ghv] [-d db] logfile

DESCRIPTION
     logswan is a fast Web log analyzer using probabilistic data structures.
     It is targeted at very large log files, typically APIs logs.  It has
     constant memory usage regardless of the log file size, and takes
     approximatively 4MB of RAM.

     Unique visitors counting is performed using two HyperLogLog counters (one
     for IPv4, and another one for IPv6), providing a relative accuracy of
     0.10%.

     If file is a single dash (`-'), logswan reads from the standard input.

     The options are as follows:

     -d db   Specify path to a GeoIP database.

     -g      Enable GeoIP lookups.

     -h      Display usage.

     -v      Display version.

EXAMPLES
     The following script can be used to process all log files in the current
     directory and save the output in a file:

           #!/bin/sh
           for file in $(ls *.log)
           do
                   logswan $file > $file.json
           done
           exit 0
