NAME
       File::Sync - Perl access to fsync() and sync() function calls

SYNOPSIS
         use File::Sync qw(fsync sync);
         sync();
         fsync(\*FILEHANDLE) or die "fsync: $!";
         # and if fdatasync() is available on your system:
         fdatasync($fh) or die "fdatasync: $!";

         use File::Sync qw(fsync);
         use FileHandle;
         $fh = new FileHandle("> /tmp/foo")
             or die "new FileHandle: $!";
         ...
         $fh->fsync() or die "fsync: $!";

DESCRIPTION
       The fsync() function takes a Perl file handle as its only argument, and
       passes its fileno() to the C function fsync().  It returns undef on
       failure, or true on success. fdatasync() is identical in return value,
       but it calls C fdatasync() instead of fsync(), synchronizing only the
       data in the file, not the metadata.

       The fsync_fd() function is used internally by fsync(); it takes a file
       descriptor as its only argument.

       The sync() function is identical to the C function sync().

       This module does not export any methods by default, but fsync() is made
       available as a method of the FileHandle class. Note carefully that as
       of 0.11, we no longer clobber anything in IO::Handle. You can replace
       any calls to IO::Handle::fsync() with IO::Handle::sync():

NOTES
       Doing fsync() if the stdio buffers aren't flushed (with $| or the
       autoflush method) is probably pointless.

       Calling sync() too often on a multi-user system is slightly antisocial.
