NAME
     quark – simple static web server

SYNOPSIS
     quark -p port [-h host] [-u user] [-g group] [-s num] [-t num] [-d dir]
           [-l] [-i file] [-v vhost] ... [-m map] ...
     quark -U file [-p port] [-u user] [-g group] [-s num] [-t num] [-d dir]
           [-l] [-i file] [-v vhost] ... [-m map] ...

DESCRIPTION
     quark is a simple HTTP GET/HEAD-only web server for static content.  It
     supports virtual hosts (see -v), explicit redirects (see -m), directory
     listings (see -l), conditional "If-Modified-Since"-requests (RFC 7232),
     range requests (RFC 7233) and well-known URIs (RFC 8615), while refusing
     to serve hidden files and directories.

OPTIONS
     -d dir  Serve dir after chrooting into it.  The default is ".".

     -g group
             Set group ID when dropping privileges, and in socket mode the
             group of the socket file, to the ID of group.  The default is
             "nogroup".

     -h host
             Use host as the server hostname.  The default is the loopback
             interface (i.e. localhost).

     -i file
             Set file as the directory index.  The default is "index.html".

     -l      Enable directory listing.

     -m map  Add the URI prefix mapping rule specified by map, which has the
             form "from to [chost]", where each element is separated with
             spaces (0x20) that can be escaped with '\'.

             The prefix from of all matching URIs is replaced with to,
             optionally limited to the canonical virtual host chost.  If no
             virtual hosts are given, chost is ignored.

     -p port
             In host mode, listen on port port for incoming connections.  In
             socket mode, use port for constructing proper virtual host
             redirects on non-standard ports.

     -U file
             Create the UNIX-domain socket file, listen on it for incoming
             connections and remove it on exit.

     -s num  Set the number of connection slots per worker thread to num.  The
             default is 64.

     -t num  Set the number of worker threads to num.  The default is 4.

     -u user
             Set user ID when dropping privileges, and in socket mode the user
             of the socket file, to the ID of user.  The default is "nobody".

     -v vhost
             Add the virtual host specified by vhost, which has the form
             "chost regex dir [prefix]", where each element is separated with
             spaces (0x20) that can be escaped with '\'.

             A request matching the virtual host regular expression regex (see
             regex(3)) is redirected to the canonical host chost, if they
             differ, using the directory dir as the root directory, optionally
             prefixing the URI with prefix.  If any virtual hosts are
             specified, all requests on non-matching hosts are discarded.

CUSTOMIZATION
     quark can be customized by creating a custom config.h from config.def.h
     and (re)compiling the source code. This keeps it fast, secure and simple.
