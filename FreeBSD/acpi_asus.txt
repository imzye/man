ACPI_ASUS(4)           FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual           ACPI_ASUS(4)

NAME
     acpi_asus – Asus Laptop Extras

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following line in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device acpi_asus

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           acpi_asus_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The acpi_asus driver provides support for the extra ACPI-controlled
     gadgets, such as hotkeys and leds, found on recent Asus (and Medion)
     laptops.  It allows one to use the sysctl(8) interface to manipulate the
     brightness of the LCD panel and the display output state.  Hotkey events
     are passed to devd(8) for easy handling in userspace with the default
     configuration in /etc/devd/asus.conf.

     Currently, the following Asus laptops are fully supported:

           xxN
           A1x
           A2x
           A3N
           A4D
           A6VM
           D1x
           J1x
           L2B
           L2D
           L2E
           L3C
           L3D
           L3H
           L4E
           L4R
           L5x
           L8x
           M1A
           M2E
           M6N
           M6R
           S1x
           S2x
           V6V
           W5A
           Eee PC

     Additionally, acpi_asus also supports the Asus-compatible ATK0100
     interface found in Samsung P30/P35 laptops.

SYSCTL VARIABLES
     The following sysctls are currently implemented:

     hw.acpi.asus.lcd_brightness
             Makes the LCD backlight brighter or dimmer (higher values are
             brighter).

     hw.acpi.asus.lcd_backlight
             Turns the LCD backlight on or off.

     hw.acpi.asus.video_output
             Sets the active display to use according to a bitwise OR of the
             following:

             0       No display
             1       LCD
             2       CRT
             4       TV-Out

             Some models also support video switching via the generic
             acpi_video(4) driver.  Most models do not, however.

     Defaults for these variables can be set in sysctl.conf(5), which is
     parsed at boot-time.

HISTORY
     The acpi_asus driver first appeared in FreeBSD 5.3.

AUTHORS
     The acpi_asus driver and this manual page were written by Philip Paeps
     <philip@FreeBSD.org>.

     Inspiration came from the acpi4asus project started by Julien Lerouge
     which maintains a driver implementing this functionality in the Linux
     kernel.
