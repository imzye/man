NAME
     pst – device driver for Promise Supertrak SX6000

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following line in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device pst

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           pst_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     This driver is for the Promise Supertrak SX6000 ATA hardware RAID
     controller.  It supports (in hardware) RAID levels 0, 1, 0+1, 3, 5 and
     JBOD on up to 6 ATA disk drives, including automatic rebuild and hotswap,
     and supports signalling disk status on LEDs on Promise Superswap disk
     enclosures.  The Supertrak line of controllers does not support non-disk
     devices.

HARDWARE
     The pst driver supports the Promise Supertrak SX6000 ATA hardware RAID
     controller.

NOTES
     The pst driver does not support manipulating the RAID from the OS, RAIDs
     need to be set up from the onboard BIOS.  However, hot swap, hot spare,
     and automatic rebuilds are supported without a reboot.

HISTORY
     The pst driver first appeared in FreeBSD 4.7.

AUTHORS
     The pst driver and man page was written by Søren Schmidt
