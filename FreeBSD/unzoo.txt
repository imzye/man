UNZOO(1)                FreeBSD General Commands Manual               UNZOO(1)

NAME
       unzoo - zoo archive extractor

SYNOPSIS
       unzoo
       unzoo [-l] [-v] <archive>[.zoo] [<file>..]
       unzoo -x [-abnpo] [-j <prefix>] <archive>[.zoo] [<file>..]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the unzoo command.  This manual page
       was written for the Debian distribution because the original program
       does not have a manual page.

       unzoo is a program that lists or extracts the members of a zoo archive.
       A zoo archive is a file that contains several files, called its
       members, usually in compressed form to save space. unzoo can list all
       or selected members or extract all or selected members, i.e.,
       uncompress them and write them to files. It cannot add new members or
       delete members. For this you need the zoo archiver, called zoo, written
       by Rahul Dhesi.

       If you call unzoo with no arguments, it will first print a summary of
       the commands and then prompt for command lines interactively, until you
       enter an empty line.

       Usually unzoo will only list or extract the latest generation of each
       member. But if you append ';<nr>' to a path name pattern the generation
       with the number <nr> is listed or extracted. <nr> itself can contain
       the wildcard characters '?' and '*', so appending ';*' to a path name
       pattern causes all generations to be listed or extracted.


OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       -l     list the members in the archive <archive>. For each member unzoo
              prints the size that the extracted file would have, the
              compression factor, the size that the member occupies in the
              archive (not counting the space needed to store the attributes
              such as the path name of the file), the date and time when the
              files were last modified, and finally the path name itself.
              Finally unzoo prints a grand total for the file sizes, the
              compression factor, and the member sizes.

       <file> list only files matching at least one pattern, '?' matches any
              char, '*' matches any string.

       -v     list also the generation numbers and the comments, where higher
              numbers mean later generations. Members for which generations
              are disabled are listed with  ';0'.

       -x     extract the members from the archive <archive>. Members are
              stored with a full path name in the archive and if the operating
              system supports this, they will be extracted into appropriate
              subdirectories, which will be created on demand.

       -a     extract all members as text files (not only those with !TEXT!
              comments)

       -b     extract all members as binary files (even those with !TEXT!
              comments)

       -n     extract no members, only test the integrity. For each member the
              name is printed followed by '-- tested' if the member is intact
              or by '-- error, CRC failed' if it is not.

       -p     extract to stdout

       -o     extract over existing files without asking for confirmation. The
              default is to ask for confirmation. unzoo will never overwrite
              existing read-only files.

       -j     prepend the string <prefix> to all path names for the members
              before they are extracted. So for example if an archive contains
              absolute path names under UNIX, '-j ./' can be used to convert
              them to relative pathnames.  Note that the directory <prefix>
              must exist, unzoo will not create it on demand.
