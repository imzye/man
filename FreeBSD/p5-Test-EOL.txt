NAME
       Test::EOL - Check the correct line endings in your project

SYNOPSIS
       "Test::EOL" lets you check for the presence of trailing whitespace
       and/or windows line endings in your perl code. It reports its results
       in standard "Test::Simple" fashion:

         use Test::EOL tests => 1;
         eol_unix_ok( 'lib/Module.pm', 'Module is ^M free');

       and to add checks for trailing whitespace:

         use Test::EOL tests => 1;
         eol_unix_ok( 'lib/Module.pm', 'Module is ^M and trailing whitespace free', { trailing_whitespace => 1 });

       Module authors can include the following in a t/eol.t and have
       "Test::EOL" automatically find and check all perl files in a module
       distribution:

         use Test::EOL;
         all_perl_files_ok();

       or

         use Test::EOL;
         all_perl_files_ok( @mydirs );

       and if authors would like to check for trailing whitespace:

         use Test::EOL;
         all_perl_files_ok({ trailing_whitespace => 1 });

       or

         use Test::EOL;
         all_perl_files_ok({ trailing_whitespace => 1 }, @mydirs );

DESCRIPTION
       This module scans your project/distribution for any perl files
       (scripts, modules, etc) for the presence of windows line endings.

FUNCTIONS
   all_perl_files_ok
         all_perl_files_ok( [ \%options ], [ @directories ] )

       Applies eol_unix_ok() to all perl files found in @directories (and sub
       directories). If no <@directories> is given, the starting point is one
       level above the current running script, that should cover all the files
       of a typical CPAN distribution. A perl file is *.pl or *.pm or *.t or a
       file starting with "#!...perl"

       Valid "\%options" currently are:

       •   trailing_whitespace

           By default Test::EOL only looks for Windows (CR/LF) line-endings.
           Set this to true to raise errors if any kind of trailing whitespace
           is present in the file.

       •   all_reasons

           Normally Test::EOL reports only the first error in every file
           (given that a text file originated on Windows will fail every
           single line). Set this a true value to register a test failure for
           every line with an error.

       If the test plan is defined:

         use Test::EOL tests => 3;
         all_perl_files_ok();

       the total number of files tested must be specified.

   eol_unix_ok
         eol_unix_ok ( $file [, $text] [, \%options ] )

       Run a unix EOL check on $file. For a module, the path
       (lib/My/Module.pm) or the name (My::Module) can be both used. $text is
       the diagnostic label emited after the "ok"/"not ok" TAP output.
       "\%options" takes the same values as described in "all_perl_files_ok".

EXPORT

       if you don't export anything, such as for a purely object-oriented
       module.
