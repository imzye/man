CF(1)                   FreeBSD General Commands Manual                  CF(1)

NAME
       cf - unix time to formated time and date filter

SYNOPSIS
       cf [-f fmt] [-lpsu] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This filter reads the named files (or from stdin if there are none) and
       replaces numeric timestamps found at the beginning of each line with a
       formated time and date time and date. For example:

              % echo '1074558944 default format' | cf
              Jan 19 16:35:44 default format

       The CFTIMEARGS environment variable can be used to specify a default
       set of flags.  However, this is only honored if no flags are specified
       on the command line. Also, the only escapes recognized are ', " and \.

OPTIONS
       -f fmt Specify a strftime(1) format string. For example:

                     % echo '1074558944 custom format' | cf -f %F-%T
                     2004-01-19-16:35:44 custom format

              Using an empty format causes cf to revert to its default format
              ("%b %e %T").

       -l     Use the long format which appends the year ("%Y"). For example:

                     % echo '1074558944 long format' | cf -l
                     Jan 19 16:35:44 2004 long format

       -p     Preserve sub-second timestamp info. For example:

                     % echo '1100980501.867105 preserve format' | cf -p
                     Nov 20 11:55:01.867105 preserve format

       -s     Do strict checking of the timestamp. The number is only
              considered to be a valid timestamp and converted if it 9 or more
              characters long and contains one or less dots.

       -u     Format using UTC (Coordinated Universal) instead of local time.
