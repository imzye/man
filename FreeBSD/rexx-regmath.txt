NAME
     regmath – Mathematics libraries for Regina REXX interpreter

DESCRIPTION
     regmath consists of two separate collections of utility functions for use
     with the Regina REXX interpreter.  These closely mirror the functions
     contained in the RxMath library provided on IBM systems, and the RexxMath
     library provided for use with Amiga Rexx.  As it stands, the regmath
     collections will not work with another REXX interpreter.

     Details of usage are in the full manual, which is normally found at:
     /usr/local/share/doc/regmath/regmath.pdf (if installed).
