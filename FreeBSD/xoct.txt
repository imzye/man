DESCRIPTION
       The original puzzle has 9 triangles per face (size = 3) and has period
       4 turning (i.e. the face or points turn with 90 degree intervals).  The
       puzzle was designed by Uwe Meffert and called the Magic Octahedron (or
       Star Puzzler).  The puzzle was not widely distributed but not exactly
       rare.  This puzzle has some analogies to the Rubik's Cube and the
       solving techniques are the same to that of the Pyraminx.  Christoph's
       Magic Jewel is similar except there are no trivial corners to solve.
       This has 2^22*12! or 2,009,078,326,886,400 different combinations.

       Uwe Meffert also noticed that there could be an alternate twisting for
       the octahedron where it has period 3 turning (i.e. faces turn with 120
       degree intervals).

       One is able to simulate a Trajber's Octahedron (period 3 turning and
       sticky mode).  Also one is able to simulate one with variant turning
       (period 4 turning and sticky mode).

FEATURES
       Press "mouse-left" button to move a piece.  Release "mouse-left" button
       on a piece on the same face and in the same row (but not an adjacent
       piece or the move is ambiguous).  The pieces will then turn towards
       where the mouse button was released.

       Press "mouse-center", or press "P" or "p" keys to toggle the practice
       mode (in practice mode the record should say "practice").  One must
       double click on "mouse-center" if the puzzle is being worked on.  This
       is good for learning moves and experimenting.

       Click "mouse-right", or press "R" or "r" keys to randomize (this must
       be done first to set a new record).  One must double click on "mouse-
       right" if the puzzle is being worked on.

       Press "I" or "i" keys to increase the number of "octas".

       Press "D" or "d" keys to decrease the number of "octas".

       Press "O" or "o" keys to toggle the orient mode.  One has to orient the
       faces in orient mode, besides getting all the faces to be the same
       color.  To do this one has to get the lines to be oriented in the same
       direction, this only matters with center "octas", if at all (i.e.
       those "octas" not on a corner or edge).  This does add complexity so
       there are 2 sets of records.

       Press "3", "4", "B", or "b" keys (not the keypad 3, 4) to change modes
       to Period 3, Period 4, or Both.

       Press "Y" or "y" to toggle sticky mode (increase/decrease is disabled
       here if sticky mode is on).
       "Sticky" and "Period 3" turning allows only the faces to turn.  It is
       as if the middle cut of the three cuts did not exist.
       "Sticky" and "Period 4" turning allows only the points to turn, it is
       as if the middle cut of the three cuts did not exist.
       Beware, the "Sticky" mode is a hack and much could be done to improve
       its look.

       "S" or "s" keys reserved for the auto-solver (unimplemented).

       Press "U" or "u" keys to undo move.

       Press "G" or "g" keys to get a saved puzzle.

       Press "W" or "w" keys to write or save a puzzle.

       Press "Q", "q", or "CTRL-C" keys to kill program.

       Use the key pad, "R" keys, or arrow keys to move without mouse clicks.
       Key pad is defined for Pyraminx as:
         /     Counterclockwise

       7 8 9   Upper Left, Up, Upper Right
         ^
       4<5>6   Left, Clockwise, Right
         v
       1 2 3   Lower Left, Down, Lower Right

       Use the shift keys to access "Period 4" turns from "Both" mode,
       otherwise it assumes "Period 3" turning.  Points turn in "Period 4" and
       faces turn in "Period 3".

       Use the control key and the left mouse button, keypad, or arrow keys to
       move the whole octahedron.  This is not recorded as a turn.

       The title is in the following format (non-motif version):
              xoct.{3|4|both<turning modes>}: {1|2|3|4|5|6|sticky<number of
              "octas" per edge>} @ (<Number of moves>/{<Record number of
              moves> <username>|"NEVER noaccess"|"practice"}) - <Comment>
       If there is no record of the current puzzle, it displays "NEVER
       noaccess".

OPTIONS
       -geometry {+|-}X{+|-}Y
               This option sets the initial position of the octahedron window
               (resource name "geometry").

       -display host:dpy
               This option specifies the X server to contact.

       -[no]mono
               This option allows you to  display on a color screen as if
               monochrome (resource name "mono").

       -[no]{reverse|rv}
               This option allows you to see the octahedron window in reverse
               video (resource name "reverse").

       -{foreground|fg} color
               This option specifies the foreground of the octahedron window
               (resource name "foreground").

       -{background|bg} color
               This option specifies the background of the octahedron window
               (resource name "background").

       -{border|bd} color
               This option specifies the border color of the octas in the
               octhahedoron window (resource name "borderColor").

       -face{0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7} <color>
               This option allows you to change the color of a face (resource
               name "faceColorN"). In mono-mode, color is represented as the
               first letter of the color name. The faces are ordered top to
               bottom and left to right.  If you has two colors that begin
               with the same letter you should have one in uppercase and one
               in lowercase to distinguish them in mono-mode. You can change
               the colors of the faces to make a stupid octahedron (i.e. all
               White or in mono-mode all "W").  Unfortunately, it will not
               normally say its solved when its randomized.  This would be
               cheating.

       -size <int>
               This option allows you to change the number of octas on a edge
               (resource name "size").

       -sticky This option allows you to set the sticky mode (resource name
               "sticky").

       -mode <int>
               This option allows you to set the turning mode (resource name
               "mode").

       -both   This option allows you to set the turning mode to both period 3
               and period 4 (resource name "mode" set at 5).

       -[no]orient
               This option allows you to access the orient mode (resource name
               "orient").

       -[no]practice
               This option allows you to access the practice mode (resource
               name "practice").  -username string This option specifies the
               user name for any records made or else it will get your login
               name (resource name "userName").

SAVE FORMAT
       The format is not standard.  The reason for this is that this is simple
       and I do not know what the standard is.

       Octahedron with default colors, not randomized:
         0       R     Red
       3   1   M   B   Magenta, Blue
         2       W     White
         4       O     Orange
       7   5   Y   P   Yellow, Pink
         6       G     Green

              size: 1-6 <number of triangles in the same orientation as the
              face per row>
              mode: 3-5 <period 3 turning, period 4 turning, or both (5)>
              orient: 0-1 <0 false, 1 true; if 1 then lines on "octas" to be
              oriented>
              sticky: 0-1 <0 false, 1 true; if 1 then some "octas" move
              together>
              practice: 0-1 <0 false, 1 true>
              moves: 0-MAXINT <total number of moves>

              startingPosition: <2 dimensional array of face "octa" position,
              each face has size * size "octas", if orient mode then
              orientation number follows face number numbered clockwise from 0
              to 11, where 0 is up>

       This is then followed by the moves, starting from 1.
              move #: <face> <position> <direction> <control>
       Each turn is with respect to a face and position.
       Position is 0 to size * size - 1.  Position 0 is the triangle furthest
       from the center, increasing clockwise.
       Direction is represented as 0 up, 1 upper right, 2 right, 3 lower
       right, 4 down, 5 lower left, 6 left, 7 upper left, 9 clockwise, and 15
       counterclockwise.
       Control is represented as 0 or 1, 1 if the whole octahedron is moved at
       once (here position does not matter), 0 if not.  The xoct record keeper
       does not count a control move as a move, but here we do.

       Caution: the program may crash on corrupted input.
