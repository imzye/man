NAME
       XML::Filter::SAX1toSAX2 - Convert SAX1 events to SAX2

SYNOPSIS
         use XML::Filter::SAX1toSAX2;
         # create a SAX2 handler
         my $handler = XML::Handler::AxPoint->new();
         # filter from SAX1 to SAX2
         my $filter = XML::Filter::SAX1toSAX2->new(Handler => $handler);
         # SAX1 parser
         my $parser = XML::Parser::PerlSAX->new(Handler => $filter);
         # parse file
         $parser->parse(Source => { SystemId => "file.xml" });

DESCRIPTION
       This module is a very simple module for creating SAX2 events from SAX1
       events. It is useful in the case where you have a SAX1 parser but want
       to use a SAX2 handler or filter of some sort.

       As an added bonus, it also does namespace processing for you!
