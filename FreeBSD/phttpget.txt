PHTTPGET(8)             FreeBSD System Manager's Manual            PHTTPGET(8)

NAME
     phttpget – retrieve multiple files via pipelined HTTP

SYNOPSIS
     phttpget server file ...

DESCRIPTION
     The phttpget utility is a minimalist pipelined HTTP client, which is used
     to retrieve multiple files from one server, and saves the downloaded
     files in the current working directory, using the last portion of their
     download path as file names.

     By making several "in flight" HTTP requests, it can dramatically increase
     performance when a large number of small files need to be downloaded.

     The freebsd-update(8) and portsnap(8) tools use phttpget to download
     binary patch files.

ENVIRONMENT
     HTTP_PROXY       URL of the proxy to use for HTTP requests.

     HTTP_PROXY_AUTH  Authorization parameters for the HTTP proxy.

     HTTP_USER_AGENT  The User-Agent string to use for HTTP requests.  The
                      default is “phttpget/0.1”.

     HTTP_TIMEOUT     Timeout for HTTP request in seconds.
