RDMA_POST_RECVV(3)       Librdmacm Programmer's Manual      RDMA_POST_RECVV(3)



NAME
       rdma_post_recvv - post a work request to receive incoming messages.

SYNOPSIS
       #include <rdma/rdma_verbs.h>

       int rdma_post_recvv (struct rdma_cm_id *id, void *context, struct
       ibv_sge *sgl, int nsge);

ARGUMENTS
       id          A reference to a communication identifier where the message
                   buffer(s) will be posted.

       context     User-defined context associated with the request.

       sgl         A scatter-gather list of memory buffers posted as a single
                   request.

       nsge        The number of scatter-gather entries in the sgl array.

DESCRIPTION
       Posts a single work request to the receive queue of the queue pair
       associated with the rdma_cm_id.  The posted buffers will be queued to
       receive an incoming message sent by the remote peer.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error.  If an error occurs, errno will
       be set to indicate the failure reason.

NOTES
       The user is responsible for ensuring that the receive is posted, and
       the total buffer space is large enough to contain all sent data before
       the peer posts the corresponding send message.  The message buffers
       must have been registered before being posted, and the buffers must
       remain registered until the receive completes.

       Messages may be posted to an rdma_cm_id only after a queue pair has
       been associated with it.  A queue pair is bound to an rdma_cm_id after
       calling rdma_create_ep or rdma_create_qp, if the rdma_cm_id is
       allocated using rdma_create_id.

       The user-defined context associated with the receive request will be
       returned to the user through the work completion wr_id, work request
       identifier, field.
