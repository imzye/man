CHGREP(1)               FreeBSD General Commands Manual              CHGREP(1)

NAME
       chgrep - change oldpattern to newpattern

SYNOPSIS
       chgrep [-en/w] [-dhilqrsv] [-t filename] OLDPATTERN NEWPATTERN
       [file...]

DESCRIPTION
       Chgrep searches the input files (or standard input if no files are
       named) for oldstring and changes them to newstring. If some file and
       file.lock exist then chgrep leaves both files unchanged. You can write
       NEWPATTERN as "NULL" to clear OLDPATTERN, i.e.  "chgrep oldstring NULL
       somefile.c".

       -d     Don't change modification times of altered files.

       -e     Extended-regexp.

       -h     Print the version number of chgrep to standard output.  This
              version number should be included in all bug reports (see
              below).

       -i     Ignore differences in case at OLDPATTERN.

       -l     Leaves copy of old file unchanged in filename.lock

       -n     Treat <newline> as a regular character.

       -q     Quiet mode (no output at all).

       -r     Read all files under each subdirectory, recursively.

       -s     Simulation mode.

       -t     Use not default file.lock for caching.

       -v     Prints to standard output diagnostic informations.

       -w     Doesn't recognize regexp in OLDPATTERN. This option accelerates
              the whole process. Incompatible with -e and/or -n.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Normally, exit status is 0 if no errors were found, and 1 if some
       errors were found. The -v option helps to understand the sense of the
       exit status.

BUGS
       Email bug reports to bartek@bmk.bz.  Be sure to include the word
       “chgrep” somewhere in the “Subject:” field.
