DESCRIPTION
       XTide is a package that provides tide and current predictions in a wide
       variety of formats. Graphs, text listings, and calendars can be
       generated, or a tide clock can be provided on your desktop.

       XTide can work with X-windows, plain text terminals, or the web. This
       is accomplished with three separate programs: the interactive interface
       (xtide), the non-interactive or command line interface (tide), and the
       web interface (xttpd).

       tide is the non-interactive command line client for XTide 2.  For a
       complete discussion, please see the verbose documentation at
       https://flaterco.com/xtide/.

CONFIGURATION
       Unless a configuration file /etc/xtide.conf is supplied, you must set
       the environment variable HFILE_PATH to point to the harmonics files
       that should have been installed along with the xtide program.  Example:
              export HFILE_PATH=/usr/local/share/xtide/harmonics.tcd
       If a configuration file is used, the first line should consist of the
       colon-separated list of harmonics files (e.g. the HFILE_PATH line above
       without the "export HFILE_PATH=" part).  The environment variable takes
       precedence over the configuration file.

       Set the environment variable XTIDE_DEFAULT_LOCATION to the name of your
       favorite place if you want to skip the location-choosing step.

OPTIONS
       -b ``YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM''
              Specify the begin (start) time for predictions using the ISO
              8601 compliant format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM, where hours range from
              00 to 23.  The timestamp is in the local time zone for the
              location, or in UTC if the -z setting is engaged.  If clock mode
              is selected or if no -b is supplied, the current time will be
              used.

       -cf ``format-string''
              strftime(3) style format string for printing days in calendars
              (default %a %d).

       -ch pixels
              Height for tide clocks (default 312 pixels).

       -cw pixels
              Width for tide clocks (default 84 pixels).

       -dc color
              Daytime background color in tide graphs (default SkyBlue).

       -Dc color
              Color of datum line in tide graphs (default white).

       -df ``format-string''
              strftime(3) style format string for printing dates (default
              %Y-%m-%d).  For calendars see -cf.

       -e ``YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM''
              Specify the end (stop) time for predictions in banner, calendar,
              alt. calendar, medium rare, plain, raw, or stats mode.  Does not
              apply in graph and clock modes:  the effective end time for
              graph and clock modes is entirely determined by the start time
              (-b), the width (-cw, -gw or -tw), and the aspect (-ga).  The
              format and time zone are the same as for -b.  If no -e is
              supplied, the end time will be set to four days after the begin
              time.

       -ec color
              Foreground in tide graphs during outgoing tide (default
              SeaGreen).

       -el y|n
              Select whether or not to draw datum and middle-level lines in
              tide graphs (default n).

              The National Ocean Service (NOS) defines both Mean Sea Level
              (MSL) and Mean Tide Level (MTL) in terms of averages taken over
              observations.  The middle-level line is drawn at the midpoint of
              the theoretical tidal range, which usually corresponds to the
              mathematical mean level of the predictions.  This approximates
              both MSL and MTL, but, strictly speaking, is equivalent to
              neither.  Moreover, subordinate station offsets may shift the
              actual mean so that it no longer falls at the midpoint of the
              tidal range.  The datum line is drawn at the zero level of the
              predictions, which usually corresponds to the station's
              benchmark, but this too can be rendered inaccurate by
              subordinate station offsets.

       -em pSsMm
              Events to suppress (p = phase of moon, S = sunrise, s = sunset,
              M = moonrise, m = moonset), or x to suppress none.  E.g, to
              suppress all sun and moon events, set eventmask to the value
              pSsMm.

       -f c|h|i|l|p|t|v
              Specify the output format as CSV, HTML, iCalendar, LaTeX, PNG,
              text, or SVG.  The default is text.

       -fc color
              Foreground in tide graphs during incoming tide (default Blue).

       -fg color
              Color of text and other notations (default black).

       -ga aspect
              Aspect for tide graphs, clocks, and banners (default 1.0).  This
              controls not the width or height of the window but rather the
              relative scaling of the X and Y axes in the plot of the tide
              curve.

       -gh pixels
              Height for tide graphs (default 312 pixels).

       -gs d|l|s
              Style of graphs and clocks.  Valid values: d (default), l
              (line), s (semitransparent).

       -gt y|n
              Select whether or not to label tenths of units in tide graphs
              (default n).

       -gw pixels
              Width for tide graphs (default 960 pixels).

       -hf ``format-string''
              strftime(3) style format string for printing hour labels on time
              axis (default %l).

       -in y|n
              Select whether or not to use inferred values for some
              constituents (default n).  For expert use only.

       -l ``location name''
              Specify a location for tide predictions.  You get the first
              station where the name supplied with -l is a case-insensitive
              match with the beginning (or the entirety) of the station's
              name.

       -lb y|n
              Select whether or not calendar mode inserts a line break before
              prediction values (default n).

       -lw pixels
              Width of line in graph styles l and s (default 2.5 pixels).

       -m a|b|c|C|g|k|l|m|p|r|s
              Specify mode to be about, banner, calendar, alt. calendar,
              graph, clock, list, medium rare, plain, raw, or stats.  The
              default is plain.

       -mc color
              Color of mark line in graphs (default red).

       -Mc color
              Color of middle-level line in tide graphs (default yellow).

       -ml [-]N.NN(ft|m|kt)
              Specify the mark level to be used in predictions.  The
              predictions will include the times when the tide level crosses
              the mark.  Not supported in clock mode.  Example usage: -ml
              -0.25ft

       -nc color
              Nighttime background color in tide graphs (default DeepSkyBlue).

       -o ``filename''
              Redirect output to the specified file (appends).

       -ou y|n
              Select whether or not to print numbers with no ft/m/kt (default
              n). Where possible, adds a header line stating the units and
              datum.

       -pb y|n
              Select whether or not calendar mode inserts a page break and
              repeats the station header for each month in text, HTML, and
              LaTeX formats (default y).

       -ph mm Nominal length of paper in LaTeX output (default 420 mm).  This
              need not match your actual paper; use "Shrink oversized pages"
              in print options.

       -pi days
              Number of days of predictions to generate when no end time is
              specified (default 4).

       -pm mm Nominal width of top, bottom, left and right margins in LaTeX
              output (default 10 mm).  Actual width will depend on print
              scaling.

       -pw mm Nominal width of paper in LaTeX output (default 297 mm). This
              need not match your actual paper; use "Shrink oversized pages"
              in print options.

       -s ``HH:MM''
              Specify the step interval, in hours and minutes, for raw or
              medium rare mode predictions.  The default is one hour.

       -tf ``format-string''
              strftime(3) style format string for printing times (default
              %l:%M %p %Z).

       -th characters
              Height of ASCII graphs and clocks (default 24 characters).

       -tl y|n
              Select whether or not to draw depth lines on top of the tide
              graph (default n).

       -to opacity
              Opacity of the fill in graph style s (semitransparent) (default
              0.65).

       -tw characters
              Width of text format (default 79 characters).

       -u ft|m
              Preferred units of length (default no preference).

       -v     Print version string and exit.

       -z y|n Select whether or not to coerce all time zones to UTC (default
              n).

NOTES
       If the environment variable TERM is set to vt100 or vt102, tide will
       take it seriously and invoke the DEC Special Graphics character set in
       text form output.
