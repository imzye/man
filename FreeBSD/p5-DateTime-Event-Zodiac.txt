DateTime::Event::Zodiac(3)                 User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       DateTime::Event::Zodiac - Return zodiac for a given date

SYNOPSIS
         use DateTime::Event::Zodiac qw(zodiac_date_name zodiac_date_symbol zodiac_astro_name zodiac_astro_symbol);

         my $dt = DateTime->new(
           year   => 1979,
           month  => 3,
           day    => 27,
         );

         print zodiac_date_name($dt);
         print zodiac_astro_symbol($dt);

       Returns the latin zodiac name or alternatively the unicode zodiac
       symbol for the given date. The zodiac may be calculated using either
       fixed dates or using the exact longitude of the sun.

       The module exports no symbols by default. All used functions must be
       requested in the use statement.

       All methods return undef on failure.

DESCRIPTION
   zodiac_date_name
        $name = zodiac_date_name($dt);

       Latin zodiac name: aries, taurus, gemini, cancer, leo, virgo, libra,
       scorpius, sagittarius, capricornus, aquarius and pisces.

       Fixed dates.

   zodiac_date_symbol
        $symbol = zodiac_date_symbol($dt);

       Unicode zodiac symbol positions U+2648 to U+2653.

       Fixed dates.

   zodiac_astro_name
        $name = zodiac_astro_name($dt);

       Latin zodiac name: aries, taurus, gemini, ...

       Calculated from the longitude of the sun.

   zodiac_astro_symbol
        $symbol = zodiac_astro_symbol($dt);

       Unicode zodiac symbol positions U+2648 to U+2653.

       Calculated from the longitude of the sun.

   zodiac_date
       Simply computes the zodiac from the fixed date and returns a hash with
       the keys name, symbol, start and end.

       Used internally by "zodiac_date_name" and "zodiac_date_symbol"

   zodiac_astro
       Computes the zodiac from the position of the sun and returns a hash
       with the keys name, symbol, start and end. The keys start and end
       should be ignored since they are only used for the "zodiac_date"
       function.

       May differ from the results of "zodiac_date" depending on the solar
       year (leap year ect).

       See DateTime::Astro for notes on accuracy.

       Used internally by "zodiac_astro_name" and "zodiac_astro_symbol"

DISCLAIMER
       The author of this module regads astrology as being a pseudoscience and
       superstition. I wrote this module for my job. I was young, foolish and
       I needed the money.

TODO
       The "zodiac_astro_horoscope" and "zodiac_date_horoscope" functions have
       not yet been implemented and probably never will be ;-)
