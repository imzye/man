LV2PROC(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             LV2PROC(1)

NAME
       lv2proc - a simple command line effect processor using LV2 plugins

SYNOPSIS
       lv2proc [ options ] -i input -o output plugin
       lv2proc -h|--help
       lv2proc --version

DESCRIPTION
       lv2proc generates an output sound file by applying a LV2 effect plugin
       to an input sound file.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Print a short description of the command line options on the
              standard output and quit.

       --version
              Print version and copyright information on the standard output
              and quit.

       -i input
              Indicates the input sound file.

       -o output
              Indicates the output sound file.

       plugin LV2 plugin URI.

       -n frames
              Number of audio frames to be processed at each cycle (default is
              512).

       -c port:value
              Assigns value to the port identified by port symbol port.  The
              specified port must be a control input port and value must be a
              floating-point number in a form that strtof(3) undestands,
              assuming that the "C" locale is being used.

       --with-latency
              Disables latency compensation that is generously offered to you
              by default.

       --timing
              Report some timing statistics on the standard output after sound
              processing.

       --normalize
              Normalize the output file by applying the same gain factor to
              all channels. No fancy loudness estimation going on here, just
              trying to make use of the whole dynamic range of the output file
              format.

ENVIRONMENT
       LV2_PATH
              Used to override the list of directories where LV2 plugin
              bundles are looked for (as per LV2 FHS, see
              <http://lv2plug.in/trac/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard>).
