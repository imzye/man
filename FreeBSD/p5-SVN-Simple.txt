NAME
       SVN::Simple::Edit - A simple interface for driving svn delta editors

SYNOPSIS
        my $edit = SVN::Simple::Edit->new
           (_editor => [SVN::Repos::get_commit_editor($repos, "file://$repospath",
                                             '/', 'root', 'FOO', \&committed)],
           );

        $edit->open_root($fs->youngest_rev);
        $edit->add_directory ('trunk');
        $edit->add_file ('trunk/filea');
        $edit->modify_file ("trunk/fileb", "content", $checksum);
        $edit->delete_entry ("trunk/filec");
        $edit->close_edit ();
        ...
        $edit->copy_directory ('branches/a, trunk, 0);

DESCRIPTION
       SVN::Simple::Edit wraps the subversion delta editor with a perl
       friendly interface and then you could easily drive it for describing
       changes to a tree. A common usage is to wrap the commit editor, so you
       could make commits to a subversion repository easily.

       This also means you can not supply the $edit object as an delta_editor
       to other API, and that's why this module is named ::Edit instead of
       ::Editor.

       See SVN::Simple::Editor for simple interface implementing a delta
       editor.

PARAMETERS
   for constructor
       _editor
           The editor that will receive delta editor calls.

       missing_handler
           Called when parent directory are not opened yet, could be:

           \&SVN::Simple::Edit::build_missing
               Always build parents if you don't open them explicitly.

           \&SVN::Simple::Edit::open_missing
               Always open the parents if you don't create them explicitly.

           SVN::Simple::Edit::check_missing ([$root])
               Check if the path exists on $root. Open it if so, otherwise
               create it.

       root
           The default root to use by SVN::Simple::Edit::check_missing.

       base_path
           The base path the edit object is created to send delta editor
           calls.

       noclose
           Do not close files or directories. This might make non-sorted
           operations on directories/files work.

METHODS
       Note: Don't expect all editors will work with operations not sorted in
       DFS order.

       open_root ($base_rev)
       add_directory ($path)
       open_directory ($path)
       copy_directory ($path, $from, $fromrev)
       add_file ($path)
       open_file ($path)
       copy_file ($path, $from, $fromrev)
       delete_entry ($path)
       change_dir_prop ($path, $propname, $propvalue)
       change_file_prop ($path, $propname, $propvalue)
       close_edit ()
