VM_MAP_LOCK(9)         FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual        VM_MAP_LOCK(9)

NAME
     vm_map_lock, vm_map_unlock, vm_map_lock_read, vm_map_unlock_read,
     vm_map_trylock, vm_map_trylock_read, vm_map_lock_upgrade,
     vm_map_lock_downgrade – vm_map locking macros

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <vm/vm.h>
     #include <vm/vm_map.h>

     void
     vm_map_lock(vm_map_t map);

     void
     vm_map_unlock(vm_map_t map);

     void
     vm_map_lock_read(vm_map_t map);

     void
     vm_map_unlock_read(vm_map_t map);

     int
     vm_map_trylock(vm_map_t map);

     int
     vm_map_trylock_read(vm_map_t map);

     int
     vm_map_lock_upgrade(vm_map_t map);

     int
     vm_map_lock_downgrade(vm_map_t map);

DESCRIPTION
     The vm_map_lock() macro obtains an exclusive lock on map.

     The vm_map_unlock() macro releases an exclusive lock on map.

     The vm_map_lock_read() macro obtains a read-lock on map.

     The vm_map_unlock_read() macro releases a read-lock on map.

     The vm_map_trylock() macro attempts to obtain an exclusive lock on map.
     It returns FALSE if the lock cannot be immediately acquired; otherwise
     return TRUE with the lock acquired.

     The vm_map_trylock_read() macro attempts to obtain a read-lock on map.
     It returns FALSE if the lock cannot be immediately acquired; otherwise
     return TRUE with the lock acquired.

     The vm_map_lock_upgrade() macro attempts to atomically upgrade a read-
     lock on map to an exclusive lock.

     The vm_map_lock_downgrade() macro attempts to downgrade an exclusive lock
     on map to a read-lock.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
     Currently, all of the locking macros implement their locks as sleep
     locks.
