NAME
       Amazon::SimpleDB - a low-level perlish interface for working with
       Amazon's SimpleDB service.

DESCRIPTION
       This is code is in the early stages of development. Do not consider it
       stable. Feedback and patches welcome.

       Amazon::SimpleDB provides a "low-level" perlish interface for working
       with Amazon's SimpleDB (SMB) service.

       "Amazon SimpleDB is a web service for running queries on structured
       data in real time. This service works in close conjunction with Amazon
       Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
       (Amazon EC2), collectively providing the ability to store, process and
       query data sets in the cloud. These services are designed to make web-
       scale computing easier and more cost-effective for developers."

       To sign up for an Amazon Web Services account, required to use this
       library and the SimpleDB service, please visit the Amazon Web Services
       web site at http://www.amazonaws.com/.

       You will be billed accordingly by Amazon when you use this module and
       must be responsible for these costs.

METHODS
   Amazon::SimpleDB->new($args)
   Amazon::SimpleDB->domains
   $sdb->domain($name)
   $sdb->create_domain($name)
   $sdb->delete_domain($name)
   $sdb->request($action,[\%args])
   timestamp([$epoch])

TO DO
       Development of a proper test suite. Currently this module is only
       testing that the code compiles. This priority one.
       Support the use of HTTP POST. Right now the module only uses GET for
       everything. The SimpleDB is sadly GETsful and not really REST.
       Support retries of the SimpleDB service is a server error (HTTP 5xx
       status) is returned before giving.
       Implement a "query_all" method that will automatically issue multiple
       calls to the service if a NextToken is returned.
