NAME
       Crypt::GOST_PP - Pure Perl implementation of the GOST encryption
       algorithm

SYNOPSIS
         use Crypt::GOST_PP;
         $ref = Crypt::GOST_PP->new( $passphrase );
         $encrypted = $ref->encrypt( $plaintext );

         $ref2 = Crypt::GOST_PP->new( $passphrase );
         $decrypted = $ref2->decrypt( $encrypted );

DESCRIPTION
       GOST is a 64-bit symmectric block cipher with a 256-bit key, from the
       former Soviet Union.

       It is important to note that there are (or have been) several other
       GOST encryption modules for perl. This version is in no way intended to
       supersede any other such implementations, specifically Crypt::GOST. The
       purpose for writing this module was that I do a great deal of work on
       Win32 systems, and I have been unsuccessful in my attempts to get
       Crypt::GOST to install correctly in that environment. A previous
       version of Crypt::GOST, v0.41, was also a pure perl implementation, but
       it lacked documentation, and as such it was more difficult to use than
       one would prefer. As a result of these two things, I wanted to write a
       pure perl implementation, with requisite documentation, that will run
       regardless of the OS.

       Much of the core logic of Crypt::GOST_PP was originally based on Vipul
       Ved Prakash's "GOST in 417 bytes of Perl" <http://www.vipul.net/gost/>.
       The code contained herein has undergone numerous revisions and
       modifications since that original diminutive implementation.
