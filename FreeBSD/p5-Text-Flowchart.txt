DESCRIPTION
       Text::Flowchart does what the synopsis implies, it makes ASCII
       flowcharts.  It also (hopefully) makes it easy to make ASCII
       flowcharts.

REQUIRES
       Carp

OBJECT METHODS
   CREATION
       New flowcharts are created with the new constructor.

       $object = Text::Flowchart->new();

       You can also initialize values at creation time, such as:

        $object = Text::Flowchart->new(
                               "width" =>      120,
                               "debug" =>      1
                       );

   ACCESSORS
       There aren't any.  Well, there aren't any that you really should use.

       Why's that, you ask?  Because that's how the module is written.  Once
       an object is added into a flowchart, its appearance becomes set in
       stone.  And I mean totally set in stone, you cannot remove a box from a
       flowchart, it sticks around until the flowchart is destroyed.  Even if
       you poked around in the internals of the module and discovered that
       ->string is an accessor in the box class, for instance, it wouldn't do
       you any good since objects are immediately rendered upon their
       creation.  Even if you re-render the object after fiddling with it,
       it's not going to work since the objects are inserted into the
       flowchart's internal grid once they're rendered.

       So basically, declare everything you need to declare about an object
       when you create it, and make sure that that's the information you're
       going to use when you print it out.  It's not that hard.  :)

   Methods
       There are several methods you are allowed to invoke upon your flowchart
       object.

       new (?width? ?height? ?pad? ?debug?)
                 This is the object constructor that actually creates your
                 flowchart object.  All parameters are optional and are passed
                 in a hash.

                 width
                  Optional. Specifies the width of your flowchart object, or
                  uses the module default (72).

                  The width of a flowchart must be specified, it cannot grow
                  to accomodate objects placed within it.  If you try to place
                  an object beyond the edge of the flowchart, you'll die with
                  an error.

                 height
                  Optional. Specifies the height of your flowchart object, or
                  uses the module default (0).

                  The default height of 0 means that your flowchart will grow
                  in height as much as necessary to accomodate the height of
                  whatever you insert into your flowchart.  You can also
                  specify a specific height so that your flowchart will be no
                  taller than 17 rows, for example.  If you try to place an
                  object beyond the bottom of the flowchart, you'll die with
                  an error.

                 pad
                  Optional. pad allows you to specify a padding character.
                  The padding character is what is used to fill in the space
                  between boxes and lines.  The default padding character is a
                  space (\040), but you can set it to anything else you'd
                  like.  This is most useful when debugging, IMHO.  Very
                  useful in combination with debug (see below).  Set to " " by
                  default.

                 debug
                  Optional. debug will print out the x & y coordinates of the
                  flowchart.  This should greatly help you place your boxes
                  where you want them to be.  Off by default, set to 1 to
                  enable.

                 directed
                  Optional. directed specifies that your flowchart is
                  direction dependent.  This will add on arrows to all of your
                  lines.  Flowcharts are non-directed by default.  Set this to
                  1 to use a directed flowchart.

                 For example:

                  $flowchart = Text::Flowchart::new->(); #boring flowchart, no options

                  $flowchart = Text::Flowchart::new->(   #flowchart specifying new width, a % as the padding character, and using the debugging option
                         "width" => 100,
                         "pad"   => "%",
                         "debug" => 1
                  );

                  $flowchart = Text::Flowchart::new(             #using periods as the padding character
                         "pad"   => "."
                  );

       box (string x_coord y_coord ?x_pad? ?y_pad? ?width? ?height?)
                 You use the box method to add a new box into your flowchart
                 object.  All parameters are passed in a hash.

                 The text within a box is wrapped at word boundaries if
                 possible, or at the appropriate width if not possible so that
                 all of your text fits inside your box.

                 string
                  Required. string is the message that you'll see within the
                  box.  Want your box to say "Hi there!"?  "string" => "Hi
                  there!";  Easy as pie.

                 x_coord
                  Required. The x coordinate of the upper left corner of the
                  box.  Use the debug option to help you find your
                  coordinates.

                 y_coord
                  Required. The y coordinate of the upper left corner of the
                  box.  Use the debug option to help you find your
                  coordinates.

                 x_pad
                  Optional. x_pad allows you to specify the amount of
                  horizontal white space between the edges of the box and the
                  text within.  If this option is not specified, it'll use the
                  default of a single space.

                 y_pad
                  Optional. y_pad allows you to specify the amount of vertical
                  white space between the edges of the box and the text
                  within.  If this option is not specified, it'll use the
                  default of a single line of white space.

                 width
                  Optional. width allows you to specify the width of the box.
                  The narrowest possible box has a width of 3.  You must take
                  into account your x_pad value, as well as the edges of the
                  box when you specify a width.  If no width is specified, it
                  will use the default of 15.

                  If you specify a width of 0 (zero), then your box will grow
                  horizontally to accomodate all of your text, or until it
                  reaches the width of the flowchart, whichever is lesser.  Be
                  careful!  This will put all of your box message onto the
                  same line.  You almost never want your width to be 0.

                 height
                  Optional. height allows you to specify the height of the
                  box.  The shortest possible box has a height of 3.  You must
                  take into account your y_pad value, as well as the edges of
                  the box when you specify a height.  If no height is
                  specified, it will use the default of 0 (zero).

                  If you specify a height of 0 (zero), then your box will grow
                  vertically to accomodate all of your text, or until it
                  reaches the height of the flowchart, whichever is lesser.
                  You most likely want a box width of some fixed value, and a
                  box height of zero so it will grow to accomodate your
                  message.

                  If you specify a non-zero box height, then your string will
                  be truncated once the box reaches the height that you
                  specified.  It will still be created, you just won't have
                  all of your text in it.

                  For example:

                   $example_box = $flowchart->box(                                                                #creates a box at (15,0)
                          "string" => "Do you need to make a flowchart?",
                          "x_coord" => 15,
                          "y_coord" => 0
                   );

                   Output:

                                 +-------------+

                   $example_box2 = $flowchart->box(                                                               #creates a box at (0,0), with new x_pad and y_pad values

       relate ([from, from side, ?on side?], [to, to side, ?on side?],
       ?reason?) the relate method connects boxes to each other.  Once two
                 boxes are related, a line is automatically drawn between
                 then, listing a reason if given, and arrows if it's a
                 directed flowchart.  The relate method spares you the trouble
                 of having to re-position your lines if you move your boxes
                 around.  You may still have to do some fiddling (such as
                 changing the sides that are connected), but it's much less
                 trouble than re-arranging the boxes and the lines.

                 (from or to)
                  Required. This is the box that you're relating from or to,
                  it's the first item in an anonymous array.

                 (from or to) side
                  Required. This is the side of the box that you're relating
                  from or to.  This must be either "top", "bottom", "right",
                  or "left".  It's the second item in an anonymous array.

                 ?on side?
                  Optional. This optional item specifies where on the box side
                  you'd like to draw the line from.  If zero, it will take the
                  first available slot starting from the left (if drawing from
                  the top or bottom) or from the top (it drawing from the
                  right or left).  If -1, it will take the first available
                  slot starting from the other side (right for top and bottom
                  or bottom for right or left).  If any other number, it will
                  draw the line at that position, along the side, again
                  counting from the left or the top.

                 reason
                  Optional. reason is a name and value pair that specifies why
                  you would take that route.  The value must be one character
                  long, you'll die with an error if it isn't.  reasons only
                  make sense in a directed flowchart, they don't appear in
                  non-directed ones.  Typical values are "Y" for yes and "N"
                  for no.  If no reason is specified, the default direction
                  character will be used.

                  For example:

                  $flowchart = Text::Flowchart->new(      "width" => 50,
                       "directed" => 1);

                   $example_box = $flowchart->box(                                                                #creates a box at (0,0)
                          "string" => "Do you need to make a flowchart?",
                          "x_coord" => 0,
                          "y_coord" => 2,
                   );

                    $example_box2 = $flowchart->box(                                                              #creates a box at (15,0)
                          "string" => "Yes I do.",
                          "x_coord" => 19,
                          "y_coord" => 0,
                          "width"   => 13

                 draw (?FILEHANDLE?)
                   the draw method actuall outputs your flowchart.  You can optionally give it a glob to a filehandle to re-direct the output to that filehandle.

                   For example:

                   $flowchart->draw();    #draw your flowchart on STDOUT;

                   $flowchart->draw(*FILE);       #send it to the FILE filehandle.

                  Required. This is the box that you're relating from or to,
                  it's the first item in an anonymous array.

EXAMPLE
       This code will print out the flowchart shown up in the SYNOPSIS.

       use Text::Flowchart;

        $flowchart = Text::Flowchart->new(
               "width" => 50,
               "directed" => 0);

        $begin = $flowchart->box(
               "string" => "BEGIN",
               "x_coord" => 0,
               "y_coord" => 0,
               "width"   => 9,
               "y_pad"   => 0
        );

        $start = $flowchart->box(
               "string" => "Do you need to make a flowchart?",
               "x_coord" => 15,
               "y_coord" => 0
        );

        $yes = $flowchart->box(
               "string" => "Then my module may help.",
               "x_coord" => 0,
               "y_coord" => 10
        );

        $use = $flowchart->box(
               "string" => "So use it.",
               "x_coord" => 16,
               "y_coord" => 8,
               "width"   => 14
        );

        $no = $flowchart->box(
               "string" => "Then go do something else.",
               "x_coord" => 30,
               "y_coord" => 17
        );

        $flowchart->relate(
               [$begin, "right"] => [$start, "left", 1]
        );

        $flowchart->relate(
               [$start, "left", 3] => [$yes, "top", 5],
               "reason" => "Y"
        );

        $flowchart->relate(
               [$start, "right", 2] => [$no, "top", 5],
               "reason" => "N"
        );

        $flowchart->relate(
               [$yes, "right", 4] => [$use, "bottom", 2]
        );

        $flowchart->relate(

        );

        $flowchart->draw();

FAQ
       Why in the world did you write this thing?

       There's a flowcharting-type program that a couple of people use at
       work.  It is only available on PCs.  I got cranky about not being able
       to use it, so I wrote my own.  Admittedly, mine isn't as powerful or as
       easy to use as theirs is, but I'm quite pleased with it nonetheless.
       Real programmers don't use software tools.  Real programmers write
       software tools.

       Hey!  I created a box, and then I tried to change its string and it
       didn't work!  What gives?

       Boxes are rendered upon their creation.  You cannot change their
       strings once their are created.  I may change this in a future release,
       but for now just wait until you're sure you know what you want in a box
       before you create it, okay?  That way you won't have to change it
       later.

       Hey!  I'm running a memory tracer, and even though I deleted a box, the
       memory wasn't freed up.  Do you have a memory leak or what?

       Nope.  Boxes are stored internally inside the flowchart object.  The
       box variable that you get back from ->box is just a reference to the
       box that lives inside the flowchart.  Since the flowchart still knows
       the box exists (even if you don't), the memory is not freed up.
       Naturally, it will be freed once perl exits.  I may add in the ability
       to remove boxes to a future release.

       I want to draw lines from the left side of a box to the left side of
       another box, but I get an error. Why?

       Because you can't draw lines like that.  :)

       Basically, there are 10 types of lines that can be drawn (all of which
       are done by the relate method, naturally). They look like:

        +---+  +--+        +--+  +  +        +  +-+  +-+  +        +
                  |        |     |  |        |    |  |    |        |
                  +--+  +--+     +  +--+  +--+    +  +    +--+  +--+
                                       |  |
                                       +  +

       Or horizontal, zig-zagging horizontal, vertical, zig-zagging vertical,
       and corners.  Connecting the same sides of boxes would require another
       type of line, (the "handle", FWIW), and Text::Flowchart can't draw
       those.  If I can think of a good way to implement them I will.
       Incidentally, you can draw your own lines if you need to, using the
       ->line method.

        $flowchart->line(
               "from"  => [xfrom, yfrom],
               "to"    => [yfrom, yto],
               "reason"=> "Y"
        );

       But you really should use relate and not connect the same sides of
       boxes, it will make your life much simpler.

       I made a flowchart, but all of the lines cross over each other and make
       a mess.  Why?

       Text::Flowchart has no collision detection.  If you try to place a box
       where another box already was, it'll gladly be drawn over.  Whichever
       boxes or lines are drawn last will take priority.  If things are being
       over-written, then you need to change the coordinates of your boxes so
       they stop over-writing each other, or change the box sides that are
       related so they don't draw over boxes.

       Squares and rectangles are boring.  Can I draw other shapes?

       Not yet.  The module is actually numerous packages, heavily subclassing
       each other.  Adding in additional shapes is quite easy, actually.
       You'd just need to define a subclass of the Text::Flowchart::Shape
       class and define the necessary functions.  You'd have to declare a
       render method to actually create the ASCII object, a relate method that
       knows how to draw the lines between objects, a get_next_coord method to
       get the next available coordinate on a given side, and make the
       necessary modifications to your new constructor (calling ::Shape's
       init(), of course), and you're done!

       It's actually much easier than it sounds, from a programming
       standpoint.  Figuring out how to properly render and relate object,
       that's tricky.  I will be adding more shapes into a future release.  If
       anyone wants to add their own shapes, e-mail 'em to me and I may add
       them in in the future.

       So what is it with these version numbers anyway?

       I'm going to try to be consistent in how I number the releases.

       The hundredths digit will indicate bug fixes, etc.

       The tenths digit will indicate new and/or better functionality, as well
       as some minor new features.

       The ones digit will indicate a major new feature or re-write.

       Basically, if you have x.ab and x.ac comes out, you want to get it
       guaranteed.  Same for x.ad, x.ae, etc.

       If you have x.ac and x.ba comes out, you'll probably want to get it.
       Invariably there will be bug fixes from the last "hundredths" release,
       but it'll also have additional features.  These will be the releases to
       be sure to read up on to make sure that nothing drastic has changes.

       If you have x.ac and y.ac comes out, it will be the same as x.ac->x.ba
       but on a much larger scale.

       Anything else you want to tell me?

       Sure, anything you need to know.  Just drop me a message.

MISCELLANEA
       If there's something that you feel would be worthwhile to include,
       please let me know and I'll consider adding it.

       How do you know what's a worthwhile addition?  Basically, if it would
       make your life easier.  Am I definitely going to include it?  Nope.  No
       way.  But I'll certainly consider it, all suggestions are appreciated.
       I may even be nice and fill you in on some of the ideas I have for a
       future release, if you ask nicely.  :)
