EFIBOOTMGR(8)           FreeBSD System Manager's Manual          EFIBOOTMGR(8)

NAME
     efibootmgr – manipulate the EFI Boot Manager

SYNOPSIS
     [-aAnNB Bootvar] [-t timeout] [-T] [-o bootorder] [-verbose] [-c --k
     kernel -l loader [-L label] [--dry-run] [-b Bootvar]]

DESCRIPTION
     efibootmgr manipulates how UEFI Boot Managers boot the system.  Methods
     of booting can be created and destroyed.  Boot methods can be activated
     or deactivated.  The order of boot methods tried can be changed.
     Temporary boot methods can override the usual booting methods.

     The UEFI standard defines how hosts may control what is used to bootstrap
     the system.  Each method is encapsulated within a persistent UEFI
     variable, stored by the UEFI BIOS of the form BootXXXX.  These variables
     are numbered, describe where to load the bootstrap program from, and
     whether or not the method is active.  The boot order of these methods is
     controlled by another variable BootOrder.  The currently booting method
     is communicated using BootCurrent.  A global timeout can also be set.

     efibootmgr requires that the kernel efirt module to get and set these
     non-volatile variables.

     The following options are available:

     -c --create                   Create a new Boot Variable

     -l --loader loader            The path to and name of the loader.

     -k --kernel kernel            The path to and name of the kernel.

     -b -Bootvar                   When creating an entry, use Bootvar as the
                                   index.  Fail if it already exists.

     -L --label label              An optional description for the entry.

     -D --dry-run                  Process but do not set the given BootVar.

     -B --delete BootVarNum        Delete the given BootVar Num.

     -a --activate BootVarNum      Activate the given BootVarNum.

     -A --deactivate BootVarNum    Deactivate the given BootVarNum.

     -n --bootnext BootVarNum      Set BootVarNum as the BootNext variable.

     -N --delete-bootnext          Delete the BootNext optional BootVar.

     -o --bootorder bootorder      Set BootOrder variable to the given comma
                                   delimited set of BootVarNums.  The numbers
                                   are in hex to match BootXXXX, but may omit
                                   leading zeros.

     -t --set-timeout timeout      Set the bootmenu timeout value.

     -T --del-timeout              Delete the BootTimeout variable.

     -v --verbose                  Display the device path of BootVars in the
                                   output.

Exammples
     To Display the current Boot related variables in the system:

           efibootmgr [-v]

     This will display the optional BootNext BootVar, BootCurrent, or
     currently booted BootVar, followed by the optional Timeout value, any
     BootOrder that maybe set, followed finally by all currently defined Boot
     variables, active or not. The verbose flag will augment this output with
     the hardrive partition uuids, size/offset and device-path of the
     variable.

     The efibootmgr program can be used to create new EFI boot variables. To
     create a new boot var pointing to an installation with its EFI partition
     mounted under /mnt, the given loader and a label "FreeBSD-11":

           efibootmgr -c -l /mnt/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI -L FreeBSD-11

     This will result in the next available BootVarNum being assigned to a new
     UEFI load variable, and given the label "FreeBSD-11" such as:

           Boot0009 FreeBSD-11

     Note newly created BootVars are created inactive. The active state is
     denoted by an '*' following the BootVar name in the output.  They are
     also inserted into the first position of current BootOrder variable if it
     exists. They must first be set to active before being considered
     available to attempt booting from, else they are ignored.

           efibootmgr -B 0009

     Will delete the given BootVar Boot0009

     To set a given newly created BootVar active use:

           efibootmgr -a 0009

     To set a given BootVar to be used as the BootNext variable, irrespective
     of its active state, use:

           efibootmgr -n 0009

     To set the BootOrder for the next reboot  use:

           efibootmgr -o 0009,0003,...
