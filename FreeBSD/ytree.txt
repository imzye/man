DESCRIPTION
       If there is no command line argument, the current directory will be

              and *.h - Files

              ~/.bashrc):

              function yt

       ytree switches to archive-modus automatically either by choosing an
       archive file with the Log command or by calling ytree from the command
       line with an archive file given as a command line argument.

       ytree recognize the filename extensions ".F", ".Z", ".z" and ".gz" and
       calls the appropriate uncompressor MELT (default=melt), UNCOMPRESS
       (default=uncompress) and GNUUNZIP (default=gunzip -c). You may change
       these settings in ~/.ytree.

       ytree supports following archive types and requires:

                TAR-Files: gtar     (tested with GNU-TAR 1.12)
                ARC-Files: arc      (tested with arc 5.12 02/05/86)
                LHA-Files: xlharc   (tested with xlharc V1.02 1989)
                ZIP-Files: unzip    (tested with unzip v5.0 08/92)
                "   "      zipinfo  (tested with zipinfo v1.0 08/92)
                ZOO-Files: zoo      (tested with zoo v2.10)
                RAR-Files: unrar    (tested with unrar v2.01
                RPM-Files: rpm2cpio (tested with RedHat V6.1)
                "   "      rpm      (tested with RedHat V6.1)

       Archive files will be recognized by filename extension (e.g zoo, zip).
       TAR-Files may have following extensions:

                ".F", ".TFR", ".Faa",                            (freeze)
                ".Z", ".TZ", ".TZR", ".Xaa",                   (compress)
                ".z", ".gz", ".tzr", ".tz", ".xaa", ".tgz", ".TGZ",
                ".taz", ".TAZ", ".tpz" und ".TPZ"                  (gzip)


       The View command is customizeable in the [VIEWER] section of ~/.ytree:

       Example:

        [VIEWER]
        .jpg,.gif,.bmp,.tif,.ppm,.xpm=xv
        .1,.2,.3,.4,.5,.6,.7,.8,.n=nroff -man | less
        .ps=ghostview
        .mid,.MID=playmidi -e
        .wav,.WAV=splay
        .au=auplay
        .avi,.mpg,.mov=xanim
        .htm,.html=lynx
        .pdf,.PDF=acroread
        .mp3=mpg123

       A command-line history is supported: Use cursor up/down.  Use "F2" on
       the command-line to select directories.
