NDIS_EVENTS(8)          FreeBSD System Manager's Manual         NDIS_EVENTS(8)

NAME
     ndis_events – relay events from ndis(4) drivers to wpa_supplicant(8)

SYNOPSIS
     ndis_events [-a] [-d] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
     The ndis_events utility listens for events generated by an ndis(4)
     wireless network driver and relays them to wpa_supplicant(8) for possible
     processing.  The three event types that can occur are media connect and
     disconnect events, such as when a wireless interface joins or leaves a
     network, and media-specific events.  In particular, ndis(4) drivers that
     support WPA2 will generate media-specific events containing PMKID
     candidate information which wpa_supplicant(8) needs in order to properly
     associate with WPA2-capable access points.

     The ndis_events daemon works by listening for interface information
     events via a routing socket.  When it detects an event that was generated
     by an ndis(4) interface, it transmits it via UDP packet on the loopback
     interface, where wpa_supplicant(8) is presumably listening.  The standard
     wpa_supplicant(8) distribution includes its own version of this utility
     for use with Windows®.  The FreeBSD version performs the same functions
     as the Windows® one, except that it uses an ioctl(2) and routing socket
     interface instead of WMI.

     Note that a single instance of ndis_events is sufficient to scan for
     events for any number of ndis(4) interfaces in a system.

OPTIONS
     The ndis_events daemon supports the following options:

     -a      Process all events.  By default, ndis_events will only process
             and forward media-specific events, which contain PMKID candidate
             information, and not bother forwarding connect and disconnect
             events, since wpa_supplicant(8) normally can determine the
             current link state on its own.  In some cases, the additional
             connect and disconnect events only confuse it and make the
             association and authentication process take longer.

     -d      Run in debug mode.  This causes ndis_events to run in the
             foreground and generate any output to the standard error instead
             of using the syslog(3) facility.

     -v      Run in verbose mode.  This causes ndis_events to emit
             notifications when it receives events.
