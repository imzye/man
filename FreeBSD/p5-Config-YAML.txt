NAME
       Config::YAML - Simple configuration automation

VERSION
       Version 1.42

SYNOPSIS
       Config::YAML is a somewhat object-oriented wrapper around the YAML
       module which makes reading and writing configuration files simple.
       Handling multiple config files (e.g. system and per-user configuration,
       or a gallery app with per-directory configuration) is a snap.

           use Config::YAML;

           # create Config::YAML object with any desired initial options
           # parameters; load system config; set alternate output file
           my $c = Config::YAML->new( config => "/usr/share/foo/globalconf",
                                      output => "~/.foorc",
                                      param1 => value1,
                                      param2 => value2,
                                      ...
                                      paramN => valueN,
                                    );

           # integrate user's own config
           $c->read("~/.foorc");

           # integrate command line args using Getopt::Long
           $rc = GetOptions ( $c,
                              'param1|p!',
                              'param2|P',
                              'paramN|n',
                            );

           # Write configuration state to disk
           $c->write;

           # simply get params back for use...
           do_something() unless $c->{param1};
           # or get them more OO-ly if that makes you feel better
           my $value = $c->get_param2;

METHODS
   new
       Creates a new Config::YAML object.

           my $c = Config::YAML->new( config => initial_config,
                                      output => output_config
                                    );

       The "config" parameter specifies the file to be read in during object
       creation. It is required, and must be the first parameter given. If the
       second parameter is "output", then it is used to specify the file to
       which configuration data will later be written out.  This positional
       dependancy makes it possible to have parameters named "config" and/or
       "output" in config files.

       Initial configuration values can be passed as subsequent parameters to
       the constructor:

           my $c = Config::YAML->new( config => "~/.foorc",
                                      foo    => "abc",
                                      bar    => "xyz",
                                      baz    => [ 1, 2, 3 ],
                                    );

   get_*/set_*
       If you'd prefer not to directly molest the object to store and retrieve
       configuration data, autoloading methods of the forms "get_[param]" and
       "set_[param]" are provided. Continuing from the previous example:

           print $c->get_foo;      # prints "abc"
           my $val = $c->get_quux; # $c->{quux} doesn't exist; returns undef

           $c->set_bar(30);     # $c->{bar} now equals 30, not "xyz"
           my @list = qw(alpha beta gamma);
           $c->set_baz(\@list); # $c->{baz} now a reference to @list

   fold
       Convenience method for folding multiple values into the config object
       at once. Requires a hashref as its argument.

           $prefs{theme}  = param(theme);
           $prefs{format} = param(format);
           $prefs{sortby} = param(order);

           $c->fold(\%prefs);

           my $format = $c->get_format; # value matches that of param(format)

   read
       Imports a YAML-formatted config file.

           $c->read('/usr/share/fooapp/fooconf');

       read() is called at object creation and imports the file specified by
       new(config=>), so there is no need to call it manually unless multiple
       config files exist.

   write
       Dump current configuration state to a YAML-formatted flat file.

           $c->write;

       The file to be written is specified in the constructor call. See the
       "new" method documentation for details.

DEPRECATED METHODS
       These methods have been superceded and will likely be removed in the
       next release.

   get
       Returns the value of a parameter.

           print $c->get('foo');

   set
       Sets the value of a parameter:

           $c->set('foo',1);

           my @paints = qw( oil acrylic tempera );
           $c->set('paints', \@paints);

BUGS
       •   Config::YAML ignores the YAML document separation string ("---")
           because it has no concept of multiple targets for the data coming
           from a config file.
