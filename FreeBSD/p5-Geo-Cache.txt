NAME
       Geo::Cache - Object interface for GPS waypoints

SYNOPSIS
           use Geo::Cache;
           my $wpt = Geo::Cache->new(
               lat  => '37.99815',
               lon  => '-85.302017',
               time => $time,
               name => 'GCGVW8',
               desc => 'Neither Hill nor Dale',
               sym  => 'geocache',
               type => 'Geocache|Traditional Cache',
           );
           $wpt->url('http://www.geocaching.com/');


           my $wpt_from_xml = Geo::Cache->new( xml => $xml, );

           my $xml = $wpt->xml;

DESCRIPTION
       Provide an object interface to Geocaching.com waypoints and/or
       geocaches, using the Groundspeak GPX file as the reference for what
       fields are valid.

       Methods are provide for various of the fields that require special
       treatment.

       Three output methods are provided -- "gpx", "gpsdrive", and "loc", for
       outputting a single waypoint in one of these three formats. These can
       be used in conjunction with the "Geo::Gpx" module to produce files of
       those formats.

   new
       Create a new "Geo::Cache" object.

           my $wpt = Geo::Cache->new(
               lat  => '37.99815',
               lon  => '-85.302017',
               time => $time,
               name => 'GCGVW8',
               desc => 'Neither Hill nor Dale',
               sym  => 'geocache',
               type => 'Geocache|Traditional Cache',
           );

   Data methods
       A data method is provided for each of the valid fields within a Cache
       object. Calling the method with no argument returns the value of that
       attribute. Calling the method with an argument changes the value of
       that attribute to that value.

        my $name = $cache->name;
        $cache->lon(-84.8934);

   xml/gpx
       Returns a blob of XML which constitutes one <wpt> block of a
       Geocaching.com-style gpx data file. You'll generally not use this
       method by itself, but will call the "gpx" method from the "Geo::Gpx"
       module to generate the entire file of one or more waypoints.

       "xml" is an alias for the "gpx" method.
