NAME
       clog - tcp connection logger daemon

SYNOPSIS
       clog [-h] [-b] [-r] [-p] [-i interface ] [-o outfile ] [-f filter ]

DESCRIPTION
       clog is a program that logs all connections on your subnet.  It uses
       the pcap(3) packet capture library to log any SYN packets to a logfile.
       The output format is designed to be very easily parsed by various text
       processing tools. The logfiles have the following format:

       date|source_host|source_port|dest_host|dest_port

OPTIONS
       -b     Run clog in the background

       -r     Resolve all addressed into hostnames instead of IP addresses

       -p     Don't turn on promiscuous mode

       -i     Specify what interface to use

       -o     Specify what file to log to, default is stdout

       -f     Specify a alternate filter expression
