XFSM(1)                 FreeBSD General Commands Manual                XFSM(1)

NAME
       xfsm - monitor your file systems' status

DESCRIPTION
       xfsm stands for X File System Monitor and runs under MIT's X11 window
       system on several flavors of UNIX. It is a tool designed to make
       monitoring your file systems' status easy by displaying a simple bar
       graph for each file system greater than size 0. It updates the file
       systems' statistics at regular, user definable intervals.

COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS
       xfsm accepts the following command line options:

               +rv                     reverse video (use to override xrdb entry)
               +synchronous            syncronous mode(use to override xrdb entry)

BRIEF USER'S GUIDE
       The following abbreviations are used:

            LB      - left mouse button
            MB      - middle mouse button
            RB      - right mouse button

       Once you have started xfsm you will get a window containing at least 1
       bar graph (xfsm removes all file systems of size 0) and 2 menus. The
       Menus are:

            Update Now - updates all files systems' statistics now
            Quit       - exits xfsm

       If you click on the graph of a file system (LB, MB) you get a window
       displaying the detailed statistics for the file system.  Clicking on
       the file system again (LB, MB) or clicking in the detail window (LB,
       MB), closes the detail window while clicking on another file system
       (LB, MB) while the detail window is open, displays this file system's
       statistics in the detail window. (Check the 5th item in the
       Troubleshooting section in the documentation to see the limitations of
       the default mode of xfsm with regard to calculating percentages.)

       The right mouse button is used to toggle the display mode. The default
       startup mode graphs all file systems relative to their size. By
       clicking with the right mouse button in any of the windows, the graphs
       are drawn in absolute size. Clicking (RB) again, reverts back to the
       original mode.

       If you have specified the -w flag with a valid parameter, xfsm will
       display an exclamation mark after the file system's percent display
       when the file system's useage exceeds the specified threshold. If you
       also specified the -e option, xfsm will sound the bell when the above
       condition is true for at least 1 file system when the file systems
       statistics are updated. You can use the -wl1, -wl1c, -wl2, -wl2c, -wl3,
       -wl3c options to set additional warning levels and associate them with
       colors. A word about colors: If you use them (ie. specify forground and
       background colors) you probably want to use the -b flag to disable the
       grey fill. If you don't do this, the color of the file system bars will
       be filled using the gray tile, which IMHO looks rather horrible.

       Xfsm will recognize automount file systems. If file systems are added
       or removed after startup, they will be caught at update time. Xfsm will
       then resize the main window to enable it properly display a status bar
       for each file system. If you specify file systems to be ignored (via
       the -d or -D option) xfsm will remember these file systems even if they
       are not present at startup time. This enables you to have xfsm ignore
       file systems which are not mounted at startup time.

       The following keys can be used to control xfsm:

            q - quit xfsm
            u - update now
            t - toggle display mode
            c - close the detail window

       The Detail Window can display the following statistics. Depending on
       the system you are on, you may not get all these statistics:

            Device Name             The actual device name
            Total Size              The file system size in MB
            Space Free              Free space in MB
            Sapce Available         Space Available to non-root in MB
            Mount Type          Type of Mount
            Mount Option        Mount Options
            Block Size              The size of a block in Bytes
            Blocks                  The number of blocks
            Blocks Free             The number of free blocks
            Blocks Available        Blocks available to non-root
            File Inodes             The number of Inodes
            Free Inodes             The number of free Inodes
            Inodes Availible        Inodes available to non-root user

       If a device name is too long to be dispayed in the detail window, the
       detail window will resize to accomodate the name. This resizing will
       take place every time a file system name is too long to fit into the
       default width of the detail window. You can resize the main window but
       xfsm will not let you make the main window smaller beyond a certain
       point. This is to ensure that the output remains neat and legible. When
       the main window is not wide enough to display the entire name of a file
       system, the name will be truncated so that it does not overwrite the
       percentages.

       big.
