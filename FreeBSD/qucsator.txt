NAME
       Qucsator - An integrated electronic circuit simulator.

SYNOPSIS
       qucsator [OPTION] ...

DESCRIPTION
       Qucs is an integrated circuit simulator which means you are able to
       setup a circuit with a graphical user interface (GUI) and simulate the
       large-signal, small-signal and noise behaviour of the circuit.  After
       that simulation has finished you can view the simulation results on a
       presentation page or window.

       The software aims to support all kinds of circuit simulation types,
       e.g. DC, AC, S-parameter, harmonic balance analysis, noise analysis,
       etc.

       Qucsator, the simulation backend, is a command line circuit simulator.
       It takes a network list in a certain format as input and outputs a Qucs
       dataset.  It has been programmed for usage in the Qucs project but may
       also be used by other applications.
