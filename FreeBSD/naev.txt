NAME
       Naev - A 2D space trading and combat game.

SYNOPSIS
       naev [OPTIONS] [DATA]

DESCRIPTION
       Naev is a space trading and combat game, inspired by Escape Velocity.

       Played from a top-down perspective with isometric sprites, the player
       is free to explore the galaxy as they see fit, trading or pirating
       their way to a vast fortune.

       Naev is set in a futuristic science fiction environment, in which the
       player finds themself in the wake of a massive galactic cataclysm which
       erupted from the Sol system and destroyed everything within tens of
       light years, resulting in a massive, volatile nebula.
