NOLOGINMSG(8)           FreeBSD System Manager's Manual          NOLOGINMSG(8)

NAME
     nologinmsg – politely refuse a login

SYNOPSIS
     nologinmsg

DESCRIPTION
     Nologinmsg displays a message that an account is not availavle and exits
     non-zero.  It is intended as a replacement shell field for accounts that
     have been disabled.  It can also print per-user messages, or special
     messages, depending on how it is called, or whether it can find a better
     message to print.

     To create a per-user message, put the text of the message in
     /usr/local/etc/nologinmsgs/USER file. Its contents will be printed if the
     user names USER logs in.

     To create a message that can be used for a group of users, create a
     symbolic link to a new name for the binary, and use that name. In the
     /usr/local/etc/nologinmsgs/ directory, place a text file of the same
     name, with the text you want printed when a user with this shell name
     logs in.

     If the program name is not nologinmsg, then that file name is checked,
     and printed if that exists. If it does not, then the standard error is
     printed.  If the program name is nologinmsg, and a user named file exists
     then that file is printed if possible, if not, the standard error message
     exists.  In all other cases, the standard message is printed.

     To disable all logins, investigage nologin(5).
