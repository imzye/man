Lvalue(3)             User Contributed Perl Documentation            Lvalue(3)


NAME
       Lvalue - add lvalue getters and setters to existing objects

VERSION
       version 0.21

SYNOPSIS
       Lvalue takes an object produced by some other package and wraps it with
       lvalue functionality implemented with the object's original getter and
       setter routines.  Lvalue assumes its object uses the relatively
       standard getter / setter idiom where any arguments is a setter, and no
       arguments is a getter.

       By wrapping an existing object's getters and setters, Lvalue gives you
       the syntactic niceties of lvalues, without the inherent encapsulation
       violations of the :lvalue subroutine attribute.

           my $obj = NormalObject->new();

           $obj->value(5);

           print $obj->value(); # prints 5

           use Lvalue;

           Lvalue->wrap( $obj );

           $obj->value = 10;

           print $obj->value;   # prints 10

           $_ += 2 for $obj->value;

           print $obj->value;   # prints 12

EXPORT
       this module does not export anything by default but can export the
       functions below (which can all also be called as methods of Lvalue)

           use Lvalue qw/lvalue/; # or 'wrap', also 'unwrap'/'rvalue'

           lvalue my $obj = SomePackage->new;

           $obj->value = 5;

           Lvalue->unwrap( $obj );

           $obj->value = 6; # dies

FUNCTIONS
       "wrap OBJECT"
       "lvalue OBJECT"
           wrap an object with lvalue getters / setters

               my $obj = Lvalue->wrap( SomePackage->new );

           or in a constructor:

               sub new {
                   my $class = shift;
                   my $self  = {@_};
                   Lvalue->wrap( bless $self => $class );
               }

           in void context, an in-place modification is done:

               my $obj = SomePackage->new;

               Lvalue->wrap( $obj );

               $obj->value = 5;

           the alias " lvalue " is provided for " wrap " which when you export
           it as a function, can lead to some nice code:

               use NormalObject;
               use Lvalue 'lvalue';

               lvalue my $obj = NormalObject->new;

               $obj->value = 5;

       "unwrap LVALUE_OBJECT"
       "rvalue LVALUE_OBJECT"
           returns the original object

BUGS
       special care is taken to ensure that overloaded objects still work
       properly.  if you encounter an error please let me know.
