Net::PubSubHubbub::Publisher(3)            User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Net::PubSubHubbub::Publisher - client library to ping a PubSubHubbub
       hub

OVERVIEW
         my $pub = Net::PubSubHubbub::Publisher->new(hub => $hub);
         $pub->publish_update($atom_topic_url) or
             die "Ping failed: " . $pub->last_response->status_line;

CONSTRUCTOR
       "new"(hub => $hub[, ua => $ua])
           Takes a required hub URL, and an optional LWP::UserAgent instance.

METHODS
       "publish_update"($topic_url)
       "publish_update"(@topic_urls)
           Sends a ping that the provided Topic URL(s) has/have been updated.

           Returns true on success.  If false, see "last_response" to figure
           out why it failed.

       "last_response"()
           Returns the last HTTP::Response.  Use this when "publish_update"
           fails to discover why it failed.
