NAME
     addr2line – translate program addresses to source file names and line
     numbers

SYNOPSIS
     addr2line [-a | --addresses] [-b target | --target=target]
               [-e pathname | --exe=pathname] [-f | --functions]
               [-i | --inlines] [-j sectionname | --section=sectionname]
               [-p | --pretty-print] [-s | --basename] [-C | --demangle]
               [-H | --help] [-V | --version] [hexaddress...]

DESCRIPTION
     The addr2line utility translates program addresses specified by the
     command line arguments hexaddress to their corresponding source file
     names and line numbers.  If no arguments are given to addr2line, it will
     read these addresses from standard input.

     Program addresses specified by arguments hexaddress are encoded using the
     conventions accepted by strtoull(3).

     By default, addr2line will use the executable “a.out”.  The -e option may
     be used to specified a different ELF object.

     The addr2line utility recognizes the following options:

     -a | --addresses
             Display the address prior to the line number information.

     -b target | --target=target
             This option is recognized by addr2line but is ignored.  It is
             supported for compatibility with GNU binutils.

     -e pathname | --exe=pathname
             Use the ELF object specified by argument pathname to translate
             addresses.  If this option is not specified, addr2line will use
             the file “a.out”.

     -f | --functions
             Display function names in addition to file and line number
             information.

     -i | --inlines
             If the address specified belongs to an inlined function, also
             display the line number information for its caller, recursively
             until the first non-inlined caller.

     -j sectionname | --section=sectionname
             The values specified by arguments hexaddress are to be treated as
             offsets into the section named sectionname.

     -p | --pretty-print
             Display the line number information on one line, in human
             readable manner.

     -s | --basename
             Display only the base name for each file name.

     -C | --demangle
             Demangle C++ names.

     -H | --help
             Print a help message.

     -V | --version
             Print a version identifier and exit.

OUTPUT FORMAT
     If the -f option was not specified, addr2line will print the file name
     and line number for each address specified on a separate line.

     If the -f option was specified, addr2line will print a line containing
     the name of the function corresponding to program address hexaddress,
     followed by a line with the file name and line number.

     If the -p option was specified, addr2line will print line number
     information and function name on one line in human readable manner. If
     the -i option was also specified, addr2line will print the caller
     function information prefixed with “(inlined by)”.

     The addr2line utility prints the file name and line number using the
     format “FILENAME:LINENUMBER”.

     If a file or function name could not be determined, addr2line will print
     a question mark in their place.  If the line number could not be
     determined, addr2line will print a zero in its place.

EXAMPLES
     To map address 080483c4 in the default executable a.out to a source file
     name and line number use:
           % addr2line 080483c4

     To map address 080483c4 in executable helloworld, use:
           % addr2line -e helloworld 080483c4

     To have addr2line act as a filter reading addresses from its standard
     input use:
           % addr2line

     To print the function name corresponding to an address in addition to its
     source file and line number use:
           % addr2line -f 080483c4

EXIT STATUS
     The addr2line utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
