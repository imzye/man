NAME
       w3mfix - fixup program for w3mir

SYNOPSIS
       w3mfix [options] [configuration-file]

DESCRIPTION
       w3mfix is the companion program to w3mir.  It can be used for several
       URL editing operations usefull in different situations.

       When starting w3mfix will read it's configuration file.  It's name is
       either .w3mirc (w3mir.ini on win32) or specified on the commandline.

       w3mfix is controlled by the 'Fixup' directive of the configuration file
       (described in the w3mir documentation).  w3mfix is also affected by
       'Index-name' and the one special commandline option it knows, as well
       as the directives/options controlling verbosity and debugging
       information.

DESCRIPTION
       w3mfix can rewrite URLs in these ways:

       •   Rewrite URLs that resutled in redirects to point to the place
           redirected to.  This is needed in all cases and will always be
           fixed by w3mfix.

       •   Change URLs ending in .../ into .../index.html (or
           .../Welcome.html).  This is, probably, not needed when the mirror
           is meant do be used with a web-server.  It is usefull for browsing
           directly from disk or CDROM, but in this case it's, most often,
           required.  To disable this specify the noindex option with the
           'Fixup' directive.

           The default is to transform URLs ending in .../ into
           .../index.html.

           To controll the name of the index file use the Index-name directive
           as documented in w3mir

       •   Change URL links to documents outside the mirror to point to some
           local document.  Could be usefull if the mirror is destined for a
           CDROM to be used on a unconnected machine.

           THIS IS NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

       •   Change URL links to documents that w3mir was unable/forbidden to
           retrive to point to some local document.  Pointing these to a nice
           informative document is probably better than random error messages
           from the browser.

           THIS IS NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

       •   And, least, but far from last, w3mfix can be used to prepare an
           established mirror for enlargement.

           This feature is used thus: Add the new site or subsite to be
           mirrored on the configuration file (by adding Also: and Also-quene:
           directives).  Then run w3mfix with the -editref option.  When the
           -editref option is specified w3mfix will not perform any other
           editing tasks.

           E.g.; To add http://www.yahoo.com/Science/Artificial_Life/ to your
           mirror add something like

                     Also: http://www.yahoo.com/Science/Artificial_Life/ yahoo

           to the configuration file, then run w3mfix:

                     w3mfix -editref www.yahoo.com/Science/Artificial_Life

           This will cause all references to
           www.yahoo.com/Science/Artificial_Life (and under) to be edited so
           they point to within the mirror.  After w3mfix has finished you can
           run w3mir in the normal manner.

BUGS
       Naah.
