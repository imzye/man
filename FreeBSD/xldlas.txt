NAME
       xldlas -- A Program for Statistics


SYNOPSIS
       xldlas [-h] [-help] [--help] [-v] [-version] [--version] [-display
       displayname] [-private] [-shared] [-stdcmap] [-double] [-log
       logfilename] [-tlog texlogfilename] [-hlog htmllogfilename] [-icol
       importfilename] [-irow importfilename] [datafile]


DESCRIPTION
       xldlas is a basic statistical package that runs under the X Window
       System and is built around the XForms library. Details of use are
       available from within the program (see the Help menu). Command line
       options are summarized below.


OPTIONS
       All options are just that (ie. optional).


       -h, -help, --help
              Make xldlas display help on usage via the command line instead
              of starting up normally.


       -v, -version, --version
              Make xldlas display version information via the command line
              instead of starting up normally.


       -display displayname
              Make xldlas open its displays on the X display specified by
              displayname. The default is 0:0.


       -private
              Force xldlas to use a private colourmap. This option would
              almost never be used, since the default behaviour is to use a
              private colour map if there are not enough colours available.


       -shared
              Force xldlas to share colours. This option is useful if you are
              running on a display with limited colours and want to prevent
              "flashing".


       -stdcmp
              Tell xldlas you want it to use a standard colourmap.


       -double
              This sets double-buffering on all graphic elements, resulting in
              smoother (but slower) updating.


       -log logfilename
              Ask xldlas to open a regular (ASCII) log file upon startup with
              the name specified by logfilename.


       -tlog texlogfilename
              Ask xldlas to open a TeX format log file upon startup with the
              name specified by texlogfilename.


       -hlog htmllogfilename
              Ask xldlas to open an HTML format log file upon startup with the
              name specified by htmllogfilename.


       -icol importfilename
              Ask xldlas to import column-format ascii data upon startup from
              the file specified by htmllogfilename.


       -irow importfilename
              Ask xldlas to import row-format ascii data upon startup from the
              file specified by htmllogfilename.


       datafile
              Upon startup, load the dataset stored in a .lda format datafile
              specified by datafile into xldlas.
