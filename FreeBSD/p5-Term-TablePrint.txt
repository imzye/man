NAME
       Term::TablePrint - Print a table to the terminal and browse it
       interactively.

VERSION
       Version 0.173

SYNOPSIS
           my $table = [ [ 'id', 'name' ],
                         [    1, 'Ruth' ],
                         [    2, 'John' ],
                         [    3, 'Mark' ],
                         [    4, 'Nena' ], ];

           use Term::TablePrint qw( print_table );

           print_table( $table );

           # or OO style:

           use Term::TablePrint;

           my $pt = Term::TablePrint->new();
           $pt->print_table( $table );

DESCRIPTION
       "print_table" shows a table and lets the user interactively browse it.
       It provides a cursor which highlights the row on which it is located.
       The user can scroll through the table with the different cursor keys.

   KEYS
       Keys to move around:

       •   the "ArrowDown" key (or the "j" key) to move down and  the
           "ArrowUp" key (or the "k" key) to move up.

       •   the "PageUp" key (or "Ctrl-P") to go to the previous page, the
           "PageDown" key (or "Ctrl-N") to go to the next page.

       •   the "Insert" key to go back 10 pages, the "Delete" key to go
           forward 10 pages.

       •   the "Home" key (or "Ctrl-A") to jump to the first row of the table,
           the "End" key (or "Ctrl-E") to jump to the last row of the table.

       If table_expand is set to 0, the "Enter" key closes the table if the
       cursor is on the first row.

       If table_expand is enabled and the cursor is on the first row, pressing
       "Enter" three times in succession closes the table. If the cursor is
       auto-jumped to the first row, it is required only one "Enter" to close
       the table.

       If the cursor is not on the first row:

       •   with the option table_expand disabled the cursor jumps to the table
           head if "Enter" is pressed.

       •   with the option table_expand enabled each column of the selected
           row is output in its own line preceded by the column name if
           "Enter" is pressed. Another "Enter" closes this output and goes
           back to the table output. If a row is selected twice in succession,
           the pointer jumps to the first row.

       If the size of the window has changed, the screen is rewritten as soon
       as the user presses a key.

       "Ctrl-F" opens a prompt. A regular expression is expected as input.
       This enables one to only display rows where at least one column matches
       the entered pattern. See option "search".

   Output
       If the option "table_expand" is enabled and a row is selected with
       "Enter", each column of that row is output in its own line preceded by
       the column name.

       If the table has more rows than the terminal, the table is divided up
       on as many pages as needed automatically. If the cursor reaches the end
       of a page, the next page is shown automatically until the last page is
       reached. Also if the cursor reaches the topmost line, the previous page
       is shown automatically if it is not already the first page.

       For the output on the screen the table elements are modified. All the
       modifications are made on a copy of the original table data.

       •   If an element is not defined the value from the option undef is
           assigned to that element.

       •   Each character tabulation ("\t") is replaces with a space.

       •   Vertical tabulations ("\v+") are squashed to two spaces.

       •   Code points from the ranges of "control", "surrogate" and
           "noncharacter" are removed.

       •   If the option squash_spaces is enabled leading and trailing spaces
           are removed and multiple consecutive spaces are squashed to a
           single space.

       •   If an element looks like a number it is right-justified, else it is
           left-justified.

       If the terminal is too narrow to print the table, the columns are
       adjusted to the available width automatically.

       •   First, if the option trunc_fract_first is enabled and if there are
           numbers that have a fraction, the fraction is truncated up to two
           decimal places.

       •   Then columns wider than min_col_width are trimmed. See option
           "min_col_width".

       •   If it is still required to lower the row width all columns are
           trimmed until they fit into the terminal.

METHODS
   new
       The "new" method returns a "Term::TablePrint" object. As an argument it
       can be passed a reference to a hash which holds the options - the
       available options are listed in "OPTIONS".

           my $tp = Term::TablePrint->new( \%options );

   print_table
       The "print_table" method prints the table passed with the first
       argument.

           $tp->print_table( $array_ref, \%options );

       The first argument is a reference to an array of arrays. The first
       array of these arrays holds the column names. The following arrays are
       the table rows where the elements are the field values.

       As a second and optional argument a hash reference can be passed which
       holds the options - the available options are listed in "OPTIONS".

SUBROUTINES
   print_table
       The "print_table" subroutine prints the table passed with the first
       argument.

           print_table( $array_ref, \%options );

       The subroutine "print_table" takes the same arguments as the method
       "print_table".

   OPTIONS
       binary_filter

       How to print arbitrary binary data:

       0 - print the binary data as it is

       1 - "BNRY" is printed instead of the binary data

       2 - the binary data is printed in hexadecimal format

       If the substring of the first 100 characters of the data matches the
       repexp "/[\x00-\x08\x0B-\x0C\x0E-\x1F]/", the data is considered
       arbitrary binary data.

       Printing unfiltered arbitrary binary data could break the output.

       Default: 0

       codepage_mapping

       This option has only meaning if the operating system is MSWin32.

       If the OS is MSWin32, Win32::Console::ANSI is used. By default
       "Win32::Console::ANSI" converts the characters from Windows code page
       to DOS code page (the so-called ANSI to OEM conversion). This
       conversation is disabled by default in "Term::Choose" but one can
       enable it by setting this option.

       Setting this option to 1 enables the codepage mapping offered by
       Win32::Console::ANSI.

       0 - disable automatic codepage mapping

       1 - keep automatic codepage mapping

       Default: 0

       color

       Enable the support for ANSI SGR escape sequences.

       0 - off (default)

       1 - enabled except for the current selected row

       2 - enabled

       Colors are reset to normal after the end of each table field.

       Numbers with added escape sequences are aligned to the left.

       Default: 0

       decimal_separator

       Set the decimal separator. Numbers with a decimal separator are
       formatted as number if this option is set to the right value.

       Allowed values: a character with a print width of 1. If an invalid
       values is passed, decimal_separator falls back to the default value.

       Default: . (dot)

       footer

       If set (string), footer is added in the bottom line to the page number.
       It is up to the user to add leading and trailing separators.

       If a footer string is passed with this option, the option page is
       automatically set to 2.

       Default: undef

       info

       Expects as its value a string. The info text is printed above the
       prompt string.

       Default: undef

       max_rows

       Set the maximum number of used table rows. The used table rows are kept
       in memory.

       max_rows does not include the header row: max_rows set to 3 would print
       the header row plus 3 table rows.

       To disable the automatic limit, do not set "max_rows" or set "max_rows"
       to "undef". Setting "max_rows" to 0 could mean in a future release to
       limit the output to 0 data rows.

       If the number of table rows is higher than max_rows, the last row of
       the output tells that the limit has been reached.

       Default: 0

       max_width_exp

       Set a maximum width of the expanded table row output. (See option
       "table_expand").

       min_col_width

       The columns with a width below or equal min_col_width are only trimmed,
       if it is still required to lower the row width despite all columns
       wider than min_col_width have been trimmed to min_col_width.

       Default: 30

       mouse

       Set the mouse mode (see option "mouse" in "OPTIONS" in Term::Choose).

       Default: 0

       pad_row_edges

       Add a space at the beginning and end of each row.

       0 - off (default)

       1 - enabled

       progress_bar

       Set the progress bar threshold. If the number of fields (rows x
       columns) is higher than the threshold, a progress bar is shown while
       preparing the data for the output.

       Default: 40_000

       prompt

       String displayed above the table.

       search

       Set the behavior of "Ctrl-F".

       0 - off

       1 - case-insensitive search

       2 - case-sensitive search

       When "Ctrl-F" is pressed and a regexp is entered, the regexp is
       appended to the end of the footer.

       Default: 1

       squash_spaces

       If squash_spaces is enabled, consecutive spaces are squashed to one
       space and leading and trailing spaces are removed.

       Default: 0

       tab_width

       Set the number of spaces between columns.

       Default: 2

       table_expand

       If table_expand is enabled and "Enter" is pressed, the selected table
       row prints with each column on a new line.  Pressing "Enter" again
       closes this view. The next "Enter" key press will automatically jump
       the cursor to the first row. If the cursor has automatically jumped to
       the first row, pressing "Enter" will close the table instead of
       expanding the first row. Pressing any key other than "Enter" resets
       these special behaviors.

       If table_expand is set to 0, the cursor jumps to the to first row (if
       not already there) when "Enter" is pressed.

       0 - off

       1 - on

       Default: 1

       trunc_fract_first

       If the terminal width is not wide enough and this option is enabled,
       the first step to reduce the width of the columns is to truncate the
       fraction part of numbers to 2 decimal places.

       undef

       Set the string that will be shown on the screen instead of an undefined
       field.

       Default: "" (empty string)
