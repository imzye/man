LADVD(8)                FreeBSD System Manager's Manual               LADVD(8)

NAME
       ladvd - send link layer advertisements

SYNOPSIS
       ladvd [ -a ] [ INTERFACE ] [ INTERFACE ] ...

DESCRIPTION
       ladvd sends LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol) advertisements on all
       available interfaces. This makes connected hosts visible on managed
       switches. By default it will run as a privilege-separated daemon.
       Additional protocols can be enabled using the -C, -E, -F and -N
       options. Optionally a list of interfaces which ladvd should utilize can
       be supplied. Please note that only physical or bond/bridge interfaces
       can be specified, vlan interfaces can only be auto-detected.

INTERFACES
       ladvd detects and uses all configured (UP) physical Ethernet interfaces
       by default, wireless interfaces can be enabled via the -w option.
       Additionally ladvd will recognize bundled interfaces (bridges, bonding)
       and use these to transmit additional information. The result is that
       normally it should not be necessary to specify interfaces on the ladvd
       command-line. The only reason for specifying interfaces is to
       explicitly exclude a particular interface.

OPTIONS
       -a     Auto-enable protocols based on received packets (also enables
              receive mode).

       -d     Dump pcap-compatible packets to stdout which can be piped to
              tcpdump (via "| tcpdump -r -") or redirected to a file for
              further analysis.

       -e interface
              Exclude a particular interface, no packets will be transmitted
              on this interface.

       -f     Run in the foreground and send logging to stderr.

       -h     Print usage instructions.

       -m interface
              The management interface for this host. Addresses on this
              interface are auto-detected (IPv4 and IPv6).

       -n     Use addresses of the management interface specified via -m for
              all interfaces.

       -o     Run only once, useful for quick troubleshooting.

       -r     Receive packets, and use them for various features.

       -s     Be silent, don't transmit any packets.

       -q     Use each interface's hwaddr the generate the chassis-id TLV. Not
              recommended because the chassis-id should be the same for all
              interfaces.

       -t     Use Tun/Tap interfaces.

       -u user
              Switch to this user (defaults to ladvd)

       -v     Increase logging verbosity.

       -w     Use wireless interfaces.

       -y     Save received peer hostname and port description in interface
              descriptions (requires SIOCSIFDESCR support) or Linux ifAliases.
              This also enables receive mode.

       -z     Save received peer hostname and port name in interface
              descriptions (requires SIOCSIFDESCR support) or Linux ifAliases.
              This also enables receive mode.

       -c <CC>
              Specify a two-letter ISO 3166 country code (required for LLDP
              location support).

       -l <location>
              Specify the physical location of the host.

       -L     Enable LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol).

       -C     Enable CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol).

       -E     Enable EDP (Extreme Discovery Protocol).

       -F     Enable FDP (Foundry Discovery Protocol).

       -N     Enable NDP (Nortel Discovery Protocol) formerly called SynOptics
              Network Management Protocol (SONMP).
