     mgp – MagicPoint -- an X11 based presentation tool

SYNOPSIS
     mgp [-dhlnoqvBCGORSV] [-b bgcolor] [-c vfcap] [-f vfont] [-g geometry]
         [-p page] [-t timeslot] [-w wdir] [-x engine] [-D htmldir]

         [-X gsdevice] file

DESCRIPTION
     mgp is an X11 based presentation tool.  It is designed to make simple
     presentations easy while to make complicated presentations possible.  Its
     presentation file (whose suffix is typically .mgp) is just text so that
     you can create presentation files quickly with your favorite editor (such
     as Emacs).

     The .mgp file consists of text and control commands (such as pagebreak,
     centering, and/or inline image).  Control commands are specified on the
     beginning of lines started with one % sign.  You can include numerous
     kinds of image format files onto the presentation file.

     mgp uses Japanese/English fonts in various sizes.  mgp uses X11 scalable
     fonts provided by X11 servers.  mgp can also utilize the Japanese outline
     font library, "VFlib", if configured to do so at compilation time.

     The following options are available:

     -b bgcolor
             Set background color to bgcolor.  (The default value is black)

     -c vfcap
             Specify a VFlib configuration file.

     -d [interval]
             Demonstration mode.  Browse all page automatically, spending
             interval secounds on each page and terminate. If interval is not
             specified, it will be set to 0.

     -f vfont
             Specify the font name to be used by VFlib.  (The default value is
             minsl)

     -g geometry
             Set the size and location of the window.  Please note that -g
             implies -o. mgp will not override the window manager if you
             specify the geometry.

     -h      Display the usage and exit without performing a presentation.

     -l      There are two kind of fonts available by VFlib; They are outline
             font and bitmap font.  By specifying -l, you can disable the use
             of outline fonts.

     -n      mgp accepts any key inputs from invoked terminal as KEY OPERATION
             described below.  -n disables this feature.  (This option may be
             removed in the future release)

     -o      Do not override window manager.  (By default, mgp overrides
             window manager and occupies the whole display)

     -p page
             Start presentation from page, rather than the first page.

     -q      Do not beep on errors.

     -t timeslot
             Specify the timeslot assigned to the presentation in minute.  The
             timer is invoked when the second page is displayed and the
             remaining presentation time is indicated by the length of bar
             shown at the bottom of the display.  The timebar is updated when
             some X11 event is raised, for instance some keypress.  Timebar
             will be green if you have more than 50% of the timeslot, yellow
             while you have more than 30% of the timeslot, and red for the
             other cases.  When the assigned timeslot is expired, exceeding
             time is also shown as a timebar growing from left to right.
             Current page is indicated by the position of a small vertical
             bar; the vertical bar is drawn at the leftend when the first page
             is displayed while the bar is drawn at the rightend when the last
             page is displayed.

     --title name
             Set the title of the window to name.

     -v      Display the MagicPoint version and exit without performing a
             presentation.

     -w wdir
             specifies the working directory used for store embedded images if
             any.  To generate an embedded MGP file, use mgpembed(1).

     -x engine
             Do not use rendering engine, specified by engine.  engine can be
             VFlib or FreeType.

     -B      Omit background image.

     -C      Use private colormap.

     -D htmldir
             Generate html pages of the presentation into htmldir.  You will
             need xwintoppm(1) (included in mgp kit), and pnmscale(1),
             cjpeg(1), and djpeg(1) (included in netpbm and Independent Jpeg
             Group jpeg package).

     -E htmlimage
             Specifies html image type. Now "jpg" and "png" are supported.
             default value is "jpg". It works when -D option is set.

     -F mode,effect,value
             Specifies forward page cache options.  Mode, effect and value are
             numbers.  Mode specifies caching mode.  Mode 0 means caching is
             executed after 2 seconds idle.  Mode 1 means caching is executed
             immediately.  Effect specifies 'special effect' for the forward
             page cache. Currently, two special effects are supported.  Effect
             1 means that the next page will come in from the left side.
             Effect 2 means that the current page will go out to the left
             side.  Effect 0 means no special effect.  Value specifies speed
             of special effect.  Value 1 means the highest speed. A higher
             value for value decreases effect speed.

     -G      Specifies to turn on page guide function.  At the bottom of the
             screen, the titles of next page and previous page are displayed
             to assist the presentation.  Page guide can be turned on and off
             by keyboard too.

     -O      Obey to the window manager, but with less decoration around the
             window.  The behavior of this option is affected by how the
             window manager is implemented; this option may have no effect on
             some of the window managers.

     -Q quality
             Set background image quality(0-100).

     -R      mgp will usually reload the presentation file if it gets updated,
             based on the file modification time taken by stat(2).  -R
             disables this auto-reloading feature.

     -S      Be secure.  Skip directives that fork/exec the child process.  It
             is suggested to use this option if you got some presentation file
             from others.  This is enabled by default.

     -U      Be unsecure.  Enable directives that fork/exec the child process.
             Allow to use non-ASCII filename.

     -T timestampfile
             If the option is specified, mgp will modify the content of
             timestampfile every time it updates the presentation window.
             This option is useful for external process to understand when mgp
             modifies the window.

     -V      Be verbose.  Generate debugging output to standard output.

     -X gsdevice
             mgp sometimes invokes ghostscript(1) to render postscript images.
             -X enables you to specify the device to be used by
             ghostscript(1).  If you specify gsdevice with a trailing '+',
             pnmscale(1) and pnmdepth(1) will be invoked for anti-aliasing.
             The default gsdevice is "pnmraw+".

KEY OPERATION
     The keyboard/mouse commands are:

     mouse button 1 (leftmost button)
             Go forward a page.  Space key, downward cursor key, scroll down
             key, "f" key, "j" key, and "n" key have the same effect.  If
             <number> is specified, go forward <number> pages.

     mouse button 3 (rightmost button)
             Go to the previous page.  "b" key, "k" key, "p" key, backspace
             key, scroll up key and upward cursor key have the same effect.
             If <number> is specified, go back <number> pages.

     0 - 9 (number buttons)
             Set prefix number in decimal.  i.e. <number> = <number> * 10 +
             <keyN> - <key0>.  For example, by typing in "10g" you can jump to
             page 10.

     g       Go to the <number> page.  If number of 0 is specified, go to the
             last page.

     control key
             Display the page listing menu.  See below for details.

     G       Enable/disable page guide.  See description for option -G for
             details.

     x       Enable/disable rakugaki (jotting) mode.  You can make an
             annotation (by mouse) on the presentation.  Mouse button 2
             (middle) has the same effect.

     X       Change the pen color for rakugaki (jotting) mode.

     t       Enable/disable the timebar if -t timeslot option is specified.

     c       Enable/disable forward page cache.

     w       Toggle full screen mode with EWMH.  (You need a EWMH-aware window
             manager and need to run mgp with -o or -g option)

     control-L
             Repaint the current page.  Use this if you messed up the page by
             jotting too much.

     control-R
             Reload the current presentation file.  If the current page
             becomes unavailable, page pointer will be moved back to 1.

     escape key
             Quit the currently running mgp.  "q" key also has the same
             effect.

     During the presentation, you can see the page list at the bottom of the
     window when you press a Control Key.  Choosing a page with the mouse and
     clicking it with the leftmost mouse button, you can go to corresponding
     page directly.  Releasing the Control Key, the page list disappears and
     you can continue with the current page.  This function is useful during
     the Q-and-A period after your presentation completes.

CONFIGURATION FILES
     mgp will look at a file named ~/.mgprc in your home directory. The path
     to this file can be overriden with the environment variable MGPRC.  The
     content of the file must be a limited set of magicpoint directives, one
     directive per line, without % sign.  Lines start with #, or empty lines,
     will be silently ignored.  See SYNTAX for eligible directives.

     mgp imports various image draw functions from xloadimage(1).  This means
     that the location of image files can be specified by ~/.xloadimagerc
     file.  If you specify the presentation file with its directory, that
     directory is searched first and then the path specified in the
     ~/.xloadimagerc is searched.

ENVIRONMENT
     MGPRC   Full path of the configuration file. When unset, ~/.mgprc is
             used.

SECURITY ISSUES
     The presentation file can include directives to call the external
     process, just like shell process.  Therefore, the presentation file
     should be treated just like shell script or perl script.  This is
     STRONGLY recommended to review the content of the presentation file
     before invoking mgp, if you got the file from others.  By adding the -S
     option to the command line argument, directives that call external
     processes will be skipped.
