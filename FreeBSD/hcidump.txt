HCIDUMP(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             HCIDUMP(1)

NAME
     hcidump – Parse HCI data

SYNOPSIS
     hcidump [-h]
     hcidump [-aRtx] [-i HCI_node] [-p PSM] [-r file] [-s length] [-w file]
             [filter]

DESCRIPTION
     hcidump reads raw HCI data coming from and going to a Bluetooth device
     (which can be specified with the option -i, default is all available
     devices) and prints to screen commands, events and data in a human-
     readable form.  Optionally, the dump can be written to a file rather than
     parsed, and the dump file can be parsed in a subsequent moment.

OPTIONS
     -a      For every packet, not only is the packet type displayed, but also
             all data in ASCII format.

     -h      Prints usage info and exits.

     -i HCI_node
             Data is read from the specified device.  If not specified, and if
             -r option is not set, data is read from the all available
             Bluetooth devices.

     -p PSM  Sets default Protocol Service Multiplexer (PSM) to specified
             value.

     -R      Raw mode: do not display packet type, only data.

     -r file
             Data is not read from a Bluetooth device, but from the specified
             file.  The file can be created with option -w.

     -s length
             Sets max length of processed packets.

     -t      Prepend a time stamp to every packet.

     -w file
             Parsed output is not printed to screen, instead data read from
             the device are saved into the specified file.  The saved dump
             file can be subsequently parsed with option -r.

     -x      For every packet, not only is the packet type displayed, but also
             all data in hex format.

FILTERS
     Filter is a space-separated list of packet categories: available
     categories are bnep, cmtp, hci, hidp, l2cap, rfcomm, sco and sdp.  If
     filters are used, only packets belonging to the specified categories are
     dumped.  By default, all packets are dumped.
