Net::Telnet::Cisco::IOS(3)                 User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Net::Telnet::Cisco::IOS -- Manage Cisco IOS Devices

DESCRIPTION
       Net::Telnet::Cisco::IOS (NTCI) is an extension of Joshua Kereos's
       Net::Telnet::Cisco module and provides an easy way to manage and
       monitor Cisco IOS devices.  I'll mention this a lot, but make sure you
       read up on Net::Telnet::Cisco for a lot of information.

WHEN TO USE NTCI
       NTCI can do a lot, but it's not the best way to do all of it.  I'd
       suggest you take a look at some SNMP solutions.  It's up to you to
       figure out when and where you want to use it, but don't say I didn't
       warn you.  :)

METHODS
       There are way too many methods to list here, so head over to
       http://ntci.sourceforge.net for a full list with documentation.

SYNOPSIS
               use Net::Telnet::Cisco:IOS;

               # Connect and login
               $connection = Net::Telnet::Cisco::IOS->new( Host => 'hostname');
               $connection->login( Name => 'username', Password => 'password'  );

               # Get the IOS version
               if ( $ver = $connection->getIOSVer() )  {
                       print "The device is running version " . $ver . "\n";
               }
               else  {
                       print "Can't get the version:\n";
                       print $connection->errmsg();
               }

               # Close the connection
               $connection->close();
