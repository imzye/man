P_CANSEE(9)            FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual           P_CANSEE(9)

NAME
     p_cansee – determine visibility of a process

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <sys/proc.h>

     int
     p_cansee(struct thread *td, struct proc *p);

DESCRIPTION
     This function can be used to determine if a given process p is visible to
     the thread td, where the notion of “visibility” may be read as “awareness
     of existence”.

     The function is implemented using cr_cansee(9), and the dependencies on
     sysctl(8) variables documented in the cr_cansee(9) manual page apply.

RETURN VALUES
     The p_cansee() function returns 0 if the process denoted by p is visible
     by thread td, or a non-zero error return value otherwise.

ERRORS
     [ESRCH]            Process p is not visible to thread td as determined by
                        cr_cansee(9).

     [ESRCH]            Thread td has been jailed and process p does not
                        belong to the same jail as td.

     [ESRCH]            The MAC subsystem denied visibility.
