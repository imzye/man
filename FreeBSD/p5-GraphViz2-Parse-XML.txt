GraphViz2::Parse::XML(3)                   User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       GraphViz2::Parse::XML - Visualize XML as a graph

Synopsis
               #!/usr/bin/env perl

               use strict;
               use warnings;

               use File::Spec;

               use GraphViz2;
               use GraphViz2::Parse::XML;

               my($graph) = GraphViz2 -> new
                       (
                        edge   => {color => 'grey'},
                        global => {directed => 1},
                        graph  => {rankdir => 'TB'},
                        node   => {color => 'blue', shape => 'oval'},
                       );
               my($g) = GraphViz2::Parse::XML -> new(graph => $graph);

               $g -> create(file_name => File::Spec -> catfile('t', 'sample.xml') );

               my($format)      = shift || 'svg';
               my($output_file) = shift || File::Spec -> catfile('html', "parse.xml.pp.$format");

               $graph -> run(format => $format, output_file => $output_file);

       See scripts/parse.xml.pp.pl ("Scripts Shipped with this Module" in
       GraphViz2).

Description
       Takes an XML file and converts it into a graph, using the pure-Perl
       XML::Tiny.

       You can write the result in any format supported by Graphviz
       <http://www.graphviz.org/>.

       Here is the list of output formats
       <http://www.graphviz.org/content/output-formats>.

Constructor and Initialization
   Calling new()
       new() is called as "my($obj) = GraphViz2::Parse::XML -> new(k1 => v1,
       k2 => v2, ...)".

       It returns a new object of type "GraphViz2::Parse::XML".

       Key-value pairs accepted in the parameter list:

       o graph => $graphviz_object
           This option specifies the GraphViz2 object to use. This allows you
           to configure it as desired.

           The default is GraphViz2 -> new. The default attributes are the
           same as in the synopsis, above.

           This key is optional.

Methods
   create(file_name => $file_name)
       Creates the graph, which is accessible via the graph() method, or via
       the graph object you passed to new().

       Returns $self for method chaining.

       $file_name is the name of an XML file.

   graph()
       Returns the graph object, either the one supplied to new() or the one
       created during the call to new().

FAQ
       See "FAQ" in GraphViz2 and "Scripts Shipped with this Module" in
       GraphViz2.

Scripts Shipped with this Module
   scripts/parse.xml.pp.pl
       Demonstrates using XML::Tiny to parse XML.

       Inputs from ./t/sample.xml, and outputs to ./html/parse.xml.pp.svg by
       default.

Thanks
       Many thanks are due to the people who chose to make Graphviz
       <http://www.graphviz.org/> Open Source.

       And thanks to Leon Brocard <http://search.cpan.org/~lbrocard/>, who
       wrote GraphViz, and kindly gave me co-maint of the module.
