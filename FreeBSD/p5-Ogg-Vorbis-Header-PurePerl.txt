NAME
       Ogg::Vorbis::Header::PurePerl - An object-oriented interface to Ogg
       Vorbis information and comment fields, implemented entirely in Perl.
       Intended to be a drop in replacement for Ogg::Vobis::Header.

       Unlike Ogg::Vorbis::Header, this module will go ahead and fill in all
       of the information fields as soon as you construct the object.  In
       other words, the "new" and "load" constructors have identical behavior.

SYNOPSIS
               use Ogg::Vorbis::Header::PurePerl;
               my $ogg = Ogg::Vorbis::Header::PurePerl->new("song.ogg");
               while (my ($k, $v) = each %{$ogg->info}) {
                       print "$k: $v\n";
               }
               foreach my $com ($ogg->comment_tags) {
                       print "$com: $_\n" foreach $ogg->comment($com);
               }

DESCRIPTION
       This module is intended to be a drop in replacement for
       Ogg::Vorbis::Header, implemented entirely in Perl.  It provides an
       object-oriented interface to Ogg Vorbis information and comment fields.
       (NOTE: This module currently supports only read operations).

CONSTRUCTORS
   "new ($filename)"
       Opens an Ogg Vorbis file, ensuring that it exists and is actually an
       Ogg Vorbis stream.  This method does not actually read any of the
       information or comment fields, and closes the file immediately.

   "load ([$filename])"
       Opens an Ogg Vorbis file, ensuring that it exists and is actually an
       Ogg Vorbis stream, then loads the information and comment fields.  This
       method can also be used without a filename to load the information and
       fields of an already constructed instance.

INSTANCE METHODS
   "info ([$key])"
       Returns a hashref containing information about the Ogg Vorbis file from
       the file's information header.  Hash fields are: version, channels,
       rate, bitrate_upper, bitrate_nominal, bitrate_lower, bitrate_window,
       and length.  The bitrate_window value is not currently used by the
       vorbis codec, and will always be -1.

       The optional parameter, key, allows you to retrieve a single value from
       the object's hash.  Returns "undef" if the key is not found.

   "comment_tags ()"
       Returns an array containing the key values for the comment fields.
       These values can then be passed to "comment" to retrieve their values.

   "comment ($key)"
       Returns an array of comment values associated with the given key.

   "add_comments ($key, $value, [$key, $value, ...])"
       Unimplemented.

   "edit_comment ($key, $value, [$num])"
       Unimplemented.

   "delete_comment ($key, [$num])"
       Unimplemented.

   "clear_comments ([@keys])"
       Unimplemented.

   "write_vorbis ()"
       Unimplemented.

   "path ()"
       Returns the path/filename of the file the object represents.
