DESCRIPTION
       This module is an RDF/N3 parser; it can parse N3 files or strings and
       provide results in whatever format (as far as there are subclasses
       supporting your desired format available).

       RDF::Notation3 is a base class providing the parsing logic only. This
       class is never used directly. Instead, derived classes such as
       RDF::Notation3::Triples or Notation3::XML are used. The subclasses
       control how results of parsing are processed and can provide additional
       methods to access the results then.  RDF::Notation3 doesn't tend to
       create sophisticated in-memory or persistent RDF structures of its own;
       it should more likely serve as a parser for other Perl RDF modules
       (such as RDF::Core) focused on how to store and access RDF models.

METHODS COMMON TO ALL SUBCLASSES
       The following methods are common to all subclasses. The parse_file and
       parse_string methods may have somewhat different behavior for various
       subclasses, see also their description for particular classes for
       complete information.

       parse_file
            $rdf->parse_file($path);

           Parses an N3 file specified by $path. This method usually returns a
           number of parsed triples; however it can have different side-
           effects for different subclasses (e.g. storing triples in memory or
           converting to another format). See description of particular
           subclasses for details.

       parse_string
            $rdf->parse_file($string);

           Similar to parse_file, just parses N3 data from string.

       anonymous_ns_uri
            $ns_uri = $rdf->anonymous_ns_uri;
            $rdf->anonymous_ns_uri('http://gingerall.org/anonymous#');

           Gets or sets anonymous namespace URI. The default value is '#',
           which results in anonymous nodes URIs like this: <#g_1>. If set as
           above, it will be changed to <http://gingerall.org/anonymous#g_1>.

       quantification
            $status = $rdf->quantification;
            $rdf->quantification(0);

           Enables and disables existential quantification statements. Valid
           arguments are 0 (disable) and 1 (enable). When enabled (default),
           there are generated additional statements in form of

            current_context <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/log.n3#forSome> anonnode

           for anonymous nodes of type [...] and for contexts {...}. This is a
           common practice in Notation3 language, the way to turn this feature
           off is provided to be compatible with RDF/XML parsers.

SUBCLASSES
   RDF::Notation3::Triples
       This class parses an RDF/N3 file and stores triples in memory.
       Qualified names with prefixes are expanded using a prefix-URI mapping
       for given context during the parse time.

       methods:

       parse_file, parse_string
            $rdf->parse_file($path);
            $rdf->parse_string($string);

           Triples are stored to the $rdf->{triples} array. Namespace bindings
           appear in the $rdf->{ns} hash.

       get_triples
            $triples = $rdf->get_triples($subject, $property, $object, $context);

           Returns a reference to array of triples created by the parse
           method.  Arguments are optional. The result set can be filtered for
           particular subject, property, object or context. The array has the
           same structure as the $rdf->{triples} property.

           For example:

            $triples = $rdf->get_triples;

           returns all triples, while

            $triples = $rdf->get_triples($subject);

           returns only triples containing subject $subject and

            $triples = $rdf->get_triples(undef, $property, $object);

           returns only triples containing property $property and object
           $object.

            $triples = $rdf->get_triples(undef, undef, undef, '<>');

           returns all triples from the document (top-level) context.

       get_triples_as_string
            $triples = $rdf->get_triples_as_string($subject, $property, $object, $context);

           Returns triples in a line-based, plain text format called N-Triples
           (http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/ntriples/). Each line contains
           one triple in the form of "subject - predicate - object". The
           string can be filtered using subject, predicate, object, and
           context exactly in the same way as in the of case get_triples
           method.

       get_n3
            $n3 = $rdf->get_n3;

           This method serializes parsed triples back to an N3 string.
           Prefixes are not used at all.

       add_prefix
            $rc = $rdf->add_prefix('mop','my_own_prefix#');

           This method allows to add prefix-namespace bindings for the top-
           level context.  It returns the new number of bound prefixes.

       add_triple
            $rc = $rdf->add_triple('<#Bob>','foaf:name','"Bob"');

           This method allows to add triples one by one. It returns the new
           number of stored triples. A valid format of all arguments is
           checked as well as bindings of prefixes. QNames are expanded to
           URIs. Context is always set to top-level (document).

       properties:

       triples
            $rdf->{triples}

           A reference to array of triples created by the parse method. Each
           triple is represented as an array with 4 elements: subject,
           predicate, object, and context. All nodes are stored as <URI> or
           "literal". To filter triples use get_triples method.

       ns
            $rdf->{ns}

           A reference to hash created by the parse method. The hash keys are
           context URIs (<> for document context and <#c_n> for anonymous
           contexts). The hash values are again hashes keyed with prefixes
           with ns URIs as values.

   RDF::Notation3::PrefTriples
       This class parses an RDF/N3 file and stores triples in memory.
       Qualified names with prefixes are NOT expanded. The expansion can be
       done later using the {ns} hash. However, if a prefix-URI binding
       changes within a context, the result of parsing may be incorrect. Use
       this class as a faster way to get QNames with prefixes if you are SURE
       the binding doesn't change! Otherwise use RDF::Notation3::Triples for
       correct results.

       methods:

       parse_file, parse_string
            $rdf->parse_file($path);
            $rdf->parse_string($string);

           Triples are stored to the $rdf->{triples} array. Namespace bindings
           appear in the $rdf->{ns} hash.

       get_triples
           See RDF::Notation3::Triples.

       get_triples_as_string
           See RDF::Notation3::Triples.

       get_n3
            $n3 = $rdf->get_n3;

           This method serializes parsed triples back to an N3 string.
           Prefixes are preserved.

       add_prefix
           See RDF::Notation3::Triples.

       add_triple
           See RDF::Notation3::Triples. The only difference is that QNames are
           not expanded.

       properties:

       triples
            $rdf->{triples}

           A reference to array of triples created by the parse method. Each
           triple is represented as an array with 4 elements: subject,
           predicate, object, and context. All nodes are stored as <URI>,
           prefix:local or "literal". To filter triples use get_triples
           method.

       ns  See RDF::Notation3::Triples.

   RDF::Notation3::XML
       This class parses an RDF/N3 file and converts it to RDF/XML.

       methods:

       parse_file, parse_string
            $rdf->parse_file($path);
            $rdf->parse_string($string);

           Resulting XML is stored in the $rdf->{xml} array (line by line).

       get_string;
            $xml = $rdf->get_string;

           Returns resulting XML as string.

       get_array
            $xml = $rdf->get_array;

           Returns resulting XML as array.

       get_arrayref
            $xml = $rdf->get_arrayref;

           Returns resulting XML as reference to array.

   RDF::Notation3::SAX
       This class converts RDF/N3 files to RDF/XML streams of SAX events. It
       is an XML::SAX compliant SAX driver, therefore it requires XML::SAX to
       be installed. RDF::Notation3::SAX supports basic Handler
       (ContentHandler) and ErrorHandler. An example of a script (sax.pl)
       using the SAX driver and simple handlers (MyHandler.pm,
       MyErrorHandler.pm) can be found in the examples directory.

       See Perl SAX 2.0 Binding specification
       (http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/perl-xml/libxml-perl/doc/)
       and XML::SAX documentation to learn more about how to use SAX drivers
       and handlers.

       methods:

       parse_file, parse_string
            $rdf->parse_file($path);
            $rdf->parse_string($string);

           These methods don't return a number of parsed triples but result of
           calling the end_document() callback as required by SAX. The number
           of triples can be accessed as $rdf->{count}.

   RDF::Notation3::RDFCore
       This class parses an RDF/N3 file and returns an RDF::Core::Model
       object.  Using RDF::Core you can store parsed models either in memory
       or persistently, ask queries etc.

       methods:

       parse_file, parse_string
            $model = $rdf->parse_file($path);
            $model = $rdf->parse_string($string);

           Both methods return a model object.

       set_storage
            $rdf->set_storage($storage);

           Allows to select a storage for the model. The argument of this
           method must be one of the following objects:

           RDF::Core::Storage::Memory
               An in-memory implementation of RDF::Core::Storage

           RDF::Core::Storage::Postgres
               PostgreSQL implementation of RDF::Core::Storage

           RDF::Core::Storage::DB_File
               Berkeley DB 1.x implementation of RDF::Core::Storage

               An error is reported by parse_string and parse_file methods if
               there is no valid storage specified.

       get_n3
            $n3 = $rdf->get_n3($model);

           This method serializes an RDF::Core model to N3 string. Prefixes
           are used for predicates only so far.

   RDF::Notation3::RDFStore
       This class parses an RDF/N3 file and returns an RDFStore model object.
       The model is stored either in memory or persistently, according to
       passed options. See RDFStore docs for details.

       methods:

       parse_file, parse_string
            $model = $rdf->parse_file($path);
            $model = $rdf->parse_string($string);

           Both methods return a model object.

       set_options
            $rdf->set_options($options);

           Options are simply passed to the RDFStore::Model constructor. Thus
           all options supported by RDFStore can be used.
