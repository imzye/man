NAME
     nsnake – a snake game for your terminal

SYNOPSIS
     nsnake [-cnsw] [-C color]

DESCRIPTION
     You are controlling a snake where the goal is eating food spawning
     randomly on the screen.

     There are two types of food, normal and free, respectively +, *.

     The head of the snake is symbolized with an @.

     Each time you eat a piece of food, the snake will be grown by two. If you
     eat a free piece of food the score will be increased but not the snake's
     length.

     The following options are available:

               are enabled.

     -C color  Specify an alternate color between 0 and 8. (default 2)

     -n        Do not try to update score file.

     -s        Only display high score sorting by descending and exit.

     -w        Disable wall crossing. Can be used together with -s to show
               score with wall crossing disabled.

BUGS
     The snake seems to be faster when moving vertically, this is due to
     terminal character dimensions.
