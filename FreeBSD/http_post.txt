http_post(1)            FreeBSD General Commands Manual           http_post(1)

NAME
       http_post - do a POST to an HTTP URL

SYNOPSIS
       http_post [-t timeout] [-r referrer] [-u user-agent] [-a
       username:password] [-c cookie] [-h header value ] [-v] url [-f]
       name=value ...

DESCRIPTION
       http_post Http_post does a POST operation to an HTTP URL and dumps the
       results to stdout.  It does not do gopher, ftp, file, news, or any
       other type of URL, only HTTP.  It can be configured to do HTTPS POSTs
       as well.

       The -t flag specifies a timeout in seconds.  If that much time passes
       with no activity, the post is aborted.  The default is 60 seconds.

       The -r flag specifies a referrer header to send.  Some tightly-clenched
       web admins like to jigger their server to only return files if the
       proper referrer is given.

       The -u flag specifies a User-Agent header to send.  Some *really*
       tightly-clenched web admins like to jigger their server to only return
       files if a well-known User-Agent is given.

       The -a flag lets you do Basic Authentication.

       The -c flag lets you pass in a cookie.

       The -h flag lets you pass in one extra header.

       The -v flag is for debugging; it writes out the response headers, as
       well as the response contents.

       The -f flag can be used before each name=value pair.  It tells
       http_post that the value is actually a filename to be read and inserted
       into the request.  It also switches the entire request to use a
       content-type of multipart/form-data, instead of the usual
       application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
