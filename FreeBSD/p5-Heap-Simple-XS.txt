NAME
       Heap::Simple::XS - An XS implementation of the Heap::Simple interface

SYNOPSIS
           # Let Heap::Simple decide which implementation that provides its interface
           # it will load and use. This may be Heap::Simple::XS or it may not be.
           # Still, this is the normal way of using Heap::Simple
           use Heap::Simple;
           my $heap = Heap::Simple->new(...);
           # Use heap as described in the Heap::Simple documentation

           # If for some reason you insist on using this version:
           use Heap::Simple::XS;
           my $heap = Heap::Simple::XS->new(...);
           # Use the XS heap as described in the Heap::Simple documentation

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides an XS implementation of the interface described in
       Heap::Simple. Look there for a description.

NOTES
       •   Even though this implementation is written in C, it fully supports
           overloading and magic (like ties).

       •   The dirty option will do several things.

           •   It will cause scalars for the "<" and ">" orders to be stored
               internally as an NV (double or long double). This means you
               lose magic, overload and any internal integer representation.

           •   The "<" and ">" order will cause "Array" and "Hash" elements to
               get their key internally cached as an NV. So indirect changes
               to the value won't be noticed anymore (but most of the time you
               shouldn't do that anyways).  It also means these will start
               behaving like a wrapped heap type, so they return true for
               wrapped and support key_insert and key_absorb.

           •   The "<" and ">" order will cause "Object" and "Any" elements to
               store the key as an NV (these two already were wrapped heap
               types).

           •   It has no effect on "Method" and "Function" element types since
               it's assumed you want the key recalculations for these for some
               reason (if you didn't, you would have asked for "Object" or
               "Any" elements).

       •   Heap::Simple->implementation will return "Heap::Simple::XS" if it
           selected this module.

EXPORT
       None.
