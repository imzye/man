HEXWORDS(1)                     mpatrol library                    HEXWORDS(1)

NAME
       hexwords - extracts any words from a file that can be written as hex
       numbers

SYNOPSIS
       hexwords [options] [dictfile]

DESCRIPTION
       The hexwords command is a little tool that can be used to generate
       hexadecimal constants from a dictionary of known words.  Such numerical
       constants can be used in source files for a variety of debugging
       problems, and problems with uninitialised variables are especially
       relevant since these special numbers will stand out if seen from within
       a debugger.  For example, here are some common (and some not-so-common)
       32-bit hexadecimal constants that can be used as debugging aids:


           word   hex constant
       addedbad   0xaddedbad
       allocate   0xa110ca7e
       badlabel   0xbad1abe1
       baseball   0xba5eba11
       codebabe   0xc0debabe
       codedbad   0xc0dedbad
       deadbeef   0xdeadbeef
       deadcode   0xdeadc0de
       failsafe   0xfa115afe
       feedface   0xfeedface
       freedata   0xf4eeda7a
       goodcode   0x600dc0de

       As can be seen above, many decimal digits can be used to represent the
       letters that they most closely resemble, along with the hexadecimal
       digits A through F.  This provides a much larger selection of words
       that can be matched, although the digits 3 and 8 cannot be used due to
       the lack of any similar-looking letters.  The digits and their
       corresponding letters are given in the following table.


       digit   letter
       0       O, o or Q
       1       I, i or l
       2       Z or z
       3       -
       4       q or R
       5       S or s
       6       G
       7       J or T
       8       -
       9       g
       A-F     A-F
       a-f     a-f

       The dictfile argument must be a valid dictionary filename but if
       dictfile is omitted then hexwords will use /usr/dict/words as the name
       of the dictionary file to use.  If that cannot be found then hexwords
       will try /usr/lib/dict/words and /usr/share/dict/words.  The dictionary
       file must be a plain text file that contains one word per line,
       otherwise few to no words will be matched.

       The hexwords command currently makes use of several UNIX text
       processing commands in order to extract the words and their hexadecimal
       equivalents.  As a result, the hexwords command is only likely to work
       on UNIX platforms or on systems which have the necessary commands
       installed.

OPTIONS
       --help [-h]
              Displays a quick-reference option summary.

       --match <exact|lower|upper|any> [-m]
              Sets the type of case-sensitivity to use.  A setting of exact
              performs a case-sensitive comparison of all of the words in the
              dictionary file and the hexadecimal digits, whereas a setting of
              any does not.  The lower and upper settings convert the words in
              the dictionary file to lower and upper case respectively before
              performing a case-sensitive comparison.  The default case-
              sensitivity is exact.

       --maximum <count> [-u]
              Sets the maximum number of letters to match.  None of the
              hexadecimal numbers displayed will have any more digits than
              this.  The default is 8.

       --minimum <count> [-l]
              Sets the minimum number of letters to match.  None of the
              hexadecimal numbers displayed will have any less digits than
              this.  The default is 4.

       --version [-V]
              Displays the version number of the hexwords command.
