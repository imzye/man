NAME
       tags - tagged files used for clustering extensions

DESCRIPTION
       Tagged files are used by ClusterNFS and unfs3 to support NFS exporting
       directories like /etc and /var to a cluster of client machines. The
       problem at hand is that different files need to be served to different
       clients. Tagged files provide a way to specify which file should be
       served to which client(s).

       Tags are appended to the end of a filename and are seperated from the
       rest of the name by beginning and ending with $$. For each file, there
       can be multiple tagged variants. The normal file, without a tag, is
       only served to clients by default when no tagged file matching the
       client is found. The following tags exist:

       file$$$$
              If a client attempts to access this file, it will be redirected
              to the normal file instead, no matter what other tagged files
              exist. This is mainly useful for use inside symlinks that need
              to point to a normal file although other access to the normal
              file should be redirected. In this special case, the tagged file
              file$$$$ does not even need to exist (the symlink will then seem
              to be dangling on the server).

       file$$IP=a.b.c.d$$
              If a client with an IP address of a.b.c.d attempts to access the
              normal file, it will be redirected to this file instead.

       file$$IP=a.b.c.d_n$$
              If a client with an IP adress in the network a.b.c.d/n attempts
              to access the normal file, it will be redirected to this file
              instead. Note that unfs3 only supports 8, 16, and 24 as values
              for n.

       file$$HOST=name$$
              If a client with the hostname name attempts to access the normal
              file, it will be redirected to this file instead.

       file$$HOST=name*$$
              If a client whose hostname begins with the string name attempts
              to access the normal file, it will be redirected to this file
              instead.

       file$$CLIENT$$
              If any client attempts to access the normal file, it will be
              redirected to this file instead.

       file$$ALWAYS=IP$$
              If any client attempts to access or create the normal file, it
              will be redirected to file$$IP=a.b.c.d$$ instead, where a.b.c.d
              is the IP address of the client. It does not matter whether the
              target tagged file exists or not.

       file$$ALWAYS=CLIENT$$
              If any client attempts to access or create the normal file, it
              will be redirected to file$$CLIENT$$ instead. It does not matter
              whether that file exists or not.

       $$ALWAYS=CLIENT$$
              Like above, but effective for all files in the directory where
              it is found.

       $$ALWAYS=IP$$
              Like above, but effective for all files in the directory where
              it is found.

       Note that the ALWAYS tag can lead to file not found errors on clients
       if the tagged files it redirects to does not exist on the server. For
       example, ls(1) can suffer from this problem. Furthermore, this tag is a
       unfs3 extension and does not exist in ClusterNFS.  When this tags
       exists, it prevents all access to the normal file by any client.

       file$$CREATE=IP$$
              If any client attempts to create the normal file,
              file$$IP=a.b.c.d$$ will be created instead, where a.b.c.d is the
              IP address of the client.

       file$$CREATE=CLIENT$$
              If any client attempts to create the normal file, file$$CLIENT$$
              will be created instead.

       $$CREATE=IP$$
              Like above, but effective for all files in the directory where
              it is found.

       $$CREATE=CLIENT$$
              Like above, but effective for all files in the directory where
              it is found.

       Tags work for all kinds of named filesystem objects.  If multiple
       tagged files are found for a normal file, they are considered in the
       order they are given above, starting at the top. Processing stops once
       a match is found.  In ClusterNFS, but not in unfs3, only files
       accessible and readable by a client are considered matches.
