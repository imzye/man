NAME
     gss_inquire_cred – Obtain information about a credential

SYNOPSIS
     #include <gssapi/gssapi.h>

     OM_uint32
     gss_inquire_cred(OM_uint32 *minor_status,
         const gss_cred_id_t cred_handle, gss_ctx_id_t *context_handle,
         gss_name_t *name, OM_uint32 *lifetime, gss_cred_usage_t *cred_usage,
         gss_OID_set *mechanisms);

DESCRIPTION
     Obtains information about a credential.

PARAMETERS
     minor_status      Mechanism specific status code.

     cred_handle       A handle that refers to the target credential.  Specify
                       GSS_C_NO_CREDENTIAL to inquire about the default
                       initiator principal.

     name              The name whose identity the credential asserts.
                       Storage associated with this name should be freed by
                       the application after use with a call to
                       gss_release_name().  Specify NULL if not required.

     lifetime          The number of seconds for which the credential will
                       remain valid.  If the credential has expired, this
                       parameter will be set to zero.  If the implementation
                       does not support credential expiration, the value
                       GSS_C_INDEFINITE will be returned.  Specify NULL if not
                       required.

     cred_usage        How the credential may be used.  One of the following:
                             GSS_C_INITIATE
                             GSS_C_ACCEPT
                             GSS_C_BOTH
                       Specify NULL if not required.

     mechanisms        Set of mechanisms supported by the credential.  Storage
                       associated with this OID set must be freed by the
                       application after use with a call to
                       gss_release_oid_set().  Specify NULL if not required.

RETURN VALUES
     GSS_S_COMPLETE                  Successful completion

     GSS_S_NO_CRED                   The referenced credentials could not be
                                     accessed

     GSS_S_DEFECTIVE_CREDENTIAL      The referenced credentials were invalid

     GSS_S_CREDENTIALS_EXPIRED       The referenced credentials have expired.
                                     If the lifetime parameter was not passed
                                     as NULL, it will be set to 0
