NAME
       urlwatch - Monitor webpages and command output for changes

SYNOPSIS
       urlwatch [options] [JOB ...]

DESCRIPTION
       urlwatch is intended to help you watch changes in webpages and get
       notified (via e-mail, in your terminal or through various third party
       services) of any changes. The change notification will include the URL
       that has changed and a unified diff of what has changed.

       See urlwatch-intro(7) for a quick start guide and tutorial, and
       urlwatch-cookbook(7) for usage recipes and tricks.

       This manpage describes the CLI tool.

                     according to the --list command.
