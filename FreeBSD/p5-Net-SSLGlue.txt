NAME
       Net::SSLGlue - add/extend SSL support for common perl modules

DESCRIPTION
       Some commonly used perl modules don't have SSL support at all, even if
       the protocol supports it. Others have SSL support, but most of them
       don't do proper checking of the server's certificate.

       The "Net::SSLGlue::*" modules try to add SSL support or proper
       certificate checking to these modules. Currently support for the
       following modules is available:

       Net::SMTP - add SSL from beginning or using STARTTLS
       Net::POP3 - add SSL from beginning or using STLS
       Net::FTP  - add SSL and IPv6 support to Net::FTP
       Net::LDAP - add proper certificate checking
       LWP - add proper certificate checking for older LWP versions

       There is also a Net::SSLGlue::Socket package which combines ssl and
       non-ssl and ipv6 capabilities to make it easier to enhance modules
       based on IO::Socket::INET.
