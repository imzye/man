DESCRIPTION
       This is a fake resource that details the options that can be configured
       for the CRM Daemon.

SUPPORTED PARAMETERS
       dc-version = string [none]
           Version of Pacemaker on the cluster's DC.

           Includes the hash which identifies the exact changeset it was built
           from. Used for diagnostic purposes.

       cluster-infrastructure = string [heartbeat]
           The messaging stack on which Pacemaker is currently running.

           Used for informational and diagnostic purposes.

       cluster-name = string [(null)]
           An arbitrary name for the cluster

           This optional value is mostly for users' convenience as desired in
           administration, but may also be used in Pacemaker configuration
           rules via the #cluster-name node attribute, and by higher-level
           tools and resource agents.

       dc-deadtime = time [20s]
           How long to wait for a response from other nodes during startup.

           The "correct" value will depend on the speed/load of your network
           and the type of switches used.

       cluster-recheck-interval = time [15min]
           Polling interval for time based changes to options, resource
           parameters and constraints.

           The Cluster is primarily event driven, however the configuration
           can have elements that change based on time. To ensure these
           changes take effect, we can optionally poll the cluster's status
           for changes. Allowed values: Zero disables polling. Positive values
           are an interval in seconds (unless other SI units are specified.
           eg. 5min)

       load-threshold = percentage [80%]
           The maximum amount of system resources that should be used by nodes
           in the cluster

           The cluster will slow down its recovery process when the amount of
           system resources used (currently CPU) approaches this limit

       node-action-limit = integer [0]
           The maximum number of jobs that can be scheduled per node. Defaults
           to 2x cores

       fence-reaction = string [stop]
           How a cluster node should react if notified of its own fencing

           A cluster node may receive notification of its own fencing if
           fencing is misconfigured, or if fabric fencing is in use that
           doesn't cut cluster communication. Allowed values are "stop" to
           attempt to immediately stop pacemaker and stay stopped, or "panic"
           to attempt to immediately reboot the local node, falling back to
           stop on failure.

       election-timeout = time [2min]
           *** Advanced Use Only ***.

           If need to adjust this value, it probably indicates the presence of
           a bug.

       shutdown-escalation = time [20min]
           *** Advanced Use Only ***.

           If need to adjust this value, it probably indicates the presence of
           a bug.

       crmd-integration-timeout = time [3min]
           *** Advanced Use Only ***.

           If need to adjust this value, it probably indicates the presence of
           a bug.

       crmd-finalization-timeout = time [30min]
           *** Advanced Use Only ***.

           If you need to adjust this value, it probably indicates the
           presence of a bug.

       crmd-transition-delay = time [0s]
           *** Advanced Use Only *** Enabling this option will slow down
           cluster recovery under all conditions

           Delay cluster recovery for the configured interval to allow for
           additional/related events to occur. Useful if your configuration is
           sensitive to the order in which ping updates arrive.

       stonith-watchdog-timeout = time [(null)]
           How long to wait before we can assume nodes are safely down

       stonith-max-attempts = integer [10]
           How many times stonith can fail before it will no longer be
           attempted on a target
