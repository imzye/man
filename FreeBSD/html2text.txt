NAME
       html2text - an advanced HTML-to-text converter

SYNOPSIS
       html2text -help
       html2text -version
       html2text [ -check ] [ -debug-scanner ] [ -debug-parser ] [ -rcfile
       path ] [ -width width ] [ -o output-file ] [ -nobs ] [ -from_encoding
       encoding ] [ -to_encoding encoding ] [ -ascii ] [ -utf8 ] [ input-file
       ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       html2text reads HTML documents from the input-files, formats each of
       them into a stream of UTF-8 encoded characters, and writes the result
       to standard output (or into output-file, if the -o command line option
       is used).

       If no input-files are specified on the command line, html2text reads
       from standard input. A dash as the input-file is an alternate way to
       specify standard input.

       html2text understands all HTML 3.2 constructs, but can render only part
       of them due to the limitations of the text output format. However, the
       program attempts to provide good substitutes for the elements it cannot
       render.  html2text parses HTML 4 input, too, but not always as
       successful as other HTML processors. It also accepts syntactically
       incorrect input, and attempts to interpret it "reasonably".

       The way html2text formats the HTML documents is controlled by
       formatting properties read from an RC file.  html2text attempts to read
       $HOME/.html2textrc (or the file specified by the -rcfile command line
       option); if that file cannot be read, html2text attempts to read
       /etc/html2textrc.  If no RC file can be read (or if the RC file does
       not override all formatting properties), then "reasonable" defaults are
       assumed. The RC file format is described in the html2textrc(5) manual
       page.

OPTIONS
       -ascii By default, html2text uses UTF-8 for its output. Specifying this
              option, plain ASCII is used instead. Non-ASCII characters are
              rendered via iconv's transliteration feature.  As such this
              option is an alias for -to_encoding ASCII//TRANSLIT.

       -utf8  Assume both terminal and input stream are in UTF-8 mode. This is
              an alias for -from_encoding UTF-8 -to_encoding UTF-8.

       -from_encoding encoding
              Sets the encoding of the input file or stream to the given
              encoding.  By default, html2text tries to obtain the encoding
              from the input file and uses ISO-8859-1 encoding as fallback.
              You might want to override the detection or fallback using this
              option.  See iconv -l for a list of supported encodings.

       -to_encoding encoding
              Use the given encoding while writing output, instead of UTF-8.
              The same set of encodings as for the -from_encoding option can
              be used.

       -check This option is for diagnostic purposes: The HTML document is
              only parsed and not processed otherwise. In this mode of
              operation, html2text will report on parse errors and scan
              errors, which it does not in other modes of operation. Note that
              parse and scan errors are not fatal for html2text, but may cause
              mis-interpretation of the HTML code and/or portions of the
              document being swallowed.

       -debug-parser
              Let html2text report on the tokens being shifted, rules being
              applied, etc., while scanning the HTML document. This option is
              for diagnostic purposes.

       -debug-scanner
              Let html2text report on each lexical token scanned, while
              scanning the HTML document. This option is for diagnostic
              purposes.

       -help  Print command line summary and exit.

       -nobs  By default, html2text renders underlined letters with sequences
              like "underscore-backspace-character" and boldface letters like
              "character-backspace-character", which works fine when the
              output is piped into more(1), less(1), or similar. For other
              applications, or when redirecting the output into a file, it may
              be desirable not to render character attributes with such
              backspace sequences, which can be accomplished with this command
              line option.

       -o output-file
              Write the output to output-file instead of standard output. A
              dash as the output-file is an alternate way to specify the
              standard output.

       -rcfile path
              Attempt to read the file specified in path as RC file.

       -links Tags all external links with a number between brackets ([num]),
              and produces a numbered list at the end of the document with all
              link targets.

       -version
              Print program version and exit.

       -width width
              By default, html2text formats the HTML documents for a screen
              width of 79 characters. If redirecting the output into a file,
              or if your terminal has a width other than 80 characters, or if
              you just want to get an idea how html2text deals with large
              tables and different terminal widths, you may want to specify a
              different width.

FILES
       /etc/html2textrc
              System wide parser configuration file.

       $HOME/.html2textrc
              Personal parser configuration file, overrides the system wide
              values.

CONFORMING TO
       HTML 3.2 (HTML 3.2 Reference Specification - http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-
       html32).

RESTRICTIONS
       html2text was written to convert HTML 3.2 documents. When using it with
       HTML 4 or even XHTML 1 documents, some constructs present only in these
       HTML versions might not be rendered.
