NAME
       Data::Uniqid - Perl extension for simple genrating of unique id's

SYNOPSIS
         use Data::Uniqid qw ( suniqid uniqid luniqid );

         $id = suniqid;
         $id = uniqid;
         $id = luniqid;

DESCRIPTION
       Data::Uniqid provides three simple routines for generating unique ids.
       These ids are coded with a Base62 systen to make them short and handy
       (e.g. to use it as part of a URL).

         suinqid
           genrates a very short id valid only for the localhost and with a
           liftime of 1 day

         uniqid
           generates a short id valid on the local host

         luniqid
           generates a long id valid everywhere and ever
