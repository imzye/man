G15Daemon(1)                           1                          G15Daemon(1)

NAME
       g15daemon - provides access to extra keys and the LCD available on the
       logitech G15 keyboard.

DESCRIPTION
       G15Daemon allows users access to all extra keys by decoding them and
       pushing them back into the kernel via the linux UINPUT driver.  This
       driver must be loaded before g15daemon can be used for keyboard access.

       The G15 LCD is also supported.  By default, with no other clients
       active, g15daemon will display a clock.  Client applications and
       scripts can access the LCD via a simple API.

OPTIONS
       The current version of G15Daemon understands the following options:

       -v     Show version info.

       -s    By default, g15daemon uses the L1 key to switch between client
              screens.  Using this switch on the cmdline alters this, making
              MR (Macro Record) the button to achieve this function.

       -k     Stop a previously running copy of G15Daemon.  For the keys and
              LCD to work, you'll have to restart the daemon manually.

       -h     Show a brief summary of commandline options available.


BASIC USAGE
       G15Daemon must be run as the root user, either from a startup script
       (sample scripts are available in the contrib folder) or manually, via
       the su command.

       To run the daemon with default options, run:

            g15daemon

       or

            g15daemon -s to have the MR key as the client screen switch.

       If all required libraries are installed and in locations known to your
       operating system, the daemon will slip quietly into the background and
       a clock will appear on the LCD.  Congratulations!  The linux kernel
       will now output keycodes for all your extra keys.


Using the keys in X11
       Current versions of the Xorg Xserver dont have support for the extra
       keys that g15daemon provides.  This support will be available in the
       next release of Xorg (7.2).

       For now, if you want access to the extra keys for hotkey support in
       X11, you need to run the xmodmaprc script on each start of X.  This
       script is available in the contrib folder (if g15daemon is installed in
       the default location, the contrib folder is in
       /usr/share/doc/g15daemon-${VERSION}/contrib

       Depending on your linux distribution, copying the xmodmaprc file (or
       pasting the text below) into ~/.Xmodmap may be all that's required.


Xmodmaprc file
       Copy the following into ~/.Xmodmap (depending on your distribution) for
       X11 to recognise all extra G15 keys:
