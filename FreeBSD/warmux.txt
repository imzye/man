NAME
       Warmux - A convivial mass murder game.

SYNOPSIS
       warmux [-h|--help] [-v|--version] [-p|--play] [-i|--internet]
       [-s|--server] [-c|--client [ip]] [-d|--debug debug_masks]

DESCRIPTION
       Have the mascots of your favorite free software battle in the Warmux
       arena using dynamite, grenades, baseball bat and other weapons ...
       Exterminate your opponent in a funny 2D toon-style scenery.

       Each player (2 minimum, on the same PC) controls the team of his choice
       (tux, gnu, firefox, wilber,...) and must destroy his adversaries using
       more or less casual weapons.

       Although a minimum of strategy is required to be victorious, Warmux is
       pre-eminently a "convivial mass murder" game where, turn by turn, each
       team attempts to produce maximum damage to their opponents.
