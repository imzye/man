NAME
       Imager::Graph - Perl extension for producing Graphs using the Imager
       library.

SYNOPSIS
         use Imager::Graph::Sub_class;
         my $chart = Imager::Graph::Sub_class->new;
         my $img = $chart->draw(data=> \@data, ...)
           or die $chart->error;
         $img->write(file => 'image.png');

DESCRIPTION
       Imager::Graph provides style information to its base classes.  It
       defines the colors, text display information and fills based on both
       built-in styles and modifications supplied by the user to the draw()
       method.

       new This is a simple constructor.  No parameters required.

       set_graph_size($size)
           Sets the size of the graph (in pixels) within the image.  The size
           of the image defaults to 1.5 * $graph_size.

       set_image_width($width)
           Sets the width of the image in pixels.

       set_image_height($height)
           Sets the height of the image in pixels.

       add_data_series([8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9], 'Series Name');
           Adds a data series to the graph.  For Imager::Graph::Pie, only one
           data series can be added.

       set_labels(['label1', 'label2' ... ])
           Labels the specific data points.  For line/bar graphs, this is the
           x-axis.  For pie graphs, it is the label for the wedges.

       set_title($title)
           Sets the title of the graph.  Requires setting a font.

       set_font($font)
           Sets the font to use for text.  Takes an Imager::Font object.

       set_style($style_name)
           Sets the style to be used for the graph.  Imager::Graph comes with
           several pre-defined styles: fount_lin (default), fount_rad, mono,
           primary_red, and primary.

       error
           Returns an error message.  Only valid if the draw() method returns
           false.

       draw
           Creates a new image, draws the chart onto that image and returns
           it.

           Optionally, instead of using the api methods to configure your
           chart, you can supply a "data" parameter in the format required by
           that particular graph, and if your graph will use any text, a
           "font" parameter

           You can also supply many different parameters which control the way
           the graph looks.  These are supplied as keyword, value pairs, where
           the value can be a hashref containing sub values.

           The "style" parameter will selects a basic color set, and possibly
           sets other related parameters.  See "STYLES".

            my $font = Imager::Font->new(file => 'ImUgly.ttf');
            my $img = $chart->draw(
                            data    => \@data,
                            font    => $font,
                            title   => {
                                            text  => "Hello, World!",
                                            size  => 36,
                                            color => 'FF0000'
                                       }
                            );

           When referring to a single sub-value this documentation will refer
           to 'title.color' rather than 'the color element of title'.

           Returns the graph image on success, or false on failure.

STYLES
       The currently defined styles are:

       primary
           a light grey background with no outlines.  Uses primary colors for
           the data fills.

       primary_red
           a light red background with no outlines.  Uses primary colors for
           the data fills.

           Graphs drawn using this style should save well as a gif, even
           though some graphs may perform a slight blur.

           This was the default style, but the red was too loud.

       mono
           designed for monochrome output, such as most laser printers, this
           uses hatched fills for the data, and no colors.  The returned image
           is a one channel image (which can be overridden with the "channels"
           parameter.)

           You can also override the colors used by all components for
           background or drawing by supplying "fg" and/or "bg" parameters.
           ie.  if you supply "<fg="'FF0000', channels=>3>> then the hash
           fills and anything else will be drawn in red.  Another use might be
           to set a transparent background, by supplying "<bg="'00000000',
           channels=>4>>.

           This style outlines the legend if present and outlines the hashed
           fills.

       fount_lin
           designed as a "pretty" style this uses linear fountain fills for
           the background and data fills, and adds a drop shadow.

           You can override the value used for text and outlines by setting
           the "fg" parameter.

           This is the default style.

       fount_rad
           also designed as a "pretty" style this uses radial fountain fills
           for the data and a linear blue to green fill for the background.

FEATURES
       Each graph type has a number of features.  These are used to add
       various items that are displayed in the graph area.

       Features can be controlled by calling methods on the graph object, or
       by passing a "features" parameter to draw().

       Some common features are:

       show_legend()
           Feature: legend <features, legend>

           adds a box containing boxes filled with the data fills, with the
           labels provided to the draw method.  The legend will only be
           displayed if both the legend feature is enabled and labels are
           supplied.

       show_outline()
           Feature: outline

           If enabled, draw a border around the elements representing data in
           the graph, eg. around each pie segments on a pie chart, around each
           bar on a bar chart.

       show_labels()
           Feature: labels

           labels each data fill, usually by including text inside the data
           fill.  If the text does not fit in the fill, they could be
           displayed in some other form, eg. as callouts in a pie graph.

           For pie charts there isn't much point in enabling both the "legend"
           and "labels" features.

           For other charts, the labels label the independent variable, while
           the legend describes the color used to plot the dependent
           variables.

       show_drop_shadow()
           Feature: dropshadow

           a simple drop shadow is shown behind some of the graph elements.

       reset_features()
           Unsets all of the features.

           Note: this disables all features, even those enabled by default for
           a style.  They can then be enabled by calling feature methods or by
           supplying a "feature" parameter to the draw() method.

       Additionally, features can be set by passing them into the draw()
       method, named as above:

       •   if supplied as an array reference, then any element "no"featurename
           will disable that feature, while an element featurename will enable
           it.

       •   if supplied as a scalar, it is treated as if it were a reference to
           an array containing only that scalar.

       •   if supplied as a hash reference, then a "reset" key with a true
           value will avoid inheriting any default features, a key feature
           with a false value will disable that feature and a key feature with
           a true value will enable that feature.

       Each graph also has features specific to that graph.

COMMON PARAMETERS
       When referring to a single sub-value this documentation will refer to
       'title.color' rather than 'the color element of title'.

       Normally, except for the font parameter, these are controlled by
       styles, but these are the style parameters I'd mostly likely expect you
       want to use:

       font
           the Imager font object used to draw text on the chart.

       back
           the background fill for the graph.  Default depends on the style.

       size
           the base size of the graph image.  Default: 256

       width
           the width of the graph image.  Default: 1.5 * size (384)

       height
           the height of the graph image.  Default: size (256)

       channels
           the number of channels in the image.  Default: 3 (the 'mono' style
           sets this to 1).

       line
           the color used for drawing lines, such as outlines or callouts.
           Default depends on the current style.  Set to undef to remove the
           outline from a style.

       title
           the text used for a graph title.  Default: no title.  Note: this is
           the same as the title=>{ text => ... } field.

           halign
               horizontal alignment of the title in the graph, one of 'left',
               'center' or 'right'. Default: center

           valign
               vertical alignment of the title, one of 'top', 'center' or
               'right'.  Default: top.  It's probably a bad idea to set this
               to 'center' unless you have a very short title.

       text
           This contains basic defaults used in drawing text.

           color
               the default color used for all text, defaults to the fg color.

           size
               the base size used for text, also used to scale many graph
               elements.  Default: 14.

BEYOND STYLES
       In most cases you will want to use just the styles, but you may want to
       exert more control over the way your chart looks.  This section
       describes the options you can use to control the way your chart looks.

       Hopefully you don't need to read this.

       back
           The background of the graph.

       bg
       fg  Used to define basic background and foreground colors for the
           graph.  The bg color may be used for the background of the graph,
           and is used as a default for the background of hatched fills.  The
           fg is used as the default for line and text colors.

       font
           The default font used by the graph.  Normally you should supply
           this if your graph as any text.

       line
           The default line color.

       text
           defaults for drawing text.  Other textual graph elements will
           inherit or modify these values.

           color
               default text color, defaults to the fg color.

           size
               default text size. Default: 14.  This is used to scale many
               graph elements, including padding and leader sizes.  Other text
               elements will either use or scale this value.

           font
               default font object.  Inherited from font, which should have
               been supplied by the caller.

       title
           If you supply a scalar value for this element, it will be stored in
           the text field.

           Defines the text, font and layout information for the title.

           color
               The color of the title, inherited from text.color.

           font
               The font object used for the title, inherited from text.font.

           size
               size of the title text. Default: double text.size

           halign
           valign
               The horizontal and vertical alignment of the title.

       legend
           defines attributes of the graph legend, if present.

           color
           font
           size
               text attributes for the labels used in the legend.

           patchsize
               the width and height of the color patch in the legend.
               Defaults to 90% of the legend text size.

           patchgap
               the minimum gap between patches in pixels.  Defaults to 30% of
               the patchsize.

           patchborder
               the color of the border drawn around each patch.  Inherited
               from line.

           halign
           valign
               the horizontal and vertical alignment of the legend within the
               graph.  Defaults to 'right' and 'top'.

           padding
               the gap between the legend patches and text and the outside of
               its box, or to the legend border, if any.

           outsidepadding
               the gap between the border and the outside of the legend's box.
               This is only used if the legend.border attribute is defined.

           fill
               the background fill for the legend.  Default: none

           border
               the border color of the legend.  Default: none (no border is
               drawn around the legend.)

           orientation
               The orientation of the legend.  If this is "vertical" the the
               patches and labels are stacked on top of each other.  If this
               is "horizontal" the patchs and labels are word wrapped across
               the image.  Default: vertical.

           For example to create a horizontal legend with borderless patches,
           darker than the background, you might do:

             my $im = $chart->draw
               (...,
               legend =>
               {
                 patchborder => undef,
                 orientation => 'horizontal',
                 fill => { solid => Imager::Color->new(0, 0, 0, 32), }
               },
               ...);

       callout
           defines attributes for graph callouts, if any are present.  eg. if
           the pie graph cannot fit the label into the pie graph segement it
           will present it as a callout.

           color
           font
           size
               the text attributes of the callout label.  Inherited from text.

           line
               the color of the callout lines.  Inherited from line

           inside
           outside
               the length of the leader on the inside and the outside of the
               fill, usually at some angle.  Both default to the size of the
               callout text.

           leadlen
               the length of the horizontal portion of the leader.  Default:
               callout.size.

           gap the gap between the callout leader and the callout text.
               Defaults to 30% of the text callout size.

       label
           defines attributes for labels drawn into the data areas of a graph.

           color
           font
           size
               The text attributes of the labels.  Inherited from text.

       dropshadow
           the attributes of the graph's drop shadow

           fill
               the fill used for the drop shadow.  Default: '404040' (dark
               gray)

           off the offset of the drop shadow.  A convenience value inherited
               by offx and offy.  Default: 40% of text.size.

           offx
           offy
               the horizontal and vertical offsets of the drop shadow.  Both
               inherited from dropshadow.off.

           filter
               the filter description passed to Imager's filter method to blur
               the drop shadow.  Default: an 11 element convolution filter.

       outline
           describes the lines drawn around filled data areas, such as the
           segments of a pie chart.

           line
               the line color of the outlines, inherited from line.

       fills
           a reference to an array containing fills for each data item.

           You can mix fill types, ie. using a simple color for the first
           item, a hatched fill for the second and a fountain fill for the
           next.

HOW VALUES WORK
       Internally rather than specifying literal color, fill, or font objects
       or literal sizes for each element, Imager::Graph uses a number of
       special values to inherit or modify values taken from other graph
       element names.

   Specifying colors
       You can specify colors by either supplying an Imager::Color object, by
       supplying lookup of another color, or by supplying a single value that
       Imager::Color::new can use as an initializer.  The most obvious is just
       a 6 or 8 digit hex value representing the red, green, blue and
       optionally alpha channels of the image.

       You can lookup another color by using the lookup() "function", for
       example if you give a color as "lookup(fg)" then Imager::Graph will
       look for the fg element in the current style (or as overridden by you.)
       This is used internally by Imager::Graph to set up the relationships
       between the colors of various elements, for example the default style
       information contains:

          text=>{
                 color=>'lookup(fg)',
                 ...
                },
          legend =>{
                    color=>'lookup(text.color)',
                    ...
                   },

       So by setting the fg color, you also set the default text color, since
       each text element uses lookup(text.color) as its value.

   Specifying fills
       Fills can be used for the graph background color, the background color
       for the legend block and for the fills used for each data element.

       You can specify a fill as a color value or as a general fill, see
       Imager::Fill for details.

       You don't need (or usually want) to call Imager::Fill::new yourself,
       since the various fill functions will call it for you, and
       Imager::Graph provides some hooks to make them more useful.

       •   with hatched fills, if you don't supply a 'fg' or 'bg' parameter,
           Imager::Graph will supply the current graph fg and bg colors.

       •   with fountain fill, you can supply the xa_ratio, ya_ratio, xb_ratio
           and yb_ratio parameters, and they will be scaled in the fill area
           to define the fountain fills xa, ya, xb and yb parameters.

       As with colors, you can use lookup(name) or lookup(name1.name2) to have
       one element to inherit the fill of another.

       Imager::Graph defaults the fill combine value to 'normal'.  This
       doesn't apply to simple color fills.

   Specifying numbers
       You can specify various numbers, usually representing the size of
       something, commonly text, but sometimes the length of a line or the
       size of a gap.

       You can use the same lookup mechanism as with colors and fills, but you
       can also scale values.  For example, 'scale(0.5,text.size)' will return
       half the size of the normal text size.

       As with colors, this is used internally to scale graph elements based
       on the base text size.  If you change the base text size then other
       graph elements will scale as well.

   Specifying other elements
       Other elements, such as fonts, or parameters for a filter, can also use
       the lookup(name) mechanism.

INTERNAL METHODS
       Only useful if you need to fix bugs, add features or create a new graph
       class.

       _error($message)
           Sets the error field of the object and returns an empty list or
           undef, depending on context.  Should be used for error handling,
           since it may provide some user hooks at some point.

           The intended usage is:

             some action
               or return $self->_error("error description");

           You should almost always return the result of _error() or return
           immediately afterwards.

       _style_defs()
           Returns the style defaults, such as the relationships between line
           color and text color.

           Intended to be over-ridden by base classes to provide graph
           specific defaults.

       $self->_style_setup(\%opts)
           Uses the values from %opts, the custom style set by methods, the
           style set by the style parameter or the set_style() method and the
           built in chart defaults to build a working style.

           The working style features member is also populated with the active
           features for the chart.

           The working style is stored in the "_style" member of $self.

       $self->_get_thing($name)
           Retrieve some general 'thing'.

           Supports the 'lookup(foo)' mechanism.

           Returns an empty list on failure.

       $self->_get_number($name)
           Retrieves a number from the style.  The value in the style can be
           the number, or one of two functions:

           lookup(newname)
               Recursively looks up newname in the style.

           scale(value1,value2)
               Each value can be a number or a name.  Names are recursively
               looked up in the style and the product is returned.

       $self->_get_integer($name)
           Retrieves an integer from the style.  This is a simple wrapper
           around _get_number() that rounds the result to an integer.

           Returns an empty list on failure.

       _get_color($name)
           Returns a color object of the given name from the style hash.

           Uses Imager::Color->new to translate normal scalars into color
           objects.

           Allows the lookup(name) mechanism.

           Returns an empty list on failure.

       _translate_fill($what, $box)
           Given the value of a fill, either attempts to convert it into a
           fill list (one of "<color="$color_value, filled=>1>> or "<fill="{
           fill parameters }>>), or to lookup another fill that is referred to
           with the 'lookup(name)' mechanism.

           This function does the fg and bg initialization for hatched fills,
           and translation of *_ratio for fountain fills (using the $box
           parameter).

           Returns an empty list on failure.

       _data_fill($index, $box)
           Retrieves the fill parameters for a data area fill.

       _get_fill($name, $box)
           Retrieves fill parameters for a named fill.

       _get_line($name)
           Return color (and possibly other) parameters for drawing a line
           with the _line() method.

       _make_img()
           Builds the image object for the graph and fills it with the
           background fill.

       _text_style($name)
           Returns parameters suitable for calls to Imager::Font's
           bounding_box() and draw() methods intended for use in defining text
           styles.

           Returns an empty list on failure.

           Returns the following attributes: font, color, size, aa, sizew
           (optionally)

       _text_bbox($text, $name)
           Returns a bounding box for the specified $text as styled by $name.

           Returns an empty list on failure.

       _line_style($name)
           Return parameters suitable for calls to Imager's line(),
           polyline(), and box() methods.

           For now this returns only color and aa parameters, but future
           releases of Imager may support extra parameters.

       _composite()
           Returns a list of style fields that are stored as composites, and
           should be merged instead of just being replaced.

       _line(x1 => $x1, y1 => $y1, ..., style => $style)
           Wrapper for line drawing, implements styles Imager doesn't.

           Currently styles are limited to horizontal and vertical lines.

       _box(xmin ..., style => $style)
           A wrapper for drawing styled box outlines.

       _feature_enabled($feature_name)
           Check if the given feature is enabled in the work style.
