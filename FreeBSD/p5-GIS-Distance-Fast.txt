GIS::Distance::Fast(3)                     User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       GIS::Distance::Fast - C implementation of GIS::Distance formulas.

DESCRIPTION
       This distribution re-implements some, but not all, of the formulas that
       come with GIS::Distance in the C programming language.  C code is
       generally much faster than the Perl equivalent.

       See "SPEED" in GIS::Distance for some benchmarking and how to run your
       own benchmarks.

       This module need not be used directly.  GIS::Distance will
       automatically use the "GIS::Distance::Fast::*" formulas when installed.

FORMULAS
       •   GIS::Distance::Fast::Cosine

       •   GIS::Distance::Fast::GreatCircle

       •   GIS::Distance::Fast::Haversine

       •   GIS::Distance::Fast::Polar

       •   GIS::Distance::Fast::Vincenty
