NAME
     mpd5 – netgraph multi-link PPP daemon

SYNOPSIS
     mpd5 [-bkov] [-d directory] [-f file] [-p pid-file] [-s ident]
          [-m service] [configuration]

DESCRIPTION
     mpd5 is a user mode PPP daemon using the netgraph(4) networking system.
     By using Netgraph, mpd5 combines the robustness and flexibility of a
     user-mode PPP implementation with the speed and reliability of kernel-
     mode packet forwarding.  All PPP negotiation is handled in user level
     code, while all data intensive operations such as encryption,
     compression, and multi-link framing are handled strictly in the kernel.
     Mpd supports several link layer types, a fully event-driven modem chat
     scripting language, and other features.

     mpd5 creates a ng_ppp(4) netgraph node that is placed between a
     ng_iface(4) netgraph interface one or more link layer devices, performing
     multi-link PPP negotiation and encapsulation. In multi-link PPP a bundle
     is a collection of one or more links between two peers. Each link
     corresponds to some device (e.g., a modem), and each bundle corresponds
     to one netgraph interface.  The idea is to use all of the links, together
     connected to a remote peer also performing multi-link PPP, to utilize
     their combined bandwidth.  Packets routed through the netgraph interface
     travel in multi-link fragments over all of the links.  Each link is a
     normal PPP link and can deliver complete packets as well, so redundancy
     is another benefit.  Attempts to connect two links in the same bundle to
     different peers, or to a peer that is not configured for multi-link PPP,
     will fail.

     In general, everything is controlled by executing commands which are
     either entered via the console command line or read from a configuration
     file. If mpd5 is running as a background daemon, the console can be made
     accessible via telnet(1).  Since commands may apply to a single link, the
     console prompt always shows the current bundle or the current link in
     that bundle.  On startup mpd run commands from the startup label of
     config file.  After that, if configuration is supplied, mpd looks config
     file for a matching label and runs the corresponding commands.  If
     configuration is not supplied, mpd looks for label named default.

ON-LINE MANUAL
     Mpd is fully documented in the mpd manual, which is available in HTML.
     The manual can be found in the directory /usr/local/share/doc/mpd5.

OPTIONS
     Mpd supports the following command options:


     -b
     --background

             Detach from the terminal and run as a background daemon.

     -d dirname
     --directory dirname

             Specify a configuration directory other than the default,
             /usr/local/etc/mpd5.

     -f file
     --file file

             Specify an initial configuration file other than the default,
             mpd.conf.

     -o
     --one-shot

             Terminate daemon after the last link shutdown.

     -p file
     --pidfile file

             Specify an lock/process ID storage file other than the default
             /var/run/mpd.pid.

     -k
     --kill

             Kill any existing mpd5 daemon currently running. The same pidfile
             must be used.

     -s ident
     --syslog-ident ident

             Identifier to use for syslog(3).  The default - mpd

     -m service
     --pam-service service

             Service name to use for pam(3).  The default - mpd

     -v
     --version

             Display the program version and exit.

     -h
     --help

             Display invocation usage and exit.
