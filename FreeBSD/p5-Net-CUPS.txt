NAME
       Net::CUPS - Common Unix Printing System Interface

SYNOPSIS
         use Net::CUPS;

         my $cups = Net::CUPS->new();

         my $printer = $cups->getDestination( "lj4200dn" );

DESCRIPTION
       Net::CUPS is an object oriented interface to the Common Unix Printing
       System.

METHODS
       getDestination
           my $printer = $cups->getDestination( $printer_name );

           This method takes the name of the printer to acquire.  If the
           printer does not exist it will return nothing.

       getDestinations
           my @printers = $cups->getDestinations();

           This method will return an array of destinations currently
           configured on the cups server.

       getPassword
           my $password = $cups->getPassword( $prompt );

           Method to retrieve the password from the user via the password
           callback.

       getPPD
           my $ppd = $cups->getPPD( $name );

           Returns a Net::CUPS::PPD object for the default printer or for the
           specified printer or class.

       getPPDMakes
           my $makes = $cups->getPPDMakes();

           Returns an arrary of scalers holding the names of all the makers
           (e.g. HP or Lexmark) of PPD files installed on the CUPS server

       getAllPPDs
           my $ppds = $cups->getAllPPDs();

           Returns an array of scalers with the maker and model of all the
           PPDs installed on the CUPS server

       getPPDFileName
           $cups->getPPDFileName($ppd_name_and_make);

           Returns the file name of the PPD specified by the name and make as
           found in the array returned by getAllPPDs.  The file name is used
           by addDestination and is relative to where the CUPS server is
           instructed to look (e.g /usr/share/ppd).

       getServer
           my $server_name = $cups->getServer();

           A method to return either the hostname or the IP address of the
           active print server.

       getUsername
           my $username = $cups->getUsername();

           This method will return the current username associated with the
           CUPS transaction.

       requestData
           my $result = $cups->requestData( $request, $resource, $filename );

           Send an IPP request to the server.  This function is based off the
           C CUPS function cupsDoRequest and cupsDoRequestFile.  The $filename
           is optional.

       setPasswordCB
           $cups->setPasswordCB( $function )

           Method to set the callback function to be used by getPassword.

       setServer
           $cups->setServer( $server_ip );

           This method will change the current cups server to another hosts.

       setUsername
           $cups->setUsername( $username );

           A method to change the username associated with CUPS interaction.

       deleteDestination
           $cups->deleteDestination( $destination_name );

           A method to delete an existing destination

       addDestination
           $cups->addDestination( $name, $location, $printer_info, $ppd_name,
           $device_uri) A method to create a new destination.  The $ppd_name
           variable should be the one returned for that printer by the
           getPPDFileName method.  It will be relative to where the CUPS
           server is configured to look for PPD files (e.g. /usr/share/ppd).
