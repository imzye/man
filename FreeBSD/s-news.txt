DESCRIPTION
       Inews reads an article from either each of the specified files in turn
       or standard input, adds the required and specified header lines and
       passed it to rnews(8) with the -q option.

       If the -h option is given the input is assumed to be in the form of
       header, blank line then body.  If not then it is all treated as the
       article body.  If any header line is specifed as a command line
       argument then the command line contents override that read from the
       input.  If any of the header lines that are required by RFC 1036 are
       then missing they are added with default content.

       If the content From header line is overridden either from standard
       input with the -h option or with the -f option and the posting user is
       not the news user then a Sender header line is added.

OPTIONS
       -h     Read header lines from the input as well as the article body.
