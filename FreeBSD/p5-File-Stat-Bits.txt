NAME
       File::Stat::Bits - stat(2) bit mask constants

SYNOPSIS
        use File::stat;
        use File::Stat::Bits;

        my $st = stat($file) or die "Can't stat $file: $!";

        if ( S_ISCHR($st->mode) ) {
               my ($major, $minor) = dev_split( $st->rdev );

               print "$file is character device $major:$minor\n";
        }

        printf "Permissions are %04o\n", $st->mode & ALLPERMS;

       (Too many S_IF* constants to example)

DESCRIPTION
       Lots of Perl modules use the Unix file permissions and type bits
       directly in binary form with risk of non-portability for some exotic
       bits.  Note that the POSIX module does not provides all needed
       constants and I can't wait when the POSIX module will be updated.

       This separate module provides file type/mode bit and more constants
       from sys/stat.ph and sys/sysmacros.ph without pollution caller's
       namespace by other unneeded symbols from these headers.  Most of these
       constants exported by this module are Constant Functions (see perlsub).

       Since some of Perl builds does not include these converted headers, the
       build procedure will generate it for itself in the its own lib
       directory.

       This module also should concentrate all portability and compatibility
       issues.

CONSTANTS

       File type bit masks (for the st_mode field):

        S_IFMT         bitmask for the file type bitfields
        S_IFDIR        directory
        S_IFCHR        character device
        S_IFBLK        block device
        S_IFREG        regular file
        S_IFIFO        fifo (named pipe)
        S_IFLNK        symbolic link
        S_IFSOCK       socket


       File access permission bit masks (for the st_mode field):

        S_IRWXU        mask for file owner permissions
        S_IRUSR        owner has read permission
        S_IWUSR        owner has write permission
        S_IXUSR        owner has execute permission
        S_ISUID        set UID bit

        S_IRWXG        mask for group permissions
        S_IRGRP        group has read permission
        S_IWGRP        group has write permission
        S_IXGRP        group has execute permission
        S_ISGID        set GID bit

        S_IRWXO        mask for permissions for others
        S_IROTH        others have read permission
        S_IWOTH        others have write permisson
        S_IXOTH        others have execute permission
        S_ISVTX        sticky bit

       Common mode bit masks:

        ACCESSPERMS     0777
           ALLPERMS    07777
        DEFFILEMODE     0666

FUNCTIONS

       File type test macros (for the st_mode field):

        S_ISDIR ( mode )       directory?
        S_ISCHR ( mode )       character device?
        S_ISBLK ( mode )       block device?
        S_ISREG ( mode )       regular file?
        S_ISFIFO( mode )       fifo (named pipe)?
        S_ISLNK ( mode )       is it a symbolic link?
        S_ISSOCK( mode )       socket?

       All returns boolean value.


       $major = major( $st_rdev )

       Returns major device number of st_rdev


       $minor = minor( $st_rdev )

       Returns minor device number of st_rdev


       ($major, $minor) = dev_split( $st_rdev )

       Splits st_rdev to major and minor device numbers


       $st_rdev = dev_join( $major, $minor )

       Makes st_rdev from major and minor device numbers (makedev())

NOTE
       If major/minor definitions absent in reasonable set of system C headers
       all major/minor related functions returns undef.
