NAME
       tsocks - Shell wrapper to simplify the use of the tsocks(8) library to
       transparently allow an application to use a SOCKS proxy

SYNOPSIS
       tsocks [application [application's arguments]]
       or tsocks [on|off]
       or tsocks

DESCRIPTION
       tsocks is a wrapper between the tsocks library and the application what
       you would like to run socksified.

OPTIONS
       [application [application's arguments]]
              run the application as specified with the environment
              (LD_PRELOAD) set such that tsocks(8) will transparently proxy
              SOCKS connections in that program

       [on|off]
              this option adds or removes tsocks(8) from the LD_PRELOAD
              environment variable. When tsocks(8) is in this variable all
              executed applications are automatically socksified. If you want
              to use this function, you HAVE to source the shell script from
              yours, like this: "source /usr/local/bin/tsocks" or ".
              /usr/local/bin/tsocks"
              Example:
              ". tsocks on" -- add the tsocks lib to LD_PRELOAD
              ". tsocks off" -- remove the tsocks lib from LD_PRELOAD

       [show|sh]
              show the current value of the LD_PRELOAD variable

       <without any argument>
              create a new shell with LD_PRELOAD including tsocks(8).

       This script was created by Tamas SZERB <toma@rulez.org> for the debian
       package of tsocks. It (along with this manual page) have since been
       adapted into the main tsocks project and modified.
