HTTP::Cookies::iCab(3)                     User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       HTTP::Cookies::iCab - Cookie storage and management for iCab

SYNOPSIS
               use HTTP::Cookies::iCab;

               my $cookie_jar = HTTP::Cookies::iCab->new( $cookies_file );

               # otherwise same as HTTP::Cookies

DESCRIPTION
       This package overrides the load() and save() methods of HTTP::Cookies
       so it can work with iCab 3 cookie files. This doesn't work on iCab 4
       cookie files yet, but if you really need that, convert
       HTTP::Cookies::Safari to do what you need.

       See HTTP::Cookies.
