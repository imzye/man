NAME
       lordsawar-game-host-client - administer or query a game host server

SYNOPSIS
       lordsawar-game-host-client [OPTION...] HOST

DESCRIPTION
       A command-line tool to manage a LordsAWar! game host server located at
       HOST.  Start hosting new games, stop hosting games, or ask it for a
       list of hosted games.

       -p, --profile ID
              Use this identity to make requests to the remote server.  The ID
              looks like a guid.

       -h, --host FILE
              Ask the server to host a new game.  This command uploads FILE to
              the remote server begins a new game with it.  FILE is .map
              scenario file.

       -u, --unhost ID
              Ask the server to stop hosting a game.  The ID looks like a
              guid.

       -p, --port NUMBER
              Connect to the remote server on the given port.

       -t, --terminate
              Ask the server to stop.  The games continue to be hosted, but
              our ability to control them (or host new games), goes away until
              the server starts back up.

       -r, --reload
              Ask the server to reload it's list of hosted games from disk.

       -l, --list
              Ask the server to show a list of games it is hosting.

       -?, --help
              Give this help list.

       When --profile is not specified, the first profile in profiles.xml is
       used by default.  When a --port is not specified, port 22998 is
       assumed.  When HOST is not specified on the command-line, 127.0.0.1 is
       assumed.
