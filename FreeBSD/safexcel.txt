SAFEXCEL(4)            FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual            SAFEXCEL(4)

NAME
     safexcel – Inside Secure SafeXcel-IP-97 security packet engine

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device crypto
           device cryptodev
           device safexcel

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           safexcel_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The safexcel driver implements crypto(4) support for the cryptographic
     acceleration functions of the EIP-97 device found on some Marvell
     systems-on-chip.  The driver can accelerate the following AES modes:

     •   AES-CBC
     •   AES-CTR
     •   AES-XTS
     •   AES-GCM
     •   AES-CCM

     safexcel also implements SHA1 and SHA2 transforms, and can combine AES-
     CBC and AES-CTR with SHA1-HMAC and SHA2-HMAC for encrypt-then-
     authenticate operations.

HISTORY
     The safexcel driver first appeared in FreeBSD 13.0.

FreeBSD 13.1-RELEASE-p2          July 29, 2020         FreeBSD 13.1-RELEASE-p2
