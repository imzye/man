DESCRIPTION
       The original puzzle has 9 squares per face (size = 3).  The puzzle was
       designed by Erno Rubik and called the Rubik's Cube.  This has
       8!*12!*3^8*2^12/12 or 4.3 * 10^19 different combinations.

       The Pocket Cube has 4 squares per face (size = 2) also designed by Erno
       Rubik.  This has 7!*3^6 or 3,674,160 different combinations.

       Rubik's Revenge has 16 squares per face (size = 4) also designed by
       Erno Rubik.  This has 7!*3^6*24!*24!/(4!)^6 or 7.4 * 10^46 different
       combinations.

       5x5x5 Cube.  This has 8!*12!*3^7*2^10*(24!)^3/(4!)^12 or 2.83 * 10^74
       different combinations.

       There is also the Magic Domino 3x3x2 cube which has (8!)^2/4 or
       406,425,600 combinations.

       A physical 6x6x6 cube is possible but to my knowledge no one has been
       too successful in building one.  7x7x7 is also possible, but here one
       must make the center most cubes smaller than the outside cubes, so the
       corners do not fall off when turned.

FEATURES
       Press "mouse-left" button to move a piece.  Release "mouse-left" button
       on a piece on the same face and in the same row.  The pieces will then
       turn towards where the mouse button was released.

       Press "mouse-center", or press "P" or "p" keys to toggle the practice
       mode (in practice mode the record should say "practice").  One must
       double click on "mouse-center" if the puzzle is being worked on.  This
       is good for learning moves and experimenting.

       Click "mouse-right", or press "R" or "r" keys to randomize (this must
       be done first to set a new record).  One must double click on "mouse-
       right" if the puzzle is being worked on.

       Press "I" or "i" keys to increase the number of "cubies".

       Press "D" or "d" keys to decrease the number of "cubies".

       Press "x" key to increase the number of "cubies" along the x axis.

       Press "X" key to decrease the number of "cubies" along the x axis.

       Press "y" key to increase the number of "cubies" along the y axis.

       Press "Y" key to decrease the number of "cubies" along the y axis.

       Press "z" key to increase the number of "cubies" along the z axis.

       Press "Z" key to decrease the number of "cubies" along the z axis.

       Press "O" or "o" keys to toggle the orient mode.  One has to orient the
       faces in orient mode, besides getting all the faces to be the same
       color.  To do this one has to get the lines to be oriented in the same
       direction, this only matters with center "cubies", if at all (i.e.
       those "cubies" not on a corner or edge).  This does add complexity so
       there are 2 sets of records.

       "S" or "s" to start auto-solver.  Only works on 1x1x1, 2x2x2, and 3x3x3
       cubes (3x3x3 cube in non-orient mode).

       Press "U" or "u" keys to undo move.

       Press "G" or "g" keys to get a saved puzzle.

       Press "W" or "w" keys to write or save a puzzle.

       Press "Q", "q", or "CTRL-C" keys to kill program.

       Use the key pad, "R" keys, or arrow keys to move without mouse clicks.
       Key pad is defined for the Rubik2d as:
         /     Counterclockwise

         8     Up
         ^
       4<5>6   Left, Clockwise, Right
         v
         2     Down

       Key pad for Rubik3d, use must use your intuition (is this a cop out or
       what?).  The key pad is defined differently depending on which side of
       the cube your mouse is pointing at.  One thing that stays the same is
       "5" is Clockwise and "/" is Counterclockwise.

       Use the control key and the left mouse button, keypad, or arrow keys to
       move the whole cube.  This is not recorded as a turn.

       The title is in the following format (non-motif version):
              xrubik{2|3}d<dimension>: {1|2|3|4|5|6<cubes per edge on x-
              axis>x{1|2|3|4|5|6<cubes per edge on y-axis>x{1|2|3|4|5|6<cubes
              per edge on z-axis>} @ (<Number of moves>/{<Record number of
              moves> <username>|"NEVER noaccess"|"practice"}) - <Comment>
       If there is no record of the current puzzle, it displays "NEVER
       noaccess".

OPTIONS
       -geometry {+|-}X{+|-}Y
               This option sets the initial position of the rubik window
               (resource name "geometry").

       -display host:dpy
               This option specifies the X server to contact.

       -[no]mono
               This option allows you to  display on a color screen as if
               monochrome (resource name "mono").

       -[no]{reverse|rv}
               This option allows you to see the rubik window in reverse video
               (resource name "reverse").

       -{foreground|fg} color
               This option specifies the foreground of the rubik window
               (resource name "foreground").

       -{background|bg} color
               This option specifies the background of the rubik window
               (resource name "background").

       -{border|bd} color
               This option specifies the border color of the "cubies" in the
               rubik window (resource name "borderColor").

       -face{0|1|2|3|4|5} <color>
               This option allows you to change the color of a face (resource
               name "faceColorN"). In mono-mode, color is represented as the
               first letter of the color name. On the 2-D version, the faces
               are ordered top to bottom and left to right on the "t"
               configuration. The sideways "t" or "+-" configuration is
               physically consistent with the former, so it is ordered "0, 1,
               2, 3, 5, 4".  If you has two colors that begin with the same
               letter you should have one in uppercase and one in lowercase to
               distinguish them in mono-mode. You can change the colors of the
               faces to make a stupid cube (i.e.  all White or in mono-mode
               all "W"). Unfortunately, it will not normally say its solved
               when its randomized. This would be cheating.

       -sizex <int>
               This option allows you to change the number of "cubies" on a
               edge along x-axis (resource name "sizex").

       -sizey <int>
               This option allows you to change the number of "cubies" on a
               edge along y-axis (resource name "sizey").

       -sizez <int>
               This option allows you to change the number of "cubies" on a
               edge along z-axis (resource name "sizez").

       -[no]orient
               This option allows you to access the orient mode (resource name
               "orient").

       -[no]practice
               This option allows you to access the practice mode (resource
               name "practice").

       -username string
               This option specifies the user name for any records made or
               else it will get your login name (resource name "userName").

SAVE FORMAT
       The format is not standard.  The reason is that this is simple to
       produce and the standard notation is no good for variable number of
       "cubies".

       Rubik2d with default colors, not randomized (front is face 2) :
         0       R     Red
       1 2 3   Y W G   Yellow, White, Green
         4       O     Orange
         5       B     Blue

              sizex: 1-6 <the number of cubes per row along x-axis>
              sizey: 1-6 <the number of cubes per row along y-axis>
              sizez: 1-6 <the number of cubes per row along z-axis>
              orient: 0-1 <0 false, 1 true; if 1 then lines on "cubies" to be
              oriented>
              practice: 0-1 <0 false, 1 true>
              moves: 0-MAXINT <total number of moves>

              startingPosition: <2 dimensional array of face and cubie
              position, each face has size * size "cubies", if orient mode
              then orientation number follows face number: 0 up, 1 right, 2
              down, and 3 left>

       This is then followed by the moves, starting from 1.
              move #: <face> <position> <direction> <control>
       Each turn is with respect to a face and position.
       Position is 0 to size * size - 1.  Position 0 is in the upper left.
       Direction is represented as 0 up, 1 right, 2 down, 3 left, 5 clockwise,
       and 7 counterclockwise.
       Control is represented as 0 or 1, 1 if the whole cube is moved at once
       (here position does not matter), 0 if not.  The xrubik record keeper
       does not count a control move as a move, but here we do.

       Caution: the program may crash on corrupted input.

       If you have a Rubik's cube you can not solve (2x2x2 or 3x3x3) enter it
       in rubik.data file.  Have size = 2 or 3, orient = 0, practice = 0,
       randomized = 1, and moves = 0 and the number representation for the
       color of the "cubie" faces (usually 0=R, 1=Y, 2=W, 3=G, 4=O, 5=B).
       Bring up xrubik, hit 'g' so it will get your configuration and then 's'
       to solve your cube and then 'w' to write out the steps.  Then examine
       your rubik.data file.
