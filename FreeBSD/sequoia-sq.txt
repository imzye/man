NAME
       sq-cert-export - Export certificates from the local certificate store

SYNOPSIS
       sq cert export [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       Export certificates from the local certificate store.

       If multiple predicates are specified a certificate is returned if at
       least one of them matches.

       This does not check the authenticity of the certificates in anyway.
       Before using the certificates, be sure to validate and authenticate
       them.

       When matching on subkeys or User IDs, the component must have a valid
       self signature according to the policy.

       Fails if search criteria are specified and none of them matches any
       certificates.  Note: this means if the certificate store is empty and
       no search criteria are specified, then this will return success.



OPTIONS
   Subcommand options
       --all  Export all certificates

       --cert=FINGERPRINT|KEYID
              Use certificates with the specified fingerprint or key ID

       --cert-domain=DOMAIN
              Use certificates where a user ID includes an email address for
              the specified domain

       --cert-email=EMAIL
              Use certificates where a user ID includes the specified email
              address

       --cert-grep=PATTERN
              Use certificates with a user ID that matches the pattern, case
              insensitively

       --cert-userid=USERID
              Use certificates with the specified user ID

       --local
              Export local (non-exportable) signatures

              By default, non-exportable signatures are not emitted when
              exporting certificates, certificate components that are only
              bound by non-exportable signatures are not emitted, and
              certificates consisting of only non-exportable components are
              not emitted.

              This flag enables exporting of non-exportable signatures,
              components, and certs.  This is useful for synchronization
              between ones devices, for example.

       --output=FILE
              Write to FILE or stdout if omitted

              [default: -]

   Global options
       See sq(1) for a description of the global options.

EXAMPLES
       Export certificates with a User ID containing the email address.

              sq cert export --cert-email=alice@example.org



       Export certificates that contain a User ID with *either* (not both!)
       email address.

              sq cert export --cert-email=alice@example.org \
                     --cert-email=bob@example.org
