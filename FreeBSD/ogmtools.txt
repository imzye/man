NAME
       ogmcat - Concatenate several OGG/OGM files into one big OGG/OGM file

SYNOPSIS
       ogmcat [options] -o outname inname1 [inname2 [inname3 ...]]

DESCRIPTION
       ogmcat does NOT work at the moment. It is work in progress. I included
       it just out of laziness (otherwise I'd have to remove it from the
       Makefile/configure stuff prior to releasing this version).

       ogmcat can be used to concatenate several OGG/OGM files into one big
       file if they are of the same type. For a more in-depth description
       refer to the LIMITATIONS section.

       -o, --output outname
              Output to 'outname'.

       inname1
              Use 'inname1', 'inname2' etc as the sources.

       -m, --manualsync n
              Specifies a manual sync value in ms that will be added to each
              stream's presentation timestamps along with the value calculated
              by the chosen sync algorithm (see the -s option). This option
              can be used for each input file although it has no effect if
              used for the first one as well.

       -s, --sync nr
              Uses sync mode nr. Valid values are 0 - 4. The default value is
              shown on ogmcat's help screen.

       -n, --nosafetychecks
              Disable the safety checks made prior to the concatenating. The
              resulting file may be unplayable. See the LIMITATIONS section
              for further details.

       -v, --verbose
              Be verbose and show each OGG packet.  Can be used twice to
              increase verbosity.

       -h, --help
              Show this help.

       -V, --version
              Show version information.

LIMITATIONS
       Concatenating streams is difficult at the best and might even be
       impossible.  Therefore ogmcat makes very strict comparisons between the
       streams contained in the input files. The checks done include:

       *      general: All streams with the same serial number must be of the
              same type (video, audio, Vorbis audio or text streams).

       *      general: If a stream exists in one file it must in the other
              files as well.

       *      video streams: The codec FourCC, width, height and FPS must
              match.

       *      Vorbis streams: The sample rate and the number of channels must
              match.

       *      other audio streams: The codec ID, sample rate, bits per sample
              and number of channels must match.

       *      text/subtitle streams: The 'time unit' must match.

       The user can forcefully override the last four checks with the -n
       parameter. The checks marked as 'general' cannot be overridden this
       way.

       Audio/video synchronization might not be ok in the resulting file even
       if the source files were perfectly in sync. The user can experiment
       with the -s parameter which causes ogmcat to use slightly different
       algorithms for calculating the granulepos values for the audio and text
       streams. The range of valid parameters will be printed on ogmcat's help
       screen.

       If none of the synchronization algorithms provided works correctly then
       the user can also manually add a synchronization offset using the -m
       option for each input file.
