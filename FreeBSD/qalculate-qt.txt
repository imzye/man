       (such as currency conversion and percent calculation). Features include
       a large library of customizable functions, unit calculations and
       conversion, physical constants, symbolic calculations (including
       integrals and equations), arbitrary precision, uncertainty propagation,
       interval arithmetic, plotting, and a user-friendly interface.
