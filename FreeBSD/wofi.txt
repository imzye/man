NAME
       wofi - A rofi inspired launcher for wlroots compositors


SYNOPSIS
       wofi [options]


DESCRIPTION
       wofi is a rofi inspired menu program for wlroots compositors such as
       sway. It is intended to be highly customizable and flexible with the
       help of CSS styling and a dmenu mode that allows for endless
       scriptability. Wofi can be run cacheless in dmenu mode automatically by
       invoking it as dmenu with symlink.

       Wofi was designed specifically for wlroots and makes use of the
       wlr-layer-shell protocol. If your compositor does not support this
       protocol or if you are in a non-wayland environment then wofi must be
       run with --normal-window or it will crash. If you wish to run wofi this
       way you can also place normal_window=true in your config file to avoid
       specifying the option on the command line.

              can be anything. Suggested to use with "echo %s | some_cmd" or
              "some_cmd %s", as the string gets replaced in a printf-like
              fashion. This will not affect the output of wofi once a
              selection has been done, allowing you to display something else
              than the original output.



CONFIGURATION
       Wofi has 3 main files used for configuration. All files are completely
       optional.

       1.  The config file which defaults to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wofi/config.

       2.  The CSS file which defaults to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wofi/style.css.

       3.  The colors file which defaults to the pywal cache
           $XDG_CACHE_HOME/wal/colors.


       All 3 of these paths can be manually specified using the respective
       command line flag. In the case of the last 2 they can additionally be
       specified in the config file.

       In the event $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not specified it defaults to ~/.config
       likewise if $XDG_CACHE_HOME is not specified it defaults to ~/.cache.

       Information about the formats for these files can be found in wofi(5).

                                                                       wofi(1)
