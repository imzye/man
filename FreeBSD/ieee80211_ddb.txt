IEEE80211_DDB(9)       FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual      IEEE80211_DDB(9)

NAME
     ieee80211_ddb – 802.11 ddb support

SYNOPSIS
     options DDB

     show vap [addr]
     show all vaps
     show com [addr]
     show sta [addr]
     show statab [addr]
     show mesh [addr]

DESCRIPTION
     The net80211 layer includes ddb(4) support for displaying important data
     structures.  This is especially important because wireless applications
     are often built for embedded environments where cross-machine or post-
     mortem debugging facilities like kgdb(1) are infeasible.

     The most commonly used command is

           show all vaps/a

     which dumps the contents of all ieee80211vap, ieee80211com, and
     ieee80211_node data structures in the system.
