NAME
       Text::Table::TinyColor - Text::Table::Tiny + support for colored text

VERSION
       This document describes version 0.002 of Text::Table::TinyColor (from
       Perl distribution Text-Table-TinyColor), released on 2016-10-19.

SYNOPSIS
        use Term::ANSIColor;
        use Text::Table::TinyColor qw/ generate_table /;

        my $rows = [
            # header row
            [colored(['bright_green'],'Name'), colored(['bright_green'],'Rank'), colored(['bright_green'],'Serial')],
            # rows
            ['alice', 'pvt', '123456'],
            ['bob',   'cpl', '98765321'],
            ['carol', 'brig gen', colored(['bold'], '8745')],
        ];
        print generate_table(rows => $rows, header_row => 1);

DESCRIPTION
       This module is like Text::Table::Tiny (0.04) with added support for
       colored text (text that contains ANSI color codes). With this module,
       the colored text will still line up.

       Interface, options, and format variables are the same as in
       Text::Table::Tiny.
