AUTOCUTSEL(1)           FreeBSD General Commands Manual          AUTOCUTSEL(1)

NAME
       autocutsel - keep the X clipboard and the cutbuffer in sync

SYNOPSIS
       autocutsel [-selection selection_name] [-cutbuffer number] [-debug]
       [-verbose] [-fork] [-pause milliseconds] [-buttonup]


DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the autocutsel command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the
       original program does not have a manual page.

       autocutsel tracks changes in the server's cutbuffer and clipboard
       selection.  When the clipboard is changed, it updates the cutbuffer.
       When the cutbuffer is changed, it owns the clipboard selection.  The
       cutbuffer and clipboard selection are always synchronized.  Since the
       VNC client synchronizes the Windows' clipboard and the server's
       cutbuffer, all three "clipboards" are always kept synchronized.  When
       you copy some text in Windows, the cutbuffer and the clipboard
       selection are updated.  When you copy text on the server using either
       the cutbuffer or the clipboard selection, the Windows's clipboard is
       always updated.


OPTIONS
       -selection, -select, -sel, -s {CLIPBOARD|PRIMARY}
              Specify which selection to use.  Default is CLIPBOARD.


       -cutbuffer <number>
              (Details of this parameter unknown.)


       -debug, -d
              Run with debugging mode.


       -verbose, -v
              Be more verbose.  Reports the version and announces
              synchronizations.


       -fork, -f
              Run as a daemon program in the background.  This is recommended
              when used from an X startup script.


       -pause, -p <milliseconds>
              Wait some milliseconds before owning the selection.


       -buttonup
              Get the selection only when the button 1 is not pressed.  This
              may help with OpenOffice Writer.
