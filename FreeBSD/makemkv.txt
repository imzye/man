MAKEMKVCON(1)           FreeBSD General Commands Manual          MAKEMKVCON(1)

NAME
     makemkvcon – read video from DVD or Bluray disc and convert to mkv format

SYNOPSIS
     makemkvcon [--minlength=seconds] info source_spec
     makemkvcon [--minlength=seconds] mkv source_spec title_spec
                target_directory

DESCRIPTION
     The makemkvcon utility shows information about a video disc in an optical
     drive, the mkv subcommand also converts selected titles from the disc to
     .mkv files in a given location.

     The arguments are as follows:

     --minlength=seconds
             Only consider video titles with a minimal length of seconds. If
             you use the mkv subcommand after the info subcommand, make sure
             to pass the same value for seconds, as filtering out titles with
             a smaller length happens before numbering the titles.

     source_spec
             Read video disc from the given source.  Use “disc:0” here to have
             makemkvcon read from the first video disc it can find.

     title_spec
             Determines which titles to read.  This can be either a whole
             number from 0 to n-1 for a disc with n titles to read exactly one
             title, or the string “all” to read all titles found.

     target_directory
             The path where to store the converted .mkv files.

FILES
     ~/.MakeMKV/settings.conf
             You may put a license key in this file in the following format:
                   app_Key = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX..."
             You can either buy a license or use the key, that is freely
             available as long as MakeMKV is in beta from
             https://www.makemkv.com/forum/.

EXAMPLES
           % makemkvcon mkv disc:0 0 .

     This command reads the first title from the first disc it can find and
     stores a converted .mkv file in the current directory.

BUGS
     On FreeBSD, makemkvcon crashes with a signal 11 (segmentation fault)
     after finishing its job.  Be aware this might leave a .core file on your
     file system.

KNOWN ISSUES
     To find optical drives, makemkvcon uses some entries from Linux' sysfs
     that aren't present on FreeBSD.  A script `update-makemkv-drives` is
     included to fake these entries and is run automatically on installation.
     If your system's configuration changes, you must run this script as root
     manually, so new or changed drives can be found.
