NAME
       lemonbar - Featherweight lemon-scented bar

SYNOPSIS
       lemonbar [-h | -g widthxheight+x+y | -b | -d | -f font | -p | -n name |
       -u pixel | -B color | -F color | -U color | -o offset ]

DESCRIPTION
       lemonbar (formerly known as bar) is a lightweight bar entirely based on
       XCB. Provides full UTF-8 support, basic formatting, RandR and Xinerama
       support and EWMH compliance without wasting your precious memory.

OPTIONS
       -h  Display the help and exit.

       -g widthxheight+x+y
           Set the window geometry. If a parameter is omitted it's filled with
           the default value. If the y parameter is specified along with the
           -b switch then the position is relative to the bottom of the
           screen.

       -b  Dock the bar at the bottom of the screen.

       -d  Force docking without asking the window manager. This is needed if
           the window manager isn't EWMH compliant.

       -f font
           Define the font to load into one of the five slots (the number of
           slots is hardcoded and can be tweaked by changing the
           MAX_FONT_COUNT parameter in the source code). This version supports
           fontconfig font specifiers and anti-aliased fonts.

       -a number
           Set number of clickable areas (default is 10)

       -p  Make the bar permanent, don't exit after the standard input is
           closed.

       -n name
           Set the WM_NAME atom value for the bar.

       -u pixel
           Sets the underline width in pixels. The default is 1.

       -B color
           Set the background color of the bar. color must be specified in the
           hex format (#aarrggbb, #rrggbb, #rgb). If no compositor such as
           compton or xcompmgr is running the alpha channel is silently
           ignored.

       -F color
           Set the foreground color of the bar. Accepts the same color formats
           as -B.

       -o offset
           Add a vertical offset to the text. offset must be a number and can
           be negative. -o -3 will push the text 3 pixels up.

       -U color
           Set the underline color of the bar. Accepts the same color formats
           as -B.

FORMATTING
       lemonbar provides a screenrc-inspired formatting syntax to allow full
       customization at runtime. Every formatting block is opened with "%{"
       and closed by "}" and accepts the following commands, the parser tries
       its best to handle malformed input. Use "%%" to get a literal percent
       sign ("%").

       R   Swap the current background and foreground colors.

       l   Aligns the following text to the left side of the screen.

       c   Aligns the following text to the center of the screen.

       r   Aligns the following text to the right side of the screen.

       Owidth
           Offset the current position by width pixels in the alignment
           direction.

       Bcolor
           Set the text background color. The parameter color can be - or a
           color in one of the formats mentioned before. The special value -
           resets the color to the default one.

       Fcolor
           Set the text foreground color. The parameter color can be - or a
           color in one of the formats mentioned before. The special value -
           resets the color to the default one.

       Tindex
           Set the font used to draw the following text. The parameter index
           can either be - or the 1-based index of the slot which contains the
           desired font. If the parameter is - lemonbar resets to the normal
           behavior (matching the first font that can be used for the
           character). If the selected font can't be used to draw a character,
           lemonbar will fall back to normal behavior for that character

       Ucolor
           Set the text underline color. The parameter color can be - or a
           color in one of the formats mentioned before. The special value -
           resets the color to the default one.

       Abutton:command:
           Create a clickable area starting from the current position, when
           the area is clicked command is printed on stdout. The area is
           closed when a A token, not followed by : is encountered.

           Eg. %{A:reboot:} Click here to reboot %{A}

           The button field is optional, it defaults to the left button, and
           it's a number ranging from 1 to 5 which maps to the left, middle,
           right, scroll up and scroll down movements. Your mileage may vary.

           Nested clickable areas can trigger different commands.

           Eg. %{A:reboot:}%{A3:halt:} Left click to reboot, right click to
           shutdown %{A}%{A}

       Sdir
           Change the monitor the bar is rendered to. dir can be either

           +/- Next/previous monitor.

           f/l First/last monitor.

           0-9 Nth monitor.

       Attribute modifiers

       +attribute
           Set the attribute attribute for the following text.

       -attribute
           Unset the attribute attribute for the following text.

       !attribute
           Toggle the attribute attribute for the following text.

       Where attribute is one of the following

       o   Draw a line over the text.

       u   Draw a line under the text.

OUTPUT
       Clicking on an area makes lemonbar output the command to stdout,
       followed by a newline, allowing the user to pipe it into a script,
       execute it or simply ignore it. Simple and powerful, that's it.
