NAME
       Config::Model::Backend::Yaml - Read and write config as a YAML data
       structure

VERSION
       version 2.134

SYNOPSIS
        use Config::Model ;
        use Data::Dumper ;

        # define configuration tree object
        my $model = Config::Model->new ;
        $model ->create_config_class (
           name => "MyClass",
           element => [
               [qw/foo bar/] => {
                   type => 'leaf',
                   value_type => 'string'
               },
               baz => {
                   type => 'hash',
                   index_type => 'string' ,
                   cargo => {
                       type => 'leaf',
                       value_type => 'string',
                   },
               },
           ],
         rw_config  => {
           backend => 'yaml',
           config_dir => '/tmp',
           file  => 'foo.yml',
           auto_create => 1,
         }
        ) ;

        my $inst = $model->instance(root_class_name => 'MyClass' );

        my $root = $inst->config_root ;

        my $steps = 'foo=yada bar="bla bla" baz:en=hello
                    baz:fr=bonjour baz:hr="dobar dan"';
        $root->load( steps => $steps ) ;
        $inst->write_back ;

       Now, "/tmp/foo.yml" contains:

        ---
        bar: bla bla
        baz:
          en: hello
          fr: bonjour
          hr: dobar dan
        foo: yada

DESCRIPTION
       This module is used directly by Config::Model to read or write the
       content of a configuration tree written with YAML syntax in
       "Config::Model" configuration tree.

       Note:

       •   Undefined values are skipped for list element. I.e. if a list
           element contains "('a',undef,'b')", the data structure contains
           'a','b'.

       •   YAML file is not created (and may be deleted) when no data is to be
           written.

   Class with only one hash element
       If the root node contains a single hash or list element, only the
       content of this hash is written in a YAML file.

       For example, if a class contains:

             element => [
               baz => {
                   type => 'hash',
                   index_type => 'string' ,
                   cargo => {
                       type => 'leaf',
                       value_type => 'string',
                   },
               },

       If the configuration is loaded with:

        $root->load("baz:one=un baz:two=deux")

       Then the written YAML file does not show "baz":

        ---
        one: un
        two: deux

       Likewise, a YAML file for a class with a single list "baz" element
       would be written with:

        ---
        - un
        - deux

YAML class
       As of v2.129, this backend uses YAML::XS 0.69 or later.

       For security reason, loading a Perl blessed object is disabled.

       Value of type boolean are written as boolean values in YAML files.

backend parameter
   yaml_class
       This parameter is ignored as of version 2.129.

CONSTRUCTOR
   new
       Parameters: "( node => $node_obj, name => 'yaml' )"

       Inherited from Config::Model::Backend::Any. The constructor is called
       by Config::Model::BackendMgr.

   read
       Read YAML file and load into $node_obj tree.

       When a file is read, "read" returns 1.

   write
       Write YAML File using $node_obj data.

       "write" returns 1.
