NAME
       Chemistry::File::XYZ - XYZ molecule format reader/writer

SYNOPSIS
           use Chemistry::File::XYZ;

           # read an XYZ file
           my $mol = Chemistry::Mol->read("myfile.xyz");

           # write an XYZ file
           $mol->write("out.xyz");

DESCRIPTION
       This module reads XYZ files. It automatically registers the 'xyz'
       format with Chemistry::Mol, so that XYZ files may be identified and
       read by Chemistry::Mol->read().

       The XYZ format is not strictly defined and there are various versions
       floating around; this module accepts the following:

       First line: atom count (optional)

       Second line: molecule name or comment (optional)

       All other lines: (symbol or atomic number), x, y, and z coordinates
       separated by spaces, tabs, or commas.

       If the first line doesn't look like a number, the atom count is deduced
       from the number of lines in the file. If the second line looks like it
       defines an atom, it is assumed that there was no name or comment.

OUTPUT OPTIONS
       On writing, the default format is the following, giving H2 as an
       example.

           2
           Hydrogen molecule
           H    0.0000   0.0000   0.0000
           H    0.0000   0.7000   0.0000

       That is: count line, name line, and atom lines (symbol, x, y, z). These
       format can be modified by means of certain options:

       name
           Control whether or not to include the name.

       count
           Control whether or not to include the count line.

       symbol
           If false, use the atomic numbers instead of the atomic symbols.

       For example,

           $mol->write("out.xyz", count => 0, name => 0, symbol => 0);

       gives the following output:

           1    0.0000   0.0000   0.0000
           1    0.0000   0.7000   0.0000
