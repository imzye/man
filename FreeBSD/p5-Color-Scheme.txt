DESCRIPTION
       This module is a Perl implementation of Color Schemes 2
       (<http://wellstyled.com/tools/colorscheme2/>), a color scheme
       generator.  Start by visiting the Color Schemes 2 web site and playing
       with the colors.  When you want to generate those schemes on the fly,
       begin using this module.  The descriptions herein don't make too much
       sense without actually seeing the colorful results.

       Henceforth, paragraphs in quotes denote documentation copied from Color
       Schemes 2.

       "Important note: This tool doesn't use the standard HSV or HSB model
       (the same HSV/HSB values ie. in Photoshop describe different colors!).
       The color wheel used here differs from the RGB spectre used on computer
       screens, it's more in accordance with the classical color theory. This
       is also why some colors (especially shades of blue) make less bright
       shades than the basic colors of the RGB-model. In plus, the RGB-model
       uses red-green-blue as primary colors, but the red-yellow-blue
       combination is used here. This deformation also causes incompatibility
       in color conversions from RGB-values. Therefore, the RGB input (eg. the
       HTML hex values like #F854A9) is not exact, the conversion is rough and
       sometimes may produce slightly different color."

PERL VERSION
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It
       should work on any version of perl released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made
       that the minimum required version will not be increased.  The version
       may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

METHODS
   new
       The "new" method will return a new "Color::Scheme" object.

   colors
       Returns an array of 4, 8, 12 or 16 colors in "RRGGBB" hexidecimal
       notation (without a leading "#") depending on the color scheme and
       addComplement parameter. For each set of four, the first is usually the
       most saturated color, the second a darkened version, the third a pale
       version and fourth a less-pale version.

       For example: With a contrast scheme, "colors()" would return eight
       colors.  Indexes 1 and 5 could be background colors, 2 and 6 could be
       foreground colors.

       Trust me, it's much better if you check out the Color Scheme web site,
       whose URL is listed in in "DESCRIPTION".

   colorset
       Returns a list of lists of the colors in groups of four. This method
       simply allows you to reference a color in the scheme by its group
       isntead of its absolute index in the list of colors.  I am assuming
       that "colorset()" will make it easier to use this module with the
       templating systems that are out there.

       For example, if you were to follow the synopsis, say you wanted to
       retrieve the two darkest colors from the first two groups of the
       scheme, which is typically the second color in the group. You could
       retrieve them with "colors()":

           my $first_background  = ($scheme->colors)[1];
           my $second_background = ($scheme->colors)[5];

       Or, with this method,

           my $first_background  = $scheme->colorset->[0][1];
           my $second_background = $scheme->colorset->[1][1];

   from_hue
         $scheme->from_hue( $degrees )

       Sets the base color hue, where "degrees" is an integer. (Values greater
       than 359 and less than 0 wrap back around the wheel.)

       The default base hue is 0, or bright red.

   from_hex
         $scheme->from_hex( $color )

       Sets the base color to the given color, where "color" is in the
       hexidecimal form RRGGBB. "color" should not be preceded with a hash
       (#).

       The default base color is the equivalent of #ff0000, or bright red.

   add_complement
         $scheme->add_complement( $bool )

       If $bool is true, an extra set of colors will be produced using the
       complement of the selected color.

       This only works with the analogic color scheme. The default is false.

   web_safe
         $scheme->web_safe( $bool )

       Sets whether the colors returned by "colors()" or "colorset()" will be
       web-safe.

       The default is false.

   distance
         $scheme->distance( $float )

       $float must be a value from 0 to 1. You might use this with the
       "triade", "tetrade" or "analogic" color schemes.

       The default is 0.5.

   scheme
         $scheme->scheme( $name )

       $name must be a valid color scheme name. See "COLOR SCHEMES". The
       default is "mono".

   variation
         $scheme->variation( $name )

       $name must be a valid color variation name. See "COLOR VARIATIONS".

COLOR SCHEMES
       The following documentation is adapated (and mostly copied verbatim)
       from the Color Schemes 2 help.  Use one of these scheme names as an
       argument to the "scheme()" method.

   monochromatic (or mono)
       "Monochormatic scheme is based on only one color tint, and uses only
       variations made by changing its saturation and brightness. Black and
       white colors are always added. The result is comfortable for eyes, even
       when using aggressive color. However, it's harder to find accents and
       highlights.

       "The application makes only several monochromatic variants of each
       color. You'll be able to make others - more or less saturated, lighter
       or darker.  Monochromatic variations are made for each color in other
       schemes, too."

   contrast
       "Base color is supplemented with its complement (color on the opposite
       side of the wheel). One warm and one cold color is always created - we
       have to consider, which one will be dominant, and if the result should
       look warm, or cold. Suitable monochromatic variations of this two
       colors may be added to the scheme."

   triade
       "Base color is supplemented with two colors, placed identically on both
       sides of its complement. Unlike the 'sharp' contrast, this scheme is
       often more comfortable for the eyes, it's softer, and has more space
       for balancing warm and cold colors.

       "You can use the "distance()" method to set the distance of these
       colors from the base color complement. The less the value is, the
       closer the colors are to the contrast color, and are more similar. The
       best value is between 0.25 and 0.5. Higher values aren't too suitable -
       except the shift by 60°, which makes another color scheme, the triade:

       "The triade is made by three colors evenly distributed on the thirds of
       the color wheel (by 120 degrees). The triade-schemes are vibrating,
       full of energy, and have large space to make contrasts, accents and to
       balance warm and cold colors. You can make the triade in the 'soft
       contrast' scheme setting the distance to the maximal value, 1."

   tetrade
       "This scheme, also known as 'double-contrast,' is made by a pair of
       colors and their complements. It's based on the tetrade - the foursome
       of colors evenly distributed on the fourths of the color wheel (by 90
       degreees). The tetrade is very aggressive color scheme, requiring very
       good planning and very sensitive approach to relations of these colors.

       "Less distance between two base colors causes less tension in the
       result.  However, this scheme is always more 'nervous' and 'action'
       than other schemes.  While working with it, we have to take care
       especially of relations between one color and the complement of its
       adjacent color - in case of the tetrade (maximum distance 1), good
       feeling and very sensitive approach are necessary."

   analogic
       "This scheme is made by base color and its adjacent colors - two colors
       identically on both sides. It always looks very elegantly and clear,
       the result has less tension and it's uniformly warm, or cold. If a
       color on the warm-cold border is chosen, the color with opposite
       'temperature' may be used for accenting the other two colors.

       "You can set the distance of adjacent colors by using "distance()".
       Values between 0.25 and 0.5 (15-30 degrees on the wheel) are optimal.
       You can also add the contrast color; the scheme is then supplemented
       with the complement of the base color. It must be treated only as a
       complement - it adds tension to the palette, and it's too aggressive
       when overused. However, used in details and as accent of main colors,
       it can be very effective and elegant."

COLOR VARIATIONS
       "Each of colors in displayed scheme has four variations. These are
       colors of the same hue, but they differ in the saturation and
       brightness. ... The very first variation ... is the base variation,
       which determines the look of the scheme. The other three variations are
       just additional. Iff the scheme is made by less than four colors, the
       unused place is used to display variations (or the complement) of the
       base color."

       Use one of these variation names as an argument to the "variation()"
       method.

   default
       The default preset. Generally pretty nice.

   pastel
       Softer colors with added whiteness.

   soft
       Darker pastel colors.

   light
       Very light, almost washed-out colors.

   hard
       Deeper, more-saturated colors.

   pale
       Greyer, less-saturated colors.
