NAME
       webresolve, splitwr


SYNOPSIS
       webresolve < access_log > access_log.resolved

       splitwr access_log > access_log.resolved


DESCRIPTION
       Webresolve is used in conjunction with a log analyzer to get host names
       rather than IP addresses in the statistics. Preprocess the log files
       with webresolve to replace IP addresses with host names.

       The load from webresolve is very light, because it spends most of its
       time waiting for the resolver. This also means that large files can
       take quite some time to process. The solution is to split the log file
       and run several resolution processes in parallel. This is done by the
       script splitwr.

       By default, splitwr runs 20 parallel resolution processes. The number
       can be changed by editing the script.
