              * enable         enable given backends
              * disable        disable given backends

              * remove         remove a backend
              * list-modules   list modules

       cd [PATH]
              Follow a path.
              ".." is a special case and goes up one directory.
              "" is a special case and goes home.

       condition [EXPRESSION | off]
              If an argument is given, set the condition expression used to
              filter the results. See CONDITION section for more details and
              the expression.
              If the "off" value is given, conditional filtering is disabled.

              If no argument is given, print the current condition expression.

       count [NUMBER | off]
              If an argument is given, set the maximum number of results
              fetched.
              NUMBER must be at least 1.
              "off" value disables counting, and allows infinite searches.

              If no argument is given, print the current count value.

       formatter [list | FORMATTER [COMMAND] | option OPTION_NAME [on | off]]
              If a FORMATTER is given, set the formatter to use.
              You can add a COMMAND to apply the formatter change only to
              a given command.

              If the argument is "list", print the available formatters.

              If the argument is "option", set the formatter options.
              Valid options are: header, keys.
              If on/off value is given, set the value of the option.
              If not, print the current value for the option.

              If no argument is given, print the current formatter.

       logging [LEVEL]
              Set logging level.

              Availables: debug, info, warning, error.
              * quiet is an alias for error
              * default is an alias for warning

       ls [-d] [-U] [PATH]
              List objects in current path.
              If an argument is given, list the specified path.
              Use -U option to not sort results. It allows you to use a "fast
              path" to
              return results as soon as possible.
              Use -d option to display information about a collection (and to
              not
              display the content of it). It has the same behavior than the
              well
              known UNIX "ls" command.

              Default is limited to 40 results.

       quit
              Quit the application.

       select [FIELD_NAME]... | "$direct" | "$full"
              If an argument is given, set the selected fields.
              $direct selects all fields loaded in one http request.
              $full selects all fields using as much http requests as
              necessary.

              If no argument is given, print the currently selected fields.

              select output formatter (band_info, band_search, csv,
              get_albums, get_favorites, htmltable, json, json_line,

       -O OUTFILE, --outfile=OUTFILE
              file to export result


CONDITION
       The -c and --condition is a flexible way to filter and get only
       interesting results. It supports conditions on numerical values, dates,
       durations and strings. Dates are given in YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-MM-DD
       HH:MM format. Durations look like XhYmZs where X, Y and Z are integers.
       Any of them may be omitted. For instance, YmZs, XhZs or Ym are
       accepted.  The syntax of one expression is "field operator value". The
       field to test is always the left member of the expression.

       The field is a member of the objects returned by the command. For
       example, a bank account has "balance", "coming" or "label" fields.

   The following operators are supported:
       =      Test if object.field is equal to the value.

       !=     Test if object.field is not equal to the value.

       >      Test if object.field is greater than the value. If object.field
              is date, return true if value is before that object.field.

       <      Test if object.field is less than the value. If object.field is
              date, return true if value is after that object.field.

       |      This operator is available only for string fields. It works like
              the Unix standard grep command, and returns True if the pattern
              specified in the value is in object.field.

   Expression combination
       You can make a expression combinations with the keywords " AND ", " OR
       " an " LIMIT ".

       The LIMIT keyword can be used to limit the number of items upon which
       running the expression. LIMIT can only be placed at the end of the
       expression followed by the number of elements you want.

   Examples:
       woob bank ls --condition 'label=Livret A'
       Display only the "Livret A" account.

       woob bank ls --condition 'balance>10000'
       Display accounts with a lot of money.

       woob bank history account@backend --condition 'label|rewe'
       Get transactions containing "rewe".

       woob bank history account@backend --condition 'date>2013-12-01 AND date<2013-12-09'
       Get transactions betweens the 2th December and 8th December 2013.

       woob bank history account@backend --condition 'date>2013-12-01 LIMIT 10'
       Get transactions after the 2th December in the last 10 transactions
