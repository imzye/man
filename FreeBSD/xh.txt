XH(1)                            User Commands                           XH(1)



NAME
       xh - Friendly and fast tool for sending HTTP requests


SYNOPSIS
       xh [OPTIONS] [METHOD] URL [--] [REQUEST_ITEM ...]


DESCRIPTION
       xh is an HTTP client with a friendly command line interface. It strives
       to have readable output and easy-to-use options.

       xh is mostly compatible with HTTPie: see http(1).

       The --curl option can be used to print a curl(1) translation of the
       command instead of sending a request.


POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       [METHOD]
           The HTTP method to use for the request.

           This defaults to GET, or to POST if the request contains a body.

       URL The URL to request.

           The URL scheme defaults to "http://" normally, or "https://" if the
           program is invoked as "xhs".

           A leading colon works as shorthand for localhost. ":8000" is
           equivalent to "localhost:8000", and ":/path" is equivalent to
           "localhost/path".

       [REQUEST_ITEM ...]
           Optional key-value pairs to be included in the request.

           The separator is used to determine the type:

               key==value
                   Add a query string to the URL.

               key=value
                   Add a JSON property (--json) or form field (--form) to the
                   request body.

               key:=value
                   Add a field with a literal JSON value to the request body.

                   Example: "numbers:=[1,2,3] enabled:=true"

               key@filename
                   Upload a file (requires --form or --multipart).

                   To set the filename and mimetype, ";type=" and ";filename="
                   can be used respectively.

                   Example: "pfp@ra.jpg;type=image/jpeg;filename=profile.jpg"

               @filename
                   Use a file as the request body.

               header:value
                   Add a header, e.g. "user-agent:foobar"

               header:
                   Unset a header, e.g. "connection:"

               header;
                   Add a header with an empty value.

           An "@" prefix can be used to read a value from a file. For example:
           "x-api-key:@api-key.txt".

           A backslash can be used to escape special characters, e.g.
           "weird\:key=value".

           To construct a complex JSON object, the REQUEST_ITEM's key can be
           set to a JSON path instead of a field name.  For more information
           on this syntax, refer to https://httpie.io/docs/cli/nested-json.


OPTIONS
       Each --OPTION can be reset with a --no-OPTION argument.

       -j, --json
           (default) Serialize data items from the command line as a JSON
           object.

           Overrides both --form and --multipart.

       -f, --form
           Serialize data items from the command line as form fields.

           Overrides both --json and --multipart.

       --multipart
           Like --form, but force a multipart/form-data request even without
           files.

           Overrides both --json and --form.

       --raw=RAW
           Pass raw request data without extra processing.

       --pretty=STYLE
           Controls output processing. Possible values are:

               all      (default) Enable both coloring and formatting
               colors   Apply syntax highlighting to output
               format   Pretty-print json and sort headers
               none     Disable both coloring and formatting

           Defaults to "format" if the NO_COLOR env is set and to "none" if
           stdout is not tty.

       --format-options=FORMAT_OPTIONS
           Set output formatting options. Supported option are:

               json.indent:<NUM>
               json.format:<true|false>
               headers.sort:<true|false>

           Example: --format-options=json.indent:2,headers.sort:false.

       -s, --style=THEME
           Output coloring style.

           [possible values: auto, solarized, monokai, fruity]

       --response-charset=ENCODING
           Override the response encoding for terminal display purposes.

           Example: --response-charset=latin1.

       --response-mime=MIME_TYPE
           Override the response mime type for coloring and formatting for the
           terminal.

           Example: --response-mime=application/json.

       -p, --print=FORMAT
           String specifying what the output should contain

               'H' request headers
               'B' request body
               'h' response headers
               'b' response body
               'm' response metadata

           Example: --print=Hb.

       -h, --headers
           Print only the response headers. Shortcut for --print=h.

       -b, --body
           Print only the response body. Shortcut for --print=b.

       -m, --meta
           Print only the response metadata. Shortcut for --print=m.

       -v, --verbose
           Print the whole request as well as the response.

           Additionally, this enables --all for printing intermediary
           requests/responses while following redirects.

           Using verbose twice i.e. -vv will print the response metadata as
           well.

           Equivalent to --print=HhBb --all.

       --debug
           Print full error stack traces and debug log messages.

           Logging can be configured in more detail using the `$RUST_LOG`
           environment variable. Set `RUST_LOG=trace` to show even more
           messages. See
           https://docs.rs/env_logger/0.11.3/env_logger/#enabling-logging.

       --all
           Show any intermediary requests/responses while following redirects
           with --follow.

       -P, --history-print=FORMAT
           The same as --print but applies only to intermediary
           requests/responses.

       -q, --quiet
           Do not print to stdout or stderr.

           Using quiet twice i.e. -qq will suppress warnings as well.

       -S, --stream
           Always stream the response body.

       -x, --compress
           Content compressed (encoded) with Deflate algorithm.

           The Content-Encoding header is set to deflate.

           Compression is skipped if it appears that compression ratio is
           negative. Compression can be forced by repeating this option.

           Note: Compression cannot be used if the Content-Encoding request
           header is present.

       -o, --output=FILE
           Save output to FILE instead of stdout.

       -d, --download
           Download the body to a file instead of printing it.

           The Accept-Encoding header is set to identify and any redirects
           will be followed.

       -c, --continue
           Resume an interrupted download. Requires --download and --output.

       --session=FILE
           Create, or reuse and update a session.

           Within a session, custom headers, auth credentials, as well as any
           cookies sent by the server persist between requests.

       --session-read-only=FILE
           Create or read a session without updating it form the
           request/response exchange.

       -A, --auth-type=AUTH_TYPE
           Specify the auth mechanism.

           [possible values: basic, bearer, digest]

       -a, --auth=USER[:PASS] | TOKEN
           Authenticate as USER with PASS (-A basic|digest) or with TOKEN (-A
           bearer).

           PASS will be prompted if missing. Use a trailing colon (i.e.
           "USER:") to authenticate with just a username.

           TOKEN is expected if --auth-type=bearer.

       --ignore-netrc
           Do not use credentials from .netrc.

       --offline
           Construct HTTP requests without sending them anywhere.

       --check-status
           (default) Exit with an error status code if the server replies with
           an error.

           The exit code will be 4 on 4xx (Client Error), 5 on 5xx (Server
           Error), or 3 on 3xx (Redirect) if --follow isn't set.

           If stdout is redirected then a warning is written to stderr.

       -F, --follow
           Do follow redirects.

       --max-redirects=NUM
           Number of redirects to follow. Only respected if --follow is used.

       --timeout=SEC
           Connection timeout of the request.

           The default value is "0", i.e., there is no timeout limit.

       --proxy=PROTOCOL:URL
           Use a proxy for a protocol. For example: --proxy
           https:http://proxy.host:8080.

           PROTOCOL can be "http", "https" or "all".

           If your proxy requires credentials, put them in the URL, like so:
           --proxy http:socks5://user:password@proxy.host:8000.

           You can specify proxies for multiple protocols by repeating this
           option.

           The environment variables "http_proxy" and "https_proxy" can also
           be used, but are completely ignored if --proxy is passed.

       --verify=VERIFY
           If "no", skip SSL verification. If a file path, use it as a CA
           bundle.

           Specifying a CA bundle will disable the system's built-in root
           certificates.

           "false" instead of "no" also works. The default is "yes" ("true").

       --cert=FILE
           Use a client side certificate for SSL.

       --cert-key=FILE
           A private key file to use with --cert.

           Only necessary if the private key is not contained in the cert
           file.

       --ssl=VERSION
           Force a particular TLS version.

           "auto" gives the default behavior of negotiating a version with the
           server.

           [possible values: auto, tls1, tls1.1, tls1.2, tls1.3]

       --native-tls
           Use the system TLS library instead of rustls (if enabled at compile
           time).

       --https
           Make HTTPS requests if not specified in the URL.

       --http-version=VERSION
           HTTP version to use.

           [possible values: 1.0, 1.1, 2, 2-prior-knowledge]

       --resolve=HOST:ADDRESS
           Override DNS resolution for specific domain to a custom IP.

           You can override multiple domains by repeating this option.

           Example: --resolve=example.com:127.0.0.1.

       --interface=NAME
           Bind to a network interface or local IP address.

           Example: --interface=eth0 --interface=192.168.0.2.

       -4, --ipv4
           Resolve hostname to ipv4 addresses only.

       -6, --ipv6
           Resolve hostname to ipv6 addresses only.

       -I, --ignore-stdin
           Do not attempt to read stdin.

           This disables the default behaviour of reading the request body
           from stdin when a redirected input is detected.

           It is recommended to pass this flag when using xh for scripting
           purposes. For more information, refer to
           https://httpie.io/docs/cli/best-practices.

       --curl
           Print a translation to a curl command.

           For translating the other way, try https://curl2httpie.online/.

       --curl-long
           Use the long versions of curl's flags.

       --generate=KIND
           Generate shell completions or man pages. Possible values are:

               complete-bash
               complete-elvish
               complete-fish
               complete-nushell
               complete-powershell
               complete-zsh
               man

           Example: xh --generate=complete-bash > xh.bash.

       --help
           Print help.

       -V, --version
           Print version.


EXIT STATUS
       0   Successful program execution.

       1   Usage, syntax or network error.

       2   Request timeout.

       3   Unexpected HTTP 3xx Redirection.

       4   HTTP 4xx Client Error.

       5   HTTP 5xx Server Error.

       6   Too many redirects.


ENVIRONMENT
       XH_CONFIG_DIR
           Specifies where to look for config.json and named session data.
           The default is ~/.config/xh for Linux/macOS and %APPDATA%\xh for
           Windows.

       XH_HTTPIE_COMPAT_MODE
           Enables the HTTPie Compatibility Mode. The only current difference
           is that --check-status is not enabled by default. An alternative to
           setting this environment variable is to rename the binary to either
           http or https.

       REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE, CURL_CA_BUNDLE
           Sets a custom CA bundle path.

       http_proxy=[protocol://]<host>[:port]
           Sets the proxy server to use for HTTP.

       HTTPS_PROXY=[protocol://]<host>[:port]
           Sets the proxy server to use for HTTPS.

       NO_PROXY
           List of comma-separated hosts for which to ignore the other proxy
           environment variables. "*" matches all host names.

       NETRC
           Location of the .netrc file.

       NO_COLOR
           Disables output coloring. See <https://no-color.org>

       RUST_LOG
           Configure low-level debug messages. See
           <https://docs.rs/env_logger/0.11.3/env_logger/#enabling-logging>


FILES
