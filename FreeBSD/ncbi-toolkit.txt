NAME
       Psequin - submit sequences to Genbank, EMBL, and DDBJ

SYNOPSIS
       Psequin [-b] [-bse] [-e] [-f filename] [-gc] [-h] [-oldaln] [-oldasn]
       [-oldgph] [-oldseq] [-oldsource] [-s] [-w] [-x]

DESCRIPTION
       Psequin is a program designed to aid in the submission of sequences to
       the GenBank, EMBL, and DDBJ sequence databases. It was written at the
       National Center for Biotechnology Information, part of the National
       Library of Medicine at the National Institutes of Health.

       Psequin can assemble the essential elements of a GenBank record from
       simple FASTA-format text files. For example, the program obtains the
       proper genetic code from an organism name, and automatically determines
       coding region intervals by back-translation from the protein sequence.
       An on-line help window scrolls to the appropriate place as the user
       moves between and within data entry forms, giving relevant details on
       what information is expected.

       Psequin also contains a number of built-in validation functions for
       quality assurance. Features such as splice sites and coding region
       translations are checked for accuracy or internal consistency. Double-
       clicking on an error message launches an appropriate editor by which
       the user can correct any problems.

       Psequin provides live, clickable views of the data in a variety of
       formats, including a report form, GenBank flatfile, EMBL flatfile, and
       a graphical view. Double clicking on an item in any of these formats
       launches an editor for that item. The editor is capable of maintaining
       correct feature table positions as the underlying sequence is edited.
       It can display features on the sequence during editing, and allows
       feature intervals to be adjusted by direct manipulation.
