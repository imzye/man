DateTime::Format::SQLite(3)                User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       DateTime::Format::SQLite - Parse and format SQLite dates and times

SYNOPSIS
         use DateTime::Format::SQLite;

         my $dt = DateTime::Format::SQLite->parse_datetime( '2003-01-16 23:12:01' );

         # 2003-01-16 23:12:01
         DateTime::Format::SQLite->format_datetime($dt);

DESCRIPTION
       This module understands the formats used by SQLite for its "date",
       "datetime" and "time" functions.  It can be used to parse these formats
       in order to create DateTime objects, and it can take a DateTime object
       and produce a timestring accepted by SQLite.

       NOTE: SQLite does not have real date/time types but stores everything
       as strings. This module deals with the date/time strings as
       understood/returned by SQLite's "date", "time", "datetime", "julianday"
       and "strftime" SQL functions.  You will usually want to store your
       dates in one of these formats.

METHODS
       This class offers the methods listed below.  All of the parsing methods
       set the returned DateTime object's time zone to the UTC zone because
       SQLite does always uses UTC for date calculations.  This means your
       dates may seem to be one day off if you convert them to local time.

       •   parse_datetime($string)

           Given a $string representing a date, this method will return a new
           "DateTime" object.

           The $string may be in any of the formats understood by SQLite's
           "date", "time", "datetime", "julianday" and "strftime" SQL
           functions or it may be in the format returned by these functions
           (except "strftime", of course).

           The time zone for this object will always be in UTC because SQLite
           assumes UTC for all date calculations.

           If $string contains no date, the parser assumes 2000-01-01 (just
           like SQLite).

           If given an improperly formatted string, this method may die.

       •   parse_date($string)

       •   parse_time($string)

       •   parse_julianday($string)

           These are aliases for "parse_datetime", for symmetry with
           "format_*" functions.

       •   format_date($datetime)

           Given a "DateTime" object, this methods returnes a string in the
           format YYYY-MM-DD, i.e. in the same format SQLite's "date" function
           uses.

       •   format_time($datetime)

           Given a "DateTime" object, this methods returnes a string in the
           format HH:MM:SS, i.e. in the same format SQLite's "time" function
           uses.

       •   format_datetime($datetime)

           Given a "DateTime" object, this methods returnes a string in the
           format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, i.e. in the same format SQLite's
           "datetime" function uses.

       •   format_julianday($datetime)

           Given a "DateTime" object, this methods returnes a string in the
           format DDDDDDDDDD, i.e. in the same format SQLite's "julianday"
           function uses.
