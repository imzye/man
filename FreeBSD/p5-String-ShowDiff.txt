NAME
       String::ShowDiff - Perl extension to help visualize differences between
       strings

SYNOPSIS
         use String::ShowDiff qw/ansi_colored_diff/;
         print ansi_colored_diff("abcehjlmnp", "bcdefjklmrst");

         # or a bit more detailed:
         my %options = ('u' => 'reset',
                        '+' => 'on_green',
                                '-' => 'on_red');
         print ansi_colored_diff($oldstring, $newstring, \%options);

         # or let's see only the changed words
         print ansi_colored_diff($old, $new, {context => qr/\w*/, gap => ' '});

DESCRIPTION
       This module is a wrapper around the diff algorithm from the module
       "Algorithm::Diff". It's job is to simplify a visualization of the
       differences of each strings.

       Compared to the many other Diff modules, the output is neither in
       "diff"-style nor are the recognised differences on line or word
       boundaries, they are at character level.

   FUNCTIONS
       ansi_colored_diff $string, $changed_string, $options_hash;
        This method compares $string with $changed_string and returns a string
        for an output on an ANSI terminal.  Removed characters from $string
        are shown by default with a red background, while added characters to
        $changed_string are shown by default with a green background (the
        unchanged characters are shown with the default values for the
        terminal).

        The $options_hash allows you to set the colors for the output and the
        context to be shown.  The variable is a reference to a hash with the
        optional keys: 'u' for the color of the unchanged parts, '-', '+' for
        the color of the removed and the added parts, 'context' for a regexp
        specifying the context that shall be shown before and after a changed
        part and 'gap' for the string that shall be shown between the contexts
        of two changings.  The default values for the options are:

            my $default_options = {
                'u'       => 'reset',
                '-'       => 'on_red',
                '+'       => 'on_green',
            'context' => qr/.*/,
            'gap'     => '',
            };

        The specified colors must follow the conventions for the "colored"
        method of Term::ANSIColor.  Please read its documentation for details.

        The specified context must be a valid regexp, constructed with the
        "qr/.../" operator (or alternatively a string defining a valid
        regexp).  Internal the context around a changing is created with
        matching the preceding substring with "/($context_re)$" and the
        succeeding substring with "^($context_re)". That is important to know
        if you want to work with backreferences. As an additional group
        encloses your regexp pattern, the first of your own defined subgroup
        is in $2 instead of $1. (That's not very nice, but still better than
        paying the price of using $&).

        The "gap" parameter describes how to fill the gap between two shown
        changings in their context. Here are some examples of these
        parameters:

            print ansi_colored_diff($s1, $s2, {context => qr/.*/, gap => ''}); # default
            # will print the complete combined string with the marked removings and
            # additions

            print ansi_colored_diff($s1, $s2, {context => qr/.{0,3}/, gap => ' ... '});
            # will print all changings with a context of the left and right 3 chars
            # and will join each of them with a space, 3 dots and a space
            # Note that it is important to use qr/.{0,3}/ instead of qr/.../ to also
            # show only a context of 0,1 or 2 chars at the beginning or end of the
            # strings

            print ansi_colored_diff($s1, $s2, {context => qr/\w*/, gap => ' '})
            # will print all changed words and seperates them with a blank

   EXPORT
       None by default.
