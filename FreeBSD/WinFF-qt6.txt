NAME
       winff - video and audio batch converter using ffmpeg or avconv

SYNOPSIS
       winff

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the winff command. This manual page
       was written for the Debian(TM) distribution because the original
       program does not have a manual page. Instead, it has documentation pdf
       format; see below.

       WinFF is a graphical user interface for the command line video
       converter ffmpeg or avconv. It runs ffmpeg or avconv from the command
       line. So, you just pick your files and it does the rest.

       WinFF doesn't actually convert any video files. It just runs ffmpeg or
       avconv. Therefore, It will convert any video file that ffmpeg or avconv
       will convert. Conversely, if ffmpeg or avconv will not convert the
       file, then WinFF will not either.

SEE ALSO
       For more details, you should have a look at the pdf manual, available
       at /usr/share/doc/winff/winff.pdf
