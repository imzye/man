BLUEMOON(6)                                                        BLUEMOON(6)

NAME
       bluemoon - the Blue Moon solitaire

SYNOPSIS
       bluemoon

DESCRIPTION
       This 52-card solitaire starts with the entire deck shuffled and dealt
       out in four rows.  The aces are then moved to the left end of the
       layout, making 4 initial free spaces.  You may move to a space only the
       card that matches the left neighbor in suit, and is one greater in
       rank.  Kings are high, so no cards may be placed to their right (they
       create dead spaces).

       When no moves can be made, cards still out of sequence are reshuffled
       and dealt face up after the ends of the partial sequences, leaving a
       card space after each sequence, so that each row looks like a partial
       sequence followed by a space, followed by enough cards to make a row of
       14.

       A moment’s reflection will show that this game cannot take more than 13
       deals. A good score is 1-3 deals, 4-7 is average, 8 or more is poor.
