NAME
       ncc - source code analysis

SYNOPSIS
       ncc file.c

DESCRIPTION
       ncc is a program that can help you hack/study the source code of C
       programs.  It will report which functions call which other functions,
       which functions are called by other functions and what global variables
       and members of structures are used by functions. This is useful if you
       want to analyse a program and eventually hack it.

USAGE
       To use ncc find the Makefile of the program you want to analyse. In the
       Makefile locate  the line which sets the C compiler. That is usually
       something like CC = gcc and you must change it to CC = ncc -ncgcc -ncld
       -ncfabs.  Then compile the application. It may be useful to also
       replace AR = ar with AR = nccar and LD = ld with LD = nccld to link
       nccout object files.

OUTPUT
       ncc will produce a file with nccout extension for every C file
       analysed.  Then you can use the viewer nccnav (with nccnav
       program.nccout ) to view this data and do your work.  If the procedure
       of make links object files with "ar" or "ld" you should manually link
       the produced .nccout files.
