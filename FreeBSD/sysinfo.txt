SYSINFO.CONF(5)           FreeBSD File Formats Manual          SYSINFO.CONF(5)

NAME
     /usr/local/etc/sysinfo.conf – sysinfo(8) configuration file

DESCRIPTION
     The /usr/local/etc/sysinfo.conf file is used to overwrite the default
     behavior of the sysinfo(8) utility.

     When sysinfo(8) is invoked, it loads the configuration from the
     /usr/local/etc/sysinfo.conf file and overwrites the default settings of
     the utility.

     The following configuration options can be set in
     /usr/local/etc/sysinfo.conf:

           PATH       Sets the environment variable PATH to make sure that the
                      required systems utilities will be found.  If any of the
                      systems utilities are located in a non-standard
                      location, this variable should be set to include it.

           APPDIR     Defines a directory relative to all the other
                      application files.

           MODPATH    Sets the path to the individual modules.

           ALLMODS    List of all available modules.  To add a new module to
                      the sysinfo(8), it is required to add it to this
                      variable in order to make it functional.  Note that the
                      module itself also has to be executable.

           COLORS     Set this to “YES” if the output generated by sysinfo(8)
                      should be colorful.  Otherwise set it to “NO”.

           INFO_MSGS  If the generated output may contain an additional
                      information, such as configuration hints and references
                      to useful manual pages, set this to “YES”, otherwise set
                      it to “NO”.

           DEBUG      The sysinfo(8) utility will generate debugging messages
                      if this variable is set to “YES”.  These messages may be
                      useful while working on new modules or enhancing
                      existing ones.  If set to “NO”, no debugging information
                      will be included in the generated output.

           VERBOSE    This variable sets the default value of the verbose
                      level.  The sysinfo(8) utility currently supports two
                      levels of verbose level, i.e 0 and 1.

EXAMPLES
     The following are the default values of /usr/local/etc/sysinfo.conf file.

           PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:${PATH}
           APPDIR=/usr/local/share/sysinfo
           MODPATH=${APPDIR}/modules
           ALLMODS="system bios cpu mem os storage network user packages services misc"
           COLORS="YES"
           INFO_MSGS="YES"
           DEBUG="NO"
           VERBOSE=0
