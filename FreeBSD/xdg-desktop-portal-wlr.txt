xdg-desktop-portal-wlr(5)                          FreeBSD File Formats Manual

NAME
       xdg-desktop-portal-wlr - an xdg-desktop-portal backend for wlroots

DESCRIPTION
       xdg-desktop-portal-wlr (or xdpw for short) allows applications to
       request screenshots and screencasts via xdg-desktop-portal in wlroots-
       based Wayland compositors.

       xdpw will try to load the configuration file from these locations:

       •   $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xdg-desktop-portal-wlr/$XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP
       •   $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xdg-desktop-portal-wlr/config
       •   /usr/local/etc/xdg/xdg-desktop-portal-wlr/$XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP
       •   /usr/local/etc/xdg/xdg-desktop-portal-wlr/config

       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to ~/.config. $XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP can be a
       colon separated list. Each element of that list will be tried.

       The configuration files use the INI file format. Example:

           [screencast]
           output_name=HDMI-A-1
           max_fps=30
           exec_before=disable_notifications.sh
           exec_after=enable_notifications.sh
           chooser_type=simple
           chooser_cmd=slurp -f %o -or

SCREENCAST OPTIONS
       These options need to be placed under the [screencast] section.

       output_name = name
           Select which output will be screencast.

           This option is used with chooser_type = none. The list of available
           outputs can be obtained via wayland-info(1) (under the wl_output
           section).

       max_fps = limit
           Limit the number of frames per second to the provided rate.

           This is useful to reduce CPU usage when capturing frames at the
           output's refresh rate is unnecessary.

       exec_before = command
           Execute command before starting a screencast. The command will be
           executed within sh.

       exec_after = command
           Execute command after ending all screencasts. The command will be
           executed within sh.

       chooser_cmd = command
           Run this command to select an output.

           For more details see OUTPUT CHOOSER.

       chooser_type = type
           Specifies the input send to the chooser.

           The supported types are:
           •   default: xdpw will try to use the first chooser found in the
               list of hardcoded choosers (slurp, wofi, bemenu) and will
               fallback to an arbitrary output if none of those were found.
           •   none: xdpw will allow screencast either on the output given by
               output_name, or if empty an arbitrary output without further
               interaction.
           •   simple, dmenu: xdpw will launch the chooser given by
               chooser_cmd. For more details see OUTPUT CHOOSER.

       force_mod_linear = bool
           Force buffers with implicit modifiers to be linear (experimental)

           Setting this option to 1 will force xdpw to allocate dma-bufs with
           implicit modifier as linear. This option shouldn't be required on
           single gpu setups, but can increase compatibility especially on
           setups with multiple gpus.

           This option is experimental and can be removed or replaced in
           future versions.

   OUTPUT CHOOSER
       The chooser can be any program or script with the following behaviour:
       •   It returns any error code except 127. The error code 127 is
           internally used to signal that no command could be found and all
           output from it will be ignored.
       •   It returns the name of a valid output on stdout as given by
           wayland-info(1). Everything else will be handled as declined by the
           user.
       •   To signal that the user has declined screencast, the chooser should
           exit without anything on stdout.

       Supported types of choosers via the chooser_type option:
       •   simple: the chooser is just called without anything further on
           stdin.
       •   dmenu: the chooser receives a newline separated list (dmenu style)
           of outputs on stdin.
