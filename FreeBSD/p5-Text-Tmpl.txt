NAME
       template_syntax - description of the syntax of a Text::Tmpl template.

SYNOPSIS
       In general:

       <!--#function "argument1", $argument2, "argu" $ment
       "3"--><!--#endfunction-->

       Specifically:

       <!--#echo "text"-->

       <!--#include "file"-->

       <!--#comment-->This won't be printed<!--#endcomment-->

       <!--#if "value"-->This will be printed if "value" is
       "true"<!--#endif-->

       <!--#ifn "value"-->This will be printed if "value" is
       "false"<!--#endifn-->

       <!--#loop "loopname"-->This may be printed a bunch of
       times<!--#endloop-->

       <!--#debug--><!--#include "debug-include.tmpl"--><!--#enddebug-->

       debug-include.tmpl:

       Variables in this context: <!--#loop "variables-" $number-->

       <!--#echo $variable_name--> == <!--#echo $variable_value-->

       <!--#endloop-->

       Named children (loops) in this context: <!--#loop "named_children-"
       $number-->

       <!--#loop $nc_name--> <!--#echo $nc_name-->: <!--#include
       "debug-include.tmpl"--> <!--#endloop-->

       <!--#endloop-->

DESCRIPTION
       The specific tags listed above are merely the default tags in the
       template library.  It is possible to add tags of your own.

       The tag format is: open_tag_delimiter (default: "<!--#") + function
       name + some whitespace + comma-separated argument list (described
       below) + close_tag_delimiter (default: "-->").

       Each argument in the comma-separated argument list consists of
       variables and strings - everything else is ignored.  A variable looks
       like $foo, where foo is any number of alphanumeric characters.  A
       string is anything (including whitespace, newlines, etc...) within
       double-quotes.  To put literal double quotes into a string, escape with
       a backslash.  For example, the following list:

       "argument1", $argument2, "argu" $ment "3"

       would become:

       argument1, (the value of $argument2), argu(the value of $ment)3

       Tag pair nesting is possible (and infinite, at least if you have an
       infinite stack...)  Also, the result of a simple tag evaluation will
       actually be parsed again, so you can (for example) include another
       template into the current one, and it will be parsed.

       echo
          The echo tag is replaced by the concatenated string values of each
          of its arguments.

       include
          The include tag is replaced by the contents of the named file.

       comment / endcomment
          The comment/endcomment tag pair, and everything it contains, is
          replaced by nothing.

       if / endif
          The if/endif tag pair, and everything it contains, is replaced by
          nothing or by the complete contents of the tag pair, depending on
          the "truth" of the first argument to the tag.  If the argument is
          true, the complete contents of the tag pair are output - otherwise,
          nothing is output.

       ifn / endifn
          The ifn/endifn tag pair, and everything it contains, is replaced by
          nothing or by the complete contents of the tag pair, depending on
          the "truth" of the first argument to the tag.  If the argument is
          false, the complete contents of the tag pair are output - otherwise,
          nothing is output.

       loop / endloop
          The loop/endloop tag pair is replaced by everything it contains,
          repeated 0 or more times.  The first argument to the loop tag is the
          name of the loop, and the number of repetitions is equal to the
          number of times that loop_iteration() was called in the current
          context with that loop name as an argument.

       debug / enddebug
          The debug/enddebug tag pair is replaced by everything it contains.
          This pair also dumps all of the information about the parent context
          into this sub-context, so that you can see the internal state of the
          context as output.  The format for using the debug/enddebug tag pair
          is shown in the SYNOPSIS above.

BUGS
       Hopefully none.
