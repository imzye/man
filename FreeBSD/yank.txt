YANK(1)                 FreeBSD General Commands Manual                YANK(1)

NAME
     yank – yank terminal output to clipboard

SYNOPSIS
     yank [-1ilxv] [-d delim] [-g pattern] [-- command [argument ...]]

DESCRIPTION
     Read input from stdin and display a selection interface that allows a
     field to be selected and copied to the clipboard.  Fields are either
     recognized by a regular expression using the -g option or by splitting
     the input on a delimiter sequence using the -d option, see DELIMITERS.

     Using the arrow keys will move the selected field, see COMMANDS.
     Pressing the return key will invoke command and write the selected field
     to its stdin.  The command defaults to xsel(1x) but could be anything
     that accepts input on stdin, see EXAMPLES.

     The options are as follows:

     -1      If only one field is recognized, select it and invoke command
             without displaying the selection interface.

     -d delim
             All input characters not present in delim will be recognized as
             fields, see DELIMITERS.

     -g pattern
             Use pattern to recognize fields, expressed as a POSIX extended
             regular expression.

     -i      Ignore case differences between pattern and the input.

     -l      Use the default delimiters except for space, see DELIMITERS.

     -v      Prints version.

     -x      Use alternate screen.

     -- command [argument ...]
             Use command with zero or more args as the yank command.

COMMANDS
     Ctrl-A | g
           Move selection to the first field.

     Ctrl-C | Ctrl-D
           Exit without invoking the yank command.

     Ctrl-E | G
           Move selection to the last field.

     Ctrl-P/Ctrl-N | Left/Right | h/l
           Move selection to the left or right.

     Up/Down | j/k
           Move selection to the next or previous line.

     Enter
           Exit using the selected field.

DELIMITERS
     If the -d and -g options are omitted the following characters are
     recognized as delimiters by default:

     \f    form feed

     \n    new line

     \r    carriage return

     \s    space

     \t    horizontal tab

     If the -d option is present space is not recognized as a delimiter.

EXAMPLES
     Yank an environment variable key or value:

           $ env | yank -d =

     Yank a field from a CSV file:

           $ yank -d \", <file.csv

     Yank a whole line using the -l option:

           $ make 2>&1 | yank -l

     If stdout is not a terminal the selected field will be written to stdout
     and exit without invoking the yank command.  Kill the selected PID:

           $ ps ux | yank -g [0-9]+ | xargs kill

     Yank the selected field to the clipboard as opposed of the default
     primary clipboard:

           $ yank — xsel -b

DIAGNOSTICS
     The yank utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

CAVEATS
     Recognizing fields enclosed in brackets requires ‘]’ to be present before
     ‘[’ in the argument given to the -d option, see re_format(7).
