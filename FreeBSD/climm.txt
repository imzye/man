DESCRIPTION
       climm is a text based ICQ client supporting many of the ICQ features
       provided by the client by Mirabilis. climm allows to change the user
       password, create new accounts, updating user info, search other users,
       send SMS, open direct connections, send acknowledged messages, transfer
       files, detect other user's client, send UTF-8 encoded messages, execute
       arbitrary commands upon any event, etc.

       -b|--basedir_<basedir>
              Specify basedir as the base directory where climm will look for
              its files, in particular its climmrc file.

       -i|--i18n_<locale>
              Use the locale locale instead of the one derived from
              environment variables.

       -v|--verbose[level]
              Set verbose mode, or set verbosity to level.

       -l|--logplace_<file>|<dir>
              Use file as file to write log into, or use dir as a directory to
              create per user log files in.

       -u|--uin_<uin>
              Login with uin only. Maybe repeated.

       -p|--passwd_<passwd>
              Login with passwd as password. Maybe repeated for each -u
              switch, or single.

       -s|--status_<status>
              Login with status as status, which may be given numerically or

       -C|--cmd_<commands>
              Execute climm commands cmds after login instead of the default
              eg command.

USAGE
       Upon first start (for the given base directory), climm will ask for a
       UIN, or create a new one. After the first login, the server based
       contact list will be imported automatically.
       Basic commands include msg to message other contacts (try pressing the
       <tab> key several times on an empty input line to bring up msg commands
       to message contacts recently talked to), add to add new contacts,
       update, other, and about to change your meta data on the ICQ server,
       and, of course, help for online help. A complete list of commands is
       available in the climmcmds(7) man page.

FEATURES
       climm is very portable and runs on Linux, DOS, OS/2, Win32, BeOS,
       AmigaOS, GNU HURD and any other modern unix system.  climm version 0.5
       is known to run on Linux, AIX, HPUX, Tru64, AmigaOS, partially BeOS and
       other unices.  However, the other ports may or may not still work and
       anyone wishing to test them is welcome to.
