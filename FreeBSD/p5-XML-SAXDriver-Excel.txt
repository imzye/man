NAME
         XML::SAXDriver::Excel - SAXDriver for converting Excel files to XML

SYNOPSIS
           use XML::SAXDriver::Excel;
           my $driver = XML::SAXDriver::Excel->new(%attr);
           $driver->parse(%attr);

DESCRIPTION
         XML::SAXDriver::Excel was developed as a complement to
         XML::Excel, though it provides a SAX interface, for
         gained performance and efficiency, to Excel files.
         Specific object attributes and handlers are set to
         define the behavior of the parse() method.  It does
         not matter where you define your attributes.  If they
         are defined in the new() method, they will apply to
         all parse() calls.  You can override in any call to
         parse() and it will remain local to that function call
         and not effect the rest of the object.

XML::SAXDriver::Excel properties
         Source - (Reference to a String, ByteStream, SystemId)

           String - **currently not supported** Contains literal Excel data.
                    Ex (Source => {String => $foo})

           ByteStream - **currently not supported** Contains a filehandle reference.
                        Ex. (Source => {ByteStream => \*STDIN})

           SystemId - Contains the path to the file containing
                      the Excel  data. Ex (Source => {SystemId => '../excel/foo.xls'})


         Handler - Contains the object to be used as a XML print handler

         DTDHandler - Contains the object to be used as a XML DTD handler.
                      ****There is no DTD support available at this time.
                      I'll make it available in the next version.****

         SubChar - Specifies the character(s) to use to substitute illegal chars in xml tag names, that
                   will be generated from the first row, but setting the Dynamic_Col_Headings.

         Col_Headings - Reference to the array of column names to be used for XML tag names.

         Dynamic_Col_Headings - Should be set if you want the XML tag names generated dynamically
                                from the first row in Excel file.  **Make sure that the number of columns
                                in your first row is equal to the largest row in the document.  You
                                don't generally have to worry about if you are submitting valid Excel
                                data, where each row will have the same number of columns, even if
                                they are empty.

         Headings_Handler - Should be used along with Dynamic_Col_Headings to provide a heading
                            normalization handler, to conform the headings to the XML 1.0
                            specifications.  If not provided, a default will be used that only
                            works with ASCII chars, therefore any other character sets need to
                            provide a custom handler!  The handler sub will be passed the heading
                            string as the first argument.
