DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the autozen, seq2wav,and zentime
       commands.  Full documentation is available at
       http://www.linuxlabs.com/autozen.html or /usr/share/doc/AutoZen in HTML
       format.

       AutoZen is a software 'brain machine' for Linux. It generates sounds
       and colors that are meant to cause the brain to temporarily shift to a
       different dominant frequency and cause the user to experience an
       altered state of consciousness. It is similar to the devices seen in
       the 'Sharper Image' catalog and in magazine ads, but the price is a lot
       more attractive!

       autozen
              interactively generates color and sound to cause your brain to
              operate at a chosen target frequency.  It may also "play" a
              sequence file directly to the sound card (with accompanying
              colorbox).

       seq2wav
              generates a wav file ready for burning to audio cd from an
              autozen sequence file.
              NOTE: most (but not all) cd players will play these CDs.
              Successful CD mastering is left as an exercise for the reader.

       zentime
              examimes a sequence file and outputs the total time for the
              sequence

OPTIONS
       -h     Show summary of options.

       -colorbox [<x> <y>]
              In addition to sound, create a colorbox window with a flashing
              red/green background.  If <x> and <y> are supplied, make the
              window that size in pixels.

       -harmonics <n>
              Generated sound should contain <n> harmonics (counting the
              fundamental). Default is 3.

       sequence
              is a simple text based control file for AutoZen (see full
              documentation for details).

       This man page could use improvement.
