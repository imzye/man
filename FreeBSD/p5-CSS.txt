NAME
       CSS - Object oriented access to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

SYNOPSIS
         use CSS;

         # create a CSS object with the default options
         my $css = CSS->new();

         # create a CSS object with a specific parser
         my $css = CSS->new( { 'parser' => 'CSS::Parse::Lite' } );
         my $css = CSS->new( { 'parser' => 'CSS::Parse::Heavy' } );
         my $css = CSS->new( { 'parser' => 'CSS::Parse::Compiled' } );

         # create a CSS object with a specific adaptor
         my $css = CSS->new( { 'adaptor' => 'CSS::Adaptor' } );
         my $css = CSS->new( { 'adaptor' => 'CSS::Adaptor::Pretty' } );
         my $css = CSS->new( { 'adaptor' => 'CSS::Adaptor::Debug' } );



         # parse some CSS from a string
         $css->read_string( $css_data );
         $css->read_string( ( $css_data, $more_css_data ) );

         # parse some CSS from a file
         $css->read_file( 'my_file.css' );
         $css->read_file( ( 'my_file.css', 'my_other_file.css' ) );



         # output the CSS using the current adaptor
         print $css->output();

         # set a new adaptor and then output the CSS
         $css->set_adaptor( 'CSS::Adaptor::Foo' );
         print $css->output();

         # output the CSS using a tempory adaptor
         print $css->output( 'CSS::Adaptor::Bar' );



         # forget about the CSS we've already parsed
         $css->purge();

DESCRIPTION
       This module can be used, along with a CSS::Parse::* module, to parse
       CSS data and represent it as a tree of objects. Using a CSS::Adaptor::*
       module, the CSS data tree can then be transformed into other formats.

NOTICE
       From version 1.00 of this module onwards, backwards compatibility is
       broken. This is due to large changes in the way data is parsed and then
       represented internally. Version 0.08 is still available on CPAN:
       <http://search.cpan.org/author/IAMCAL/CSS-0.08/>

TREE STRUCTURE
       The CSS object is the head of the tree. It contains a list of
       CSS::Style objects which each represent a CSS ruleset. Each of these
       objects contains a list of selectors and properties. Each selector is
       stored as a CSS::Selector object. Each property object is stored as a
       CSS::Property object and contains a list of values. These values are
       stored as CSS::Value objects.

         foo, bar {
             baz: fop;
             woo: yay houpla;
         }

       The above example would be represented as a single CSS::Style object.
       That object would then have two CSS::Selector objects representing
       'foo' and 'bar'. It would also have two CSS::Property objects
       representing 'baz' and 'woo'. The 'baz' object then has a single child
       CSS::Value object for 'fop', whilst the 'woo' object has two child
       objects for 'yay' and 'houpla'.

METHODS
   CONSTRUCTOR
       new() or "new( { ..options.. } )"
           An optional hash can contain arguments:

             parser        module to use as the CSS parser
             adaptor       adaptor to use for output

   ACCESSORS
       read_file( $filename ) or read_file( @filenames )
           Read one or mores files and parse the CSS within them.

       read_string( $scalar ) or read_string( @strings )
           Read one or more strings and parse the CSS within them.

       output() or output( 'CSS::Adaptor::Foo' )
           Return a string representation of the CSS tree, using either the
           current adaptor or the specified one.

       set_adaptor( 'CSS::Adaptor::Bar' )
           Set the current adaptor for the CSS tree.

       purge()
           Forget all the objects in the CSS tree;

       get_style_by_selector( 'selector_name' )
           Returns the first CSS::Style object with the specified selector
           name attached. Returns zero on failure.
