NAME
     wifibox-alpine – wifibox based on Alpine Linux

INTRODUCTION
     The implementation of the wifibox(8) embedded wireless router is based on
     the use of a Linux-based guest operating system which can communicate
     with the host's wireless network card on behalf of the host.  In order to
     meet the requirements of this setup, this has to be a system with a low
     resource footprint and easy to manage.

     This solution is derived from Alpine Linux, which is an actively
     maintained, security-oriented, lightweight distribution, based on musl
     libc and busybox.  For more information and introduction to the tools

IMPLEMENTATION
     The guest is created with a root user, which is associated with a blank
     password.  This can only be used to login to the guest via the console
     command of wifibox(8), no other services are configured for remote
     access.

     Although the root user possesses unlimited access to every resource
     inside the guest, files might not be changed in every case.  That is
     because the operating system is built in a way that it does not require
     any write access to the contents of the root file system.  In addition to
     that, all the contents of the disk image is stored in a compressed format
     via SquashFS and uncompressed to memory only on demand.  Everything that
     needs to be modified during the guest's run time is stored on dedicated
     file systems that are either memory-backed or shared with the host.

     The image can host either wpa_supplicant for connecting to wireless
     networks, or hostapd for creating wireless access points, depending how
     it was built.  In addition to that, a combination of dhcpcd and radvd
     could be used to support IPv6 traffic, mDNSResponder could be deployed to
     handle multicast DNS requests, and forwarding could be configured to pass
     traffic between originally isolated inner and outer networks, such as UDP
     broadcasts.  For packet analysis, tcpdump is provided as an optional
     component.  Each application-specific detail is going to be included
     below.

SHARED CONFIGURATION FILES
     For ease of management, the host shares configuration files with the
     services that are responsible for implementing the domain logic.  On the
     host, all the files are stored under /usr/local/etc/wifibox with
     additional subdirectories inside.

     The appliance subdirectory holds the generic configuration files.  On the
     guest, they are visible on the /media/etc directory where the config 9P
     (VirtFS) share is mounted in read-only mode.

     •   forwarding works with the appliance/forwarding.conf file.  It uses
         the syntax of the socat address specifications but it is limited to
         work with UDP and TCP ports only.  Note that this is an optional
         component, and its presence depends on the configuration of the guest
         image.  The respective configuration file on the guest is
         /media/etc/forwarding.conf, which is used directly from this
         location.

     •   hostname sets the hostname on boot from the applicance/hostname file.
         This is the name that is going to be visible for others on the local
         network.  Changing the hostname requires updating this file and
         restarting the guest.  The configuration file shows up on the guest
         as /media/etc/hostname, which is mapped to /etc/hostname, and used
         verbatim.

     •   ifup and ifdown work with the appliance/interfaces.conf file to
         associate the internal network interfaces with IP addresses: wlan0 is
         the wireless device and eth0 is the virtual Ethernet device towards
         the host which are both configured according to the contents of the
         configuration file.  On the guest, this is
         /media/etc/interfaces.conf, which is directly included as part of
         /etc/network/interfaces.

     •   iptables works with the appliance/iptables file and it is responsible
         for moving network packets (Network Address Translation, NAT) between
         the eth0 and wlan0 interfaces.  The configuration file describes the
         flow of the network packets through the interfaces.  Using
         /media/etc/iptables directly, it is loaded once at launching the
         respective service, usually on boot, and cannot be modified from the
         guest.

     •   ip6tables is the IPv6-enabled version of iptables which uses the
         appliance/ip6tables configuration file.  Its purpose is exactly the
         same as for its sibling, it bridges the eth0 and wlan0 networking
         interfaces with the help of NAT.  On the guest, /media/etc/ip6tables
         is used directly in this case.

     •   mDNSResponder works with the appliance/mdnsd-services.conf file and
         it can handle multicast DNS query packets on UDP port 5353.  The
         advertised services can be described by its configuration file so
         that others on the network could see them.  Note that this is
         optional component, and its presence depends on the configuration
         options of the guest image.  On the guest, the
         /media/etc/mdnsd-services.conf configuration file is used directly.

     •   udhcpd works with the appliance/udhcpd.conf file and it can implement
         a DHCP server for either eth0 or wlan0 so that it can hand out IP
         addresses in a given range for the host (wpa_supplicant) or the
         clients on the wireless network (hostapd), and can set itself the
         default gateway for forwarding the network traffic.  It also manages
         the distribution of information about the name servers, in
         cooperation with udhcpc (DHCP client) when required.  This is
         utilized only when dynamic IP addresses are in use.  On the guest,
         the configuration file becomes /media/etc/udhcpd.conf, which is used
         to generate /etc/udhcpd.conf that udhcpd will eventually read.

     •   dhcpcd is an alternative to udhcpc and it is used only when IPv6 is
         optionally configured.  In that case, it takes over the role of
         udhcpc and manages both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.  It works with the
         appliance/dhcpcd.conf file which often holds only a handful of
         overrides for the default options because otherwise they work well.
         dhcpcd is pre-configured to automatically keep udhcpd updated about
         name servers and it is employed only for wpa_supplicant.  The
         corresponding file on the guest is /media/etc/dhcpcd.conf, which is
         mapped to /etc/dhcpcd.conf.

     •   radvd works with the appliance/radvd.conf configuration file and this
         is the IPv6 Routing Advertisement Daemon that implements the routing
         functionality in case IPv6 is enabled.  It sends Router Advertisement
         messages, specified by RFC 2461, towards the host (wpa_supplicant) or
         the clients (hostapd), and sending a Router Solicitation message when
         requested.  These messages are required for IPv6 stateless
         autoconfiguration (SLAAC).  The corresponding configuration file on
         the guest is /media/etc/radvd.conf, which is mapped to
         /etc/radvd.conf.

     •   uds_passthru is an optional service for managing the forwarding of
         control sockets created for either wpa_supplicant or hostapd.  It
         works with the appliance/uds_passthru.conf file, which is optional,
         and when it is present, it automatically implies that the service is
         enabled.  The contents describe what sockets should be exposed over
         configured TCP ports with the help of socat, which a heavily
         stripped-down version of the original tool to minimize the related
         security risks.  On the guest, the path of the configuration file is
         /media/etc/uds_passthru.conf, from where it is used.

     Depending on the configuration, either the wpa_supplicant or hostapd
     subdirectory holds the configuration files that are used by either
     wpa_supplicant or hostapd, respectively.  On the guest, they are
     published under the paths /etc/wpa_supplicant and /etc/hostapd where the
     app_config 9P (VirtFS) share is mounted as read-write.  This will let
     wpa_supplicant or hostapd change the contents when instructed to do so
     from the host through the forwarded control sockets and permitted by the
     configuration.

     wpa_supplicant works with the wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf file,
     while hostapd works with the hostapd/hostapd.conf file.  These are the
     same tools that are used in the FreeBSD base system for the same purpose,
     and their Linux version is utilized here to make it possible to reuse the
     configuration files of the same format from the host.

     The variable data files under the guest's /var directory are shared with
     the host by mounting the var 9P (VirtFS) share there.  This includes
     streaming out all the logs under the /var/log directory, such as
     /var/log/dmesg or /var/log/messages so that the internal state of the
     guest can be tracked by accessing these files on the host per the
     configuration of wifibox.  The contents of the /var/run directory will
     not be visible on the host, as it is stored only in the memory.

INTERNALS
     Further components of the guest that are not directly configurable or
     visible to the outside:

     •   Version 6.12 (LTS) of the Linux kernel and its wireless drivers are
         used to communicate with exposed hardware.  It does not always work
         with the latest ones, see the section on supported hardware for the
         exact details.  Alternatively, it is possible to configure the image
         to have Linux 6.13 (stable) which could be suitable for testing
         experimental features and drivers.

     •   busybox is a combination of tiny versions of the common UNIX
         utilities, including the ash shell itself, shipped in a single small
         executable.  It provides the execution environment for all the
         scripts and services.  All the irrelevant modules were removed for
         security hardening.

     •   The base layout of the Alpine system is stripped down to the bare
         minimum, and for example, the guest does not have the apk package
         manager installed since it would not be able to work.  Instead, the
         disk image itself should be constructed in a way that it includes all
         the needed applications.

STARTING, STOPPING, AND RESTARTING SERVICES
     Every service running on the guest can be managed by the rc-service
     (locate and run OpenRC service) command, which is going to be used in
     this section.  The list of actively managed services can be learned as
     follows.

           # rc-service --list

     The status of a specific service can be queried by the status command.
     For example, the wpa_supplicant tool has its own associated service and
     it can be checked by the following command.

           # rc-service wpa_supplicant status

     Similarly to this, the start, stop, and restart commands are available as
     well to start, stop, or restart the given service, respectively.  In the
     example below, consider re-initializing all the network interfaces by
     restarting the networking service.

           # rc-service networking restart

     These commands can help with troubleshooting and restoring the respective
     services in case of failures.

CONFIGURATION OF NETWORK PACKET FILTERING
     The network packet filtering rules are managed by the iptables and
     ip6tables services, which need to be restarted so that the changes in
     either the iptables or the ip6tables file can take effect.  For example,
     in case of iptables:

           # rc-service iptables restart

     The active set of rules can be queried by the following command.

           # iptables -L -n

     Rules can be dynamically added, deleted, inserted, replaced, and flushed
     through the corresponding commands of the iptables utility, see its
     documentation for the details.  The current state of the configuration
     can be recorded by dumping it to temporary file under a directory which
     is shared with the host, that is /var/tmp in this case.

           # iptables-save > /var/tmp/iptables

     The file exported this way could be then used as the main configuration
     by moving it under the /usr/local/etc/wifibox/appliance directory on the
     host, as discussed above.

     The same set of commands apply for ip6tables, where iptables-save has to
     be written as ip6tables-save.

TROUBLESHOOTING NETWORK ISSUES
     To verify the flow of network traffic, the iptables or the ip6tables (for
     IPv6) utility can be asked to list the rules in a more verbose manner.
     This will include the number of packets that matched each of the rules,
     so their effect becomes observable.  For example, in case of iptables:

           # iptables -L -nv

     For finding the right configuration parameters for the rules of network
     packet filtering, it is possible to additionally install the tcpdump
     utility.  It can be used to capture all the packets that are flowing
     through all the networking interfaces and determine the proper IP
     addresses and ports.  When invoked without any parameters, it will start
     dumping all the traffic-related information to the standard output.  For
     all the features and options, please consult the documentation.

           # tcpdump

     Mind that this facility is not available by default, the guest image has
     to be explicitly configured to include this as it is a security risk.
     For the same reason, its removal is recommended once the analysis is
     concluded.

DEALING WITH UDP PACKETS
     By design, UDP packets are not meant to passed between the eth0 and wlan0
     interfaces which may cause certain applications to fail to work.  A
     possible way to address this shortcoming is to deploy the proper handlers
     to the user space and configure iptables to use them.  This can be
     requested by the RETURN target, which can be inserted in the PREROUTING
     chain for the NAT rules.  For example, in case of mDNSResponder, the
     packet filtering rules have to explicitly be configured to pass every UDP
     packet on port 5353 to the application for further processing.

           -A PREROUTING -p udp --dport 5353 -j RETURN

     For other similar uses, the forwarding service can be set up and the
     ports that are forwarded that way could be linked to the network packet
     filtering logic in the same manner.

WIRELESS DIAGNOSTICS
     Details of wireless configuration can be learned through the use of the
     iw tool, which is suitable for showing and manipulating wireless devices
     and their configuration.  For example, it can list the device
     capabilities, such as band information (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz), and 802.11n
     information.

           # iw list

     Scanning can be initiated as follows.  There, wlan0 is the name of the
     wireless networking device, which can be considered constant.

           # iw dev wlan0 scan

     Wireless events can be traced with the event command.  In the related
     example below, the -f and -t flags are added to show full frames for
     auth/assoc/deauth/disassoc as well as the timestamps for each event.

           # iw event -t -f

     To determine if there is an active connection to an Access Point and
     further related information can be displayed by the link command.

           # iw dev wlan0 link

     More details can be collected by the station dump command.

           # iw dev wlan0 station dump

BLOCKED WIRELESS DEVICES
     Sometimes it happens that even if the driver has successfully detected
     the wireless device, it is not yet ready to be used.  That is because the
     use of the device might be blocked either by software or hardware means
     i.e., by a physical switch.  The image contains the rfkill tool as part
     of BusyBox to unblock the wireless device.  Use the list command to see
     if rfkill is usable and list the available interfaces.

           # rfkill list

     If the interface is shown to be blocked, use the unblock command to
     unblock it.  This can be done either by function or index.

           # rfkill unblock wlan

     Or:

           # rfkill unblock 0

     Note that “hard” block status cannot be changed this way, as it is
     typically performed by the hardware switch or it is implemented by the
     firmware itself.  For example, the computer might be configured to turn
     off the wireless device when the wired networking interface card is
     active and the LAN cable is inserted.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
     There are a number of Linux drivers available as kernel modules.  Note
     that not all of them could be used immediately because there might be
     additional, often proprietary firmware files have to be placed under
     /lib/firmware for activation.

     A list of wireless cards supported by the drivers is as follows.  The
     kernel modules that depend on specific firmware files are marked by name
     at the end of each entry, otherwise they should be working.  The
     availability of those auxiliary files is a function of how the
     corresponding FreeBSD port is configured.  Some of them might be included
     for certain package flavors only or disabled by default and has to be
     explicitly configured and built by the user due to licensing
     restrictions.  Note that this list might not be accurate and included
     here for information only.

CAVEATS
     Certain vendors may assign different PCI IDs for their rebranded products
     even if they ship exactly the same chipset.  For example, AMD RZ608 is
     technically the same as MediaTek MT7921, but its PCI ID had to be
     explictly added for the corresponding driver to make it work.  Similar
     situations may occur any time, please let us know if this happens.
