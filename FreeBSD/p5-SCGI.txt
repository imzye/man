NAME
       SCGI

DESCRIPTION
       This module is for implementing an SCGI interface for an application
       server.

SYNOPISIS
         use SCGI;
         use IO::Socket;

         my $socket = IO::Socket::INET->new(Listen => 5, ReuseAddr => 1, LocalPort => 8080)
           or die "cannot bind to port 8080: $!";

         my $scgi = SCGI->new($socket, blocking => 1);

         while (my $request = $scgi->accept) {
           $request->read_env;
           read $request->connection, my $body, $request->env->{CONTENT_LENGTH};
           #
           print $request->connection "Content-Type: text/plain\n\nHello!\n";
         }

   public methods
       new Takes a socket followed by a set of options (key value pairs) and
           returns a new SCGI listener. Currently the only supported option is
           blocking, to indicate that the socket blocks and that the library
           should not treat it accordingly. By default blocking is false.
           (NOTE: blocking is now a named rather than positional parameter.
           Using as a positional parameter will produce a warning in this
           version and will throw an exception in the next version).

       accept
           Accepts a connection from the socket and returns an "SCGI::Request"
           for it.

       socket
           Returns the socket that was passed to the constructor.

       blocking
           Returns true if it was indicated that the socket should be blocking
           when the SCGI object was created.

KNOWN ISSUES
       The SCGI Apache2 module had a bug (for me at least), which resulted in
       segmentation faults. This appeared after version 1.2 (the version in
       Debian Sarge) and was fixed in 1.10.

       The SCGI Apache2 module has a bug where certain headers can be
       repeated. This is still present in version 1.10. A patch has been
       accepted and this issue should be resolved in the next release. This
       modulenow issues a warning on a repeated header, rather than throwing
       an exception as in the previous version.
