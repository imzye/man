Number::WithError::LaTeX(3)                User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Number::WithError::LaTeX - LaTeX output for Number::WithError

SYNOPSIS
         use Number::WithError::LaTeX;

         my $num = Number::WithError::LaTeX->new(5.647, 0.31);
         print $num . "\n";
         # prints '5.65e+00 +/- 3.1e-01'
         # (I.e. it automatically does scientific rounding)

         print $num->latex() . "\n";
         # prints '5.65 \cdot 10^{0} \pm 3.1 \cdot 10^{-1}'

         print $num->latex(radix => ',', enclose => '$') . "\n";
         # prints '$5,\!65 \cdot 10^{0} \pm 3,\!1 \cdot 10^{-1}$'

         print $num->encode("This will encode an e-acute (".chr(0xe9).") as \\'e") . "\n";
         # Delegated to TeX::Encode::encode().
         # prints 'This is a German umlaut: \"a'

DESCRIPTION
       This class is a subclass of Number::WithError. It provides the same
       interface and the same exports.

       It adds several methods to every object. The main functionality is
       provided by latex(), which dumps the object as valid LaTeX code. Also,
       encode() is a convenient way to encode any UTF-8 string into TeX. It is
       just a convenience thing since it is delegated to TeX::Encode.

       Unlike "Number::WithError", this module requires perl version 5.8 or
       later.  (That is the rationale for creating a separate distribution,
       too.)

EXPORT
       This module exports the following subroutines on demand. It supports
       the ":all" Exporter tag to export all of them. The subroutines are
       documented in Number::WithError.

   witherror
   witherror_big

METHODS
       This is a list of public methods.

   latex
       This method stringifies the object as valid LaTeX code. The returned
       string is valid in a LaTeX math mode. That means, you will have to
       enclose it in dollars or in an "equation" environment by default.

       The method takes named parameters. All parameters are optional.

       The "enclose" parameter can set a string to enclose the produced latex
       code in. This can be either a simple string like "$" or an array
       reference containing two strings. Those two strings will be used for
       the start and end respectively. (For environments.)

       Example: (let $obj be '5.6e-01 +/- 2.3e-02')

         $obj->latex(enclose => '$');
         # returns '$5.6 \cdot 10^{-1} \pm 2.3 \cdot 10^{-2}$'

       The asymmetric environment-like "enclose" can be used as follows:

         $obj->latex(enclose => ['\begin{equation}', '\end{equation}']);
         # returns'\begin{equation}5.6 \cdot 10^{-1} \pm 2.3 \cdot 10^{-2}\end{equation}'

       There are two convenience methods "latex_math" and "latex_equation"
       which do exactly what the above examples demonstrated.

       The "radix" parameter can set the radix (decimal point) used. The
       default is a dot ("."). If you use a comma, LaTeX will generally
       typeset it in a way that results in a space after the comma. Since that
       is not desireable, using a "," as the radix results in the radix being
       set as ",\!". An example can be found in the synopsis.

   latex_math
       Works exactly like latex() except that the "enclose" string defaults to
       "$".

   latex_equation
       Works exactly like latex() except that the "enclose" string defaults to
       the environment "\begin{equation}\n" and "\n\end{equation}".

   encode
       This method encodes an arbitrary UTF-8 string as TeX. Syntax:

         my $encoded = $obj->encode($string);

       For detailed documentation, please refer to TeX::Encode.

SUPPORT
       Bugs should be reported via the CPAN bug tracker at

       <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=Number-WithError-LaTeX>

       For other issues, contact the author.

SEE ALSO
       It is important that you have a look at the TeX::Encode module if you
       use the encode() method. The decode() operation from that module,
       however, is not supported by "Number::WithError::LaTeX".

       You may use Math::BigFloat with this module. Also, it should be
       possible to use Math::Symbolic to calculate larger formulas. Just
       assign a "Number::WithError::LaTeX" object to the "Math::Symbolic"
       variables and it should work.

       You also possibly want to have a look at the prefork pragma.

       The test suite is implemented using the Test::LectroTest module. In
       order to keep the total test time in reasonable bounds, the default
       number of test attempts to falsify the test properties is kept at a low
       number of 100. You can enable more rigorous testing by setting the
       environment variable "PERL_TEST_ATTEMPTS" to a higher value. A value in
       the range of 1500 to 3000 is probably a good idea, but takes a long
       time to test.
