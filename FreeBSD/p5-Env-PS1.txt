NAME
       Env::PS1 - prompt string formatter

SYNOPSIS
               # use the import function
               use Env::PS1 qw/$PS1/;
               $ENV{PS1} = '\u@\h \$ ';
               print $PS1;
               $readline = <STDIN>;

               # or tie it yourself
               tie $prompt, 'Env::PS1', 'PS1';

               # you can also tie a scalar ref
               $format = '\u@\h\$ ';
               tie $prompt, 'Env::PS1', \$format;

DESCRIPTION
       This package supplies variables that are "tied" to environment
       variables like 'PS1' and 'PS2', if read it takes the contents of the
       variable as a format string like the ones bash(1) uses to format the
       prompt.

       It is intended to be used in combination with the various ReadLine
       packages.

EXPORT
       You can request for arbitrary variables to be exported, they will be
       tied to the environment variables of the same name.

TIE
       When you "tie" a variable you can supply one argument which can either
       be the name of an environement variable or a SCALAR reference. This
       argument defaults to 'PS1'.

METHODS
       sprintf($format)
           Returns the formatted string.

           Using this method all the time is a lot less efficient then using
           the tied variable, because the tied variable caches parts of the
           format that remain the same anyway.

FORMAT
       The format is copied mostly from bash(1) because that's what it is
       supposed to be compatible with. We made some private extensions which
       obviously are not portable.

       Note that this is not the prompt format as specified by the posix
       specification, that would only know "!" for the history number and "!!"
       for a literal "!".

       Apart from the escape sequences you can also use environment variables
       in the format string; use $VAR or "${VAR}".

       The following escape sequences are recognized:

       \a  The bell character, identical to "\007"

       \d  The date in "Weekday Month Date" format

       \D{format}
           The date in strftime(3) format, uses POSIX

       \e  The escape character, identical to "\033"

       \n  Newline

       \r  Carriage return

       \s  The basename of $0

       \t  The current time in 24-hour format, identical to "\D{%H:%M:%S}"

       \T  The current time in 12-hour format, identical to "\D{%I:%M:%S}"

       \@  The current time in 12-hour am/pm format, identical to "\D{%I:%M
           %p}"

       \A  The current time in short 24-hour format, identical to "\D{%H:%M}"

       \u  The username of the current user

       \w  The current working directory

       \W  The basename of the current working directory

       \$  "#" for effective uid is 0 (root), else "$"

       \0dd
           The character corresponding to the octal number 0dd

       \\  Literal backslash

       \H  Hostname, uses Sys::Hostname

       \h  First part of the hostname

       \l  The basename of the (output) terminal device name, uses POSIX, but
           won't be really portable.

       \[ \]
           These are used to encapsulate a sequence of non-printing chars.
           Since we don't need that, they are removed.

   Extensions
       The following escapes are extensions not supported by bash, and are not
       portable:

       \L  The (output) terminal device name, uses POSIX, but won't be really
           portable.

       \C{colour}
           Insert the ANSI sequence for named colour.  Known colours are:
           black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan and white;
           background colours prefixed with "on_".  Also known are reset,
           bold, dark, underline, blink and reverse, although the effect
           depends on the terminla you use.

           Unless you want the whole commandline coloured you should end your
           prompt with "\C{reset}".

           Of course you can still use the "raw" ansi escape codes for these
           colours.

           Note that "bold" is sometimes also known as "bright", so
           "\C{bold,black}" will on some terminals render dark grey.

           If the environment variable "CLICOLOR" is defined but false colours
           are switched off automaticly.

       \P{format}
           Proc information.

           All of these are unix specific

           %a  Acpi AC status '+' or '-' for connected or not, linux specific

           %b  Acpi battery status in mWh, linux specific

           %L  Load average

           %l  First number of the load average

           %t  Acpi temperature, linux specific

           %u  Uptime

           %w  Number of users logged in

   Not implemented escapes
       The following escapes are not implemented, because they are application
       specific.

       \j  The number of jobs currently managed by the application.

       \v  The version of the application.

       \V  The release number of the application, version + patchelvel

       \!  The history number of the next command.

           This escape gets replaced by literal '!' while a literal '!' gets
           replaces by '!!'; this makes the string a posix compatible prompt,
           thus it will work if your readline module expects a posix prompt.

       \#  The command number of the next command (like history number, but
           minus the lines read from the history file).

   Customizing
       If you want to overload escapes or want to supply values for the
       application specific escapes you can put them in %Env::PS1::map, the
       key is the escape letter, the value either a string or a CODE ref. If
       you map a CODE ref it normally is called every time the prompt string
       is read. When the escape is followed by an argument in the format
       string (like "\D{argument}") the CODE ref is called only once when the
       string is cached, but in that case it may in turn return a CODE ref.
