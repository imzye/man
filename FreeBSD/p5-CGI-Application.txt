INTRODUCTION
       CGI::Application makes it easier to create sophisticated, high-
       performance, reusable web-based applications.  CGI::Application helps
       makes your web applications easier to design, write, and evolve.

       CGI::Application judiciously avoids employing technologies and
       techniques which would bind a developer to any one set of tools,
       operating system or web server.

       It is lightweight in terms of memory usage, making it suitable for
       common CGI environments, and a high performance choice in persistent
       environments like FastCGI or mod_perl.

       By adding PLUG-INS as your needs grow, you can add advanced and complex
       features when you need them.

       First released in 2000 and used and expanded by a number of
       professional website developers, CGI::Application is a stable, reliable
       choice.

USAGE EXAMPLE
       Imagine you have to write an application to search through a database
       of widgets.  Your application has three screens:

          1. Search form
          2. List of results
          3. Detail of a single record

       To write this application using CGI::Application you will create two
       files:

          1. WidgetView.pm -- Your "Application Module"
          2. widgetview.cgi -- Your "Instance Script"

       The Application Module contains all the code specific to your
       application functionality, and it exists outside of your web server's
       document root, somewhere in the Perl library search path.

       The Instance Script is what is actually called by your web server.  It
       is a very small, simple file which simply creates an instance of your
       application and calls an inherited method, run().  Following is the
       entirety of "widgetview.cgi":

          #!/usr/bin/perl -w
          use WidgetView;
          my $webapp = WidgetView->new();
          $webapp->run();

       As you can see, widgetview.cgi simply "uses" your Application module
       (which implements a Perl package called "WidgetView").  Your
       Application Module, "WidgetView.pm", is somewhat more lengthy:

          package WidgetView;
          use base 'CGI::Application';
          use strict;

          # Needed for our database connection
          use CGI::Application::Plugin::DBH;

          sub setup {
               my $self = shift;
               $self->start_mode('mode1');
               $self->run_modes(
                       'mode1' => 'showform',
                       'mode2' => 'showlist',
                       'mode3' => 'showdetail'
               );

               # Connect to DBI database, with the same args as DBI->connect();
            $self->dbh_config();
          }

          sub teardown {
               my $self = shift;

               # Disconnect when we're done, (Although DBI usually does this automatically)
               $self->dbh->disconnect();
          }

          sub showform {
               my $self = shift;

               # Get CGI query object
               my $q = $self->query();

               my $output = '';
               $output .= $q->start_html(-title => 'Widget Search Form');
               $output .= $q->start_form();
               $output .= $q->textfield(-name => 'widgetcode');
               $output .= $q->hidden(-name => 'rm', -value => 'mode2');
               $output .= $q->submit();
               $output .= $q->end_form();
               $output .= $q->end_html();

               return $output;
          }

          sub showlist {
               my $self = shift;

               # Get our database connection
               my $dbh = $self->dbh();

               # Get CGI query object
               my $q = $self->query();
               my $widgetcode = $q->param("widgetcode");

               my $output = '';
               $output .= $q->start_html(-title => 'List of Matching Widgets');

               ## Do a bunch of stuff to select "widgets" from a DBI-connected
               ## database which match the user-supplied value of "widgetcode"
               ## which has been supplied from the previous HTML form via a
               ## CGI.pm query object.
               ##
               ## Each row will contain a link to a "Widget Detail" which
               ## provides an anchor tag, as follows:
               ##
               ##   "widgetview.cgi?rm=mode3&widgetid=XXX"
               ##
               ##  ...Where "XXX" is a unique value referencing the ID of
               ## the particular "widget" upon which the user has clicked.

               $output .= $q->end_html();

               return $output;
          }

          sub showdetail {
               my $self = shift;

               # Get our database connection
               my $dbh = $self->dbh();

               # Get CGI query object
               my $q = $self->query();
               my $widgetid = $q->param("widgetid");

               my $output = '';
               $output .= $q->start_html(-title => 'Widget Detail');

               ## Do a bunch of things to select all the properties of
               ## the particular "widget" upon which the user has
               ## clicked.  The key id value of this widget is provided
               ## via the "widgetid" property, accessed via the CGI.pm
               ## query object.

               $output .= $q->end_html();

               return $output;
          }

          1;  # Perl requires this at the end of all modules

       CGI::Application takes care of implementing the new() and the run()
       methods.  Notice that at no point do you call print() to send any
       output to STDOUT.  Instead, all output is returned as a scalar.

       CGI::Application's most significant contribution is in managing the
       application state.  Notice that all which is needed to push the
       application forward is to set the value of a HTML form parameter 'rm'
       to the value of the "run mode" you wish to handle the form submission.
       This is the key to CGI::Application.

ABSTRACT
       The guiding philosophy behind CGI::Application is that a web-based
       application can be organized into a specific set of "Run Modes."  Each
       Run Mode is roughly analogous to a single screen (a form, some output,
       etc.).  All the Run Modes are managed by a single "Application Module"
       which is a Perl module.  In your web server's document space there is
       an "Instance Script" which is called by the web server as a CGI (or an
       Apache::Registry script if you're using Apache + mod_perl).

       This methodology is an inversion of the "Embedded" philosophy (ASP,
       JSP, EmbPerl, Mason, etc.) in which there are "pages" for each state of
       the application, and the page drives functionality.  In
       CGI::Application, form follows function -- the Application Module
       drives pages, and the code for a single application is in one place;
       not spread out over multiple "pages".  If you feel that Embedded
       architectures are confusing, unorganized, difficult to design and
       difficult to manage, CGI::Application is the methodology for you!

       Apache is NOT a requirement for CGI::Application.  Web applications
       based on CGI::Application will run equally well on NT/IIS or any other
       CGI-compatible environment.  CGI::Application-based projects are,
       however, ripe for use on Apache/mod_perl servers, as they naturally
       encourage Good Programming Practices and will often work in persistent
       environments without modification.

       For more information on using CGI::Application with mod_perl, please
       see our website at http://www.cgi-app.org/, as well as
       CGI::Application::Plugin::Apache, which integrates with
       Apache::Request.

DESCRIPTION
       It is intended that your Application Module will be implemented as a
       sub-class of CGI::Application. This is done simply as follows:

           package My::App;
           use base 'CGI::Application';

       Notation and Conventions

       For the purpose of this document, we will refer to the following
       conventions:

         WebApp.pm   The Perl module which implements your Application Module class.
         WebApp      Your Application Module class; a sub-class of CGI::Application.
         webapp.cgi  The Instance Script which implements your Application Module.
         $webapp     An instance (object) of your Application Module class.
         $c          Same as $webapp, used in instance methods to pass around the
                     current object. (Sometimes referred as "$self" in other code)

   Instance Script Methods
       By inheriting from CGI::Application you have access to a number of
       built-in methods.  The following are those which are expected to be
       called from your Instance Script.

       new()

       The new() method is the constructor for a CGI::Application.  It returns
       a blessed reference to your Application Module package (class).
       Optionally, new() may take a set of parameters as key => value pairs:

           my $webapp = WebApp->new(
                       TMPL_PATH => 'App/',
                       PARAMS => {
                               'custom_thing_1' => 'some val',
                               'another_custom_thing' => [qw/123 456/]
                       }
           );

       This method may take some specific parameters:

       TMPL_PATH - This optional parameter defines a path to a directory of
       templates.  This is used by the load_tmpl() method (specified below),
       and may also be used for the same purpose by other template plugins.
       This run-time parameter allows you to further encapsulate instantiating
       templates, providing potential for more re-usability.  It can be either
       a scalar or an array reference of multiple paths.

       QUERY - This optional parameter allows you to specify an already-
       created CGI.pm query object.  Under normal use, CGI::Application will
       instantiate its own CGI.pm query object.  Under certain conditions, it
       might be useful to be able to use one which has already been created.

       PARAMS - This parameter, if used, allows you to set a number of custom
       parameters at run-time.  By passing in different values in different
       instance scripts which use the same application module you can achieve
       a higher level of re-usability.  For instance, imagine an application
       module, "Mailform.pm".  The application takes the contents of a HTML
       form and emails it to a specified recipient.  You could have multiple
       instance scripts throughout your site which all use this "Mailform.pm"
       module, but which set different recipients or different forms.

       One common use of instance scripts is to provide a path to a config
       file.  This design allows you to define project wide configuration
       objects used by many several instance scripts. There are several
       plugins which simplify the syntax for this and provide lazy loading.
       Here's an example using CGI::Application::Plugin::ConfigAuto, which
       uses Config::Auto to support many configuration file formats.

        my $app = WebApp->new(PARAMS => { cfg_file => 'config.pl' });

        # Later in your app:
        my %cfg = $self->cfg()
        # or ... $self->cfg('HTML_ROOT_DIR');

       See the list of plugins below for more config file integration
       solutions.

       run()

       The run() method is called upon your Application Module object, from
       your Instance Script.  When called, it executes the functionality in
       your Application Module.

           my $webapp = WebApp->new();
           $webapp->run();

       This method first determines the application state by looking at the
       value of the CGI parameter specified by mode_param() (defaults to 'rm'
       for "Run Mode"), which is expected to contain the name of the mode of
       operation.  If not specified, the state defaults to the value of
       start_mode().

       Once the mode has been determined, run() looks at the dispatch table
       stored in run_modes() and finds the function pointer which is keyed
       from the mode name.  If found, the function is called and the data
       returned is print()'ed to STDOUT and to the browser.  If the specified
       mode is not found in the run_modes() table, run() will croak().

   PSGI support
       CGI::Application offers native PSGI support. The default query object
       for this is CGI::PSGI, which simply wrappers CGI.pm to provide PSGI
       support to it.

       psgi_app()

        $psgi_coderef = WebApp->psgi_app({ ... args to new() ... });

       The simplest way to create and return a PSGI-compatible coderef. Pass
       in arguments to a hashref just as would to new. This returns a PSGI-
       compatible coderef, using CGI:::PSGI as the query object. To use a
       different query object, construct your own object using run_as_psgi(),
       as shown below.

       It's possible that we'll change from CGI::PSGI to a different-but-
       compatible query object for PSGI support in the future, perhaps if
       CGI.pm adds native PSGI support.

       run_as_psgi()

        my $psgi_aref = $webapp->run_as_psgi;

       Just like "run", but prints no output and returns the data structure
       required by the PSGI specification. Use this if you want to run the
       application on top of a PSGI-compatible handler, such as Plack
       provides.

       If you are just getting started, just use run(). It's easy to switch to
       using "run_as_psgi" later.

       Why use run_as_psgi()? There are already solutions to run
       CGI::Application-based projects on several web servers with dozens of
       plugins.  Running as a PSGI-compatible application provides the ability
       to run on additional PSGI-compatible servers, as well as providing
       access to all of the "Middleware" solutions available through the Plack
       project.

       The structure returned is an arrayref, containing the status code, an
       arrayref of header key/values and an arrayref containing the body.

        [ 200, [ 'Content-Type' => 'text/html' ], [ $body ] ]

       By default the body is a single scalar, but plugins may modify this to
       return other value PSGI values.  See "The Response" in PSGI for details
       about the response format.

       Note that calling "run_as_psgi" only handles the output portion of the
       PSGI spec. to handle the input, you need to use a CGI.pm-like query
       object that is PSGI-compliant, such as CGI::PSGI. This query object
       must provide psgi_header and psgi_redirect methods.

       The final result might look like this:

           use WebApp;
           use CGI::PSGI;

           my $handler = sub {
               my $env = shift;
               my $webapp = WebApp->new({ QUERY => CGI::PSGI->new($env) });
               $webapp->run_as_psgi;
           };

   Additional PSGI Return Values
       The PSGI Specification allows for returning a file handle or a
       subroutine reference instead of byte strings.  In PSGI mode this is
       supported directly by CGI::Application.  Have your run mode return a
       file handle or compatible subref as follows:

               sub returning_a_file_handle {
                   my $self = shift;

                   $self->header_props(-type => 'text/plain');

               open my $fh, "<", 'test_file.txt' or die "OOPS! $!";

                   return $fh;
               }

           sub returning_a_subref {
               my $self = shift;

               $self->header_props(-type => 'text/plain');
               return sub {
                  my $writer = shift;
                  foreach my $i (1..10) {
                      #sleep 1;
                      $writer->write("check $i: " . time . "\n");
                       }
               };
           }

   Methods to possibly override
       CGI::Application implements some methods which are expected to be
       overridden by implementing them in your sub-class module.  These
       methods are as follows:

       setup()

       This method is called by the inherited new() constructor method.  The
       setup() method should be used to define the following property/methods:

           mode_param() - set the name of the run mode CGI param.
           start_mode() - text scalar containing the default run mode.
           error_mode() - text scalar containing the error mode.
           run_modes() - hash table containing mode => function mappings.
           tmpl_path() - text scalar or array reference containing path(s) to template files.

       Your setup() method may call any of the instance methods of your
       application.  This function is a good place to define properties
       specific to your application via the $webapp->param() method.

       Your setup() method might be implemented something like this:

               sub setup {
                       my $self = shift;
                       $self->tmpl_path('/path/to/my/templates/');
                       $self->start_mode('putform');
                       $self->error_mode('my_error_rm');
                       $self->run_modes({
                               'putform'  => 'my_putform_func',
                               'postdata' => 'my_data_func'
                       });
                       $self->param('myprop1');
                       $self->param('myprop2', 'prop2value');
                       $self->param('myprop3', ['p3v1', 'p3v2', 'p3v3']);
               }

       However, often times all that needs to be in setup() is defining your
       run modes and your start mode. CGI::Application::Plugin::AutoRunmode
       allows you to do this with a simple syntax, using run mode attributes:

        use CGI::Application::Plugin::AutoRunmode;

        sub show_first : StartRunmode { ... };
        sub do_next : Runmode { ... }

       teardown()

       If implemented, this method is called automatically after your
       application runs.  It can be used to clean up after your operations.  A
       typical use of the teardown() function is to disconnect a database
       connection which was established in the setup() function.  You could
       also use the teardown() method to store state information about the
       application to the server.

       cgiapp_init()

       If implemented, this method is called automatically right before the
       setup() method is called.  This method provides an optional
       initialization hook, which improves the object-oriented characteristics
       of CGI::Application.  The cgiapp_init() method receives, as its
       parameters, all the arguments which were sent to the new() method.

       An example of the benefits provided by utilizing this hook is creating
       a custom "application super-class" from which all your web applications
       would inherit, instead of CGI::Application.

       Consider the following:

         # In MySuperclass.pm:
         package MySuperclass;
         use base 'CGI::Application';
         sub cgiapp_init {
               my $self = shift;
               # Perform some project-specific init behavior
               # such as to load settings from a database or file.
         }


         # In MyApplication.pm:
         package MyApplication;
         use base 'MySuperclass';
         sub setup { ... }
         sub teardown { ... }
         # The rest of your CGI::Application-based follows...

       By using CGI::Application and the cgiapp_init() method as illustrated,
       a suite of applications could be designed to share certain
       characteristics.  This has the potential for much cleaner code built on
       object-oriented inheritance.

       cgiapp_prerun()

       If implemented, this method is called automatically right before the
       selected run mode method is called.  This method provides an optional
       pre-runmode hook, which permits functionality to be added at the point
       right before the run mode method is called.  To further leverage this
       hook, the value of the run mode is passed into cgiapp_prerun().

       Another benefit provided by utilizing this hook is creating a custom
       "application super-class" from which all your web applications would
       inherit, instead of CGI::Application.

       Consider the following:

         # In MySuperclass.pm:
         package MySuperclass;
         use base 'CGI::Application';
         sub cgiapp_prerun {
               my $self = shift;
               # Perform some project-specific init behavior
               # such as to implement run mode specific
               # authorization functions.
         }


         # In MyApplication.pm:
         package MyApplication;
         use base 'MySuperclass';
         sub setup { ... }
         sub teardown { ... }
         # The rest of your CGI::Application-based follows...

       By using CGI::Application and the cgiapp_prerun() method as
       illustrated, a suite of applications could be designed to share certain
       characteristics.  This has the potential for much cleaner code built on
       object-oriented inheritance.

       It is also possible, within your cgiapp_prerun() method, to change the
       run mode of your application.  This can be done via the prerun_mode()
       method, which is discussed elsewhere in this POD.

       cgiapp_postrun()

       If implemented, this hook will be called after the run mode method has
       returned its output, but before HTTP headers are generated.  This will
       give you an opportunity to modify the body and headers before they are
       returned to the web browser.

       A typical use for this hook is pipelining the output of a CGI-
       Application through a series of "filter" processors.  For example:

         * You want to enclose the output of all your CGI-Applications in
           an HTML table in a larger page.

         * Your run modes return structured data (such as XML), which you
           want to transform using a standard mechanism (such as XSLT).

         * You want to post-process CGI-App output through another system,
           such as HTML::Mason.

         * You want to modify HTTP headers in a particular way across all
           run modes, based on particular criteria.

       The cgiapp_postrun() hook receives a reference to the output from your
       run mode method, in addition to the CGI-App object.  A typical
       cgiapp_postrun() method might be implemented as follows:

         sub cgiapp_postrun {
           my $self = shift;
           my $output_ref = shift;

           # Enclose output HTML table
           my $new_output = "<table border=1>";
           $new_output .= "<tr><td> Hello, World! </td></tr>";
           $new_output .= "<tr><td>". $$output_ref ."</td></tr>";
           $new_output .= "</table>";

           # Replace old output with new output
           $$output_ref = $new_output;
         }

       Obviously, with access to the CGI-App object you have full access to
       use all the methods normally available in a run mode.  You could, for
       example, use load_tmpl() to replace the static HTML in this example
       with HTML::Template.  You could change the HTTP headers (via
       header_type() and header_props() methods) to set up a redirect.  You
       could also use the objects properties to apply changes only under
       certain circumstance, such as a in only certain run modes, and when a
       param() is a particular value.

       cgiapp_get_query()

        my $q = $webapp->cgiapp_get_query;

       Override this method to retrieve the query object if you wish to use a
       different query interface instead of CGI.pm.

       CGI.pm is only loaded if it is used on a given request.

       If you can use an alternative to CGI.pm, it needs to have some
       compatibility with the CGI.pm API. For normal use, just having a
       compatible "param" method should be sufficient.

       If you use the "path_info" option to the mode_param() method, then we
       will call the path_info() method on the query object.

       If you use the "Dump" method in CGI::Application, we will call the
       "Dump" and "escapeHTML" methods on the query object.

   Essential Application Methods
       The following methods are inherited from CGI::Application, and are
       available to be called by your application within your Application
       Module. They are called essential because you will use all are most of
       them to get any application up and running.  These functions are listed
       in alphabetical order.

       load_tmpl()

           my $tmpl_obj = $webapp->load_tmpl;
           my $tmpl_obj = $webapp->load_tmpl('some.html');
           my $tmpl_obj = $webapp->load_tmpl( \$template_content );
           my $tmpl_obj = $webapp->load_tmpl( FILEHANDLE );

       This method takes the name of a template file, a reference to template
       data or a FILEHANDLE and returns an HTML::Template object. If the
       filename is undefined or missing, CGI::Application will default to
       trying to use the current run mode name, plus the extension ".html".

       If you use the default template naming system, you should also use
       CGI::Application::Plugin::Forward, which simply helps to keep the
       current name accurate when you pass control from one run mode to
       another.

       ( For integration with other template systems and automated template
       names, see "Alternatives to load_tmpl() below. )

       When you pass in a filename, the HTML::Template->new_file() constructor
       is used for create the object.  When you pass in a reference to the
       template content, the HTML::Template->new_scalar_ref() constructor is
       used and when you pass in a filehandle, the
       HTML::Template->new_filehandle() constructor is used.

       Refer to HTML::Template for specific usage of HTML::Template.

       If tmpl_path() has been specified, load_tmpl() will set the
       HTML::Template "path" option to the path(s) provided.  This further
       assists in encapsulating template usage.

       The load_tmpl() method will pass any extra parameters sent to it
       directly to HTML::Template->new_file() (or new_scalar_ref() or
       new_filehandle()).  This will allow the HTML::Template object to be
       further customized:

           my $tmpl_obj = $webapp->load_tmpl('some_other.html',
                die_on_bad_params => 0,
                cache => 1
           );

       Note that if you want to pass extra arguments but use the default
       template name, you still need to provide a name of "undef":

           my $tmpl_obj = $webapp->load_tmpl(undef,
                die_on_bad_params => 0,
                cache => 1
           );

       Alternatives to load_tmpl()

       If your application requires more specialized behavior than this, you
       can always replace it by overriding load_tmpl() by implementing your
       own load_tmpl() in your CGI::Application sub-class application module.

       First, you may want to check out the template related plugins.

       CGI::Application::Plugin::TT focuses just on Template Toolkit
       integration, and features pre-and-post features, singleton support and
       more.

       CGI::Application::Plugin::Stream can help if you want to return a
       stream and not a file. It features a simple syntax and MIME-type
       detection.

       specifying the template class with html_tmpl_class()

       You may specify an API-compatible alternative to HTML::Template by
       setting a new html_tmpl_class():

         $self->html_tmpl_class('HTML::Template::Dumper');

       The default is "HTML::Template". The alternate class should provide at
       least the following parts of the HTML::Template API:

        $t = $class->new( scalarref => ... );  # If you use scalarref templates
        $t = $class->new( filehandle => ... ); # If you use filehandle templates
        $t = $class->new( filename => ... );
        $t->param(...);

       Here's an example case allowing you to precisely test what's sent to
       your templates:

           $ENV{CGI_APP_RETURN_ONLY} = 1;
           my $webapp = WebApp->new;
              $webapp->html_tmpl_class('HTML::Template::Dumper');
           my $out_str = $webapp->run;
           my $tmpl_href = eval "$out_str";

           # Now Precisely test what would be set to the template
           is ($tmpl_href->{pet_name}, 'Daisy', "Daisy is sent template");

       This is a powerful technique because HTML::Template::Dumper loads and
       considers the template file that would actually be used. If the
       'pet_name' token was missing in the template, the above test would
       fail. So, you are testing both your code and your templates in a much
       more precise way than using simple regular expressions to see if the
       string "Daisy" appeared somewhere on the page.

       The load_tmpl() callback

       Plugin authors will be interested to know that you can register a
       callback that will be executed just before load_tmpl() returns:

         $self->add_callback('load_tmpl',\&your_method);

       When your_method() is executed, it will be passed three arguments:

        1. A hash reference of the extra params passed into C<load_tmpl>
        2. Followed by a hash reference to template parameters.
           With both of these, you can modify them by reference to affect
           values that are actually passed to the new() and param() methods of the
           template object.
        3. The name of the template file.

       Here's an example stub for a load_tmpl() callback:

           sub my_load_tmpl_callback {
               my ($c, $ht_params, $tmpl_params, $tmpl_file) = @_
               # modify $ht_params or $tmpl_params by reference...
           }

       param()

           $webapp->param('pname', $somevalue);

       The param() method provides a facility through which you may set
       application instance properties which are accessible throughout your
       application.

       The param() method may be used in two basic ways.  First, you may use
       it to get or set the value of a parameter:

           $webapp->param('scalar_param', '123');
           my $scalar_param_values = $webapp->param('some_param');

       Second, when called in the context of an array, with no parameter name
       specified, param() returns an array containing all the parameters which
       currently exist:

           my @all_params = $webapp->param();

       The param() method also allows you to set a bunch of parameters at once
       by passing in a hash (or hashref):

           $webapp->param(
               'key1' => 'val1',
               'key2' => 'val2',
               'key3' => 'val3',
           );

       The param() method enables a very valuable system for customizing your
       applications on a per-instance basis.  One Application Module might be
       instantiated by different Instance Scripts.  Each Instance Script might
       set different values for a set of parameters.  This allows similar
       applications to share a common code-base, but behave differently.  For
       example, imagine a mail form application with a single Application
       Module, but multiple Instance Scripts.  Each Instance Script might
       specify a different recipient.  Another example would be a web bulletin
       boards system.  There could be multiple boards, each with a different
       topic and set of administrators.

       The new() method provides a shortcut for specifying a number of run-
       time parameters at once.  Internally, CGI::Application calls the
       param() method to set these properties.  The param() method is a
       powerful tool for greatly increasing your application's re-usability.

       query()

           my $q = $webapp->query();
           my $remote_user = $q->remote_user();

       This method retrieves the CGI.pm query object which has been created by
       instantiating your Application Module.  For details on usage of this
       query object, refer to CGI.  CGI::Application is built on the CGI
       module.  Generally speaking, you will want to become very familiar with
       CGI.pm, as you will use the query object whenever you want to interact
       with form data.

       When the new() method is called, a CGI query object is automatically
       created.  If, for some reason, you want to use your own CGI query
       object, the new() method supports passing in your existing query object
       on construction using the QUERY attribute.

       There are a few rare situations where you want your own query object to
       be used after your Application Module has already been constructed. In
       that case you can pass it to c<query()> like this:

           $webapp->query($new_query_object);
           my $q = $webapp->query(); # now uses $new_query_object

       run_modes()

           # The common usage: an arrayref of run mode names that exactly match subroutine names
           $webapp->run_modes([qw/
               form_display
               form_process
           /]);

          # With a hashref, use a different name or a code ref
          $webapp->run_modes(
                  'mode1' => 'some_sub_by_name',
                  'mode2' => \&some_other_sub_by_ref
           );

       This accessor/mutator specifies the dispatch table for the application
       states, using the syntax examples above. It returns the dispatch table
       as a hash.

       The run_modes() method may be called more than once.  Additional values
       passed into run_modes() will be added to the run modes table.  In the
       case that an existing run mode is re-defined, the new value will
       override the existing value.  This behavior might be useful for
       applications which are created via inheritance from another
       application, or some advanced application which modifies its own
       capabilities based on user input.

       The run() method uses the data in this table to send the application to
       the correct function as determined by reading the CGI parameter
       specified by mode_param() (defaults to 'rm' for "Run Mode").  These
       functions are referred to as "run mode methods".

       The hash table set by this method is expected to contain the mode name
       as a key.  The value should be either a hard reference (a subref) to
       the run mode method which you want to be called when the application
       enters the specified run mode, or the name of the run mode method to be
       called:

           'mode_name_by_ref'  => \&mode_function
           'mode_name_by_name' => 'mode_function'

       The run mode method specified is expected to return a block of text
       (e.g.: HTML) which will eventually be sent back to the web browser.
       The run mode method may return its block of text as a scalar or a
       scalar-ref.

       An advantage of specifying your run mode methods by name instead of by
       reference is that you can more easily create derivative applications
       using inheritance.  For instance, if you have a new application which
       is exactly the same as an existing application with the exception of
       one run mode, you could simply inherit from that other application and
       override the run mode method which is different.  If you specified your
       run mode method by reference, your child class would still use the
       function from the parent class.

       An advantage of specifying your run mode methods by reference instead
       of by name is performance.  Dereferencing a subref is faster than
       eval()-ing a code block.  If run-time performance is a critical issue,
       specify your run mode methods by reference and not by name.  The speed
       differences are generally small, however, so specifying by name is
       preferred.

       Specifying the run modes by array reference:

           $webapp->run_modes([ 'mode1', 'mode2', 'mode3' ]);

       This is the same as using a hash, with keys equal to values

           $webapp->run_modes(
               'mode1' => 'mode1',
               'mode2' => 'mode2',
               'mode3' => 'mode3'
           );

       Often, it makes good organizational sense to have your run modes map to
       methods of the same name.  The array-ref interface provides a shortcut
       to that behavior while reducing verbosity of your code.

       Note that another importance of specifying your run modes in either a
       hash or array-ref is to assure that only those Perl methods which are
       specifically designated may be called via your application.
       Application environments which don't specify allowed methods and
       disallow all others are insecure, potentially opening the door to
       allowing execution of arbitrary code.  CGI::Application maintains a
       strict "default-deny" stance on all method invocation, thereby allowing
       secure applications to be built upon it.

       IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT RUN MODE METHODS

       Your application should *NEVER* print() to STDOUT.  Using print() to
       send output to STDOUT (including HTTP headers) is exclusively the
       domain of the inherited run() method.  Breaking this rule is a common
       source of errors.  If your program is erroneously sending content
       before your HTTP header, you are probably breaking this rule.

       THE RUN MODE OF LAST RESORT: "AUTOLOAD"

       If CGI::Application is asked to go to a run mode which doesn't exist it
       will usually croak() with errors.  If this is not your desired
       behavior, it is possible to catch this exception by implementing a run
       mode with the reserved name "AUTOLOAD":

         $self->run_modes(
               "AUTOLOAD" => \&catch_my_exception
         );

       Before CGI::Application calls croak() it will check for the existence
       of a run mode called "AUTOLOAD".  If specified, this run mode will in
       invoked just like a regular run mode, with one exception:  It will
       receive, as an argument, the name of the run mode which invoked it:

         sub catch_my_exception {
               my $self = shift;
               my $intended_runmode = shift;

               my $output = "Looking for '$intended_runmode', but found 'AUTOLOAD' instead";
               return $output;
         }

       This functionality could be used for a simple human-readable error
       screen, or for more sophisticated application behaviors.

       start_mode()

           $webapp->start_mode('mode1');

       The start_mode contains the name of the mode as specified in the
       run_modes() table.  Default mode is "start".  The mode key specified
       here will be used whenever the value of the CGI form parameter
       specified by mode_param() is not defined.  Generally, this is the first
       time your application is executed.

       tmpl_path()

           $webapp->tmpl_path('/path/to/some/templates/');

       This access/mutator method sets the file path to the directory (or
       directories) where the templates are stored.  It is used by load_tmpl()
       to find the template files, using HTML::Template's "path" option. To
       set the path you can either pass in a text scalar or an array reference
       of multiple paths.

   More Application Methods
       You can skip this section if you are just getting started.

       The following additional methods are inherited from CGI::Application,
       and are available to be called by your application within your
       Application Module.  These functions are listed in alphabetical order.

       delete()

           $webapp->delete('my_param');

       The delete() method is used to delete a parameter that was previously
       stored inside of your application either by using the PARAMS hash that
       was passed in your call to new() or by a call to the param() method.
       This is similar to the delete() method of CGI.pm. It is useful if your
       application makes decisions based on the existence of certain params
       that may have been removed in previous sections of your app or simply
       to clean-up your param()s.

       dump()

           print STDERR $webapp->dump();

       The dump() method is a debugging function which will return a chunk of
       text which contains all the environment and web form data of the
       request, formatted nicely for human readability.  Useful for outputting
       to STDERR.

       dump_html()

           my $output = $webapp->dump_html();

       The dump_html() method is a debugging function which will return a
       chunk of text which contains all the environment and web form data of
       the request, formatted nicely for human readability via a web browser.
       Useful for outputting to a browser. Please consider the security
       implications of using this in production code.

       error_mode()

           $webapp->error_mode('my_error_rm');

       If the runmode dies for whatever reason, "run() will" see if you have
       set a value for error_mode(). If you have, run() will call that method
       as a run mode, passing $@ as the only parameter.

       Plugins authors will be interested to know that just before
       error_mode() is called, the "error" hook will be executed, with the
       error message passed in as the only parameter.

       No "error_mode" is defined by default.  The death of your error_mode()
       run mode is not trapped, so you can also use it to die in your own
       special way.

       CGI::Application::Plugin::LogDispatch.

       get_current_runmode()

           $webapp->get_current_runmode();

       The get_current_runmode() method will return a text scalar containing
       the name of the run mode which is currently being executed.  If the run
       mode has not yet been determined, such as during setup(), this method
       will return undef.

       header_add()

           # add or replace the 'type' header
           $webapp->header_add( -type => 'image/png' );

           - or -

           # add an additional cookie
           $webapp->header_add(-cookie=>[$extra_cookie]);

       The header_add() method is used to add one or more headers to the
       outgoing response headers.  The parameters will eventually be passed on
       to the CGI.pm header() method, so refer to the CGI docs for exact usage
       details.

       Unlike calling header_props(), header_add() will preserve any existing
       headers. If a scalar value is passed to header_add() it will replace
       the existing value for that key.

       If an array reference is passed as a value to header_add(), values in
       that array ref will be appended to any existing values for that key.
       This is primarily useful for setting an additional cookie after one has
       already been set.

       header_props()

           # Set a complete set of headers
           %set_headers = $webapp->header_props(-type=>'image/gif',-expires=>'+3d');

           # clobber / reset all headers
           %set_headers = $webapp->header_props({});

           # Just retrieve the headers
           %set_headers = $webapp->header_props();

       The header_props() method expects a hash of CGI.pm-compatible HTTP
       header properties.  These properties will be passed directly to the
       header() or redirect() methods of the query() object. Refer to the docs
       of your query object for details. (Be default, it's CGI.pm).

       Calling header_props with an empty hashref clobber any existing headers
       that have previously set.

       header_props() returns a hash of all the headers that have currently
       been set. It can be called with no arguments just to get the hash
       current headers back.

       To add additional headers later without clobbering the old ones, see
       header_add().

       IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING HTTP HEADERS

       It is through the header_props() and header_add() method that you may
       modify the outgoing HTTP headers.  This is necessary when you want to
       set a cookie, set the mime type to something other than "text/html", or
       perform a redirect.  The header_props() method works in conjunction
       with the header_type() method.  The value contained in header_type()
       determines if we use CGI::header() or CGI::redirect().  The content of
       header_props() is passed as an argument to whichever CGI.pm function is
       called.

       Understanding this relationship is important if you wish to manipulate
       the HTTP header properly.

       header_type()

           $webapp->header_type('redirect');
           $webapp->header_type('none');

       This method used to declare that you are setting a redirection header,
       or that you want no header to be returned by the framework.

       The value of 'header' is almost never used, as it is the default.

       Example of redirecting:

         sub some_redirect_mode {
           my $self = shift;
           # do stuff here....
           $self->header_type('redirect');
           $self->header_props(-url=>  "http://site/path/doc.html" );
         }

       To simplify that further, use CGI::Application::Plugin::Redirect:

           return $self->redirect('http://www.example.com/');

       Setting the header to 'none' may be useful if you are streaming
       content.  In other contexts, it may be more useful to set
       "$ENV{CGI_APP_RETURN_ONLY} = 1;", which suppresses all printing,
       including headers, and returns the output instead.

       That's commonly used for testing, or when using CGI::Application as a
       controller for a cron script!

       mode_param()

        # Name the CGI form parameter that contains the run mode name.
        # This is the default behavior, and is often sufficient.
        $webapp->mode_param('rm');

        # Set the run mode name directly from a code ref
        $webapp->mode_param(\&some_method);

        # Alternate interface, which allows you to set the run
        # mode name directly from $ENV{PATH_INFO}.
        $webapp->mode_param(
               path_info=> 1,
               param =>'rm'
        );

       This accessor/mutator method is generally called in the setup() method.
       It is used to help determine the run mode to call. There are three
       options for calling it.

        $webapp->mode_param('rm');

       Here, a CGI form parameter is named that will contain the name of the
       run mode to use. This is the default behavior, with 'rm' being the
       parameter named used.

        $webapp->mode_param(\&some_method);

       Here a code reference is provided. It will return the name of the run
       mode to use directly. Example:

        sub some_method {
          my $self = shift;
          return 'run_mode_x';
        }

       This would allow you to programmatically set the run mode based on
       arbitrary logic.

        $webapp->mode_param(
               path_info=> 1,
               param =>'rm'
        );

       This syntax allows you to easily set the run mode from $ENV{PATH_INFO}.
       It will try to set the run mode from the first part of $ENV{PATH_INFO}
       (before the first "/"). To specify that you would rather get the run
       mode name from the 2nd part of $ENV{PATH_INFO}:

        $webapp->mode_param( path_info=> 2 );

       This also demonstrates that you don't need to pass in the "param" hash
       key. It will still default to "rm".

       You can also set "path_info" to a negative value. This works just like
       a negative list index: if it is -1 the run mode name will be taken from
       the last part of $ENV{PATH_INFO}, if it is -2, the one before that, and
       so on.

       If no run mode is found in $ENV{PATH_INFO}, it will fall back to
       looking in the value of a the CGI form field defined with 'param', as
       described above.  This allows you to use the convenient $ENV{PATH_INFO}
       trick most of the time, but also supports the edge cases, such as when
       you don't know what the run mode will be ahead of time and want to
       define it with JavaScript.

       More about $ENV{PATH_INFO}.

       Using $ENV{PATH_INFO} to name your run mode creates a clean separation
       between the form variables you submit and how you determine the
       processing run mode. It also creates URLs that are more search engine
       friendly. Let's look at an example form submission using this syntax:

               <form action="/cgi-bin/instance.cgi/edit_form" method=post>
                       <input type="hidden" name="breed_id" value="4">

       Here the run mode would be set to "edit_form". Here's another example
       with a query string:

               /cgi-bin/instance.cgi/edit_form?breed_id=2

       This demonstrates that you can use $ENV{PATH_INFO} and a query string
       together without problems. $ENV{PATH_INFO} is defined as part of the
       CGI specification should be supported by any web server that supports
       CGI scripts.

       prerun_mode()

           $webapp->prerun_mode('new_run_mode');

       The prerun_mode() method is an accessor/mutator which can be used
       within your cgiapp_prerun() method to change the run mode which is
       about to be executed.  For example, consider:

         # In WebApp.pm:
         package WebApp;
         use base 'CGI::Application';
         sub cgiapp_prerun {
               my $self = shift;

               # Get the web user name, if any
               my $q = $self->query();
               my $user = $q->remote_user();

               # Redirect to login, if necessary
               unless ($user) {
                       $self->prerun_mode('login');
               }
         }

       In this example, the web user will be forced into the "login" run mode
       unless they have already logged in.  The prerun_mode() method permits a
       scalar text string to be set which overrides whatever the run mode
       would otherwise be.

       The use of prerun_mode() within cgiapp_prerun() differs from setting
       mode_param() to use a call-back via subroutine reference.  It differs
       because cgiapp_prerun() allows you to selectively set the run mode
       based on some logic in your cgiapp_prerun() method.  The call-back
       facility of mode_param() forces you to entirely replace
       CGI::Application's mechanism for determining the run mode with your own
       method.  The prerun_mode() method should be used in cases where you
       want to use CGI::Application's normal run mode switching facility, but
       you want to make selective changes to the mode under specific
       conditions.

       Note:  The prerun_mode() method may ONLY be called in the context of a
       cgiapp_prerun() method.  Your application will die() if you call
       prerun_mode() elsewhere, such as in setup() or a run mode method.

   Dispatching Clean URIs to run modes
       Modern web frameworks dispense with cruft in URIs, providing in clean
       URIs instead. Instead of:

        /cgi-bin/item.cgi?rm=view&id=15

       A clean URI to describe the same resource might be:

        /item/15/view

       The process of mapping these URIs to run modes is called dispatching
       and is handled by CGI::Application::Dispatch. Dispatching is not
       required and is a layer you can fairly easily add to an application
       later.

   Offline website development
       You can work on your CGI::Application project on your desktop or laptop
       without installing a full-featured web-server like Apache. Instead,
       install CGI::Application::Server from CPAN. After a few minutes of
       setup, you'll have your own private application server up and running.

   Automated Testing
       Test::WWW::Mechanize::CGIApp allows functional testing of a
       CGI::App-based project without starting a web server.
       Test::WWW::Mechanize could be used to test the app through a real web
       server.

       Direct testing is also easy. CGI::Application will normally print the
       output of it's run modes directly to STDOUT. This can be suppressed
       with an environment variable, CGI_APP_RETURN_ONLY. For example:

         $ENV{CGI_APP_RETURN_ONLY} = 1;
         $output = $webapp->run();
         like($output, qr/good/, "output is good");

       Examples of this style can be seen in our own test suite.

PLUG-INS
       CGI::Application has a plug-in architecture that is easy to use and
       easy to develop new plug-ins for.

   Recommended Plug-ins
       The following plugins are recommended for general purpose web/db
       development:

       •   CGI::Application::Plugin::Redirect - is a simple plugin to provide
           a shorter syntax for executing a redirect.

       •   CGI::Application::Plugin::ConfigAuto - Keeping your config details
           in a separate file is recommended for every project. This one
           integrates with Config::Auto. Several more config plugin options
           are listed below.

       •   CGI::Application::Plugin::DBH - Provides easy management of one or
           more database handles and can delay making the database connection
           until the moment it is actually used.

       •   CGI::Application::Plugin::FillInForm - makes it a breeze to fill in
           an HTML form from data originating from a CGI query or a database
           record.

       •   CGI::Application::Plugin::Session - For a project that requires
           session management, this plugin provides a useful wrapper around
           CGI::Session

       •   CGI::Application::Plugin::ValidateRM - Integration with
           Data::FormValidator and HTML::FillInForm

   More plug-ins
       Many more plugins are available as alternatives and for specific uses.
       For a current complete list, please consult CPAN:

       http://search.cpan.org/search?m=dist&q=CGI%2DApplication%2DPlugin

       •   CGI::Application::Plugin::AnyTemplate - Use any templating system
           from within CGI::Application using a unified interface

       •   CGI::Application::Plugin::Apache - Use Apache::* modules without
           interference

       •   CGI::Application::Plugin::AutoRunmode - Automatically register
           runmodes

       •   CGI::Application::Plugin::Config::Context - Integration with
           Config::Context.

       •   CGI::Application::Plugin::Config::General - Integration with
           Config::General.

       •   CGI::Application::Plugin::Config::Simple - Integration with
           Config::Simple.

       •   CGI::Application::Plugin::CompressGzip - Add Gzip compression

       •   CGI::Application::Plugin::LogDispatch - Integration with
           Log::Dispatch

       •   CGI::Application::Plugin::Stream - Help stream files to the browser

       •   CGI::Application::Plugin::TemplateRunner - Allows for more of an
           ASP-style code structure, with the difference that code and HTML
           for each screen are in separate files.

       •   CGI::Application::Plugin::TT - Use Template::Toolkit as an
           alternative to HTML::Template.

       Consult each plug-in for the exact usage syntax.

   Writing Plug-ins
       Writing plug-ins is simple. Simply create a new package, and export the
       methods that you want to become part of a CGI::Application project. See
       CGI::Application::Plugin::ValidateRM for an example.

       In order to avoid namespace conflicts within a CGI::Application object,
       plugin developers are recommended to use a unique prefix, such as the
       name of plugin package, when storing information. For instance:

        $app->{__PARAM} = 'foo'; # BAD! Could conflict.
        $app->{'MyPlugin::Module::__PARAM'} = 'foo'; # Good.
        $app->{'MyPlugin::Module'}{__PARAM} = 'foo'; # Good.

   Writing Advanced Plug-ins - Using callbacks
       When writing a plug-in, you may want some action to happen
       automatically at a particular stage, such as setting up a database
       connection or initializing a session. By using these 'callback'
       methods, you can register a subroutine to run at a particular phase,
       accomplishing this goal.

       Callback Examples

         # register a callback to the standard CGI::Application hooks
         #   one of 'init', 'prerun', 'postrun', 'teardown' or 'load_tmpl'
         # As a plug-in author, this is probably the only method you need.

         # Class-based: callback will persist for all runs of the application
         $class->add_callback('init', \&some_other_method);

         # Object-based: callback will only last for lifetime of this object
         $self->add_callback('prerun', \&some_method);

         # If you want to create a new hook location in your application,
         # You'll need to know about the following two methods to create
         # the hook and call it.

         # Create a new hook
         $self->new_hook('pretemplate');

         # Then later execute all the callbacks registered at this hook
         $self->call_hook('pretemplate');

       Callback Methods

       add_callback()

               $self->add_callback ('teardown', \&callback);
               $class->add_callback('teardown', 'method');

       The add_callback method allows you to register a callback function that
       is to be called at the given stage of execution.  Valid hooks include
       'init', 'prerun', 'postrun' and 'teardown', 'load_tmpl', and any other
       hooks defined using the "new_hook" method.

       The callback should be a reference to a subroutine or the name of a
       method.

       If multiple callbacks are added to the same hook, they will all be
       executed one after the other.  The exact order depends on which class
       installed each callback, as described below under Callback Ordering.

       Callbacks can either be object-based or class-based, depending upon
       whether you call "add_callback" as an object method or a class method:

               # add object-based callback
               $self->add_callback('teardown', \&callback);

               # add class-based callbacks
               $class->add_callback('teardown', \&callback);
               My::Project->add_callback('teardown', \&callback);

       Object-based callbacks are stored in your web application's $c object;
       at the end of the request when the $c object goes out of scope, the
       callbacks are gone too.

       Object-based callbacks are useful for one-time tasks that apply only to
       the current running application.  For instance you could install a
       "teardown" callback to trigger a long-running process to execute at the
       end of the current request, after all the HTML has been sent to the
       browser.

       Class-based callbacks survive for the duration of the running Perl
       process.  (In a persistent environment such as "mod_perl" or
       "PersistentPerl", a single Perl process can serve many web requests.)

       Class-based callbacks are useful for plugins to add features to all web
       applications.

       Another feature of class-based callbacks is that your plugin can create
       hooks and add callbacks at any time - even before the web application's
       $c object has been initialized.  A good place to do this is in your
       plugin's "import" subroutine:

               package CGI::Application::Plugin::MyPlugin;
               use base 'Exporter';
               sub import {
                       my $caller = scalar(caller);
                       $caller->add_callback('init', 'my_setup');
                       goto &Exporter::import;
               }

       Notice that "$caller->add_callback" installs the callback on behalf of
       the module that contained the line:

               use CGI::Application::Plugin::MyPlugin;

       new_hook(HOOK)

           $self->new_hook('pretemplate');

       The new_hook() method can be used to create a new location for
       developers to register callbacks.  It takes one argument, a hook name.
       The hook location is created if it does not already exist. A true value
       is always returned.

       For an example, CGI::Application::Plugin::TT adds hooks before and
       after every template is processed.

       See call_hook(HOOK) for more details about how hooks are called.

       call_hook(HOOK)

           $self->call_hook('pretemplate', @args);

       The "call_hook" method is used to executed the callbacks that have been
       registered at the given hook.  It is used in conjunction with the
       "new_hook" method which allows you to create a new hook location.

       The first argument to "call_hook" is the hook name. Any remaining
       arguments are passed to every callback executed at the hook location.
       So, a stub for a callback at the 'pretemplate' hook would look like
       this:

        sub my_hook {
           my ($c,@args) = @_;
           # ....
        }

       Note that hooks are semi-public locations. Calling a hook means
       executing callbacks that were registered to that hook by the current
       object and also those registered by any of the current object's parent
       classes.  See below for the exact ordering.

       Callback Ordering

       Object-based callbacks are run before class-based callbacks.

       The order of class-based callbacks is determined by the inheritance
       tree of the running application. The built-in methods of "cgiapp_init",
       "cgiapp_prerun", "cgiapp_postrun", and "teardown" are also executed
       this way, according to the ordering below.

       In a persistent environment, there might be a lot of applications in
       memory at the same time.  For instance:

               CGI::Application
                 Other::Project   # uses CGI::Application::Plugin::Baz
                        Other::App    # uses CGI::Application::Plugin::Bam

                 My::Project      # uses CGI::Application::Plugin::Foo
                        My::App       # uses CGI::Application::Plugin::Bar

       Suppose that each of the above plugins each added a callback to be run
       at the 'init' stage:

               Plugin                           init callback
               ------                           -------------
               CGI::Application::Plugin::Baz    baz_startup
               CGI::Application::Plugin::Bam    bam_startup

               CGI::Application::Plugin::Foo    foo_startup
               CGI::Application::Plugin::Bar    bar_startup

       When "My::App" runs, only "foo_callback" and "bar_callback" will run.
       The other callbacks are skipped.

       The @ISA list of "My::App" is:

               My::App
               My::Project
               CGI::Application

       This order determines the order of callbacks run.

       When call_hook('init') is run on a "My::App" application, callbacks
       installed by these modules are run in order, resulting in:
       "bar_startup", "foo_startup", and then finally "cgiapp_init".

       If a single class installs more than one callback at the same hook,
       then these callbacks are run in the order they were registered (FIFO).

CREDITS

       Thanks to Vanguard Media (http://www.vm.com) for funding the initial
       development of this library and for encouraging Jesse Erlbaum to
       release it to the world.

       Many thanks to Sam Tregar (author of the most excellent HTML::Template
       module!) for his innumerable contributions to this module over the
       years, and most of all for getting me off my ass to finally get this
       thing up on CPAN!

       Many other people have contributed specific suggestions or patches,
       which are documented in the "Changes" file.

       Thanks also to all the members of the CGI-App mailing list!  Your
       ideas, suggestions, insights (and criticism!) have helped shape this
       module immeasurably.  (To join the mailing list, visit
