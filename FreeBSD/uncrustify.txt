NAME
       uncrustify - C, C++, C#, D, Java and Pawn source code beautifier


SYNOPSIS
       uncrustify [OPTIONS] [FILES]


DESCRIPTION
       If no input files are specified, the input is read from stdin.
       If reading from stdin, you should specify the language using -l.

       If -F is used or files are specified on the command line, the output
       filename is PFX + "/" + filename + SFX.
       Unless, of course, the options --replace or --no-backup are used.

       When reading from stdin or doing a single file via the '-f' option, the
       output is dumped to stdout, unless redirected with -o FILE.

       Errors are always dumped to stderr


OPTIONS
   Basic Options:
       -c CFG Use the config file CFG, or defaults if CFG is set to '-'.
              If not specified, uncrustify will use $UNCRUSTIFY_CONFIG or
              $HOME/.uncrustify.cfg.

       -f FILE
              Process the single file FILE, sending output to stdout or the
              file specified with -o.

       -o FILE
              Redirect output to FILE.
              Use with -f, --update-config, --update-config-with-doc,
              --universalindent.

       --check
              Do not output the new text, instead verify that nothing changes
              when the file(s) are processed. The status of every file is
              printed to stderr. The exit code is EXIT_SUCCESS if there were
              no changes, EXIT_FAILURE otherwise.

       -F FILE
              Read files to process from FILE, one filename per line.  If FILE
              is ´-´ then read filenames from standard input instead of a
              file.
              You can create this file using something like ´find . -name
              "*.c" > list.txt´.
              This cannot be combined with -f.

       --prefix PFX
              Prepend PFX to the output filename path.
              This cannot be combined with -f, --replace, or --no-backup.

       --suffix SFX
              Append SFX to the output filename.
              The default is '.uncrustify' if neither SFX or PFX are
              specified.
              This cannot be combined with -f, --replace, or --no-backup.

       --frag Assume the input is a code fragment and the first line is
              properly indented.

       --replace
              Replace source files (creates a backup).
              This cannot be combined with -f, --prefix, or --suffix.

       --no-backup
              Replace files, no backup. Useful if files are under source
              control
              This cannot be combined with -f, --prefix, or --suffix.

       --if-changed
              Write to stdout (or create output FILE) only if a change was
              detected.

       --mtime
              Preserve mtime on replaced files.

       -l     Language override: C, CPP, D, CS, JAVA, PAWN, VALA, OC, OC+

       -t     Load a file with types (usually not needed)

       -q     Quiet mode - no output on stderr (-L will override)

   Config/Help Options:
       -h -? --help --usage
              Print this message and exit

       --version
              Print the version and exit

       --count-options
              Print the number of available options and exit

       --show-config
              Print out option documentation and exit

       --update-config
              Output a new config file.

       --update-config-with-doc
              Output a new config file with embedded usage comments.

       --universalindent
              Output a config file for Universal Indent GUI.

       --detect
              Detects the config from a source file. Use with '-f FILE'.
              Detection is currently fairly limited.

       --tracking space:FILE
              Prepare space tracking information for debugging.

       --tracking nl:FILE
              Prepare newline tracking information for debugging.

       --tracking start:FILE
              Prepare start of statement tracking information for debugging.
              Cannot be used with the -o option.


   Debug Options:
       -p FILE
              Dump debug info into FILE, or to stdout if FILE is set to '-'.
              Must be used in combination with '-f FILE'.

       -ds FILE --dump-steps FILE
              Dump parsing info at various moments of the formatting process.
              This creates a series of files named 'FILE_nnn.log', each
              corresponding to a formatting step in uncrustify.
              The file 'FILE_000.log' lists the formatting options in use.
              Must be used in combination with '-f FILE'.

       -L SEV Set the log severity (see log_levels.h)

       -s     Show the log severity in the logs

       --decode FLAG
              Print FLAG as text and exit


EXAMPLES
       Read a D file from stdin, output to stdout.
              cat foo.d | uncrustify -q -c my.cfg -l d

       Process a file, output to stdout.
              uncrustify -c my.cfg -d foo.d

       Process a source tree, output to a different tree.
              find src -name "*.[ch]" > files.txt
              uncrustify -c my.cfg -F files.txt --prefix out

       Process a source tree in‐place.
              uncrustify -c my.cfg --no-backup $(find src -name "*.[ch]")


NOTES
       Use comments containing ' *INDENT-OFF*' and ' *INDENT-ON*' to disable
       processing of parts of the source file.
