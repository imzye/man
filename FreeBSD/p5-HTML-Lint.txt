NAME
       HTML::Lint - check for HTML errors in a string or file

VERSION
       Version 2.32

SYNOPSIS
           my $lint = HTML::Lint->new;
           $lint->only_types( HTML::Lint::Error::STRUCTURE );

           # Parse lines of data.
           $lint->newfile( $filename );
           while ( my $line = <> ) {
               $lint->parse( $line );
           }
           $lint->eof();

           # Or, parse an entire file at once.
           $lint->parse_file( $filename );

           # Fetch the errors that the linter found.
           my $error_count = $lint->errors;

           foreach my $error ( $lint->errors ) {
               print $error->as_string, "\n";
           }

       HTML::Lint also comes with a wrapper program called weblint that
       handles linting from the command line:

           $ weblint http://www.cnn.com/
           http://www.cnn.com/ (395:83) <IMG SRC="spacer.gif"> tag has no HEIGHT and WIDTH attributes.
           http://www.cnn.com/ (395:83) <IMG SRC="goofus.gif"> does not have ALT text defined
           http://www.cnn.com/ (396:217) Unknown element <nobr>
           http://www.cnn.com/ (396:241) </nobr> with no opening <nobr>
           http://www.cnn.com/ (842:7) target attribute in <a> is repeated

       And finally, you can also get Apache::HTML::Lint that passes any
       mod_perl-generated code through HTML::Lint and get it dumped into your
       Apache error_log.

           [Mon Jun  3 14:03:31 2002] [warn] /foo.pl (1:45) </p> with no opening <p>
           [Mon Jun  3 14:03:31 2002] [warn] /foo.pl (1:49) Unknown element <gronk>
           [Mon Jun  3 14:03:31 2002] [warn] /foo.pl (1:56) Unknown attribute "x" for tag <table>

METHODS
       NOTE: Some of these methods mirror HTML::Parser's methods, but
       HTML::Lint is not a subclass of HTML::Parser.

   new()
       Create an HTML::Lint object, which inherits from HTML::Parser.  You may
       pass the types of errors you want to check for in the "only_types"
       parm.

           my $lint = HTML::Lint->new( only_types => HTML::Lint::Error::STRUCTURE );

       If you want more than one, you must pass an arrayref:

           my $lint = HTML::Lint->new(
               only_types => [HTML::Lint::Error::STRUCTURE, HTML::Lint::Error::FLUFF] );

   $lint->parser()
       Returns the parser object for this object, creating one if necessary.

   $lint->parse( $text )
   $lint->parse( $code_ref )
       Passes in a chunk of HTML to be linted, either as a piece of text, or a
       code reference.  See HTML::Parser's "parse_file" method for details.

   $lint->parse_file( $file )
       Analyzes HTML directly from a file. The $file argument can be a
       filename, an open file handle, or a reference to an open file handle.
       See HTML::Parser's "parse_file" method for details.

   $lint->eof()
       Signals the end of a block of text getting passed in.  This must be
       called to make sure that all parsing is complete before looking at
       errors.

       Any parameters (and there shouldn't be any) are passed through to
       HTML::Parser's eof() method.

   $lint->errors()
       In list context, "errors" returns all of the errors found in the parsed
       text.  Each error is an object of the type HTML::Lint::Error.

       In scalar context, it returns the number of errors found.

   $lint->clear_errors()
       Clears the list of errors, in case you want to print and clear, print
       and clear.

   $lint->only_types( $type1[, $type2...] )
       Specifies to only want errors of a certain type.

           $lint->only_types( HTML::Lint::Error::STRUCTURE );

       Calling this without parameters makes the object return all possible
       errors.

       The error types are "STRUCTURE", "HELPER" and "FLUFF".  See
       HTML::Lint::Error for details on these types.

   $lint->gripe( $errcode, [$key1=>$val1, ...] )
       Adds an error message, in the form of an HTML::Lint::Error object, to
       the list of error messages for the current object.  The file, line and
       column are automatically passed to the HTML::Lint::Error constructor,
       as well as whatever other key value pairs are passed.

       For example:

           $lint->gripe( 'attr-repeated', tag => $tag, attr => $attr );

       Usually, the user of the object won't call this directly, but just in
       case, here you go.

   $lint->newfile( $filename )
       Call newfile() whenever you switch to another file in a batch of
       linting.  Otherwise, the object thinks everything is from the same
       file.  Note that the list of errors is NOT cleared.

       Note that $filename does NOT need to match what's put into parse() or
       parse_file().  It can be a description, a URL, or whatever.

       You should call newfile() even if you are only validating one file. If
       you do not call newfile() then your errors will not have a filename
       attached to them.

MODIFYING HTML::LINT'S BEHAVIOR
       Sometimes you'll have HTML that for some reason cannot conform to
       HTML::Lint's expectations.  For those instances, you can use HTML
       comments to modify HTML::Lint's behavior.

       Say you have an image where for whatever reason you can't get
       dimensions for the image.  This HTML snippet:

           <img src="logo.png" height="120" width="50" alt="Company logo">
           <img src="that.png">

       causes this error:

           foo.html (14:20) <img src="that.png"> tag has no HEIGHT and WIDTH attributes

       But if for some reason you can't get those dimensions when you build
       the page, you can at least stop HTML::Lint complaining about it.

           <img src="this.png" height="120" width="50" alt="Company logo">
           <!-- html-lint elem-img-sizes-missing: off, elem-img-alt-missing: off -->
           <img src="that.png">
           <!-- html-lint elem-img-sizes-missing: on, elem-img-alt-missing: off -->

       If you want to turn off all HTML::Lint warnings for a block of code,
       use

           <!-- html-lint all: off -->

       And turn them back on with

           <!-- html-lint all: on -->

       You don't have to use "on" and "off".  For "on", you can use "true" or
       "1".  For "off", you can use "0" or "false".

       For a list of possible errors and their codes, see HTML::Lint::Error,
       or run perldoc HTML::Lint::Error.

TODO
       •   Check for attributes that require values

       •   <TABLE>s that have no rows.

       •   Form fields that aren't in a FORM

       •   DIVs with nothing in them.

       •   HEIGHT= that have percents in them.

       •   Check for goofy stuff like:

               <b><li></b><b>Hello Reader - Spanish Level 1 (K-3)</b>
