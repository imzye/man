NG_RFC1490(4)          FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual          NG_RFC1490(4)

NAME
     ng_rfc1490 – RFC 1490 netgraph node type

SYNOPSIS
     #include <netgraph/ng_rfc1490.h>

DESCRIPTION
     The rfc1490 node type performs protocol encapsulation, de-encapsulation,
     and multiplexing according to RFC 1490 (which has since been updated by
     RFC 2427).  This particular type of encapsulation is often used on top of
     frame relay DLCI channels.

     The downstream hook is used to transmit and receive encapsulated frames.
     On the other side of the node, the inet and ppp hooks are used to
     transmit and receive raw IP frames and PPP frames, respectively.  PPP
     frames are transmitted and received according to RFC 1973; in particular,
     frames appearing on the ppp hook begin with the PPP protocol number.  The
     ethernet hook can be used to transmit and receive Ethernet frames
     (without a checksum) in RFC 1490's bridging format.

     Typically the inet hook is connected to the inet hook of an ng_iface(4)
     node.

HOOKS
     This node type supports the following hooks:

     downstream      Connects to the RFC 1490 peer entity.

     ethernet        Transmits and receives bridged raw Ethernet frames,
                     without a checksum.

     inet            Transmits and receives raw IP frames.

     ppp             Transmits and receives PPP frames.

CONTROL MESSAGES
     This node type supports the generic control messages, plus the following:

     NGM_RFC1490_SET_ENCAP (setencap)
          This command sets encapsulation method for the node.  The desired
          method must be passed as a string message argument, and must be one
          of the following supported encapsulation modes:

          "ietf-ip"         IP packets are sent using simple RFC1490/2427
                            encapsulation.

          "ietf-snap"       IP packets are sent inside SNAP frames.  Also
                            conforms to RFC1490/2427.

          "cisco"           IP packets are sent and received using proprietary
                            Cisco encapsulation method.

     NGM_RFC1490_GET_ENCAP (getencap)
          This command returns current encapsulation method on the node.

SHUTDOWN
     This node shuts down upon receipt of a NGM_SHUTDOWN control message, or
     when all hooks have been disconnected.
