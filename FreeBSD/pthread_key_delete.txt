PTHREAD_KEY_DELETE(3)  FreeBSD Library Functions Manual  PTHREAD_KEY_DELETE(3)

NAME
     pthread_key_delete – delete a thread-specific data key

LIBRARY
     POSIX Threads Library (libpthread, -lpthread)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <pthread.h>

     int
     pthread_key_delete(pthread_key_t key);

DESCRIPTION
     The pthread_key_delete() function deletes a thread-specific data key
     previously returned by pthread_key_create().  The thread-specific data
     values associated with key need not be NULL at the time that
     pthread_key_delete() is called.  It is the responsibility of the
     application to free any application storage or perform any cleanup
     actions for data structures related to the deleted key or associated
     thread-specific data in any threads; this cleanup can be done either
     before or after pthread_key_delete() is called.  Any attempt to use key
     following the call to pthread_key_delete() results in undefined behavior.

     The pthread_key_delete() function is callable from within destructor
     functions.  Destructor functions are not invoked by pthread_key_delete().
     Any destructor function that may have been associated with key will no
     longer be called upon thread exit.

RETURN VALUES
     If successful, the pthread_key_delete() function will return zero.
     Otherwise an error number will be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     The pthread_key_delete() function will fail if:

     [EINVAL]           The key value is invalid.

SEE ALSO
     pthread_getspecific(3), pthread_key_create(3), pthread_setspecific(3)

STANDARDS
     The pthread_key_delete() function conforms to ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996
     (“POSIX.1”).
