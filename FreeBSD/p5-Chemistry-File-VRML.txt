Chemistry::File::VRML(3)                   User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Chemistry::File::VRML - Generate VRML models for molecules

SYNOPSIS
           use Chemistry::File::PDB;
           use Chemistry::File::VRML;
           use Chemistry::Bond::Find 'find_bonds';

           my $mol = Chemistry::Mol->read('test.pdb');
           find_bonds($mol, orders => 1);
           $mol->write('test.wrl', format => 'vrml',
               center => 1,
               style  => 'ballAndWire',
               color  => 'byAtom',
           );

DESCRIPTION
       This module generates a VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language)
       representation of a molecule, which can then be visualized with any
       VRML viewer. This is a PerlMol file I/O plugin, and registers the
       'vrml' format with Chemistry::Mol. Note however that this file plugin
       is write-only; there's no way of reading a VRML file back into a
       molecule.

       This module is a modification of PDB2VRML by Horst Vollhardt, adapted
       to the Chemistry::File interface.

   OPTIONS
       The following options may be passed to $mol->write.

       center
           If true, shift the molecules center of geometry into the origin of
           the coordinate system. Note: this only affects the output; it does
           not affect the coordinates of the atoms in the original
           Chemistry::Mol object.

       style
           Sets the style for the VRML representation of the molecular
           structure.  Default is 'Wireframe'. Currently supported styles are:

               Wireframe, BallAndWire,
               Stick, BallAndStick,
               CPK

       color
           Set the overall color of the molecular structure. If the color is
           set to 'byAtom', the color the for atoms and bonds is defined by
           the atom type. Default is 'byAtom'. Currently supported colors are:

               byAtom,
               yellow, blue, red,
               green, white, brown,
               grey, purple

       stick_radius
           Defines the radius in Angstrom for the cylinders in the 'Stick' and
           'BallAndStick' style. Default is 0.15 .

       ball_radius
           Defines the factor which is multiplied with the VDW radius for the
           spheres in the 'BallAndWire' and 'BallAndStick' style. Default is
           0.2 .

       compression
           Turns on/off compression of the output. If turned on, all leading
           whitespaces are removed. This produces a less readable but approx.
           20% smaller output, the speed is increased by 10% as well.
