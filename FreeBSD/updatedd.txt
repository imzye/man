NAME
       updatedd-wrapper - config- and cachefile support for updatedd

SYNOPSIS
       updatedd-wrapper [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       Updatedd-wrapper is a perl program to execute updatedd. It uses a
       configuration file with c-like syntax and a cache file for ip addresses
       to prevent that a update with the same address will be executed twice.

OPTIONS
       -c <path>
              Use an alternative configuration file.
              Defaults:
              /etc/updatedd-wrapper.conf
              /usr/etc/updatedd-wrapper.conf
              /usr/local/etc/updatedd-wrapper.conf

       -f     Force update of all records (do not check cached ip addresses).

       -i <secs>
              Wait n seconds after a failed update until a new attempt will be
              tried.

       -r <num>
              Number of retries when an update failed.  This is only for
              updates that failed with return code 1 (warnings), for example
              connection problems or not enough memory.

       -s     Print commands to stdout instead of executing updatedd.  This
              option may be used to check whether updatedd-wrapper reads the
              configuration file correctly.

       -t <path>
              Usually /tmp/updatedd-wrapper-<uid>.cache will be used as cache-
              file, but you can specify another one with this option.

       -y     Print update status of all accounts to syslog.  The
              configuration in updatedd-wrapper.conf will be passed over.

       --help Print help and exit.

       --version
              Print version information and exit.
