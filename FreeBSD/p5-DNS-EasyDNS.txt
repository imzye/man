NAME
       DNS::EasyDNS - Update your EasyDNS dynamic DNS entries

SYNOPSIS
               use DNS::EasyDNS;
               my $ed = DNS::EasyDNS->new;
               $ed->update( username => "foo", password => "bar" ) || die "Failed: $@";

DESCRIPTION
       This module allows you to update your EasyDNS ( http://www.easydns.com/
       ) dynamic DNS records. This is done via an http get using the libwww-
       perl modules.

METHODS
       DNS::EasyDNS->new();
           Create a new EasyDNS object. This is actually an inheritted
           LWP::UserAgent so you may like to use some of the UserAgent
           methods. For example, if you are behind a proxy server:

                   $ed->proxy('http', 'http://proxy.sn.no:8001/');

       $ed->update(%args);
           Updates your EasyDNS dynamic DNS records. Valid %args are:

                   "username" - Your EasyDNS login name. This is required.

                   "password" - The corresponding password. This is required.

                   "hostname" - The full host being updated. This is required.

                   "tld" - The root domain of your hostname, for example if
                   your hostname is "example.co.uk" you should set "tld" to
                   "co.uk".

                   "myip" - The IP address of the client to be updated. Use
                   "0.0.0.0" to set record to an offline state (sets record to
                   "offline.easydns.com"). This defaults to the IP address of
                   the incoming connection (handy if you are being natted).

                   "mx" - Use this parameter as the MX handler for the domain
                   being updated, it defaults to preference 5.

                   "backmx" - Values are either "YES" or "NO", if "YES" we set
                   smtp.easydns.com to be a backup mail spool for domain being
                   updated at preference 100.

                   "wildcard" - Values are either "ON" or "OFF", if "ON" sets
                   a wildcard host record for the domain being updated equal
                   to the IP address specified in "myip".

                   "secure" - Values are either 1 or 0. If 1, then SSL https
                   is used to connect to EasyDNS. The SSL connection has the
                   big advantage that your passwords are not passed in plain-
                   text accross the internet. Secure is on by default if
                   Crypt::SSLeay is installed. A warning will be generated if
                   it's not installed, unless you set "secure =" 0>. If you
                   set "secure =" 1> and the module is unavailable, the module
                   will "croak".

           The function returns "TRUE" of success. On failure it returns
           "FALSE" and sets $@.

       DNS::EasyDNS->get_basic_credentials();
           Since EasyDNS object is an inheritted LWP::UserAgent, it overrides
           this UserAgent method for your convenience. It uses the credentials
           passed in the constructor. There is no real reason to override, or
           call this.

                   sub get_basic_credentials { ($_[0]->{"username"}, $_[0]->{"password"}) }

NOTES
       There are some example scripts in the "examples" directory of the
       module distribution. These are designed to run out of cron (or
       similar). You should not run them to often to avoid overloading the
       EasyDNS servers (in fact EasyDNS will not respond to similar reqests
       less that 10 minutes apart). Ideally your code should cache the
       existing value for your IP, and only update EasyDNS when it changes.

BUGS
       None known
