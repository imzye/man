Devel::Caller::Perl(3)                     User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Devel::Caller::Perl - Perl only implementation.

SYNOPSIS
        use Devel::Caller::Perl qw[called_args];

        sub permute_args {
          my @args = @_;
          my @caller_args = called_args( 0 );

          my %caller_args =
            map { $_ => $caller_args[$_] } 0 .. $#caller_args;

          return \%caller_args;
        }

        sub dodad {
          my $args = permute_args;

          print $args->{0};
          # ...
        }

ABSTRACT
       This module allows a method to get at arguments passed to subroutines
       higher up in the call stack.

DESCRIPTION
   FUNCTIONS
       called_args [LEVEL]

       "called_args" returns the arguments to the subroutine at LEVEL in the
       call stack.  If no level is specified, 0 (zero) is assumed, that being
       our caller.  If a list is expected, it will be returned.  When a scalar
       is expected, a list reference will be returned.

       If you want the number of arguments passed to the subroutine at LEVEL,
       there's nothing stopping you from getting it from "caller".

        my $number = (caller $level)[4];
