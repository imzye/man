NAME
     Adobe Utopia Typeface – fonts for GNU Troff

SYNOPSIS
     groff -F/usr/local/share/utopia

DESCRIPTION
     The print/utopia port installs the files needed to use the PostScript
     Type 1 version of the Adobe Utopia typeface with GNU Troff, as it is
     configured in a FreeBSD basic install.

USAGE
     The port installs the fonts and support files in /usr/local/share/utopia.
     To get Groff to see the fonts, one must either employ that program's -F
     option to specify this directory, or one must set the GROFF_FONT_PATH
     environment variable.

     The fonts are named in Groff as follows.

         Groff Font Name    Font
         UR                 Utopia Roman
         UI                 Utopia Italic
         UB                 Utopia Bold
         UBI                Utopia Bold Italic

     One may employ the ".fam U" command to set the current family to Utopia.

LICENSE
     The fonts are released under a royalty-free licence, a copy of which may
     be found in

     /usr/local/share/utopia/devps/LICENSE

     Adobe Utopia was originally designed by Robert Slimbach and released
     commercially by Adobe Systems Incorporated in 1989.  In 1992, Adobe
     contributed the typeface to the X Consortium for distribution with the X
     Window System, under a license allowing redistribution without fee.  In
     2006, Adobe re-licensed the Type 1 versions to the TeX Users Group under
     an expanded license clarifying the terms under which modified versions
     may be distributed, and granting the right to sub-license.  TUG in turn
     sub-licensed all their rights to the typeface to any and all interested
     parties.

     Note that this license applies only to the original PostScript Type 1
     versions of Adobe Utopia.  Adobe has since released a new commercial
     version of Utopia in OpenType format, to which this license does not
     apply.
