           if ($pid == 0) {
               # child
               ok 1, "child $_" for 1..100;
           } elsif ($pid) {
               # parent
               ok 1, "parent $_" for 1..100;

DESCRIPTION
       Test::SharedFork is utility module for Test::Builder.

       This module makes fork(2) safety in your test case.

       This module merges test count with parent process & child process.

LIMITATIONS
       This version of the Test::SharedFork does not support ithreads, because
       threads::shared conflicts with Storable.
