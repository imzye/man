SYNOPSYS

       only level 0 (default, no debugging) and 1 (debugging enabled) are
       supported.  The second argument where specifies if debug output should
       be written to stdout using HTML (1), to stderr as plain text (0,
       default), or to syslog (2).

       This shoud be the first one called from the CGI library.
