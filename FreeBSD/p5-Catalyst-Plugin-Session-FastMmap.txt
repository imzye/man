NAME
       Catalyst::Plugin::Session::FastMmap - [DEPRECATED] FastMmap sessions
       for Catalyst

DEPRECATION
       Note that this module is deprecated in favor of
       Catalyst::Plugin::Session.

       It works under Catalyst 5.5, but might not work in future versions.
       Using Catalyst::Plugin::Session should be a small change, since the API
       is mostly backwards compatible.

SYNOPSIS
           use Catalyst 'Session::FastMmap';

           MyApp->config->{session} = {
               expires => 3600,
               rewrite => 1,
               storage => '/tmp/session'
           };

           $c->session->{foo} = 'bar';
           print $c->sessionid;

DESCRIPTION
       "Catalyst::Plugin::Session::FastMmap" is a fast session plugin for
       Catalyst that uses an mmap'ed file to act as a shared memory
       interprocess cache.  It is based on "Cache::FastMMap".

   EXTENDED METHODS
       finalize
       prepare_action
       setup
           Sets up the session cache file.

   METHODS
       session
       uri Extends an uri with session id if needed.

               my $uri = $c->uri('http://localhost/foo');

   CONFIG OPTIONS
       rewrite
           If set to a true value sessions are automatically stored in the
           url; defaults to false.

       storage
           Specifies the file to be used for the sharing of session data;
           defaults to "/tmp/session".

           Note that the file will be created with mode 0640, which means that
           it will only be writeable by processes running with the same uid as
           the process that creates the file.  If this may be a problem, for
           example if you may try to debug the program as one user and run it
           as another, specify a filename like "/tmp/session-$>", which
           includes the UID of the process in the filename.

       expires
           Specifies the session expiry time in seconds; defaults to 86,400,
           i.e. one day.
