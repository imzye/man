NAME
       jumpgate -- a TCP connection forwarder

SYNOPSIS
       jumpgate [-hsvi] [-b local_host] [-l local_port] [-r remote_port] [-a
       remote_host] [-f filename] [-c number_of_connections] [-L microseconds]

DESCRIPTION
       jumpgate is a TCP connection forwarder that provides many enhancements
       and improvements over the existing programs that do the same thing.

       jumpgate provides an interactive mode that queries the connected party
       for the forwarding information it needs.  Also, there is the option to
       log the entire forwarded session in a file for later inspection.
       Furthermore, it can log information about the forwarded session via the
       syslog(3) facility.

OPTIONS
       -h     Output a help message that describes in brief the usage of each
              option.

       -s     Enable logging of the forwarding information via syslog(3).

       -v     Display version number and exit.

       -i     Enable interactive mode.  When interactive mode is enabled, only
              the local port argument is obligatory, since the connected party
              is queried about the rest needed forwarding information.

       -b local_host
              Specify the local IP to bind.

       -l local_port
              Specify the local port to listen on.  A port number or a service
              name can be specified.

       -r remote_port
              Specify the remote port to forward the connection to.  A port
              number or a service name can be specified.

       -a remote_host
              Specify the remote host or IP address to forward the connection
              to.

       -f filename
              Specify the filename to log the entire forwarded session.  In
              interactive mode it logs every forwarded connection.

       -c number_of_connections
              Specify the maximum length of the queue of pending connections.

       -L microseconds
              Specify the latency in the forwarded connection in microseconds.
              A microsecond is 0.000001 seconds.

       jumpgate is thoroughly tested on OpenBSD, but should compile and run
       without problems on any Unix-like system with no or trivial
       modifications.  For a list of systems that jumpgate is known to run on
       see the README file.  If you furtherly improve it, please send me the
       diffs.

EXAMPLES
       For example, to forward all the onnections coming to the local machine
       on port 4000 to bsd.gr port 21, and log the connected party via
       syslog(3) one should invoke jumpgate like this:

       jumpgate -s -l 4000 -r 21 -a bsd.gr

       In order to wait for connections on port 4000 on the local machine, and
       then ask the connected party where to forward the connection, while
       logging the entire forwarding session to the jumpgate.log file you
       should do:

       jumpgate -i -l 4000 -f jumpgate.log

BUGS
       jumpgate's interactive mode is still considered to be in beta testing
       phase.  Also, there is no UDP support yet.
