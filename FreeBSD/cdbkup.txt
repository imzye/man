CDAPPEND(1)             FreeBSD General Commands Manual            CDAPPEND(1)

NAME
       cdappend - Copy STDIN onto a CD-R(W).

SYNOPSIS
       cdappend [ -1, --single ] [ -b, --blank ] [ -h, --help ] [ -n,
       --name=NAME ] [ -r, --recycle ] [ -s, --speed=SPEED ] [ -S,
       --cdsize=SIZE ] [ -t, --test ] [ -V, --version ] [ -w, --workdir=PATH ]
       DEVICE

OPTIONS
       -1, --single
              Burn the image in single session mode.  This means that you will
              not be able to append any more images to this disk until the CD
              is blanked (if it's a CD-RW).

       -b, --blank
              Blank disk before writing.  This option may not be used in
              conjunction with --recycle (-r).

       -h, --help
              Show usage message and quit.

       -n, --name=NAME
              Set the filename to be used on the CD.  The default filename is
              'cdbkup'.

       -r, --recycle
              If the image is too large to fit in the available space on the
              disk, but it will still fit on a blank disk, the CD is blanked.
              This option conflicts with --blank.

       -s, --speed=SPEED
              Set the burn speed.  The default is 2.

       -S, --cdsize=SIZE
              Specify the size of the output medium in bytes.  Normally,
              cdappend attempts to autodetect the size of the disk and uses a
              default of 650,000,000 bytes if autodetection fails.  This
              option disables autodetection.

       -t, --test
              Do not use the CD-ROM burner.  In this mode, the backup proceeds
              normally, except that the backup file is saved as an ISO image
              in the current directory instead of being burned onto a CD-R(W).
              If -t is used, the following options are ignored: -1, -b, -r,
              -s.

              The --cdsize option can be used in conjunction with --test to
              specify the maximum size of the ISO image.

       -V, --version
              Print the version number and exit.

       -w, --workdir=PATH
              Set the working directory as specified.  If the directory
              doesn't exist, it will be created.

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the cdappend backup utility.

       CDAppend copies its standard input into a file on the CD-R(W) currently
       in the drive.  It is non-interactive.  If the image will not fit on the
       disk, it prints an error and returns a non-zero status code.

DEVICES
       The device specified on the command line is the SCSI device for the CD-
       ROM burner.  For more information, see cdrecord (1).
