LTTNG-UST-CYG-PROFILE(3)                              LTTNG-UST-CYG-PROFILE(3)

NAME
       lttng-ust-cyg-profile — LTTng UST 2.x Function Tracing

SYNOPSIS
       Compile the application source code with option -finstrument-functions
       and launch your application either with:

       LD_PRELOAD=liblttng-ust-cyg-profile-fast.so appname

       or (to use verbose function tracing)

       LD_PRELOAD=liblttng-ust-cyg-profile.so appname

       All events emitted for function tracing are provided on loglevel
       TRACE_DEBUG_FUNCTION. The following command can be used to add function
       tracing events in your trace session:

       lttng enable-event -u -a --loglevel-only TRACE_DEBUG_FUNCTION

DESCRIPTION
       For compilers that provide code generation option -finstrument-
       functions (e.g. GCC and LLVM/Clang) LTTng-UST provides shared libraries
       that allow users to trace the function flow of their applications.

       Function tracing comes in two flavors (each providing different trade-
       offs):

       liblttng-ust-cyg-profile-fast.so
              This is a lightweight variant that should only be used where it
              can be guaranteed that the complete event stream is recorded
              without any missing events. Any kind of duplicate information is
              left out.

              At each function entry the address of the called function is
              recored as lttng_ust_cyg_profile_fast:func_entry. Function exit
              is recorded as lttng_ust_cyg_profile_fast:func_exit (without any
              field data).


       liblttng-ust-cyg-profile.so
              This is a more robust variant which also works for use-cases
              where events might get discarded or not recorded from
              application startup. In these cases the trace analyzer needs
              extra information to be able to reconstruct the program flow.

              For each function entry and exit the address of the called
              function and the call site address are recorded as
              lttng_ust_cyg_profile:func_entry and
              lttng_ust_cyg_profile:func_exit.

USAGE
       To use function tracing you need to make sure the sources of your
       application are compiled with -finstrument-functions. It might be
       necessary to limit the number of source files where this option is used
       to prevent excessive amount of trace data to be generated during run
       time. Usually there are additional compiler flags that allow you to
       specify more fine grained selection of function instrumentation.

       For each instrumented function the executable will contain calls to
       profiling function hooks (after function entry and just before function
       exit).

       By preloading (LD_PRELOAD) one of the provided shared libraries, these
       profiling hooks get defined to emit LTTng events (as described above).

       Using this feature can result in massive amount trace data to be
       generated by the instrumented application. Application runtime is also
       considerably affected. Be careful on systems with limited resources.
