Catalyst::DispatchType::LocalRegex(3)      User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Catalyst::DispatchType::LocalRegex - LocalRegex DispatchType

SYNOPSIS
       See Catalyst::DispatchType.

DESCRIPTION
       Status: Deprecated. Regex dispatch types have been deprecated and
       removed from Catalyst core. It is recommend that you use Chained
       methods or other techniques instead. As part of the refactoring, the
       dispatch priority of Regex vs Regexp vs LocalRegex vs LocalRegexp may
       have changed. Priority is now influenced by when the dispatch type is
       first seen in your application.

       When loaded, a warning about the deprecation will be printed to STDERR.
       To suppress the warning set the CATALYST_NOWARN_DEPRECATE environment
       variable to a true value.

       Dispatch type managing path-matching behaviour using regexes.  For more
       information on dispatch types, see:

       •   Catalyst::Manual::Intro for how they affect application authors

       •   Catalyst::DispatchType for implementation information.
