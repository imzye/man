SPRAY(8)                FreeBSD System Manager's Manual               SPRAY(8)

NAME
     spray – send many packets to host

SYNOPSIS
     spray [-c count] [-d delay] [-l length] host

DESCRIPTION
     The spray utility sends multiple RPC packets to host and records how many
     of them were correctly received and how long it took.

     The options are as follows:

     -c count
             Send count packets.

     -d delay
             Pause delay microseconds between sending each packet.

     -l length
             Set the length of the packet that holds the RPC call message to
             length bytes.  Not all values of length are possible because RPC
             data is encoded using XDR.  The spray utility rounds up to the
             nearest possible value.

     The spray utility is intended for use in network testing, measurement,
     and management.  This command can be very hard on a network and should be
     used with caution.
