NAME
       HTTP::Recorder - record interaction with websites

SYNOPSIS
   This module is deprecated
       It works by tagging links in a page, and then when a link is clicked
       looking on the submitted tag to see which link was clicked

       It can not handle Javascript-created links or JS manipulation of the
       page so it works only for fairly static websites

       For better options check out Selenium

       Patchs are welcome, and I'll fix bugs as much as I can, but please
       don't expect me to implement new features

   Using HTTP::Recorder as a Web Proxy
       Set HTTP::Recorder as the user agent for a proxy, and it rewrites HTTP
       responses so that additional requests can be recorded.

       The Proxy Script

       For quick start, run the httprecorder script

           httprecorder

       This will open a local proxy on port 8080, and will dump the recorded
       traffic to a file named http_traffic in the current directory. use the
       -help parameter for usage info

       Start the proxy script, then change the settings in your web browser so
       that it will use this proxy for web requests.  For more information
       about proxy settings and the default port, see HTTP::Proxy.

       The script will be recorded in the specified file, and can be viewed
       and modified via the control panel.

       For better control, use this example:

           #!/usr/bin/perl

           use HTTP::Proxy;
           use HTTP::Recorder;

           my $proxy = HTTP::Proxy->new();

           # create a new HTTP::Recorder object
           my $agent = new HTTP::Recorder;

           # set the log file (optional)
           $agent->file("/tmp/myfile");

           # set HTTP::Recorder as the agent for the proxy
           $proxy->agent( $agent );

           # start the proxy
           $proxy->start();

       Start Recording

       Now you can use your browser as your normally would, and your actions
       will be recorded in the file you specified.  Alternatively, you can
       start recording from the Control Panel.

       Using the Control Panel

       If you have Javascript enabled in your browser, go to the
       HTTP::Recorder control URL (http://http-recorder by default),
       optionally type a URL into the "Goto page" field, and click "Go".

       In the new window, interact with web sites as you normally do,
       including typing a new address into the address field.  The Control
       Panel will be updated after each recorded action.

       The Control Panel allows you to modify, delete, or save your script.

   SSL sessions
       As of version 0.03, HTTP::Recorder can record SSL sessions.

       To begin recording an SSL session, go to the control URL
       (http://http-recorder/ by default), and enter the initial URL.  Then,
       interact with the web site as usual.

   Script output
       By default, HTTP::Recorder outputs WWW::Mechanize scripts.

       However, you can override HTTP::Recorder::Logger to output other types
       of scripts.

Functions
   new
       Creates and returns a new HTTP::Recorder object, referred to as the
       'agent'.

   $agent->prefix([$value])
       Get or set the prefix string that HTTP::Recorder uses for rewriting
       responses.

   $agent->control([$value])
       Get or set the URL of the control panel.  By default, the control URL
       is 'http-recorder'.

       The control URL will display a control panel which will allow you to
       view and edit the current script.

   $agent->logger([$value])
       Get or set the logger object.  The default logger is a
       HTTP::Recorder::Logger, which generates WWW::Mechanize scripts.

   $agent->ignore_favicon([0|1])
       Get or set ignore_favicon flag that causes HTTP::Recorder to skip
       logging requests favicon.ico files.  The value is 1 by default.

   $agent->file([$value])
       Get or set the filename for generated scripts.  The default is
       '/tmp/scriptfile'.

Bugs, Missing Features, and other Oddities
   Javascript
       WWW::Mechanize can't play back Javascript actions, and HTTP::Recorder
       doesn't record them.

   Why are my images corrupted?
       HTTP::Recorder only tries to rewrite responses that are of type text/*,
       which it determines by reading the Content-Type header of the
       HTTP::Response object.  However, if the received image gives the wrong
       Content-Type header, it may be corrupted by the recorder.  While this
       may not be pleasant to look at, it shouldn't have an effect on your
       recording session.

       If you're submitting a bug of the type "X doesn't record correctly," be
       sure to include a (preferably short and simple) HTML page that
       demonstrates the problem, and a clear explanation of a) what it does
       that it shouldn't, and b) what it should do instead.
