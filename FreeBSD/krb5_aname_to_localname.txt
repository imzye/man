KRB5_ANAME_TO_LOCALNAME(3)                    FreeBSD Library Functions Manual

NAME
     krb5_aname_to_localname – converts a principal to a system local name

LIBRARY
     Kerberos 5 Library (libkrb5, -lkrb5)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <krb5.h>

     krb5_boolean
     krb5_aname_to_localname(krb5_context context, krb5_const_principal name,
         size_t lnsize, char *lname);

DESCRIPTION
     This function takes a principal name, verifies that it is in the local
     realm (using krb5_get_default_realms()) and then returns the local name
     of the principal.

     If name isn't in one of the local realms an error is returned.

     If the size (lnsize) of the local name (lname) is too small, an error is
     returned.

     krb5_aname_to_localname() should only be use by an application that
     implements protocols that don't transport the login name and thus needs
     to convert a principal to a local name.

     Protocols should be designed so that they authenticate using Kerberos,
     send over the login name and then verify the principal that is
     authenticated is allowed to login and the login name.  A way to check if
     a user is allowed to login is using the function krb5_kuserok().
