NAME
       skopeo-copy - Copy an image (manifest, filesystem layers, signatures)
       from one location to another.


SYNOPSIS
       skopeo copy [options] source-image destination-image


DESCRIPTION
       Copy an image (manifest, filesystem layers, signatures) from one
       location to another.


       Uses the system's trust policy to validate images, rejects images not
       trusted by the policy.


       source-image use the "image name" format described above


       destination-image use the "image name" format described above


       source-image and destination-image are interpreted completely
       independently; e.g. the destination name does not automatically inherit
       any parts of the source name.


OPTIONS
       See also skopeo(1) for options placed before the subcommand name.


       --additional-tag=strings


       Additional tags (supports docker-archive).


       --all, -a


       If source-image refers to a list of images, instead of copying just the
       image which matches the current OS and architecture (subject to the use
       of the global --override-os, --override-arch and --override-variant
       options), attempt to copy all of the images in the list, and the list
       itself.


       --authfile path


       Path of the authentication file. Default is
       ${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json, which is set using skopeo
       login.  If the authorization state is not found there,
       $HOME/.docker/config.json is checked, which is set using docker login.


       Note: You can also override the default path of the authentication file
       by setting the REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE environment variable. export
       REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE=path


       --src-authfile path


       Path of the authentication file for the source registry. Uses path
       given by --authfile, if not provided.


       --dest-authfile path


       Path of the authentication file for the destination registry. Uses path
       given by --authfile, if not provided.


       --dest-shared-blob-dir directory


       Directory to use to share blobs across OCI repositories.


       --digestfile path


       After copying the image, write the digest of the resulting image to the
       file.


       --preserve-digests


       Preserve the digests during copying. Fail if the digest cannot be
       preserved.


       This option does not change what will be copied; consider using --all
       at the same time.


       --encrypt-layer ints


       Experimental the 0-indexed layer indices, with support for negative
       indexing (e.g. 0 is the first layer, -1 is the last layer)


       --format, -f manifest-type


       MANIFEST TYPE (oci, v2s1, or v2s2) to use in the destination (default
       is manifest type of source, with fallbacks)


       --help, -h


       Print usage statement


       --multi-arch option


       Control what is copied if source-image refers to a multi-architecture
       image. Default is system.


       Options: - system: Copy only the image that matches the system
       architecture - all: Copy the full multi-architecture image - index-
       only: Copy only the index


       The index-only option usually fails unless the referenced per-
       architecture images are already present in the destination, or the
       target registry supports sparse indexes.


       --quiet, -q


       Suppress output information when copying images.


       --remove-signatures


       Do not copy signatures, if any, from source-image. Necessary when
       copying a signed image to a destination which does not support
       signatures.


       --sign-by key-id


       Add a “simple signing” signature using that key ID for an image name
       corresponding to destination-image


       --sign-by-sigstore param-file


       Add a sigstore signature based on the options in the specified
       containers sigstore signing parameter file, param-file.  See
       containers-sigstore-signing-params.yaml(5) for details about the file
       format.


       --sign-by-sigstore-private-key path


       Add a sigstore signature using a private key at path for an image name
       corresponding to destination-image


       --sign-passphrase-file path


       The passphare to use when signing with --sign-by or --sign-by-sigstore-
       private-key. Only the first line will be read. A passphrase stored in a
       file is of questionable security if other users can read this file. Do
       not use this option if at all avoidable.


       --sign-identity reference


       The identity to use when signing the image. The identity must be a
       fully specified docker reference. If the identity is not specified, the
       target docker reference will be used.


       --src-shared-blob-dir directory


       Directory to use to share blobs across OCI repositories.


       --encryption-key protocol:keyfile


       Specifies the encryption protocol, which can be JWE (RFC7516), PGP
       (RFC4880), and PKCS7 (RFC2315) and the key material required for image
       encryption. For instance, jwe:/path/to/key.pem or pgp:admin@example.com
       or pkcs7:/path/to/x509-file.


       --decryption-key key[:passphrase]


       Key to be used for decryption of images. Key can point to keys and/or
       certificates. Decryption will be tried with all keys. If the key is
       protected by a passphrase, it is required to be passed in the argument
       and omitted otherwise.


       --src-creds username[:password]


       Credentials for accessing the source registry.


       --dest-compress


       Compress tarball image layers when saving to directory using the 'dir'
       transport. (default is same compression type as source).


       --dest-decompress


       Decompress tarball image layers when saving to directory using the
       'dir' transport. (default is same compression type as source).


       --dest-oci-accept-uncompressed-layers


       Allow uncompressed image layers when saving to an OCI image using the
       'oci' transport. (default is to compress things that aren't
       compressed).


       --dest-creds username[:password]


       Credentials for accessing the destination registry.


       --src-cert-dir path


       Use certificates at path (*.crt, *.cert, *.key) to connect to the
       source registry or daemon.


       --src-no-creds


       Access the registry anonymously.


       --src-tls-verify=bool


       Require HTTPS and verify certificates when talking to container source
       registry or daemon. Default to source registry setting.


       --dest-cert-dir path


       Use certificates at path (*.crt, *.cert, *.key) to connect to the
       destination registry or daemon.


       --dest-no-creds


       Access the registry anonymously.


       --dest-tls-verify=bool


       Require HTTPS and verify certificates when talking to container
       destination registry or daemon. Default to destination registry
       setting.


       --src-daemon-host host


       Copy from docker daemon at host. If host starts with tcp://, HTTPS is
       enabled by default. To use plain HTTP, use the form http:// (default is
       unix:///var/run/docker.sock).


       --dest-daemon-host host


       Copy to docker daemon at host. If host starts with tcp://, HTTPS is
       enabled by default. To use plain HTTP, use the form http:// (default is
       unix:///var/run/docker.sock).


       Existing signatures, if any, are preserved as well.


       --dest-compress-format format


       Specifies the compression format to use.  Supported values are: gzip,
       zstd and zstd:chunked.  zstd:chunked is incompatible with encrypting
       images, and will be treated as zstd with a warning in that case.


       --dest-compress-level format


       Specifies the compression level to use.  The value is specific to the
       compression algorithm used, e.g. for zstd the accepted values are in
       the range 1-20 (inclusive), while for gzip it is 1-9 (inclusive).


       --src-registry-token token


       Bearer token for accessing the source registry.


       --dest-registry-token token


       Bearer token for accessing the destination registry.


       --dest-precompute-digests


       Precompute digests to ensure layers are not uploaded that already exist
       on the destination registry. Layers with initially unknown digests (ex.
       compressing "on the fly") will be temporarily streamed to disk.


       --retry-times


       The number of times to retry.


       --retry-delay


       Fixed delay between retries. If not set (or set to 0s), retry wait time
       will be exponentially increased based on the number of failed attempts.


       --src-username


       The username to access the source registry.


       --src-password


       The password to access the source registry.


       --dest-username


       The username to access the destination registry.


       --dest-password


       The password to access the destination registry.


       --image-parallel-copies n


       Maximum number of image layers to be copied (pulled/pushed)
       simultaneously. Not setting this field will fall back to
       containers/image defaults.


EXAMPLES
       To just copy an image from one registry to another:

       $ skopeo copy docker://quay.io/skopeo/stable:latest docker://registry.example.com/skopeo:latest


       To copy the layers of the docker.io busybox image to a local directory:

       $ mkdir -p /var/lib/images/busybox
       $ skopeo copy docker://busybox:latest dir:/var/lib/images/busybox
       $ ls /var/lib/images/busybox/*
         /tmp/busybox/2b8fd9751c4c0f5dd266fcae00707e67a2545ef34f9a29354585f93dac906749.tar
         /tmp/busybox/manifest.json
         /tmp/busybox/8ddc19f16526912237dd8af81971d5e4dd0587907234be2b83e249518d5b673f.tar


       To create an archive consumable by docker load (but note that using a
       registry is almost always more efficient):

       $ skopeo copy docker://busybox:latest docker-archive:archive-file.tar:busybox:latest


       To copy and sign an image:

       $ skopeo copy --sign-by dev@example.com containers-storage:example/busybox:streaming docker://example/busybox:gold


       To encrypt an image:

       $ skopeo copy docker://docker.io/library/nginx:1.17.8 oci:local_nginx:1.17.8

       $ openssl genrsa -out private.key 1024
       $ openssl rsa -in private.key -pubout > public.key

       $ skopeo copy --encryption-key jwe:./public.key oci:local_nginx:1.17.8 oci:try-encrypt:encrypted


       To decrypt an image:

       $ skopeo copy --decryption-key ./private.key oci:try-encrypt:encrypted oci:try-decrypt:decrypted


       To copy encrypted image without decryption:

       $ skopeo copy oci:try-encrypt:encrypted oci:try-encrypt-copy:encrypted


       To decrypt an image that requires more than one key:

       $ skopeo copy --decryption-key ./private1.key --decryption-key ./private2.key --decryption-key ./private3.key oci:try-encrypt:encrypted oci:try-decrypt:decrypted


       Container images can also be partially encrypted by specifying the
       index of the layer. Layers are 0-indexed indices, with support for
       negative indexing. i.e. 0 is the first layer, -1 is the last layer.


       Let's say out of 3 layers that the image docker.io/library/nginx:1.17.8
       is made up of, we only want to encrypt the 2nd layer,

       $ skopeo copy --encryption-key jwe:./public.key --encrypt-layer 1 oci:local_nginx:1.17.8 oci:try-encrypt:encrypted
