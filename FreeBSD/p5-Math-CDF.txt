NAME
       Math::CDF - Generate probabilities and quantiles from several
       statistical probability functions

SYNOPSIS
       use Math::CDF;

       $prob = &Math::CDF::pnorm(1.96);

       "if( not defined($z = &Math::CDF::qnorm(0.975)) )" {
           die "qnorm() failed"; }

       or

       use Math::CDF qw(:all);

       $prob = pnorm(1.96);

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a perl interface to the DCDFLIB. See the section
       on DCDFLIB for more information.

       Functions are available for 7 continuous distributions (Beta, Chi-
       square, F, Gamma, Normal, Poisson and T-distribution) and for two
       discrete distributions (Binomial and Negative Binomial). Optional non-
       centrality parameters are available for the Chi-square, F and
       T-distributions. Cumulative probabilities are available for all 9
       distributions and quantile functions are available for the 7 continuous
       distributions.

       All cumulative probability function names begin with the character "p".
       They give the probability of being less than or equal to the given
       value [ "P(X <= x)" ]

       All quantile function names begin with the character q. They give a
       value of x such that "P(X <= x)" = p where the value of p is provided
       to the function.

       Non-centrality parameters are always the last function argument when
       available. You do not need to supply the non-centrality parameter in
       which case it will be assumed to be 0.

       All functions will return an undefined value if the function fails
       (probably due to parameters being out of allowed range) but will not
       otherwise generate an error message. The user should check for valid
       output from the Math::CDF functions with the defined() function as
       demonstrated in the SYNOPSIS section.

FUNCTION DESCRIPTIONS
       In all, 16 functions are available via Math::CDF:

           pbeta(), qbeta()          [Beta Distribution]
           pchisq(), qchisq()        [Chi-square Distribution]
           pf(), qf()                [F Distribution]
           pgamma(), qgamma()        [Gamma Distribution]
           pnorm(), qnorm()          [Standard Normal Dist]
           ppois(), qpois()          [Poisson Distribution]
           pt(), qt()                [T-distribution]
           pbinom()                  [Binomial Distribution]
           pnbinom()                 [Negative Binomial Distribution]

       "pbeta($x, $a, $b), qbeta($p, $a, $b)"
           Generates cumulative probabilities and quantiles from the Beta
           distribution.  $x should be in the range of [0,1] and $p should be
           in [0,1].  $a and $b are parameters of the beta distribution.  Both
           $a and $b must be in the range [0,Inf).

       "pchisq($x, $df, $ncp), qbeta($p, $df, $ncp)"
           Generates cumulative probabilities and quantiles from the Chi-
           square distribution.  $x should be in the range of [0,Inf) and $p
           should be in [0,1].  $df is the degrees of freedom of the
           distribution and must be in the range (0,Inf).  $ncp is the
           optional non-centrality parameter and must be in the range [0,Inf).
           The non-centrality parameter need not be specified and the calls
           "pchisq(5, 5, 0.0)" and "pchisq(5, 5)" will return identical
           values.

       "pf($x, $dfn, $dfd, $ncp), qf($p, $dfn, $dfd, $ncp)"
           Generates cumulative probabilities and quantiles from the F
           distribution.  $x should be in the range of [0,Inf) and $p should
           be in [0,1].  $dfn and $dfd are the numerator and denominator
           degrees of freedom, respectively. Both must be in the range
           (0,Inf).  $ncp is the optional non-centrality parameter and must be
           in the range [0,Inf).  The non-centrality parameter need not be
           specified and the calls [CS]<pf(5, 2, 3, 0.0)> and [CS]<pf(5, 2,
           3)> will return identical values.

       "pgamma($x, $shape, $scale), qgamma($p, $shape, $scale)"
           Generates cumulative probabilities and quantiles from the Gamma
           distribution. The gamma density is proportional to [CS]<$x**($shape
           - 1) * EXP(- $scale * $x)> $x should be in the range of [0,Inf) and
           $p should be in [0,1].  $shape and $scale are parameters of the
           Gamma distribution and both must be in the range (0,Inf).

       "pnorm($x), qnorm($p)"
           Generates cumulative probabilities and quantiles from the standard
           Normal distribution.  $x should be in the range of (-Inf,Inf) and
           $p should be in [0,1].

       "ppois($x, $lambda), qpois($p, $lambda)"
           Generates cumulative probabilities and quantiles from the Poisson
           distribution.  $x should be in the range of [0,Inf) and $p should
           be in [0,1].  $lambda is the parameter of the Poisson distribution
           and must be in the range [0,Inf).

       "pt($x, $df, $ncp), qt($p, $df, $ncp)"
           Generates cumulative probabilities and quantiles from the T
           distribution.  $x should be in the range of (-Inf,Inf) and $p
           should be in [0,1].  $df is the degree of freedom of the
           distribution and must be in the range (0,Inf).  $ncp is the
           optional non-centrality parameter and must be in the range
           (-Inf,Inf).  The non-centrality parameter need not be specified and
           the calls [CS]<pt(0, 3, 0.0)> and [CS]<pt(0, 3)> will return
           identical values.

       "pbinom($x, $n, $p)"
           Generates cumulative probabilities from the Binomial distribution.
           This is the probability of having $x or fewer successes in $n
           trials when each trial has a $p probability of success.  $x should
           be in the range of [0,$n], $n should be in the range (0,Inf) and $p
           should be in [0,1].

       "pnbinom($x, $n, $p)"
           Generates cumulative probabilities from the Negative Binomial
           distribution.  The is the probability of having $x or fewer
           failures before the $n'th success when each trial has a $p
           probability of success.  $x should be in the range of [0,Inf), $n
           should be in the range (0,Inf) and $p should be in [0,1].

DCDFLIB
       DCDFLIB is a library of C routines for cumulative distribution
       functions, inverses, and other parameters written by Barry W. Brown,
       James Lovato and Kathy Russell of the Department of Biomathematics at
       The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston Texas.

       Version 1.1 of DCDFLIB is included with this distribution and can be
       downloaded via ftp from odin.mda.uth.tmc.edu as
       /pub/src/dcdflib.c-1.1.tar.gz.  The library is also available in
       Fortran source.

       Documentation for DCDFLIB is found in the cdflib/doc/ directory of the
       source distribution of Math::CDF

       DCDFLIB has been put in the public domain. However, some of the
       Algorithms are from the ACM publication and is under their copyright.
       Generally this means that those algorithms can be distributed and used
       freely for non-commercial purposes. See the file cdflib/doc/README in
       the source distribution of Math::CDF for more information.
