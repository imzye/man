SYNOPSIS
          bt_name_format * bt_create_name_format (char * parts,
                                                  boolean abbrev_first);

                                      bt_joinmethod join_part);
          char * bt_format_name (bt_name * name, bt_name_format * format);

DESCRIPTION
       After splitting a name into its components parts (represented as a
       "bt_name" structure), you often want to put it back together again as a
       single string in a consistent way.  btparse provides a very flexible
       way to do this, generally in two stages: first, you create a "name
       format" which describes how to put the tokens and parts of any name
       back together, and then you apply the format to a particular name.

       The "name format" is encapsulated in a "bt_name_format" structure,
       which is created with bt_create_name_format().  This function includes
       some clever trickery that means you can usually get away with calling
       it alone, and not need to do any customization of the format.  If you
       do need to customize the format, though, bt_set_format_text() and
       bt_set_format_options() provide that capability.

       The format controls the following:

       •   which name parts are printed, and in what order (e.g. "first von
           last jr", or "von last jr first")

       •   the text that precedes and follows each part (e.g. if the first
           name follows the last name, you probably want a comma before the
           `first' part: "Smith, John" rather than "Smith John")

       •   the text that precedes and follows each token (e.g. if the first
           name is abbreviated, you may want a period after each token: "J. R.
           Smith" rather than "J R Smith")

       •   the method used to join the tokens of each part together

       •   the method used to join each part to the following part

       All of these except the list of parts to format are kept in arrays
       indexed by name part: for example, the structure has a field

          char * post_token[BT_MAX_NAMEPARTS]

       and "post_token[BTN_FIRST]" ("BTN_FIRST" is from the "bt_namepart"
       "enum") is the string to be added after each token in the first
       name---for example, "." if the first name is to be abbreviated in the
       conventional way.

       Yet another "enum", "bt_joinmethod", describes the available methods
       for joining tokens together.  Note that there are two sets of join
       methods in a name format: between tokens within a single part, and
       between the tokens of two different parts.  The first allows you, for
       example, to change "J R Smith" (first name abbreviated with no post-
       token text but tokens joined by a space) to "JR Smith" (the same, but
       first-name tokens jammed together).  The second is mainly used to
       ensure that "von" and "last" name-parts may be joined with a tie:
       "de~Roche" rather than "de Roche".

       The token join methods are:

       BTJ_MAYTIE
           Insert a "discretionary tie" between tokens.  That is, either a
           space or a "tie" is inserted, depending on context.  (A "tie,"
           otherwise known as unbreakable space, is currently hard-coded as
           "~"---from TeX.)

           The format is then applied to a particular name by
           bt_format_name(), which returns a new string.

       BTJ_SPACE
           Always insert a space between tokens.

       BTJ_FORCETIE
           Always insert a "tie" ("~") between tokens.

       BTJ_NOTHING
           Insert nothing between tokens---just jam them together.

       Tokens are joined together, and thus the choice of whether to insert a
       "discretionary tie" is made, at two places: within a part and between
       two parts.  Naturally, this only applies when "BTJ_MAYTIE" was supplied
       as the token-join method; "BTJ_SPACE" and "BTJ_FORCETIE" always insert
       either a space or tie, and "BTJ_NOTHING" always adds nothing between
       tokens.  Within a part, ties are added after a the first token if it is
       less than three characters long, and before the last token.  Between
       parts, a tie is added only if the preceding part consisted of single
       token that was less than three characters long.  In all other cases,
       spaces are inserted.  (This implementation slavishly follows BibTeX.)

FUNCTIONS
       bt_create_name_format()
              bt_name_format * bt_create_name_format (char * parts,
                                                      boolean abbrev_first)

           Creates a name format for a given set of parts, with variations for
           the most common forms of customization---the order of parts and
           whether to abbreviate the first name.

           The "parts" parameter specifies which parts to include in a
           formatted name, as well as the order in which to format them.
           "parts" must be a string of four or fewer characters, each of which
           denotes one of the four name parts: for instance, "vljf" means to
           format all four parts in "von last jr first" order.  No characters
           outside of the set "fvlj" are allowed, and no characters may be
           repeated.  "abbrev_first" controls whether the `first' part will be
           abbreviated (i.e., only the first letter from each token will be
           printed).

           In addition to simply setting the list of parts to format and the
           "abbreviate" flag for the first name, bt_create_name_format()
           initializes the entire format structure so as to minimize the need
           for further customizations:

           •   The "token join method"---what to insert between tokens of the
               same part---is set to "BTJ_MAYTIE" (discretionary tie) for all
               parts

           •   The "part join method"---what to insert after the final token
               of a particular part, assuming there are more parts to
               come---is set to "BTJ_SPACE" for the `first', `last', and `jr'
               parts.  If the `von' part is present and immediately precedes
               the `last' part (which will almost always be the case),
               "BTJ_MAYTIE" is used to join `von' to `last'; otherwise, `von'
               also gets "BTJ_SPACE" for the inter-part join method.

           •   The abbreviation flag is set to "FALSE" for the `von', `last',
               and `jr' parts; for `first', the abbreviation flag is set to
               whatever you pass in as "abbrev_first".

           •   Initially, all "surrounding text" (pre-part, post-part, pre-
               token, and post-token) for all parts is set to the empty
               string.  Then a few tweaks are done, depending on the
               "abbrev_first" flag and the order of tokens.  First, if
               "abbrev_first" is "TRUE", the post-token text for first name is
               set to "."---this changes "J R Smith" to "J. R. Smith", which
               is usually the desired form.  (If you don't want the periods,
               you'll have to set the post-token text yourself with
               bt_set_format_text().)

               Then, if `jr' is present and immediately after `last' (almost
               always the case), the pre-part text for `jr' is set to ", ",
               and the inter-part join method for `last' is set to
               "BTJ_NOTHING".  This changes "John Smith Jr" (where the space
               following "Smith" comes from formatting the last name with a
               "BTJ_SPACE" inter-part join method) to "John Smith, Jr" (where
               the ", " is now associated with "Jr"---that way, if there is no
               `jr' part, the ", " will not be printed.)

               Finally, if `first' is present and immediately follows either
               `jr' or `last' (which will usually be the case in "last-name
               first" formats), the same sort of trickery is applied: the pre-
               part text for `first' is set to ", ", and the part join method
               for the preceding part (either `jr' or `last') is set to
               "BTJ_NOTHING".

           While all these rules are rather complicated, they mean that you
           are usually freed from having to do any customization of the name
           format.  Certainly this is the case if you only need "fvlj" and
           "vljf" part orders, only want to abbreviate the first name, want
           periods after abbreviated tokens, non-breaking spaces in the
           "right" places, and commas in the conventional places.

           If you want something out of the ordinary---for instance,
           abbreviated tokens jammed together with no puncuation, or
           abbreviated last names---you'll need to customize the name format a
           bit with bt_set_format_text() and bt_set_format_options().

       bt_free_name_format()
              void bt_free_name_format (bt_name_format * format)

           Frees a name format created by bt_create_name_format().

       bt_set_format_text()
              void bt_set_format_text (bt_name_format * format,
                                       bt_namepart part,
                                       char * pre_part,
                                       char * post_part,
                                       char * pre_token,
                                       char * post_token)

           Allows you to customize some or all of the surrounding text for a
           single name part.  Supply "NULL" for any chunk of text that you
           don't want to change.

           For instance, say you want a name format that will abbreviate first
           names, but without any punctuation after the abbreviated tokens.
           You could create and customize the format as follows:

              format = bt_create_name_format ("fvlj", TRUE);
              bt_set_format_text (format,
                                  BTN_FIRST,       /* name-part to customize */
                                  NULL, NULL,      /* pre- and post- part text */
                                  NULL, "");       /* empty string for post-token */

           Without the bt_set_format_text() call, "format" would result in
           names formatted like "J. R. Smith".  After setting the post-token
           text for first names to "", this name would become "J R Smith".

       bt_set_format_options()
              void bt_set_format_options (bt_name_format * format,
                                          bt_namepart part,
                                          boolean abbrev,
                                          bt_joinmethod join_tokens,
                                          bt_joinmethod join_part)

           Allows further customization of a name format: you can set the
           abbreviation flag and the two token-join methods.  Alas, there is
           no mechanism for leaving a value unchanged; you must set everything
           with bt_set_format_options().

           For example, let's say that just dropping periods from abbreviated
           tokens in the first name isn't enough; you really want to save
           space by jamming the abbreviated tokens together: "JR Smith" rather
           than "J R Smith"  Assuming the two calls in the above example have
           been done, the following will finish the job:

              bt_set_format_options (format, BTN_FIRST,
                                     TRUE,         /* keep same value for abbrev flag */
                                     BTJ_NOTHING,  /* jam tokens together */
                                     BTJ_SPACE);   /* space after final token of part */

           Note that we unfortunately had to know (and supply) the current
           values for the abbreviation flag and post-part join method, even
           though we were only setting the intra-part join method.

       bt_format_name()
              char * bt_format_name (bt_name * name, bt_name_format * format)

           Once a name format has been created and customized to your heart's
           content, you can use it to format any number of names that have
           been split with "bt_split_name" (see bt_split_names).  Simply pass
           the name structure and name format structure, and a newly-allocated
           string containing the formatted name will be returned to you.  It
           is your responsibility to free() this string.
