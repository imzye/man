NAME
       DBD::SQLite2 - Self Contained RDBMS in a DBI Driver (sqlite 2.x)

SYNOPSIS
         use DBI;
         my $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:SQLite2:dbname=dbfile","","");

DESCRIPTION
       SQLite is a public domain RDBMS database engine that you can find at
       http://www.sqlite.org/.

       Rather than ask you to install SQLite first, because SQLite is public
       domain, DBD::SQLite2 includes the entire thing in the distribution. So
       in order to get a fast transaction capable RDBMS working for your perl
       project you simply have to install this module, and nothing else.

       For real work please use the updated DBD::SQLite driver with the up-to-
       date sqlite3 backend.  SQLite2 supports the following features:

       Implements a large subset of SQL92
           See http://www.sqlite.org/lang.html for details.

       A complete DB in a single disk file
           Everything for your database is stored in a single disk file,
           making it easier to move things around than with DBD::CSV.

       Atomic commit and rollback
           Yes, DBD::SQLite2 is small and light, but it supports full
           transactions

       Extensible
           User-defined aggregate or regular functions can be registered with
           the SQL parser.

       There's lots more to it, so please refer to the docs on the SQLite web
       page, listed above, for SQL details. Also refer to DBI for details on
       how to use DBI itself.

CONFORMANCE WITH DBI SPECIFICATION
       The API works like every DBI module does. Please see DBI for more
       details about core features.

       Currently many statement attributes are not implemented or are limited
       by the typeless nature of the SQLite2 database.

DRIVER PRIVATE ATTRIBUTES
   Database Handle Attributes
       sqlite_version
           Returns the version of the SQLite library which DBD::SQLite2 is
           using, i.e, "2.8.15".

       sqlite_encoding
           Returns either "UTF-8" or "iso8859" to indicate how the SQLite
           library was compiled.

       sqlite_handle_binary_nulls
           Set this attribute to 1 to transparently handle binary nulls in
           quoted and returned data.

           NOTE: This will cause all backslash characters ("\") to be doubled
           up in all columns regardless of whether or not they contain binary
           data or not. This may break your database if you use it from
           another application. This does not use the built in
           "sqlite_encode_binary" and "sqlite_decode_binary" functions, which
           may be considered a bug.

DRIVER PRIVATE METHODS
   $dbh->func('last_insert_rowid')
       This method returns the last inserted rowid. If you specify an INTEGER
       PRIMARY KEY as the first column in your table, that is the column that
       is returned.  Otherwise, it is the hidden ROWID column. See the sqlite
       docs for details.

   $dbh->func( $name, $argc, $func_ref, "create_function" )
       This method will register a new function which will be useable in SQL
       query. The method's parameters are:

       $name
           The name of the function. This is the name of the function as it
           will be used from SQL.

       $argc
           The number of arguments taken by the function. If this number is
           -1, the function can take any number of arguments.

       $func_ref
           This should be a reference to the function's implementation.

       For example, here is how to define a now() function which returns the
       current number of seconds since the epoch:

           $dbh->func( 'now', 0, sub { return time }, 'create_function' );

       After this, it could be use from SQL as:

           INSERT INTO mytable ( now() );

   $dbh->func( $name, $argc, $pkg, 'create_aggregate' )
       This method will register a new aggregate function which can then used
       from SQL. The method's parameters are:

       $name
           The name of the aggregate function, this is the name under which
           the function will be available from SQL.

       $argc
           This is an integer which tells the SQL parser how many arguments
           the function takes. If that number is -1, the function can take any
           number of arguments.

       $pkg
           This is the package which implements the aggregator interface.

       The aggregator interface consists of defining three methods:

       new()
           This method will be called once to create an object which should be
           used to aggregate the rows in a particular group. The step() and
           finalize() methods will be called upon the reference return by the
           method.

       step(@_)
           This method will be called once for each rows in the aggregate.

       finalize()
           This method will be called once all rows in the aggregate were
           processed and it should return the aggregate function's result.
           When there is no rows in the aggregate, finalize() will be called
           right after new().

       Here is a simple aggregate function which returns the variance (example
       adapted from pysqlite):

           package variance;

           sub new { bless [], shift; }

           sub step {
               my ( $self, $value ) = @_;

               push @$self, $value;
           }

           sub finalize {
               my $self = $_[0];

               my $n = @$self;

               # Variance is NULL unless there is more than one row
               return undef unless $n || $n == 1;

               my $mu = 0;
               foreach my $v ( @$self ) {
                   $mu += $v;
               }
               $mu /= $n;

               my $sigma = 0;
               foreach my $v ( @$self ) {
                   $sigma += ($x - $mu)**2;
               }
               $sigma = $sigma / ($n - 1);

               return $sigma;
           }

           $dbh->func( "variance", 1, 'variance', "create_aggregate" );

       The aggregate function can then be used as:

           SELECT group_name, variance(score) FROM results
           GROUP BY group_name;

NOTES
       To access the database from the command line, try using dbish which
       comes with the DBI module. Just type:

         dbish dbi:SQLite:foo.db

       On the command line to access the file foo.db.

       Alternatively you can install SQLite from the link above without
       conflicting with DBD::SQLite2 and use the supplied "sqlite" command
       line tool.

PERFORMANCE
       SQLite is fast, very fast. I recently processed my 72MB log file with
       it, inserting the data (400,000+ rows) by using transactions and only
       committing every 1000 rows (otherwise the insertion is quite slow), and
       then performing queries on the data.

       Queries like count(*) and avg(bytes) took fractions of a second to
       return, but what surprised me most of all was:

         SELECT url, count(*) as count FROM access_log
           GROUP BY url
           ORDER BY count desc
           LIMIT 20

       To discover the top 20 hit URLs on the site (http://axkit.org), and it
       returned within 2 seconds. I'm seriously considering switching my log
       analysis code to use this little speed demon!

       Oh yeah, and that was with no indexes on the table, on a 400MHz PIII.

       For best performance be sure to tune your hdparm settings if you are
       using linux. Also you might want to set:

         PRAGMA default_synchronous = OFF

       Which will prevent sqlite from doing fsync's when writing (which slows
       down non-transactional writes significantly) at the expense of some
       peace of mind. Also try playing with the cache_size pragma.

BUGS
       Likely to be many, please use http://rt.cpan.org/ for reporting bugs.
