NAME
       xconq - X-based configurable strategy game

SYNOPSIS
       xconq [ options ] ...

DESCRIPTION
       xconq is a configurable multi-player strategy game.

       By default, xconq brings up a series of dialogs that let you choose the
       game, game variants, and the players.

       In addition, xconq has extensive and elaborate facilities for building
       maps, scenarios, and sets of rules, allowing for a wide variety of
       games.

OPTIONS
       The following options are X-specific:

       -bg bgcolor
            sets the background color of the windows.

       -display display
            sets the display to be used by the default player.

       -fg fgcolor
            sets the foreground color of the windows.

       -geometry geometry
            sets the geometry of the first window.

       -name name
            sets the name of the application.

       -x   allows the game and the players to be set up interactively via
            menus.  The menus should be self-explanatory.

       The following options are generic, and may be used with any version of
       Xconq that allows command-line arguments:


       Each argument will be taken to be a specification of a player who will
       participate in the game.  The format of a player spec is

              [name[,ai][/config]@]host[+advantage]

       where host is the name of a host.  advantage is a multiplier specifying
       how much more a player gets to start with, so a player at +3 in the
       standard game gets 3 cities and 15 towns instead of the usual 1 and 5.

       -e[,ai][+adv] number
            sets the number of machine players (AIs) not attached to displays.
            If ai and/or adv are supplied, each of the machine players will
            get that AI type and advantage.

       -h number
            creates number players that may have displays and waits for them
            to join the game (via -join, see below).

       General options:

       -c number
            sets checkpointing to occur every number turns.

       -f name
            reads the file named name, interpreting as a game.

       -g name
            reads the game named name.

       -help, --help
            displays help information and exits.

       -host game
            sets up a network game named game.

       -join game
            connects to a network game named game.

       -L pathname
            sets the location to search for game files to pathname.

       -noai
            suppresses all AI creation when setting up the game.

       -r   suppresses the creation of the default player.

       --version
            displays version information and exits.

       -w   suppresses warnings.

       Variant options:

       -M width[xheight]
            generates a random map of the given size.  The size must be at
            least 5x5, although some periods will impose additional
            constraints on the lower bound.  In theory, there is no upper
            bound (but 200x200 would be huge).

       -seq makes all the players move one at a time.

       -sim allows all the players to move simultaneously.

       -tgame number
            limits the total length of the game to number minutes.

       -tside number
            limits the total time of play for each side to number minutes.
            Time is only counted while actually waiting for input.

       -tturn number
            limits the time of play for each side to number minutes per side
            per turn.  Time is only counted while actually waiting for input.

       -v   makes the entire world seen by all players at the outset.  This is
            useful if exploration is deemed to be time-consuming, or if the
            world is already known to everybody.  Some games have this enabled
            by default.

       -V   makes everything seen all the time.  Some games have this enabled
            by default.

       -vvariant-name[=variant-value]
            sets variants that are defined by the chosen game.  The options
            "-g game -vhelp" will list the available variants.

       Designing and debugging options:

       -design
            enables designer mode, if available.

       -D[-GM]
            enables debugging output, if available.

       -R number
            sets the random seed to number, if available.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       XCONQLIB
              If this is set to a directory pathname, Xconq will look here for
              library games.

       XCONQ_SCORES
              If this is set to a directory, Xconq will use it to store
              scorefiles instead of the compiled-in default.

       XCONQHOME
              This is the pathname to where Xconq will store saved games and
              preferences for a user.  If this is not set, Xconq will use
              $HOME/.xconq to store per-user files.

EXAMPLES
       xconq -g standard
               Standard game, one human on local display, one AI, 60x30 random
               world

       xconq -g crater-lake
               One human vs one machine, playing the "crater lake" game

       xconq -e 2 -M 40x20
               One human, two mplayers, 40x20 random world

       xconq -e 6 -g u-e1-1998 -V
               Seven players (6 mplayer, 1 human), all playing on a 360x140
               map of the earth with present-day cities, with everything
               always visible.  Major!

       xconq ,ai+4
               Standard game, one human and one mplayer, mplayer has advantage
               of 4.

DIAGNOSTICS
       If the world is too small for the desired number of players, the
       program will complain about not being able to place units in good
       locations.

BUGS
       Specifying multiple games on the command line is usually asking for
       trouble.

       Some annoying behaviors are actually features.

       Networked games can get out of sync too easily.
