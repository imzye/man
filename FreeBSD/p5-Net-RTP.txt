NAME
       Net::RTP - Send and receive RTP packets (RFC3550)

SYNOPSIS
         use Net::RTP;

         my $rtp = new Net::RTP( LocalPort=>5170, LocalAddr=>'233.122.227.171' );

         my $packet = $rtp->recv();
         print "Payload type: ".$packet->payload_type()."\n";

DESCRIPTION
       The "Net::RTP" module subclasses IO::Socket::Multicast6 to enable you
       to manipulate multicast groups. The multicast additions are optional,
       so you may also send and recieve unicast packets.

       $rtp = new Net::RTP( [LocalAdrr=>$addr, LocalPort=>$port,...] )
           The new() method is the constructor for the Net::RTP class.  It
           takes the same arguments as IO::Socket::INET, however the Proto
           argument defaults to "udp", which is more appropriate for RTP.

           The Net::RTP super-class used will depend on what is available on
           your system it will try and use one of the following (in order of
           preference) :

                   IO::Socket::Multicast6 (IPv4 and IPv6 unicast and multicast)
                   IO::Socket::Multicast (IPv4 unicast and multicast)
                   IO::Socket::INET6 (IPv4 and IPv6 unicast)
                   IO::Socket::INET (IPv4 unicast)

           If LocalAddr looks like a multicast address, then Net::RTP will
           automatically try and join that multicast group for you.

       my $packet = $rtp->recv( [$size] )
           Blocks and waits for an RTP packet to arrive on the UDP socket.
           The read $size defaults to 2048 which is usually big enough to read
           an entire RTP packet (as it is advisable that packets are less than
           the Ethernet MTU).

           Returns a "Net::RTP::Packet" object or undef if there is a problem.

       $rtp->send( $packet )
           Send a Net::RTP::Packet from out of the RTP socket.  The PeerPort
           and PeerAddr should be defined in order to send packets.  Returns
           the number of bytes sent, or the undefined value if there is an
           error.

       $rtp->superclass()
           Returns the name of the super-class that Net::RTP chose to use.
