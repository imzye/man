ACME.CONF(5)              FreeBSD File Formats Manual             ACME.CONF(5)

NAME
     acme.conf – lfacme global configuration file

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/local/etc/lfacme/acme.conf

DESCRIPTION
     The acme.conf file is used to configure the global behaviour of lfacme.
     Each option should be configured as a sh(1) variable assignment, i.e.
     “option=value”.

     Alternatively, options may be set as environment variables prior to
     running lfacme.  If all required options are set in the environment, then
     the acme.conf file is not required.

     The following configuration options are supported:

     LFACME_URL
             (Required.)  The URL of the ACME server.

     LFACME_DATADIR
             The path to the runtime data directory, where the ACME account
             key and any issued certificates will be stored.  The default path
             is /var/db/lfacme.

     LFACME_HOOKDIR
             The path to a directory containing hooks to invoke when issuing
             certificates (see domains.conf(5)).  The default path is
             /usr/local/etc/lfacme/hooks.

     LFACME_OPENSSL
             Path to the openssl(1) program.  If not specified, $PATH will be
             searched.

     LFACME_UACME
             Path to the uacme(1) program.  If not specified, $PATH will be
             searched.

     Additional configuration variables may be used by the ACME validation
     hooks; refer to the manual page for each hook for more details.
