BFS(1)                  FreeBSD General Commands Manual                 BFS(1)

NAME
       bfs - breadth-first search for your files

SYNOPSIS
       bfs [flags...] [paths...] [expression...]

       flags (-H/-L/-P etc.), paths, and expressions may be freely mixed in
       any order.

DESCRIPTION
       bfs is a breadth-first version of the UNIX find(1) command.

       bfs supports almost every feature from every major find(1)
       implementation, so your existing command lines should work as-is.  It
       also adds some features of its own, such as a more forgiving command
       line parser and some additional options.

       Each path specified on the command line is treated as a starting path
       to search through.  If no paths are specified, the current directory
       (.) is searched by default.

       Like find(1), bfs interprets its arguments as a short-circuiting
       Boolean expression.  For example,

              bfs \( -name '*.txt' -or -lname '*.txt' \) -and -print

       will print all the paths that are either .txt files or symbolic links
       to .txt files.  -and is implied between two consecutive expressions, so
       this is equivalent:

              bfs \( -name '*.txt' -or -lname '*.txt' \) -print

       Finally, -print is implied if no actions are specified, so this too is
       equivalent:

              bfs -name '*.txt' -or -lname '*.txt'

       Most options that take a numeric argument N will also accept -N or +N.
       -N means "less than N," and +N means "greater than N."

FLAGS
       -H     Follow symbolic links on the command line, but not while
              searching.

       -L     Follow all symbolic links.

       -P     Never follow symbolic links (the default).

       -E     Use extended regular expressions (same as -regextype
              posix-extended).

       -X     Filter out files with non-xargs(1)-safe names.

       -d     Search in post-order (same as -depth).

       -s     Visit directory entries in sorted order.  The sorting takes
              place within each directory separately, which makes it different
              from bfs ... | sort, but still provides a deterministic
              ordering.

       -x     Don't descend into other mount points (same as -xdev).

       -f PATH
              Treat PATH as a path to search (useful if it begins with a
              dash).

       -D FLAG
              Turn on a debugging flag (see -D help).

       -ON
              Enable optimization level N (default: 3).

              -O0    Disable all optimizations.

              -O1    Basic logical simplifications.

              -O2    All -O1 optimizations, plus dead code elimination and
                     data flow analysis.

              -O3    All -O2 optimizations, plus re-order expressions to
                     reduce expected cost.

              -O4/-Ofast
                     All optimizations, including aggressive optimizations
                     that may alter the observed behavior in corner cases.

       -S bfs|dfs|ids|eds
              Choose the search strategy.

              bfs    Breadth-first search (the default).

              dfs    Depth-first search.  Uses less memory than breadth-first
                     search, but is typically slower to return relevant
                     results.

              ids    Iterative deepening search.  Performs repeated depth-
                     first searches with increasing depth limits.  This gives
                     results in the same order as breadth-first search, but
                     with the reduced memory consumption of depth-first
                     search.  Tends to be very slow in practice, so use it
                     only if you absolutely need breadth-first ordering, but
                     -S bfs consumes too much memory.

              eds    Exponential deepening search.  A compromise between
                     breadth- and depth-first search, which searches
                     exponentially increasing depth ranges (e.g. 0-1, 1-2,
                     2-4, 4-8, etc.).  Provides many of the benefits of
                     breadth-first search with depth-first's reduced memory
                     consumption.  Typically far faster than -S ids.

       -jN    Search with N threads in parallel (default: number of CPUs, up
              to 8).

OPERATORS
       ( expression )
              Parentheses are used for grouping expressions together.  You'll
              probably have to write \( expression \) to avoid the parentheses
              being interpreted by the shell.

       ! expression
       -not expression
              The "not" operator: returns the negation of the truth value of
              the expression.  You may have to write \! expression to avoid !
              being interpreted by the shell.

       expression expression
       expression -a expression
       expression -and expression
              Short-circuiting "and" operator: if the left-hand expression is
              true, returns the right-hand expression; otherwise, returns
              false.

       expression -o expression
       expression -or expression
              Short-circuiting "or" operator: if the left-hand expression is
              false, returns the right-hand expression; otherwise, returns
              true.

       expression , expression
              The "comma" operator: evaluates the left-hand expression but
              discards the result, returning the right-hand expression.

SPECIAL FORMS
       -exclude expression
              Exclude all paths matching the expression from the search.  This
              is more powerful than -prune, because it applies even when the
              expression wouldn't otherwise be evaluated, due to -depth or
              -mindepth for example.  Exclusions are always applied before
              other expressions, so it may be least confusing to put them
              first on the command line.

       -help
       --help
              Print usage information, and exit immediately (without parsing
              the rest of the command line or processing any files).

       -version
       --version
              Print version information, and exit immediately.

OPTIONS
       -color
       -nocolor
              Turn colors on or off (default: -color if outputting to a
              terminal, -nocolor otherwise).

       -daystart
              Measure time relative to the start of today.

       -depth Search in post-order (descendents first).

       -follow
              Follow all symbolic links (same as -L).

       -files0-from FILE
              Treat the NUL ('\0')-separated paths in FILE as starting points
              for the search.  Pass -files0-from - to read the paths from
              standard input.

       -ignore_readdir_race
       -noignore_readdir_race
              Whether to report an error if bfs detects that the file tree is
              modified during the search (default: -noignore_readdir_race).

       -maxdepth N
       -mindepth N
              Ignore files deeper/shallower than N.

       -mount Exclude mount points entirely from the results.

       -noerror
              Ignore any errors that occur during traversal.

       -nohidden
              Exclude hidden files and directories.

       -noleaf
              Ignored; for compatibility with GNU find.

       -regextype TYPE
              Use TYPE-flavored regular expressions.  The possible types are

              posix-basic
                     POSIX basic regular expressions (the default).

              posix-extended
                     POSIX extended regular expressions.

              ed     Like ed(1) (same as posix-basic).

              emacs  Like emacs(1).

              grep   Like grep(1).

              sed    Like sed(1) (same as posix-basic).

              See regex(7) for a description of regular expression syntax.

       -status
              Display a status bar while searching.

       -unique
              Skip any files that have already been seen.  Particularly useful
              along with -L.

       -warn
       -nowarn
              Turn on or off warnings about the command line.

       -xdev  Don't descend into other mount points.  Unlike -mount, the mount
              point itself is still included.

              Multiple types can be given at once, separated by commas.  For
              example, -type d,f matches both directories and regular files.

       -used [-+]N
              Find files last accessed N days after they were changed.

       -xattr Find files with extended attributes (xattr(7)).

              Find files with the extended attribute NAME.

       -xtype [bcdlpfswD]
              Find files of the given type, following links when -type would
              not, and vice versa.

ACTIONS
       -delete
       -rm
              Delete any found files (implies -depth).

       -exec command ... {} ;
              Execute a command.

       -exec command ... {} +
              Execute a command with multiple files at once.

       -ok command ... {} ;
              Prompt the user whether to execute a command.

       -execdir command ... {} ;
       -execdir command ... {} +
       -okdir command ... {} ;
              Like -exec/-ok, but run the command in the same directory as the
              found file(s).

       -exit [STATUS]
              Exit immediately with the given status (0 if unspecified).

       -fls FILE
       -fprint FILE
       -fprint0 FILE
       -fprintf FILE FORMAT
              Like -ls/-print/-print0/-printf, but write to FILE instead of
              standard output.

       -limit N
              Quit once this action is evaluated N times.

       -ls    List files like ls -dils.

       -print Print the path to the found file.

       -print0
              Like -print, but use the null character ('\0') as a separator
              rather than newlines.  Useful in conjunction with xargs -0.

       -printf FORMAT
              Print according to a format string (see find(1)).  These
              additional format directives are supported:

              %w     The file's birth time, in the same format as %a/%c/%t.

              %Wk    Field k of the file's birth time, in the same format as
                     %Ak/%Ck/%Tk.

       -printx
              Like -print, but escape whitespace and quotation characters, to
              make the output safe for xargs(1).  Consider using -print0 and
              xargs -0 instead.

       -prune Don't descend into this directory.  This has no effect if -depth
              is enabled (either explicitly, or implicitly by -delete).  Use
              -exclude instead in that case.

       -quit  Quit immediately.

ENVIRONMENT
       Certain environment variables affect the behavior of bfs.

       LANG
       LC_*
              Specifies the locale(7) in use for various things.  bfs is not
              (yet) translated to any languages except English, but the locale
              will still affect the format of printed values.  Yes/no prompts
              (e.g. from -ok) will also be interpreted according to the
              current locale.

       LS_COLORS
       BFS_COLORS
              Controls the colors used when displaying file paths if -color is
              enabled.  bfs interprets LS_COLORS the same way GNU ls(1) does
              (see dir_colors(5)).  BFS_COLORS can be used to customize bfs
              without affecting other commands.

       NO_COLOR
              Causes bfs to default to -nocolor if it is set (see https://no-
              color.org/).

       PAGER  Specifies the pager used for -help output.  Defaults to less(1),
              if found on the current PATH, otherwise more(1).

       PATH   Used to resolve executables for -exec[dir] and -ok[dir].

       POSIXLY_CORRECT
              Makes bfs conform more strictly to the POSIX.1-2017
              specification for find(1).  Currently this has two effects:

              •      Disables warnings by default, because POSIX prohibits
                     writing to standard error (except for the -ok prompt),
                     unless the command also fails with a non-zero exit
                     status.

              •      Makes -ls and -fls use 512-byte blocks instead of
                     1024-byte blocks.  (POSIX does not specify these actions,
                     but BSD find(1) implementations use 512-byte blocks,
                     while GNU find(1) uses 1024-byte blocks by default.)

              It does not disable bfs's various extensions to the base POSIX
              functionality.  POSIXLY_CORRECT has the same effects on GNU
              find(1).

EXAMPLES
       bfs    With no arguments, bfs prints all files under the current
              directory in breadth-first order.

       bfs -name '*.txt'
              Prints all the .txt files under the current directory.  *.txt is
              quoted to ensure the glob is processed by bfs rather than the
              shell.

       bfs -name access_log -L /var
              Finds all files named access_log under /var, following symbolic
              links.  bfs allows flags and paths to appear anywhere on the
              command line.

       bfs ~ -not -user $USER
              Prints all files in your home directory not owned by you.

       bfs -xtype l
              Finds broken symbolic links.

       bfs -name config -exclude -name .git
