NAME
       Lingua::ZH::Summarize - Summarizing bodies of Chinese text

SYNOPSIS
           use Lingua::ZH::Summarize;

           print summarize( $text );                    # Easy, no? :-)
           print summarize( $text, maxlength => 500 );  # 500-byte summary
           print summarize( $text, wrap => 75 );        # Wrap output to 75 col.

DESCRIPTION
       This is a simple module which makes an unscientific effort at
       summarizing Chinese text. It recognizes simple patterns which look like
       statements, abridges them, and concatenates them into something vaguely
       resembling a summary. It needs more work on large bodies of text, but
       it seems to have a decent effect on small inputs at the moment.

       Lingua::ZH::Summarize exports one function, summarize(), which takes
       the text to summarize as its first argument, and any number of optional
       directives in "name => value" form. The options it'll take are:

       maxlength
           Specifies the maximum length, in bytes, of the generated summary.

       wrap
           Prettyprints the summary output by wrapping it to the number of
           columns which you specify.  This requires the Lingua::ZH::Wrap
           module.

       Needless to say, this is a very simple and not terribly universally
       effective scheme, but it's good enough for a first draft, and I'll bang
       on it more later. Like I said, it's not a scientific approach to the
       problem, but it's better than nothing.
