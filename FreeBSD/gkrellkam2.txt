NAME
       gkrellkam-list - format of the list description files used by GKrellKam

DESCRIPTION
       GKrellKam lists describe a series of image sources, used in order or at
       random by the GKrellKam plugin. Online lists (downloadable by GKrellKam
       with HTTP) use this same syntax.

       Blank lines and comments (beginning with '#') in GKrellKam lists are
       ignored. Every line of text that does not begin with a tab character is
       considered an image source.

       An image source can be one of several types:

       image  Sources of type image consist of a complete local filename to an
              image file.

       url    Type url is just that; a ftp:// or http:// URL pointing at an
              online image file.

       script Type script is a system command, executed in a shell by
              GKrellKam when it's time to get this image. The output of the
              command is assumed to be a complete filename of a local image
              file, optionally terminated with newlines/whitespace. The
              corresponding image is loaded.

       list   Type list causes a different GKrellKam list to be included in
              the current one.

       Each image source line should look like this:

              type: name

       The "type: " part of the line can be omitted for images and URLs, to
       make these list files backwards compatible with earlier versions of
       GKrellKam, but it is suggested that you specify them. It will enhance
       the readability of the list file.

       There are also properties that can be applied to types image, url, and
       script. Properties must follow the image source line that they modify,
       and must begin with a tab character. These include:

       tooltip
              This sets the message shown when the mouse is kept over the
              image panel in GKrellKam for a few seconds. If not set, the
              image's filename or URL is shown instead.

       seconds
              This changes the number of seconds that an image will remain
              displayed.  If not set, the "Default number of seconds" set for
              that panel in the GKrellM configuration window will be used.

       refresh
              If set, this sets the minimum length of time that must elapse
              before the image is re-loaded. If the image cycles up before
              that time, the old image will be used. For script types, this
              means that the script will not be re-run. For url types, the
              image will not be fetched using wget. When this property is not
              set, url images will be downloaded every time they are
              displayed, and scripts will be run every time.

EXAMPLE
       This is a simple example of a GKrellKam list. For a better example, see
       example.list from this distribution.

              # .krellkam.list
              # This list rotates through ~/pics/mypic[1-4].jpg along with a
              # webcam, and then displays the pictures in ~/lists/sub.list

              image: /home/paul/pics/mypic1.jpg
              /home/paul/pics/mypic2.jpg
              image: /home/paul/pics/mypic3.jpg
              http://www.usu.edu/webcam/fullsize.jpg
              [tab] tooltip: This is the building where I work

              image: /home/paul/pics/mypic4.jpg
              [tab] seconds: 4
              [tab] tooltip: Don't display this one very long
