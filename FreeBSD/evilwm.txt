DESCRIPTION
       evilwm is a minimalist window manager based on aewm, extended to
       feature many keyboard controls, and otherwise altered to be more
       friendly.

       In evilwm, the focus follows the mouse pointer, and focus is not lost
       if you stray onto the root window.  The current window border is shaded
       gold, with other windows left as a dark grey.

       You can use the mouse to manipulate windows either by click/dragging
       the 1 pixel border, or by holding down Alt and doing so anywhere in the
       client window. The controls are:

       Button 1
              Move window.

       Button 2
              Resize window.

       Button 3
              Lower window.

       Most keyboard controls are used by holding down Control and Alt, then
       pressing a key. Available functions are:

       Return Spawn new terminal.

       Escape Delete current window.  Hold Shift as well to force kill a
              client.

       Insert Lower current window.

       H, J, K, L
              Move window left, down, up or right (16 pixels).  Holding Shift
              resizes the window instead.

       Y, U, B, N
              Move window to top-left, top-right, bottom-left or bottom-right
              of screen.

       I      Show information about current window.

       Equals Maximise current window vertically (toggle).

       X      Maximise current window (toggle).

       D      Toggle visible state of docks (e.g., pagers and launch bars).

       If compiled with virtual desktop support, these functions are also
       available:

       F      Fix or unfix current window.

       1--8   Switch virtual desktop.

       Left   Previous virtual desktop.

       Right  Next virtual desktop.

       A      Switch to the most recently unmapped virtual desktop.

       In addition to the above, Alt+Tab can be used to cycle through windows
       on screen.

       To make evilwm exit, you have to kill the process.

OPTIONS
       -display display
              specifies the X display to run on.

       -term termprog
              specifies an alternative program to run when spawning a new
              terminal (defaults to xterm, or x-terminal-emulator in Debian).
              Separate arguments with whitespace, and escape needed whitespace
              with a backslash.  Remember that special characters will also
              need to be protected from the shell.

       -fn fontname
              specify a font to use when resizing or displaying window titles.

       -fg foreground-colour
              frame colour of currently active window.

       -fc fixed-colour
              frame colour of active fixed windows.

       -bg background-colour
              frame colour of inactive windows.

       -bw borderwidth
              width of window borders in pixels.

       -snap num
              enable snap-to-border support.  num gives the proximity in
              pixels to snap to.

       -mask1 modifiers, -mask2 modifiers, -altmask modifier
              override the default keyboard modifiers used to grab keys for
              window manager functionality.  mask1 is used for most keyboard
              controls (default: control+alt), and mask2 is used for mouse
              button controls and cycling windows (default: alt).  altmask is
              used to modify the behaviour of certain controls (default:
              shift).  Modifiers may be separated with + signs.  Valid
              modifiers are shift, lock, control, alt, mod1, mod2, mod3, mod4,
              mod5.

       -app name/class
              match an application by instance name and class (for help in
              finding these, use the xprop tool to extract the WM_CLASS
              property).  Subsequent -geometry, -dock, -vdesk and -fixed
              options will apply to this match.

       -g, -geometry geometry
              apply a geometry (using a standard X geometry string) to
              applications matching the last -app.

       -dock  specify that application should be considered to be a dock, even
              if it lacks the appropriate property.

       -v, -vdesk vdesk
              specify a default virtual desktop for applications matching the
              last -app.  Note that desktops are numbered from 0.

       -f, -fixed
              specify that application is to start with a fixed client window
              (-s is also accepted to be compatible with previous versions).

       -nosoliddrag
              draw a window outline while moving or resizing.

       -V     print version number.

       evilwm will also read options, one per line, from a file called
       .evilwmrc in the user's home directory.  Options listed in a
       configuration file should omit the leading dash.  Options specified on
       the command line override those found in the configuration file.

FILES
       $HOME/.evilwmrc
