NAME
       Net::SAP - Session Announcement Protocol (rfc2974)

SYNOPSIS
         use Net::SAP;

         my $sap = Net::SAP->new( 'ipv6-global' );

         my $packet = $sap->receive();

         $sap->close();

DESCRIPTION
       Net::SAP allows receiving and sending of SAP (RFC2974) multicast
       packets over IPv4 and IPv6.

   METHODS
       $sap = Net::SAP->new( $group )
           The new() method is the constructor for the "Net::SAP" class.  You
           must specify the SAP multicast group you want to join:

                   ipv4-local
                   ipv4-org
                   ipv4-global
                   ipv6-node
                   ipv6-link
                   ipv6-site
                   ipv6-org
                   ipv6-global

           Alternatively you may pass the address of the multicast group
           directly. When the "Net::SAP" object is created, it joins the
           multicast group, ready to start receiving or sending packets.

       $packet = $sap->receive()
           This method blocks until a valid SAP packet has been received.  The
           packet is parsed, decompressed and returned as a "Net::SAP::Packet"
           object.

       $sap->send( $data )
           This method sends out SAP packet on the multicast group that the
           "Net::SAP" object to bound to. The $data parameter can either be a
           "Net::SAP::Packet" object, a "Net::SDP" object or raw SDP data.

           Passing a "Net::SAP::Packet" object gives the greatest control over
           what is sent. Otherwise default values will be used.

           If no origin_address has been set, then it is set to the IP address
           of the first network interface.

           Packets greater than 1024 bytes will not be sent. This method
           returns 0 if packet was sent successfully.

       $group = $sap->group()
           Returns the address of the multicast group that the socket is bound
           to.

       $ttl = $sap->ttl( [$value] )
           Gets or sets the TTL of outgoing packets.

       $sap->close()
           Leave the SAP multicast group and close the socket.

TODO
       add automatic detection of IPv6 origin address
       add method of choosing the network interface to use for multicast
       Packet decryption and validation
