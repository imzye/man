BUS_DESCRIBE_INTR(9)   FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual  BUS_DESCRIBE_INTR(9)

NAME
     BUS_DESCRIBE_INTR, bus_describe_intr – associate a description with an
     active interrupt handler

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <sys/bus.h>

     int
     BUS_DESCRIBE_INTR(device_t dev, device_t child, struct resource *irq,
         void *cookie, const char *descr);

     int
     bus_describe_intr(device_t dev, struct resource *irq, void *cookie,
         const char *fmt, ...);

DESCRIPTION
     The BUS_DESCRIBE_INTR() method associates a description with an active
     interrupt handler.  The cookie parameter must be the value returned by a
     successful call to BUS_SETUP_INTR(9) for the interrupt irq.

     The bus_describe_intr() function is a simple wrapper around
     BUS_DESCRIBE_INTR().  As a convenience, bus_describe_intr() allows the
     caller to use printf(9) style formatting to build the description string
     using fmt.

     When an interrupt handler is established by BUS_SETUP_INTR(9), the
     handler is named after the device the handler is established for.  This
     name is then used in various places such as interrupt statistics
     displayed by systat(1) and vmstat(8).  For devices that use a single
     interrupt, the device name is sufficiently unique to identify the
     interrupt handler.  However, for devices that use multiple interrupts it
     can be useful to distinguish the interrupt handlers.  When a description
     is set for an active interrupt handler, a colon followed by the
     description is appended to the device name to form the interrupt handler
     name.

RETURN VALUES
     Zero is returned on success, otherwise an appropriate error is returned.

HISTORY
     The BUS_DESCRIBE_INTR() method and bus_describe_intr() functions first
     appeared in FreeBSD 8.1.

BUGS
     It is not currently possible to remove a description from an active
     interrupt handler.
