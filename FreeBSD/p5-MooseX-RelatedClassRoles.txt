MooseX::RelatedClassRoles(3)               User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       MooseX::RelatedClassRoles - Apply roles to a class related to yours

VERSION
       version 0.004

SYNOPSIS
           package My::Class;
           use Moose;

           has driver_class => (
             isa => 'MyApp::Driver',
           );

           with 'MooseX::RelatedClassRoles' => { name => 'driver' };

           # ...

           my $obj = My::Class->new(driver_class => "Some::Driver");
           $obj->apply_driver_class_roles("Other::Driver::Role");

DESCRIPTION
       Frequently, you have to use a class that provides some "foo_class"
       accessor or attribute as a method of dependency injection.  Use this
       role when you'd rather apply roles to make your custom "foo_class"
       instead of manually setting up a subclass.

PARAMETERS
   name
       A string naming the related class.  "driver" in the "SYNOPSIS".
       Required.

   class_accessor_name
       A string naming the related class accessor.  "driver_class" in the
       "SYNOPSIS".  Defaults to appending "_class" to the "name".

   apply_method_name
       A string naming the role applying method.  "apply_driver_class_names"
       in the "SYNOPSIS".  Defaults to adding "apply_" and "_names" to the
       "class_accessor_name".
