NAME
       W3C::LogValidator - The W3C Log Validator - Quality-focused Web Server
       log processing engine

       Checks quality/validity of most popular content on a Web server

DESCRIPTION
       "W3C::LogValidator" is the main module for the W3C Log Validator, a
       combination of Web Server log analysis and statistics tool and Web
       Content quality checker.

       The "W3C::LogValidator" can batch-process a number of documents through
       a number of quality focus checks, such as HTML or CSS validation, or
       checking for broken links. It can take a number of different inputs,
       ranging from a simple list of URIs to log files from various Web
       servers. And since it orders the result depending on the number of
       times a document appears in the file or logs, it is, in practice, a
       useful way to spot the most popular documents that need work.

       the perl script logprocess.pl, bundled in the W3C::LogValidator
       distribution, is a simple way to use the features of
       "W3C::LogValidator". Developers can also use "W3C::LogValidator" can be
       used as a perl module to build applications.

       The homepage for the Log Validator is at:
       http://www.w3.org/QA/Tools/LogValidator/

SYNOPSIS
       The simple way to use is to edit the sample configuration file
       (samples/logprocess.conf) and to run the bundled logprocess.pl script
       with this configuration file, a la:

           logprocess.pl -f /path/to/logprocess.conf

       The basic task of the "W3C::LogValidator" module is to parse a
       configuration file and process relevant logs, passed through a
       configuration file argument:

           use W3C::LogValidator;
           my $logprocessor = W3C::LogValidator->new("sample.conf");
           $logprocessor->process;

       Alternatively, it will use default a default config and try to process
       Web server logs in "well known locations":

           my $logprocessor = W3C::LogValidator->new;
           $logprocessor->process;

API
   Constructor
       $processor = W3C::LogValidator->new
         Constructs a new "W3C::LogValidator" processor.  You might pass a
         configuration file name, as well as a hash of attribute-value pairs
         as parameters to the constructor.

         e.g. for mail output:

           %conf = (
             "UseOutputModule" => "W3C::LogValidator::Output::Mail",
             "ServerAdmin" => 'webmaster@example.com',
             "verbose" => "3"
             );
           $processor = W3C::LogValidator->new("path/to/config.conf", \%conf);

         Or e.g. for HTML output:

           %conf = (
             "UseOutputModule" => "W3C::LogValidator::Output::HTML",
             "OutputTo" => 'path/to/file.html',
             "verbose" => "0"
             );
           $processor = W3C::LogValidator->new("path/to/config.conf", \%conf);

         If given the path to a configuration file, new() will call the
         W3C::LogValidator::Config module to get its configuration variables.
         Otherwise, a default set of values is used.

   Main processing method
       $processor->process =item $processor->find_remote_addr
           Given a log record and the type of the log (common log format, flat
           list of URIs, etc), extracts the remote host or ip

           Do-it-all method: Read configuration file (if any), parse log
           files, run them through processing modules, send result to output
           module.

   Modules methods
       $processor->config_module
           Creates a configuration hash for a specific module, adding module-
           specific configuration variables, overriding if necessary

       $processor->use_modules
           Run the data parsed off the log files through the various
           processing (validation) modules specified by UseValidationModule in
           the configuration.

   Log parsing and URI methods
       $processor->read_logfiles
           Loops through and parses all log files specified in the
           configuration

       $processor->read_logfile('path/to.file')
           Extracts URIs and number of hits from a given log file, and feeds
           it to the processor's URI/Hits table

       $processor->find_uri
           Given a log record and the type of the log (common log format, flat
           list of URIs, etc), extracts the URI

       $processor->remove_duplicates
           Given a URI, removes "directory index" suffixes such as index.html,
           etc so that http://foobar/ and http://foobar/index.html be counted
           as one resource

       $processor->add_uri
           Add a URI to the processor's URI/Hits table

       $processor->sorted_uris
           Returns the list of URIs in the processor's table, sorted by
           popularity (hits)

       $processor->no_cgi
           Tests whether a given URI contains a CGI query string

       $processor->hit
           Returns the number of hits for a given URI.  Basically a "public"
           method accessing $hits{$uri};

   Articles and Tutorials
       Several articles have been written within the W3C Quality Assurance
       Interest Group on the topic of improving the quality of Web sites,
       notably by using a step-by-step approach and relying upon the Log
       Validator to help find the areas to fix in priority.
