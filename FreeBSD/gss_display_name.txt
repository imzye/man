GSS_DISPLAY_NAME(3)                     FreeBSD Library Functions Manual (prm)

NAME
     gss_display_name – Convert internal-form name to text

SYNOPSIS
     #include <gssapi/gssapi.h>

     OM_uint32
     gss_display_name(OM_uint32 *minor_status, const gss_name_t input_name,
         gss_buffer_t output_name_buffer, gss_OID *output_name_type);

DESCRIPTION
     Allows an application to obtain a textual representation of an opaque
     internal-form name for display purposes.  The syntax of a printable name
     is defined by the GSS-API implementation.

     If input_name denotes an anonymous principal, the implementation should
     return the gss_OID value GSS_C_NT_ANONYMOUS as the output_name_type, and
     a textual name that is syntactically distinct from all valid supported
     printable names in output_name_buffer.

     If input_name was created by a call to gss_import_name(), specifying
     GSS_C_NO_OID as the name-type, implementations that employ lazy
     conversion between name types may return GSS_C_NO_OID via the
     output_name_type parameter.

PARAMETERS
     minor_status            Mechanism specific status code.

     input_name              Name to be displayed.

     output_name_buffer      Buffer to receive textual name string.  The
                             application must free storage associated with
                             this name after use with a call to
                             gss_release_buffer().

     output_name_type        The type of the returned name.  The returned
                             gss_OID will be a pointer into static storage,
                             and should be treated as read-only by the caller
                             (in particular, the application should not
                             attempt to free it).  Specify NULL if not
                             required.

RETURN VALUES
     GSS_S_COMPLETE      Successful completion

     GSS_S_BAD_NAME      input_name was ill-formed
