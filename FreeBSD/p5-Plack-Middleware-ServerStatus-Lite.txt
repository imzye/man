DESCRIPTION
       This is a simple command-line script that examines the local server
       status files to report on the status of a locally-running server,
       without incurring any network overhead nor using a worker.

OPTIONS
       scoreboard
           Required - same as the "scoreboard" option in the middleware.

       counter_file
           Optional - same as the "counter_file" option in the middleware.

       json
           Optional - when provided, returns the data in JSON format.
           Defaults to false.

       skip_ps_command
           Optional - when provided, skip executes `ps command`.  Please read
           perldoc Plack::Middleware::ServerStatus::Lite for details

CAVEATS
       This script mirrors the middleware's behaviour when the
       "skip_ps_command" option is set, because currently we do not know the
       server's  parent pid (the process where the middleware was originally
       loaded, before worker processes are forked off).  Therefore, data will
       be incomplete if not every worker has yet serviced a request before
       this script is run.
