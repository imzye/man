HOTKEYS(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             HOTKEYS(1)

NAME
       hotkeys - A hotkeys daemon for your Internet/multimedia keyboard in X

SYNOPSIS
       hotkeys [options...]

DESCRIPTION
       This program sits at the back and listens for the "special" hotkeys
       that you won't normally use on your Internet/Multimedia keyboards.  The
       buttons perform their intended behaviors, such as volume up and down,
       mute the speaker, launch applications, etc.  The functions are
       completely programmable.

       It has On-screen display (OSD) to show the volume, program that's being
       started, etc. Most importantly it looks cool.

       It features an XML-based keycode configuration file format, which makes
       it possible to define the hotkeys to launch any programs you want.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
               Prints a usage message.

       -t, --type=TYPE
               Specify the keyboard type.

       -l, --kbd-list
               Show all supported keyboards, and the code needed for the -t
               option.

       -o, --osd=STATE
               Turn off or on the on-screen display, default is on if OSD
               support is compiled with the program. Valid values for STATE
               are off/0/no/on/1/yes.

       -L, --loglevel=LEVEL
               Set the log level in syslog. LEVEL is a value from 0 to 7. 7
               will log all messages.

       -d, --cdrom-dev=DEVICE
               Specify the device of your CDROM drive, default to /dev/cdrom.
               If you give 'none', CDROM related functions will all be
               disabled.  You probably need to define it if you are using
               devfs.

       -b, --no-background
               Tells hotkeys NOT to fork itself and run in the background.
               The short option -b is not backward compatible to version 0.5.6
               or before, -b in these versions means run in the background.

       -F, --fix-vmware=TIME
               This option is mainly for users who run both hotkeys and VMware
               at the same time. Since VMware will delete some of the
               information from the memory of the X keyboard configuration due
               to reasons that I don't understand, a thread will be created to
               restore the necessary information regularly. The default time
               interval is 10 seconds. You can specify a time interval as you
               like, the value is in seconds. I don't think this option will
               have any side-effect to the operation of VMware, but if you
               find that this is not true, please file a bug report. (This
               option is just a hack, I will implement a nicer method to
               replace it.)

       -Z, --no-splash-screen
               Do not display the splash screen.

            And more...

       As I have only the Acer wireless keyboard, you can help me to support
       other keyboards by sending me the list of keycodes of the hotkeys on
       your keyboard. You can do this by using xev.  Contact me for the
       details.

KEYBOARD DEFINITION FILES
       Keycodes and the behavior of the hotkeys are stored in a Keyboard
       definition files. Each supported keyboard has such a file placed in
       either /usr/local/share/hotkeys or /usr/share/hotkeys, depending on the
       installation configuration. For instance, the data of the Acer Wireless
       keyboard is stored in the file acerwl.def.  Note that the part of the
       filename without the extension is the name you give to the -t option.

       Keyboard definition files are in XML format, which should be self-
       explanatory.

       You can create your own definition file and placed it in
       $HOME/.hotkeys. Just take the file def/sample.xml or an existing
       definition file as an example. User definition files override any
       system defaults.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       The configuration file is named hotkeys.conf. By default it is
       installed in /usr/local/etc (or /etc on Debian). You can also put one
       into $HOME/.hotkeys/, which will override the settings in the global
       file if one exists.  In other words, the order of parsing is the global
       file first and then the private one.

       The syntax of the file uses the simple key=value pairs. Blank lines and
       lines starting with # are ignored. The followings are the valid keys
       and their default values (they are subjected to be changed without
       prior notice =):

         Key             Default

NOTES
       Do not disable the XKEYBOARD extension. For XFree86 3.x, make sure
       XkbDisable is not set.

TODO
       Please consult the TODO file.

BUGS
       Please inform me if some of your normal keys lose functionalities after
       running hotkeys.

       APM support is highly experimental. I only tested on my desktop and
       sometimes it can't go out from Suspend mode, no response from the
       keyboard, mouse, nor the suspend button on the case. Not tested on
       notebook (I don't have one). Note that you need root priviledge to use
       the APM functions.

       There are probably bugs in the configure.in script.

       The error "X Error of failed request:  BadValue (integer parameter out
       of range for operation)" should have been fixed finally in version
       0.5.2.  Please report if it spits out this error on your system.
