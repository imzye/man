VGD(1)                       Viewglob Manual (vgd)                      VGD(1)

NAME
       vgd - Viewglob communication daemon.

SYNOPSIS
       vgd [options]


DESCRIPTION
       vgd acts as a mediator between any number of vgseer(1) processes and a
       single Viewglob display process (which it controls).  It keeps track of
       the active terminal and passes information from the corresponding
       vgseer (if there is one) to the display.

       While vgseer can be used on a remote machine using ssh or telnet, it
       only makes sense for vgd to be running on the same X server as the user
       (meaning, in most cases, locally).

       After successful startup, vgd uses the syslog interface for error
       reporting if running as a daemon.

       This program is slightly misnamed; traditionally, a single daemon
       process provides a service on a machine for all users.  In Viewglob's
       case, there should be separate vgd processes for each physical user
       running Viewglob.  The viewglob startup script handles this
       automatically, and is recommended for simple usage.


OPTIONS
       This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
       options starting with two dashes.  A summary is included below.

       -p, --port=<number>
              Listen on the given port.  The default is 16108 (1-GLOB).

       -P, --persistent=<on/off>
              Keep vgd around even after all vgseers have disconnected.  It
              will sit and listen for new connections instead of exiting.
              Persistence is off by default.

       -D, --daemon=<on/off>
              Run vgd as a daemon (it relinquishes its terminal).  vgd runs as
              a daemon by default.

       -d, --display=<vgclassic|vgmini|[path]>
              Display program.  The Viewglob package comes with vgclassic and
              vgmini (the new display).  Though there aren't any other
              displays in existence at this point, one could be used by
              passing its path.  The default is vgmini.

       -s, --sort-style=<windows|ls>
              In the display, sort files with directories first (Windows) or
              purely by name (ls).  ls mode is the default.

       -r, --dir-order=<descending|ascending|ascending-pwd-first>
              In the display, list directories in descending order (the
              default), ascending (last referenced directory has the top
              listing), or ascending with the current directory always first.

       -i, --file-icons=<on/off>
              Show or hide the file type icons in the display.

       -j, --jump-resize=<on/off>
              Enable or disable the automatic moving+resizing feature of
              vgmini.

       -z, --font-size-modifier=<+/-##>
              Increase or decrease the base font size in the display by the
              given number.  E.g. “-z +2” increases the window manager's
              default by 2, while “-z -2” decreases the default by 2.

       --black=<colour>
       --red=<colour>
       --green=<colour>
       --yellow=<colour>
       --blue=<colour>
       --magenta=<colour>
       --cyan=<colour>
       --white=<colour>
              Define the colours used for interpreting LS_COLORS as you would
              in an .Xdefaults file.  This means <colour> can be a name such
              as “DarkSlateGray” or a hex specification like #RRGGBB (quoted
              on the command line).  There are also other forms: see
              XParseColor(3) for more information.  The defaults are easy to
              read on a light coloured background, but probably not suitable
              for a dark background.  For that case, these should be a good
              starting point (add to vgd.conf):
                     black     #000000
                     red       #c11125
                     green     #50881e
                     yellow    #c4b400
                     blue      #1662a2
                     magenta   #ef709a
                     cyan      #2ca3a4
                     white     #ffffff

       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

       -V, --version
              Show the version of the program.


NOTES
       vgd keeps track of the active terminal by querying the X server.  This
       doesn't work great for tabbed terminals such as gnome-terminal and
       konsole, because they share an X window.  With these, you will need to
       wake up vgd when you shuffle around.  If you switch to a shell and the
       display doesn't automatically update, send it the refocus command C-g
       <TAB>.

       By default vgmini is in jump/resize mode, which means it'll move to be
       near the active terminal and change its dimensions to try to match.
       Some window managers just don't deal with this well and the resizing
       can get wacky.  If you're seeing this behaviour, you can disable
       jump/resize mode (or switch to a different window manager).


FILES
       ~/.viewglob/vgd.conf

              If present, this file specifies a default configuration for vgd.
              The file syntax is:

              <long_option_name> [ <whitespace> <value> ]

              The '#' character can be used for comments.

              So, to always listen on port 5555, run in persistent mode, and
              use a slightly smaller font than your window manager suggests,
              the file should contain:
              port                  5555
              persistent            on
              font-size-modifier    -1

              Configuration file options can be overridden on the command
              line.

       ~/.viewglob/.<port>

              Each instance of vgd listens on both an Internet-domain socket
              on the specified port, and a Unix-domain socket named for that
              port.  Connection attempts on either socket are treated
              equivalently.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       LS_COLORS
              Used by the display as described in dir_colors(5).

       If you encounter an issue where certain filenames do not show in the
       display and you are using an encoding other than UTF-8, you may want to
       read about the GLib environment variables:

              http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/glib/glib-running.html

       For example, for iso8859-1, run:

              G_FILENAME_ENCODING=ISO-8859-1 vgd


DIAGNOSTICS
       Exit status is 0 if vgd daemonizes or exits successfully.  If vgd fails
       to obtain a connection to the X display, exit status is 3.  If a socket
       setup error occurs, exit status is 2.  For other errors, exit status is
       1.
