NSS_RESINIT(8)          FreeBSD System Manager's Manual         NSS_RESINIT(8)



NAME
     nss_resinit – resolver re-initialization NSS module

SYNOPSIS
     hosts: resinit

DESCRIPTION
     The nss_resinit is a module for the nsswitch subsystem which makes
     resolver(3) reread resolv.conf(5) when it is updated.  In the traditional
     implementation of resolver(3) it is initialized by the application once
     and never reread resolv.conf(5) after that even if the file is updated.
     This module is useful especially when name servers in resolv.conf(5) are
     changed frequently as seen in mobile environment.

     To activate nss_resinit, resinit keyword is required before dns keyword
     in hosts entry of /etc/nsswitch.conf.  For example:

           hosts: resinit files dns

     Once resolv.conf(5) was reread, nss_resinit prevents from rereading
     resolv.conf(5) during certain period to intend to reduce overhead for
     checking a modified time of resolv.conf(5).  This interval can be changed
     by setting kenv(2) variable nss_resinit_interval.  The default interval
     is 10 seconds.

FILES
     /etc/nsswitch.conf
