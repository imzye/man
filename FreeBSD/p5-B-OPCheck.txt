NAME
       B::OPCheck - PL_check hacks using Perl callbacks

VERSION
       version 0.32

SYNOPSIS
           use B::Generate; # to change things

           use B::OPCheck entersub => check => sub {
               my $op = shift; # op has been checked by normal PL_check
               sodomize($op);
           };

           foo(); # this entersub will have the callback triggered

DESCRIPTION
       PL_check is an array indexed by opcode number (op_type) that contains
       function pointers invoked as the last stage of optree compilation, per
       op.

       This hook is called in bottom up order, as the code is parsed and the
       optree is prepared.

       This is how modules like autobox do their magic

       This module provides an api for registering PL_check hooks lexically,
       allowing you to alter the behavior of certain ops using B::Generate
       from perl space.

CHECK TYPES
       check
           Called after normal PL_checking. The return value is ignored.

       after
           Not yet implemented.

           Allows you to return a processed B::OP. The op has been processed
           by PL_check already.

       before
           Not yet implemented.

           Allows you to return a processed B::OP to be passed to normal
           PL_check.

       replace
           Not yet implemented.

           Allows you to return a processed B::OP yourself, skipping normal
           PL_check handling completely.
