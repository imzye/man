NAME
       Config::Perl::V - Structured data retrieval of perl -V output

SYNOPSIS
        use Config::Perl::V;

        my $local_config = Config::Perl::V::myconfig ();
        print $local_config->{config}{osname};

DESCRIPTION
   $conf = myconfig ()
       This function will collect the data described in "The hash structure"
       below, and return that as a hash reference. It optionally accepts an
       option to include more entries from %ENV. See "environment" below.

       Note that this will not work on uninstalled perls when called with
       "-I/path/to/uninstalled/perl/lib", but it works when that path is in
       $PERL5LIB or in $PERL5OPT, as paths passed using "-I" are not known
       when the "-V" information is collected.

   $conf = plv2hash ($text [, ...])
       Convert a sole 'perl -V' text block, or list of lines, to a complete
       myconfig hash.  All unknown entries are defaulted.

   $info = summary ([$conf])
       Return an arbitrary selection of the information. If no $conf is given,
       "myconfig ()" is used instead.

   $md5 = signature ([$conf])
       Return the MD5 of the info returned by "summary ()" without the
       "config_args" entry.

       If "Digest::MD5" is not available, it return a string with only 0's.

   The hash structure
       The returned hash consists of 4 parts:

       build
           This information is extracted from the second block that is emitted
           by "perl -V", and usually looks something like

           This information is not available anywhere else, including %Config,
           but it is the information that is only known to the perl binary.

           The extracted information is stored in 5 entries in the "build"
           hash:

           osname
               This is most likely the same as $Config{osname}, and was the
               name known when perl was built. It might be different if perl
               was cross-compiled.

               The default for this field, if it cannot be extracted, is to
               copy $Config{osname}. The two may be differing in casing
               (OpenBSD vs openbsd).

           stamp
               This is the time string for which the perl binary was compiled.
               The default value is 0.

           options
               This is a hash with all the known defines as keys. The value is
               either 0, which means unknown or unset, or 1, which means
               defined.

           derived
               As some variables are reported by a different name in the
               output of "perl -V" than their actual name in %Config, I
               decided to leave the "config" entry as close to reality as
               possible, and put in the entries that might have been guessed
               by the printed output in a separate block.

           patches
               This is a list of optionally locally applied patches. Default
               is an empty list.

       environment
           By default this hash is only filled with the environment variables
           out of %ENV that start with "PERL", but you can pass the "env"
           option to myconfig to get more

            my $conf = Config::Perl::V::myconfig ({ env => qr/^ORACLE/ });
            my $conf = Config::Perl::V::myconfig ([ env => qr/^ORACLE/ ]);

       config
           This hash is filled with the variables that "perl -V" fills its
           report with, and it has the same variables that "Config::myconfig"
           returns from %Config.

       inc This is the list of default @INC.

REASONING
       This module was written to be able to return the configuration for the
       currently used perl as deeply as needed for the CPANTESTERS framework.
       Up until now they used the output of myconfig as a single text blob,
       and so it was missing the vital binary characteristics of the running
       perl and the optional applied patches.
