App::Prove::Plugin::ShareDirDist(3)        User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       App::Prove::Plugin::ShareDirDist - A prove plugin that works with
       File::ShareDir::Dist

VERSION
       version 0.07

SYNOPSIS
        % prove -PShareDirDist -lv t

DESCRIPTION
       This plugin sets the override for File::ShareDir::Dist based on the
       current directory name, if there is a "share" directory.  It assumes
       that the directory name is the same as the dist name.  This may not be
       the case, but it happens to be the convention that I use.
