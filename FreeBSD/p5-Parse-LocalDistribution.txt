Parse::LocalDistribution(3)                User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Parse::LocalDistribution - parses local .pm files as PAUSE does

SYNOPSIS
           use Parse::LocalDistribution;

           my $parser = Parse::LocalDistribution->new({ALLOW_DEV_VERSION => 1});
           my $provides = $parser->parse('.');

DESCRIPTION
       This is a sister module of Parse::PMFile. This module parses local .pm
       files (and a META file if any) in a specific (current if not specified)
       directory, and returns a hash reference that represents "provides"
       information (with some extra meta data). This is almost the same as
       Module::Metadata does (which has been in Perl core since Perl 5.13.9).
       The main difference is the most of the code of this module is directly
       taken from the PAUSE code as of June 2013. If you need better
       compatibility to PAUSE, try this. If you need better performance,
       safety, or portability in general, Module::Metadata may be a better and
       handier option (Parse::PMFile (and thus Parse::LocalDistribution)
       actually evaluates code in the $VERSION line (in a Safe compartment),
       which may be problematic in some cases).

       This module doesn't provide a feature to extract a distribution. If you
       are too lazy to implement it, CPAN::ParseDistribution may be another
       good option.

METHODS
   new
       creates an object. You can pass an optional path and/or an optional
       hashref to configure. Options are:

       ALLOW_DEV_VERSION
           Parse::LocalDistribution (actually Parse::PMFile) usually ignores a
           version with an underscore as PAUSE does (because it's for a
           developer release, and should not be indexed). Set this option to
           true if you happen to need to keep such a version for better
           analysis.

       VERBOSE
           Set this to true if you need to know some details.

       FORK
           If you really need to let Parse::PMFile fork while parsing a
           version (as PAUSE does), set this to true.

       USERID, PERMISSIONS
           Parse::LocalDistribution checks permissions of a package if both
           USERID and PERMISSIONS (which should be an instance of
           PAUSE::Permissions) are provided. Unauthorized packages are
           removed.

       META_CONTENT
           If you already have parsed a META file, set this to avoid parsing
           the same META file again.

   parse
       may take a path to a local distribution, and return a hash reference
       that holds information for package(s) found in the directory.

SEE ALSO
       Most part of this module is derived from PAUSE.

       The following distributions do similar parsing, though the results may
       differ sometimes.
