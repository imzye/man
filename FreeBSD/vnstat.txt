DESCRIPTION
       vnStat is a console-based network traffic monitor. It keeps a log of 5
       minute interval, hourly, daily, monthly and yearly network traffic for
       the selected interface(s).  However, it isn't a packet sniffer. The
       traffic information is read from the proc(5) or sys filesystems
       depending on availability resulting in light use of system resources
       regardless of network traffic rate. That way vnStat can be used even
       without root permissions on most systems.

       Functionality is divided into two commands. The purpose of the vnstat
       command is to provide an interface for querying the traffic information
       stored in the database whereas the daemon vnstatd(8) is responsible for
       data retrieval, caching and storage. Although the daemon process is
       constantly running as a service, it is actually spending most of its
       time sleeping between data updates.


OPTIONS
       --95th Show 95th percentile output for the ongoing month. This output
              uses the 5 minute resolution data of the ongoing month to
              calculate the 95th percentile traffic rate for received,
              transmitted and total. In addition, the minimum, average and
              maximum traffic rates for received, transmitted and total are
              also shown. This output requires the 5MinuteHours configuration
              option to have a value of at least 744 for storing all the
              necessary data, otherwise 100% coverage isn't possible.


       --add  Create database entry for interface specified with -i or --iface
              option. The daemon can be running during this operation and will
              automatically start monitoring the interface without a restart
              within SaveInterval minutes if configuration option
              RescanDatabaseOnSave is enabled. Otherwise the daemon needs to
              be restarted in order for the added interface to be monitored.


       --alert output exit type condition limit unit
              Depending on values of given parameters, show alert, use
              different exit status or a combination of both when configured
              situation is met.


              output parameter takes a number from 0 to 3 and controls when,
              if at all, the command will result in output. '0' never produces
              output, '1' always produces output, '2' shows output only when
              usage estimate exceeds limit and '3' shows output only when
              limit is exceeded.


              exit parameter takes a number from 0 to 5 and controls the exit
              status of the command. '0' always uses exit status 0, '1' always
              uses exit status 1, '2' uses exit status 1 if usage estimate
              exceeds limit but otherwise exit status 0 and '3' uses exit
              status 1 if limit is exceeded but otherwise exit status 0. '4'
              and '5' are equivalents of '2' and '3' with the difference that
              exit status 2 is used instead of exit status 1 when the
              condition is met. This can help differentiate alerts from errors
              as errors will always use exit status 1.


              type parameter defines to which time range type usage the limit
              is compared against. Available options: 'h', 'hour', 'hourly',
              'd', 'day', 'daily', 'm', 'month', 'monthly', 'y', 'year',
              'yearly', 'p', '95', '95%'.


              condition parameter defines if limit is compared to received
              (rx), transmitted (tx), total or estimated usage of these three.
              Available options: 'rx', 'tx', 'total', 'rx_estimate',
              'tx_estimate', 'total_estimate'.  Estimate options aren't
              available for 95th percentile type.


              limit is a greater than zero integer without decimals which
              defines the traffic usage limit using the unit defined with the
              unit parameter.  unit accepts the following options: 'B', 'KiB',
              'MiB', 'GiB', 'TiB', 'PiB', 'EiB', 'KB', 'MB', 'GB', 'TB', 'PB',
              'EB'.  For 95th percentile type the following options are
              available: 'B/s', 'KiB/s', 'MiB/s', 'GiB/s', 'TiB/s', 'PiB/s',
              'EiB/s', 'kB/s', 'MB/s', 'GB/s', 'TB/s', 'PB/s', 'EB/s',
              'bit/s', 'Kibit/s', 'Mibit/s', 'Gibit/s', 'Tibit/s', 'Pibit/s',
              'Eibit/s', 'kbit/s', 'Mbit/s', 'Gbit/s', 'Tbit/s', 'Pbit/s',
              'Ebit/s'.  Usage must exceed limit in order for the alarm to
              activate. Exactly the same usage as limit does not raise the
              alarm.


              Estimate calculation isn't limited to the estimate options in
              condition parameter but can also be achieved by using the
              estimate option in output or exit parameters. Missing or invalid
              parameters or parameter combination will result in --alert
              specific help output being shown.


       -b, --begin date
              Begin the list output with a specific date / time defined by
              date instead of the begin being selected based on the number of
              entries to be shown.  If date isn't available in the database
              then the closest later date will be used.  date supports the
              following formats: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM, YYYY-MM-DD and "today".
              This option can only be used with --json , --xml and list
              outputs.


       --config file
              Use file as configuration file instead of using automatic
              configuration file search functionality. If --config is used
              multiple times, the configuration settings from files later on
              the command line will override configuration settings loaded
              from earlier files if the settings defined in the files overlap.


       -d, --days [limit]
              Show traffic statistics on a daily basis for the last days. The
              length of the list will be limited to 30 entries unless
              configured otherwise or unless the optional limit parameter is
              used. All entries stored in the database will be shown if limit
              is set to 0.


       --db file
              Use file as database file instead of searching for a database
              from the directory specified in the configuration file or the
              hardcoded default if no configuration file is available.  This
              option overrides --dbdir.


       --dbdir directory
              Use directory as database directory instead of using the
              directory specified in the configuration file or the hardcoded
              default if no configuration file is available. This option is
              ignored if --db is also defined.


       --dbiflist [mode]
              List interfaces currently in the database. If mode is not
              defined or is set to 0 then the output will use a one line
              verbose format. If mode is set to 1 then the output will contain
              one interface per line and if mode is set to 2 then only the
              interface count will be shown as a single number. See also
              --iflist.


       -D, --debug
              Show additional debug output.


       -e, --end date
              End the list output with a specific date / time defined by date
              instead of the latest date / time in the database. If date isn't
              available in the database then the closest earlier date will be
              used.  date supports the following formats: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM and
              YYYY-MM-DD.  This option can only be used with --json , --xml
              and list outputs. In list outputs the estimate line is replaced
              with a sum line with values representing the sums of each
              column. The sum line is shown only if the output consists of
              more than one data line. This is applicable even if the defined
              date is the same as the current date. The top list also requires
              --begin to be used at the same time with this option.


       -5, --fiveminutes [limit]
              Show traffic statistics with a 5 minute resolution for the last
              hours.  The length of the list will be limited to 24 entries
              unless configured otherwise or unless the optional limit
              parameter is used. All entries stored in the database will be
              shown if limit is set to 0.


       -h, --hours [limit]
              Show traffic statistics on a hourly basis. The length of the
              list will be limited to 24 entries unless configured otherwise
              or unless the optional limit parameter is used. All entries
              store in the database will be shown if the limit is set to 0.


       -hg, --hoursgraph
              Show traffic statistics on a hourly basis for the last 24 hours
              using a bar graph followed by a table representing the numerical
              data.


       -i, --iface interface
              Select one specific interface and apply actions to only it. For
              database queries, it is possible to merge the information of two
              or more interfaces using the interface1+interface2+...  syntax.
              All provided interfaces must be unique and must exist in the
              database when the merge syntax is used. Optionally, depending on
              the InterfaceMatchMethod configuration setting, interface can be
              replaced with alias previously set using --setalias.  Merge
              syntax isn't supported when alias is used. The -i, --iface
              option is optional and interface can be used as parameter on the
              command line for selecting the used interface even without the
              option being explicitly used.


       --iflist [mode]
              List currently available interfaces. If mode is not defined or
              is set to 0 then the output will use a one line verbose format.
              If mode is set to 1 then the output will contain one interface
              per line and if mode is set to 2 then only the interface count
              will be shown as a single number. See also --dbiflist.


       --json [mode] [limit]
              Show database content for selected interface or all interfaces
              in json format. All traffic values in the output are in bytes
              unless otherwise indicated by the name of the key. An optional
              mode parameter can be used for limiting the output to only
              selected information.  Everything except the 95th percentile
              output is shown by default. Setting mode to 's' will output a
              summary containing the last 2 entries of 5 minute, hourly,
              daily, monthly and yearly resolution data, 'f' will output only
              5 minute resolution entries, 'h' hours, 'd' days, 'm' months,
              'y' years, 't' the top days and 'p' the 95th percentile.
              Alternatively or in combination with mode an optional limit
              parameter can be used to limit the number of entries in the
              output. The --json option can be used in combination with -l,
              --live and -tr options without mode or limit having any effect
              to the output. The jsonversion field in the output contains the
              API version information. It will be changed only when the names
              or structures of previously existing content gets changed. In
              comparison, the vnstatversion field exists only as extra
              information.


       --limit limit
              Set the maximum number of shown entries in list outputs to
              limit.  Usage of --limit overrides the default list entry limit
              values and the optional limit parameter given directly for a
              list query. All entries stored in the database will be shown if
              limit is set to 0.  --limit can also be used to control the
              length of --json and --xml outputs.


       -l, --live [mode]
              Display current transfer rate for the selected interface in real
              time until interrupted. Statistics will be shown after
              interruption if the runtime was more than 10 seconds. An
              optional mode parameter can be used to select between the
              displaying of packets per second (mode 0) and transfer counters
              (mode 1) during execution.  --style can also be used to affect
              the layout of the output. The output will be in json format if
              used in combination with --json option.


       --locale locale
              Use locale instead of using the locale setting specified in the
              configuration file or the system default if no configuration
              file is available.


       --longhelp
              Show complete options list.


       --merge source destination
              Merge interface data from source database to destination
              database. Unless interfaces are specified, all interfaces from
              source will be merged to destination.  A new database will be
              created if destination doesn't exist. If an interface of the
              same name doesn't exist in destination then a direct copy action
              for the data from source will be executed. If an interface of
              the same name already exists in destination then an additive
              merge action will be executed. The source database is always
              accessed as read-only and will never be modified by the merge
              actions. Changes to the destination database cannot be reversed
              as subtraction actions aren't supported. Execution of the merge
              needs to be acknowledged with an additional parameter. If this
              additional parameter isn't provided then a preview of the
              actions with additional guidance will be shown.


              Both source and destination can either refer directly to
              database files or use an alternative file:interface syntax where
              the database file is suffixed with : followed with an interface
              name. When used as source, the alternative syntax allows
              specifying one interface to be merged from source to destination
              instead of all interfaces being merged. Additionally, it's
              possible to use the alternative syntax in destination for
              specifying to which interface the data will be merged to.


       -m, --months [limit]
              Show traffic statistics on a monthly basis for the last months.
              The length of the list will be limited to 12 entries unless
              configured otherwise or unless the optional limit parameter is
              used. All entries stored in the database will be shown if limit
              is set to 0.


       --oneline [mode]
              Show traffic summary for selected interface using one line with
              a parsable format. The output contains 15 fields with ; used as
              field delimiter. The 1st field contains the API version
              information of the output that will only be changed in future
              versions if the field content or structure changes. The
              following fields in order 2) interface name, 3) timestamp for
              today, 4) rx for today, 5) tx for today, 6) total for today, 7)
              average traffic rate for today, 8) timestamp for current month,
              9) rx for current month, 10) tx for current month, 11) total for
              current month, 12) average traffic rate for current month, 13)
              all time total rx, 14) all time total tx, 15) all time total
              traffic.  An optional mode parameter can be used to force all
              fields to output in bytes without the unit itself shown.


       -q, --query [mode]
              Force database query mode. An optional mode parameter can be
              used to override the default query mode. 'a' results in short
              summary output being used when there are more than one interface
              in the database, otherwise regular summary output is used. 's'
              results in regular summary output being shown for one interface
              regardless of the number of interfaces in the database. When the
              optional mode parameter isn't defined, the configured QueryMode
              will be used instead.


       --remove
              Delete the database entry for the interface specified with -i or
              --iface and stop monitoring it. The daemon can be running during
              this operation and will automatically detect the change.


       --rename name
              Rename the interface specified with -i or --iface in the
              database with new name name.  The new name cannot already exist
              in the database. This operation doesn't cause any data loss. The
              daemon should not be running during this operation.


       -ru, --rateunit [mode]
              Swap the configured rate unit. If rate has been configured to be
              shown in bytes then rate will be shown in bits if this option is
              present. In the same way, if rate has been configured to be
              shown in bits then rate will be shown in bytes when this option
              is present. Alternatively, mode with either 0 or 1 can be used
              as parameter for this option in order to select between bytes
              (0) and bits (1) regardless of the configuration file setting.


       --setalias alias
              Set alias as an alias for the selected interface to be shown in
              queries. The set alias can be removed by specifying an empty
              string for alias.  The daemon can be running during this
              operation.


       -s, --short
              Use short output mode. This mode is also used when more than one
              interface is available in the database and no specific interface
              is selected.


       --showconfig
              Show current configuration using the same format as the
              configuration file itself uses.


       --style number
              Modify the content and style of outputs. Set number to 0 for a
              narrower output, 1 for enabling bar column, 2 for same as
              previous but with average traffic rate visible in summary output
              and 3 for enabling average traffic rate in all outputs where it
              is supported. 4 disables the use of terminal control characters
              in -l, --live and -tr, --traffic modes.


       -t, --top [limit]
              Show all time top traffic days. The length of the list will be
              limited to 10 entries unless configured otherwise or unless the
              optional limit parameter is used. All entries stored in the
              database will be shown if limit is set to 0. When used with
              --begin and optionally with --end, the list will be generated
              using the daily data instead of separate top entries.  The
              availability of daily data defines the boundaries the date
              specific query can access.


       -tr, --traffic [time]
              Calculate how much traffic goes through the selected interface
              during the given time seconds. The time will be 5 seconds if a
              number parameter isn't specified. The output will be in json
              format if used in combination with --json option. However, in
              that case, the countdown before results isn't shown.  --style
              can also be used to affect the layout of the output.


       -v, --version
              Show current version.


       --xml [mode] [limit]
              Show database content for selected interface or all interfaces
              in xml format. All traffic values in the output are in bytes
              unless otherwise indicated by the name of the key. An optional
              mode parameter can be used for limiting the output to only
              selected information.  Everything except the 95th percentile
              output is shown by default. Setting mode to 's' will output a
              summary containing the last 2 entries of 5 minute, hourly,
              daily, monthly and yearly resolution data, 'f' will output only
              5 minute resolution entries, 'h' hours, 'd' days, 'm' months,
              'y' years, 't' the top days and 'p' the 95th percentile.
              Alternatively or in combination with mode an optional limit
              parameter can be used to limit the number of entries in the
              output. The xmlversion field in the output contains the API
              version information. It will be changed only when the names or
              structures of previously existing content gets changed. In
              comparison, the vnstatversion field exists only as extra
              information.


       -y, --years [limit]
              Show traffic statistics on a yearly basis for the last years.
              The list will show all entries by default unless configured
              otherwise or unless the optional limit parameter is used. All
              entries stored in the database will also be shown if limit is
              set to 0.


       -?, --help
              Show a command option summary.


FILES
       /var/lib/vnstat/
              Default database directory.


       /etc/vnstat.conf
              Config file that will be used unless $HOME/.vnstatrc exists. See
              vnstat.conf(5) for more information.


EXAMPLES
       vnstat Display traffic summary for the default interface or multiple
              interfaces when more than one is monitored.


       vnstat -i eth0+eth1+eth3
              Display traffic summary for a merge of interfaces eth0, eth1 and
              eth3.


       vnstat -i eth2 --xml
              Output all information about interface eth2 in xml format.


       vnstat --json
              Output all information of all monitored interfaces in json
              format.


       vnstat -i eth0 --setalias local
              Give interface eth0 the alias "local". That information will be
              later visible as a label when eth0 is queried.


       vnstat -i eth2 --remove
              Delete database entries for interface eth2 and stop monitoring
              it.


RESTRICTIONS
       Updates need to be executed at least as often as it is possible for the
       interface to generate enough traffic to overflow the kernel interface
       traffic counter. Otherwise, it is possible that some traffic won't be
       seen. With 32-bit interface traffic counters, the maximum time between
       two updates depends on how fast the interface can transfer 4 GiB.  Note
       that there is no guarantee that a 64-bit kernel has 64-bit interface
       traffic counters for all interfaces. Calculated theoretical times are:

              10 Mbit:        54 minutes
              100 Mbit:        5 minutes
              1000 Mbit:      30 seconds

       Virtual and aliased interfaces cannot be monitored because the kernel
       doesn't provide traffic information for that type of interfaces. Such
       interfaces are usually named eth0:0, eth0:1, eth0:2 etc. where eth0 is
       the actual interface being aliased.

       Using long date output formats may cause misalignment in shown columns
       if the length of the date exceeds the fixed size allocation.
