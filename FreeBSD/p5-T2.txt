NAME
       T2 - Object Relational mapping system

SYNOPSIS
         use T2::Storage;

         # T2::Storage class provides Tangram::Storage API and
         # loads schemas
         my $storage = T2::Storage->open("appName");
         my (@ids) = $storage->insert(@some_objects);

         # T2::Schema structures can be manipulated in the same way
         my $schema_storage = T2::Storage->open("schema");
         my $schema = T2::Schema->load("appName", $schema_storage);
         my @classes = $schema->classes;
         $schema->classes_remove(17);    # remove a random class
         $schema_storage->update($schema);

DESCRIPTION
       The T2 module is a base for the refactoring of the now quite stable
       Tangram Object-Relational mapper.

       In a nutshell, it lets you store objects - which have to be described
       to a similar level that you would describe a database to store them -
       into any SQL store.  Currently, this is tested on PostgreSQL, MySQL,
       Oracle and Sybase a lot, though in general database-specific extensions
       to SQL, such as triggers, stored procedures, etc are avoided.  So, if
       DBI installs and tests successfully with your database, there is a good
       chance that T2 will work with it too.

       The only current requirement is that objects that have tables
       associated with them are implemented via hashes.  You also have to be
       able to describe all of the fields for those root objects.  Individual
       fields of stored objects may be arbitrarily complex.

       If you are familiar with DBI, it is somewhat similar to bless'ing the
       structures returned by "$dbh->fetchrow_hashref", except that references
       and collections to other objects in the store are loaded `on demand'
       (aka Lazy-loading).

CONTENTS
       The T2:: namespace currently contains:

       T2::Storage
           T2::Storage is a convenience wrapper for Tangram::Storage.  Hence,
           the object it returns provides the complete Tangram 2 API.  It
           contains a constructor that automatically grabs configuration
           information (such as, database location, schema details, etc), and
           connects to the database.

           It makes simple programs, for existing applications that have an
           established schema very simple.  Getting the schema structures
           there in the first place, however, is not terribly straightforward.
           Yet.

           As more of the Tangram core is ported over the the new T2::Storage
           class, the documentation here and in T2::Storage will be completed.
           For now, Tangram and Tangram::Storage are the best starting points.

       T2::Schema, T2::Class, etc.
           The T2::Schema structures are the Tangram schema, expressed as
           Class::Tangram objects.  These are hence easily storable in a T2
           data store.  Or a Pixie/MLDBM/etc store, for that matter.

FREQUENTLY UNASKED QUESTIONS (FUQ)
       You might be asking, "how does one write a FUQ file?"

       One answer is by becoming maintainer of a module, and talking to people
       who have looked at a module, and seeing what drawbacks they saw, or why
       they didn't take it any further.

       How do I just quickly store an object?
           At the moment, there is no shortcut.  You must declare a simple
           schema that has the object type (or one of its superclasses) that
           you wish to store.

           Warning: the examples in this section have been quickly written,
           and there are probably some minor bugs.  If you encounter problems,
           please send a message to the mailing list (see SUPPORT).

           Creating this structure is a lot easier with the I'll-release-it-
           RSN-ware web-based VT2 tool, but here is some example code to set
           up a schema file;

             my $schema = T2::Schema->new
                 ( T2::Class->new( name => "ExampleClass",
                                   attributes => [ T2::Attribute->new
                                                   ( type => "perl_dump",
                                                     name => "foo",
                                                   ) ],
                 );

             use Storable qw(freeze);
             open FOO, ">etc/myApp.t2";
             binmode FOO;
             $Storable::Deparse = 1;
             print FOO freeze $schema;
             close FOO;

           Yes, OK, that's not exactly a one-liner.  But it should give you an
           idea of what's involved.  Again, the web-based tool to manage the
           above schema structures makes things a lot quicker.

           You'd then create a file etc/myApp.dsn, with something like the
           following contents:

             dsn dbi:mysql:database=myApp
             user myApp
             auth razamatazz
             schema myApp

           (yes, this should be YAML.  Patches welcome :))

           Then, you need to create the user and set up the database.  You can
           use the t2-migrate-db.pl utility script in the T2 distribution to
           do the latter;

             $ echo 'grant all privileges on myApp.* to myApp@localhost' \
                         identified by "razamatazz"' | mysql -uroot -p
             Password:
             $ t2-migrate-db.pl --read --deploy myApp
             ...
             $

           Still with me?  Good.  Then the script to actually use the code is
           simple;

             use T2::Storage;
             my $storage = T2::Storage->open("myApp");

             # this line makes the classes for you, if you didn't
             # already have ExampleClass written.
             $storage->schema->generator();

             # stick an object in the DB and return an object ID
             my $oid = $storage->insert(new ExampleClass(foo => "bar"));

             # anything in $exampleClass->foo can be stored (via
             # perl_dump mapping)
             use Whatever;

             # fetch the object back
             my $exampleClass = $storage->load($oid);
             $exampleClass->set_foo( { bar => new Whatever() } );
             $storage->update($exampleClass);

             $storage->insert(new ExampleClass
                                   (foo => [ 1, 2, $exampleClass ]));

           See Tangram::Tour for a more detailed example of how to manipulate
           objects in the database, and Class::Tangram for more information on
           how to use the generated constructors and accessors (eg, "new
           ExampleClass" and "set_foo" in the above example).

           You don't have to use Class::Tangram classes in a T2 store.  But
           they are very well behaved OO classes that communicate via message
           passing exclusively, and export the information needed by T2 to
           store them in a package global.  So they're convenient.

       How do I just quickly get an object out?
           If you still have the object ID, you can fetch it by that;

             my $user = $storage->load($user_oid);

           If that user has a reference to another storage object in it (what
           would normally be accomplished using an ID into another table in
           SQL), then you can just access the value; it is `demand paged' /
           `lazy loaded' via Data::Lazy or an equivalent.  For example;

             my $details = $user->details;

           If the referant object is already in memory, then the in-memory
           version is used instead of being explicitly loaded from the
           database.

           Otherwise, you can use the OO query format explained in much more
           detail in Tangram::Tour;

             my $remote_session = $storage->remote("MySession::Class");
             my ($session) = $storage->select
                                ($remote_session,
                                 $remote_session->{SID} eq $somesid);

           The query format is flexible enough to represent virtually any SQL
           query.  The "$remote_session" object is an object which represents
           an object in the database of the given type.  So, the expression
           "$remote_session-"{SID} eq $somesid> returns an object that
           represents all MySession::Class objects that have a "SID" of
           $somesid.

           Generally, people either think that this syntax is the cleanest
           method of expressing relationships in a non-SQL way possible, or,
           as one of the Pixie authors put it, you 'turn running and
           screaming'.

       OK, now how do I change the schema?
           Simply write a new etc/myApp.t2 schema file.  Modify the script
           above and re-run it.

       How does Tangram compare to XXX?
           First, you should have a look at the POOP (that's Perl Object
           Oriented Persistence ":)") summary at <http://poop.sf.net/>.

           In a nutshell, there are two types of persistence tools; SQL
           abstractors (eg, Alzabo, Class::DBI) and true Object Persistence
           tools (eg Pixie, Tangram).

           The SQL abstractors tend to require that all of your objects derive
           from a common base class.  This is encouraged with T2, but not
           required.

           The Object Persistence tools will generally let you store pretty
           much anything, without `intruding' on your objects.  In theory,
           this means that they may easily be loaded from one storage class
           and thrown into another.

       What Query languages do I use?
           See Tangram::Tour for a run-down on the query format.

       How can I manage schemas?
           Using the web-based tool that manages these T2::Schema data
           structures in a Tangram store, and the supplied utility scripts.
           The web-based application is expected to be released by Q2 2004.

       Why bother with schema maintenance at all?
           At some level, your application has a schema governing it.

           The idea with these modules is that you express it all in a
           standard way in one place, rather than keeping some in your head,
           some in the module source, some in the database tables...

       Wouldn't it be faster to roll your own indexes?
           There is an argument that it is simpler to opt for *very* simple
           data persistence, and just use your own objects for the indexes.

           The answer is, this really sucks for concurrency and transaction
           safety.  Especially as the size of the index grows.  This is one of
           the reasons you might want to use a database in the first place
           :-).

       Support for bugs is provided on a "politely state your problem with a
       test case to demonstrate the bug, and if you're lucky, someone will fix
       it for you" basis by the Tangram community.
