ZTOP(1)                 FreeBSD General Commands Manual                ZTOP(1)

NAME
     ztop – Display ZFS datasets' I/O in real time

SYNOPSIS
     ztop [-ahrV] [-d depth] [-f filter] [-t time] [-S key] [pool ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The ztop utility can be used to monitor the performance of zfs(8)
     datasets.

     The options are as follows:

     -a, --auto
             Do not display idle datasets.

     -c, --children
             Include child datasets' statistics with their parents'.  This is
             especially useful when combined with -d.

     -d, --depth depth
             Only display datasets up to the given depth.

     -f, --filter filter
             A regular expression that can be used to only show statistics for
             some datasets.  Only datasets with the names matching filter will
             be displayed.  The format of the regular expression is described
             at https://docs.rs/regex.

     -t, --time time
             Refresh the ztop display every interval seconds.  Suffixes like
             s, ms, and us are accepted.

     -r, --reverse
             Reverse the sort order

     -s, --column column
             Sort the devices by column.  The spelling of column should match
             the displayed column header.

     ztop displays performance statistics for ZFS datasets.  If one or more
     pool are specified, then only those pools' datasets will be displayed.

INTERACTIVE COMMANDS
     These commands are currently recognized.

     +       Sort by the next column to the right.

     -       Sort by the next column to the left.

     <       Halve the update interval.

     >       Double the update interval.

     a       Toggle auto mode.  This has the same effect as the --auto command
             line option.

     c       Toggle children mode.  This has the same effect as the --children
             command line option.

     D       Decrease the depth of displayed datasets.

     d       Increase the depth of displayed datasets.

     f       Display only datasets with the names matching a regular
             expression (prompt for filter expression).

     F       Remove dataset filter.

     q       Quit

     r       Toggle reverse sort.  This has the same effect as the --reverse
             command line option.

EXIT STATUS
     The ztop utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
