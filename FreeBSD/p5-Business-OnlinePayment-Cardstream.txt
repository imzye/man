                       );
               $Cardstream->submit;

               if ($Cardstream->is_success) {
                       print "Success, Auth Code is ".$Cardstream->authorization;
               } else {
                       print "Failed, Error message ".$Cardstream->error_message;
               }

               my @RESPONSE = split('\|',$Cardstream->server_response);
               my %response_hash = @RESPONSE;

Supported Cards
   Visa, MasterCard, Switch (Check website for updates)
       Switch cards require issue number; $Cardstream->content(issue => '1')

NOTES
   Merchant accounts
       A Cardstream merchant account is free of charge to set-up.  Cardstream
       operates on a commission basis. Please see http://www.cardstream.com
       for pricing information, or contact sales@cardstream.com.

   Expiration dates
       Cardstream.pm requires expiration dates in APACS/30 Standard format,
       which, unlike what is printed on the card, is YYMM.

   server-response
       The auth code and error messages are stored into
       $Cardstream->authorization and $Cardstream->error_message, however
       should you require more debugging information, server-response contains
       a pipe delimited hash consisting of the error code, text message from
       bank...etc.
