NAME
       File::Copy::Link - extension for replacing a link by a copy of the
       linked file

SYNOPSIS
         use File::Copy::Link;
         copylink 'file.lnk';

         use File::Copy::Link qw(safecopylink);
         safecopylink 'file.lnk';

DESCRIPTION
       "copylink"
           reads the filename linked to by the argument and replaced the link
           with a copy of the file.  It opens a filehandle to read from the
           link, deletes the link, and then copies the filehandle back to the
           link.

       "safecopylink"
           does the same as "copylink" but without the open-and-delete
           manouvre.  Instead, it uses "File::Spec::Link" to find the target
           of the link and copies from there.

       This module is mostly a wrapper round "File::Spec::Link::linked" and
       "File::Copy::copy", the functionality is available in a command line
       script copylink.

   EXPORT
       Nothing by default, can export "copylink", `"safecopylink".
