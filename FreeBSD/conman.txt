CONMAN(1)                 ConMan: The Console Manager                CONMAN(1)



NAME
       conman - ConMan client


SYNOPSIS
       conman [OPTION]... [CONSOLE]...


DESCRIPTION
       conman is a program for connecting to remote consoles being managed by
       conmand.  Console names can be separated by spaces and/or commas.
       Globbing is used by default to match console names against the
       configuration, but regular expression matching can be enabled with the
       '-r' option.

       conman supports three modes of console access: monitor (read-only),
       interactive (read-write), and broadcast (write-only).  If neither the
       '-m' (monitor) nor '-b' (broadcast) options are specified, the console
       session is opened in interactive mode.


OPTIONS
       -b     Broadcast to multiple consoles (write-only).  Data sent by the
              client will be copied to all specified consoles in parallel, but
              console output will not be sent back to the client.  This option
              can be used in conjunction with '-f' or '-j'.

       -d destination
              Specify the location of the conmand daemon, overriding the
              default [127.0.0.1:7890].  This location may contain a hostname
              or IP address, and be optionally followed by a colon and port
              number.

       -e character
              Specify the client escape character, overriding the default [&].

       -f     Specify that write-access to the console should be "forced",
              thereby stealing the console away from existing clients having
              write privileges.  The original clients are informed by conmand
              of who perpetrated the theft as their connections are
              terminated.

       -F file
              Read console names/patterns from file.  Only one console name
              may be specified per line.  Leading and trailing whitespace,
              blank lines, and comments (i.e., lines beginning with a '#') are
              ignored.

       -h     Display a summary of the command-line options.

       -j     Specify that write-access to the console should be "joined",
              thereby sharing the console with existing clients having write
              privileges.  The original clients are informed by conmand that a
              new client has been granted write privileges.

       -l file
              Log console session output to file.

       -L     Display license information.

       -m     Monitor a console (read-only).

       -q     Query conmand for consoles matching the specified
              names/patterns.  Output from this query can be saved to file for
              use with the '-F' option.

       -Q     Enable quiet-mode, suppressing informational messages.  This
              mode can be toggled within a console session via the '&Q'
              escape.

       -r     Match console names via regular expressions instead of globbing.

       -v     Enable verbose mode.

       -V     Display version information.


ESCAPE CHARACTERS
       The following escapes are supported and assume the default escape
       character [&]:

       &?     Display a list of currently available escapes.

       &.     Terminate the connection.

       &&     Send a single escape character.

       &B     Send a "serial-break" to the remote console.

       &E     Toggle echoing of client input.

       &F     Switch from read-only to read-write via a "force".

       &I     Display information about the connection.

       &J     Switch from read-only to read-write via a "join".

       &L     Replay up the the last 4KB of console output.  This escape
              requires the console device to have logging enabled in the
              conmand configuration.

       &M     Switch from read-write to read-only.

       &Q     Toggle quiet-mode to display/suppress informational messages.

       &R     Reset the node associated with this console.  This escape
              requires a "resetcmd" to be specified in the conmand
              configuration.

       &Z     Suspend the client.


ENVIRONMENT
       The following environment variables override the default settings.

       CONMAN_HOST
              Specifies the hostname or IP address at which to contact
              conmand, but may be overridden by the '-d' command-line option.
              A port number separated by a colon may follow the hostname
              (i.e., host:port), although the CONMAN_PORT environment variable
              takes precedence.  If not set, the default host [127.0.0.1] will
              be used.

       CONMAN_PORT
              Specifies the port on which to contact conmand, but may be
              overridden by the '-d' command-line option.  If not set, the
              default port [7890] will be used.

       CONMAN_ESCAPE
              The first character of this variable specifies the escape
              character, but may be overridden by the '-e' command-line
              option.  If not set, the default escape character [&] will be
              used.


SECURITY
       The client/server communications are not yet encrypted.
