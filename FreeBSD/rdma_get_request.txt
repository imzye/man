RDMA_GET_REQUEST(3)      Librdmacm Programmer's Manual     RDMA_GET_REQUEST(3)



NAME
       rdma_get_request - Retrieves the next pending connection request event.

SYNOPSIS
       #include <rdma/rdma_cma.h>

       int rdma_get_request (struct rdma_cm_id *listen, struct rdma_cm_id
       **id);

ARGUMENTS
       listen      Listening rdma_cm_id.

       id          rdma_cm_id associated with the new connection.

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a connection request event.  If no requests are pending, the
       call will block until an event is received.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error.  If an error occurs, errno will
       be set to indicate the failure reason.

NOTES
       This call may only be used on listening rdma_cm_id's operating
       synchronously.  On success, a new rdma_cm_id representing the
       connection request will be returned to the user.  The new rdma_cm_id
       will reference event information associated with the request until the
       user calls rdma_reject, rdma_accept, or rdma_destroy_id on the newly
       created identifier.  For a description of the event data, see
       rdma_get_cm_event.

       If QP attributes are associated with the listening endpoint, the
       returned rdma_cm_id will also reference an allocated QP.
