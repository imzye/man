NAME
       Mail::Transport - use Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs)

INHERITANCE
        Mail::Transport
          is a Mail::Reporter

        Mail::Transport is extended by
          Mail::Transport::Receive
          Mail::Transport::Send

SYNOPSIS
        my $message = Mail::Message->new(...);

        # Some extensions implement sending:
        $message->send;
        $message->send(via => 'sendmail');

        my $sender = Mail::Transport::SMTP->new(...);
        $sender->send($message);

        # Some extensions implement receiving:
        my $receiver = Mail::Transport::POP3->new(...);
        $message = $receiver->receive;

DESCRIPTION
       Objects which extend "Mail::Transport" implement sending and/or
       receiving of messages, using various protocols.

       Mail::Transport::Send extends this class, and offers general
       functionality for send protocols, like SMTP.  Mail::Transport::Receive
       also extends this class, and offers receive method.  Some transport
       protocols will implement both sending and receiving.

       Extends "DESCRIPTION" in Mail::Reporter.

METHODS
       Extends "METHODS" in Mail::Reporter.

   Constructors
       Extends "Constructors" in Mail::Reporter.

       Mail::Transport->new(%options)
            -Option    --Defined in     --Default
             executable                   undef
             hostname                     'localhost'
             interval                     30
             log         Mail::Reporter   'WARNINGS'
             password                     undef
             port                         undef
             proxy                        undef
             retry                        <false>
             timeout                      120
             trace       Mail::Reporter   'WARNINGS'
             username                     undef
             via                          'sendmail'

           executable => FILENAME
             If you specify an executable, the module does not need to search
             the system directories to figure-out where the client lives.
             Using this decreases the flexible usage of your program: moving
             your program to other systems may involve changing the path to
             the executable, which otherwise would work auto-detect and
             unmodified.

           hostname => HOSTNAME|ARRAY
             The host on which the server runs.  Some protocols accept an
             ARRAY of alternatives for this option.

           interval => SECONDS
             The time between tries to contact the remote server for sending
             or receiving a message in SECONDS.  This number must be larger
             than 0.

           log => LEVEL
           password => STRING
             Some protocols require a password to be given, usually in
             combination with a password.

           port => INTEGER
             The port number behind which the service is hiding on the remote
             server.

           proxy => PATH
             The name of the proxy software (the protocol handler).  This must
             be the name (preferable the absolute path) of your mail delivery
             software.

           retry => NUMBER|undef
             The number of retries before the sending will fail.  If "undef",
             the number of retries is unlimited.

           timeout => SECONDS
             SECONDS till time-out while establishing the connection to a
             remote server.

           trace => LEVEL
           username => STRING
             Some protocols require a user to login.

           via => CLASS|NAME
             Which CLASS (extending "Mail::Transport") will transport the
             data.  Some predefined NAMEs avoid long class names: "mail" and
             "mailx" are handled by the Mail::Transport::Mailx module,
             "sendmail" and "postfix" belong to Mail::Transport::Sendmail, and
             "smtp" is implemented in Mail::Transport::SMTP.

             The "pop" or "pop3" protocol implementation can be found
             distribution Mail::Transport::POP3.  For "imap" or "imap4",
             install Mail::Transport::IMAP4.

   Server connection
       $obj->findBinary( $name, [@directories] )
           Look for a binary with the specified $name in the directories which
           are defined to be safe.  The list of standard directories is
           followed by the optional @directories.  The full pathname is
           returned.

           You may specify new(proxy), which specifies the absolute name of
           the binary to be used.

       $obj->remoteHost()
           Returns the hostname, port number, username and password to be used
           to establish the connection to the server for sending or receiving
           mail.

       $obj->retry()
           Returns the retry interval, retry count, and timeout for the
           connection.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Warning: Avoid program abuse: specify an absolute path for $exec.
           Specifying explicit locations for executables of email transfer
           agents should only be done with absolute file names, to avoid
           various pontential security problems.

       Warning: Executable $exec does not exist.
           The explicitly indicated mail transfer agent does not exists. The
           normal settings are used to find the correct location.

       Error: Package $package does not implement $method.
           Fatal error: the specific package (or one of its superclasses) does
           not implement this method where it should. This message means that
           some other related classes do implement this method however the
           class at hand does not.  Probably you should investigate this and
           probably inform the author of the package.
