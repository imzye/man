VMM(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 VMM(4)

NAME
     vmm.ko – bhyve virtual machine monitor

SYNOPSIS
     To load the driver as a module at boot, add this line to loader.conf(5):

           vmm_load="YES"

     The module can also be loaded manually with kldload(8):

           kldload vmm

DESCRIPTION
     vmm.ko provides the kernel portion of the bhyve(4) hypervisor.

     An Intel CPU with VT-x/EPT or AMD CPU with SVM support is required.

     PCI device passthrough to a virtual machine requires hardware with VT-d
     support.

PCI PASSTHROUGH
     When the hardware supports VT-d, and vmm.ko has been loaded at boot time,
     PCI devices can be reserved for use by the hypervisor.  Entries
     consisting of the PCI bus/slot/function are added to the pptdevs
     loader.conf(5) variable.  Additional entries are separated by spaces.
     Host PCI devices that match an entry will be assigned to the hypervisor
     and will not be probed by FreeBSD device drivers.  See the EXAMPLES
     section below for sample usage.

     A large number of PCI device entries may require a string longer than the
     128-character limit of loader.conf(5) variables.  The pptdevs2 and
     pptdevs3 variables can be used for additional entries.

EXAMPLES
     Reserve three PCI devices for use by the hypervisor: bus 10 slot 0
     function 0, bus 6 slot 5 function 0, and bus 6 slot 5 function 1.

           pptdevs="10/0/0 6/5/0 6/5/1"
