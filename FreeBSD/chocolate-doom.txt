NAME
       chocolate-doom.cfg - Chocolate Doom configuration file

DESCRIPTION
       chocolate-doom.cfg is a configuration file for chocolate-doom(6).  This
       file acts as an auxiliary configuration file; the main configuration
       options are stored in default.cfg, which contains the same
       configuration options as Vanilla Doom (for compatibility).
       chocolate-doom.cfg contains configuration options that are specific to
       Chocolate-Doom only.

       chocolate-doom.cfg is normally stored in the user's home directory, as
       ~/.local/share/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom.cfg.  The path can be
       overridden using the XDG_DATA_HOME environment variable (see the XDG
       Base Directory Specification).

       The chocolate-doom-setup(6) tool provides a simple to use front-end for
       editing chocolate-doom.cfg.

FILE FORMAT
       The file format is the same as that used for default.cfg(5).


CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
       video_driver
              Name of the SDL video driver to use.  If this is an empty
              string, the default video driver is used.

       window_position
              Position of the window on the screen when running in windowed
              mode. Accepted values are: "" (empty string) - don't care,
              "center" - place window at center of screen, "x,y" - place
              window at the specified coordinates.

       fullscreen
              If non-zero, the game will run in full screen mode.  If zero,
              the game will run in a window.

       video_display
              Index of the display on which the game should run. This has no
              effect if running in windowed mode (fullscreen=0) and
              window_position is not set to "center".

       aspect_ratio_correct
              If non-zero, the screen will be stretched vertically to display
              correctly on a square pixel video mode.

       integer_scaling
              If non-zero, forces integer scales for resolution-independent
              rendering.

       window_width
              Window width when running in windowed mode.

       window_height
              Window height when running in windowed mode.

       fullscreen_width
              Width for screen mode when running fullscreen. If this and
              fullscreen_height are both set to zero, we run fullscreen as a
              desktop window that covers the entire screen, rather than ever
              switching screen modes. It should usually be unnecessary to set
              this value.

       fullscreen_height
              Height for screen mode when running fullscreen. See
              documentation for fullscreen_width.

       force_software_renderer
              If non-zero, force the use of a software renderer. For use on
              systems lacking hardware acceleration.

       max_scaling_buffer_pixels
              Maximum number of pixels to use for intermediate scaling buffer.
              More pixels mean that the screen can be rendered more precisely,
              but there are diminishing returns on quality. The default limits
              to 16,000,000 pixels, which is enough to cover 4K monitor
              standards.

       startup_delay
              Number of milliseconds to wait on startup after the video mode
              has been set, before the game will start.  This allows the
              screen to settle on some monitors that do not display an image
              for a brief interval after changing video modes.

       show_endoom
              If non-zero, the ENDOOM text screen is displayed when exiting
              the game. If zero, the ENDOOM screen is not displayed.

       show_diskicon
              If non-zero, a disk activity indicator is displayed when data is
              read from disk. If zero, the disk activity indicator is not
              displayed.

       png_screenshots
              If non-zero, save screenshots in PNG format. If zero,
              screenshots are saved in PCX format, as Vanilla Doom does.

       snd_samplerate
              Sound output sample rate, in Hz.  Typical values to use are
              11025, 22050, 44100 and 48000.

       snd_cachesize
              Maximum number of bytes to allocate for caching converted sound
              effects in memory. If set to zero, there is no limit applied.

       snd_maxslicetime_ms
              Maximum size of the output sound buffer size in milliseconds.
              Sound output is generated periodically in slices. Higher values
              might be more efficient but will introduce latency to the sound
              output. The default is 28ms (one slice per tic with the 35fps
              timer).

       snd_pitchshift
              If non-zero, sound effects will have their pitch varied up or
              down by a random amount during play. If zero, sound effects play
              back at their default pitch.

       snd_musiccmd
              External command to invoke to perform MIDI playback. If set to
              the empty string, SDL_mixer's internal MIDI playback is used.
              This only has any effect when snd_musicdevice is set to General
              MIDI output.

       snd_dmxoption
              Value to set for the DMXOPTION environment variable. If this
              contains "-opl3", output for an OPL3 chip is generated when in
              OPL MIDI playback mode.

       opl_io_port
              The I/O port to use to access the OPL chip.  Only relevant when
              using native OPL music playback.

       use_libsamplerate
              Controls whether libsamplerate support is used for performing
              sample rate conversions of sound effects.  Support for this must
              be compiled into the program. If zero, libsamplerate support is
              disabled.  If non-zero, libsamplerate is enabled. Increasing
              values roughly correspond to higher quality conversion; the
              higher the quality, the slower the conversion process.  Linear
              conversion = 1; Zero order hold = 2; Fast Sinc filter = 3;
              Medium quality Sinc filter = 4; High quality Sinc filter = 5.

       libsamplerate_scale
              Scaling factor used by libsamplerate. This is used when
              converting sounds internally back into integer form; normally it
              should not be necessary to change it from the default value. The
              only time it might be needed is if a PWAD file is loaded that
              contains very loud sounds, in which case the conversion may
              cause sound clipping and the scale factor should be reduced. The
              lower the value, the quieter the sound effects become, so it
              should be set as high as is possible without clipping occurring.

       autoload_path
              Full path to a directory in which WAD files and dehacked patches
              can be placed to be automatically loaded on startup. A
              subdirectory of this directory matching the IWAD name is checked
              to find the files to load.

       music_pack_path
              Full path to a directory containing configuration files for
              substitute music packs. These packs contain high quality
              renderings of game music to be played instead of using the
              system's built-in MIDI playback.

       fsynth_chorus_active
              If 1, activate the FluidSynth chorus effects module. If 0, no
              chorus will be added to the output signal.

       fsynth_chorus_depth
              Specifies the modulation depth of the FluidSynth chorus. Default
              is 5.0, range is 0.0 to 256.0.

       fsynth_chorus_level
              Specifies the output amplitude of the FluidSynth chorus signal.
              Default is 0.35, range is 0.0 to 10.0.

       fsynth_chorus_nr
              Sets the voice count of the FluidSynth chorus signal. Default is
              3, range is 0 to 99.

       fsynth_chorus_speed
              Sets the FluidSynth chorus modulation speed in Hz. Default is
              0.3, range is 0.1 to 5.0.

       fsynth_midibankselect
              This setting defines how FluidSynth interprets Bank Select
              messages. The default is "gs". Other possible values are "gm",
              "xg" and "mma".

       fsynth_polyphony
              Sets the number of FluidSynth voices that can be played in
              parallel. Default is 256, range is 1 - 65535.

       fsynth_reverb_active
              If 1, activate the FluidSynth reverb effects module. If 0, no
              reverb will be added to the output signal.

       fsynth_reverb_damp
              Sets the amount of FluidSynth reverb damping. Default is 0.4,
              range is 0.0 to 1.0.

       fsynth_reverb_level
              Sets the FluidSynth reverb amplitude. Default is 0.15, range is
              0.0 - 1.0.

       fsynth_reverb_roomsize
              Sets the room size(i.e. amount of wet) FluidSynth reverb.
              Default is 0.6, range is 0.0 - 1.0.

       fsynth_reverb_width
              Sets the stereo spread of the FluidSynth reverb signal. Default
              is 0.4, range is 0.0 - 100.0.

       fsynth_gain
              Fine tune the FluidSynth output level. Default is 1.0, range is
              0.0 - 10.0.

       fsynth_sf_path
              Full path to a soundfont file to use with FluidSynth MIDI
              playback.

       timidity_cfg_path
              Full path to a Timidity configuration file to use for MIDI
              playback. The file will be evaluated from the directory where it
              is evaluated, so there is no need to add "dir" commands into it.

       gus_patch_path
              Path to GUS patch files to use when operating in GUS emulation
              mode.

       gus_ram_kb
              Number of kilobytes of RAM to use in GUS emulation mode. Valid
              values are 256, 512, 768 or 1024.

       winmm_midi_device
              MIDI device for native Windows MIDI.

       winmm_complevel
              Compatibility level for native Windows MIDI, default 0. Valid
              values are 0 (Vanilla), 1 (Standard), 2 (Full).

       winmm_reset_type
              Reset device type for native Windows MIDI, default 1. Valid

       winmm_reset_delay
              Reset device delay for native Windows MIDI, default 0, median
              value 100 ms.

       vanilla_savegame_limit
              If non-zero, the Vanilla savegame limit is enforced; if the
              savegame exceeds 180224 bytes in size, the game will exit with
              an error.  If this has a value of zero, there is no limit to the
              size of savegames.

       vanilla_demo_limit
              If non-zero, the Vanilla demo size limit is enforced; the game
              exits with an error when a demo exceeds the demo size limit
              (128KiB by default).  If this has a value of zero, there is no
              limit to the size of demos.

       vanilla_keyboard_mapping
              If non-zero, the game behaves like Vanilla Doom, always assuming
              an American keyboard mapping.  If this has a value of zero, the
              native keyboard mapping of the keyboard is used.

       player_name
              Name to use in network games for identification.  This is only
              used on the "waiting" screen while waiting for the game to
              start.

       grabmouse
              If this is non-zero, the mouse will be "grabbed" when running in
              windowed mode so that it can be used as an input device. When
              running full screen, this has no effect.

       novert If non-zero, all vertical mouse movement is ignored.  This
              emulates the behavior of the "novert" tool available under DOS
              that performs the same function.

       mouse_acceleration
              Mouse acceleration factor.  When the speed of mouse movement
              exceeds the threshold value (mouse_threshold), the speed is
              multiplied by this value.

       mouse_threshold
              Mouse acceleration threshold.  When the speed of mouse movement
              exceeds this threshold value, the speed is multiplied by an
              acceleration factor (mouse_acceleration).

       mouseb_nextweapon
              Mouse button to cycle to the next weapon.

       dclick_use
              If non-zero, double-clicking a mouse button acts like pressing
              the "use" key to use an object in-game, eg. a door or switch.

       joystick_guid
              SDL GUID string indicating the joystick to use. An empty string
              indicates that no joystick is configured.

       joystick_index
              Index of SDL joystick to use; this is only used in the case
              where multiple identical joystick devices are connected which
              have the same GUID, to distinguish between devices.

       use_analog
              If non-zero, use analog movement when playing with a gamepad.
