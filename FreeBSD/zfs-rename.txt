ZFS-RENAME(8)           FreeBSD System Manager's Manual          ZFS-RENAME(8)

NAME
     zfs-rename – rename ZFS dataset

SYNOPSIS
     zfs rename [-f] filesystem|volume|snapshot filesystem|volume|snapshot
     zfs rename -p [-f] filesystem|volume filesystem|volume
     zfs rename -u [-f] filesystem filesystem
     zfs rename -r snapshot snapshot

DESCRIPTION
     zfs rename [-f] filesystem|volume|snapshot filesystem|volume|snapshot

     zfs rename -p [-f] filesystem|volume filesystem|volume

     zfs rename -u [-f] filesystem filesystem
       Renames the given dataset.  The new target can be located anywhere in
       the ZFS hierarchy, with the exception of snapshots.  Snapshots can only
       be renamed within the parent file system or volume.  When renaming a
       snapshot, the parent file system of the snapshot does not need to be
       specified as part of the second argument.  Renamed file systems can
       inherit new mount points, in which case they are unmounted and
       remounted at the new mount point.

       -f  Force unmount any file systems that need to be unmounted in the
           process.  This flag has no effect if used together with the -u
           flag.

       -p  Creates all the nonexistent parent datasets.  Datasets created in
           this manner are automatically mounted according to the mountpoint
           property inherited from their parent.

       -u  Do not remount file systems during rename.  If a file system's
           mountpoint property is set to legacy or none, the file system is
           not unmounted even if this option is not given.

     zfs rename -r snapshot snapshot
       Recursively rename the snapshots of all descendent datasets.  Snapshots
       are the only dataset that can be renamed recursively.
