NAME
       use-devel-assertos - a script to package Devel::AssertOS modules with
       your code.

DESCRIPTION
       This script, when run in the directory in which your shiny new module
       lives, will bundle whichever Devel::AssertOS modules you ask it to in
       the "inc" directory, and update your Makefile.PL (or Build.PL)
       appropriately.  If neither exists, it will create a Makefile.PL.  The
       MANIFEST file is updated if any files are created.

SYNOPSIS
           use-devel-assertos NetBSD OpenBSD FreeBSD

       But note that if you use "Module::Install" you are encouraged to use
       "Module::Install::AssertOS" instead.

USAGE
       In the example above, this will insert code to make your module depend
       on one of the specified OSes, as well as update Makefile.PL / Build.PL
       / MANIFEST.  By default it's rather noisy, but you can suppress that by
       passing -q as the first parameter.

SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
       To get a list of supported platforms, do this:

           use-devel-assertos -l

WARNINGS, BUGS and FEEDBACK
       This script has not been thoroughly tested.  You should check by hand
       that it has done what you expected after running it.

       If you use Module::Build::Compat to write a Makefile.PL, then you will
       need to re-run this script whenever you have generated a new
       Makefile.PL.

       I welcome feedback about my code, including constructive criticism.
       Bug reports should be made using
       <https://github.com/DrHyde/perl-modules-Devel-CheckOS/issues>.
