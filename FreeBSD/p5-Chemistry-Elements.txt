Chemistry::Elements(3)                     User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       Chemistry::Elements - Perl extension for working with Chemical Elements

SYNOPSIS
         use Chemistry::Elements qw(get_name get_Z get_symbol);

         # the constructor can use different input
         $element = Chemistry::Elements->new( $atomic_number   );
         $element = Chemistry::Elements->new( $chemical_symbol );
         $element = Chemistry::Elements->new( $element_name    );

         # you can make up your own attributes by specifying
         # a method (which is really AUTOLOAD)
               $element->molar_mass(22.989) #sets the attribute
         $MM = $element->molar_mass         #retrieves the value

DESCRIPTION
       There are two parts to the module:  the object stuff and the exportable
       functions for use outside of the object stuff.  The exportable
       functions are discussed in "Exportable functions".

       Chemistry::Elements provides an easy, object-oriented way to keep track
       of your chemical data.  Using either the atomic number, chemical
       symbol, or element name you can construct an Element object.  Once you
       have an element object, you can associate your data with the object by
       making up your own methods, which the AUTOLOAD function handles.  Since
       each chemist is likely to want to use his or her own data, or data for
       some unforesee-able property, this module does not try to be a
       repository for chemical data.

       The Element object constructor tries to be as flexible as possible -
       pass it an atomic number, chemical symbol, or element name and it tries
       to create the object.

         # the constructor can use different input
         $element = Chemistry::Elements->new( $atomic_number );
         $element = Chemistry::Elements->new( $chemical_symbol );
         $element = Chemistry::Elements->new( $element_name );

       Once you have the object, you can define your own methods simply by
       using them.  Giving the method an argument (others will be ignored)
       creates an attribute with the method's name and the argument's value.

         # you can make up your own attributes by specifying
         # a method (which is really AUTOLOAD)
               $element->molar_mass(22.989) #sets the attribute
         $MM = $element->molar_mass         #retrieves the value

       The atomic number, chemical symbol, and element name can be retrieved
       in the same way.

          $atomic_number = $element->Z;
          $name          = $element->name;
          $symbol        = $element->symbol;

       These methods can also be used to set values, although changing any of
       the three affects the other two.

          $element       = Chemistry::Elements->new('Lead');

          $atomic_number = $element->Z;    # $atomic_number is 82

          $element->Z(79);

          $name          = $element->name; # $name is 'Gold'

   Instance methods
       new( Z | SYMBOL | NAME )
           Create a new instance from either the atomic number, symbol, or
           element name.

       can( METHOD [, METHOD ... ] )
           Returns true if the package or object can respond to METHOD. This
           distinguishes between class and instance methods.

       Z   Return the atomic number of the element.

       name
           Return the name of the element.

       symbol
           Return the symbol of the element.

   Exportable functions
       These functions can be exported.  They are not exported by default. At
       the moment, only the functional interface supports multi-language
       names.

       get_symbol( NAME|Z )
           This function attempts to return the symbol of the chemical element
           given either the chemical symbol, element name, or atmoic number.
           The function does its best to interpret inconsistent input data
           (e.g.  chemcial symbols of mixed and single case).

                   use Chemistry::Elements qw(get_symbol);

                   $name = get_symbol('Fe');     #$name is 'Fe'
                   $name = get_symbol('fe');     #$name is 'Fe'
                   $name = get_symbol(26);       #$name is 'Fe'
                   $name = get_symbol('Iron');   #$name is 'Fe'
                   $name = get_symbol('iron');   #$name is 'Fe'

           If no symbol can be found, nothing is returned.

           Since this function will return the symbol if it is given a symbol,
           you can use it to test whether a string is a chemical symbol
           (although you have to play some tricks with case since get_symbol
           will try its best despite the case of the input data).

                   if( lc($string) eq lc( get_symbol($string) ) )
                           {
                           #stuff
                           }

           You can modify the symbols (e.g. you work for UCal ;) ) by changing
           the data at the end of this module.

       get_name( SYMBOL|NAME|Z [, LANGUAGE] )
           This function attempts to return the name the chemical element
           given either the chemical symbol, element name, or atomic number.
           The function does its best to interpret inconsistent input data
           (e.g.  chemical symbols of mixed and single case).

                   $name = get_name('Fe');     #$name is 'Iron'
                   $name = get_name('fe');     #$name is 'Iron'
                   $name = get_name(26);       #$name is 'Iron'
                   $name = get_name('Iron');   #$name is 'Iron'
                   $name = get_name('iron');   #$name is 'Iron'

           If no Z can be found, nothing is returned.

           Since this function will return the name if it is given a name, you
           can use it to test whether a string is a chemical element name
           (although you have to play some tricks with case since get_name
           will try its best despite the case of the input data).

                   if( lc($string) eq lc( get_name($string) ) )
                           {
                           #stuff
                           }

           You can modify the names (e.g. for different languages) by changing
           the data at the end of this module.

       get_Z( SYMBOL|NAME|Z )
           This function attempts to return the atomic number of the chemical
           element given either the chemical symbol, element name, or atomic
           number.  The function does its best to interpret inconsistent input
           data (e.g. chemcial symbols of mixed and single case).

                   $name = get_Z('Fe');     #$name is 26
                   $name = get_Z('fe');     #$name is 26
                   $name = get_Z(26);       #$name is 26
                   $name = get_Z('Iron');   #$name is 26
                   $name = get_Z('iron');   #$name is 26

           If no Z can be found, nothing is returned.

           Since this function will return the Z if it is given a Z, you can
           use it to test whether a string is an atomic number.  You might
           want to use the string comparison in case the $string is not a
           number (in which case the comparison will be false save for the
           case when $string is undefined).

                   if( $string eq get_Z($string) ) {
                           #stuff
                           }

       The package constructor automatically finds the largest defined atomic
       number (in case you add your own heavy elements).

   AUTOLOADing methods
       You can pseudo-define additional methods to associate data with
       objects.  For instance, if you wanted to add a molar mass attribute,
       you simply pretend that there is a molar_mass method:

               $element->molar_mass($MM); #add molar mass datum in $MM to object

       Similarly, you can retrieve previously set values by not specifying an
       argument to your pretend method:

               $datum = $element->molar_mass();

               #or without the parentheses
               $datum = $element->molar_mass;

       If a value has not been associated with the pretend method and the
       object, the pretend method returns nothing.

       I had thought about providing basic data for the elements, but thought
       that anyone using this module would probably have their own data.  If
       there is an interest in canned data, perhaps I can provide mine :)

   Localization support
       XXX: Fill this stuff in later. For now see the test suite

TO DO
       I would like make this module easily localizable so that one could
       specify other names or symbols for the elements (i.e. a different
       language or a different perspective on the heavy elements).  If anyone
       should make changes to the data, i would like to get a copy so that i
       can include it in future releases :)
