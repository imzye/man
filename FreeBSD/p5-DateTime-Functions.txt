DateTime::Functions(3)                     User Contributed Perl Documentation


NAME
       DateTime::Functions - Procedural interface to DateTime functions

SYNOPSIS
           use DateTime::Functions;
           print today->year;
           print now->strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S");

DESCRIPTION
       This module simply exports all class methods of DateTime into the
       caller's namespace.

METHODS
       Unless otherwise noted, all methods correspond to the same-named class
       method in DateTime.  Please see DateTime for which parameters are
       supported.

   Constructors
       All constructors can die when invalid parameters are given.  They all
       return "DateTime" objects, except for duration() which returns a
       "DateTime::Duration" object.
