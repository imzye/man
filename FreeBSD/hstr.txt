HSTR(1)                 FreeBSD General Commands Manual                HSTR(1)

NAME
       hstr -  easily view, navigate, sort and use your command history with
       shell history suggest box.

SYNOPSIS
       hstr [option] [arg1] [arg2]...

DESCRIPTION
       hstr uses shell history to provide suggest box like functionality for
       commands used in the past. By default it parses .bash-history file that
       is filtered as you type a command substring. Commands are not just
       filtered, but also ordered by a ranking algorithm that considers number
       of occurences, length and timestamp.  Favorite and frequently used
       commands can be bookmarked. In addition hstr allows removal of commands
       from history - for instance with a typo or with a sensitive content.
