NAME
       XML::CommonNS - A list of commonly used namespaces

SYNOPSIS
               # import $RDF, $RDFS, $OWL, $DC
               use XML::CommonNS qw(RDF RDFS OWL DC);

               my %CONFIG = (
                   Namespaces    => {
                       rdf  => "$RDF",
                       rdfs => "$RDFS",
                       owl  => "$OWL",
                       foaf => "$FOAF",
                   },
                   ExpandQNames => 1,
               );

               # or the uri() method

               my $foaf = XML::CommonNS->uri('FOAF');

DESCRIPTION All you need do to use this module is import the namespaces you
       want from the list below. All of those will then become available to
       you. They are XML::NamespaceFactory object and can thus be used both as
       simple strings and as XML::NamespaceFactory objects. See
       XML::NamespaceFactory for how that may help you.

       I hesitated for a while before releasing this module. As a directory of
       namespaces that can't (and almost certainly shouldn't) be exhaustive,
       it implies editorial decisions and I wasn't certain it was CPAN worthy.
       However, after getting really tired of tracking down namespaces in
       every single small XML muning script I made, I wrote it for myself.
       After a while using it, I don't see why others wouldn't find it useful
       as well.

NAMESPACES
       The currently available namespaces are listed below. Should you
       consider one worthy of addition (it needs to be common enough) please
       simply notify me. Those marked with a start are subject to change. I
       WILL change them when the corresponding specification changes.
