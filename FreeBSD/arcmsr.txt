ARCMSR(4)              FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual              ARCMSR(4)

NAME
     arcmsr – Areca RAID Controller driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device pci
           device scbus
           device da
           device arcmsr

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           arcmsr_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The arcmsr driver provides support for the Areca ARC-11xx, ARC-12xx,
     ARC-13xx, ARC-16xx and ARC-18xx series of SAS and SATA RAID controllers.
     These controllers feature RAID-0, 1, 3, 5, 6, and 10 and JBOD
     acceleration for up to 16 SATA drives.  RAID level and stripe level
     migration, online capacity expansion, hot insertion/removal, automatic
     failover and rebuild, and SMART are also supported.  Access to the arrays
     is provided via the SCSI CAM /dev/da? device nodes.  A management
     interface is also present via the /dev/arcmsr? device node.  Management
     tools for i386 and amd64 are available from Areca.

HISTORY
     The arcmsr driver first appeared in FreeBSD 5.4.

AUTHORS
     The driver was written by Erich Chen <erich@areca.com.tw>.

BUGS
     The driver has been tested on i386 and amd64.  It likely requires
     additional work to function on big-endian architectures.
