PAM_DENY(8)             FreeBSD System Manager's Manual            PAM_DENY(8)

NAME
     pam_deny – Deny PAM module

SYNOPSIS
     [service-name] module-type control-flag pam_deny [options]

DESCRIPTION
     The Deny authentication service module for PAM, pam_deny provides
     functionality for all the PAM categories: authentication, account
     management, session management and password management.  In terms of the
     module-type parameter, these are the “auth”, “account”, “session”, and
     “password” features.

     The Deny module will universally deny all requests.  It is primarily of
     use during testing, and to “null-out” unwanted functionality.

     The following options may be passed to the module:

     debug        syslog(3) debugging information at LOG_DEBUG level.

     no_warn      suppress warning messages to the user.  These messages
                  include reasons why the user's authentication attempt was
                  declined.
