USAGE
       Run the binary in your Sway session by adding to your config:

           exec wl-paste -t text --watch clipman store

       or to log errors:

           exec wl-paste -t text --watch clipman store \
               1>> PATH/TO/LOGFILE 2>&1

       It is highly recommended that you run clipman with the --no-persist
       option, see KNOWN ISSUES.

       For primary clipboard support, also add:

           exec wl-paste -p -t text --watch clipman store -P \
               --histpath="~/.local/share/clipman-primary.json"

       note that both the `-p` in wl-paste and the `-P` in clipman are
       mandatory in this case.

       To query the history and select items, run the binary as

           clipman pick -t wofi

       You can assign it to a keybinding:

           bindsym $mod+h exec clipman pick -t wofi

       You can pass additional arguments to the selector like this:

           clipman pick --tool wofi -T'--prompt=my-prompt -i'

       both `--prompt` and `-i` are flags of wofi.

       You can use a custom selector like this:

           clipman pick --print0 --tool=CUSTOM --tool-args= \
               "fzf --prompt 'pick > ' --bind 'tab:up' --cycle --read0"

       To only paste if there's something selected:

           bindsym $mod+v exec "clipman pick -t wofi --err-on-no-selection \
               && wtype -M ctrl -M shift v"

       To remove items from history:

           clipman clear -t wofi
           clipman clear --all

       To serve the last history item at startup, add this to your Sway
       config:

           exec clipman restore


BUGS
       When you experience a clipboard-related bug, try to see if it still
       happens without clipman running, as it's more likely to be caused by
       one of our own known issues rather than wl-clipboard.

KNOWN ISSUES
       We only support plain text.

       By default, we continue serving the last copied item even after its
       owner has exited.  This means that, unless you run with the
       --no-persist option, you'll always immediately lose rich content; for
       example: vim's visual block mode breaks; copying images in Firefox
       breaks; if you copy a bookmark in Firefox, you won't be able to paste
       it in another bookmark folder; if you copy formatted text inside Libre
       Office you'll lose all formatting on paste.

       Run clipman store with the --no-persist option if you are affected.
       Unfortunately, it seems that there is no way to make them play well
       together.

                                                                    clipman(1)
