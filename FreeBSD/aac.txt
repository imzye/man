AAC(4)                 FreeBSD Kernel Interfaces Manual                 AAC(4)

NAME
     aac – Adaptec AdvancedRAID Controller driver

SYNOPSIS
     To compile this driver into the kernel, place the following lines in your
     kernel configuration file:

           device pci
           device aac
           device aacp

           To compile in debugging code:
           options AAC_DEBUG=N

     Alternatively, to load the driver as a module at boot time, place the
     following line in loader.conf(5):

           aac_load="YES"

DESCRIPTION
     The aac driver provides support for the Adaptec AAC family of SCSI
     Ultra2, Ultra160, and Ultra320, SATA and SAS RAID controllers.

     Access to RAID containers is available via the /dev/aacd? device nodes.
     The aacp device enables the SCSI pass-thru interface and allows devices
     connected to the card such as CD-ROMs to be available via the CAM scsi(4)
     subsystem.  Note that not all cards allow this interface to be enabled.

     The /dev/aac? device nodes provide access to the management interface of
     the controller.  One node exists per installed card.  The aliases
     /dev/afa? and /dev/hpn? exist for compatibility with the Dell and HP
     versions of management tools, respectively.  If the kernel is compiled
     with the COMPAT_LINUX option, or the aac_linux.ko and linux.ko modules
     are loaded, the Linux-compatible ioctl(2) interface for the management
     device will be enabled and will allow Linux-based management applications
     to control the card.

DIAGNOSTICS
     Compiling with AAC_DEBUG set to a number between 0 and 3 will enable
     increasingly verbose debug messages.

     The adapter can send status and alert messages asynchronously to the
     driver.  These messages are printed on the system console, and are also
     queued for retrieval by a management application.

HISTORY
     The aac driver first appeared in FreeBSD 4.3.

BUGS
     This driver is not compatible with Dell controllers that have version 1.x
     firmware.  The firmware version is the same as the kernel version printed
     in the BIOS POST and driver attach messages.

     The controller is not actually paused on suspend/resume.
