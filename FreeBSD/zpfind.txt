PFIND(9)               FreeBSD Kernel Developer's Manual              PFIND(9)

NAME
     pfind, zpfind – locate a process by number

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <sys/proc.h>

     struct proc *
     pfind(pid_t pid);

     struct proc *
     zpfind(pid_t pid);

DESCRIPTION
     pfind() takes a pid as its argument and returns a pointer to the proc
     structure whose PID is specified in the argument only if the pid is on
     the allproc list.

     zpfind() takes a pid as its argument.  If zpfind() finds a process whose
     PID is equal to that of argument and is a zombie process, meaning that it
     must reside on the zombproc list, zpfind() returns a pointer to that proc
     structure.

     Both pfind() and zpfind() lock the proc structure that is returned using
     PROC_LOCK(p).

RETURN VALUES
     pfind() and zpfind() return a pointer to a proc structure on success and
     a NULL on failure.
